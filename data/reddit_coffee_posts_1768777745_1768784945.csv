1qgq14q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1qgq14q/my_messy_marriagedivorce/,My messy marriage/divorce,"This is a rant post mostly! 

Sorry for the book, and probably a bunch of grammar and spelling mistakes! lol 

My ex husband (27m) and I(26f)were  divorced in 2024. throughout our 5 year relationship ,2 of those years married, I worked and brought in the most of the money as he would often quit his jobs as it wasn’t what “felt right for him” so he would never keep a job. He was unemployed a lot of our relationship, as I worked hard and made sure I was bringing in money paying for almost everything! (Also going into debt as one income doesn’t cover everything a two person household needs) and when he had any money he would buy video games, action figures, weed and other random things, I even worked through having two surgeries (I had cancer) so I could have enough hours to be on unemployment and heal. Through my cancer journey he became often angry with me (kinda felt like he was almost jealous I got special treatment and an excuse to not work) he would often use my cancer to have people feel bad for him often crying he was worried I was going to die, that didn’t help me very much with my depression, but if I brought up any mental issues I was having he would turn it around to him and how he has it worse. I felt very alone throughout this time spent a lot of my time by myself becoming depressed and I was weak and had a hard time keeping the household chores up. So the house became messy but I would try to do what I could. As I started to feel better I went back to work at a summer position I had done before, that year he proposed. Here’s how he did it 

\- We are watching tv 

\-“ I got this for you but couldn’t think of a way to do it” 

\-pulls out ring 

\-“Will you marry me” 

\- I said yes for some reason

That summer we got married.

I was hoping me being better now would help fix our relationship and how being married would help. It did not. I will admit I started becoming distant as none of my emotional needs became met and anytime I vocalized it, it would end with him crying, apologizing, becoming almost hysteric to a point I’d be like it’s okay so he would stop (he started banging his head against a wall once) but he would never change or do anything to make me feel special 

For example once on my birthday he wasn’t getting enough attention from the friend group at the bar so he threw a fit and went home threatening to unalive himself, so we had to leave ending my birthday early, most of my birthdays ended this way with me crying 

Also one Christmas we had a $300 limit for gifts for each other! I went to his friends asking about video games and got him plenty of stuff I knew he would love, and he did! And he got me $300 worth of edibles (knowing I didn’t do that very often) then since I didn’t eat them all fast enough (I had two) he proceeded to eat all of them on me, he basically would only buy me things that he actually wanted. 

Those are just examples of a couple things but there are SO many more instances that are similar! 

So yes I became distant and bitter, i probably should have left at the first few signs, but felt kinda stuck and thought some the way he was acting was probably my fault and i wasn’t meeting his needs, mostly sexual on his part (he had some kinks that were too much for me, or most people honestly) and would become mad if I wouldn’t do it knowing for me I felt uncomfortable and some of it was just painful for me, and there was one night where a line was crossed while I was drunkenly passed out and I woke up with him “using me” and I was so drunk and tired I passed out again, (I was not black out drunk) and I asked him about it in the morning but he denied it, but after going pee I could tell. But ignored it and didn’t tell anyone as we were married and thought it’s part of the deal I guess 🤦‍♀️

Anyway, that’s a taste of our relationship. the last few months of our marriage I was working crazy hours while he sat at home not working or bringing in any money. playing video games not lifting a finger to clean anything at all, I worked at a coffee shop and he would come get my tips through the day so he could get take out while I was living off 99c noodles, after work everyday I went to take care of my horses (kept at his parents) and work and ride them. Along came my friend let’s call him Tom, he would come out with one of the girls I rode with but then her and I had a falling out but Tom and I stayed friends and he would come along riding as he enjoyed it often with a mutual friend (who is gay) and my ex MIL would come out with us too! 

But since Tom and I got along well and became decent friends my ex husband started saying I was cheating on him! ( Tom and I never hung out alone! any time we were together our mutual friend would be there and often my ex best friend -ill get to that- and my ex husbands MOM was also there too 🤦‍♀️) and my ex was always invited to come and I would also tell him who’s coming to the barn. 

But the last week before I left him I found I was becoming emotional attached to Tom and he was good to me and we could laugh a lot so once i realized that, i decided to leave my ex husband and I did! I realized that feeling is wrong and unfair to my ex but I made sure to leave him when i understood my feelings. But I didn’t want to be with Tom btw but knew if I could feel like that towards anyone, but my husband, I’m not in love with him and we both should move on! 

I left with no place to live, no vehicle (I sold my car for us to buy a truck but it was in his name) and with all the debt, asking nothing of him, 

well, him and his mom became crazy! She gave me less then a week to move the horses after screaming at me and my ex best friend and chasing her off the property having to be held back from punching her and almost ripping her window out of her car, all because I wanted to keep it all civil and be able to communicate to my ex throughout out the divorce to keep the peace! As it’s a small town, but because of his mom that didn’t happen. 

Anyway, I got my horses out in two days! And all my stuff at the barn. Then the ex MIL started telling people I was keeping the horses from her and took them away from

Her 🤦‍♀️ —crazy 

So having nothing and feeling hopeless i started becoming depressed and really not caring if I woke up the next day, so i started drinking a lot and indulging in things im not proud of but was part of the journey I needed to take! Well on one of those party nights Tom was there both of us going through a weird time and drinking, yes we hooked up (a month after I left my ex) we both kinda regretted it but I was hoping we could kinda ignore it and go back to being friends but he became distant and weird so yes I felt hurt, and vented about it to my ex best friend! 

For context by that point my ex husband had been reaching out to a bunch of women trying to hook up, and a lot of them being friends of mine! Who obviously reached out to me letting me know!  

And now why my ex best friend and I don’t talk anymore after 10 years! To start she had just started dating my ex husbands friend a few months before I left him! So i understand the awkward position she was in, 

So to start i obviously went to her when I left! And confided in her about all the things I had been keeping in including that drunk night he basically SAed me something I had kept in as I was feeling uncomfortable and scared to ever talk about how it made me feel. After I went to her we had a great talk and laughed and cried was a good much needed night. 

Well after that night she went to her bf about about everything I said ( I don’t really mind you should be able to talk with you partner about things) but he doesn’t know me well at all, and he basically responded to her that I’m making it up to accuse my ex and make the divorce easier (not true, I never planned on making it a thing just needed to finally talk about it with someone I thought I could trust) and her bf also said even if it was true it’s marital consent and he had every right to do so! So because she has a habit of changing her whole personality to the people she’s dating, she agreed with him then came back at me repeating what he said making how I felt invalid. 

So i stopped talking about it with her and had to start tiptoeing around her! 

Then when she found out about that night with Tom she started going off saying I’m going to get myself killed (he had a past but is a good person and doing extremely well now) anyway she would start making comments about the parting I was doing - fair, it’s a bad path but I was still working and paying all my bills but yes i started hooking up with some people, some I’m not proud of but wasn’t hurting anyone, just a hook up, both being single 

She started at me with a theory her boyfriend has, claiming “if you hook up with more than seven people you won’t be able to feel love anymore” (my total body count as of now is 5) 

Anyway, it seemed like any decision I made was wrong. Yes, some of them probably weren’t smart but again I was on a healing journey and had to go through that phase to become who I am today. As I said it’s a small town so when I would go out, I would often run into Tom. Things with him got awkward and it seemed like he was trying to make me jealous with other girls, again I didn’t want a relationship with him, but I missed him as a friend so it kind of hurt the way he treated me and I confided that into my ex best friend. 

Fast forward a bit I was in a bad spot. I had no vehicle but had a new job and working towards getting a vehicle and a friend I had reconnected with had set me up with a friend of hers will call him Ben, Ben and I originally were supposed to just be a hook up, but started talking a lot and fell in love ❤️ 

But still one night I went out with my ex best friend and again Tom was there and completely ignoring me. I confided to her again how that still kind of burns as we were good friends at one point. 

Anyway, Ben and I started dating and I was always very open and honest with him about everything. He knew about the entire history with Tom and was OK and comfortable with it because we both trust each other. And Tom and I are more acquaintances now than anything. Everything is civil and friendly. Basically if we run into each other, we say hi but we don’t ever talk or hang out.

So now it had been about four months after I had left my ex Ben and I are now in a new relationship and I’m starting to do a lot better. My new job was going well. I was very happy in my relationship. I stopped partying so much and focussing on myself and things that make me happy. 

At this point, my ex best friend had blocked my ex-husband for talking to her about inappropriate things making her feel uncomfortable and sending her pictures of his new girlfriends and hook ups while they were sleeping, so yes, her and I would joke about him and some of the things he had done and we’d make other jokes with each other.  We both in the past have had very dark humour and always joked about weird things.

So yes, I would make jokes about her having ginger babies, and making ginger jokes obviously we would both laugh and this was a ongoing joke for YEARS, also my ex had been saying/ doing some wild things SHE would randomly tell me about so I would jokingly comment things like “oh my God I’ll spread a rumor I’m pregnant” or spread a rumour about me doing something crazy again obviously as a joke. 

Also to add throughout this time, I was pretty exhausted. My horse was sick with cancer having three horses at the time costed a lot of money so I was working a lot as a new staff often being the one to get stuck working 17 to 18 hour shifts on a regular basis. So I didn’t have a lot of time for myself let alone hanging out with many friends. While, also trying to keep up a new relationship.

Now to the long book of a message she sent me basically stating I am a horrible person for all the things I did after I left my husband, claiming I basically cheated on him because I had some kind of feelings for Tom (even though I left my ex once I understood those feelings). Also, she took all my jokes seriously I guess, even though for our entire friendship, we would both often make some crazy jokes, her included. And  because of my party phase she claimed it just wasn’t me and I had changed, even though she went through a COUPLE YEARS of a party face where she was doing some intense drugs, but me partying for a couple months is bad. also claiming that she has to call me out on these things and basically saying because I didn’t brutally call her out on those things. It’s my fault she was in that faze for so long. And then, stating since Tom was similar to her ex and by similar, I mean, both had a rough past, and both lived in the same area and had a similar genetic makeup me being friends with him and apparently hooking up with him means I’m entertaining a full relationship with him even though I was not, I am purposefully triggering her because of her abusive ex. And for the cherry on top of that message, she claimed I was ignoring her and not hanging out with her and not responding to her messages even though she’d only ever text me paragraphs and paragraphs of how absolutely amazing her boyfriend is and all the things he’s doing and buying for her, even through my divorce when I was clearly depressed and miserable, where most of those messages were sent while I was at work, so obviously I couldn’t sit there and read all of it and respond while I’m working and to be honest it was kind of exhausting, 

There was a lot more to the message as it was probably as long as the story and yes, I admit I did some bad things that I’m not happy with. other than my ex-husband I never set out to hurt anybody. I didn’t even sit out to hurt him but break ups hurt obviously. But her claiming I’m doing all of this to hurt everyone around me obviously kind of stung. 

So my response to her was that, obviously those jokes are jokes, I don’t want to actually do any of those things sometimes you just need to joke through the trauma. It was stuff that we’ve always joked about and she’s made way worse jokes in the past, and said that I’m going through a busy hard time and working a lot and I’m physically and mentally exhausted so yeah I can’t be on my phone all day every day reading all of her messages about her boyfriend and how amazing he is and also again I had never cheated on my ex-husband. I left him when I realized I could possibly have feelings for anybody but him, and I also added to that message that when I brought up that he practically SAed she sloughed it off, making it feel like it was my fault, and that was kind of messed up of her to do, and it hurt my feelings. Especially because I just needed to confide in somebody I trusted.

So because in my message, I said “ okay I’m sorry. I just won’t make jokes like that around you anymore” probably not the right tone to have, but I was hurt by the message.

Her response to that was another full book on how I am a narcissist and I’m just playing the victim card and that marital consent is a real thing and my ex basically had every right! So my response to that was “okay” and she said I was immature for that response 

That was the last time we spoke. about a month later I found out that her and my ex had become besties again and they all hang out so apparently the things he said and did are OK now, but the things I did are not, and she sent him screenshots of all the messages I had sent her confiding into her about personal things. So he went and started sending them around everywhere to a lot of people basically exposing all of my personal business to everyone. And she blocked me! —good 

Anyway I’m doing great now, my bf and I have been together a year in a super strong supportive relationship! I’m absolutely madly in love with him and we talk about everything and trust each other completely,  have distanced myself from all the toxic people that were in my life! And doing so much better and so excited for my future and that’s a feeling I never thought I have! 

Anyway this was my rant on how the hardest but most eye opening year of my life went! 

Anyway I’ve had a crazy life so if you want more lore let me know!!!

\*\*Heroic Mountain, Firecloud Temple\*\*

""Little Yao’er, your master’s time is almost up. Soon, I won't be able to protect you anymore. You've always had a big appetite, and I’m afraid you might starve once you climb down the mountain.""  

""I recall your Uncle Qingyun in the capital is doing fairly well. I've written this letter for you. When you find him, hand it to him. Out of our shared past, he’ll surely take care of you.""  

In the backyard of the Taoist temple, inside a small side room, an elderly Taoist priest with a pale face was speaking earnestly to a little girl in front of him.  

The old priest's voice was weak, and he could only speak in short, broken sentences due to his frailty.  

""No, Master! I don’t want you to die! I don’t want to!""  

The little girl, nicknamed ""Yao Yao,"" had tears streaming down her face. She was wearing an oversized, patched-up gray Taoist robe. Despite their poverty—so severe she only had five meals a day, sometimes entirely vegetarian—this old priest was the only family she had ever known.  

She couldn't bear the thought of losing him. Ever since she could remember, she had been by his side.  

As her round, chubby face began to collapse into sobs, large tears fell like beads of pearls.  

""Yao’er, don’t cry. Life and death are part of the cycle of nature. As cultivators, we should understand this better than anyone.""  

The old priest trembled as he reached out to wipe the little girl's tears. His voice was gentler than ever, perhaps because he knew his time was running out.  

From instructions on how to handle the temple to reminders for Yao’er to listen to her uncle once she found him, the priest left no detail unsaid. He even reminded her not to eat too much, as her large appetite might make others dislike her.  

Yao’er nodded obediently, pretending to agree to comfort him, but her little face clouded over when she heard this part. She muttered under her breath, ""Uncle probably isn’t doing that well in the capital if he can’t even afford five vegetarian meals.""  

The priest couldn’t know her thoughts. As he lay facing the heavens, a hint of fear flickered in his eyes—fear of facing his ancestors in the afterlife.  

The Firecloud sect had dwindled to almost nothing in his generation.  

With his eldest brother traveling the world, and his own end approaching, only Yao’er remained.  

He glanced at the small girl barely tall enough to reach the bed. Though her origins were unclear, her talent for Taoist arts was terrifyingly exceptional. Despite her young age, few ordinary cultivators could match her.  

When he first found her, he had been overjoyed, thinking that the heavens had sent him a disciple with unparalleled potential to revive the sect.  

But as he raised her, he realized her mischievous nature made her ill-suited for great responsibilities.  

Perhaps it was his lingering obsession. Holding her tiny hand, the priest gave his final instruction:  

""If you ever have the chance, remember to make the Firecloud sect flourish again. Should that day come, burn a paper offering for me so I can face our ancestors with pride.""  

""I promise!""  

Yao’er nodded firmly. Though she was too young to fully understand what ""revive the sect"" meant, she had heard her master repeat it so often that she roughly understood it to mean attracting many worshippers—and, in turn, more donations.  

""Good, good!""  

The old priest sighed in relief. With her promise, his obsession faded, and his vitality ebbed like a receding tide.  

""Master!""  

Yao’er called out softly, but this time, the priest didn’t reply with his usual warm smile.  

Tears welled up in her big, round eyes and began to fall, one by one, like shining pearls.  

\---

\*\*Two Days Later, Outside Firecloud Temple\*\*

After burying her master, Yao’er was ready to leave the mountain.  

She carried a small bundle filled with the dozen flatbreads her master had made before passing, along with a few basic utensils. The bundle bulged with its contents.  

Before leaving, Yao’er kowtowed three times to the ancestral tablets inside the temple.  

She didn’t close the temple gates because she had already taken all the valuables.  

The path down the mountain was unfamiliar. She had always followed her master before, but this time, she had to navigate on her own. After several wrong turns, she finally found her way.  

At last, she reached the foot of the mountain!  

Looking at the bustling road, Yao’er’s chubby face lit up with a rare smile.  

She had always heard visitors talk about how exciting life was down the mountain, and now, she could finally see it for herself. With no one to stop her, she was free to go anywhere.  

But first, she needed to find Uncle Qingyun.  

After all, her master’s flatbreads wouldn’t last more than a couple of days.  

She pulled a talisman from her bag and began calculating his location using his birth chart.  

This was a basic Taoist method for finding someone. Each person’s birth chart corresponded to celestial patterns, connecting their life line to their earthly existence.  

Despite her age, Yao’er’s skill in Taoist arts was unmatched, which is why her master had entrusted her to make this journey alone.  

She slapped the talisman onto herself and recited:  

""May mountains flatten and lands shrink. By the decree of the Nine Lords, hasten to obey!""  

A yellow glow enveloped her, and with a few quick steps, she crossed dozens of kilometers, arriving just outside the capital.  

She stopped short of entering, wary of startling people with her sudden appearance. The talisman dimmed slightly after the journey, and she carefully put it away.  

As she prepared to enter the city, a commotion erupted ahead.  

""Help! There’s been an accident—please save my wife!""  

A woman’s panicked voice cut through the noise, followed by the chaotic sounds of a crowd.  

\---

\*\*An Accident?\*\*  

Yao’er’s expression shifted as she stepped forward. Her small size allowed her to easily weave through the crowd.  

Soon, she reached the scene.  

The accident had occurred at a busy intersection, a common site for crashes. This time, two cars—one black and one white—had collided at a blind corner, leaving both vehicles’ fronts badly damaged.  

Near the white car, a well-dressed man with a bloodied head and a young woman were tending to an older woman in her forties.  

The older woman looked pale and was cradling a visibly injured ankle, likely fractured.  

Yao’er initially had no intention of getting involved.  

She turned to leave but froze when her nose caught a delicious scent. She had a weakness for good food and couldn’t resist investigating further.  

Her sharp eyes quickly locked onto the source: the injured older woman.  

""Madam, don’t worry. The ambulance is on its way,"" the young man reassured.  

Gān Xiǎoyíng was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.  

She had been shouting for help for a long time, and while the crowd around them grew larger, not a single person stepped forward to help. This made her even more panicked.  

If anything were to happen to her lady under her care, given the temperaments of the young masters and their father, she could kiss her life goodbye.  

The woman, however, was gentle-natured. Despite her pain, she comforted Gān Xiǎoyíng, “Xiǎoyíng, don’t panic. Keep your composure and don’t lose your head.”  

Before she could say another word, a small child walked over, holding a two-finger-wide tree branch.  

“Little girl, what are you...”  

The woman, bewildered, looked at the unusually vibrant and adorable little girl in front of her. The child crouched down and seriously examined her… leg?  

Having a household full of sons, the woman especially adored little girls. Though unsure of what the child intended to do, her gaze remained soft.  

But before she could finish her sentence, the little girl’s hands moved like lightning—so fast that she couldn’t even register what happened.  

A sharp, intense pain surged through her leg, and she let out a muffled groan.  

“Madam!” Gān Xiǎoyíng was horrified. She yelled, “Where did this wild child come from? Don’t you dare harm my lady!”  

This little girl had actually dared to touch the woman’s injury. Gān Xiǎoyíng accused her of malicious intent and reached out to push the child away.  

Unfortunately, she was too slow.  

Yāoyāo raised her hand, lightly hitting Gān Xiǎoyíng’s arm. “Smack!” With an audible sound, Gān Xiǎoyíng couldn’t withstand the force from such a tiny hand and fell flat on her backside.  

The male bodyguard, standing protectively nearby, immediately prepared to intervene.  

However, the injured woman quickly intervened. “Xiao Zhao, stand down!”  

“Yes, Madam.”  

Though Bodyguard Zhao didn’t understand why, as a bodyguard, he had to follow his employer’s orders unconditionally.  

The woman had stopped him not out of kindness but because she felt the sharp pain in her leg subside. Considering what had just happened, it wasn’t hard to deduce that her dislocated bone had been set back in place.  

But how was that possible?  

This little girl couldn’t be more than four years old. A child this young knowing how to set bones? No one would believe it!  

Yet, the facts spoke for themselves.  

The woman wanted to ask something, but Yāoyāo quickly finished securing her leg with the tree branch.  

In her crisp, childish voice, she said, “I’ve set your bone for now, but don’t move around too much until a doctor looks at it.”  

“Set my bone… just like that?”  

Gān Xiǎoyíng, who had just gotten up, froze upon hearing this.  

“Oh, thank you so much, little girl! I didn’t expect you to have such skill at such a young age.”  

The woman responded more quickly, smiling warmly as she prepared to pull out some money to thank her.  

But before she could do anything, Yāoyāo’s next words made her scalp tingle.  

“I only helped set the bone. Nothing much. But don’t thank me just yet—your troubles aren’t over.”  

“What… what do you mean?”  

The woman looked at Yāoyāo in confusion.  

Yāoyāo’s large, dark eyes were fixed on the thick shadow of yin energy shrouding the woman’s midsection.  

So fragrant!  

Yāoyāo unconsciously swallowed and then revealed two sharp little canine teeth as she spoke.  

“Because you’re about to die!”  

Her soft, milky voice delivered words that left the three adults present completely dumbfounded.  

\---  

“You… you’re spouting nonsense! My lady is blessed and destined for a long life. There’s no way she’ll… she’ll…”  

Gān Xiǎoyíng faltered, unable to utter the ominous word. She glared at the little girl like a hedgehog with its quills raised.  

“Don’t think that just because you’re a child, I won’t dare to teach you a lesson!”  

Yāoyāo ignored her and extended her chubby little hand, lightly touching the woman’s forehead.  

Although it was just a soft, small hand, the woman felt a chill shoot straight to her crown.  

“Your midsection is clouded, and your life star is obscured!”  

“The bridge of your nose bears a line—calamity has entered your health palace.”  

This tiny girl was babbling strange words like some kind of mystic.  

The woman, lost in her explanation, asked hesitantly, “Is there any significance to what you’re saying?”  

Yāoyāo didn’t respond immediately. Instead, her small finger shifted, touching the bridge of the woman’s nose.  

“The bridge of your nose represents strength, yet it’s marred by a break. Foul energy has drawn in misfortune. My master used to say, ‘Where there’s life, there’s luck; where there’s death, there’s foul energy.’”  

“You carry the foul energy of death. That’s why I said you’re going to die.”  

Yāoyāo tilted her little head, her tone sincere and serious. “But your spouse’s palace is intact, and your children’s palace is full—your fate is one of blessings and fortune.”  

“Darkness has overwhelmed light, which points to… possession by an evil spirit!”  

People’s destinies are typically set at birth and rarely undergo significant changes unless a major calamity occurs.  

One of Daoism’s five arts—Appearance—is about determining a person’s fate through their facial features, predicting fortune or disaster.  

An unofficial saying in the field is, “Disasters never come singly.”  

This means that when misfortune strikes, it often comes in waves. Individuals marked by ill fortune bring trouble not only to themselves but also to their spouses and children.  

But this woman was different—her fortune didn’t match that of someone plagued by misfortune.  

Adding the intense yin energy around her brows, Yāoyāo concluded it must be the work of a vengeful spirit!  

And vengeful spirits are delicious!  

Yāoyāo had initially been uninterested, but the prospect of this delicacy changed her mind.  

“You’re spouting nonsense! I’ve seen plenty of frauds, but you’re the youngest con artist yet!”  

Gān Xiǎoyíng, frustrated by the little girl’s cryptic chatter, was skeptical. Her words reminded her of shady fortune tellers claiming someone’s life was in grave danger.  

Still, the woman hesitated. Despite her doubts, she couldn’t ignore how this child had set her dislocated joint. This wasn’t something just anyone could do.  

Seeing the woman’s hesitation, Yāoyāo pulled a yellow talisman from her bag. With her chubby hands, she folded it into a triangle and placed it in the woman’s hand.  

“My master said that every meeting is fate. Take this talisman as my gift—it’ll protect you from one disaster.”  

“The talisman only works once. When it’s used, come find me, okay?”  

“I’ll be at… hmm… I’ll be at the overpass up ahead.”  

The overpass was the endpoint of her fate line, where she believed her uncle-master Qīngyún would be.  

Vengeful spirits are rare delicacies, so Yāoyāo took her instructions very seriously.  

“An overpass?”  

Was this really a scam?  

The woman tightened her grip on the talisman, inexplicably feeling that it might actually save her life.  

As for Yāoyāo’s claim of fate, the woman didn’t believe it. What she noticed instead was the way the little girl’s eyes sparkled as she looked at her—like a predator eyeing prey—and how she kept swallowing her saliva!  

Though the girl tried to hide it, her childish face betrayed her true thoughts.

I’ve had chronic reflux for about 10 years, and it got significantly worse after I developed what I suspect was SIBO around 4 years ago. Earlier this year, H. pylori was finally detected — not on stool tests (which were repeatedly negative), but on a biopsy taken during an endoscopy from a red, patchy area in my duodenum.

After completing triple antibiotic therapy, my stomach felt better than it had in years. I could tolerate coffee, spicy food, and things that normally triggered reflux with no issues at all. Unfortunately, about a month later, my symptoms gradually came back.

Since then, all stool tests have been negative again, and I’m now back on the waiting list for another endoscopy to see whether the H. pylori returned or if something else is going on (possibly gallbladder-related).

So while H. pylori treatment clearly helped, it doesn’t seem to be the whole picture for me. But then again, I'm not quite sure, perhaps it bounced back? All I know is, after the antibotics my stomach could tolerate like 3 cups of coffee without GERD symptoms. Sadly only lasted a month, but it's got me thinking, I wonder if it just doesn't show up in stool tests for some people...?

I am day 11 of no caffeine and it only took 75 hours after quitting to notice my hair had stopped coming out. (I could run my hand through my hair very lightly and sooo much would come out before I quit 😭). For the last few years (which coincides with when I started my current job and greatly increased my coffee consumption), I lost half the volume of my har. I had a thick, shiny, red haired mane, which was my pride and joy. Within two weeks of starting my job, my hair lost its luster. And was coming out constantly. I could see it trying to grow but I would even lose the baby hairs. Well, day 3 of no coffee, the hair loss stopped abruptly. My showers are no longer alarming, I’m not losing many handfuls of hair when I wash or brush it. The shiny luster is back, my face looks rosy again, hands are no longer dry, and my scalp is covered in a ton of baby hairs coming through my thinner (for me) hair (def not bald but have signs of male pattern baldness despite being a female). 

Two theories. 

Coffee was running my bowel movements. My food wasn’t staying in me long enough to deliver the nutrients my hair and skin and even nails needed. 

And second, I believe it was lowering my iron and other nutrient levels. Which also affects hair loss. 

My hair is coming back, skin is looking nice, and it’s dinner time and I still have to energy to make dinner and go to the gym later.

We had our anniversary last weekend and everything seemed very good. It felt like we were doing amazing. I am a very good communicator and always made sure to communicate challenges and check in— but he was always quiet in that regard and processed internally. Still, he’d reassure me that we were good always. This breakup caught me entirely off guard. I woke up one morning and went to the kitchen to make coffee and that’s when he did it. There were no warning signs but he said he knew for a few weeks. 

We moved in together last year and still have 5 months on our lease. He assured me that he’d continue paying for his half and that I’d have nothing to worry about financially. He left and ultimately his reasoning for breaking up was not seeing himself marrying me someday anymore and feeling like he didn’t know what he was going to do with his life. I feel angry and so incredibly sad. 

Is it possible for me to continue living here and be happy? Have any of you done that? I love this apartment a lot. And how do I possibly get over this? I know I will, but I feel so blindsided and in shock like this is all a horrible dream. ",1,1768784210.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Luma wasn’t supposed to be alive. She was stainless steel, dented near the base, and had a sticker that said *HYDRATE OR ELSE* in peeling blue letters. But sometime late one Tuesday night—right around the moment the fridge light flickered—Luma woke up.

At first, she thought waking up meant leaking.

But no. The cap was tight. The water inside her wasn’t sloshing randomly; it was… listening.

Luma could hear things now. The low hum of the fridge motor sounded like a lullaby. The ice cubes in the freezer cracked jokes when they thought no one was paying attention. The lonely lemon on the bottom drawer sighed dramatically every few hours.

Most importantly, Luma could feel when she was needed.

Every morning, the human would stumble into the kitchen, eyes half-open, hair doing something rebellious. Some days they reached for coffee first. On those days, Luma felt a dull heaviness settle inside her, like disappointment sinking to the bottom.

But on good days—*hydration days*—the human grabbed Luma and took a long drink.

And oh, that feeling.

It wasn’t just water leaving her. It was purpose.

Each sip carried a little energy, a little steadiness. Luma imagined herself whispering, *You’re doing great. You just forgot you were thirsty.*

One afternoon, the human forgot Luma at the park. She lay on a bench under the sun, growing warm, watching ants investigate her shadow. For the first time since she’d woken up, she felt afraid.

What if being useful was the only way to exist?

Hours later, the human came running back, breathless and apologetic, scooping Luma up like something precious.

“I can’t believe I left you,” they said.

Luma glowed inside—not literally, but if bottles could glow, she absolutely would have.

That night, back on the third shelf, Luma realized something important: she didn’t just hold water.

She held care. Habit. Second chances. The quiet reminder to keep going.

And every time the fridge light turned on, she stood a little straighter, ready to help again.

lol, hello fellow vermonters — i hope you're keeping warm this winter, & that you have plenty of maple syrup for your coffee! ❄️🍁

i am wondering if anyone is either looking to fill a room in their house, or renting out an apartment.

i've been trying to look for housing on craigslist but there are unfortunately so many AI scams on there now, & on zillow most of the places have a ~$50 fee to even apply, which i can't pay a thousand times just to not get the place...

i am flexible living pretty much wherever — i'm currently in central VT, but i grew up in Burli.

the housing market is just so competitive these days it's frustrating...& it's incredibly ableist too.

i am disabled, but i have money for rent, bills, security deposit, etc....but since i am disabled some of the places i've applied to won't rent to me because a lot of them say they require paystubs, & i am on SSI because of my physical disabilities & so i don't have a regular job.

many places also require proof of income *3x* higher than rent, & SSI does not pay 3x higher than rent literally anywhere in the state, but i have never had a problem using the majority of my monthly income on rent, & i never pay rent late.

please let me know if anyone is interested!! tysm ",0,1768783639.0,vermont,1,0.25,False

So, not sure if I shared my last story on here, where I gave a woman I found attractive my number, but she never reached out. I was just a little burnt out because I thought I read all the signs correctly, but I didn't. I felt so embarrassed for months after that. I didn't even bother making the first move again until 
Yesterday…..

I went to a coffee bar with my coworker, and once again I noticed there were so many beautiful ladies around that I ordered a cappuccino, sat down, and waited for it. My coworker is bi, so we were complementing the ladies there, but then I told my coworker how the lady next to us has the nasty bitch aura (good way, not disrespectful way) and how much I liked it. My coworker told me she wanted her hair. I told my coworker to say something, and she said no because she’s scared. 

I said fuck it, I’ll say something AND DID. 

So I said, “Excuse me, ma’am, your hair is so nice, and you're very pretty. I like your entire outfit; your entire aura is IT.” Then she said, ""Thank you,"" and started giving me compliments in return. Still, I could barely hear her since we were sitting at a distance on the couch, so I scooted closer to her to talk to her. 

That eye contact of hers was INTENSE!!!


She went on about how much she likes my hair and my outfit. Then she asked if I was an artist because I give off a creative vibe, and I said no, and was shocked by her compliment, since it was the first time I’d been asked. She asked where I was from and where I worked, vice versa. She revealed she’s a lawyer now, and she just received her license. I congratulated her, the barista called out our order, but we were still chatting, so my coworker had to distract us a bit to get our coffees. 
My coworker and I had to go back to our office space, but the young lady asked for our names, and I asked for hers. 

I told her I’ll be going to that exact coffee bar on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I said, ""I hope I see you again,"" and she said, ""I will."" 

Then she said her goodbyes. Then I asked my coworker for advice if I did enough or too much, then she said I did great. I hope to see her again, seriously. 


This time, how do I ask for her number if things go well with this stunning lady? It's since the last time I had a woman I was interested in that I've had my number instead. Like idk

I’m 50, single for about seven years, and ready to meet someone new. Finding a genuine connection has been tough for an introvert like me, and being dyslexic on online platforms adds another layer of difficulty, but I’m putting myself out there.

**A little about me:**

* **Basics & Vibe:** I'm a 50M, white, 5’9”, fit 155 lbs (HWP). I’m an early morning person and a laid-back non-smoker. [Here are my photos for reference](https://imgur.com/a/just-me-some-with-pup-aQREjJw)**.**
* **Personality:** I describe myself as **cooperative, empathetic, and trusting. I am also truthful, almost to a fault.** I am wholesome and emotionally available—traits I’ve worked hard to cultivate and value deeply in both myself and others.
* **The ""Engineer"" Quirks:** I’m the guy who will spend three hours researching the ""perfect"" toaster or garden hose because I just can't help but optimize everything I own. I also have a habit of laying out all the parts of a new item and seeing if I can assemble it correctly *before* I give in and look at the directions.
* **Engineering & Stability:** I hold an engineering degree and enjoy using my problem-solving skills to figure out how things work. I am well-established and stable with a steady job, my own house, and a car.
* **Lifestyle:** I value a healthy lifestyle, eating well most days and exercising when I can, though I definitely enjoy rich food now and again!
* **Hobbies & Interests:** I love gardening (especially growing hot peppers for my own spice blends), thrift shopping, swap meets, and relaxing in my hot tub.
   * **In the Kitchen:** I’m an avid cook and baker specializing in extra dark chocolate cheesecake, ""hot"" chocolate cake, and sweet potato bread.
   * **Simple Pleasures:** On weekend mornings, I love taking my dog to the dog park or Tempe Town Lake to walk around and socialize.
* **Pets:** I have a spoiled cat and a dog who are my world. Pet lovers are a must!
* **Media Tastes:** I enjoy investigative shows, sci-fi, and anime. I particularly love raunchy comedies like *Solar Opposites*, *Sex Education*, *The Venture Bros*, Adam Sandler movies, and *National Lampoon* classics.
* **Future Goals:** I want to get out in nature more, go camping, and travel. Longer-term, I plan to retire somewhere like a small town, rural area, or out in the country where it is warm and rarely dips below 40°F.

**The Real Talk:**  
I manage chronic pain through medications, treatments, and therapy. Fatigue can be a side effect, so I do have my ""Netflix and chill"" days, but I still get my stuff done and stay active. I drink alcohol very socially.

**A note on communication:** Because of my dyslexia, I tend to be a ""straight to the point"" writer—think of my future texts as helpful bullet points and facts! Because I value being 100% truthful, I’ll also share that I used a little AI help to organize my thoughts into this post so it’s clear and easy for you to read.

**What I’m looking for:**  
I am looking for a lady who is wholesome, empathetic, and emotionally available. I value a partner who is down-to-earth, loves animals, and enjoys the outdoors—someone who appreciates a cozy night in but also likes the occasional night out.

**First Date Ideas:**  
I prefer something low-key, like grabbing coffee and walking through a park or a farmers market. I’m also up for a round of mini-golf or a ""puppy playdate"" at the dog park!

**Call to Action:**  
What do you enjoy doing to relax or relieve stress? I find a lot of peace walking my dog or just watching him play. If any of this resonates with you, send me a message!",1,1768783324.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

My partner works Sunday evenings. I don’t. They tend to sleep until 15-30 minutes before they need to be at work. They’ve recently been asking if I can fill up their car with gas before they go to work on sundays because they don’t have time to get ready for work, get gas, and get to work on time. 

For a while, I was doing it because it wasn’t much of a bother for me. I would take their car and go to the gas station and get snacks or drinks or go to Dunkin and get a coffee. I would also sometimes take the car while they were asleep and get gas and go to the grocery store because I had to get groceries anyways. They also didn’t ask every week, just most.  I’ve also told them they should fill up before Sunday so it isn’t such a rush. Or wake up earlier. They said they would try. But I also didn’t mind doing it if I had a reason to go out. 

It snowed last night through today where we live. I had no plans to go out because I don’t like driving in the snow unless I truly have to. I went to the grocery store yesterday before the snow started and I stocked up on all my drinks and snacks so I wouldn’t have to drive in the snow. I was also still in my pajamas because I was looking forward to a comfy day inside. 

They asked me if I could fill their car up with gas again today. I said no, I don’t like driving in the snow especially in a car that’s not mine. They said it’s not far to the gas station and they had to get ready for work. I repeated that I don’t feel comfortable driving their car in the snow and I don’t need to go out for anything so I won’t do it. 

They were upset because I refused to go out and fill up the car with gas. They left for work upset and didn’t even say goodbye and later texted me that they couldn’t fully finish getting ready for work and were a few minutes late to work because they had to stop to get gas.

Things have mostly been really great, we get on really well, share values and outlooks, rarely fight, we've met each others families and friends and have had chats about what being together long term would look like. 

The problem is she has what i can only describe as 'toxic independence'. She flat out refuses help, or to be lent a hand, on anything. Even on small things such as drying the dishes if she's washing them, or offering to pick something up from the shop, she'll treat it like I think she's incapable of doing it herself, and will get angry about the suggestion. 

Even on bigger things that to me, it would be natural to ask friends or family to lend a hand, she refuses any help. She recently got a new rug for her place and single handedly moved all her furniture to get it down, including couch, coffee table etc.

It's hard to see how we would, for example, live together in the future and build a life together if she is so insistent on never getting help with anything and reacts so badly to the idea of it.

I have tried talking to her about it but treats any suggestion that she doesn't have to do everything single handedly basically as an insult.

I'm not sure where to go from here as it is becoming a real barrier to moving the relationship forward.

tl;dr: gf refuses any offer of help no matter how small, and reacts angrily to suggestion of lending a hand. Not sure how relationship can move on with such toxic independence.

DATE: —

TIME: —

PERSONNEL: —

INCIDENT SUMMARY: —

That’s how they trained us to think down here. Everything gets a header. Everything gets a number. Everything fits inside a box you can lock.

Even disasters.

But this isn’t a report. It’s a warning written with shaking hands under a bulb that can’t decide if it wants to live. If you’re holding this, you found it somewhere you shouldn’t be. Or you’re one of the people they send when a facility goes dark and stops answering calls.

Either way, you deserve to know what Facility Thule was, and why you should turn around and leave it buried.

Facility Thule is—was—an underground complex under Antarctic ice, roughly a mile down. The surface is almost nothing. A hangar. A few reinforced outbuildings. Steel doors that look like the entrance to a shipping yard.

No flags. No markings. Nothing you can photograph and post online.

The map they showed me on the way in was laughably vague: blank white space with a dot and a designation, like a weather station. That’s by design. They don’t want anyone to find it. And if anyone does, they don’t want them to come back.

I’m Dr. Mark Calloway. Microbiologist. Tenured once, then not. My last academic project died the slow death most of them do: funding pulled, equipment sold, students transferred, the rest drifting away. I went from writing grants to writing apology emails.

So when an unmarked envelope showed up with a contract that made my stomach flip, I didn’t do the smart thing. I didn’t ask why the NDA was thicker than the rest of the paperwork combined. I didn’t ask why the life insurance beneficiary line was already filled out in neat block letters.

I signed.

Getting to Thule felt like a test designed to see if you’d turn around.

South America first. A hotel that smelled like chlorine and old frying oil. A briefing in a windowless room where a man in a suit spoke like he’d never slept. Then a cargo plane that looked like it had been flying since the Cold War—riveted metal, tired engine noise, no logos.

We landed on ice so bright it hurt to look at. From there, a tracked vehicle carried me across a white nothing that never ended. The wind didn’t just blow—it pushed. It leaned into the vehicle hard enough to make the chassis groan.

The driver didn’t talk. He didn’t have to.

Then Thule rose on the horizon: a dark shape against endless white. Too straight-edged for a place that old. The surface buildings were squat and industrial, and they looked wrong sitting there—like someone had dropped machinery onto a holy site.

Inside the hangar, the air tasted like metal and old fuel. A short corridor led to an elevator. Not a little one. A freight elevator with thick doors, warning lights, and a keypad that required a code I didn’t have.

Victor Reyes—operations manager, crisp and efficient—typed it in without looking at me.

“Once those doors close,” he said, “you’re not stepping outside again until you’re cleared.”

The elevator descended for so long my ears popped in waves. The hum of the cables changed pitch as we passed through layers of ice and rock. The air got warmer. The feeling in my gut got worse.

When the doors opened, I got hit with that underground smell: filtered air, disinfectant, plastic, and something faintly hot like machinery that never rests.

Facility Thule wasn’t just a bunker. It was an artery system. Sterile hallways. Fluorescent lights that made everyone look slightly sick. Cameras in corners. Card readers on every door.

No windows. No time. Just shifts and scheduled meals and the constant, low presence of a reactor somewhere deep in the walls.

That first night they gathered us in a conference room with coffee that tasted burned twice. Seven of us.

Dr. Elena Sharpe: lead scientist, virologist, controlled and sharp, the kind of person who didn’t waste words because she assumed you’d waste them for her.

Dr. Aaron Lin: biochemist, always halfway into a joke even when you wished he’d stop.

Sarah Knox: systems tech, quiet, eyes always moving. She had the look of someone who’d spent her whole life fixing other people’s mistakes.

Captain Roger Blackwell: security, shoulders like a doorframe, voice like gravel, sidearm that never left his hip.

Dr. Alice Harlow: immunologist, exhausted in a way that didn’t come from hours; it came from caring too much.

Victor Reyes: ops, logistics, the man who could tell you exactly how many gallons of diesel were in a tank without checking.

And me.

They didn’t tell us everything that night. Not really. They gave us the kind of overview you give someone before you hand them the actual nightmare.

“Deep ice core,” Sharpe said, clicking to a slide that showed a cylinder of ancient ice and a grainy photo of something dark embedded inside. “Depth nearly two miles. Age estimates tens of millions of years. The sample within appears older than the surrounding strata, which implies displacement or—”

She paused like she didn’t want to say the next word.

“Anomaly.”

They called it Specimen Z-14.

Technically microbial. A smear of black glossy material, almost oily in appearance, extracted from the core and moved into high-containment.

The Red Room.

Even the name felt like a dare.

You didn’t walk into the Red Room casually. You went through three decon chambers. You scanned your eyes. You suited up. You breathed air that ran through filters designed to strip a room down to nothing.

When I first saw Z-14 under the microscope, it looked… wrong.

Not “alien” wrong in a fun way. Wrong like looking at something that should be dead and realizing it isn’t. Wrong like seeing mold on clean metal and feeling, deep in your gut, that it got there on purpose.

It didn’t respond to heat or cold. It didn’t behave under radiation the way it should have. It didn’t fit inside any taxonomy we had.

It just sat there.

Black. Glossy. Motionless.

And the longer you stared at it, the more it felt like you were being stared at back.

Weeks passed. In Antarctica, time doesn’t drift—it grinds. The outside world became a rumor we talked about in the break room like it was a place that might not exist anymore. The wind above us never stopped. Sometimes you could hear it through the ventilation system, distant and constant, like pressure against a coffin lid.

Inside, the work became the only way to keep from thinking about how buried we were.

We ran the tests we were allowed to run. Sequencing attempts. Chemical assays. Exposure to controlled stimuli. Nutrient substrates. We treated it like a stubborn organism that just needed the right environment.

Then Sarah called me over one shift like she was trying not to scream.

“Mark,” she said, voice thin with strain. “Look at this and tell me I’m losing it.”

Her monitor showed the microscope feed. Z-14 on a new agar substrate—nutrient-rich, trace minerals, the closest guess we could make at “home.”

At first glance it looked like the same smear.

Then I saw the pattern.

Not random spread. Not “colonies forming.” The cells were migrating in lines. In curves. In deliberate shapes.

Spirals. Hexagonal lattices. Branching structures that reminded me of roots, except roots don’t move like that.

“It’s organizing,” I said, and realized I’d been holding my breath.

“It started ten minutes ago,” Sarah whispered. “No changes. No new variables. It just… started.”

When Dr. Sharpe arrived, she didn’t gasp. She didn’t swear. She stared for a long moment, then got very quiet in a way that made my skin tighten.

“Replicate,” she said. “Multiple slides. Document everything. Time-lapse. No improvising.”

For the next few days, it did it again and again. Different shapes, same precision. One plate looked like a spiral galaxy. Another formed grids like mechanical teeth. Another built branching patterns that looked like nerves.

We told ourselves stories so we could keep functioning.

It’s a survival mechanism.

It’s a chemical response.

It’s a weird artifact of the substrate.

Then the patterns started repeating.

Small elements tucked inside bigger designs. The same cluster of lines reappearing under different conditions. The same spiral-within-spiral. Like it was building a vocabulary.

Sarah said it first, and the room went still when she did.

“It’s not random.”

We played the time-lapse for the full team in the conference room. The projector hummed. The footage ran: black matter shifting, aligning, building shapes like slow thought.

Sharpe paced.

Blackwell watched like he was watching a bomb disposal tutorial.

“It’s responding to environment,” Sharpe said. “Adaptive behavior is expected. But this level of organization…”

“It’s intelligent,” Sarah said flatly.

Blackwell’s expression didn’t change, but his jaw tightened. “Intelligent bacteria.”

I didn’t mean to speak. I did anyway.

“It’s communicating,” I said. “Or trying to.”

Harlow looked up, hands clasped too tight. “To who?”

That question sat in the room like a bad smell.

Sharpe proposed direct stimulus testing. Light. Sound. Electromagnetic fields. Chemical gradients. Carefully controlled, round-the-clock.

Z-14 reacted every time. Subtle pattern shifts. New alignments. It adjusted like it was learning the rules of the game.

That was when the first “tapping” happened.

It wasn’t in a dramatic moment. It wasn’t accompanied by alarms. It was so small I almost convinced myself it was nothing.

Late shift. Just me and Sarah in the Red Room, lights too bright, air too clean. Lin had left ten minutes earlier, still grinning like he was trying to keep the mood from collapsing. The hum of the filtration system was constant, a white noise blanket.

Then—tap.

A single, soft click from somewhere above us.

Sarah paused, fingers hovering over the keyboard. “Did you—”

Tap. Tap.

Two more, spaced evenly.

We both looked up at the ventilation grille in the ceiling. It didn’t move. No rattle, no vibration. Just those three precise sounds, like someone testing the metal with a fingernail.

“Probably expansion,” I said automatically, because that’s what you say when you need an answer that doesn’t make you feel stupid. “Temperature shift.”

Sarah didn’t answer. She stared at the vent for a long second, then forced herself to look back down at her monitor.

A minute passed. Then another.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Same spacing.

This time Sarah’s throat bobbed when she swallowed. “The HVAC doesn’t do that,” she whispered.

I didn’t say anything because I didn’t have a better lie.

The tapping stopped as soon as Reyes’ voice crackled over the comms asking for a status update. Like it had only been happening while we were alone.

We didn’t mention it in the log.

We should have.

Then, on the seventh day, Lin called over comms in a voice that didn’t sound like him.

“Red Room. Now. Please.”

We ran.

Lin was at the monitor, face pale, sweat at his hairline despite the climate control.

“It’s writing,” he said.

I almost told him not to be dramatic. Then I looked.

Across the substrate, Z-14 had formed a grid of symbols. Rows of shapes. Repeating elements. Structure.

Not letters. Not anything human.

But the intent was obvious.

“It’s a script,” Sarah breathed.

Sharpe’s hands tightened around her tablet. “If it’s attempting communication, it’s aware. Proceed carefully.”

Blackwell shifted his weight. “Or we lock it down and stop poking it.”

Sharpe’s eyes cut to him. “This is why we’re here.”

And because we’re humans and we always do this—we pushed.

We tried responding the simplest way we could. Sarah and I etched patterns into clean substrate with a sterile probe. Basic shapes. Symmetry. Repeats. A crude “hello” in geometry.

Nothing happened for a long minute.

Then Z-14 moved.

Not drift. Not spread. Movement with intent.

The black smear stretched and rearranged, cells migrating into a new shape that echoed what we’d etched. Not identical. But close enough to make my mouth go dry.

“It understands,” Sarah whispered, eyes bright in a way that wasn’t joy.

We kept going. More complex patterns. Longer sequences. And Z-14 answered every time.

After a day of it, we started seeing something like rules:

When we etched a single symbol, it replied with a single symbol.

When we etched two in a row, it replied with two—sometimes mirrored, sometimes altered, like it was correcting our grammar.

When we repeated a symbol three times, it responded with a new shape entirely, like it was telling us we were being redundant.

Lin started laughing at one point—thin, nervous laughter.

“It’s teaching us,” he said. “Or training us.”

Sharpe didn’t look away from the monitor. “We are not anthropomorphizing.”

But her voice sounded wrong. Too tight. Like she’d already done it in her head and hated herself for it.

Sarah and I simplified. We treated it like a child learning flashcards, because that was the closest model our brains could hold without cracking.

One triangle scratched into agar.

Z-14 replies with a shape that looked like a triangle, but it had a line through it.

We scratched the triangle again, and added the line.

Z-14 replied with the same symbol, then—slowly—built another beside it: a small dot placed directly under the triangle, like punctuation.

We stared at it.

“What’s the dot?” Sarah whispered.

I didn’t know. I should’ve stopped there.

Instead, I did what any idiot does when they think they’re on the edge of discovery.

I pointed to my chest through my suit, then etched the triangle-with-line.

Then I etched a simple line next to it.

ME.

Or what I meant as “me,” because my brain couldn’t do anything else.

Z-14 didn’t respond immediately.

Then the black cells moved carefully. Not fast. Careful. Like it was considering.

It built the triangle-with-line.

Then it built a second symbol beside it.

A circle.

Then, slowly, it arranged smaller marks around the circle until the shape looked unmistakably like an eye.

The dot beneath it appeared again.

Lin leaned closer to the monitor until Sharpe snapped at him to back off. His breath fogged inside his face shield.

“You see that?” he whispered. “It’s saying ‘I.’”

The eye symbol started showing up everywhere after that. At the end of sequences. At the beginning. Sometimes inside other patterns like a signature.

And once—once—after Sarah etched a simple question mark shape as a joke, Z-14 replied with the eye… and then formed a long branching line that split into seven, like fingers reaching.

Then it stopped.

Sarah’s voice went tiny. “Is that… us?”

Seven of us.

Seven branches.

I felt cold under my suit.

The facility started feeling different after that.

Not because of a dramatic event. Because of the small things.

People sleeping less.

Blackwell increasing patrols.

Sharpe staying in the Red Room longer than her own protocols allowed.

Sarah double-checking ventilation readings like she was waiting for them to blink.

And the tapping started again, here and there, always when you were alone.

Once in the break room vent at 03:12—three even taps that stopped the second Harlow walked in.

Once in the hallway outside the Red Room—tap, pause, tap—like it was practicing rhythm.

Once in my bunk, faint through the wall, steady enough that I found myself counting without meaning to.

By the time I realized I was listening for it, it had already taught me the worst lesson.

It knew how to get attention.

Then the glass shattered.

It wasn’t a delicate tinkling. It was a sharp crack like a gunshot, echoing off Red Room walls. For a second my brain tried to file it under “equipment mishap.”

Then I saw the containment chamber: fractured. Splintered. Black liquid blooming out from the break like spilled ink.

Only it didn’t spread like a spill.

It moved in tendrils. It reached. It climbed.

The sound wasn’t a hiss from escaping pressure.

It was wet.

Like something breathing through fluid.

Blackwell was already moving.

“OUT. NOW.”

Sarah froze, eyes locked on the black mass. I grabbed her arm hard enough to hurt and hauled her toward the door.

Sharpe hesitated—actually hesitated—clutching her tablet like it could save her. Blackwell slammed the emergency containment button. Steel shutters began to descend over the broken chamber.

The black mass surged upward before they could close.

It went into the ventilation grates.

I watched it thread itself through metal slats like it had practiced.

Sirens started. Red lights flashed. The whole facility shifted into emergency mode with a sound like a giant waking up.

Blackwell hit the intercom as we ran.

“This is Captain Blackwell. Red Room breach. Full lockdown. All personnel to designated safe zones.”

Sharpe yelled at him as we sprinted, voice sharp with fury and fear.

“You can’t shut us down! You don’t have—”

“Authority?” he snapped. “I have a sidearm and a pulse. That’s my authority right now.”

We reached the central hub where corridors split like branches. Lights flickered in an ugly strobe. Vents overhead clicked and rattled like they’d suddenly become too small.

Sarah stared up at them, whispering, “It’s in the vents.”

Harlow’s face went hard. “If it’s in the air system…”

A low hum started then. Not the facility’s normal electrical thrum. This was deeper. It vibrated through the walls and into my teeth.

It felt like standing too close to a subwoofer, except nobody was playing music.

It was just… there.

Like a heartbeat in the building.

Lin stumbled into the hub like he’d been shoved.

“I don’t feel right,” he said, and his words were thick.

Black veins were already crawling up his neck.

Not bruising. Veins. Like something had poured ink into his bloodstream and it was spreading.

He dropped to his knees.

“It’s… in me,” he whispered. “I can feel—”

He convulsed hard enough I heard joints pop.

Blackwell drew his weapon.

Sharpe stepped forward, reaching like she could physically stop biology. “No. We can—”

Lin gagged, and black liquid spilled out of his mouth in a slow rope. The same glossy black. The same wrong sheen.

Blackwell fired once.

The crack of the shot in that hallway was the loudest sound I’ve ever heard. Lin’s body jerked and then hit the floor like it had been unplugged.

Silence snapped in behind the sirens.

Sharpe stared at Blackwell like she wanted to tear his throat out.

“You didn’t have to kill him!”

Blackwell kept his gun up a second longer than necessary, then lowered it slowly. “He was already dead. It just hadn’t finished using him yet.”

Harlow didn’t scream. She made a small sound like something broke.

Sharpe’s eyes flashed. “I’m not abandoning this. If it’s intelligent—”

“It’s loose,” Blackwell said. “That’s how intelligent it is.”

Sharpe looked at all of us, then turned and walked back toward the Red Room, alone.

I still see her silhouette receding into flickering light, like she was walking into a mouth.

Blackwell motioned for me, Sarah, and Harlow.

“Operations. We shut down ventilation. We isolate sectors. We cut it off.”

Every corridor looked the same. Every light flicker made me think something was behind us. The air changed as we ran—warmer, wetter, like the facility was sweating.

We tried to isolate vents at a wall panel. Blackwell entered codes. The screen flashed red.

SYSTEM OVERRIDE. ACCESS DENIED.

Sarah’s hands hovered over the panel like she could coax it. “It’s locked us out,” she said. “It’s in the system.”

Blackwell swore. “Operations room. Now.”

Operations should’ve been the safest room. The nerve center.

When Blackwell kicked the door open, we walked into a room that was already infected.

Black tendrils lay across the ceiling in thick ropes. They pulsed. Slow. Steady.

“Work fast,” Blackwell said, dragging Sarah to the console. “Shut down vents.”

Sarah typed so hard her fingers clacked. Monitors jittered. Half the screens were static. The others showed camera feeds that were too dark and smeared to trust.

I stood at the door with a crowbar because it was the first thing I grabbed that felt real.

Then I heard it.

Wet footsteps.

Not running. Not fast. Just approaching. Like something that didn’t need urgency because it knew we couldn’t go anywhere.

Blackwell raised his weapon and stepped into the hall, flashlight cutting through the dark.

The beam hit the wall first—black sheen crawling, climbing.

Then it hit the shape moving inside the darkness.

It was Lin.

Or the shape of Lin with something else wearing him.

His skin was mottled. Veins black and thick. His eyes weren’t eyes anymore—just glossy black pools. His movements were wrong, jerky, like a puppet being yanked.

Harlow whispered, “Lin…” and took one step.

Blackwell barked, “STOP.”

Lin lunged.

Blackwell fired.

The impacts were real. Lin’s body jolted, but it didn’t go down. It slammed into Blackwell with a wet smack and drove him into the wall like he weighed nothing.

“RUN!” Blackwell shouted.

Sarah and Harlow hesitated. I grabbed them and dragged them toward the far exit.

“We can’t help him!” I yelled. “Finish the lockdown!”

Sarah was crying and typing at the same time. Harlow’s hands kept slipping off controls from shaking.

Then the lights died.

Total blackout.

Sparks flashed once—violent and bright—then darkness swallowed everything. The smell of burning circuitry hit hard, sharp and chemical.

In the dark, you could still hear Lin moving.

Wet dragging. Heavy.

Blackwell’s breathing stopped.

We stumbled into an emergency-lit corridor painted red like fresh meat.

Vents overhead had black tendrils pushing through like fingers.

“Freight elevator,” Sarah whispered.

“If power’s down, it won’t move,” Harlow snapped, but we ran anyway.

The panel was dead.

Harlow’s jaw clenched. “Aux generator. Engineering bay. Lower level.”

Sarah’s voice broke. “We can’t go back down.”

“We don’t have a choice,” I said.

Engineering looked like a place that had been alive and then died. Machines coated in black film. Floor slick. Air warm and heavy.

Harlow worked at the generator panel, overriding safety protocols manually.

“How long?” I asked.

“Ten minutes,” she said. “If it cooperates.”

Sarah and I watched the doorway.

Then we heard shuffling.

A figure stood in the doorway, framed by red emergency light. Human shape. Wrong posture. Head tilted too far.

Not Lin. Someone else.

Gray skin. Black veins. Mouth slightly open, glossy black visible inside.

Sarah tightened her grip on a wrench.

It lunged with sudden speed. Not running like a person—more like something being thrown.

I swung the crowbar and felt it connect with something too soft. The creature barely reacted. Sarah brought the wrench down on its head with a crack that turned my stomach.

It kept coming.

Harlow grabbed a fire extinguisher and blasted it into the creature’s face. White spray filled the air. The thing jerked, disoriented.

I drove the crowbar into its chest with both hands.

Resistance, then wet give.

It collapsed with a sound like air bubbling through fluid.

And I swear—just for a second—I saw black liquid pull back inside it like it didn’t want to spill. Like it was conserving itself.

Harlow slammed the final override.

The generator roared to life.

Lights surged overhead. The facility’s hum shifted, like it had taken a breath.

“GO!” I shouted.

Back to the elevator. The panel lit up like a miracle. Sarah hit the call button hard enough to hurt her hand.

Doors opened.

We piled in.

As they closed, black tendrils surged along the shaft, climbing fast, converging on the seams. Pressing. Testing.

The elevator rose with a groan.

I pressed my hand to the wall because my knees felt unreliable.

Sarah whispered, “It’s coming after us.”

And I believed her.

The elevator opened onto the surface level. Cold air slammed into us like punishment. The hangar doors were ahead.

Sarah’s voice was thin. “Plane. We get out.”

Harlow shook her head. “Not until we stop it.”

“We can’t,” Sarah snapped. “It can turn a person into—into that in minutes.”

Harlow’s eyes were bright. “If we leave, it spreads. That’s it. That’s the world.”

I stood between them, tasting cold air, hearing the hum still in the walls, and knowing neither choice was clean.

So we did the only thing that felt like control.

We decided to bury it.

Reactor overload.

Sarah went to prep the plane. Harlow and I went back down to the reactor.

On the way, we saw black sheen in the corners of the hallway, like mold that had learned patience. A thin tendril peeking from a vent grate, twitching once like it was tasting the air.

“It’s adapting faster,” Harlow said.

The reactor room was bathed in harsh red. Heat rolled off it in waves. The hum down here was so strong it made my stomach churn.

Harlow shoved her tablet into my hands. “Override sequence. Now. I’ll keep it off you.”

Her “weapon” was a flare gun.

I keyed commands with trembling fingers. The interface lagged. Error messages bloomed like infection. The system fought me like it didn’t want to die.

Behind me, Harlow fired a flare.

The room lit in violent orange. I heard wet recoil—something pulling back from heat.

Then the black tide surged in.

Not slithering. Surging. Tendrils moving with purpose, aiming for us like it knew where we were.

Harlow fired again. The tendrils learned quickly. Each time they pulled back less.

“HURRY!” she screamed.

My screen flashed:

SAFEGUARDS DISENGAGED.

OVERRIDE ACCEPTED.

I slammed the final command.

The reactor’s hum deepened. Temperature spiked. The air turned thick and dry.

“DONE!” I shouted.

We ran.

The corridors felt narrower. The lights flickered like they were blinking. The hum chased us, and behind it were wet sounds—movement—inside the walls.

We burst into the hangar.

The plane’s engines were already screaming. Sarah was in the cockpit, eyes wide, hands white-knuckled.

She waved us in like she was terrified we’d vanish before reaching the ramp.

We scrambled aboard. The ramp began closing.

I looked back through a small window and saw the facility’s interior lights flicker once—like a heartbeat skipping.

Then the ground ruptured.

Not a neat movie fireball. A violent white flash from below, followed by a shockwave that punched the plane hard enough to throw us off our feet. Snow and debris and dark smoke shot up into the Antarctic air.

The plane lurched. Sarah fought it, jaw clenched, muscles trembling.

For a moment I thought we’d crash. For a moment I thought Thule would take us with it.

Then the plane steadied.

We flew into white emptiness.

Sarah’s voice cracked over the engine noise. “Did it work?”

I didn’t answer right away, because I didn’t know what “work” meant anymore.

Did we destroy Thule? Yes.

Did we destroy Z-14?

Then something small happened that made my throat close.

A soft rattle above us—just a quick metallic chatter—like the ventilation grille in the cabin ceiling had shifted.

Sarah glanced up, then back to the controls, forcing her focus. “It’s just turbulence,” she said, but her voice sounded like she didn’t believe herself.

The rattle came again, lighter this time.

Three taps.

A pause.

Two taps.

I stared at the vent.

Condensation had begun forming around the metal edges—tiny beads, shimmering.

And inside those beads, the moisture wasn’t clear.

It had a faint, oily sheen.

Harlow leaned forward slowly, eyes locked on the vent like she was afraid blinking would make it disappear. “No,” she whispered. “No, no—”

Another series of taps.

Not a rattle. Not shaking.

Taps.

Like someone on the other side of thin metal, trying to get our attention without making noise.

Sarah’s breathing went shallow. She kept the plane steady, but her knuckles were so white they looked bloodless.

I swallowed hard and grabbed a pen from the clipboard by the jump seat. The stupidest, most human impulse. Like I could bargain with it using office supplies.

I pressed the pen tip to a scrap of paper and drew the simplest symbol we’d used.

Triangle-with-line.

ME.

I lifted the paper toward the vent like it could see it. Like it could understand. Like I wasn’t insane.

The tapping stopped.

For one long, awful second, the cabin was only engines and breath.

Then the tapping resumed—slow, deliberate.

One tap.

One tap.

One tap.

A pause.

Then a longer scrape, like something dragging along the inside of the duct.

A dark bead formed on the underside of the grille, hung there trembling, then fell onto the metal floor with a soft, wet tick.

It wasn’t water.

It was glossy black.

And as it spread, it didn’t spill outward like a liquid.

It pulled itself into a shape.

A circle.

Tiny marks around it.

An eye.

Sarah’s voice came out in a thin whisper, aimed at nobody. “We… we burned the facility.”

Harlow didn’t answer. She stared at that little eye on the floor like it was the only thing in the world.

The tapping came again, softer now, almost gentle.

Three taps.

A pause.

Three taps.

Like a child knocking.

Like something that had learned we respond when it asks the right way.

I thought about the first taps in the Red Room vent—three even clicks that stopped the second someone else spoke. I thought about how it always happened when you were alone.

It wasn’t practicing words.

It was practicing us.

Because it had learned the first rule of communication faster than any of us realized:

Get attention.

Hold it.

Teach them to answer.

I’m writing this now because I can’t keep it in my head anymore. Because if I don’t put it somewhere outside my skull, it feels like it’s going to press in until my thoughts aren’t mine.

I keep thinking about what Sharpe said early on—back when we were still pretending we were in control.

“This could change everything we know about life.”

Maybe she was right.

Maybe we did change everything.

Or maybe we just woke something up and gave it a door.

Because even as Thule collapsed behind us, even as the ice swallowed that place, Specimen Z-14 didn’t feel panicked.

It didn’t lash out like an animal.

It moved like something that had been learning us the whole time.

And now it knows what we look like.

It knows how we talk.

It knows how to knock.

And if you ever hear tapping in a vent where there shouldn’t be tapping—slow, deliberate, like someone practicing—don’t do what I did.

Don’t look.

Because once it knows you’ve noticed, it stops waiting.",1,1768782989.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

In the thirty-third year of Tianqi, during the coldest days of winter, a bitter wind howled.

At the Imperial City's State Preceptor's residence.

A mournful cry pierced the sky.

""Zhao Huai'an! Su Yue! You're not human!""

In a dark, damp firewood shed, a disheveled and battered woman, her clothes in tatters, lunged forward with all her might.

Her movements were too forceful, causing her slightly bulging abdomen to become more noticeable.

But before she could reach the door, the iron chains binding her yanked her back, forcing her to stop.

The chains clanked loudly as the woman, her collarbone pierced by the chains, ignored the pain and tried to move forward.

At the doorway, a man in luxurious robes looked on with disgust. Beside him, a beautiful woman clung to his side.

At their feet lay a lifeless body.

Su Li stared at the maid who, just moments ago, had whispered, ""Don't be afraid, Miss, I'll save you."" Now, the maid was dead.

Su Li's eyes burned with hatred as she glared at the couple.

""Brother An, Sister is so scary!"" The delicate woman pressed herself closer to the man.

The man wrapped his arm around her and comforted her, ""Don't be afraid, Yue'er. She can't get to us.""

He then turned to Su Li and said coldly, ""Su Li, hand over the military tally, and I'll make your death quick and painless!""

Su Li threw her head back and laughed. Her long hair fell away, revealing a long, hideous scar across her face.

Despite the scar, her eyes were stunningly beautiful.

""Zhao Huai'an, you owe everything you have today to my Su family! To me, Su Li! What 'Tianqi's top strategist'? Without me, Su Li, you're nothing!""

Zhao Huai'an gritted his teeth. This was exactly why this woman had to die!

He had risen from a penniless scholar to a trusted advisor of the emperor, and it was all thanks to this woman.

But precisely because she was so cunning, she had to die!

Now that the new emperor had ascended the throne, Zhao Huai'an had achieved everything he wanted. It was time for this woman to step aside.

""Sister, as women, we should always put our men first. Why be so strong-willed? Look where it's gotten you,"" Su Yue said, her words pleasing Zhao Huai'an but enraging Su Li.

Su Li rattled her chains, glaring at her once-beloved younger sister. ""Su Yue, you're utterly heartless! He was your father too! How could you do this? You're worse than an animal!""

Su Yue covered her mouth and giggled. ""Sister, it seems your maid told you everything. Your father and your maternal grandfather's family are already in the underworld. They died horribly, accused of treason.""

""You didn't see it, but your grandfather's blood flowed like a river, staining the execution ground red. His head was even hung on the city gate as a warning. Tsk tsk...""

Su Li's eyes turned bloodshot as she screamed, ""Jun Hui! You tyrant! Tyrant!!""

Seeing Su Li's reaction, Su Yue grew even more excited. ""Oh, and one more thing, Sister. I might as well tell you the truth. Even though I called that man 'father' for over a decade, he wasn't really my father! Besides, he never treated me like a daughter. His eyes were always on your dead mother and you, the little bastard!""

Su Li's eyes widened in disbelief. ""You viper! What do you mean? Father always treated us equally! He never favored me over you! Father lived a clean, honorable life, and you've tarnished his name! Are you even human?!""

Su Yue sneered. ""Never favored you? Then why didn't he make my mother his official wife after your mother died? Why did I always have to live in your shadow as the legitimate daughter? He brought this upon himself, and it's all because of you! The new emperor has ascended, and with a new ruler comes new officials. Your father and grandfather's family had to go. It's all your fault!""

Su Li took a step back.

Yes, it was her fault!

She had ignored her father's warnings and stubbornly married into the impoverished Zhao family.

She had strategized and schemed, helping her husband and aiding the new emperor's rise to power.

But when the rabbits are dead, the hounds are cooked. When the birds are gone, the bow is put away.

It was all because of her!

Seeing the despair on Su Li's face, Zhao Huai'an said impatiently, ""Yue'er, why waste your breath on her? Every moment I spend looking at her makes me sick.""

Su Li's eyes nearly burst with rage. Not long ago, this man had held her in his arms, swearing undying love.

Now, he treated her like garbage.

For him, she had defied her father for the first time.

For him, she had begged her grandfather to join the sixth prince, Jun Hui's faction.

And what had she gotten in return?

All her efforts for him had been worth less than a pretty face!

""Zhao Huai'an, I'm carrying your child! Aren't you afraid of divine retribution?""

Su Yue giggled. ""Sister, children are a dime a dozen. Brother An can have as many as he wants with me. That's no threat to him. Just hand over your grandfather's military tally, and you can die with less suffering.""

Su Li clenched her teeth. When her grandfather had given her the military tally, he had repeatedly warned her never to hand it over to anyone.

""Never! I'd rather die than give you the tally!""

If the military tally fell into their hands, the common people would suffer the horrors of war!

Zhao Huai'an rubbed his temples. ""Forget it. If you won't hand it over, then don't. It's just one less thing to please the new emperor. You can take that tally to the underworld and join your grandfather's family!""

Su Yue's face lit up with joy. ""Brother An, you go ahead. After all, Sister and I were once close. I'll see her off.""

Zhao Huai'an nodded and left the courtyard.

Once he was gone, Su Yue's sweet smile vanished. She turned to Su Li, her eyes filled with venom.

""Su Li, do you know what I hate most about you? It's your eyes. You're so ugly, yet you have such beautiful eyes. You don't deserve them! Yuqi, go gouge out her eyes!""

The maid behind her hesitated, her head bowed, not daring to look at Su Li.

Su Li stared at her.

""What? You don't want to? Do you still care for your former mistress?"" Su Yue said coldly.

Yuqi clenched her fists, then suddenly looked up at Su Li with newfound courage. ""Miss, I'm sorry!""

Su Li's hands were bound, her collarbone pierced. She couldn't fight back. She could only watch as her former maid approached.

""Ah—ah!!!""

A scream echoed through the snowy night, accompanied by Su Yue's sweet laughter, creating an eerie scene.

Su Li was on the verge of passing out from the pain, but her hatred kept her conscious.

""Hehehe, Sister, now you look much more... harmonious.""

""Sister, I actually feel a little sorry for you. You were brilliant for half your life, but also foolish for the other half. Do you know why I want you dead? Because you're in my way, just like your mother was in my mother's way. That's why my mother took her life!""

Su Li trembled.

Her mother hadn't died from complications after a miscarriage?

That was why she had devoted herself to studying medicine.

As if Su Li hadn't suffered enough, Su Yue continued, ""Oh, and do you know how your cousin died? She was raped to death by soldiers. It's so funny. You always ignored her, but even in her final moments, she begged me to spare you. Isn't that hilarious?""

Cousin...

""Pfft!""

Su Li could no longer hold back. She spat out a mouthful of blood and collapsed to the ground, vomiting blood uncontrollably.

Her body was soon drenched in blood.

""Zhao Huai'an! Su Yue! Jun Hui! I'll haunt you even in death!!""

With that final cry, Su Li's strength left her. She fell to the ground, lifeless.

Yuqi trembled as she stepped forward to check Su Li's breathing.

""Madam, she's... dead...""

Su Yue smiled sweetly and said gently, ""Throw her body to the dogs in the mass graves.""

Yuqi shivered and nodded. ""Yes!""

She called in two servants from outside to drag the body away.

The wind stopped, and the snow ceased.

""Master, this seems to be the granddaughter of the old Duke!""

The sound of a wheelchair rolling followed.

A sigh was heard.

Then, Su Li felt a warmth envelop her.

She could sense a heavy cloak being draped over her body.

""Cough cough... what a pitiful soul. Let's go.""

""Master... your cold ailment...""

Su Li struggled to open her eyes. Through her blurred vision, she saw the back of a man in a wheelchair.

In the snowy night, he looked especially pure.

Jun Mo, I'm sorry...

It was her scheme that had worsened this brilliant man's cold ailment, confining him to a wheelchair and stripping him of his chance to compete for the throne against Jun Hui.

The late emperor had four sons. The crown prince had died of illness, the third prince was a recluse, and the only threat to Jun Hui was the seventh prince, Jun Mo, who was both talented and beloved by the late emperor.

So, she had devised a poisonous plan.

How ironic that in her final moments, the one who showed her kindness was him.

Her fate was her own doing!

Jun Mo, if there's a next life, I'll repay you!

1qgpc09,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qgpc09/the_guy_making_my_coffee_just_blue_screened_when/,"The guy making my coffee just "":("" blue screened when I told him a joke.","It wasn’t even a funny joke. 

Just an awkward attempt at breaking the tension, while he made my coffee.

“There’s not enough foam in the world to satisfy me!” I said, hinting that he was putting way too much foam into my drink. 

He was cute. 

Just out of college and pretentious looking cute. I expected him to roll his eyes or completely ignore me. 

The guy's warm brown gaze found mine, eyes seeming to narrow, almost like he was trying to understand what I said. 

I watched him mull the joke in his brain, inclining his head. I thought he'd laugh. 

What I didn't expect, was for the joke to completely break him. 

""Hm?"" He smiled, and I noticed his smile wasn't really a smile, just his lips widening without any real emotion. ""I don't get it.""

Oh, boy.

""The foam,"" I said, trying to laugh at my own stupid joke. 

""You know, like, I meant that all the foam in the world wouldn't be able to satisfy me, because you were, you know..."" I pointed to my overflowing cup, which was more foam than coffee. ""Kind of going crazy with it.""

I could feel my cheeks starting to redden when his head tilted to the side, strands of light brown curls slipping from his cap. ""It's just a joke,"" I said hurriedly. 

""Sorry. It wasn't funny."" 

His lip curled. ""But I don't get it."" 

His response reminded of a confused kid, or a senile adult. 

""You don't have to!"" I said. ""Sorry. Ignore me."" 

The coffee guy nodded slowly as he made my coffee. 

I could tell he was still trying to wrap his head around it, using serious brain neurons to solve it like my joke was a puzzle. 

Who was this guy? 

Thank god I was the only customer. 

""It doesn't matter."" I said, and threw in another joke to hopefully make it better. 

I can't remember the exact joke, something related to coffee.

I expected at least a sympathy laugh from him. 

But instead, halfway through trying to wrap his head around that joke too, his mouth curling, eyes widening, his hands kind of froze, and I swore I saw him… jolt. 

It was noticeable, with the way his body suddenly jerked, like he had just suffered an electric shock. 

I opened my mouth to ask if he was okay, but then his fingers still grasped around the rim of my coffee cup clenched into a fist before coming apart, and it slipped from his hands. I jumped, but the guy didn't react to the coffee cup splintering on impact, scalding hot coffee searing his hands and pooling on the floor. 

For a moment, he was completely still, before something seemed to sever in his expression. 

His eyes flickered, jaw clenching, before all of him seemed to go… limp.

I don't think I can describe this as anything but a complete blue screen. 

If Iooked close enough, I swore I could see the "":("" flash up in his iris, dull blue light illuminating his pupil. 

I thought it was some kind of elaborate joke at first, before the guy blinked, his gaze found mine, eyes growing in almost childlike fright. ""What..."" He swallowed, his voice throaty and gruff. ""What day is it?"" 

The urgency in his expression threw me off. The way he reacted to the sun streaming through the windows, squinting, and then shading his eyes. 

""It's September ninth…""

I couldn't stop looking at the red welts on his fingers from the coffee– which he could not feel. There was no pain in his expression, only confusion and fear starting to build, before erupting. 

He blinked again, taking a step back. 

The way he moved was clumsy, like he was drunk. 

""I shouldn't be here."" his trembling hands went to his apron, trying and failing to tug it off. 

""Fuck!"" The boy's fingers struggled with the knot. 

""I… I shouldn't be here."" He staggered back, his hand tearing at his hair, muttering the same thing over and over again. I asked what he meant, and the guy, Taz, from his name tag, looked me directly in the eye. 

""I died last month!"" He hissed out in a whine, and shivers slowly crept their way down my spine when I noticed the ugly rugged stitches clumsily holding his brain inside his skull. ""It was a car crash. I was brain dead, and then I was talking to mom.""

""She died when I was a baby, and I thought I'd made it to her."" 

I caught frustrated tears in his eyes. 

""But my contract doesn't end until 2009, so I think..."" His expression twisted, and he ran a hand through his hair. ""I think they're keeping me here until it finishes."" 

Taz groaned. ""I knew their policy was fucked up, but this is a whole other level...""

His words were tightening my chest. 

""You're not making sense,"" I managed to choke out, ""What are you talking about?"" 

""I'm dead!"" He hissed out, like I was stupid. 

""I was in a car wreck with my friends last month.   I was in the back, and everything went dark. I was planning on quitting this stupid job, but I died before I could.""

His slightly hysterical eyes found mine. 

""Can you help me?"" Taz whimpered, his eyes lighting up. ""It's got to be 2009 at least, right? It feels like at least a year has gone by. They should let me go now."" 

His lips quirked. ""I can join mom.""

""Taz."" a voice from the back growled, and the boy stiffened up. ""Get back to work."" 

""Go fuck yourself,"" Taz spoke in a  breath, more to himself than his boss. 

""Dillon."" The man addressed him by his second name this time. ""What did I just say?"" 

Taz didn't reply. I caught his hand creeping across the counter, fingers wrapping around a splinter of broken coffee cup. I knew what he was going to do. 

I could sense it in the way the tendons in his wrists convulsed. He was going to slit his throat right in front of me. 

I watched him bring the splintered piece up to the flesh of his neck, and purposely stabbing it in. Not enough to draw blood, but enough to force himself to continue. 

The blade kept going, and I found myself paralysed. 

With no other customers, it was just me watching this. I waited for him to slice open his neck, and finally end it. 

But the guy wasn't moving, his fingers cinched around the blade. 

When it sliced through his skin, reddish black globules pooled down his fingers, sliding in thick rivulets, almost like jelly. 

""I said,"" The voice said in a grumble, and Taz's body jolted once again. 

Blood ran from his nose in a reddish paste, the stitches in his head springing apart, his whole body seeming to fall apart. 

I could see that his eyes weren't fully lodged into his skull, skin paper thin. 

This was not blood I was seeing--or it was, but it was ancient. This was supposed to come from a fucking corpse. 

The blade slipped from his fingers, and he straightened up, like his puppet strings were being violently tugged. 

The boss scoffed, and I saw the last slithers of desperation fade from the boy's eyes, replaced with an almost inhuman like glitter. ""Get back to work, Taz. I don't pay you to stand around talking.""

Taz looked confused for a moment, before he responded in a breath. ""Yes."" 

""Yes, what?"" The boss didn't reveal himself. 

""Yes, sir.""

Taz spoke with no hesitation. His arms fell to his sides once again, and that light was back in his eyes, a lot brighter, his lips stretching into a wide, vacant smile that only knew how to serve coffee. 

Already, I could feel myself moving back, knowing I was speaking to nothing but a suit of undead flesh without a soul, puppeteered by invisible strings. 

This boy's afterlife was *working*. 

I forgot about my coffee. 

I forgot about what I had been doing, that I had work to finish, and being late for afternoon class.

Because this guy was suddenly at the centre of my world, and I wanted to get him, and everyone else like him, out of there. 

But how could I do that? Realistically? 

""Would you like anything else?"" Taz handed me my coffee, and I took it, my hands trembling. He was too. His body was rejecting the light, lips trying to form words, a cry for help being shoved deep, deep down. 

I stepped back and turned away from him. And I kept walking until I was out of the door, back into the early fall breeze. I don't know what possessed me to turn around. Maybe I was hoping to catch a glimpse of 

Taz. 

Instead, my gaze found another employee. 

This time, a smiling brunette. 

When her eyes caught mine, she inclined her head, the sound of her neck snapping, sending shivers down my spine.

""Are you okay there?"" She spoke to me directly and I nodded shakily. 

When she turned around, I saw the bullet wound in her head, a cavernous hole that looked too fresh, like it was recent. 

I glimpsed splinters of bone sticking to her hair like cats teeth. 

I think she noticed, and shot me a smile, fixing her bright green hat over dark red curls. The boss came to the front, finally, a fifty something year old guy with a face full of wrinkles and too wide smile. 

His sweat stained shirt told me everything I needed to know. 

""Do you need anything else?"" It's like he was challenging me to question the state of his workers. 

""Expect the best from our favorite employee! Since 2006!"" 

The boss slapped Taz's shoulder, laughing heartily, and the boy didn't move. But I did see his head slightly dislodge from his neck, his body going limp once again. 

Taz's eyes briefly found me. But he didn't cry out for help, only smiling with his boss, joining in the fake laughing. When another customer came in, he waved cheerily. 

""Welcome!"" 

I left the place after that. 

But I can't stop thinking about it. 

If everyone in that place is dead, do they employ the dead? Or do their employees coincidentally die? 

Is there a way to save these people? Because what the FUCK did I just witness?",6,1768782894.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1qgpbrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1qgpbrn/contemplating_your_first_ev_some_things_to/,Contemplating your first EV? Some things to consider...,"This is a somewhat US-centric post, particularly with regards to charging.

I'm a happy EV owner and general EV advocate.  I was living in New England when I got my first EV, and have exhibited at a lot of EV shows, as part of a group of owners answering questions from potential buyers.  I'm now on the west coast, where EV knowledge and charger availability is much higher.

There's a \*lot\* of misinformation out there, and I see a lot of the same questions/concerns appearing in this subreddit.

I ask potential owners these questions:

* What is your daily drive like?
* Where do you like to go on road trips?
* Can you charge at home, work, or school?
* Do you plan to tow?
* Will the EV be your only vehicle?
* What is public charging like in your area?
* What is your climate like?

**Daily drive** \- how far, city/highway, any stop and go, how many times per week.

**Road trips** \- do you frequently go to a particular area that's far enough away that you'll need to charge?

**Home/work/school charging**.  Ideally, you'll want to charge at home.  It's less expensive and more convenient (unless you're lucky to have free charging at work).  Having to rely on public charging introduces pain; see the public charging section below.

**Towing** \- generally not a good idea!  50% range hit on average, towing any distance usually requires closely spaced public chargers.

**Only vehicle** \- if you also have an ICE or hybrid, you can more easily accept some of the EV limitations.

**Public charging**

* Broadly speaking, good on the West Coast, more difficult elsewhere.  For many years, the Tesla Supercharger and destination networks were the gold standard.  Tesla spent literally hundreds of millions of dollars developing this network, and it is not a profit center but a way to help them sell more cars.  They typically have a number of stalls and are repaired quickly if a problem arises.  Other networks have to be profit oriented, have fewer stalls, may have broken/slow chargers, and take longer to repair.
* Public chargers can be quite a bit more expensive than home charging - comparable to those remote gas stations that have a $1-$2 surcharge.
* Very few networks can display real-time, accurate charging stall availability.
* Older, free level 2 chargers, intended to help EV adoption, are almost completely gone now.
* Tesla opened up its Supercharger network recently.  As a Tesla owner, I don't like the added competition for stalls, but as a general EV advocate, I think it's a great idea.  Tesla uses a different (NACS) plug; most other brands use J1772/CCS, but some are converting to Tesla's NACS.  Not really a big issue as adapters are available in both directions.  Not all Tesla Superchargers accept other brands; older hardware can't handle it, and they're restricting some high-usage stations.
* Charging port location is non-standard.  Teslas all use the left rear location and had short charging cables; other brands using those chargers not only need an adapter but may also require two adjacent stalls so that the short cable can reach their port.  The latest Superchargers have longer cables.  Non-Teslas with slow max fast charging rates will need the stall for much longer; combined with taking two stalls, it really affects stall turnover.
* Many networks will introduce an ""idle fee"" - a charge if you leave it plugged in after charging completes.  Don't plug in then go shopping for a couple of hours!
* Corollary - don't occupy a public charging stall, especially level 2, if you're not even plugged in.  The ""EV only parking"" means active charging.
* Some chargers have load sharing - two or four adjacent stalls share a max charging power.  Tesla v2 175 kW superchargers share between the A/B stalls - 1A/1B, 2A/2B, etc.  Those in the know will grab every other stall; if you pull in to a shared stall next to another car, when other stalls are open, you may be politely taught about this ""feature"".  Other chargers, like the Tesla v3 and v4, may have site sharing - some max number of megawatts split between all of the (many) stalls.
* Chargers built using federal or state funds must be open to all brands.
* Until recently, chargers did not accept credit cards.  You need to open an account with each network, download their app, and pre-pay to that account, typically $10-$20.  It's like going to a gas station, can't use cash or credit, and have to have set up an app for each brand (Shell, BP, Mobil, etc.).  A few of the networks recently set up account sharing among themselves.

**Charging in general**: this requires a bit of a mindset change from gas cars.

* Charging speed is not linear - it's quickest when the battery is almost empty, and slows down as the battery fills up.  The last part, going from 80% to 100%, is particularly slow.
* Charging speed is affected by temperature.
* With a gas car, you typically fill up completely.  With the common Li-ion batteries, you generally stop at 80%, and only go to 100% if needed just before a trip.  You don't want to leave it for multiple days at 100%.
* On road trips requiring charging, minimum travel time is to let the battery drop to 10-15%, then charge enough (25-40%) to get to the next charger.  Multiple short charging sessions, with the battery low and therefore at its greatest charging speed, is faster than  fewer stops filling it up.
* Trips require a bit more planning, especially if you have a shorter range car and are in an area with fewer chargers.
* Some cars have relatively slow max fast charging rates - you'll need to spend much more time at level 3 chargers.  Bolt, Leaf, and Equinox are particularly slow.
* Rather than planning to charge, charge at planned rest stops - get out, stretch, use the restroom, grab a coffee or a snack.  Many fast chargers are at the edge of a shopping center parking lot, near the food court, and not far from the exit of a major highway.
* Home charging is probably a completely separate discussion.  Topics:
   * Plug-in vs. hardwired
   * 120V (level 1) vs 240V (level 2).  240V charging is commonly 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60A circuits, less commonly 80A.  Some vehicles can feed power back into the house, requiring special house wiring.
   * The actual charger is in your car, and the max level 2 and fast charging rates are determined by the car's hardware.  The thing everyone calls a charger - the thing on the wall with a plug - is technically an EVSE - Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment.
   * Note that EV charging is considered by the National Electric Code to be ""continuous duty"", meaning a load lasting three hours or more. Max current draw / charging rate is therefore restricted to 80% of the breaker rating.
   * Unless you have a giant battery and drive a lot everyday, there's really not a lot of difference between charging rates - just make sure you can charge to the desired level before you leave the next morning.  Doesn't really matter if it takes four hours or eight.  Many manufactures will have a table showing miles of range gained per hour of charging at each possible level 1 and level 2 charging speed.
   * Many electricians, even with lots of experience, don't know the proper way to install a charger.  You \*must\* torque down the connections at both the breaker and the outlet/charger.
   * If you plan on a plug-in, you must have a heavy-duty outlet.  This is for two reasons - number of insertions and load.  The typical $10 Home Depot / Lowe's NEMA 14-50 outlet that an electrician has used thousands of time for a stove has one insertion when new, then maybe an unplug/plug cycle ten or fifteen years later when you replace the stove.  If you plug in a mobile charger at night and then take it with you during the day, that's potentially hundreds of insertion cycles.  Any wear  causes resistance, which causes heat, which causes more resistance - that's the overheat / fire runaway loop.  The same for resistance from not torquing down the connections.
   * Load - charging an EV is like running your stove - both may have a 50A circuit, but the EV is like having all the burners on high, plus bake and broil, for hours on end.  Forums are full of pictures of burnt wiring and outlets.  Cheap outlets can't handle this.
   * You may have to ""commission"" the charger - during initial setup via its app, you'll have to set the max charge rate.  Out of the box, it usually defaults to a 60A circuit with 48A charge rate.  If your circuit is less, you'll have to dial it back.  Electricians may miss this step.  Ensure the rate is proper, even if your car's max rate is less - another EV may use it in the future.

**Range**:

* The old car ads say your mileage may vary.  With EV's a better saying is your mileage will always be worse :--)
* With Li-ion batteries, generally keep it between 10 and 80%.  That's 70% of rated range.
* Speed impacts EV range, perhaps more than ICE cars.  They're typically less streamlined.  Figure a 2-5% hit above 65 mph.  Much worse above 80.
* Cold weather.  20-40% hit.
   * Lights, wipers, heat, and defrost are all coming off the battery.  Older EVs have resistance heating, newer ones have a heat pump.  Resistance heating in cold weather is terrible.
   * Cold affects the battery chemistry.  It reduces both the capacity and the charge rate.  This affects range, and the reduced charge rate limits regen efficiency.
* Battery degradation.  Most of the hit is in the first year; it slows down after that.  There's not a ton of historical data yet; Tesla's battery warranty calls for replacement if it drops below 70% in eight years and 100k/150k or so miles - varies with year and model. (edit: corrected to 70%)

**Range needed**:

After looking at the above factors, and what you need for your driving habits, you should be able to get a rough idea of how much range you need.  Use this to eliminate models with less range; what's left are the cars to consider.

**Driving / ownership differences**:

* EVs are heavier than an ICE car of equivalent dimensions.  Handling is usually worse.
* Acceleration/torque - Powerful motors, and full torque at zero rpm, give much better acceleration.
* Much quieter ride!  Unless the fan is on high due to extreme cold/heat, cabin noise is just from the wind and tires.
* Controls / infotainment systems are often the manufacturers latest and best efforts.
* Regen / one pedal driving.  By feathering the accelerator, you can control the amount of regen braking and stop where you want.  I typically don't touch the brake pedal at all unless someone cuts me off.  AWD has double the regen compared to a single motor EV, making it easier to come to a stop at a specific point without using the brakes.
* As mentioned before, you don't fill completely up.
* With home charging, you ""top off the tank"" every night.  Don't worry too much about charging speed, as long as it's back to 80% by the time you leave in the morning.
* The federal permission to use HOV lanes with a single occupant recently ended.
* Road trips are doable, but require some planning.  Teslas integrate charging stops in their nav system, and can dynamically re-route based on real-time charging congestion.
* You want your car to precondition the battery (heat it up) before stopping at a Level 3 (DC Fast Charger) for optimum charging speed.  Ideally your car does this when you program a charging stop in the nav system.  May be a problem when you use 3rd party chargers.
* Your local gas station may not be able to handle a breakdown.
* Tire shops should be ok.
* You may need specialized collision repair.
* Maintenance differences - under costs.

**Costs**:

There's a lot of discussion, and some costs are hard to predict.  A lot depends on your local electricity and gas prices; best case is home charging - public chargers are expensive.

In a lot of places, an EV is cheaper to run with direct energy costs - electricity vs gas.

Maintenance is far less - there are no oil changes or tune-ups, and brake wear is almost non-existent, especially with AWD (which has better regen).

EVs seem to have a greater up-front depreciation because of the rapidly changing technology.

Repairs and insurance may be higher.

Check with your local utility company.  There may be discounted rates.  My local utility had a rebate to install a home charger, another rebate to help upgrade the panel, and an ongoing program for a discount if they can disable the charger during peak times, usually 5-8pm.  I can also opt-out during that shutdown if I really need to charge.

Federal new and used rebates just ended.  Some states still have rebates.

Gas prices include federal and state taxes.  Because the state taxes are normally used to fund roads and infrastructure, EVs don't contribute to that fund.  To rectify that, many states are just beginning to implementing EV taxes - some with a flat yearly tax, others wanting you to state your mileage and pay accordingly.  Some anti-EV politicians have tried to set the EV tax rate to the equivalent of an ICE car with very poor mileage - you'd have to buy a very large amount of gas to pay the same fees as the EV charge.  This is an area very much in flux.

In general, leasing a new car is a bad idea for private ownership.

* You're paying for depreciation plus a money factor.  The biggest depreciation is up front; you're always paying that.
* You may or may not be able to purchase at the end of the lease.
* Your buy-out price may not reflect the actual value at the end of the lease.  If it's more, buy it and then resell.  If less, walk away.
* If you finish the lease with fewer miles than contracted.
* You'll pay a fixed amount per mile if you exceed the contract amount.  This may be substantial.
* You have permanent car payments.
* You don't build any equity.
* But... you get a nicer car for the same payment.
* If your car crashes or is stolen, there's a gap between the normal steep depreciation as you drive it off the lot and the straight-line calculated depreciation.  You'll owe more than the car is worth.  Fix this with ""gap insurance"".
* Salesman will focus solely on the monthly payment.  Look at the ""cap cost"" - the capital acquisition cost.  That's effectively the price you would pay if it was the purchase.
* You can't customize it.
* You might be required to use only authorized collision repair shops and OEM repair parts.
* It's a big profit center for dealerships, along with dealer financing.  Check your local bank/credit union for loans and leases.  My credit union gave a discounted loan rate for EVs.
* Leasing may be a good idea for a (small) business - you can usually make the lease and operating costs a business deduction.  As always, check with your CPA.
* BUT....  Leasing an EV \*may\* be the exception to this rule, because of the rapid rate of change in EV development.  There's not as much history to be able to predict the residual value (buy-out price), and used EV prices have gone up and down compared to ICE cars over time.

**Sources of information**:

* Car dealers will probably try to steer you away from an EV.  There's not much profit in the sale, and the big dealer profit center is their service center.  EVs require very little service, so they'll steer you to ICE/hybrid.  They'll probably heavily push a lease for an EV - that's profit, too.
* The Electric Vehicle Association has a number of local chapters.  List: [https://www.myeva.org/chapter-list](https://www.myeva.org/chapter-list)  You don't have to own an EV to attend meetings, and they have lots of info sessions.  Many have a list of every EV currently produced, with specs, to help make neutral comparisons.
* National Drive Electric Month will have a list of EV shows near you.  Sponsored by Plug-in America, usually twice a year in April and September.  Shows are typically a combination of dealers and EV Association members displaying cars, answering questions, and offering test drives.  A great way to compare multiple models and brands, in one location, side by side.
* PlugShare and ChargeHub try to maintain comprehensive lists of all public (and some private) chargers.
* ABRP - A Better Route Planner - will help you plan your road trips.  You give it your EV with options, what types of adapters you have, and it will show optimized charging stops.

I hope this helps, and starts some interesting discussions.

1qgpajd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qgpajd,Help me with my awkward living room please!,"What are the problems with the current state?

* Feels sparse, especially the walls
* Can't figure out a furniture layout that doesn't feel awkward in at least 1 way.
   * I feel like the combination of a giant accent wall that's not perfectly centered with the seating area, a giant window that's not perfectly centered with the seating area, and then a staircase and an open kitchen as the 4 walls is just really throwing off my ability to know where to put furniture. There's just not a single normal wall in the place.
* I have no idea what to do with the gigantic 12 foot tall blank wall. It's painted gold so it's a great accent in terms of breaking up the white walls, but it clearly needs some stuff on it. I'm just overwhelmed because it's such a huge space to fill.
* I really like the china cabinet just as piece of furniture in general, but having it positioned where it is prevents me from framing the large window with drapes which feels problematic
   * Note: we are not in any way tied to the stuff *in* the china cabinet. That's just a bunch of random glassware and stuff a relative gave us. It's way too much and barely fits. Happy to get rid of a bunch of it and fill it more intentionally.
* I know we need more interesting light sources than just overhead light, but other than maybe a floor lamp in the only corner that exists I have no idea what to do

Desired vibe?

* Upscale and elegant and luxurious, but calm and inviting and more homey than it is now. A place to sit and talk.

What would I like to have as far as specific things in a redesign?

* I would love to incorporate a book shelf somewhere. We don't have a full library or anything, but we've got a dozen or so cook books we use regularly, plus I wouldn't mind using books as decor that we currently just have shoved into random boxes and cabinets  throughout the house. Probably a solid couple of medium shelves could be filled

Any specific design constraints?

* Overall not really. We're mot married to any of the furniture, although I would generally be supportive of trying to use what we have unless it's just too awkward to work.
   * And before you ask about this specifically, no, we're not married to the rug either. We know it's pretty bold.
* You might have noticed there's no TV, and that's intentional. We'd like the living room to be a place to sit and talk.
* Generally speaking we don't want to completely re-theme the space. The main colors should stay: dark grey, white, and gold, but there basically is no accent color or any other transitionary colors at all. My thought was maybe a sage green would like nice as an accent, but that's just a thought not a requirement. Happy to hear suggestions.

Other notes

* Before you ask about the lack of coffee table, we already have a coffee table and we love it, but it's going to be in storage for a while (another year or so at least) because we have a toddler and the coffee table we already own and love is a 200 pound marble top beast and if you're not already aware toddlers just LOVE tripping over the lip of rugs and falling face first right where your marble coffee table would otherwise be. If we hadn't proactively put it in storage our daughter would have no teeth left. We're willing to put a coffee table in there of some kind, but obviously we'd be looking for something with a soft top maybe more ottoman than coffee table.

Budget

nobody really talks about this so figured i’d ask if anyone else deals with this stuff

testing geo-locked APIs is annoying af

last month i was trying to build something with a payment API that only works in like 3 countries. i’m not in any of them lol

my options were either:

	

∙	spin up some AWS instance in that region (costs money, takes time to setup)

	

∙	or just… use a vpn and pretend i’m there

vpn was way easier for just testing things out. connected to a server in the UK, boom the API worked. same thing happened when i needed to test some location-based stuff

idk maybe i’m lazy but when you’re just prototyping and vibing, the vpn route is so much faster

AI tools getting blocked is the worst

this one’s obvious but if you travel at all or work from different places, some AI stuff just doesn’t work everywhere

i was in a different country for 2 weeks and couldn’t access claude at all. had to vpn back to the US just to keep working on my project. super annoying

also some friends in other regions literally can’t use certain models or features without jumping through hoops. vpn fixes that pretty quick

coffee shop coding paranoia.

look i know everyone says “use environment variables” and “don’t hardcode your keys” but let’s be real… when you’re rapidly testing stuff sometimes you take shortcuts.

when i’m at starbucks testing my app and there’s API keys in my requests, at least a vpn encrypts that traffic. is it perfect? no. but it’s better than nothing when you’re moving fast

downsides tho (being honest)

	

∙	it slows things down. every API call to claude or gpt takes a bit longer and that adds up when you’re iterating fast

	

∙	some services detect vpns and block you (netflix definitely knows, learned that the hard way lol)

	

∙	good ones cost money. free vpns are sketchy and slow as hell, not worth it

if you’re gonna get one

things that actually matter:

	

∙	servers in places you need (wherever your users are or wherever the APIs you’re testing require)

	

∙	fast speeds - anything under 100mbps is painful

	

∙	doesn’t mess with your setup - some vpns break docker or wsl or weird cloud stuff

	

∙	no logging (basic privacy stuff)

my actual opinion

most of the time? you probably don’t need one for regular vibe coding

but if you’re building stuff with region-specific things, or you travel, or you keep hitting geoblocks on AI tools, then yeah it’s actually useful

it won’t make your prompts better or fix your bugs though lmao

I'm coming from a popcorn popper and like City-Full City roasts. I am the only caffeine drinker in my house and like to experiment so small batches are fine. So thought to upgrade to an SR540, thinking the SR800 would be too much in terms of minimum batch size. Overall am having trouble adapting the guidelines from the manufacturer, Sweet Maria's, and reddit.

Specific questions:  
\* How much coffee to load? Manufacturer says 85 gm for dry; 113 gm for wet processed. Sweet Maria's says 130 gm. I find lower batches give me more consistency.

\* What fan/power settings do folks start and end with? Sweet Maria's suggests to go high on power fast but I found the ROR made me shoot pass first crack into second way too fast and that charred my roast. Have been backing off since. Meanwhile following the manufacturer suggested made me only get to FC at 9.5 min. Guessing somewhere in the middle is what I need but not sure how to go.

\* For cooling, the cool function on the SR540 seems to continue the cooking - temp subjectively doesn't come down as fast. Do folks use that function or just immediately pour out onto a tray (which is what I did with my popcorn popper)?

\* Specific to the beans: With the Sweet Maria's Liquid Amber blend right after first crack I notice an off putting smell comes, like ammonia. Is this something that happens with monsooned beans? Am I doing something wrong or is this batch of greens off? I don't think I'm getting through 2nd crack into French/charcoal or anything like that.

""The subject from the reference image is laying back on her bed with her back comfortably resting against the backboard of the bed. Her upper body is slightly reclined, supported by pillows and the headboard. She stretches both arms forward toward the camera, making a Rock n Roll sign with both hands. She is wearing a vibrant blue tank top and light pink tights. Her legs are visible on the bed in front of her, one knee bent while the other leg is extended straight. She has a happy, exuberant expression on her face, her mouth open, showing her teeth and tongue, with prominent vampire fangs clearly visible.

Intense, dramatic golden hour sunlight bathes the subject from above and slightly to the side, creating strong, warm, directional lighting that pours across her face, hair, and upper body. Luminous highlights catch in her hair and along her facial features, while subtle, defined shadows enhance emotional depth and facial definition. Her skin tones are beautifully illuminated with warm, glowing light.

Professional cinematic color grading: rich warm color palette with enhanced saturation in skin tones, deep golds and warm ambers in the lighting, and subtle desaturation of the background elements of the bedroom and backboard to keep the focus sharply on the subject. Cinematic quality, 4K resolution, premium professional photography lighting, sharp focus on the subject’s face and hands with shallow depth of field, film-like color science, dramatic and emotionally compelling, ultra high resolution detail, photorealistic.""",2,1768781739.0,AiGeminiPhotoPrompts,1,1.0,False

I (gay M, mid-20s) confessed romantic feelings to my close friend of 7 years (M, identifies as straight). We've been friends since high school but got significantly closer in our 20s.

**Background:** About 6 months ago he went through a difficult breakup (his ex emotionally cheated). He leaned on me heavily for support and we started spending tons of one-on-one time together - regular hangouts that felt like dates (dinners, movies, hikes, he even invited me to a Halloween clubbing scene and his house where it was just us two).

**The confusing part:** The physical and emotional intimacy felt like more than friendship:

* He'd initiate physical touch (touching my face during a conversation on a hike, repositioning to sit closer at cafes so our knees touched, asking permission before taking his shirt off around me and staying shirtless for 30 minutes next time at his house with just us)
* I stayed over at his place multiple times - he'd make me breakfast, once stood over me in the morning and said ""it's good to see you"" while smiling and staring at my eyes and while i was sitting down on the couch looking up at him, then immediately seemed to regret saying it
* He asked me specific questions about my experiences on dating apps (Grindr)
* During one hangout he pointed at a couple and joked ""that could be us"" then quickly added ""but I don't think I'm gay bro""

After months of this, I caught real feelings and confessed over text (gave him an out by saying ""you're straight so I know this won't go anywhere""). A week later we had a phone call where he said he doesn't have those feelings for me and values our friendship. Since then (about 3 weeks) things have been awkward - he hasn't really reached out.

My therapist validated that his behavior was confusing and suggested he might be dealing with his own questioning/closeted feelings, but I emphasized I can't wait around for him to figure that out. She suggested having a coffee to discuss boundaries and see if friendship is salvageable.

Part of me wants to try because of our history and friend group overlap. But I'm terrified of getting breadcrumbed with mixed signals again.

**So...**

* Is it worth having this conversation or should I just maintain distance?
* For those who've been through similar - did the friendship ever recover?
* Am I reading too much into his behavior or were those legitimate mixed signals?",2,1768781505.0,FriendshipAdvice,3,1.0,False

1qgoriy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qgoriy/me_m20_getting_mixed_signals_after_studying/,"Me (m20) getting mixed signals after studying together with a girl (f19), how do I move forward without overstepping?","I met a girl at uni earlier this year and we’ve been studying together for a few months. We get along well in person she’s different from my usual friends, and when we’re together she opens up about personal things, which made me feel like there might be something there.

For context, she was actually the one who first talked to me. We sat next to each other in a lab, she asked me for help, and the following week she came and sat next to me again on her own. After working on the lab sheets together, she suggested that we study together outside of class, which we then did regularly.

The confusing part is communication outside of studying. She’s very inconsistent over text. We planned to go for coffee twice:

\-The first time, she cancelled with a legitimate reason.

\-The second time, I messaged her on the day to confirm and was left on delivered.

She has mentioned before that she sometimes doesn’t see messages, and a few times I brought up things I’d texted her and it seemed like it was the first time she’d heard them. That said, it’s hard not to wonder whether I’m being ignored.

We don’t have any more classes together now, so studying isn’t really an excuse to see each other anymore. The only time we’ve ever spoken on the phone was a few days ago, when she called me to talk about the exam. She’s also sent voice messages in the past, but always related to studying.

I’ll be away for a few days and was considering calling her after I get back to ask her to hang out and get clarity, but I’m anxious about calling and don’t want to make things awkward or pushy if the lack of replies is already an answer.

Some background that might matter: I was bullied growing up for a speech impairment, and this is the first time I’ve tried to get closer to a girl, so I’m aware I might be overthinking things.

What I’m looking for advice on:

Given that she initiated studying together and opens up in person but is inconsistent over messages, what’s the most respectful way to move forward reaching out once more (possibly by calling), or stepping back and letting it go?

TL;DR:

M20, F19 met at uni, she initiated studying together and opens up in person, but is inconsistent over texts and left me on delivered when trying to plan coffee. No more classes together. Unsure whether to reach out once more for clarity or let it fade.",1,1768781419.0,relationship_advice,13,1.0,False

A bit about me I love cooking and baking (and wish to do the latter more this year) I enjoy making Italian food and American food the most.  
I love reading, fantasy being my favourite genre (David Gemmel, Raymond E. Feist, Brandon Sanderson, Charles de lint) and horror following close behind (Stephen King, Joe Hill, Dean Koontz) I also read manga every now and then always happy for recommendations.  
Always keen for Anime/ TV/ Film chats with people.   
Other hobbies are Building Lego (mostly botanical sets), Gunpla building, Woodworking and furniture restoration.  
I used to game but don't get much enjoyment from it anymore so it's not something I am looking to do at this time.

1qgooeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qgooeb/mf_the_man_everyone_needed_to_believe_in/,[MF] The Man Everyone Needed to Believe In,"They called him Mercy.

Not because he had earned it —  
but because they needed it to be true.

Not his real name, of course.  
He had gone by other names before.  
He had been other men before.

But when a man comes back from prison with language like *recovery*, like *growth*, like *I’ve done the work*, people who need hope will build altars out of him.

He didn’t ask them to.

He never had to.

People want to believe beautiful stories.

Mercy told beautiful stories.

He told them in bars, in rehab meetings, in soft-lit art spaces with exposed brick walls and community grants taped invisibly to the ceiling.

He talked about the dark places he’d been.  
He talked about the demon bargain he almost made.  
He talked about the ritual magic he used to chase love like power.  
He talked about sex like it was a kind of prayer  
and women like they were cathedral doors  
that opened to let him get better.

He talked with the candor of a confessional  
and the charm of a wolf who had learned to smile.

He was never ashamed in the right places.

That’s what made him convincing.

Shame would imply responsibility.

Mercy preferred redemption narratives that never required repair.

Communities built on kindness are the easiest to con.

That’s not cynicism.  
That’s architecture.

People who believe in healing  
want healing to be real so badly  
that sometimes  
they forget healing isn’t magic.

It’s debt.  
It’s blood and work and humility.  
It’s showing up to people who were hurt and saying:

“I did this.  
I will listen.  
I will not require you to love me afterward.”

Mercy skipped the hard verbs.

He moved in.

He was given keys.  
He was given microphones.  
He was given rooms full of people  
who bent their heads softly toward him  
when he spoke.

He even worked with women who’d been broken by men like him.

And the town applauded  
like watching him speak healing words  
was the same thing  
as him never having been a knife.

Mort came because the numbers didn’t add up.

It wasn’t Mercy that lit the cosmic alarm.

It was the people around him.

Too many fogged souls.  
Too many half-closed hearts.  
Too many women whose stories tilted —  
not invalidated  
not erased  
just gently, firmly redirected into forgiveness they didn’t choose.

The universe tolerates cruelty longer than it tolerates fraud.

Fraud breaks the rules of motion.

It tells suffering:  
“Stop moving.  
You don’t get to decide how this story ends.”

That’s when Mort gets called.

He found Mercy reading poetry in a hall someone else had paid for.

People cried.

People held hands.

Mercy described making a pact with darkness  
like it was a romantic anecdote.  
People laughed because it sounded like theater,  
and because laughing forgives pre-emptively.

Mort watched.

Not Mercy.

The room.

He saw women smiling politely with their hands in their laps.

He saw a girl pretending not to shrink when he walked past her row.

He saw love  
doing the ugliest thing love can do:

protecting the wrong thing.

He didn’t stop the event.

He waited.

When Mercy left the building  
to stand under the mural painted in his honor,  
Mort joined him.

Mercy saw him and smiled like a man used to admiration.

“Brother,” he said warmly. “Are you here to hear the good news or share it?”

Mort didn’t answer.

He watched the mural:  
Mercy painted like a saint.  
Hands open.  
Eyes upward.  
Benevolent.

Paint forgives easier than people do.

Mort finally asked,  
quiet as winter:

“Who have you actually apologized to?”

Mercy grinned.

“I’ve apologized to the universe,” he said. “That counts for everyone.”

“No,” Mort said gently. “It doesn’t.”

Mercy’s smile tightened just a fraction.

“I’m doing good now,” he said. “I’m helping people. I’m proof healing is real.”

Mort nodded.

“You are proof that performing healing pays very well.”

Mercy’s eyes cooled.

“People need me,” he said simply.

Mort didn’t argue.

Predators always think they are necessary.

He found the woman later.  
Not *The Woman*;  
not the only one.

There’s never only one.

She didn’t tell him everything.  
She didn’t have to.

She said she got messages she never asked for.  
She said she was told to be flattered.  
She said when she withdrew,  
she was called ungrateful.

She said she was told he had suffered enough,  
that she should “practice compassion.”

She said forgiveness didn’t feel like a gift.  
It felt like pressure applied gently to her throat.

Mort listened.

He did not write anything down.

He didn’t ask her to forgive him.

He didn’t ask her for evidence.

He just let her tell the truth,  
and watched the air around her  
move again.

Sometimes the kindest thing you can do for someone  
is agree, silently,  
that what hurt them  
did.

The thing living around Mercy  
wasn’t inside him.

That would have made this easier.

It hovered above him like a halo made of debt.  
A shimmering thing made entirely of borrowed belief.  
Power from applause.  
Power from hope.  
Power from people who wanted to heal so badly  
they outsourced their courage to a man who spoke confidently about demons.

Mort had seen worse entities.

He had rarely seen a more popular one.

He stood beneath the halo  
and spoke like a clerk tired of being polite.

“He doesn’t get to keep what doesn’t belong to him,” Mort said quietly.

The halo pulsed,  
confused.

Mort continued.

“The forgiveness he didn’t earn?  
The absolution he never asked properly for?  
The wholeness he convinced people they owed him?”

He looked at the sky.

“I need it back.”

Cosmic things rarely speak.

This one screamed.

Bright civility peeled back like paper soaked through with rain.  
Everything Mercy had stolen without admitting to stealing  
came loose.

Not to punish him.

Just to return balance.

Women felt anger again.  
Men who adored him started to wonder why.  
A mural that had looked holy  
now just looked like a man.

Mercy staggered  
like a drunk whose charisma had been poured out onto the floor.

He laughed weakly when the room no longer adored him by default.

“Why are you doing this?” he croaked.

Mort looked almost kind.

“Because forgiveness is not your right,” he said softly.  
“It is not a currency.  
You do not get to take it without being invited.”

Mercy snarled.

“You’re destroying the work I’ve done!”

Mort shook his head.

“I’m letting reality exist again.”

The town did not burst into righteous violence.

That would have been easy.

Instead,  
something far more terrifying happened.

People had to think again.

Women decided what they actually felt.

Some left the room.  
Some confronted him.  
Some did neither.

Some forgave him —  
and this time  
it counted  
because no one told them to.

Some never would.

He had to live with that.

Which meant he had to live with something real  
for the first time in years.

Later,  
Mort sat on a curb.

Someone walked by  
and, out of reflex,  
offered him coffee.

He held it.

He didn’t drink.

Janelle appeared beside him like gravity.

She already knew.  
She watched the town adjusting to having feelings again.

“Did you break him?” she asked.

Mort shook his head.

“No,” he said. “I broke the shelter he hid in.”

She nodded slowly.

They sat in the new weather,  
listening to a man realizing he wasn’t adored anymore  
and women remembering that their boundaries were not cruelty.

Janelle finally exhaled.

“Forcing someone to forgive,” she said quietly,  
“is a kind of assault.”

Mort nodded.

“Yes,” he said.

They didn’t feel triumphant.

They felt like they had torn gauze off a wound  
that wasn’t done bleeding yet.

Sometimes that is justice.

Sometimes that is mercy.

Sometimes those are the same word  
and sometimes they never will be.

The town breathed.

And somewhere,  
far off,

[Part 1],"Back in the day, in my small town, there was a lot of talk and speculation about a website called deadlinks.com. The weird thing about this site was that you couldn’t access it directly.  Typing the URL into a browser wouldn’t lead you anywhere—no error message, no loading screen, just nothing. The only way in was through a dead link.

Some broken hyperlink buried in an old forum, a forgotten webpage, or an expired ad that shouldn’t have worked. Click the wrong thing at the wrong time, and suddenly, you’d find yourself there. The site itself was empty. Just a black background, with a blank text box, and a single question written beneath it:

“*What is your name?*”

When I was in middle school, kids speculated about what happened if you put your name in. Some said you’d be cursed and die in seven days. Others swore it was some kind of alien signal, or a government experiment watching you through the screen. All the “theories” were just bits and pieces stolen from horror movies. Other kids bragged about not being scared, claiming they’d do it. But the next day, they always had excuses. ""My WiFi went out"" or ""my computer froze."" Every time, something stopped them.

I don’t remember if anyone actually put their name in. But if they did, I never heard about it. Like many urban legends, the site faded into obscurity, slowly leaving people’s memories. A relic of an older internet—forgotten, lost, left to collect malware.

*discord ping*

SleepyBoi420 (Derek): Hey, you guys remember that weird website kids would talk about back in middle school?

OopsAllParanoia (Me): That was like 10 years ago bro.

404HumorNotFound (Ryan): yeah there were hundreds of websites talked about back then 

SleepyBoi420: DEADLINKS GUYS!! Remember the one you had to be redirected to!

OopsAllParanoia: Ohhhh yeah, the one that asked your name right?

404HumorNotFound: what about it Derek?

SleepyBoi420: I got to the site!

404HumorNotFound: oh no

OopsAllParanoia: Ok… and?

SleepyBoi420: This is the url I used, [autoinsurancepolicies.com](http://autoinsurancepolicies.com), you guys pull up the site too

404HumorNotFound: are you drunk?

SleepyBoi420: What’s up Ryan? You scared? Awwww Cryan’s a wittle baby 

OopsAllParanoia: lmao

404HumorNotFound: shut up dude! we don’t know what’s up with this site. what if it’s some kind of weird scam site?

OopsAllParanoia: Bro it’s just some dumb site from when we were kids.

SleepyBoi420: 404BallsNotFound

404HumorNotFound: you’re a dumbass...

OopsAllParanoia: Just put your first name bro. How many Ryans are out there?

404HumorNotFound: i guess…

SleepyBoi420: Let’s goooooo! 

SleepyBoi420: Ok, let’s all hop on a call and do it at the same time

""Okay! You guys ready?!"" Derek said with enough excitement for all of us. ""I'm good to go,"" I said. ""Let's just get this over with,"" Ryan mumbled. ""On the count of three, we press enter,"" Derek instructed. Ryan let out a heavy, reluctant sigh but agreed.

""Three.""

I sat at my computer, staring at the screen. Rereading ""*What is your name?*"" over and over.

""Two.""

I quickly typed Mark into the text box.

""One.""

I hit enter.

The box vanished. 

The words ""*Thank you, Damon.*"" took its place.

I sat there puzzled—

How did it know my real name?

""Yo, all I got was this stupid ‘*Thank you, Ryan*’ message. Was something supposed to happen, Derek?"" Ryan asked, annoyed. ""Ye-yeah, same here... ummmm, I don’t know..."" Derek's voice wavered slightly. “You guys I need to let you know some—”

""Welp! I'm just gonna go watch some YouTube and go to bed. See ya!"" Derek cut me off abruptly. 

A second later, he left the call.

“What were you saying Damon?” Ryan asked. “It… it’s nothing…” I decided not to tell him what happened. Ryan and I sat in silence for a moment. Neither of us wanted to admit that something felt off. ""Soooo… I’m gonna go to bed too,"" Ryan finally said. I agreed. We both left the call. But as I stared at my screen, those words still lingered in my head.

“*Thank you, Damon.*”

At around 1:30 in the morning, I woke up to my phone exploding with messages from a frantic Derek.

SleepyBoi420: Guys!

SleepyBoi420: GUYS!!!

SleepyBoi420: Please this is serious!

SleepyBoi420: RYAN!!!

SleepyBoi420: DAMON!!!

SleepyBoi420: Respond!

SleepyBoi420: Respond!!

SleepyBoi420: RESPOND PLEASE!!!

OopsAllParanoia: Why are you going crazy bro? I was sleeping.

404HumorNotFound: same here, this better be good, Derek

SleepyBoi420: Ok ok, so I clicked my YouTube bookmark right, and the deadlinks website popped up with this message

“*A site so old, yet still alive. A single box, a single plea. Enter your name, a message waits. You close the tab, but it's too late. We know your name, Derek.*”

Honestly, I wouldn't have thought twice about it, but every other website I went to had the same message

OopsAllParanoia: Ok… sounds like just some dumb cryptic poem meant to scare you.

SleepyBoi420: Sure, but the thing is, I didn’t even put my name in

404HumorNotFound: YOU SON OF A BITCH!! This was your idea and you didn’t even put your name in?!

SleepyBoi420: I’m sorry!! 

SleepyBoi420: But I don’t know why you’re so mad. You don’t even believe it!

404HumorNotFound: I DON’T! But damn man, what if something did happen? You were just going to leave me and Damon hanging?

SleepyBoi420: I’m sorry man…

OopsAllParanoia: Look, why don’t we just calm down and sleep this off guys? Besides the weird message Derek got, nothing has harmed us. Let’s just call it a night.

404HumorNotFound: fine… goodnight Damon

OopsAllParanoia: Goodnight man

SleepyBoi420: Goodnight Ryan

. . .

SleepyBoi420: ...

OopsAllParanoia: Don’t worry about it D, I’m sure Ryan will be over it by tomorrow.

SleepyBoi420: Yeah, you’re right… Goodnight Damon

OopsAllParanoia: Goodnight bro.

I laid down to go to sleep, but the whole experience kept circling around in my head. There’s no way this stupid website could know who we are… right? ""Whatever, I should just forget about this whole stupid night,"" I muttered, trying to reassure myself.



I woke up to my phone alarm blaring at 9 AM. I had forgotten to turn it off thanks to Derek’s shenanigans last night. 

Groggily, I peeled myself from the bed’s warm embrace, fighting against the invisible arms that tried to pull me back under. By sheer will, I forced myself up and trudged to the bathroom. A cold shower was my first line of defense against exhaustion, jolting me awake before I gradually turned up the heat. Steam filled the room, fogging up the mirror. After stepping out, I wiped it down to brush my teeth. 

That’s when I noticed something was off.

Every forward brushstroke I made was echoed in the mirror with a strange, unnatural delay. My reflection didn’t follow smoothly—it hesitated, lagging, like a fish caught on a taut line. “There’s no way a mirror can lag, right?” I muttered, staring at myself. 

Must be more tired than I thought.

Shaking it off, I decided to clear my head and put last night behind me by treating myself to my favorite coffee spot.

Standing in line, I lazily scanned the menu. This place, like many others, switched to displaying the menu on a TV screen. While I was looking for what sounded good to me, the items disappeared and the screen flashed the words:

""*Thank you, Damon.*""

I blinked and looked around. No one reacted. Customers shuffled forward, heads buried in their phones or in conversations. When I looked back, the menu was normal again. Lack of sleep. Had to be.

I shrugged it off, stepped up, and ordered my usual, giving my name as always. Then I waited. Five minutes. Ten. Names were called—people before and after me—yet mine never came. “Maybe they just missed me,” I thought, walking up to check. My order was there, but instead of Damon, the receipt read: David. I vaguely remembered hearing David get called a few minutes ago, but no one had claimed it. The items were exactly what I ordered, so… close enough I guess. Coffee shops screw up names all the time. 

Grabbing my food, I headed to the park, finding a quiet spot to enjoy my breakfast.

The scenery was gorgeous. California in December meant clear blue skies, lush green trees, and that perfect bite of cold where a hoodie was just enough. The park was unusually quiet for a Saturday. It was ten a.m., and the park was nearly empty—not that I minded. I saw that as a win. 

Just a handful of people loitered around. 

A mother sat on a bench by the playground, glued to her phone, a stroller parked beside her. For a moment, I felt the flicker of something crawl up from the back of my mind—old, heavy memories I’d spent years trying not to unpack. 

I thought of my own mother. The way she used to sit at the kitchen table, half-listening while scrolling through her old beat-up phone. But I shut it down before the thought could finish, like slamming a door on a room I never wanted to open. I darted my eyes around looking for anything to distract me when I noticed a little girl clambering around the jungle gym, though ‘playing’ felt like the wrong word—she moved like she was following a script only she could see. 

I heard the faint crunch of dried grass underfoot. Behind me, about sixty feet away, was a guy in a hoodie, pacing back and forth across the grass in unnaturally long strides. Not jogging. Not speed-walking. 

Just… striding. 

His movements were exaggerated, walking like he didn’t know how his legs worked. It looked insane, but hey, he wasn’t bothering anyone, so I mentally filed him under ‘park weirdo’ and moved on. I sat for about half an hour, enjoying my breakfast, when something started gnawing at me. A wrongness. 

Nobody had come or gone in the entire time I’d been sitting there. 

The striding weirdo never stopped. Never changed pace. The longer I watched him, the more I realized something was off. His hoodie sagged unnaturally low on his body, the sleeves dragging through the grass like limp, empty arms. His legs were freakishly long, yet somehow, he was short. The proportions were all wrong, like someone had cranked up the leg slider in a character creator but forgot to adjust the rest. With the oversized hoodie swallowing his torso.

He didn’t even look like a person—just a head bobbing atop a pair of legs. 

The little girl on the playground, every so often, she’d stop moving entirely, turning her head just to look at me. Just staring. I gave her a small wave, trying to play it off. She didn’t wave back. She didn’t even react. Just kept staring, like a little NPC waiting for me to press the right button. “Kids just do weird shit sometimes,” I told myself. But the words felt less like reassurance and more like a desperate plea to believe that this was still normal.

The mother never looked up from her phone.

Not once.

Not even to check on what I assumed was her kid. She sat too still—too rigid. Almost like a mannequin propped up on the bench. I glanced at the stroller beside her. No rustling. No shifting. Just stillness. Too still. I worked up the courage to approach the young mother. A prickling unease slithered up my spine. Something about this felt off. I swallowed hard and stepped closer. She didn’t react. Didn’t shift. Didn’t even acknowledge me at all. Her daughter still stood in the playground, utterly motionless. Eyes locked onto me, unblinking. “Hi…” My voice came out quieter than I intended. The mother didn’t move. “Um, I—"" I stopped. Realizing she wasn't moving. Not blinking. Not twitching. She wasn't even breathing. My eyes drifted down to her hands. That’s when I noticed. The screen on her phone wasn’t even on.

The stroller jolted.

Something shot out. I barely had time to register it before it vanished into the brush. I turned back to the mother and—

She was gone.

The bench sat empty. I turned to the playground and the creepy little girl was gone too. The stroller sat there, perfectly still, as if no one had ever been there at all.



Trying to get away from the weird shit going on at that park, I decided to go to the mall. It’s the weekend. There had to be tons of people there. I drove to the mall. The roads were busy, cars passing like usual, but when I pulled into the parking lot, my stomach dropped.

It was completely empty.

Not just sparse—vacant.

I sat in my car, gripping the wheel, watching the road. Cars kept driving past, not a single one turning in. It was like the mall didn’t even exist to them. Then, finally, I saw a car pull in. I exhaled, relieved—until I noticed something wrong. As it pulled in, it disappeared, like it was sinking into an invisible void. The back bumper was the last thing to vanish, swallowed as if it had driven behind a mirror. I blinked and rubbed my eyes. The lot was still empty. I turned my attention to the mall entrance. Watching. Waiting. 

Five minutes. Nothing. Another five. No one walked in. No one walked out. Every instinct told me to leave. But I had to know. I got out of the car and walked up to the automatic doors. They slid open instantly and I was greeted with generic pop music. I stepped inside.

It was noon on a Saturday. Almost Christmas. This place should be packed. But it was completely empty. I wandered through the barren halls. Stores were open, fully stocked, yet there were no employees. No shoppers. The lights were on. Registers were running but, it looked as if everyone had just stepped away. “Am I being pranked or something?” I muttered under my breath. A thought crossed my mind—”if no one was here, what's stopping me from taking something?” 

I shut that thought down immediately.

Still, with no one around, I felt… wrong. Like I was trespassing somewhere I shouldn’t be. It took me entirely too long to realize that the music had changed.  The cookie cutter pop music was replaced with a droning piano melody—thin, stretched, and off-key. Like an old record player dying mid-spin. While I made my way through the empty lobby of the mall I heard something that made goosebumps erupt along my arms.

Footsteps.

Not the light tap of sneakers. Not dress shoes clicking against tile. It was bare feet slapping the floor. A guttural growl echoed from somewhere deep down the corridor. Low. Rumbling. I darted into the nearest open store, knocking over a display case in my rush. It hit the floor with a shattering crash. 

Shit. 

No time to worry about that. I needed to hide. I had bolted into a women’s clothing store so naturally I started towards the dressing room. ""No—idiot, that's way too obvious,"" I thought, silently roasting myself. Then, my eyes landed on a pink door at the back of the store. 

An employee’s section.

I sprinted toward it and grabbed the handle. It turned. I threw myself inside into a long, dimly lit hallway that stretched endlessly in both directions. Behind me, I heard it—the crunch of glass. My stomach twisted.

It was inside the store. 

There was no time to make a choice. Instincts took over and I darted to the right. The hallway seemed endless and it felt like I had been running for the past ten minutes, my heart pounding. ""This doesn’t make sense. The mall isn’t this big."" I thought. Suddenly, I slid to a stop. A figure stood ahead of me. A dark silhouette with long black hair. It was standing still. Motionless. My chest seized with pure, cold terror. Behind it…

The pink door.

The same one I had used to enter the hallway. I had been running straight. But I ended up back where I started?? The figure stepped forward. I turned around but this time, I searched frantically for any door. Anything I might have missed. Between the sound of my own racing footsteps, I heard it. Slow. Heavy. Steps.

It was following me.

Not chasing. Just following. Like it thought there was no escape for me. My confusion deepened when I saw that the hallway now ended in a solid wall, with only a single door. I didn’t hesitate. The door shattered open under my weight, the world spinning around me as I stumbled forward—and into darkness.

The air was cold. Crisp. I was outside. But something was wrong. I had only been inside for an hour. Two at most. But the sky above me was a deep, suffocating black. It was night. I looked back and the door was gone. I couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. I just knew I needed to get the hell out of here right now.

I scanned the parking lot. My car was sitting just a few yards away. Untouched. Sitting right where I left it. I staggered toward it, exhausted, every inch of me screaming to just get inside and leave. I flew out of the parking lot. Driving well past the speed limit, replaying the bizarre events of the day over and over in my head. The lagging mirror while brushing my teeth. The striding weirdo, the silent little girl, the still woman and the empty mall. It all felt… wrong, like puzzle pieces that didn’t quite fit together. The streetlights cast long, unnatural shadows as I pulled out onto the road. It was just past eleven p.m. and the streets were just an endless stretch of asphalt swallowed by darkness. 

My hands gripped the steering wheel, the hum of the engine and the occasional flicker of passing streetlights were the only things keeping me company. I glanced in the rearview mirror to check if the mall was still behind me—and for just a split second, I saw something. A shape—small, barely noticeable—the very top of a head peeking up from the backseat.

I sucked in a breath, my pulse hammering against my ribs. My grip on the wheel tightened as I forced myself to keep my eyes on the road. I must have imagined it. A trick of the light, or maybe the exhaustion was starting to play with my head.

But I had seen something.

I stole another glance.

Nothing.

Another.

Still nothing.

I kept flicking my gaze between the road and the mirror, waiting for movement, waiting for something to change. With each glance, my nerves wound tighter and tighter, expecting—no, dreading—a face to rise up behind me. After glancing what felt like twenty times, relief. Nothing was there. I exhaled, letting out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. My muscles uncoiled slightly, my heartbeat slowing to a steadier rhythm. “See? Just my imagination.” I said to reassure myself.

The empty road stretched ahead, and as I reached for the turn signal, getting ready to merge right. I glanced at my side mirror and from the corner of my eye, something wasn’t right. It took a second for my brain to process it. The faint glint of pale skin. The curvature of fingers. Long, blood red fingers. Wrapped around the headrest of my passenger seat. My breath caught, my whole body going rigid. Slowly—so painfully slowly—I turned my head just a little more. Staring back just inches from me—

A face.

A hollow, sunken thing. Its eyes were wide, unblinking, black pits that seemed to swallow the light. Its skin was pulled too tight over its skull, stretched thin and sickly pale, the texture like something long dead. Its mouth was too wide, too sharp, curling into something that wasn’t quite a smile. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t move. It just stared. And then—

It grinned.

I slammed the brakes so hard I almost spun out. I veered to the side of the road, heart pounding against my ribs. I threw the door open and scrambled out. I swallowed hard, gripping the edge of the car trying to catch my breath. My pulse throbbed in my ears. 

I looked back into my driver side window and it was gone. I peered through the backseat window—nothing. Just to be sure, I popped the trunk—empty. That thing—whatever it was, was gone. Maybe I was just on edge. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. I forced myself back into the driver’s seat, gripping the wheel tight. I looked back over my shoulders.

Nothing.



I needed to get home. Now. As I pulled back onto the road, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somewhere in the darkness behind me, something was still there. Still watching. I drove home with my doors unlocked. I pulled into my driveway, heart pounding. As soon as I put the car in park, I yanked the keys out, threw the door open, and slammed it shut behind me. My hands fumbled to lock it—hopefully trapping whatever the hell might’ve been in there inside.

The night felt heavier now, the air thick. I turned toward my house. It was completely dark. Not a single light on. I opened the door. I needed light. Now. I flicked the switch by the door.

Nothing.

“Oh, fuck no!” I said out loud. The power company never sent out a blackout notice. This wasn’t normal. The breaker maybe? I turned on my phone’s flashlight and stepped back outside. My house was old, and for whatever reason, the breaker box was mounted on the side. As I walked past my car, I hesitated, glancing through the windshield. The backseat was empty. But that didn’t make me feel any better.

I forced myself to keep moving, pushing through the wooden gate that led to the narrow alley between my house and my neighbor’s towering brick fence. The darkness stretched forever, the alley feeling twice as long as I knew it was. Every tiny noise made me paranoid—rustling leaves, twigs snapping. It’s probably just a small animal. 

Yeah that’s it.

When I found the breaker. My heart sank to my knees. The door to the breaker was wide open and the switch had been flipped off.

Someone did this.

I slammed it back on and tore through the alley, through the gate, up the porch steps, and into my house, slamming the door shut behind me. I locked it, my breath ragged. The sound of a rapid, scratching patter flew across my kitchen floor behind me. My blood ran cold. It sounded like a dog—long nails clicking against the wood.

But I didn’t have a dog.

""…If it was a dog, wasn’t that better than the alternative?"" I thought, trying to reassure myself. Swallowing hard, I forced my legs to move. Step by step, I crept toward the kitchen, my hand trembling as I reached for the switch.

The lights flickered on.

The room was empty. No dog. No person. Nothing. But somehow… somehow, it felt worse than before. I ignored the unease clawing at my gut and made my way upstairs, flicking on every light as I went. The brightness should have been comforting. It wasn’t. The shadows felt like they were watching.

I sat at my desk, flipped open my laptop, and signed in.

*discord ping*

SleepyBoi420: Hey Damon, have you heard from Ryan at all today?

OopsAllParanoia: Nah, he hasn’t hit me up yet. I take it you guys haven’t made up then?

SleepyBoi420: No… I sent him a bunch of messages apologizing, but he never replied. In fact, I don’t think he even got on today.

OopsAllParanoia: Well, let’s hop in a call. Maybe he’ll pick up.

SleepyBoi420: Sure…

The group call rang. 

Ryan’s profile was grayed out as Derek and I sat in silence, waiting. He didn’t answer. I went to message him when I saw him enter the call. I exhaled. “There he is.”

“Hey Ryan, where have you been, man?” Derek asked.

. . .

Derek hesitated. “Ry—” A sound cut him off. A deep, inhuman rasping breath. Static crackled through the speakers. ""Wh… where…"" The distortion twisted, wet and wrong. ""Ha… have…"" A thick, gurgling noise seeped through, like something too large, too heavy was shifting against the mic. ""…y… you…"" My throat tightened. “Ryan, what are you doing?”

“Yeah, that’s not fucking funny, bro!” Derek barked.

No response. Just guttural, sucking gasps, like something was trying to form words but didn’t have the right mouth for it. “Okay, Ryan, you can stop now…” I muttered. The static surged—then cut out.

Silence.

""Okay, Ryan, you can stop now."" My own voice said back to us. It wasn’t an echo. It wasn’t a replay. It was off. Like something was trying on my voice like a new coat. A chill lanced through my spine. I saw Derek leave the call.  I tried to leave too but the button wouldn’t work. ""How the hell did he leave?"" I thought, my stomach knotting. My laptop screen flickered.  

Without any warning—my webcam switched on.

Cold panic gripped me. I didn’t think—I just slammed my laptop shut. My hands were shaking. ""Okay, okay… the screen is shut. It should go to sleep in a few seconds."" The speakers crackled.

My own voice spilled out into the room.

""Damon… where are you… Damon… where are you… Damon… where are you…"" I yanked the charger from my laptop, flipped it over and took out the battery. The voice didn't stop. My heart pounded and as I turned to leave the room—

My phone rang.

The sound nearly made me jump out of my skin. My ringtone blasted at full volume. I fumbled for my phone. Derek. I answered immediately. “Dude, are you good? What’s going on?” My voice was frantic, breathless. Derek’s voice was quiet. Shaky. “Damon…”

He paused.

Then he said, barely above a whisper—“There’s something in my closet.” My blood ran cold. “What are you talking about?” I asked frantically. “Laughing… it’s laughing in my closet…” His voice wavered, as if he were on the verge of tears.

And then I heard it.

A low, wheezy chuckle filtered through the call. The sound was unnatural—wet and ragged, like a chain-smoker exhaling through shredded lungs. Derek’s voice broke through, barely holding steady. “Damon… what do I do?” His words were small, scared. I opened my mouth to answer, forcing down the rising panic. “You need to get ou—”

The call ended abruptly.

I tried calling him back—once, twice, five times. Voicemail, every time. My heart started pounding as my brain clawed through possible scenarios—maybe he dropped the phone running; maybe the thing had cornered him; maybe he was already...

That’s when I realized—

The voice from my laptop was growing louder. More distorted and warped. The speakers crackled like they were about to blow out—

The voice stopped.

After waiting a few minutes I slowly lifted my laptop screen. I was greeted by the same phrase I’ve seen since last night…

“*Thank you, Damon.*”

I barely had time to breathe before—the lights went out. I reached for my lamp. Nothing. ""Oh no… please don’t be the breaker again. Not right now."" I muttered. I stepped towards the door, fumbling in the darkness. My fingers brushed the handle. From the other side of the door I heard—

""Damon… I found you.""

It was my voice, muffled behind the closed door. Every muscle in my body locked. The door creaked open. It stopped, just slightly ajar. Just enough for me to see a familiar face.

The face from my car. This time just a few short inches away.

Grinning. A too-wide, too-sharp, toothy grin.

And this time, it didn’t disappear.

I’m 22, and currently studying Biology + Industrial Engineering (focused on ecology & animal physiology). I live a structured, disciplined life, but I’m also trying to open myself to new experiences and perspectives. I’m a slim nerd, Arab–Chinese, 5'8"", and based in Indonesia.

I’m looking for a partner for long-term relationship from anywhere, I also don't mind having LDR too! as long as we get along, it’s all good. I’m into lifelong learning and real talks, so I’d love to meet people who love talking about life, ideas, and random interesting things.

For fun, I listen to pop, alternative, rock, country, classics, and folk. I read sci-fi, draw imaginary maps, and I’m a beginner at traveling. Biology fieldwork also gets me outdoors a lot, so I love exploring Indonesia’s nature. I’m also into culinary adventures and healthy living (not vegetarian), and lately I’ve been doing a lot of cardio. I had retinal detachment before so I can't do any activities that can make my eyes strained.

I also like memes, cats, PC games (Stardew Valley, Fall Guys, TheHunter, Terraria, Minecraft), horror movies, and a bit of anime (Chainsaw Man, Azumanga Daioh, Demon Slayer, Haikyuu!!, Gachiakuta, Dr. Stone, and Doraemon!). Oh, and coffee + matcha at the same time!

I value mutual respect and balanced energy. I’m a bit old-fashioned about communication and boundaries, and I’m not into adult things easily. I’m also into phone detox and productivity, mindful tech use, deep work/focus time, and being present offline so it’s a plus if you relate. Oh yeah and I'm not into hookups too!

For compatibility, I'm looking for an old-fashioned relationship with someone more dominant and mature in personality than me. I would describe myself as more a versatile in personality and being more a sub or power-sub in term of intimacy. I don't have any age preferences, I don't mind if you're whether younger (18+ ofc) or older than me

But this behavior in real life only happens when it's just the two of us, which isn't very often. However, with our group of friends, she barely looks me in the eye or speaks to me. I'm the only man whose she does this. With the others, it's the contrary. 

On the other hand, via text, the dynamic is very different:
she never initiates the conversation, her replies are polite, sometimes quick, but not very engaging, and she doesn't initiate anything herself. 

Anyway, on January 9th, I mustered up the courage and sent her a message to see if she'd like to grab a drink or some tea since I was in her neighborhood. She replied that she'd love to, but she was on vacation and therefore unavailable. She replied quickly, like in 3 minutes. 

She starts her internship on the 19th, and I plan to message her, partly to find out how her first day went and to take the opportunity to suggest we go out together. 

But now I'm worried I might be pushing too hard to get us to go on a date, even though it's my second suggestion overall. I should also mention that we haven't texted since January 9th. She probably knows I like her, given the signals I'm sending in real life. Besides, the next time we're supposed to see each other in person won't be until February 6th. That's a bit of a long time when you're really into someone... 

Anyway, what do you think? Should I suggest it again or wait a bit, like until February 6th?
And here is some positives signals from her, or I'm just making movies in my head?",2,1768781019.0,Crushes,2,1.0,False

I'm  inexperienced yet open minded and kinky. I'm in my early thirties. A 6 footer. I'm  looking for a open minded kinky single girl who would love to have a fun time with. No stings attached but I would love to build a friendship first. The reason I'm reluctant to go for a prostitute is STDs and also the inability to have the whole experience. I believe sex is more that just intercourse. It should be romantic and intimate. 

I would love to eat her out and pleasure her as much as possible. I mean I want both the parties to be fully satisfied with the experience. And depending on her kinks I'd love to explore as much as kinks possible.

Even though I'm damn kinky inside my mind I've never agree  encourage cheating. And would never be with a girl who's in a relationship or a marriage without their partner knowing. I mean if the partner is a cuck then I wouldn't mind. But unless that I prefer it to be with a single girl. 

I would also consider being with a cuck couple or for a threesome with a couple. However I'm not willing to swap much pics beforehand. Prefer to have a chat over a coffee.

1qgof3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1qgof3d/the_colonizers_historical_adventuresatire/,The Colonizers (Historical Adventure/Satire),"Our wake divides a vast expanse of shimmering blue sea, empty except for our pursuer, a French ship-of-the-line with all her sails spread.

Too many for this wind, I think, reaching for my coffee.

Through the stern windows, I see puffs of smoke from her bow chasers. One ball falls short, a plume of white water near our stern, the other skips and crashes through the windows.

I feel the heat as it passes a hair’s-breadth from my hand, taking the coffee cup with it.

“Miss Fielding!” I say in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel.

“Sir?” My steward’s concerned face appears at the door. Her eyes fall to shattered dishes, tablecloth askew, then back to me with something like accusation.

“Another cup please, thank you ma’am,” I say, surprised at the meekness in my tone.

She salutes sullenly and disappears.

In the Navy we’d have keelhauled her, I reflect.

But a smuggling ship is a private venture, crewed by volunteers. My authority stems from the fact that none of these other sods can lead our ship through a squall on a lee shore, navigate the Sicilian channels, or gauge the precise moment a French 3-decker’s topmast will crack.

Which should be right about…now.

The sailors on deck give a wild cheer as it topples, hanging off the French ship’s side in a hopeless confusion of blocks, ropes and sailcloth.

“Too much sail,” I say when Miss Fielding returns with the coffee. She shrugs.

The coffee is hot and strong. I take several triumphant gulps before heading out on deck.

Mr. Blythe turns from the taffrail and approaches. He’s a thin, pale, odd-looking fellow we picked up in Port Mahon; said he needed quiet passage, no papers. With his black coat and iced-over eyes he may as well have “Assassin” tattooed on his forehead.

I focus my telescope on a passing shearwater, hoping my concentration will put him off.

“More trouble, Captain?”

“Almost certainly. In fact, I’d better have a look from the masthead.”

I spring for the rigging and climb on muscle-memory alone, the deck shrinking away beneath my feet.

No sooner had I reached the startled lookout then there came cries from below:

“What’s that lubber doing?”

“Damn fool. He’ll break his neck!”

Peering over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled in the rigging. He’s followed me up, the pragmatical bastard!

Halfway he slips, falling backward with his feet caught in the shrouds, his body swinging with the roll of the ship and a look of pure horror on his face.

Miss Fielding was at that moment climbing the opposite rigging with the kettle’s leather strap in her teeth. She hangs it on a ratline, leaps for the backstay and swings across to Mr. Blythe, setting him upright.

“Not like that,” she says, moving his hands from the horizontal ropes to the vertical. “Hold these here. Like so.”

Five minutes later, we pull Mr. Blythe up onto our platform. He at once wraps both arms and legs around the mast, eyes closed and looking quite ridiculous.

“Come sir, open your eyes!” I say. “You’ll not miss the view? It’s quite spectacular.”

Reluctantly, Mr Blythe opens one eye, then the other. His face changes from fear to astonishment, then wonder at the infinite blue rolling away on all sides.

“I’m amazed!” He says, relinquishing his hold. A smile breaks out across his reptilian face. “Amazed!”

“Take my telescope,” I say, unsure why I no longer find him off-putting. “There, to starboard…no sir, starboard…there you are, sir…you can make out the western tip of Formentera.”

“Incredible,” he says, sweeping the glass back and forth.

The kettle makes its way up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love.

Suddenly Blythe freezes, the telescope pointing south. “And what are those sleek, shiny vessels coming around the cliffs there? Are they racing?”

It’s as I feared. We’d outrun a French 3-decker, but these harbor police with their American-built flyers are the fastest sailors afloat.

“Baltimore clippers,” I say, tossing my cigar over the side. “Revenue cutters.”

Back in my cabin I make a bundle of our ship’s log, bills of lading, port authorizations, and a four-pound cannonball, then toss it through the shattered stern ports.

Miss Fielding appears with my best coat and number one hat, which I don sideways like an old-fashioned commodore. Buckling my sword, I take a new packet of false papers under my arm and stride out.

The cutters are much closer now.

“Inspection!” Hails a voice from the nearest, and my heart drops. Lieutenant Turnbull. “Spill your wind and lie-to under my leeward rail. Under…my…leeward…rail!”

“Fuck their leeward rail,” says Miss Fielding.

The cutters hook on, and Turnbull scampers up the ladder, followed by a score of men with muskets.

“I’m looking for your passenger,” he says.

“Passenger?” I look up and down the deck, quizzical as a cat.

“Come, Captain, that will not do. You know the fellow I’m speaking of: black coat, ill-looking. Spanish passport.”

“Oh, him, yes. We dropped him off in Gibraltar. Between you and me, sir,” lowering my voice, “he had something of the air of a criminal.”

“Indeed?” The lieutenant brought his face closer. “Are you aware sir, that this fellow you’re protecting is a bounty hunter for inquisition?”

I knew it, an assassin! The satisfaction brings a smile before I can stop myself.

“Find it funny, do you?” Turnbull’s face changes color. “Eight pounds a head…thumscrews, the rack…Christ, sir, even you cannot say that don’t strike you as dirty.”

Did he say eight pounds a head? I was crunching numbers before he finished speaking.

“Suppose you find him…I imagine I’ll be going along…that is to say, I’d be arrested, too?”

“Summarily,” says Turnbull, “but only as a formality, were you to save us a long search. Three days in the brig at Minorca and you’re back at sea.”

I point upward. “He’s at the masthead. Pray, let me run up and see him down, Lieutenant. He’s apt to fall otherwise.”",1,1768780537.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

1qgobzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_julylifecoach/comments/1qgobzg/my_neighbors/,My Neighbors,"I grew up in the southern port city of Busan in South Korea. South Korea is a small country, it's around the size of Rhode Island; but it's a dense country with a population way higher than the land available. So we have a lot of high rise apartments and this makes for an interesting neighbor interaction that you might not have experienced if you grew up in more horizontal environments.

Neighborhoods, as I experienced it in North America, are about stretches of land. You have houses in that stretch and usually sub-groups of that stretch form the community you'll interact with. I think you have more options for neighborhoods in Korea (or in any other culture that has high rise apartments as the norm) because you can form a community horizontally and vertically in the same apartment AND horizontally across the stretch of land.

The first neighbor I remember was a family that really resembled us. They were a family with two kids, Bo-Hyun and Bora; Bo-Hyun was the same age as my sister (one year older than me) and Bora was younger than I was. The moms would always hang out with each other so when I come back from school I would frequently return home to their home instead of mine. Mom would have coffee with their mom and I would take naps on their sofa. Sometimes my mom wouldn't even be there and I'd still feel home!

Then I moved to Canada and the idea of neighbors were very different. Bo-Hyun's family was just one primary neighbor we interacted with, but there were plenty more so I was used to meeting at least 10 neighbors to and from school. Now we went to school and back with cars, and we only met 2 neighbors, 3 if we were lucky. Also one of the neighbors was our landlord so does that count at all?

Our landlord's family was an Indian family of 5. I didn't know much about India so I didn't know what part of India they were from, but I distinctly remember their greeting: Sat Sri Akaal, and now Wikipedia tells me it's actually Punjabi. Which also makes sense because now I'm reminded that the father of the family wore a turban. We played with their kids a lot and they taught me how to play hockey. How intensely Canadian! 

Then we came to California and lived in an apartment complex. This was always strange to me because apartment is ""apateu"" (thanks Rose, it's easier to explain this now) in Korean but in America apartments weren't high rise buildings. With the complex it was easy to meet many neighbors simply by walking through the lot for laundry or taking out the trash. But for some reason it was difficult to have an intimate neighborhood relationship with the neighbors around us, like we did in Korea. Maybe my parents wanted to hang more with Koreans? Maybe they felt a little conscious being people of color (in California? Maybe...) ?

Later with time I went to college and now my neighbors were the bane of my life. As a depressed dude trying to brood in his room rowdy college students were my archenemies. They were just living their life and I was petty enough to despise them for it! The smell of weed, the smell of alcohol, the sound of music, outside bar noise, I did not enjoy a moment of it. I think that's when I started playing guitar more seriously and there was that one time a neighbor complained about my guitar, so I guess I was also one of those people for them!

Now I live with my wife in this single family home for the first time in my life. I'm so lucky to be surrounded by neighbors who take care of each other. We refer each other to good handypeople, we text each other about coyotes, exchange food, chat while walking our dogs... I really appreciate the neighbors I have today and through writing this and walking down memory lane I see that the idea of neighbors change a lot throughout environments and time.

The college story reminded me that I need to be a good neighbor as much as I want to be surrounded by good neighbors. Am I being a good neighbor right now? I'll chew on that as I pick up some trash in my cul de sac. ",1,1768780305.0,u_julylifecoach,0,1.0,False

This was strictly espresso use. My grind settings were consistently between 15–20. I followed all best practices: adjusting grind size only while running, regular cleaning, bellows use, and RDT. Static buildup was noticeable and none of this prevented clogging.

When I brought it in for service/return, multiple staff members at ECS said this is a known and fairly common DF54 issue, especially over the past few weeks. One person said anything under a 40 setting is likely to clog, another said under 10 which at least makes more sense for espresso, but the contradiction itself was concerning. I was also told that a clog every 1–2 weeks is considered normal, even with cleaning.

What really doesn’t sit right is that the DF54 is promoted in-store as a “Staff Pick”, yet staff also mentioned the issue is so common lately that they’ve printed out a troubleshooting pamphlet to hand to customers because of the number of returns and service cases. That feels backwards like why actively promote a grinder when a known issue is causing frequent returns?

To make it worse, even with this being acknowledged as a known problem, returns are still subject to a 20% restocking fee. So customers are essentially eating a penalty for an issue the shop already knows about and is still being “worked on” by the manufacturer.

I’m not saying all DF54s are bad, plenty of people seem to have zero issues, but at \~$350, repeated clogging, inconsistent guidance, and unclear expectations around what’s “normal” are hard to justify, especially for espresso-focused users.

Question for other DF54 owners (especially those who bought from ECS):

Has anyone else experienced this? Did you just deal with it or find a reliable fix, or did you end up switching grinders? I’ve heard about the metal declumper mod, but honestly it feels pretty shit to have to mod a two-week-old grinder just to make it usable.

Would appreciate hearing others’ experiences.",1,1768780296.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I’m South American, last year I went with my wife to Adelaide CBD to celebrate our first Australian Day. we bought some little australian flags but it was a big surprise that we found only Asian food, dances and performances from every country except Australia, and people dressed with typical clothing from their other countries.

  
i mean, I understand multiculturalism, and it’s fine. it’s important. but… we already celebrated our Latino culture in some other days here, and many other cultures, but what about Australian culture? Feels more like multiculturalism culture day or immigrant day. not even aboriginal culture.

  
we expected… idk, to find some fish and chips, meat pies, bbq, kangaroo, snags, good coffee, aussie beer, even at least, aussie wine. Aussie music, country, (at least they performed waltzing Matilda by the end of the day), some things related with aussie icons or history (steve irwin, governor Arthur Philip,  explorer Sturt, James Cook, at the end of the day, this day is to celebrate the arrival of the first fleet), etc. but nothing happened.

  
so, my question is, where can we find that? will we have better chance if we go to some towns out of Adelaide? as nuriootpa, renmark, Murray bridge, victor harbor, etc?

  
sorry if this is offensive, its just curiosity. I don’t think is right when people say “australia does not have any culture” but I just don’t found it last year.",0,1768780189.0,AskAnAustralian,36,0.48,False

1qgo7yl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qgo7yl/the_deserted_village_part_2/,The Deserted Village [Part 2],"When I told Stephen about my discovery, he moved faster than the wind. John Joe and I followed, the former asking persistent questions.

“What did the skull look like?”

I shrugged, “Like a skull,”

“Yeah, but human or animal?”

“Human. I don’t think Stephen would care if it was a sheep’s skull,”

“Oh, I would,” John Joe grinned, “Imagine that hanging on your wall,”

I raised an eyebrow, “You have a wall now?”

“Sometimes.”

Before I could dwell further on his cryptic words, we found Stephen, practically dancing over the morbid discovery.

“Hang on!” He cried out, motioning for us to stop, “Nobody take another step. There might be more bones under the dirt.”

I thought back to the supposed rocks I tripped over, and shivered. Peering closer, I saw that both eye sockets were fractured, its jaw open in a silent scream. There were three notches carved into the frontal bone. I felt the weight of such a discovery, and was genuinely happy for Stephen,

“I imagine this will get you some bragging rights at school?”

“Oh, you have no idea,” Stephen pulled out his phone, snapping pictures from every angle, “These are going straight to my professor when I get service.”

“Are you going to dig it up?”

“No! Are you crazy?” Stephen looked down at the skull, wagging his fingers,

“I’ll have to get a group out here.”

John Joe knelt in front of the skull, whistling as he did,

“What do you think was the cause of death?”

“It’s hard to tell in this state but see the teeth?”

The skull’s few remaining teeth were brown and cracked, looking more like wood chips than teeth.

“It looks like starvation. Or scurvy.”

He said it like a child declaring their favourite food.

After marking the site with rocks, and a spare pair of shoes, the trio turned back towards the campsite. Stephen chattered excitedly all the way back, John Joe listened while I trailed after them. Lost in my thoughts, I caught sight of that deep red again. I followed the movement of bush bobbing in the wind, following us.

John Joe had set up camp in the roofless cottage. The drystone walls were a meter thick, a cold, ancient hearth sat in the corner. The alcove painted black with a century of soot, flakes of turf crushed into the stone.

“It’s going to be cold,” I told him,

“The walls will block the wind,” he said like it was the most obvious thing in the world, “We’ll light a fire, and you brought your sleeping bag, didn’t you?”

I sighed, “Yes.”

The sun, still hidden by the grey clouds, began to set. The sky darkened with every passing moment.

“I’ll get the fire started,” John Joe announced, kneeling in front of the dead hearth.

I tossed wood towards him, hoping it wasn’t too damp to ignite. Stephen was busy trying to get service, alternating between typing and voice messages.

Soon, the fire was blazing, I didn’t realise I missed the heat until the cold left my bones. I held my hands in front of the flames, feeling my fingers tingle. The sky was now a dusky, dark colour, a few stars blinked down at me. John Joe was right, it was going to be a starry night. Over the wind battering the decrepit rocks, my ears pricked at something else. A scuff on the rocks, the kind only a shoe could make. Then, Stephen leapt over the low wall, plopping himself beside me.

He nudged me, “You alright?” I jumped, blinking at his sudden appearance,

“Yeah, why?”

“You’re quiet,”

I shrugged, not knowing how to answer,

“Just thinking.”

He gave me a look that I couldn’t place. Was he waiting for me to say something else?

Stephen nodded, “You ready for food?”

Without waiting for an answer, he rushed to his bag and pulled out two plastic packets,

“I brought ready to eat pasta,” he brandished them like a pack of cards.

“Oh…,” I sighed again, “You shouldn’t have.”

“I just need hot water, John Joe, you got a kettle?”

John Joe looked up from his fish gutting, knuckle deep in a trout, before handing over a tin kettle,

I quickly put a hand, “No need. I have my own stuff.”

He waited for me to pull out my own meal, and the way his face fell put a weight in my stomach.

“Is that it?” Stephen asked, I looked down at my packet of rich tea and ready-mix coffee,

“Yeah.”

He shook his head, “We’re here for three days, Niall,”

I sighed in irritation, “I’ll be fine.”

Stephen opened his mouth to say something else, but I interrupted by loudly opening the plastic packet. The biscuit turned to ash in my mouth, but with both men’s eyes on me, I forced down three. They sat like rocks in my stomach. I watched the others prepare their own food; John Joe speared his fish, dusted it in salt, and stuck it next to the fire. Stephen waited for his carbonara, shooting me looks I tried to ignore. The smell of both turned my stomach, I had to bury my nose in the steam of my coffee. It didn’t protect me from the sounds. Gnashing teeth, slurping, crunching, smacking lips. It was a miracle I didn’t bring the biscuits back up.

When everyone was fed and watered, bundled in our sleeping bags like fat caterpillars, we sat back in the soft grass, gazing up at the twinkling stars, with the wind and distant lapping of waves ready to lull us to sleep. But, of course, Stephen had to ruin it.

“Niall,” his voice broke the comfortable silence. His concerned tone made me groan internally,

“I don’t know how to bring this up,”

“Then don’t.”

“I have to,” he almost snapped,

“Why?” I propped up on one elbow, “Why do you always have to say something?”

Hurt flickered over his face, luckily, John Joe was there. He tapped Stephen’s shoulder, whispering something in his ear, while they both glanced at me. He shut up at John Joe’s words, for that, I was grateful.

“So…” John Joe said, trying to break the awkward silence,

“Stephen, do you have any ghost stories about this place?”

And, just like flipping a switch, Stephen went off.

“Well, not ghost stories, but the famine is scarier than anything I could come up with.” His gestures became more animated,

“Come on then,” John Joe patted his shoulder, “Regale us with some tales.”

Despite my earlier irritation, I couldn’t help leaning in to listen.

“Now,” Stephen began,

“As we all know, Ireland suffered terribly during the Famine, but islands like these were most affected. Think about it, they weren’t allowed to fish,”

“What? Why?”

“Exports, whatever food they had was taken from them to sell,” Stephen explained sadly, “That’s why the potato was so important. It was the only food that was truly theirs, and when that failed, they had nothing.”

“An already small, isolated community to have their only food source rot in the ground. It was like a cruel joke.” He shook his head, as if reliving an awful memory,

“Winter came and went, crops continued to fail, and the people grew hungrier. A type of hunger that settled in your bones like an ache.”

“Too soon, the waters were emptied of fish, all known game hunted, and some even turned to eating moss off rocks, which, according to my sources, gave them horrible rashes.” He just had to add in another fact.

“Every potato planted rotted in the ground like a corpse. Anyone caught stealing food was killed on the spot, didn’t matter if they were young or old. One of my sources tells of a landlord’s experience when he travelled through town to collect rent. First, he described the smell, he was surrounded by a sour smell, it hung thick in the air like decay. Second, was the sound.” His voice turned flat, as if reading off a page etched into his memory.

“Cries upon cries ripped through the air. A cacophony of despair. He saw little wretched creatures cowering by the side of the road, clinging to their mother, not realising she had already died. Wasted away.”

“He remarked how his tenants looked like they crawled out of their own graves. Moaning, shambling masses, nothing but bones and rags. That was what Ireland had been reduced to.” Stephen stopped, casting his head down, a show of respect for those that died. I listened, enthralled,

“Did anyone ever…you know…?”

I couldn’t say the word, “Like the Donner party?”

Stephen was quiet for a moment, his sharp inhale the only sign that he heard me,

“There are no recorded cases of it happening,” he took another slurp of noodles,

“But, there is always speculation.”

I looked at Stephen over the fire, the flames glinted off his red hair, making his head light up like a match.

“I remember reading somewhere that a young boy was once brought to court. He was just a tiny, shivering bundle of rags, what was his crime? They found him chewing on the leg of his deceased mother.”

His words hung in the air, the shared image in our heads killed any retort I had ready,

“Stranger still, that wasn’t the only one.”

“A man lost an ear in a fight and could only watch as his attacker swallowed it whole. Another story tells of a young girl that reduced her family to viscera-painting the cottage in blood. Apparently, a priest wanted to exorcise her.”

John Joe leaned forward, “Did he?”

Stephen shrugged, “I don’t know. The story ends with him getting his fingers bitten off.”

Stephen put down his food, suddenly looking sick,

“I mean, it’s understandable. When you’re pushed to the brink like that, anyone would succumb to their basic instincts. You try to seek comfort from your mother, but the only comfort she can give is her flesh.”

“Imagine the hunger that can force you to turn on your loved ones.”

The pensive silence from his final words was broken by John Joe slapping the ground with his hand,

“Is that who we found up there?” He jabbed a thumb at the looming cliff, “Someone’s leftovers?”

To my surprise, Stephen shook his head,

“It’s all just speculation, like I said, there’s no sources to prove it.”

“Well, why would there be?” I chimed in, “Who would document that?”

Stephen didn’t answer, just loudly slurped down his pasta juice. I watched as he chased it with a bread roll, then a chocolate bar.

“It’s getting late.” He announced, “We should get some sleep.”

John Joe had already curled up like a cat, while Stephen pulled out his book and a torch, his eyes dancing in the low light. I downed the last of my coffee, its warmth comforting as I gazed up at the night sky. The wind caressed the stones, whistling in some places. The rustling grass and turning pages became a background melody. As I lay there, the biscuits churning in my stomach, a knot of regret rose within me. I tried focusing on a singular star, breathing in deeply as I watched it blink. Like a child seeking comfort from a night light, soon, my eyes grew heavy. Despite sleep coming easy, it was not restful. I tossed and turned; my mind filled with unsettling images. Empty faces with hollow cheeks stared down at me, silently gnashing their teeth. In the dream I stared back, unable to tear my gaze away.

I think I woke up only once to total darkness. The fire had long since been snuffed out. The wind had a new bite to it. Shivering in my sleeping bag, l looked up, but the stars were gone. The night sky an endless pool of ink. I stared up into the void, and I could feel it staring back.",2,1768780009.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

In the dream I stared back, unable to tear my gaze away. 

I think I woke up only once to total darkness. The fire had long since been snuffed out. The wind had a new bite to it. Shivering in my sleeping bag, l looked up, but the stars were gone. The night sky an endless pool of ink. I stared up into the void, and I could feel it staring back.

I am fine with a few different options but I am worried my wife might be overwhelmed by a full manual machine due to the attention needed to operated it. We both really enjoy our espresso and are roasting our own beans, so I know we need an equipment upgrade to really enjoy our roasts. 

We tend to only make 1-4 drinks per day, though at times we have parties with 20+ in attendance where most want a coffee as well. We tend to make more iced lattes for on the move friendly options, but really the steam portion of the Breville leaves a lot to be desired and likely contributes to the lack of hot drinks we consume. I am very mechanical in nature and enjoy operating equipment, thus I think I would enjoy a full manual control machine. However I worry about my wife not enjoying the new machine if she has to really keep up with timers, flow control, etc.

Sex : F

Ferritin is sitting at 18 now. Been struggling with it around this level since before March 2025. 
Hemoglobin is normal range but lowerside.
B12 is slightly deficient below normal.
RBC is fluctuating within normal.
Recently tested vitamin D and its very very low.
Doctor prescribed 50,000 UI once a week because she knows how crappy I feel. 
I work a physical job cleaning houses and its been slowing me down heavily or killing me to get things done. I deal with multiple mental health issues.
BPD, OCD. I also have ADHD. That all contributes to depression and anxiety.
We have tested for celiac disease. It was negative and I don't really get any of the symptoms besides that can be explained by low iron, low b12, and low vitamin D.
I can't sleep properly but magnesium is within normal range.

I'm just getting frustrated at this point. I'm not sure if I'm not taking it enough. I'm taking 150mg of FERAMAX, I was not taking it consistently at the beginning because it says to take it by itself on an empty stomach, not with dairy products, meds, or caffine. At first it was like okay when the hell am I supposed to take it then? I was really frustrated by all the parameters. I have OCD where I follow things to a T. I can become easily distressed when I dont know when or how to do things. 

I take ADHD meds. Also need to eat breakfast before I have coffee. Not a morning person. Someone who eats quickly prepared meals runs out the door. I had my gallbladder out a couple years ago. I try to eat whole foods that are mostly healthy.
I am somewhat a picky eater and my breakfast is quick as I often run late for work. A lot of my meals have some kind of dairy.
I have always struggled with disordered eating. Not a vegetarian but rarely enjoy cooking or eating meat. 

I have on and off been taking the 150mg of feramax. 
I haven't really got my period consistently in years but I am on birth control. We've done tests to rule out anything weird. I only get my period once a year really. Doesn't last long at all. 

I was steadily taking my iron pills everynight for a month and realized later I have silent acid reflux and it caused a flareup. So I can't take them at night. I saw my doctor and told her about how difficult it is to take the iron supplement and she checked and I can take them with all my meds except for my anti-acid one which I now take at night. I take my iron in the morning with my adhd meds now and then bring my breakfast to work and eat it at least an hour or two later. 

I was told I can take the iron supplement three times a week by a walk in clinic doctor and that would be good enough. At this point I'm just fed up and want to get better, I took the iron supplement consistently for the last 6 weeks at least 2 -3 times per week. I was at 20 Ferritin in December and now I'm at 18. I feel like I've taken it the most I have this entire time besides when I took it every night and somehow its down?

It's January/winter in Ontario, Canada and the world is garbage and a lot of other things in my life are difficult and rough. I'm just done and now I think I have to see a specialist which who knows how long that will take to get in. 

I counted my iron supplement bottle and I've in total taken 60 pills of the 150mg feramax since September. Something is definitely up right? Or am I straight up just not taking enough? I also think that my vitamin D probably hasn't changed despite taking the 50,000 UI for the last 6 weeks. Going to ask to check it again. 

I'm just feeling done, frustrated, depressed and messed up over it since finding out my Ferritin is at 18 after being really intentional these past 6 weeks. It was at 20 last time. I've even been trying to incorporate more meat in my diet.

1qgo4gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1qgo4gz/in_between_jobs_while_at_college/,In between jobs while at college,"I, 19 F, transferred universities for spring semester so I could commute from my house. My mom’s requirement for me living in her house while I go to school is that I have to have a job to live with her. So I got a job the same day I finished my finals at my other university. I work at a local coffee shop who knows I’m in college.

I worked there throughout winter break, but the catch is is they only were scheduling me 3-4 days a week for 5 hour shifts at a time. I mentioned I could work more during the break. 

My request to the coffee shop was that I work a maximum of 3-4 days a week since I was in school 5 days a week and I’m going for an engineering degree. 

Fast forward to this week, which is the first actual week of class and they scheduled me 5 days (30 hours). They schedule me as soon as class ends so I don’t get a break at all. I go straight to my car and then head to work. I get home at 9:30 then have to still eat, shower, get ready for bed, meal prep, and do schoolwork. So I only get a few hours of sleep. Anyways, I started thinking about my schedule they gave me. I’m on a weight loss journey and meal prep to help. I’m so frustrated because the more I think about it, the more I realize how little time I’ll have. I’m barely going to have time to take care of myself between working and studying. I’m also in a serious relationship with my partner who’s understanding, but I feel don’t even have time to see him. We make it work but it’s just hard for me to go without seeing him.

Not to mention the fact that every time I work, I end up doing 2 other jobs for people while they sit in the back.. for 11.50 an hour plus tips. 

Anywho, I applied to work on campus because I’m tired of trying to bust my ass to get to work on time as soon as class ends, I’m tired of doing everybody else’s jobs for them after I work my ass off for my degree all day, etc. The dean of engineering at my school literally recommended if we have a job, we either quit or cut our hours because of the rigor.

The other perk of on campus jobs is that I only have to work weekdays. I don’t have a problem with weekends, but I work pretty much every day on the weekend and that’s my family time and time to do my extra schoolwork. 

My mom doesn’t see the problem with me working 30 hours. She doesn’t understand what will happen if I don’t balance school and work. She never went to college. I also would be only making like 10-12 dollars an hour without tips, which is the same that I currently make without the tips (after tips I make 13-18 bucks an hour). If I do get a job on campus, should I take it or keep working for my current job? ",2,1768779760.0,whatdoIdo,1,1.0,False

I’ve had a best friend since the start of high school but we’ve had many ups and downs. For example in senior year she had a bad era where she’d never want to hang out or do anything, was dealing with a bad relationship at the time and pulled away from me a lot. I’ve explained how much this hurt me but she was in a bad mental state and our relationship didn’t improve until the year ended and it was unfortunately never the same.

I went to uni in a different city and she came as well a year later, we only met up maybe twice a year but it was mostly me initiating. At first that really hurt me because this went on for like 3 years but after all that time I finally realized it was okay that she didn’t think we were as close as I thought. It’s not like she didn’t like me or showed me any signs of resentment, it was just that I wasn’t a priority for her and I accepted that. 

Years later we both moved back to our hometown and it was still me asking to meet and her only accepting when the timing was perfect for her but I still didn’t think much of it even though it broke my heart a little. 

I had a big life event last winter and she was a vital part I cannot stress that enough, she was there and did everything she was supposed to do as a best friend and I thought yes we aren’t as close anymore but she shows up when it’s important. During those times, she had a thing with one of my partners friends which then turned sour because the guy was looking for casual when my friend expected more. I tried my best to show support and tried very gently explaining why the guy might have done what he’s done (she tried to look through his phone on the night they met and the guy didn’t appreciate that) I even cut contact with him since he wasn’t a friend of mine and hurt her (which is a given, would’ve done that regardless) 

Then, I got into a school for my masters and was going to move across the world and tried my best to meet her as much as possible (only once she agreed) On that day she spilled coffee on me and I take full blame for this, I didn’t react the best since I had a flight the next morning to see my family one last time before I move. I didn’t yell or anything, just was like defeated and didn’t comfort her that it was okay as much as I normally would have. We then went home and that was that. A few days before my actual flight to another country I tried reaching her but she didn’t answer, after like the 4th text and 36 hours she sent me a long text saying the coffee incident and other small things added up and she wasn’t in a good headspace to meet with me. She also said we could talk on the phone if I wanted and when I saw that text I was flabbergasted. Never would’ve imagined that day could’ve ended our friendship, also I had no idea what other things she meant so I also sent a long text basically apologizing for the latest thing and whatever I’ve done before that as well, saying I never did anything to purposefully upset her and I would love to talk on the phone but it’s okay if she didn’t want to, just to please let me know as I was frantically trying to pack. 

She never answered lol and it’s been over a month still not heard anything. Weirdest friend break up I’ve ever experienced and I think I still can’t fathom that she’s out of my life without even talking to me about any issues she had.

Sorry for not updating sooner, with everything that has happened life is very chaotic right now. I’m going to break this up into two parts so it’s not one very long post.

About a day later I came home and spoke to my wife, apologized and said that if she felt rejected in anyway I’m sorry and that’s really not how I ment it. I told her I was just tired and stupid for not realizing that asking to sleep on the couch would hurt her feelings. She accepted my apology and said she was sorry for pushing me out of bed and that she just got caught up in the moment, then she said she just really doesn’t understand why I like to sleep on the couch.

I told her that I have just always thought it was very comfortable but I promised I wouldn’t sleep overnight on it, maybe just the occasional nap. She asked if I would be ok to get rid of the couch and get a new one, I said that was perfectly fine but asked if she didn’t like the couch then why didn’t she say so before we moved in? She had seen it before so it’s not like she didn’t know what was coming. She said that she saw that I was excited and didn’t want to ruin my excitement.

I told her that I want her to be just as happy as me so she could pick out whatever couch she wanted. That night I called my parents and told them we were getting a new couch, i didn’t explain the whole situation because I thought everything was smoothed over. My mom said that they would take it back because my dad cleaned out the storage room and wanted to make a man cave area.

I went upstairs and told my wife that my parents wanted the couch back and now we could save money by not having to pay someone to haul it off, she said that sounded good and that she had already found the couch she wanted,I said perfect and that she could order it right away.

The next morning I woke up my wife and made breakfast and everything seemed back to normal, I ate, drank coffee and headed to work. That evening I got home around 4:00 and there was a junk removal truck parked in our driveway, I walked inside and noticed that the couch was gone. My wife was in the kitchen so I asked her what was going on and she said “I know you said your parents wanted the couch but I had already called the junk removal guys and would have felt bad it if I canceled” 

I said “what? Why would you do that, now we have to pay these guys to remove something that’s not even junk, and something my parents wanted” she asked why I cared so much about a stupid couch and I told her that this wasn’t about the couch it was about her not telling me about this or not just canceling the junk removal guys. I told her that it just made no sense because we already had everything worked out.",56,1768778705.0,AITAH,52,0.95,False

1qgnmyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhondaPatrick/comments/1qgnmyq/dietary_advice_and_macros/,Dietary advice and macros,"Hi,

  
I've recently discovered Dr Rhonda after not being satisfied with my vegan diet. I went vegan approx 10 years ago after receiving a high cholesterol reading at my annual check up. I managed to get it within normal ranges through a vegan diet. 

Prior to going vegan I had gestational diabetes and PCOS, though I wasn't ever overweight (maybe just a few kgs). 

  
I exercise well (HIIT, slow run and weights) and have 3 children all delivered without issue despite the gestational diabetes (this was managed via diet and not an issue after pregnancy).

However as I'm approaching 50 (now 47) I've not been satisfied with a bit of weight gain, and the following issues with blood tests:

\- low iron and low red blood cells (had an infusion last year)

\- cholesterol is still a bit high

\- urea a bit high

\- fasting blood sugars within range but at top end

  
So it's got me thinking, was my high cholesterol and gestational diabetes caused by too many carbs and unfiltered coffee? It is also really hard to fix the above issues on a vegan diet (can't get iron and protein either). As I age, I know I need more protein.

I've recently started eating fish as Rhonda suggests, eggs and dairy for protein. I've ordered filter papers for my coffee!!

What would she say about a vegan diet (will it cause cancer with all the carbs?), is it impossible to get enough protein? Etc.

What macros should I follow and what sort of calorie deficit should I be in to lose a few kgs? I'm 164cm tall and naturally muscular. What other things should I look out for in cronometer?

What sort of daily meal plan could I follow to improve my markers but just limit it to fish, eggs, dairy (maybe the monthly dose of chicken liver pate for iron!).

Thanks for reading! Perhaps I should become a member of her website too.

I've always thought alcohol stoves were a gimmick. modern isobutane stoves are pretty small, light and efficient. In fact, a single partially used 3.5oz isobutane lasted my partner and I am entire week of coffee and oatmeal in the morning, and tea, soup and freeze dried dinners at night using a Jetboil style Primus stove system. 



So does an alcohol stove make sense? 



Yes and no. 

  
If your bikepacking vs bike touring your food is probably not coming from a restaurant. On bike tours I've actually had food delivered to my campsite via food delivery services. It's unlikely this will work in the Adirondacks even at a campground. 



When you really don't need a stove, alcohol stoves great. In the summer a stove is mostly for morale. A warm meal is soothing but not necessary, especially for a S24O type trip. Hot coffee? Sometimes it's warm enough cold brew is preferable. And isobutane still doesn't come close to alcohol in terms of space efficiency. 



One added benefit is in the Northeast US (especially in the Adirondacks at Stewart's, which is often you best and only guaranteed resupply ) HEET is available to refuel. HEET in the yellow bottle is just methanol and it's pretty efficient. Though my preference is denatured alcohol. 



If I was doing a multi-week long trip through the Northeast (say the Eastern Divide) in summer, being able to refuel would be a huge bonus and on such a trip a stove is slightly more a luxury as the EDT does often pass through towns. Isobutane can also be restocked but typically those tiny 3.5oz Jetboil canisters aren't available unless you resupply at a sports specific store. You can get a big canister at Walmart or other big box stores, but compact canisters are tough to find on the road. And larger canisters take up almost as much volume as an entire alcohol cook kit negating any benefit to the fuel efficiency and ease of a isobutane stove. 

  
Also, if you're flying to a location, you can't fly Isobutane, but worst case, you can find some Everclear at your destination. And it also burns pretty well.

Finally tried the Godiva collaboration at Mister Donut. It was alright, although I expected a deeper chocolate flavour. There's 5 items to the collection and I picked only one, and had another from their regular series - albeit a winter limited flavour. Is it too much sugar in the morning? Definitely. Do I care? Not a bit.

There's a chocolate fair happening at the event hall in Daimaru since 17 January, taking over the previous food fair featuring famous stores around the country. It's the second year I've seen the chocolate fair, and everything looks delicious. Participants include many famous ateliers to more homegrown brands, and even if you aren't buying anything, each vendor is giving out samples galore. Was aware of the fair a few days back but decided to give it a miss over the weekend to avoid the horde of people.

Dismayed to find out that two shops I was looking forward to eating were both unavailable. Might not be making a return, so if anyone is reading this and wants really good omurice in Sapporo, Harunire is the place.

My contingency plan is Hanamaru, a rather popular conveyor belt chain from Hokkaido. The Stellar Place outlet is always packed throughout the day, and wait times can be up to 3 hours (with a ticket you don't have to be physically there). If you're traveling alone or with just another partner, the hack is to opt for the standing area to drastically reduce the wait time. I got in just after 30 minutes. The neta at Hanamaru is very good, although the shari can be better. Still, for a chain sushi restaurant, the overall quality is very respectable. Highlights were the sujiko and hotate, but I also ordered buri, amaebi, botan ebi and salmon. This should be my fourth or fifth visit to Hanamaru, and I have yet to try Toriton and Nagoyakatei.

Bought more scratch cards at the lottery shop in an attempt to win some crazy money before I leave the country. Didn't fare well, so I bought another 10 in spite. Till date I've spent ¥5500 on lottery tickets and only ""won"" ¥1200.

Took a subway out for dinner and stopped at Kikusui. The night scenes of Sapporo, especially those of the quieter areas; are every bit as enchanting as the morning ones. I had dinner at Yu, where they specialize in Tori Paitan. I was the only foreigner in the bustling shop. Soup was rich and well emulsified and the chicken karrage that came with the set nicely fried and juicy. I enjoyed it a lot. Night rounded off at Roquefort for a cup of coffee and cheesecake. Owner was a friend and I've been to the shop several times. He proudly showed me his cute latte art that he did back home. Ambience was really nice and old school. My go-to drink here is the ""Mocha"" beans with nice fruity notes. They don't do espressos here and are cash only.

It's now Day 14 and I'm off to...see a doctor. Something unfortunate came out and I would like to seek a professional opinion. Hope everyone starts their Monday well!",15,1768777812.0,Sapporo,1,0.95,False

Any idea why this might be?

Edit: I feel like this WITHOUT caffeine. I have anxiety but I've been taking meds for some time now and they make everything else better so why has this only been getting worse? And thanks for responding!",1,1768777758.0,TooAfraidToAsk,4,1.0,False
