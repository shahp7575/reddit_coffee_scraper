For some context Zach and I met at work and when there was crazy work drama he stood up for me. We learned how to start IVs together, woke up way too early on the weekends for on call shifts and worked together and he often bought us coffee and breakfast in the mornings. He is nothing short of amazing. His husband Noah is equally amazing. I started house sitting/ dog sitting for them while they went on vacations. They have two very energetic dogs and while their dogs aren’t the best house trained they’re very sweet and usually it’s a good time! 

A few years past and Zach and Noah greeted me into their home as a roomie for one year with really cheap rent to get out of a bad living situation and find better jobs. I paid them monthly, saved money and I was able to move out. Well graciously Zach lent another helping hand and was able to recommend me a job at our current work place and I am endlessly grateful. 

They know I can’t provide as much monetarily wise but I do my best by house sitting often, driving him home from work, texting outside of work and just trying to be there. 

Their dogs are well taken care of, loved a ton and raw fed when they were puppies and always have been. These dogs are a very energetic breed and unfortunately they really love to pull when walking which I believe deters them from going on walks. Additionally our summers are really hot and I don’t notice Zach and Noah playing with them a lot so they have a lot of pent up energy when you get home and jump all over you. Whenever I house sit I do my best to get those pups exercise…. 

For a little more context I usually house sit twice a month for different family’s and a variety of breeds. It’s more like a second job at this point and I really do enjoy it. 

Here is where I might be the ahole….. one of their dogs we will call him Max is the youngest energetic one and was always on the smaller side in regards to weight but still a healthy weight. I had not seen Max and his brother in a good month and half and when I came over to Zach and Noah’s house he looked like he gained 10 or more pounds. 

I said to my best friend Zach, “Is Max okay? It looks like he put on a lot of weight in a short amount of time have you had his thyroid checked before?” I am genuinely concerned about his health. 

I am no vet but I have seen a lot of pups with thyroid issues and sometimes it can be hard to see changes unless it’s from an outside perspective. 

He shrugged it off and mentioned that Noah thinks it’s just fluff. I just moved on past it and said nothing else. 

He has been pretty quiet to me lately after that and I feel like an A-hole. They love their dogs so much and their eating routine and their normal routine of just hanging out hasn’t changed so I never thought it was Zach or Noah. Yeah they could get more exercise but to put on so much weight in 1.5 months makes me think it’s medical related. He might have taken it as me calling them lazy and that’s not he case.

Regardless… am I the A-hole for fat shaming my best friends dog?? ",1,1750543309.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of ceramic poker chips hinges on several critical factors. Let's examine the key features that distinguish premium ceramic chips from inferior ones.

**Material Composition:** Ceramic poker chips are not made of the same type of ceramic as your coffee mug. They are typically constructed from a composite material that includes clay and plastic polymers,creating a durable yet tactile surface. The precise blend of these materials influences the chip's weight, texture, and resistance to wear and tear.Higher-quality chips often utilize a denser, more refined ceramic composite, resulting in a smoother feel and longer lifespan.

**Weight and Dimensions:** Standard ceramic poker chips typically weigh between 9 and 10 grams and measure 39mm in diameter. A consistent weight across all chips in a set is crucial for accurate shuffling and stacking. While subtle variations may exist, deviations exceeding 0.5 grams can substantially impact gameplay. the 39mm diameter is a widely accepted standard due to its pleasant size and ease of handling.

**Edge Spot Design and Clarity:** The edge spots, or colored markings around the perimeter of the chip, are essential for speedy denomination identification. High-quality ceramic chips feature sharp, well-defined edge spots with consistent color saturation. Inconsistent or blurry edge spots can lead to confusion during gameplay,especially when dealing with larger stacks. The intricacy and accuracy of the edge-spot design is a telltale sign of quality manufactuing.

**Surface Texture and Feel:** The defining characteristic of ceramic poker chips is their unique surface texture. The ""sandy"" or ""matte"" feel provides a superior grip and allows chips to slide smoothly across the felt surface. This tactile feedback enhances the overall playing experience. chips with a glossy or excessively smooth surface tend to be slippery and tough to handle.

**Graphics and Inlay Quality:** Most ceramic poker chips incorporate custom graphics or inlays that add to their aesthetic appeal. The printing process and the quality of the inlay material are critical. High-resolution graphics, vibrant colors, and resistance to fading are hallmarks of premium chips. Full-surface graphics, where the design extends to the edge of the chip, are generally considered more desirable than simple center inlays.

**Stackability and Sound:** Premium ceramic chips stack neatly and securely, creating stable towers during gameplay. The sound they produce when stacked or riffled is also important. A crisp, resonant ""clack"" is a highly sought-after characteristic that enhances the sensory experience. Chips that sound dull or muffled often indicate a lower-quality composite material.

Key features of high end ceramic poker chips include:

*   Durable ceramic composite material
*   Consistent weight and dimensions
*   Sharp, well-defined edge spots
*   Matte surface texture for superior grip
*   High-resolution graphics and inlays
*   Excellent stackability and sound

Here's the deal: solar pool heaters aren't just some eco-warrior fantasy. They're legit money-savers that can extend your swimming season by months while keeping your wallet happy. Think of them as your pool's personal trainer – they work hard so you can play harder.

# What Are Above Ground Swimming Pool Solar Heaters?

Above ground swimming pool solar heaters are systems that harness the sun's energy to warm your pool water. Simple concept, brilliant execution. These systems pump your pool water through solar collectors (usually black panels or tubes) where the sun does its magic, then send that toasty water back to your pool.

It's like giving your pool a warm hug from Mother Nature herself. No gas bills, no electric meter spinning like a slot machine – just pure solar power doing the heavy lifting.

The beauty? They work with your existing pool pump, so you're not rebuilding your entire setup. Just add solar panels and boom – you're swimming in luxury.

# Types of Solar Heaters for Above Ground Pools

# Glazed Solar Collectors

These are the luxury sedans of solar pool heaters. Glazed collectors feature tempered glass covers and insulated frames, making them perfect for year-round use in cooler climates. They're pricier upfront but deliver consistent performance when temperatures drop.

Think of them as your pool's winter coat – they trap heat better and work harder when the going gets tough. If you're in a climate where ""summer"" lasts about three weeks, glazed collectors are your best bet.

# Unglazed Solar Collectors

The workhorses of the solar heating world. These systems use UV-resistant rubber or plastic materials without glass covers, making them lighter on your wallet and perfect for warmer climates. They're like that reliable friend who shows up every time – maybe not fancy, but they get the job done.

Unglazed systems excel during swimming season (late spring through early fall) and are way easier to install. Plus, they won't make your HOA lose their minds over ""unsightly equipment.""

# Solar Pool Covers and Rings

Don't sleep on these simple solutions. Solar covers and floating rings aren't full heating systems, but they're the perfect wingman for your main heater. They trap heat during the day and prevent it from escaping at night.

It's like putting a lid on your coffee – basic physics working in your favor. Bonus: they also reduce evaporation, so you're not constantly topping off your pool.

# Why Above Ground Swimming Pool Solar Heaters Are a Smart Investment

# Money in Your Pocket

Here's where things get interesting. Once installed, solar heaters cost virtually nothing to operate. We're talking about cutting your pool heating costs by 50-85% compared to gas or electric heaters. That's not chump change – that's ""extra vacation fund"" money.

Your traditional pool heater is like dating someone high-maintenance – expensive, demanding, and constantly asking for more. Solar heaters? They're the low-maintenance partner who still brings the heat.

# Eco-Friendly Flex

Going solar isn't just about saving money (though that's nice). You're reducing your carbon footprint while enjoying your pool paradise. It's the ultimate win-win – you get to swim guilt-free while your neighbors are still burning through fossil fuels.

**Check details :** [**https://amzn.to/447tcl6**](https://amzn.to/447tcl6)

# Extended Swimming Season

The right solar heating system can add 2-4 months to your swimming season. That means more pool parties, more late-night swims, and more time showing off your pool to friends who are still dealing with ice-cold water.

# Choosing the Right Solar Heater for Your Setup

# Size Matters (Really)

Your solar collector area should be 50-100% of your pool's surface area. Got a 24-foot round pool? You'll need roughly 450-900 square feet of collector area. It sounds like a lot, but remember – bigger collectors mean warmer water and longer swimming seasons.

Don't go cheap here. Undersized systems are like trying to fill a bathtub with a garden hose – technically possible, but painfully slow.

# Consider Your Climate

Living in Phoenix? Unglazed collectors will handle your needs perfectly. Dealing with Minnesota winters? Glazed systems are your best friend. Match your heater to your climate, not your budget dreams.

Think about it this way: you wouldn't wear flip-flops in a blizzard, so don't install the wrong solar heater for your weather.

# Pool Usage Patterns

Are you a weekend warrior or a daily swimmer? Heavy usage means you need more heating power. If you're hosting pool parties every weekend, invest in a robust system that can keep up with demand.

Installation: DIY or Call the Pros?

# The DIY Route

Installing unglazed solar collectors isn't rocket science, but it's not exactly IKEA furniture either. You'll need basic plumbing skills, a decent tool collection, and the patience of a saint. Most systems come with detailed instructions, but ""detailed"" doesn't always mean ""easy.""

Pro tip: If you've successfully installed a garbage disposal without flooding your kitchen, you can probably handle a basic solar heater installation.

# Professional Installation

Sometimes it's worth paying the pros. Complex roof installations, electrical work for automatic controllers, or dealing with tricky plumbing configurations – these situations call for expertise you probably don't have.

Think of it as insurance. Sure, you could perform surgery on yourself, but why risk it when professionals exist?

# Maintenance: Keeping Your System Running Smooth

# Regular Cleaning

Solar collectors need periodic cleaning to maintain efficiency. Dust, leaves, and bird... contributions can reduce performance. A simple hose-down every few months keeps things running at peak performance.

It's like washing your car – not strictly necessary for function, but it sure makes a difference in performance and appearance.

**Check details :** [**https://amzn.to/447tcl6**](https://amzn.to/447tcl6)

# Winterization

If you live where water freezes, you'll need to drain your system before winter. Frozen water in solar collectors is like putting a soda can in the freezer – it expands and breaks things you'd rather not replace.

Most systems include bypass valves that make winterization straightforward. Just don't forget to do it – expensive lesson learned the hard way by many pool owners.

# Component Checks

Inspect your system annually for loose connections, damaged panels, or worn seals. Catching small problems early prevents major headaches later. It's preventive maintenance 101 – like changing your car's oil before the engine seizes.

# Cost Breakdown: What You're Really Looking At

|System Type|Initial Cost|Annual Operating Cost|Payback Period|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Unglazed Solar|$3,000-$4,000|$0-$50|3-7 years|
|Glazed Solar|$4,000-$6,000|$0-$100|4-8 years|
|Gas Heater|$1,500-$2,500|$500-$1,200|N/A (ongoing costs)|
|Electric Heat Pump|$2,500-$4,500|$300-$800|N/A (ongoing costs)|

The numbers don't lie – solar systems pay for themselves through energy savings. After the payback period, you're basically swimming for free (energy-wise).

# Financing Options

Many solar installers offer financing packages that let you start saving immediately. Monthly payments often cost less than what you'd spend on traditional heating, making it a no-brainer financially.

# Maximizing Your Solar Heater's Performance

# Timing Is Everything

Run your solar heater during peak sun hours (10 AM to 4 PM) for maximum efficiency. It's like charging your phone – works better when the power source is strong.

Set up automatic timers so your system runs when the sun's doing its best work. Smart controllers can even adjust operation based on weather conditions.

# Circulation Strategy

Slow water flow through collectors maximizes heat transfer. Think of it like steeping tea – rushing the process gets you weaker results. Your pool pump's variable speed settings are perfect for optimizing circulation.

# Combine Technologies

Pair your solar heater with a pool cover for maximum efficiency. The solar heater warms the water, the cover keeps it warm. It's like wearing a sweater and a jacket – layered protection against heat loss.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

# Undersizing Your System

Going too small to save money upfront is like buying shoes two sizes too small – technically they'll work, but you'll regret it every time you use them. Size your system properly from the start.

# Ignoring Shade Issues

Solar collectors need direct sunlight to work effectively. Installing panels in shaded areas is like trying to get a tan under an umbrella – technically possible, but pretty inefficient.

# Skipping Professional Assessment

Every pool setup is different. Professional assessment ensures you get the right system for your specific situation. It's worth the consultation fee to avoid expensive mistakes.

**Check details :** [**https://amzn.to/447tcl6**](https://amzn.to/447tcl6)

# Future-Proofing Your Investment

# Smart Controls

Modern solar pool heaters can integrate with smart home systems, letting you control heating remotely and optimize performance automatically. It's like having a pool manager who never takes vacation days.

# System Expandability

Choose systems that allow future expansion. Starting with a smaller setup and adding collectors later can spread costs over time while ensuring you get exactly the performance you need.

# Warranty Considerations

Quality solar heaters come with substantial warranties – often 10+ years on collectors and 5+ years on components. Don't compromise on warranty coverage to save a few bucks upfront.

# The Bottom Line: Why Solar Makes Sense

Above ground swimming pool solar heaters represent the sweet spot between performance, cost, and environmental responsibility. They're not just pool accessories – they're investments in extended swimming seasons, reduced operating costs, and guilt-free luxury.

The technology has matured beyond early adopter experiments into reliable, efficient systems that deliver real value. Whether you're looking to cut costs, extend your swimming season, or reduce your environmental impact, solar pool heating checks all the boxes.

Ready to transform your above ground pool from seasonal novelty to year-round oasis? Start with a professional assessment, size your system properly, and prepare to enjoy swimming without the sticker shock of traditional heating bills.

Your future self – the one doing cannonballs in October – will thank you for making the switch to solar. Because the best pool is the one you can actually afford to heat.

Also I am really uneducated about this topic, so I am just asking to learn and discuss a lot more. So, I was going through all of the marvel and related movies, then I stumbled upon Jean Grey. I am not really into the comics much and getting into marvel comics in general feels really daunting so I thought maybe I can ask here. The main reason for this question is because I got mixed answers everywhere I looked. Some say she is weaker than the Beyonder (who comes after The Living Tribunal and TOAA). But then some say that she is stronger than The Living Tribunal. Then some say she is stronger than the One Above All himself because she is technically not the part of the marvel universe (What the hell?).

I mean, most rankings or power scales I have seen, the phoenix force itself is considered among the top 10 most powerful entities but often on the lower side. So I don't understand how a cosmic entity can get even more powerful after finding a host. Normally, every cosmic entity is assigned fixed a amount of power and a role to work upon and handle the cosmos. They are not really anime characters who will unlock the next stage upon need. So how can Jean Grey with Phoenix force (White Phoenix force of the crown) get more powerful than the phoenix force itself?

Also, this is a bit off topic and unnecessary opinion puking (you can skip this if you want). Don't you think making an unnecessarily overpowered character just ruins them? This may be coming from my fatigue and dislike of overpowered characters. But I feel, if you make a cosmos and cosmic entities to handle it, then the cosmic entities and the smaller entities and events should be kept mostly separate. Obviously cosmic entities are going to be the most powerful, and should really stay that way as well because they are the ones handling everything in existence. But I really hate what marvel and DC do in their comics with some of their heroes. And this is seemingly even more ridiculous. A cosmic entity already is equipped to handle and do its share in the cosmos. Making the entire cosmos and its cosmic entities a joke by introducing beings who can think of any power they want or just control the entirety of the cosmos itself. This completely destroys the purpose of cosmic entities and ruins the fun (for me). Jean can literally break and remake universes and timelines. They won't really be able to reverse this by saying, ""Oh, it happened in another universe"". I honestly doubt they can ever use Jean properly now, unless they issue a coffee club of all of the cosmic entities.

Edit: Before anyone says this as I have seen posts about this as well. They can't really show the emotional or human side of her either. Some people argue that they can show how she emotionally handles herself, her human side and her mutant side (which is not really a thing now as she is a almost a god). But the issue is, at that power level, at that position as a cosmic being, you are not really supposed to have emotions. You’ve transcended the human condition. That is a point where you are supposed to be beyond any emotions or material feelings.",1,1750542613.0,xmen,3,1.0,False

since about one month, after making a restart and login with my PW, the screen stays black for about 4:30 min with the mouse pointer being able to be moved. After those minutes of waiting, I'm back to the desktop. It only happens after restart. Rebooting after hibernation, the desktop appears without such prolonged black screen (meaning completely normal). 

Researching the net wasn't successful at all. All found black screen problems and their solutions didn't apply to my case. It seems as if the final booting to the desktop is massively hindered by something during that process, and I don't find any hint to its cause. Maybe it has something to do with one of the latest kernel updates?

It's annoying to wait such a long time for the desktop after restarting. Hopefully there's someone out there having a redeeming idea to solve this behavior?

Thanks in advance!

First of all, thank you very much for all the nice comments you beautiful people left on part 1. This has been a difficult couple of years, and it feels great to see this trial wasn't all in vain. While I was replying to comments on part 1 though, I noticed a misunderstanding that kept popping up.  In part 1, I explained how my boyfriend got better by rediscovering the feeling of fun by trying **new** things —simple, even silly ones, like playing Candy Crush. Yes, he also managed to rediscover the fun of writing stories, but only because he **first** refueled his tank of fun with easier, dumber things, so that he could always stay in his state of flow no matter his level of fatigue or stress. But a lot of people instead understood that you had to find fun in activities you already are doing in your daily life, that you have to somehow change your mindset to feel fun in those drab necessities of life. First of all, sorry for the ambiguity. But as I was replying to comments to fix my mistake, something dawned on me. What if it wasn't a misunderstanding at all? What if it's just something the puer really struggles to do—trying new things?

**Impulsivity**

This is certainly something I noticed with my boyfriend. Anytime I suggested to him to do something or to try to do something new, we argued for hours before I managed to convince him rationally. And even if convinced rationally, he would not do it. He would find millions of reasons to justify not doing it, and if I insisted too much, he would get triggered and aggressive.

I think it has something to do with the impulsivity of the puer. We often think of impulsivity as a sort of impatience. When an impulsive person wants or desires something, he has to satisfy this desire right now. He has a hard time waiting or controlling himself. But there is a flip-side to impulsivity. My boyfriend couldn't try something new unless he first had a desire for it. Even if he knew it was something he needed.

**Meditation**

But somehow we were lucky, as the parents of my boyfriend were into new age stuff, so they teached him meditation and relaxation techniques when he was young. Meditation was not something new that he needed to try, it was something that he already experienced with, that he liked doing, that was part of his identity. And he quickly discovered that meditation allowed him to switch from the puer mindset to the normal mindset. But it was **hard.** He needed seances between 30 minutes and 2 hours every day to switch, depending on how stressed, tired or anxious he was, and that's when he was skilled at it. It was hard to keep it as an habit, as it didn't left him much time to do anything else, somedays it just didn't work, and he would have to start again everytime something stressed or triggered him.

But meditation was a protocol that allowed him to reach a mindset where he sometimes could try new things. It just took us a long time to figure out what the right thing to try was. But now that we know about fun, it takes him 15 minutes of real fun to switch to the normal mindset, what could have taken him 2 hours with meditation. He still meditates, as he still enjoys it and it complements fun nicely, but at least when he is too bored to meditate, he can turn to fun.

**The neuroscience**

We didn't know why meditation worked, in fact, we didn't know why anything we did worked. We just kept reading, kept trying things. I knew him so much I could detect easily when he was in the puer mindset or when he was in the normal mindset, so I used that to figure out what worked and what didn't. But recently I found a video that explained WHY everything we did worked. I don't know why I forgot about it when writing part 1, cause I think it is as important, if not more. It's about recent new scientific discoveries related to the glutamate neurotransmitter, and those scientific discoveries could potentially lead to a big revolution in the fields of psychiatry and psychology in the near future. The video gets quite technical, but the first 10-20 minutes are very exciting. Here's the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6Ft4a0F0ZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6Ft4a0F0ZU)

The science seems extremely solid, but with all my boyfriend's psychological readings, he had never heard of glutamate before. It's recent, but not THAT recent. The video is from 6 years ago, and still we hear very little of glutamate in self-help communities, despite how revolutionizing the science is. The cynic in me thinks it's because no pill that can be sold exists to cure glutamate imbalances, so there is no financial incentive yet to promote, market and advertise the new science to psychiatrists and psychologists around the world. But it's getting near. I don't personally care about pills, I think the science itself can help people a lot.

I just want to clarify that none of this is medical advice. I'm not a professional, I just want to share some interesting science and don't want to promote any particular treatment or medication.

The gist of the video (overly simplified) is this:

\- Glutamate is the most potent and the most omnipresent neurotransmitter in the brain.

\- It is an excitatory neurotransmitter, meaning when a neuron receives glutamate in its receptors, it is MORE likely to fire.

\- It has an antagonist neurotransmitter, GABA, which does the opposite: when a neuron receives GABA in his receptors, it is LESS likely to fire.

\- Chronic stress leads to inflammation in certain parts of the brain which damages the astrocytes and the glial cells of the brain. The affected regions include stress-related parts of the brain.

\- The role of astrocytes and glial cells is to store unneeded glutamate so that it cannot trigger neurons, to deactivate it in a way. If these cells are weakened, it leads to accumulation of active glutamate in the synapses.

\- Clinical trials found that fixing glutamate imbalances with medication too dangerous for public use can cure symptoms of treatment-resistant depression in minutes, compared to the weeks or months previous medications required.

\- Well-regulated glutamate leads to increased synaptogenesis and neuronal plasticity.

The following is not in the video, so maybe I'm wrong or extrapolating too much. But it seems to me glutamate imbalance explains impulsivity, it explains the fear to try new things, it explains the puer mindset. You get impulsive because you have too much active glutamate, which makes some of your neurons more likely to fire, more likely to trigger actions and reactions outside your conscious control. Also, some stress-related regions are particularly affected by that process, which makes you more stressed, and that inhibits the prefrontal cortex, and all that can explain a lot of the behaviors of the puer. Also, the video showed well-regulated glutamate leads to increased synaptogenesis and neuronal plasticity, so it makes you better at learning and trying new things.

Now to go back to my personal experience with my boyfriend, along with meditating, he started doing things that made him feel better. Again, he didn't know why it worked, but it made him feel better, and when he did them, he could reduce the time he needed to meditate, and the positive effects of his meditations lasted longer. He reduced his caffeine intake, he replaced coffee with green tea and he adopted a keto diet. And all of that fits with the glutamate/GABA imbalance framework:

\-> Meditation has been shown to increase inhibition and GABA activity.

\-> Reduced caffeine intake decreases stress.

\-> Quality green tea has been shown to increase the activity of GABA, thus opposing the hyperactivation of glutamate

\-> It has been shown the keto diet cures epilepsy because it better regulates glutamate in some way [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327803002187](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327803002187) . My boyfriend doesn't have epilepsy, but multiple less official sources recommended the keto diet to stabilize brain energy and increase focus, so he tried it, and it worked well for him. Also we kind of know intuitively that children that eat sugar become more excited and impulsive, so I guess maybe just a reduction of carbs and sugars can help a lot.

\-> I don't know if fun fits in that framework, that could maybe be something to explore.

\-> It has also been shown exercise releases a lot of GABA, but that is not something my boyfriend was able to do consistently. But when he did, it did help a lot.

All this to say there is a lot of things that can be tried, and I hope sharing our experience can help a little bit.",2,1750542385.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

He's expressed how shy and nervous he is to meet me and appreciates my patience. He even saw me at a baseball game (I didn't see him as I wasn't really looking around but I do stand out with dyed hair, tats, and piercings so it makes sense why he noticed me) but didn't want to meet when I offered to as I was already out walking around to get a drink. He was really apologetic about it and I said it was okay, and it still is I guess. Neither of us expected to be at the game so I understood as I was a bit nervous at the idea too. 

He doesn't have a car so I think he's embarrassed, too, that he can't pick me up or take me anywhere that isn't local. And I feel like a huge bitch because he goes right home after work to help his family member with medical issues and 100% understand that is top priority and that isn't bothersome to me, I guess I was disappointed we talked for over a month and when I asked if he wanted to go out he said it would be a bit because his mom needed him and the disappointment I felt disgusted me because its selfish and immature.

Every day I grow a bit more anxious he doesn't actually want to go on a date and he'll just stop talking to me. Maybe because I'll bore him or he'll talk to someone better/funnier/attractive or just change his mind that I'm not worth it.

He's the first person to view my insta stories, he's the one who double texted me after I forgot to check Hinge while I was at a convention and asked to keep the conversation going, he says he writes down the coffee shops and places I like to visit... But I can't shake the dread and fear that he'll turn around and ditch me. 

I keep telling myself ""don't bpd this"" as a reminder that it takes patience and time to foster something worthwhile, because I don't want to put him on a pedestal or attach myself to him and then villainize him. 

Any advice? I've suggested maybe we play and online game together two days ago and he said that would be fun and he'd find a game we could play and that hasn't happened either.

90% of my friends say give it time, 10% say he's not going to make the effort..

I don't know what I need to hear or think, is this a normal feeling? Am I being a bitch and getting too emotional? Am I so smitten and obsessed that I can't see a red flag? 😭😭

Edit: if he did ghost me or tell me it wouldn't work I would not beg him to reconsider or harass him. I would respect his decision, I'm not that delusional haha!",2,1750542367.0,BPD,1,1.0,False

The next day I decided to clean my ears with a product for earwaxes and then a loud sound of static was added.

Went to see an ENT doctor. It was awful. He told me my ears were clean, my hearing was good and that I should just not pay attention to the noise. He didn’t even mention tinnitus once.
Talking to Chat GPT would have been more useful and I wouldn’t have cost me 110 euros for a 15 minute session.

I am not a person who asked much in life, I was always happy with what I got.
I never wanted to have a lot of friends or a partner, never wished for a successful life, high paying job nor owning an expensive car.
All I wanted was to be able to mind my own business.

I never smoked nor took drugs, don’t drink coffee, don’t go to concerts or parties, don’t take medication. I wasn’t stressed neither when T appeared because I was on holiday.
Not saying those who got T by doing these deserved it because no one does, not even my worst enemy if they had it.

However I used to listen to music with my headphones a bit too loud for a prolonged time. That was probably the cause. I haven’t used them since the day it happened.

My dream was to own a peaceful place I could call home. To live close to nature and in silence and solitude. Now that I have T, it seems this dream would become hellish.

I used to enjoy drawing in my free time. Now I cannot concentrate on anything so I mindlessly stay on my phone.
I take long walks because nature sounds mask the tinnitus sound but I feel like it’s become louder these past days. I’ve also grown very sensitive and alert to noises, some even hurt my ears.

I know I shouldn’t feel like this but it’s so unfair seeing my brother using his headphones all the time and being just fine. He doesn’t understand my struggle and even trivializes it by saying that I’m just tired etc.
I do not wish it upon him because it’s a terrible condition but I can’t help feeling envious he can live his life while I feel mine is over.

I also cannot use masking sounds at night not in the mornings because we live in a house that doesn’t have any doors so you hear everything and I feel like it would bother him (he wakes up at 12 am).

I try to concentrate on my heartbeat and my breathing instead, telling myself that I will be fine but it’s impossible not to hear the noise. My body now feels very anxious because of the sound even though I try to calm down.
I am the kind of person who has to sleep in complete silence, I can’t believe my peaceful nights have been taken away from me.

I just feel so desperate right now. I hope it’ll get more bearable someday. I don’t loose hope but  I just needed to vent.",5,1750542358.0,tinnitus,3,1.0,False

When opening the bag* i saw something at the bottom some white thing that looked like bones at first. I asked him and he told me it was Sauge*.
He voluntarily gave it to me to burn and rid off bad spirit and negativity.

Same day but later after dinner, i was alone at my place and i was prepared to do it . I’ve burned a small amount of Sauge in each room and i was shouting some religious belief and quotes that i’ve made up at the moment . All that time my door was open to let the spirit* go away.

After that ,nothing much , but one-two days after that . I was SO sick that i called my mom from 1 hour drive to come see me (i live alone) . By the time she was there i was so wet freezing and puking . I was not able to stand up and feeling dizzy/disoriented. Shaking etc. She called the ambulance and it was an emergency for them supposedly from my vitals.

I was check in immediately for free (Canada healthcare)

After numerous test (blood,echo,radio,etc) they didn’t find a thing … i was ‘’alright’’ the day after that.

I’ve lived over a decade in Melbourne, Australia before relocating to Japan over 5+ years ago. During my time there I am friends with hardcore specialty coffee nerds, baristas and even had a small stint as a barista.

Moving to Japan, the specialty coffee scene here isn’t quite the same. The clientele here drinks specialty coffee as a “prestige” or “novelty” drink and majority are in the fast cafe scene like Starbucks, Tullys. The drinks and beans here are priced higher and also as a result owning a good machine at home is “niche” also due to space constraints.

I’ve decided to take the plunge and now have my own machine setup at home but is finding out that I could be the only rare serious home espresso machine owner around. Lucky Coffee Machine initially thinks I was going to run a business.

Buckle up, this is a very long one. Advance thanks for taking the time to read my post and give advice. 

I have an issue with my MIL and would like to get advice on what to do. Important information: we are from Arabic background. 

Back story: I (41f) have been married to my husband (45M) let’s call him A, for 17 years now. 
I have liked my MIL from the day I met her, and when my husband brought with him to my mom house for the first time, I thought she was his older sister as she looked very young. 
I don’t know what went wrong as I have always treated her as my older sister and help her out a lot. 
She help me as more bling to my wedding dress and helped me getting into my dress on the wedding day instead of my own mother. 

My mother died 2 years after I got married in May 2009 with her breast cancer returning for 3rd time and was located in her lungs. My mother was told she had 6 months to live from January 2009, went into coma for 2 months and has made it out to stay in hospital for a month to recover and learn to use her body again. My husband was an Ahole about all this time but I was very young back then (24), naive and didn’t know what to do about it. A story about on my husband may be up soon. 

Now back to MIL. When my mom had made it out her coma and come to stay in a hospice nearby, one day MIL came to visit my mom. Mom asked me to get drinks and when she thought I was out of the room, she had asked MIL to look after me when she was gone as I was 3 months pregnant and I overheard their conversation. MIL seems to avoid to take responsibility but she said ok in the end. 

The DRAMA STARTED FROM THEN!!! She would not come and help me during my pregnancy when I was very anaemic and couldn’t get out of bed one time. I called her and asked her to come and make food for my husband, which is our house her son, and she said she didn’t know how to get to my house. So I explained to her over the phone how to get the bus and come to my place she didn’t went and said she doesn’t know how to use the bus and hasn’t got money for the ticket then I offered her to order her a taxi to bring it to my house because I was desperate. She then said she hasn’t got money to pay for the taxi so I offered call the taxi. Give them the address and pay for the taxi when the taxi driver at my address. She then said sorry I have got laundry to do I can’t come.This was the start of her behaviour. She would repeatedly not be there for me when I needed her the most over the years. 
Many other situations happened and I let it go as when I talked to my husband about it, he would in some occasions start a massive, unwise fight with her and that made her more upset with me. 


Fast forward to the last six months. I found out that my husband was CHEATING on me  with a Muslim woman he met back in April 2024 when he went back to our home country looking to buy a flat for us and continue into I found out at end of September 2024.
From day one I have told MIL and the rest of his family about what is going on. I had decided to forgive my husband and give him another chance because we have three children together and we are Christian and divorce is no easy thing in our community.
I kept mother-in-law in the loop about the things that found on my husband‘s phone, have shown her evidence of him cheating with text messages Facebook post etc, everything I could find to prove that he was cheating. At first she was shocked and horrified by is going on.

All changed in November 2024 when my husband and I got in an mean-less argument (about me having ADHD and find house work difficult) and it snowballed into a massive fight where he packed his bags and I chucked him out of the house, throwing trash after him (with rotten fish) saying take the trash with you because you’re trash. My emotions at that point were very high and a rollercoaster trying to deal with the situation that I found myself in and I was all over the place.
My husband went and hide in his father‘s house (MIL AND FIL are divorced) because he was on holiday. 
A day or two after I cooled down, I went to speak to my mother-in-law and try to find a solution for her to talk to my husband and I was sorry for what happened and for him to come back home.
During our conversation, I told her what happened and how it snowballed. 

Bear in mind, previously MIL was constantly insisting that I leave my husband and that we should not be together, but I said I don’t wanna break up my family and for the sake of my kids and I’m gonna try and keep it together. 

During that conversation, she said that I was overreacting and all men cheat and I should be ok with this and try to keep my family together. (This was also the mentality of SIL in one of my conversations with her because she lived in an Arbic country and her husband was doing the same shit).
I told MIL that cheating is against our Christian beliefs and it’s the one MAJOR sin that shakes God’s throne. 

MIL face changed when I told her that I threw the rubbish at him as he was walking down the stairs.
She started to raise her voice a bit and said that there is no coming back from what I did and that we should divorce. I said then my husband wouldn’t have access to my kids as we come as one package deal! she she said that by law he has the right to and that she would have my kids live with her as my husband as well. By the end of our conversation, she had calmed down and she promised to call my husband and speak to him and update me. 
That night, my FIL was coming back from holiday so my hubby would need another place to stay as he won’t open up to his dad about what is going on. 
I managed to speak to my husband on the phone a couple times on his way back from the airport and informed FIL what was happening but his was in disbelief and denial. By the end of the night we had kinda made up but my hubby said that he needs some time and he will come back when he ready! 

I always had a way of tracking my husband phone via Find My iPhone and other family apps that I had him install after I found out about the cheating. He turned the family app off when he left the house, but somehow didn’t remember to turn off FindMy! 
I knew that he went to stay at his mom house and had told her on the phone that he was on his way to her, she was aware of that I could see his location on findmy app. 
That night something changed, he had turned off his phone. I think he had opened up to MIL and how he was “suffering” living with me because I am not a housewife of his dreams And that the cheating is my fault. 

Next morning, hubby turned his phone on and I tired to catch him before he left to work but was unsuccessful. So I called MIL and said that I am coming to see her! I turned up at her door and she took a while to open up. I could hear her moving things around from behind the door. I walked in acting stupid and asked if my husband had spend the night here or not. She said he didn’t turned up in the end and that he must stayed with someone else. I ask her if she wants tea and I go into the kitchen to myself a drink. She had said that she doesn’t want a drink as she hasn’t had her medicine and coffee yet. Then I found a dirty cup with leftover tea in the sink and told her that is evidence that hubby was here. She acted surprised and said that she fell asleep early, he must got in and left without waking her. 
I acted like I believed her and continued talking to her. Then I asked her if she will continue to support me if her son asked not to talk to me anymore?! She said: I can’t answer that, but the answer is obvious. 
I left her house and then the same day my hubby came home, we talked things out and he stayed very late but would not sleepover. 

In the next couple days, I tried calling MIL and she didn’t answer or got back to me. By that time hubby was sleeping in our home everyday but his suitcases were still somewhere else. 
A week went past and I turned up at her house to see if something had happened to her as sometimes she passes out due to medical condition. 
She open the window from the top floor to talk to me and would not open the door to let me in. 
She goes on claiming that she is upset with me and doesn’t want to have any relationship with me. I kept asking why? She mentioned this: 
- because I brought food one day for my husband while he was staying with her. She says that this is an insult to her. I explained that I didn’t know or mean it that way. That I was thinking of her with her conditions and that it would be hard for her to cook all the time. Plus she doesn’t eat anything else but chicken and that hubby loves beef dish which I have made. 
- she blames me for wanting to kill her self a couple days ago. This is because of all my drama with my husband, her son! I replied: you want to kill yourself and this shit (cheating) isn’t even happening to you, how do you think I feel like. 
However I apologised to causing her pain unknowingly and went on my way. By the end, I thought everything is good and we had made up. 

Then I tried to call her a couple days later and she won’t answer me and has blocked my number because it goes to voicemail after 2 rings. 
I told hubby and he said that I should stay away from her and that she doesn’t want to have any relationship with me. I asked, what about the kids? He said that he will take them to see her and I said absolutely not. My kids don’t like her that much as they has seen that other kids in the family get treated better than them. I have always encouraged my kids and my mother-in-law to form a bond and relationship but it would work for a couple months and die down. 

I reached out around Christmas to MIL via text to see if we would get together or not and no response. When I asked my sister in law who is married to my hubby’s brother if we would see them, she told me that they were not celebrating Christmas this year. Later I went to her house and told her of what had been going on, she wasn’t told or informed by her husband or MIL at all. After this visit, SIL said that we can come Christmas Day for lunch with her parents but MIL will not be there. I have a feeling that she was there the night before and left as when we were on our way. 

Again I reached out at Easter time and no response! I saw her at Easter in church and at the end of Mass, I spoke to her briefly. Asked why she wasn’t answering me and what was going on. 
She said she is no longer upset with me but want nothing to do with me. I said: what about the kids? She said that hubby updated her on them. I said: they are loosing on their only living grandma and eventually they will forget that she exit before she dies. I also told her that my daughter’s friend asked her about her grandparent and my daughter responded that she has one grandma and she passed away (my mom)! 
She said that all the trouble is too much for her. 
I said to her: you should be happy that I managed to keep my family together and did what others before me couldn’t do. 
MIL looked at the floor and said that we should have another conversation another day and not right now in church. 

Since then, I have messaged her to meet up but no response. Caught her on the phone with hubby one time, said hallo and that we would like to see her soon. She brushed it off and said maybe. 

Last week, it was her birthday. I went and bought a gift and went to see her. She was not home, so I called but no answer (not blocked anymore). I left the present at the door, send her a voice note and told hubby to pass the message. Later that evening I get a very short Thank you message from her. 


I think the main culprit is my husband here. I think he gave her clear instructions to stay away as he did with me at the beginning. But couple months ago he said that I could go and speak to her after she got back from our home country. Her daughter was also going to talk to her when she was visiting her back home. 

This DRAMA with MIL is causing me me sleepless night, lots of fighting and agreement with hubby, seeing the pain of my hubby is in because he is stuck in the middle and I just want to confront her, either to rebuild or burn bridges. 
Part of me wanted to confront her for all the shit she has given me in the past and get all that anger out and see how things go after that. 
I think she should be really proud of me for cleaning her son shit up, going to therapy and keeping my family together!

I'm devastated. Any advice?,"This is my first ever post so apologies if it doesn't completely make sense. I [F-31] have been flirting reciprocally with a guy M [M-45, I'm not completely sure] at work for a couple years now. He somehow found out that I play rugby and he loves rugby too. He's French and I'm English so we've always bantered about our national teams playing against each other, particularly during the six nations. He also asks every now and again how my team's season is going. We work at a large department store in our country, him in the supermarket as a baker and me in the accessories department the floor above him as a sales rep/cashier. 
A little back story on me, I've been single for 6 years. I was in multiple relationships in my early 20s one after the other and decided to take some time off for myself after my last boyfriend broke up with me and left me completely shattered. I also haven't been on a single date in almost 3 years, I'd gotten so tired of red flag after red flag. I moved out of my parents house just over a year ago thinking it would also make dating easier but as soon as I got my own space, I didn't want anyone intruding in it, least of all a man. It's just been me and my dog [F, 4, a husky-wolfdog cross] for the past year.
Back to me and M, I finally went to my work's Christmas party last December for the first time after 6 years of working there taking my male best friend as my date (and yes, we looked hot). M and I got to hang out a bit more than just the standard but still flirty ""hi, how are you?"" that we had grown so accustomed to. We even danced together for a few songs. When the next six nations rolled around he asked me if I wanted to bet on the France vs England game, suggesting he wanted a kiss if France won. As I was in my ""loving single life and f*ck men"" stage of my life (which I'm still kinda in) I politely declined which he didn't take personally. We continued with flirty smalltalk and always looking for each other and waved while walking through each other's departments for a few more months. 
Last week I finally decided that I really liked him and was comfortable enough in my life as a single woman so I was going to take a chance and ask him out. Low and behold, England was playing France in a test match soon. So I kept a look out for him at work but didn't see him until very briefly yesterday. I saw him again today in the break room while he was on his lunchbreak and I stopped to get some water. It was the day of the game and we started with our standard small talk and then he asked about my season and how many games I had left (just the 7s finals left in July). I then asked if he was going to watch the game later. Info: he usually finishes working around 2pm and my shift was until 6pm. He said yes and I said I would be working through the game but would try and check the score every now and again. I was then called back to work and left. He messaged me afterwards on our work chat app and asked if I wanted to make another wager, he suggested buying me a red bull which I hate so I asked for a coffee instead. When I asked him what he wanted, he said he wanted a kiss again. Seeing my moment I messaged back saying, that if he wanted a kiss, I wanted a date which he agreed to. He then made it more interesting saying that if England(my team) won, he would get his kiss and if France(his team) won, I would get my date. I agreed, so no matter which team won, we would both be happy. 
After we made our bet we ran into each other again, he had just finished work and I was just finishing my lunch break. He wished me lots of strength for the rest of my shift stroked his hand on my back and kissed me on the cheek. I melted like a teenage girl with her first crush.
I work the rest of my shift while glancing at the game on my phone. France won, so I was getting my date, yes! We were messaging throughout the game and he ""acted"" sad that he wasn't getting his kiss while I reassured him that a date would be so much better. We decided to meet up after his shift in a couple days while I had a day off. He then asked me where I would want to have our date, I didn't know and neither did he. He then asked if I have my own place or if I lived with my parents (I also look very young for my age and people in my country often live with their parents through university, so not a totally weird question). I told him that I have my own apartment with my dog. He asked if he could come to my apartment for our date and I answered, not for a first date. Here's where it happens. He replies, ok but he's married so he doesn't want anything serious. My heart dropped. When I responded, WTF. He replied saying that he thought I knew and he was so sorry. He sent a couple more messages saying how sorry he was and assuming that I didn't want to go on our date anymore. I answered, no I don't think so (I'm very confused right now) and he answers saying how sad he is. Not as sad as me, I reply and he apologises again.
So that's it, after 3 years of not dating anyone I finally make a move on someone I've been flirting with for years and he's married. I'm so upset and so confused. Why did he keep pursuing me or pursue me in the first place? Why did he seem so genuinely interested in my life? Even coming to ask what was wrong when I gave a head wag to his ""how are you?"". How could he seem so wonderful and yet want to cheat on his wife? Was he really just manipulating me the entire time or is there an explanation I'm missing?

I 35M in Ontario currently make 120k a year with a non working spouse & a child that needs extensive care. 

We own a home 460k mortgage remaining, have a car loan and a very expensive insurance because I was involved in an at fault accident. Have to keep the car as I need it for my main 120k a year job that Is hybrid. 

Until two months ago I was doing carpooling and this used to bring in $1000, got banned from the platform as someone complained I took cash and was not accepting ride. ( even though this never happened and I don’t have a recourse to get this enabled again ) 

Between mortgage, car payments, insurance, groceries, property tax, home insurance, I am currently living paycheck to paycheck and feel like an emergency will be the downfall of what I have carefully built all these years. 

I am here to ask the community what are some side hustles that I can do to bring in $1000 extra monthly. 
I tried uber eats and this was less than min wage and didn’t compensate well for the time and effort spent, plus I am in SWO and there isn’t a lot of people ordering via these apps anyway. 
 
edit for budget since everyone’ loves to see the numbers. 

$1450 Bi weekly mortgage 
Property tax $300 monthly 
$500 groceries monthly - vegetarian diet 
$150 hydro monthly 
$95 gas enbridge monthly 
Car payment monthly $819 
Insurance - car -$730 ( cannot bring this down any further as mentioned before one at fault accident ) 
Insurance home - $150, this used to be 115 last year and it went up. 
Two phones & phone lines - $180 - in a 24 month contract. 

Aged dependant Father in India - and his expenses are $500 a month ( rent, insurance, utilities, and grocery ) 

I contribute 300 every paycheck to retirement as my job matches 300 every paycheck as well. 

CCB of $300 is being put into RESP. No compromise here to touch this money decided very early on as we don’t want to look for money when our child needs it. 

I have zero subscriptions, we do not eat out at all, the max I do is get a coffee once when I go to work. Need to commute from London to GTA 2 days a week. 

No credit card or loc debts. 

I get it many of you will suggest my spouse should work and this will be the light at the end of the tunnel, but we have a child that needs care and I have explored options this will be a zero sum game.

TLDR: I’ve got a brand new Linea Micra on the way from Lucky Coffee Machine and would love to know what you do for water supply for your machine? Do you know if Tokyo water has the right minerals and softness? Do you just buy bottled water (and which)?

I’ve lived over a decade in Melbourne, Australia before relocating to Japan over 5+ years ago. During my time there I am friends with hardcore specialty coffee nerds, baristas and even had a small stint as a barista. 

Moving to Japan, the specialty coffee scene here isn’t quite the same. The clientele here drinks specialty coffee as a “prestige” or “novelty” drink and majority are in the fast cafe scene like Starbucks, Tullys. The drinks and beans here are priced higher and also as a result owning a good machine at home is “niche” also due to space constraints.

I’ve decided to take the plunge and now have my own machine setup at home but is finding out that I could be the only rare serious home espresso machine owner around. Lucky Coffee Machine initially thinks I was going to run a business.

Second date: We played mini golf and had ice cream, at the start of the date I tried greeting her with a hug but I either didn’t clarify what I was initiating enough or she didn’t want to do it. That sort of put me off from trying anything physical for the rest of the date. Besides that the conversation was great again, we drove separately and she offered to drive us to get ice cream. 

Third date: We went for a walk, it was a lot quicker than I expected, only lasting around 40mins. She told me before she had a busy day with work in the morning and seeing her friends after, but she still wanted to see me. A little bit less convo as we were walking but it was still a good vibe, we brushed hands and arms a couple times walking, I was thinking about asking to hold her hand but I held off a bit too long and before I knew it the walk was over. We hugged at the end, it was a bit akward and the first time we explicitly broke the touch barrier. I sort of regret not trying to extend the date but it’s said and done now. She talked about seeing me again, she’s going on a vacation next weekend so it’ll probably be over a week before we do. 

Over text she’s always engaged, keeping the conversation going and asking me questions. She suggested mini golf, and also said we should watch this movie together while texting in between the first and second date. Yesterday she commented about how I was putting in a good effort to find a nice walking trail and said it was “so cute”. She’s been a bit more flirty over text, but in person I’ve had a hard time reading her and trying to advance things. I’m a very nervous and shy person when it comes to that stuff as well which has made it hard for me, I’m only really comfortable making a move when I’m 100% she wants to as well which hasn’t really happened. 

Since we’re not going to see each other for a bit I’m planning on texting and asking how she feels about things and how she normally approaches dating so we can both clarify things. Right now the main possibilities are that she’s interested but shy, interested but prefers to take things slow, or not that interested. I think if she wasn’t interested she’d have pulled away by now, but I’m looking for a second opinion to see if my heads in the right place. Thanks!

1lh73k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lh73k9/my_best_friend_is_broke_kind_of/,"My best friend is broke, kind of...","I love my best friend. We have been really good friends for over 8 years and have been through some serious life things together. We have a really meaningful, deep friendship.   
We have a great time together, but I have noticed that since she got married, her lifestyle has gotten smaller and smaller bc her husband always thinks they are 'broke'.   
He is a first-generation immigrant and he grew up poor working with his mom while also going to school. He has a really hard work ethic and is honestly an incredible guy, but he genuinely never feels like they have enough money. It's an extreme case of scarcity mindset.   
For example, I have known times when they have $40k or $70k in the bank, but she will tell me her husband says she can't afford to go out to get a coffee...that coffee is too expensive.   
At first, I was very respectful about it. But then over 6 years, this has evolved to her only being able to go on walks for hang outs because they don't cost any money.   
I had a heart-to-heart with her about it, telling her that it is really hard for me to watch her life get so small and that I want to be able to hang out and do fun things like we used to. She was super receptive and was like, 'I want that too!'.  
But after our initial talk, things just went back to the pattern of 'can't spend any money'.   
I tried to bring it up again, and the second attempt was a more heated conversation and she was basically like, 'You have no idea the fights and conversations we have about this in the home.' She also alluded to him being upset that we once went to get a glass of wine (she bought one glass- less than $20 with tip) because she was spending frivolously. She said that she feels stuck between me and him. I want to do fun things that cost some money (to be clear, I am not rich either and I don't do fancy things..just like normal going to the movies, going dancing, getting pizza on a Friday, etc), and it upsets him if she spends money on those things.   
She told me she wanted to take me out to dinner for my birthday, but couldn't spend more than $50. Unfortunately, $50 doesn't cover 2 ppl for dinner as we live in a very expensive city. 

I love her and I don't want our friendship to end in any way, but I'm kind of at a loss for how to continue being friends while watching her life get smaller and smaller. I am single and I really can't fully understand the struggles of a marriage. I want to be respectful of their marriage, but also I am genuinely watching her become a recluse because her husband is so obsessed with saving money.

What do I do? I don't think I should talk to him about it bc that's not my place. It's clear that this is a big issue and it won't change, at least until he wants it to. 

Do I just keep watching her life get smaller and smaller and not say anything again? I want to stay friends, so I will always go on the walks. But I hate watching her become a fraction of her former self. ",1,1750540680.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

For several months I've had thick mucus in the back of my throat, which progressed to mild dysphagia, globus sensation, occasional hoarse voice and throat clearing, and so much burping. Dr google taught me about LPR and I did 2 14-day courses of omeprazole, plus lots of tums, gaviscon, and reflux gourmet.  Cut out coffee, chocolate, alcohol, tomato, spicy foods. Things are definitely trending better but what's weird is that I now notice occasional mild heartburn or acidic burps. Am I just paying more attention or is it possible that things are healing and I now have sensation back? 

I did have extremely bad heartburn about a year ago, which started on a trip to Africa (I'm a really nervous traveller) and lasted for a few months. But I haven't noticed any until recently, so it's weird that I'm experiencing it now. It's been a couple weeks since I took omeprazole.

Recently, about a month ago, I took a few days off of work and found a nice corner in my favorite coffee shop and threw on some headphones and I flew through a couple different projects; I started and finished a short that I'd been wanting to write for a bit, and started another one, and even wrote a couple pages of treatment for a feature that I'm still hashing out. Problem is, it's certainly not feasible for me to take days off of work all the time in order to pursue these passion projects, so I guess I'm wondering what kinds of things do you all do to make your environment more conducive to allowing yourself into a creative headspace?

I have had multiple viral and bacterial infections including mumps, encephalitis, staph 2x, strep, mononucleosis 2x, numerous bouts of influenza and most recently coronavirus.  I also had endometriosis for many years until I had a complete hysterectomy 20 years ago.  I was always an ambitious, creative person who thrived on setting goals and achieving but I often overexerted whether in school, work, athletics, travel or socializing and then would crash for days or even weeks. Often times in my life I have experienced random pains in my body.  

Even though I am now retired I feel like I never completely recovered from coronavirus last summer.  I often don't sleep well and get up feeling tired.  I can only do one activity in a day and after that I usually have to rest or nap. I have periods when all I want to do is stay in bed for days. I am generally a positive person and have had psychotherapy to address past traumas so I don't really experience depression.  Although I do feel down when I'm not able to do normal day to day activities that others take for granted.

 I have not been diagnosed with CFS but I suspect that I have it given my history of infections and my inability to maintain my energy despite other measures to stay healthy.  I eat a good diet, have a regular sleep routine, practice mindful living, exercise a few times a week, massage, chiropractic and limit alcohol and coffee. I really don't know where to start with getting a diagnosis and does that even matter?  Are there treatments or therapies or life style changes that can help me feel better?

So me (32F) and the devil (30m) have been together for two years, in March, he took me to look at engagement rings after telling both of our families at Christmas that we were going to probably be getting engaged this year. We have lived together for the last two years, and I thought that we were happier than we’ve ever been together.

There’s so many more important details. I simply cannot add here because of the space that’s given. Perhaps I could add in an update or in the comments for more context if needed?

But skipping to the end, he was on dating apps the moment we broke up and I had to watch him get ready to go on dates while I laid in bed and sobbed.

I lost 13 pounds during this month and then on my birthday, he finally told  me that he was having a sexual affair.

Curiosity got the best of me and I looked at his iPad. I did a deep dive into his texts looking for answers and I found out he is currently texting 27 different women and letting them believe that he is available and wants to be with them, he even has told one girl in her early 20s that he’s going to move in with her and run away with her to start a new life and that he’s in love with her. He met her 12 days ago. At the same time he is sending sexual content to another woman and setting up a hook up tonight. I wrote down every phone number and I am going to meet up with two girls tomorrow that used to have dealings with him in the past that I met through the Tea app, they had very similar experiences to mine and they’re going to help me write out what the message should say.

I also have come to believe that he never actually wanted to be with me and he was only ever using me for a cheaper place to stay and because he thought I could help his acting career. one of the girls im meeting up with has Dms from him back when we first moved in together that show he is at least trying to cheat on me. I’m sure once I go public I will have a lot more concrete evidence as to what was actually happening during our relationship.

I’m going to be making a couple of different TikTok videos about the entire situation to make it more public as a warning for the woman he will meet throughout his life. I have poured so much into this relationship, financially, emotionally and I truly bought into the fact that we were in loving, healthy relationship and getting married. I feel so incredibly blindsided, used, and naïve. If I can save other girls from feeling this way and wasting their time and getting their hearts broken, I will consider it worth it. I’m going to be sending a separate message to his friends and family who I have grown very close to since we’ve been dating. I know this will burn a bridge but honestly, it’s a bridge that isn’t mine anymore and if there’s any hope of anyone ever setting him straight, it’s going to be them and not these women that he finds so expendable. Sadly, we’re still currently living together and I have to wait until the day he moves out because I don’t know what the repercussions of this will entail. But I am a woman scorned, he has taken everything from me, and I have nothing left to lose. So enjoy the crash out. I will bid my time over the next few weeks, making a detailed list of who he is with every single day to add to the list of info I’m going to be sending the woman.

Edit: this is my original post. I had to delete it among safety concerns because we were currently still living together. He moved out last Sunday and this morning the messages went out. In total, the number ended up being 42 women, unfortunately, I didn’t get anyone off of dating apps. These were just the women he was texting. 
He had a woman flying in to spend time with him for about a week in the next couple of days and she’s canceled her flight. At this moment The response has been overwhelmingly positive with everyone being very grateful for me to have saved them from what I went through. I am shocked that there has not been one negative things said to me yet. 
I did send out a message to his mom privately to his brother and friends about a lot of his behavior, and I did not get any responses which isn’t surprising, but it’s still disappointing nonetheless. 
I didn’t delete all of our stuff off of Instagram and I went back and change the caption to a warning for the girls that I missed because they weren’t texting him and I already had a girl reach out and tell me that she had plans to meet up with him when she was back in town She has since blocked him and we are currently grabbing coffee when she’s back. 
So far, no word from him. There’s not much to say when I have proof of everything. But I’m sure this is just beginning and I will keep everyone updated as everything unravels. ",46,1750540006.0,revengestories,16,0.98,False

I told myself, I’m going to be in Netflix movies, and visualized it with everything I had. 
I went all out, fully hyped in my imagination. 
I saw myself driving a white Rolls Royce Cullinan and already walking the red carpet.

I like to listen to trap beats while doing this because they help me get into the right energy. 
I kept imagining until I felt a deep satisfaction, like it was already done. Then I let it go and moved on with my day, completely saturated in that feeling.

The next day, I went to my favorite coffee place. 
A guy there was talking about a singer I know, so I joined the conversation. 
He ended up asking me what I do. 
I told him I’m a manifestation coach and choreographer trying to get into the movie industry. 
He said he was a director and producer for Netflix. 
I was shocked. 
I couldn’t believe it, but I instantly knew this was my manifestation.

We talked, exchanged numbers, and planned to meet again for coffee a few days later. 
In the meantime, I did some research on him and found out he’s a big deal. He had produced several award winning Netflix movies.

After our first meeting, something crazy happened. 
As I stepped out of the café, a white Rolls Royce Cullinan was parked right in front of the door. In my city, seeing a Rolls Royce, especially a Cullinan in white, is extremely rare. 
It was the exact image I had in my mind the day before.

At our next meeting, I didn’t beat around the bush. 
I asked him directly if I could work with him, and he was totally open to the idea. 
A few days later, he texted me saying he had talked to his team about me and told them that if a suitable role comes up, they should contact me immediately.

Fast forward, two months from now we’ll be starting our first project together.

All I did was go absolutely crazy in my imagination. 
I saw everything clearly, in full detail, so clearly that no one could have convinced me it hadn’t already happened. 
I saturated my subconscious mind to the point where the outside world didn’t even matter anymore.

I’m not a fan of being stuck on techniques. 
They can be helpful, but you make the rules. 
You should always experiment and discover what works for you.
Play around,be light hearted and have fun,enjoy your life to the fullest in meanwhile!

It went about as well as you can expect. Before this I had been cold turkey clean for about 4 months (after years of hard coffee abuse).

The mild buzz lasted about 6 hours. I felt quite calm and oddly reflective. But even this small amount induced withdrawals. After waking the next day I didn't feel like myself at all. The day felt odd from the start. I was irritable, brain fogged and cognitively closed off. I was social but unable to really sustain any meaningful conversation due the the aforementioned irritability. 

It is roughly 40 hours later and am only now starting to feel better. For me personally, its not worth it at all. Actually in some ways this type of use can be more nefarious as it felt like my motivation was subtly shifted toward a more reactive-impulsive state throughout the withdrawal. Which certainly doesn't do any favors in day to day life.

Pic 1 - maison alhambra. I’m really loving toscano leather and opulence leather toscano is a bit closer to aqua di parma leather which I love. Just got them today. Infini oud is my daily driver these days: inexpensive, lasts and projects beautifully. salvo elixir seriously smells like axe to me. The projection is minimal and so is the duration.

On a side note, I love what they are doing to tom ford. Up yours tommy.

Pic 2: lattafa. I like to play with some of their more femenine inclined aromas (like sublime, honor and glory yara and teriaq) no one’s gonna look at me and confuse me for a lady, and i don’t care either way. 

This collection is also shared with my wife, especially the honor and glory, sublime, teriaq, and yara.

I love oud mood and khamrah. Especially the latter. Insane duration and gourmand notes.


Next I’ll be buying khamrah qawa, kissmet magic, insurrection II wild, eternal coffee, zaffiro collection, bharara king or the baroque satin oud. 

I know. A lot.

Because I’m new, I’m just choosing and picking whatever floats my boat… for example I recently found out what a dupe even was. Opulence leather was just a perfume to me,  not a spit in the face of tom ford’s ombre leather (which I dont mind at all). Worse so, I didnt even know ombré leather was a thing

 does anyone have any recomendations? Maybe you can orient me on what I actually like (for example, I’ve realized I’m really into leather smells, but I like more the leather and fruit clean combo, or leather and tobacco. I’m interested in coffee and alcohol, but I’m worried they wont last.

1lh6py9,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1lh6py9/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

To date, I've generally made my writing habit after full time work, at night, when my kids may or may not be awake - with varying results. I also often use the last 20 mins of my lunch breaks to write as well, usually manage about 300-500 words.

I do generally wake early already, and have been training my body for a few months to do so. I usually exercise first thing, but I'm trying to ""swallow the frog"" and do writing first. This morning I woke at 5.30am, made a coffee and went straight into some free writing. I waffled on but there were a few tidbits that were worthy of saving for future writings.

Then  when I tried to get into my actual novel (currently about 1/3 complete, first draft)... my brain seized up again. I can't tell if it's just because writing in the morning is brand spanking new, or I need more time to let my brain wake up.

Very new into the country, but just wondering the story about coffee over here.
From Ireland originally and lived in Melbourne for a while (out in the countryside not the city). In general walking into a random non-chain cafe in Ireland or NZ the coffee would nearly always range from acceptable to amazing (minimum, always better than any service station or chain spot) 
Meanwhile in New Zealand, the best coffee I’ve had so far was in a night and day shop in Lawrence.
Got a couple grand ones in Dunedin as well… but Queenstown has been terrible. 
I know absolutely nothing about coffee bar if I love or hate the taste. Is there a big difference between how Australia and New Zealand make their coffees/ their taste focus? 
Or have I just gotten unlucky and Queenstown is the worst coffee location of NZ?

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

1lh6ce0,https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/1lh6ce0/i_dont_just_dislike_rdr2_realism_i_hate_it/,I don't just dislike RDR2 realism I hate it.,"I just need to rant about this into the void because I hate, hate, *Hate* everything involved in the realism of RDR2 from it's tedium to it's fans and the fact that apparently GTA 6 will be similar.

This is my 6th or 7th try at playing this game and I am so sick of it. I'm so sick of people telling me how much the realism improved the game it doesn't! It's slow, bland, repetitive time-wasting and you *have* to do it. You have to brush your horse, you have to watch the same gun cleaning animation, you have to watch the same skinning animation, the ssme cooking animation, individually opening every fucking drawer of every cupboard and cabinet and cleaning Arthurs body.

It's not ""gameplay' it's time-wasting, very pretty time-wasting but still slow, methodical, tedious time-wasting. It reminds me of Shenmue but at least Shenmue is a 10 hour game without all the realism. This is a 100+ hour game before any of that. People always rag on JRPG's for being long but fuck man at lesst you're always doing something! Persona doesn't have you actually complete the protagonists homework every night or have you navigate 7 hour conversations over coffee or have me clean the Morganas vomit from the carpet before your surrogate father finds out.

And yet despite the game trying to be this ultra-realistic cowboy game where you have to do this and that and this, feed your horse, don't eat too much, polish your rifle after every gunfight, take a bath, trim your beard, watch your horses balls shrink it will them randomly throw out super unrealistic mechanics for the sake of, ya know, reasonable gameplay. But it's like?? pick a damn side here!

This is a game where if you don't maintain your weapons your guns will be less effective. But you can heal bullet wounds with a tin of baked beans.

A game where you can't hold more than a certain amount of guns. But your horse can carry a Military Surplus and still win the grandchester derby. Not to mention your satchel with more storage space than a DND Bag of Holding.

And when you point this out people tell you ""it's a game. It doesn't have to be realistic. Do you just want to die in one hit? it'd be impossible"" No! No I don't want that and I don't want to have grooming my horse and taking a bath and cleaning my gun after every gunfight to be *mandatory* to be able to play the game properly!

And god the *fans*. Anytime I've ever levied criticism towards RDR2 the fans are so obnoxious. Every single one of them without fail. ""If you don't like it don't play it."" is not a valid argument, it's a GOTY I'm allowed to criticize it. ""It's supposed to be realistic anf immersive"" See above. ""Well maybe you just have 0 attention span"" well maybe I just have better shit to do with my time. You ever think about that? I'm not some ADHD-riddled child who needs a loud explosion every 2 seconds some of my favourite games of all time are puzzles, sandboxes with minimal action like Stray, Outer Wilds and Stardew Valley. The difference is these games are *fun*. They respect your time to play them. They don't make you autopilot a horse for 20 minutes and have you listen to dialogue the entire time to get into a shootout to ride all the way back. It treats. God forbid you do a side mission then you usually don't even get the dialogue to keep your attention. Just follow the purple line and prsy you don't get ambushed by a minigun that instakills you and your horse.

I can spend hours lost in video games listwning to the music and enjoying the sights. I've never needed hyper-realism to do that. 

Fuck this game. I heard GTA 6 will likely have a lot of the same realism to it and if that's the case I'm just gonna save my money. I don't quite fancy having to take a selfie of Jasons abs to post on Instagram before taking his car to the shop to get it's oil changed because you drove it for 2 miles. And if you don't do these things your car gets limited to 30mph and Jasons lack of internet clout locks you out of a whole branch of missions in the 7th chapter.",0,1750538597.0,videogames,49,0.48,False

I started fasting before the test too, I did two 24 hr fasts in a row that week and then normal 16 hr fasts. Then for the day of the test I was only able to fast for 10 hrs. I heard fasting can cause high cholesterol temporarily because my body is using my fat for energy so that’s why it’s concentrated in my blood. But I don’t know how accurate that is.

1lh5zux,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lh5zux,"First-timer around here, already bought too much","My first wall of text reddit post, oh boy. Since there aren't that many women's posts I thought I'd share my thoughts and initial impressions on what I've bought so far.

So only this year did I start getting interested in better quality boots. And wow within the 5 or so months, I seem to have gone on a purchasing spree.. as I have a total of 11 shoes in my collection now welp.  
Granted, almost all my purchases were pre-owned, so I did not pay full-price for any of them.

Shoe size range:  
Women:  7\~8 US (never checked brannock sizing)  
Men: 5.5C US (brannock checked, sized with wool socks)



**Thursday Boot Company**

These three boots were my first purchases.. almost done one right after the other. Jumped in blindly on sizing, lucked out that women 8US fit me. If I were to wear thicker wool socks it's do-able, but a bit snug.  
As most people have mentioned, these are comfortable right from the get go. The colors I shown are black matte, black coffee? (the listing never said so I can only guess..), and dark olive suede.

I have worn these the most so far.

**Meermin**

Dang Meermin's are narrow, I got them in a 6UK and the leather is also quite stiff. Since they're quite a bit slimmer than the Thursday's I plan on wearing them in more formal occasions.

The derby was a bit of an impulse buy, the sizing had me nervous on how small a 4.5UK size would fit for me. In the end, my feet can shove in it if I'm wearing hosiery so that's fine I guess. Annoyingly, they no longer have the product page for this shoe, so this shoe is still a mystery to me.

I have not worn any of these out yet.

**Adelante**

This was when I was in my chelsea hunting phase, and I tried to settle with a bootie style. These two Granada boots I bought have a few scuffs on it, with the caramel looking a little worse for wear.  
I have regrets buying the size 8.5US caramel color. Definitely should've stuck to 7.5/8US, but if I put in a thick insole and it's manageable.  
The smaller 8 I had mistakenly thought it was black, only to open the package and see it was a blue. Which isn't bad, but still surprising.

Ideally I would've preferred a goodyear welted loafer, but I hadn't found any in the price range I was willing to pay, especially since I'm not sure on fit. I decided to try my first blake-stitch with their Sabina in a 7US. It needs a pair of socks with it, but seems to be manageable.

I have not worn any of these out yet.

**Red Wing Shoes**

I hear all about the durability of RW's, so decided to browse around. Found out about Berkley Supply and found some discontinued deadstock of some 1989's in a men's 5US. I had to swing by a RW store, which thankfully there's one like 10 minutes from my house to check my brannock sizing (the guys in there did look at me funny when I mentioned not being in trade, and wanting these as a fashion shoe haha). I love the blacked out 1989 look as it reminds me of sneaker wedges back when they were trendy.

I was sized as 5.5C in men's, and the guys recommended I get a size 5 which I did. Fit has been ok, wool socks are do-able. The only uncomfortable spot would be the back of my legs where the boot collar rubs against my back leg, but it's fine with longer socks.

**Joseph Cheaney**

Another impulse buy, I had heard Cheaney was of nice quality and found these odd pair of Peggy Monkey shoes.

I got this in a men's 4.5UK, and.. the fit is kind of odd. I don't mind the toe space, but the heel is obnoxiously cushioned? Like it raises my heel so much that I don't get a good grip in the heel cup area. I wonder if this is just a case of wearing it more often so it compresses down. They are pretty comfortable, disregarding the slight heel slip from them.

Worn a couple times, I like just slipping them on since they're slightly big.

**TAFT**

Finally, hopefully my last purchase for a while. I found these after a bit of sleuthing. Originally the seller listed the brand as Dainite, which OK I guess they were just looking at the sole and calling it a day. After some sleuthing, I found out this was the Dragon 1.0 in coffee kudu leather in a 6US. Jumped on the deal since it was listed pretty cheap.  
They definitely fit a bit big, and can only wear them with wool socks. I do miss speed hooks too,

Also haven't worn these out yet, probably during the winter.



So my main thoughts after all these shoes?

Man, goodyear welted and higher quality leather does make these shoes quite a bit heavier. And also, my chelsea and knee-boot dreams have still not been realized. Still on the hunt for them, but no rush really since I have all these shoes I just bought..

My total damage from all this was just shy of $600, which isn't too bad for 11 pairs of shoes.  
Maybe I'll do a follow-up after a year or so who knows.",29,1750537637.0,goodyearwelt,10,0.92,False

I'm Lobside (24F), a KC native with a passion for queer media, and I'm looking to connect with others who share that love—especially fellow fujoshi, himejoshi, and anyone who enjoys exploring Queer stories in anime, manga, games, and beyond.

I’m starting a community focused on building friendships and creating safe, fun spaces where we can celebrate the things we love together. My goals for the group include:

Book/Manga Club- Regular discussions around BL, GL, and other queer-centered titles (classic and current), with space for recommendations, deep dives, and fangirling/fanboying.

Watch Parties- Let’s binge anime, films, and dramas—especially those with queer themes, interesting ships, or amazing character dynamics.

Local Meet-Ups in KC- Hangouts where we can connect in person, whether it’s grabbing coffee, visiting local conventions, thrift shopping for merch, or just geeking out together.

Whether you're a seasoned fan or just starting to explore queer media, I want this to be a warm and inclusive space where we uplift one another and share the joy of our favorite stories.

I’m moving to Sector 25, Panchkula in the next two weeks and I’m super excited! I spent part of my childhood in Mohali and always had a soft spot for Chandigarh. My sister is currently studying there, so it already feels a bit like home.

I recently wrapped up 1 year working at a marketing agency in Delhi, and now I’m preparing for my MBA entrance exams. With that in mind, I’m looking to make the most of my time in Chandigarh/Panchkula, both for personal growth and professional connection

Since I’ll be living for a few months, I’d love your help:

1. Gym Recommendations
Any good gyms around Sector 25 Panchkula or nearby where the crowd is motivating and there’s a good vibe? I’m a student (preparing for MBA), so I’m hoping for something decently priced but not shady. Bonus if there’s a bit of a fitness community around it.

2. Networking & Meetups
Since I’m focused on building a career in marketing and preparing for MBA, I’d also love to know if there are any networking events, co-working spaces, or communities in Chandigarh or Panchkula where I might meet like-minded people — especially founders, marketing folks, or even just chill creatives.

3. Hobby Exploration
I’ve also been wanting to learn something new like boxing or MMA — if you know of good places or trainers, hit me up!

And lastly, I’m new here — so if you’re around and open to grabbing a coffee or just vibing with someone who’s figuring life out, I’d genuinely love to connect. Let’s be friends

So today I needed to shave, and while I was in the bathroom shaving, I also needed to use the toilet. My sister apparently spilled something on herself I think she said coffee, but by the time I got in this happened and the thing is I had already been waiting a long time to get into the bathroom because my brother was in there showering. So I said no I just got in her when she asked me to get in, and I guess she complained about it to my mom while I was shaving. I couldn’t hear her fully. Also, I overheard my sister telling my grandma she would drive me to my friend’s house if I needed a ride. Recently my mom had something wrong with her car so I asked my sister she said yes than a few days later. I was told she threw it in my mom’s face, even though she offered. That type of thing seeming to happen all the time. She was mad I’m getting a graduation party after having a birthday party while she couldn’t have both. Even though she didn’t get a graduation party cause our uncle died few weeks before. 

What I haven’t told my family at all is that I’m planning to cut most of them off except maybe a few cousins, my mom, and my brother. I’m going to move to a different state, get married to my girlfriend eventually in the future be quite a while though, eventually have kids, and raise them to be actual good, non-judgmental, emotionally healthy people and how to cope with mental health when they struggle. Because I feel like I’m constantly looked down on and judged by my own family. I made it a life goal of mine to have kids that don’t have the same childhood as me and upbringing I want help create a healthy environment for my children. But then my grandma says I’m just going to end up like my mom smoking and all that. Like I’m gonna end up with a ruined life with no stability and no future. Even though I told my girlfriend I been thinking of going to culinary school to help start our future plans to open our restaurant we been talking about for months. 

But from all of this I’ve carried so much built up anger, depression, and anxiety my whole life, and I think it all stems from growing up in this environment. All my siblings have their own issues, but when I ask for help, even something simple like borrowing money (which I did while still in high school), my sister turns around and blows up at my mom about it. Every time I ask a favor, it becomes some dramatic issue. My mom also when I was kid constantly getting into fights with my grandma about stupid shit. I’ve realized this made me not like being around strangers. I have intense social anxiety, and I truly believe it’s because of how I was raised. I guess I’m scared to be yelled at or judged or getting into an argument with a customer. Because of my family messed me up mentally and I always fight back against them all and it starting to feel natural and I’m scared if I might take that into the real world with me.

1lh5yms,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1lh5yms/my_dog_is_afraid_of_house_noises_at_night/,My dog is afraid of house noises at night,"Hi, I just joined and am looking for help about my rescue girlie fearing the loud house noises at night. 

We’ve adopted her about two years ago and when she first came to stay she used to sleep in my room. But then she developed a fear of the loud noises the house makes during the night, these very loud bang noises that sometimes even scare me a minute. It started with her crying and wanting out of the room-I had a child protector door installed- and I thought at first she wanted night time walks but then one night realized that she just wanted out of the room. We have multiple floors and when we went downstairs, she settled under the coffee table and was fine. We decided to leave her there now because she won’t go upstairs to my bedroom, even in the morning when she comes to wake me up, she’s reluctant to come into the room, she enters, sniffs and wakes me and then dashes out quick. 

These past couple of days I hear her leave her bed in the room with the coffee table and go sleep somewhere else, probably in the living room or kitchen, under a table. I’m really sorry that she’s going through this, she’s fine when we’re around her, and with probably the tv on but once everyone goes to sleep it’s a whole other story. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? I can’t really do anything about the house noises. I thought of getting an air conditioner but not sure if it’d help. 

Unfortunately I’m also short on help from a behaviorist since I haven’t seen one advertised and any kind of special help is so expensive that I can’t currently afford. And can’t really say the vet is much help either, whenever I ask a question about behavior, they usually have no idea, and they only make some vague suggestions.

I’m not sure if leavening her alone is the right choice or if I should try and get her used to coming into my room, I’d really like her to be comfortable at night. Not to mention the fact that I have no idea what this would mean for her if we had guests. Wouldn’t want her to feel like her space is invaded if she were to sleep all around the house/in the living room.

AITAH for complaining about it?,"My (35m) wife (35f) and I have two children (6f and 2f).  Her birthday is in May, which means between her birthday and Mother’s Day it can get a little pricey.  My budget for gifts is between $300 and $500. Typically, my wife will get a gift card to her favorite day spa, a couple of books, maybe an electronic device, balloons, and flowers.  It’s in my budget, but I do spend some time both figuring out what to get her, and making sure our daughters really make sure mom has chore-free days on both days.

In late May I tell my wife a couple of hints for a Father’s Day gift for me, specifically a battery-powered shop vac that uses the same batteries as my drills (it’s an in-house brand from a big box retailer).  While I do have a shop vac, it’s old, bulky, and not battery powered.  In the past my wife has almost always acted on what I suggested for a gift, so I was fully expecting a new shop vac for Father’s Day.  It is what I asked for.

So Father’s Day comes.  I sleep in for a couple hours.  Right after waking up we all have breakfast together that my wife cooked.  And my daughters present me my gifts: a pack of “work” t-shirts, a painted coffee mug, and a Dustbuster from the big box retailer which uses the same batteries as my drills.  Retail cost of $35.  

I could feel my heart sink, and I thought “is this it?”  I spend so much time and money on gifts for my wife, and she doesn’t reciprocate?  I did my best to put in a happy face in front of my kids, but my disappointment was obvious.  After breakfast we go about a usual Sunday, with me doing a handful of chores, and playing with my kids.

That evening, after our kids had gone to sleep, my wife offered me an explanation for the gift: I already had a shop vac, and the Dustbuster would be more useful.  I told her it felt incredibly low effort, well below our gift budgeting, and felt like an insult when you consider the amount of time, energy, patience, and effort being a suburban dad with two daughters takes up.  She said “it is the thought that counts” and left it at that.  It’s been a week, and I feel really no interest in using the Dustbuster, having a conversation with my wife, or even being happy around her.  I feel bummed out that, on the 1 day a year we celebrate being a dad, my wife both completely dropped the ball, and doesnt even acknowledge why I would be upset.  

Icing on the cake is absolutely no intimacy since.  She hasn’t offered, and I haven’t tried.

Owner of Kitty’s Korner at 67 Main Street in Tonawanda.

A lot of people ask me “Why did you open a craft store?”
Truth is — it wasn’t just about crafts.

I opened Kitty’s Korner because I believe in the power of handmade.
Not just to decorate a shelf… but to heal people.
To reconnect us with what matters.
To slow life down for a minute.

I’ve struggled with my health over the years — physically and mentally.
Crafting became my therapy, and this store became my safe place.
Every brush stroke, every bead strung, every cup of coffee with a vendor —
it reminded me that handmade things hold energy, and people need that more than ever.

That’s why I’m picky about what comes in the shop.
I don’t do knockoffs. I don’t resell cheap imports.
I look for people who put love, time, and care into their craft.

When someone walks into my shop and says, “It smells like home” or “This reminds me of my grandma,”
that’s when I know I’m doing something right.

Kitty’s Korner isn’t just a store.
It’s a space to feel better.
To support others.
To make something that lasts.

If you’ve been thinking about getting back into crafting — or you just want to support something real —
we’re here, and you’re always welcome.
