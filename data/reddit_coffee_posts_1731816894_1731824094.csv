1gt78eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1gt78eo/why_my_morning_bs_is_high/,Why my morning bs is high?,"Hi, I'm a newly diagnosed t2, was discovered in early october, been on 2x500mg metformin and 28NE daily insulin (10 in the morning and 18 in the evening), than after a month only 2x750mg metformin since about 1 week.

Dropped sugar completely from my meals and minimized carb intake, I'm eating 5 meals a day regularly with daily exercise, no snacks or any food outside the 5 meals.

Doctor said to measure my bs 4 times a day: before each main meal and before sleeping.

What I noticed is that now my bs is usually high only before breakfast.
It's lower before sleep, but then higher in the morning.

Before dinner: 5.3, 5.4, 5.7 and 5.9 mmol/l
1.5-2 hours after dinner, before sleeping: 5.0, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, wich is always lower than the before dinner measurment.
Than the next day before breakfast: 5.9, 6.0, 5.9, 6.2

By before lunch it's lower again: 5.0, 5.2, 5.3, 5.7

When diagnosed my highest bs was 26, with all day long measurment ranging from 15 to 23.

Now my lovest was 4.9 before lunch and haven't seen any reding over 6.5 since 11.02.

After the diagnosis my meals changed to this:

- 8:30 breakfast is the only time I eat bread now, whole grain with some cold cuts and cheese, 3-4 whole carrots 
- 12:00 snack with a small plate of strawberries or 1 apple or 1 pear, 125gr home made low fat joghurt or cottage cheese, some nuts (peanuts or pistachio)
- 14:30 lunch meat, boiled vegetables (peas, carrot, potatoes) with some dressing sauce
- 18:00 snack almost the same as the one at 12:00
- 20:30 dinner 4 hot dogs, 1 boiled egg, cheese, a bit of vegetables (cucumber or paprika)

Almost only drink water, every 2 or 3 days I drink 2-3 cups of 0 sugar and 0 carb carbonated drink, half a cup of milk for breakfast only on weekends, dropped coffee completely, no alcohol.

At lunch I also take 5000NE d3, chrome, magnesium, b6, organic zinc.

 I still make coffee, but not as regularly as I used to.

My station is divided somewhat evenly into two, with manual brewing methods on the left, and espresso on the right.

I'm not going to spend time listing the equipment because they are all commonly used by us in this reddit channel.

1gt7121,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1gt7121/i_still_bought_him_a_gift_card_lol/,I still bought him a gift card lol,"I met a guy on here and we got to know each other for a year and 7 months roughly. I pretty much fell totally in love with him and delusionally made myself think he loved me too. He broke up with me at the end of September during a conversation in which I confided to him that I was feeling suicidal and hopeless. I still to this day don't understand what I did that was so wrong. It was quite brutal tbh. One minute I was expressing my grief at life and the next he berated me for not ""trying hard enough"" to overcome my depression. Then about a minute later, he hung up and I was blocked. I lost my fucking mind and desperately reached out to him every way I knew how, but I wasn't successful until 3 weeks after the incident occurred. When we finally talked again, he didn't really take accountability for how much he hurt me during that time. He used his poor mental health to excuse ghosting me out of nowhere and made no real attempts to fix anything between us. Despite this, I think he expected us to go back to normal. I stood my ground and tried to force him to care more by being stern and insisting he acknowledge how painful his behavior can be for me at times. It didn't work. He got frustrated that the problem wouldn't just magically go away and decided the best thing to do was ghost me again. So he did and, once again, I lost my fucking mind even worse than before. This time, I could actually feel myself deteriorating mentally, losing all sense of self worth, and experiencing more suicidal ideation than ever. I was fucked up. Not eating, not sleeping, losing hair, massive anxiety attacks, etc. I dealt with this for 3 weeks before I decided that there was no point in trying to get him back and resigned to putting myself out of my misery. As a last ditch effort, I attempted to find his reddit account as it was the last method I could think of to contact him. I somehow managed to find it quite easily and I messaged him without disclosing who I was. After I was sure it was really him, I told him it was me and asked him to please give me closure so that maybe I could stop feeling so dead inside and hopeless about it all. His response was to delete that account. He later sent me an email explaining his situation and kinda saying sorry to which I replied at length. He hasn't said anything else, though. At the beginning of all of this, shortly after the late September ghosting, I bought him a virtual gift card to a coffee shop. I didn't get to send it to him at the time of purchase because I had an issue with it that required customer service. I got that settled and decided that I'd finally send it today despite the fact that I'm essentially being ghosted again. So idk, all of that to say that you might be a fucking loser but no one's a bigger loser than me. 

Anthony, if you see this, the gift card is nonrefundable so please use it. Consider it an apology for how I tried (and failed) to be an important part of your life. 

The sickest part of it all is that I still feel so in love. I recently made the decision to move to Chicago within the next year or so and I should be filled with energy and motivation for that, but everything in my life feels dampened and dull right now. I just wanted to be worth the effort to him. I just wanted to finally get it right with love. Why am I so fucking dumb? ",1,1731822919.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

We had about half of it, and at home I noticed it was getting cold, so I asked him to put it in the fridge (so we could finish it later after reheating it). It's hours later, and I was wondering if I should have coffee or ice cream. He was confused and said ""well, ice cream, cause you told me to throw out the coffee"". I explained in surprise that no I told him to put it in the fridge. He said he would get some Doordashed in the morning (he can't drive), and because everything is closed now. In theory that's a good solution, and it is very considerate. But the way my brain works, I wasn't looking forward to it tomorrow but tonight.

the next scene will make you think of a movie but it really happend haha, i got out of the cafe first she was putting her phone in her purse when out of nowhere she grab my arm, making me turn myself to face her and she just ask me ""we will go trough this together right ?"" rushing into my arms i embrace her clossing my arms giving her a hug as i slowly respond ""yes"" in middle of the crowded sidwalk.

now you have a bit more of context her is the sad end of the dream she was really close with her male best friend she even told me that younger she had feeling for the guy but he rejected her and they want 0 contact since then, i a noticed that she was more on her phone than usual and she confessed to me that they got in touched again, i directly told her that im not fan of that and it make me uncomfortable, she says again that she is with me and he rejected her, so i choose to believe in her and brush it off,

month  passed until holiday come was great did one day with her and her family and one with mine nothing  to say here when i ask her plan about the new year comming her she told me that she would love to do it with me but her girl friend already had plan together so i just let her have some space and even got some nice pic of them all in the street enjoying the firework,

then after the new year i  kinda got a bit curious of her male best friend and looked at his instagram profile and what was my surprise that the first photo comming up on her instagram is a picture of my gf, i dont know why or how but this picture snapped something in me so i talk about it to my gf and ask her if she can talk to me a bit more about his best friend just to know him beetter and not panic over it for nothing,

when she knew i see his instagram profile she got cold by chatting and told me she need time to think about us, it instantly worried me so i ask whats going on and she just ghost me, some days later she call me crying telling me she cant continue with me i was in shock as i just plead her to talk to me that we can try something to make it work, it was like that for a week until she finally decided that we would just go separated ways.

here come the issue its been 2 years since that relationship i dated again to find some compose in all that mess but everytime somthing start to get serious i realize how im not as much in love as i was with my ex and i dont know if i will ever be able to get to something else... im kinda lost after 2 years alone i dont know what to do.

  the reason i input this information is because im not like this, i am relatively stable and incredibly nice, i havent done many drugs and my purview is art. ever since we got together irl everything has taken a steady decline, he constantly wants to do drugs which he hasnt done in over a year and the last time he did was with his drug addicted ex, he has no interest in doing anything including anything tech related which is astounding considering he would drink 8 cups of coffee vigorously working on a project near every night, he wants to isolate himself and often tells his friends he feels ashamed of living. 
  my conclusion is that he misses the spontaneity and bu proxy may subconsciously be comparing me to his exes and realizes im not as spontaneous or risky or smart? and he is realizing hes regretting trading that fulfilling and accomplished life for a cozy, cushy, 9-5 normie life. but he tells me hes always looked up to his friends who have high ranking jobs in the government doing tech things or security related things and hes always wanted to be like them but its difficult because of the job market and doing stuff the normie way is hard. he says it has nothing to do with me and reassures me i am the one thing in his life that doesnt make him want to die constantly but every time i read his messages with his friends that reassurance falls apart and he hides his unhappiness from me. does my conclusion make sense? or does what hes saying make sense too and im too freaked out to be able to let him be upset on his own?",1,1731822569.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

That being said, I am quite paranoid that if I do not remove the battery and try to dry out inner workings with alcohol, I wonder if it will break the laptop.

1. Unplugged the laptop.
2. Turned off the laptop.
3. Dried with a towel.
4. Flipped it into an L shape.
5. After looking at some how-to (2 hours later) remove the bottom cover and have kept it since upside down.

I'm planning to get my parents an espresso machine for Thanksgiving and could use some advice on what to buy.

They only like drinking lattes and don't really like the bitterness of espresso (I tell them to order light roasts in cafes and they prefer that)--in their words, ""my coffee should taste the way espresso smells"". Their lattes are 97% milk (they usually ask the barista for only 1 shot of espresso with 16oz milk, no sugar). Pour over coffee is not their thing. 

I'm looking into a proper espresso machine because they went on vacation and brought home a ton of coffee beans, but I'm also wondering if a Nespresso might just be enough for them.

I worry about you, you are different, since we met I knew that, for the first time in my life I find someone who loves the way I do. This doesn’t happen often, I know I am not easy to love and not everyone’s cup of coffee, but you see me and celebrate me for all those little quirks and oddities that put others off.

You are not this, I see it in your eyes when you see me, I see it when you hold me close while in bed all night long, I see it when you listen to my rants and engage with them. I see it most clearly when you directly tell me you like me, that you want to see me, that I make your time better.

My heart is overflowing with all the emotions it is used to giving away for free, like they are not valuable to guys who prove in one way or another to me that I don’t deserve to be loved, that something is so broken in me and that regardless of how I look outside no one could love someone so wretched and ugly as me.

Any suggestions for small businesses to buy that don't require much experience?,"I have a business now (kennel & pet care) that is extremely overwhelming. It does have the potential to make a lot of $, so I'm currently just stocking up my accounting & tax records to prove the income for a couple of years. I will try to push it out longer if I can handle the stress, this way I can invest some of the savings before moving on to the next thing. If I do tap out early, I want to sell the business and use the profit to buy another business in a location that I actually want to live in long term. But I want out of this specific business and I don't have much experience in other industries. Is something like a coffee shop or a gym difficult to run without experience specific to that industry?

I think I will be able to profit about $500k if I sell in about 2 years. I know it isn't much to retire on, and I am only 33 so not really planning to retire. But I don't need to be rich, I just want a simpler business & life and I'd be happy making just 100k a year. In a perfect world I would push through until I'm about 40, see if it is sellable for more than that and/or continue investing the savings each year. I'm just really not sure I can handle the stress of it until then, so we will see. Just in case I have a mental breakdown, I am preparing to sell it in a couple of years if I need to.

Zyx'tal adjusted his ceremonial assassin's robe in the mirror of his quarters aboard the Verdaxian diplomatic vessel. His iridescent scales shimmered with pride as he reviewed his latest assignment from the High Council. After 147 successful eliminations, this would surely be his easiest yet.

""Computer, display target information again,"" he chirped, his head-crest rising with anticipation.

The holographic display flickered to life:

TARGET: David ""Dave"" Thompson

SPECIES: Human (Sol-3/Earth)

OCCUPATION: Station Maintenance Engineer, Delta-9

THREAT LEVEL: Negligible (Primitive Species)

""A maintenance worker from a gravity-well planet that hasn't even achieved unified planetary government,"" Zyx'tal scoffed, his secondary eyelids blinking in amusement. ""The Council must be joking.""

His assistant AI chirped, ""Warning: Reviewing available data on humans suggests—""

""Cancel warning,"" Zyx'tal interrupted. ""I've heard all the ridiculous rumors. 'Deathworlders' they say. 'Can survive losing entire limbs' they claim. 'Can repair their own broken bones while conscious' they insist."" He waved a scaled hand dismissively. ""Obviously exaggerated tales from lesser species.""

The AI tried again, ""Multiple sources confirm—""

""Enough!"" Zyx'tal's crest flattened in annoyance. ""I refuse to believe a species that still uses combustion engines for planetary transport could pose any challenge. They don't even have proper genetic modification technology!""

He gathered his equipment, carefully selecting his finest toxins and most elaborate traps. ""This 'Dave' character is simply a maintenance worker who somehow convinced the Station Council to allow a primitive aboard. It's practically my duty to remove him before he accidentally destroys something valuable.""

As Zyx'tal boarded his shuttle to Station Delta-9, he reviewed his initial plan. ""I'll start with something simple. Perhaps the neurotoxin from the Crimson Peaks of Vega VII. Even the hardiest species can't survive that.""

The shuttle's AI made one final attempt: ""Sir, regarding humans and toxins—""

""Log entry,"" Zyx'tal announced, ignoring the AI completely. ""Beginning Operation Remove Primitive. Estimated completion time: one standard cycle. Method: Elegant and untraceable. This will be my easiest assignment yet.""

The shuttle docked with Station Delta-9, and Zyx'tal slithered gracefully into the arrival area, his ceremonial robes replaced with standard diplomatic attire. As he checked in with station security, a loud whistling echoed down the corridor.

A pink-skinned biped in a grease-stained jumpsuit walked past, carrying what appeared to be a primitive kinetic energy tool called a ""wrench."" The human was actually whistling an off-key tune while heading toward the station's primary reactor section.

""Excuse me,"" the human paused, smiling broadly at Zyx'tal. ""You look lost. Need directions?""

""No, thank you,"" Zyx'tal replied stiffly, fighting the urge to recoil from the primitive. ""I am quite capable of navigating.""

""Sure thing! Name's Dave, by the way. If you need anything fixed, just give me a shout!"" The human continued whistling as he walked away.

Zyx'tal watched him go, his crest twitching in disbelief. This was his target? This cheerful, disheveled creature?

""This will be over by dinner,"" he muttered, slithering toward his assigned quarters. ""What could possibly go wrong?""

The station's AI, monitoring the exchange, added a note to its logs: ""Probability of amusing events in next 24 hours: 98.7%. Activating entertainment recording protocols.""

Zyx'tal had spent three hours meticulously preparing the perfect scenario. The vial of Verdaxian Fire Extract sat innocently on his desk - a substance so potent it was classified as a Class-1 biological weapon on seventeen different worlds. Even a single drop had been known to dissolve the digestive systems of most carbon-based lifeforms.

He'd carefully crafted his cover story: a diplomatic gesture of sharing his homeworld's cultural heritage. The liquid's deep red color and slight luminescence made it appear exotic enough to pique interest, but not suspicious enough to trigger the station's security protocols.

When Dave arrived at the station's communal dining area for his lunch break, Zyx'tal was ready. He'd positioned himself at the perfect intersection of casual and deliberate.

""Ah, Dave!"" Zyx'tal called out, forcing his crest to remain relaxed despite his anticipation. ""I wanted to thank you for your welcome yesterday. I brought a traditional delicacy from my homeworld to share.""

Dave's face lit up with genuine interest. ""No kidding? That's awesome! I love trying new things. What is it?""

""This,"" Zyx'tal said reverently, removing the ornate vial, ""is the sacred Fire Extract of Verdax Prime. Our warriors use it in coming-of-age ceremonies. Very few species can even handle being in the same room with an open container."" He paused dramatically. ""I wouldn't normally offer it to a... less advanced species, but you seemed friendly.""

Dave peered at the vial with childlike curiosity. ""Neat! Is it like a hot sauce?""

""Hot... sauce?"" Zyx'tal's translator struggled with the concept.

""Yeah, you know, spicy stuff you put on food to give it kick?""

""Well, actually, it's a highly dangerous... I mean, yes, something like that,"" Zyx'tal corrected himself smoothly. ""Though I should warn you, even a single drop has been known to cause immediate sys—""

Before he could finish his warning, Dave had already uncapped the vial and dumped a generous portion over his food cube.

""Wait!"" Zyx'tal's crest stood straight up in horror. ""That's enough to kill a Kraken Beast!""

Dave took a huge bite and chewed thoughtfully. His face reddened slightly.

""Oh man,"" Dave said, grinning, ""this is great! Has a nice kick to it, kind of like a mix between Ghost Pepper and Trinidad Scorpion. Could use a bit more heat though. You got any more?""

Zyx'tal's jaw dropped, his scales turning pale. ""More... heat?""

""Yeah! This would be perfect for the chili cookoff next week. Been looking for something to give my recipe an edge."" Dave proceeded to finish his entire meal, then licked the remaining sauce from his fork. ""Mind if I keep this? I'll bring you some of my chili when I make it!""

""But... but you should be dead,"" Zyx'tal whispered, his crest drooping in confusion.

""What was that?""

""I said... it's all yours,"" Zyx'tal managed weakly.

""Thanks, buddy! You're the best!"" Dave checked his chronometer. ""Oops, break's over. Got a plasma conduit leak to fix. See you around!""

As Dave walked away, whistling again, Zyx'tal slumped in his seat. He pulled out his communicator and made a log entry:

""Day 1, Attempt 1: Failed. Subject appeared to... enjoy the deadliest poison in the Verdaxian arsenal. Note to self: Research 'Ghost Pepper' and 'Trinidad Scorpion.' Possibly new biological weapons? Also, what in the name of the Seven Moons is a 'chili cookoff'?""

In the corner, the station's AI quietly adjusted its entertainment recording settings to maximum quality.

After the humiliating failure of the Fire Extract, Zyx'tal spent two days observing human physiology files, though most were heavily redacted due to humanity's paranoid information control. One fact stood out: humans required constant atmospheric pressure and oxygen to survive. It seemed obvious in retrospect - they evolved on a gravity well planet with an atmosphere, after all.

""Simple problems require simple solutions,"" Zyx'tal muttered as he sabotaged the airlock control panel in Maintenance Section 7-B. His scales rippled with satisfaction as he encrypted the override with a Verdaxian military-grade lockout sequence. Even the station's AI would need hours to crack it.

Right on schedule, Dave's comm badge chirped with the maintenance alert Zyx'tal had fabricated. The human's cheerful voice responded immediately: ""On my way! Probably just those pressure seals acting up again.""

Zyx'tal positioned himself around the corner, secondary eyelids widening in anticipation. As soon as Dave entered the airlock to ""check the seals,"" he would trigger the emergency purge. The human would be exposed to hard vacuum for at least fifteen minutes before anyone could override his lockout.

Dave's whistling echoed down the corridor - today it was something about ""taking the last train to Georgia,"" whatever that meant. Zyx'tal's crest twitched in irritation. Did the human ever stop making noise?

""Hey Zyx!"" Dave called out, spotting him. ""Come to help with the maintenance?""

Zyx'tal froze. This wasn't part of the plan. ""I... was just passing through.""

""Perfect timing then! Could use an extra set of hands. These seals can be tricky.""

Before Zyx'tal could protest, Dave had grabbed his arm and pulled him into the airlock. The assassin's scales went pale as the inner door sealed behind them.

""Now, let's see what's wrong with these... huh, that's weird."" Dave frowned at the control panel. ""System's showing some kind of encryption. Must be a glitch.""

Zyx'tal watched in horror as Dave pulled out his ""wrench"" and popped open the control panel. ""Wait, don't—""

The panel sparked. Warning klaxons blared. The outer door suddenly cycled open, and both of them were yanked toward space.

Dave grabbed Zyx'tal with one hand and a support strut with the other. ""Hang on buddy! Bit of a pressure problem!""

Zyx'tal's ceremonial robes flapped violently as the air rushed past them. His species could survive vacuum for exactly 47 seconds. By his count, they were at 15 seconds and climbing.

""No problem,"" Dave shouted over the wind. ""Just need to..."" He swung them toward the manual override, slammed his wrench against it twice, and somehow hit the exact sequence needed to seal the outer door. The emergency repressurization kicked in.

As atmosphere returned, Zyx'tal lay gasping on the deck. Dave just stood up, brushed off his jumpsuit, and checked his toolkit.

""You okay there? That was a close one!"" Dave helped Zyx'tal up. ""Good thing I've had vacuum exposure training. Though this was way longer than the usual 30-second emergency drill.""

""How... how long were we exposed?"" Zyx'tal wheezed.

""Oh, bout two minutes I'd guess. Not too bad. Had worse during my EVA certification."" Dave was already examining the control panel again. ""Weird encryption though. Almost looks like... nah, couldn't be military-grade stuff out here.""

""Two... minutes?"" Zyx'tal's crest drooped completely.

""Yeah, sorry if that was scary for you. Tell you what - I'm making that chili tonight with your hot sauce. Come by the mess hall, it'll warm you right up!"" Dave patted him on the shoulder and headed out, already whistling again.

Zyx'tal slumped against the wall and updated his log:

""Day 4, Attempt 2: Failed. Subject survived hard vacuum exposure while saving my life. Note: Humans apparently consider two minutes of vacuum exposure 'not too bad.' Additional note: Must research this 'EVA certification.' Final note: I may need to rethink my career choices.""

In the station's security office, three different species were gathered around a monitor, watching the recorded footage and placing bets on what the increasingly frustrated assassin would try next.

After the airlock fiasco, Zyx'tal spent a week nursing his wounded pride and researching more creative solutions. In his quarters, he carefully removed a containment vessel from his diplomatic pouch. Inside, suspended in a stasis field, floated spores from the notorious Mind-Death Fungus of Rigel VI.

""The perfect weapon,"" he muttered, his crest rising with renewed confidence. ""One exposure causes total neural collapse in 94% of known species. The other 6% experience excruciating pain before death.""

The plan was elegant: release the spores into the station's maintenance shaft while Dave worked on the environmental systems. The human would never know what hit him.

Zyx'tal checked his chronometer. Dave always inspected Junction 47 at exactly 1400 hours. He positioned himself near a monitoring station, ready to observe through the security feeds.

Right on schedule, Dave arrived, this time singing something about ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds."" Zyx'tal triggered the remote release of the spores.

The deadly purple cloud enveloped Dave completely. Zyx'tal leaned forward, anticipating the human's imminent collapse.

Instead, Dave paused mid-verse and looked around in wonder.

""Whooooah,"" Dave's voice came through the comm system. ""Dude, Zyx! You gotta come see this! The maintenance shaft is like... breathing colors! And check out these fractals on the power conduits!""

Zyx'tal's crest flattened in disbelief. ""What?""

""The lights are doing this amazing dance thing,"" Dave continued, sounding extremely relaxed. ""Man, this reminds me of that time at Burning Man when... hey, you think the replicator could make some snacks? I'm getting seriously hungry.""

""The deadliest neurotoxin in the galaxy... is giving you munchies?"" Zyx'tal hissed in frustration.

""Oh hey, is that what this purple stuff is? It's awesome! Everything's so... groovy. The quantum harmonics are like... singing to me, man."" Dave chuckled, then added, ""Actually, I think I can see why the power efficiency is down 2%. The patterns are showing me exactly where the misalignment is!""

To Zyx'tal's continued horror, Dave proceeded to make several complex adjustments to the power systems, humming contentedly the entire time. The station's efficiency readings immediately improved to record levels.

""There we go! All fixed!"" Dave emerged from the maintenance shaft, his eyes slightly unfocused but bright. ""Hey, you wanna get some pizza? I'm thinking about ordering like... five of them. With everything. And maybe some of those blue alien cookies from last week?""

""But... but you should be experiencing total neural collapse!"" Zyx'tal sputtered.

""What was that? Sorry, I'm a little distracted by how amazing your scales look right now. They're like, shifting through dimensions or something."" Dave grinned. ""Actually, this is pretty mild compared to that mushroom incident in college. Remember that chili I made last week? That was way more intense!""

Zyx'tal slumped against the wall as Dave wandered off toward the mess hall, now singing about following white rabbits.

Log Entry: ""Day 12, Attempt 3: Failed spectacularly. Target appears to have processed the Mind-Death Fungus as some sort of recreational substance. Station efficiency has somehow improved 23%. Note to self: Research 'Burning Man' and 'college mushroom incident.' Additional note: Consider marketing Mind-Death Fungus as human party drug?""

In the station's security office, the betting pool had tripled in size. The station's AI had started selling highlight reels of the failed attempts, with proceeds going to the station's recreation fund.

Meanwhile, Dave ordered those five pizzas and shared them with the entire maintenance crew, regaling them with stories about the ""totally rad light show"" in Junction 47, completely unaware that he'd just survived his third assassination attempt of the week.

 Chapter 5: ""Gravity Games""

After the psychedelic fungal incident, Zyx'tal had spent three days in deep meditation, trying to understand how everything had gone so wrong. The answer came to him while watching Dave repair a gravity plating malfunction in the cargo bay.

""Of course,"" he whispered, his scales shimmering with inspiration. ""They evolved on a heavy gravity world. Surely extreme gravitational stress would...""

The plan took two days to implement. As Delta-9's newest ""diplomatic liaison,"" Zyx'tal had access to certain station systems. With careful manipulation, he programmed a cascading gravity failure in Engineering Section 12 - Dave's primary workspace.

The trap was elegant: starting at standard 1G, the gravity would increase by 1G every thirty seconds until reaching 15G. Even species from high-gravity worlds couldn't function past 8G without mechanical assistance. At 15G, organic beings typically... well, became much flatter.

""Maintenance alert: Gravity fluctuation in Engineering Section 12,"" the station AI announced right on cue.

""I got it!"" Dave's cheerful voice responded over the comm. ""Probably those new graviton regulators acting up again.""

Zyx'tal watched through the security feed as Dave entered the section. The gravity began its steady increase.

At 3G, Dave merely adjusted his stance. ""Huh, that's odd.""

At 5G, he was moving slower but still functional. ""Reminds me of that centrifuge training!""

At 8G, while Zyx'tal's crest rose in anticipation, Dave actually started doing push-ups. ""Great workout opportunity! Been slacking on my exercise routine lately.""

At 12G, Dave was still conscious and moving, though now crawling along the floor toward the control panel. ""Bit heavy today, isn't it? Good thing I did all that resistance training on Jupiter Station!""

Just before the gravity hit 15G, Dave reached the panel and, with visible effort, managed to override the program. The gravity gradually returned to normal.

Dave stood up, stretched, and cracked his neck. ""Nothing better than a good strength training session! Though the timing was weird - right in the middle of my shift?""

He pulled out his diagnostic tool and frowned at the readings. ""These patterns... they look almost like that encrypted stuff from the airlock incident. Hey Zyx!"" He called out, having spotted the assassin's observation position. ""You're good with computers, right? Come take a look at this!""

Zyx'tal reluctantly slithered forward, his scales slightly pale. ""You... you seem to have handled the gravity increase well.""

""Oh yeah! Not as intense as the training sims, but still fun! Did you know they put us through 20G in emergency procedures training? Something about being prepared for worst-case scenarios during atmospheric reentry."" Dave grinned, wiping sweat from his forehead. ""Though usually I wear a pressure suit for anything above 15G. Safety regulations and all that.""

""Twenty... G?"" Zyx'tal's voice was barely a whisper.

""Yep! Hey, while you're here, want to join me for some low-grav racquetball later? The rec deck has this awesome variable gravity court. Really gets the blood pumping!""

""I... need to go lie down,"" Zyx'tal managed weakly.

""Sure thing! Let me know if you change your mind about racquetball!"" Dave called after him, already back to whistling while examining the gravity controls.

Log Entry: ""Day 17, Attempt 4: Failed miserably. Subject used lethal gravity trap as exercise opportunity. Apparently humans routinely train at gravity levels that would liquefy most species. Note to self: Research 'Jupiter Station' and 'atmospheric reentry.' Additional note: Never accept invitation to human sporting activities.""

In the security office, the betting pool had gone station-wide. Three different gambling rings had sprung up, taking bets on both the next assassination method and Dave's likely positive spin on surviving it.

The station's AI had started a highlight channel called ""Human vs. Assassin: The Failed Files,"" which had become the highest-rated entertainment feed in the sector.

Meanwhile, Dave added ""unexpected gravity workout"" to his daily log and started planning improvements to the station's graviton regulators, completely oblivious to the fact that he'd just survived his fourth assassination attempt while doing calisthenics.

After the gravity debacle, Zyx'tal had done extensive research on Earth's environmental extremes. The data seemed impossible: humans lived in places ranging from -50°C to +50°C with minimal technological assistance. Surely there had to be limits?

His two-phase plan was masterful. First, trap Dave in the cryogenic storage unit, then, after rescue, manipulate the environmental controls in the rescue area to create an instant heat wave. No species could survive such rapid temperature extremes.

Phase one began with a fake maintenance request for the cryo-storage unit. As Dave entered, Zyx'tal remotely sealed the door and dropped the temperature to -80°C.

""Hey,"" Dave's voice crackled over the comm, ""door seems stuck. And it's getting a bit chilly in here.""

Zyx'tal watched through thermal imaging as the temperature plummeted. Dave simply zipped up his maintenance jumpsuit and pulled a knit cap from his pocket.

""Reminds me of ice fishing in Minnesota! Though I should've brought my thermos of coffee."" Dave began humming ""Winter Wonderland"" while continuing his inspection of the cryo-units.

After fifteen minutes at temperatures that would shatter most species, Dave had not only survived but had actually fixed three malfunctioning cryo-pods. ""Found the problem! Someone had reversed the thermal coupling. Easy fix!""

Time for phase two. As soon as Dave was ""rescued,"" Zyx'tal triggered the environmental controls in the adjacent chamber to maximum heat - roughly 70°C.

Dave stepped through the door, still brushing frost off his jumpsuit. ""Whew! Talk about extreme temperature changes! This is like that time I went from an ice bath straight into the sauna after the Siberian Marathon.""

Instead of collapsing, Dave actually started removing layers. ""Perfect timing though - was getting a bit too cold in there. This heat feels great for thawing out!""

""But... but the temperature differential should have sent you into shock!"" Zyx'tal blurted out from his observation post.

""Nah, this is nothing. You should try Death Valley in summer after skiing in Alaska. Now that's a temperature shock!"" Dave stretched contentedly. ""Actually, this reminds me of working maintenance on those volcanic thermal vents in Iceland. Though that was more like 100°C with the steam.""

""You... work in volcanic vents?"" Zyx'tal's crest drooped in disbelief.

""Sure! Great experience for space station work. Extreme environments, you know? Though the pressure suits get pretty uncomfortable above 150°C."" Dave checked his diagnostic tool. ""Hey, the environmental controls are showing that same weird encryption pattern again. We should really get the security team to look into that.""

""I need to... reconsider some life choices,"" Zyx'tal muttered.

""What was that?""

""Nothing. Carry on.""

Log Entry: ""Day 21, Attempt 5: Complete failure. Subject treated lethal temperature extremes as mild inconvenience. Compared -80°C to recreational activity called 'ice fishing.' Referenced casual work in volcanic vents. Note to self: Research 'Death Valley,' 'Siberian Marathon,' and 'Iceland.' Additional note: Humans may be literally indestructible.""

In the security office, the betting pool had expanded to include representatives from three different space stations. A documentary crew had requested permission to film ""The Unkillable Human and His Determined Assassin.""

The station's AI had started selling merchandise, including t-shirts reading ""I Survived Extreme Temperatures and All I Got Was This T-Shirt"" with Dave's smiling face on them.

Meanwhile, Dave added ""check environmental control encryption"" to his to-do list and headed to the mess hall for some hot chocolate, completely unaware that he'd just survived his fifth assassination attempt while performing routine maintenance in conditions that would kill most species.

Zyx'tal had finally cracked it. The solution was so obvious - every species needed rest. Even humans, with their inexplicable resilience to everything else, required sleep. The station's medical database confirmed it: humans typically needed six to eight hours of sleep per cycle.

Perfect.

Over the next three days, Zyx'tal orchestrated a series of carefully timed ""emergencies"" throughout the station. Plasma leaks, atmosphere fluctuations, power grid failures - all requiring immediate maintenance attention. Each one calculated to interrupt Dave's sleep cycle.

By day four, dark circles had formed under Dave's eyes, but he kept responding to each crisis with the same irritating cheerfulness.

""You know,"" Dave said, hanging upside down in a jefferies tube while rewiring a power coupling at 0300 hours, ""this is actually easier than finals week back at MIT. At least these emergencies make sense, unlike quantum thermodynamics at four AM after your sixth energy drink.""

Zyx'tal, monitoring from his usual hidden position, felt his crest twitch. ""You're not even tired?""

""Oh, I'm exhausted,"" Dave admitted, somehow managing to whistle between sentences. ""But this is nothing compared to that triple shift I pulled during the Lunar Base crisis. Now that was rough - five days straight with only power naps between reactor alignments.""

""Five... days?""

""Yeah, good times. Though not as bad as my residency rotation in the Mars Medical Center. Try doing emergency surgery after being awake for 72 hours during a dust storm."" Dave finished the repairs and dropped down from the tube. ""Anyone want coffee? I'm making a fresh pot.""

The next twelve hours brought more ""emergencies,"" but Dave seemed to enter some kind of second wind. By hour 96 without proper sleep, he was actually getting more efficient at repairs.

""It's like being back in college!"" Dave explained while simultaneously fixing three different systems. ""You hit this point where everything gets kind of fuzzy but super clear at the same time, you know? Like that time I wrote my thesis, debugged the station's AI, and won the campus pizza-eating contest all in the same sleepless week.""

Zyx'tal watched in horror as Dave started explaining complex engineering principles to a potted plant while recalibrating the station's main reactor. The worst part? The calibration was perfect.

""Should we... should we call medical?"" a concerned Andromean engineer asked.

""Already did,"" Zyx'tal replied miserably. ""They said his vital signs are 'within normal parameters for a sleep-deprived human' and something about 'impressive alpha wave patterns.'""

Dave wandered past, now having an animated discussion with his wrench about the philosophical implications of quantum tunneling while simultaneously improving the station's power efficiency by 15%.

""Did you know,"" Dave called out to no one in particular, ""that if you look at the reactor core just right, it starts looking like a giant disco ball? Reminds me of that 96-hour hackathon where we reprogrammed the university's entire defense network while having a dance party!""

Log Entry: ""Day 25, Attempt 6: Catastrophic failure. Subject appears to gain new abilities when sleep-deprived. Station systems operating at unprecedented efficiency levels. Note to self: Research 'hackathon,' 'finals week,' and 'energy drinks.' Additional note: Humans may actually become more dangerous without sleep.""

The betting pool had now attracted the attention of several major gambling syndicates. The station's AI had started a new reality show called ""Sleepless in Space: The Dave Chronicles,"" which had become must-watch entertainment across three sectors.

Eventually, Dave crashed for fourteen hours straight, but only after completing every outstanding maintenance request in the station's database, solving three ""unsolvable"" engineering problems, and teaching the station's AI to appreciate jazz music.

When he woke up, he remembered everything perfectly and suggested they schedule regular maintenance marathons, calling it ""just like a fun college all-nighter!""

Zyx'tal seriously considered retiring.

Zyx'tal sat in his quarters, staring at his reflection. His scales had lost their luster, and his crest hung permanently limp. After six failed attempts, he was beginning to question reality itself.

""Computer, confirm: is Dave Thompson actually real?""

""Affirmative. Human life signs detected in Engineering Section 3.""

""Are you sure I'm not hallucinating? Perhaps I've been exposed to some psychotropic compound?""

""Your biological readings are normal, though your stress levels are elevated.""

Zyx'tal had spent the last week researching human vulnerabilities and had finally found something promising. Humans, like all organic life, were susceptible to radiation. The station's medical database confirmed lethal doses for humans were surprisingly low compared to their other resistances.

The plan was simple: sabotage the radiation shielding around the auxiliary reactor during Dave's inspection, exposing him to what the database claimed was ten times the lethal dose.

As Dave entered the reactor chamber, Zyx'tal remotely disabled the shielding. Warning klaxons blared.

""Radiation containment failure,"" the station AI announced. ""Danger: Extreme radiation levels detected.""

""Huh,"" Dave's voice came over the comm, completely calm. ""Looks like the shielding's down. Better fix that before someone gets hurt.""

Zyx'tal watched the radiation readings climb to horrifying levels. Dave just kept working, humming ""Walking on Sunshine"" while making adjustments.

""Hey Zyx!"" Dave called out, somehow knowing the assassin was watching. ""You might want to stay back. The radiation's pretty high in here. Nothing serious for me - reminds me of that summer I spent lifeguarding at the beach. Though I should've brought sunscreen. Getting a nice tan though!""

""A... tan?"" Zyx'tal's voice cracked.

""Yeah, you know, when human skin darkens from radiation exposure? Usually from sunlight, but reactor radiation works too. Though the doctor says I should be more careful after that incident at Chernobyl cleanup site."" Dave continued working, apparently unbothered by radiation levels that would reduce most species to their component atoms.

""Chernobyl?"" Zyx'tal whispered, his reality crumbling further.

""Oh man, what a job that was! Makes this look like a sunny day at the beach. There we were, right next to the elephant's foot, trying to... hey, you okay? You're looking a bit green. Well, greener than usual.""

Zyx'tal had slumped against the wall, his crest completely flat. ""You're not real. This isn't real. I'm in a simulation. Or in hell. Yes, that must be it.""

""Real as they come!"" Dave emerged from the reactor room, his skin noticeably darker and slightly reddened. ""Though I might be peeling tomorrow. Should've packed my SPF 50. At least it's not as bad as that time I got sunburned skiing in Colorado. Now that was radiation exposure!""

""But... the readings... you should be... how?""

""Just another day at the office!"" Dave grinned, checking his reflection in a polished panel. ""Actually, this is perfect timing. I've been meaning to work on my tan before the station's beach party next week. You should come! I'm bringing my famous radioactive chili!""

Log Entry: ""Day 32, Attempt 7: Reality itself has failed me. Subject treated lethal radiation exposure as tanning opportunity. Referenced casual work at something called 'Chernobyl.' Note to self: Research 'SPF 50' and 'skiing sunburns.' Additional note: Considering career change to meditation instructor.""

The betting pool had now attracted the attention of several xenobiologists who were furiously taking notes. The station's AI had started a new fashion trend with ""Dave's Radiation Tan™"" becoming the most requested cosmetic procedure in the sector.

Meanwhile, Dave applied some aloe vera to his mild sunburn and added ""radiation-proof sunscreen"" to his shopping list, completely unaware that he'd just survived his seventh assassination attempt while getting what he called ""a pretty decent base tan.""

In his quarters, Zyx'tal began researching peaceful religious orders that accepted reformed assassins, preferably ones located very, very far from Earth.

Zyx'tal had abandoned all pretense of sanity. After watching Dave survive everything from deadly toxins to lethal radiation with nothing worse than a sunburn and the munchies, he'd reached a conclusion: if Dave wasn't a hallucination, he must be some kind of immortal entity masquerading as a maintenance worker.

The solution? Create a situation so catastrophic that even an immortal couldn't maintain their cover without revealing their true nature.

It took days of preparation. Carefully orchestrated system failures, precisely timed malfunctions, all culminating in what should be a cascade of disasters that would force the evacuation of Delta-9's entire population of 2,473 beings.

The station's AI tried to warn him: ""Sir, these system modifications could result in—""

""Silence!"" Zyx'tal hissed, his crest twitching spasmodically. ""I must know the truth!""

The chaos began at precisely 1500 hours. Primary power failed. Backup systems crashed. Life support started fluctuating. The artificial gravity went haywire, creating pockets of zero-G interspersed with high-G zones. Temperature controls failed section by section.

The station descended into panic. Species from across the galaxy ran for the escape pods. Security teams scrambled. Medical staff rushed to assist the injured.

And there was Dave, moving through it all like he was born for this moment.

""Okay folks, stay calm!"" His voice carried over the emergency channel. ""This is just like that time on Europa Station during the methane storm! Follow the emergency lights to the evacuation zones. Watch out for the gravity fluctuations - treat it like a bounce house!""

Zyx'tal watched in fascination as Dave navigated the chaos. He ran through high-G zones like they were normal, used zero-G sections to quickly move between decks, and seemed to know exactly where every problem was before it became critical.

""Secondary reactor's going critical?"" Dave called out while simultaneously helping an elderly Venusian couple to safety. ""No problem! Just like that submarine incident in the Marianas Trench!""

The station shuddered. Warning klaxons screamed about imminent structural failure.

""Everyone out except essential personnel!"" Dave ordered, now somehow managing to repair three different systems while carrying a scared Andromean child to their parents. ""Don't worry, I've got this! Reminds me of that time in the Amazon when the research station got hit by both a flood and a volcanic eruption during a hurricane!""

Zyx'tal, hidden in his observation post, watched in awe as Dave single-handedly prevented a complete station collapse. The human moved with impossible speed and efficiency, solving complex engineering problems while spouting encouraging words and random stories about even worse situations he'd supposedly survived.

""Almost got it!"" Dave called out cheerfully while hanging upside down in a radioactive, zero-G section with failing life support. ""This is actually easier than that time I had to fix the quantum accelerator during an earthquake while making breakfast!""

Four hours later, the station was stabilized. The evacuated residents returned to find everything not just fixed, but somehow running better than before.

""Well, that was exciting!"" Dave said, covered in grease and sporting another radiation tan. ""Nothing like a good crisis to get the blood pumping! Anyone up for pizza? All this running around made me hungry!""

Log Entry: ""Day 40: Subject cannot be human. No mortal being could... I need a drink.""

The betting pool had evolved into a religious movement, with Dave unknowingly acquiring followers who believed him to be a maintenance deity in human form.

The station's AI had compiled the security footage into an action thriller that became the highest-grossing entertainment product in three sectors.

Meanwhile, Dave filed his shift report: ""Routine maintenance plus some minor system hiccups. Could use more coffee in the engineering break room.""

Zyx'tal, watching Dave cheerfully explain to a group of wide-eyed junior engineers how this was ""no big deal compared to that time on Mars,"" finally accepted that some mysteries in the universe were better left unsolved.

Zyx'tal sat in Delta-9's bar, downing his seventh Rigellian brandy when his worst nightmare appeared.

""Hey buddy!"" Dave's eternal cheerfulness made him flinch. ""Haven't seen you since that crazy system failure!""

""I'm joining a monastery,"" Zyx'tal blurted. ""Far away. Very far.""

""Oh cool! Need help fixing their—""

""NO! I mean... they're allergic to humans. Fatally allergic. Terrible tragedy if you visited.""

""You know,"" Dave grinned, ""I never properly thanked you for all those interesting situations lately. The hot sauce, the gravity workout, that awesome psychedelic light show...""

Zyx'tal's scales went pale. ""You... knew?""

""Well, yeah! The encryption patterns were pretty consistent. Plus, they made action figures of us! Look, tiny vials of 'deadly' hot sauce included!""

Zyx'tal stood so fast he knocked over three chairs. ""My transport leaves now!""

""Want me to send you my radioactive chili recipe?""

The former assassin's scream echoed through three decks as he fled toward the docking bay.

Final Log Entry: ""Day 75: Departing for furthest point from Earth in known space. Still feels too close. Must remember to fake own death if Dave tries to visit. Note to self: Request monastery room without maintenance access.""

The station's AI preserved the security footage of Zyx'tal's departure, particularly his Olympic-worthy sprint when Dave tried to give him a goodbye hug.

Dave kept the action figure on his workbench, occasionally using it to explain proper hot sauce safety protocols to new crew members.

And somewhere in the furthest reaches of space, a former assassin still wakes up screaming from nightmares about cheerful humans whistling while surviving the impossible.

The monastery's maintenance, however, has never been better.

My girlfriend confessed to me that she kissed someone else after our first date. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 3 months. It is both our first relationship and first everything. (At least that's what I thought) Although the first 1.5 months of our relationship started normally, at the end of the 1.5 months we had to switch to long distance due to some problems. Although the transition was difficult at first (at least for me), we managed to get things back on track and everything was going well.

 Today while we were talking on the phone, my girlfriend told me that she wanted to confess something to me but she wasn't sure if she was ready or not. I told her that she could tell me whenever she wanted and that I was always ready to listen to her. After waiting for a while, she told me that she kissed someone else the day after our first date. Even before our first kiss together. I didn't know how to feel after hearing this, but I kept my cool and asked how it was.

 It all started when she forgot her phone at her cousin's house the night before.  The next morning, while her cousin was at a coffee shop on a date, she went to get her phone and after getting it, the guy her cousin was meeting told her that she could call his cousin and they could hang out. And when my girlfriend’s cousin told her this, my girlfriend said yes. When I asked why, she said that she didn’t want to leave her cousin alone. (Her cousin was already there on a date) Then she said that they went to these guys’ house and had a few beers and talked. 

Then the guy my girlfriend’s cousin met agreed to drive my girlfriend and his cousin agreed to drive my girlfriend’s cousin to their house. Then the guy driving my girlfriend asked my girlfriend if she had ever kissed before. My girlfriend said no and that bastard asked my girlfriend if she wanted to try. My girlfriend agreed. When I asked why, she said that we had only met once and that she had gotten carried away. Our first date was magical and very romantic in my opinion. Apparently she didn't think so. Anyway, she told me that she regretted it and kept apologizing. She kept asking me if I was mad but I wasn’t.  I guess I was just feeling disappointed and sad. I didn't want to make a decision based on my immediate emotions and told her we'd talk tomorrow and hung up.

What to do now? What advices can you give? Any help is appreciated.

My girlfriend confessed to me that she kissed someone else after our first date. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 3 months. It is both our first relationship and first everything. (At least that's what I thought) Although the first 1.5 months of our relationship started normally, at the end of the 1.5 months we had to switch to long distance due to some problems. Although the transition was difficult at first (at least for me), we managed to get things back on track and everything was going well.

 Today while we were talking on the phone, my girlfriend told me that she wanted to confess something to me but she wasn't sure if she was ready or not. I told her that she could tell me whenever she wanted and that I was always ready to listen to her. After waiting for a while, she told me that she kissed someone else the day after our first date. Even before our first kiss together. I didn't know how to feel after hearing this, but I kept my cool and asked how it was.

 It all started when she forgot her phone at her cousin's house the night before.  The next morning, while her cousin was at a coffee shop on a date, she went to get her phone and after getting it, the guy her cousin was meeting told her that she could call his cousin and they could hang out. And when my girlfriend’s cousin told her this, my girlfriend said yes. When I asked why, she said that she didn’t want to leave her cousin alone. (Her cousin was already there on a date) Then she said that they went to these guys’ house and had a few beers and talked. 

Then the guy my girlfriend’s cousin met agreed to drive my girlfriend and his cousin agreed to drive my girlfriend’s cousin to their house. Then the guy driving my girlfriend asked my girlfriend if she had ever kissed before. My girlfriend said no and that bastard asked my girlfriend if she wanted to try. My girlfriend agreed. When I asked why, she said that we had only met once and that she had gotten carried away. Our first date was magical and very romantic in my opinion. Apparently she didn't think so. Anyway, she told me that she regretted it and kept apologizing. She kept asking me if I was mad but I wasn’t.  I guess I was just feeling disappointed and sad. I didn't want to make a decision based on my immediate emotions and told her we'd talk tomorrow and hung up.

What should i do? What advices can you give? Any help is appreciated.

He’s stylish, looks about late 40’s-early 50’s, but he is fully grey lol. I haven’t talked to him much because he makes me so nervous, but he has spoken to me a few times.

He comes in about one a week, sits in the cafe to do work on his computer and doesn’t say much except a quick “thank you.” Almost everytime I try to get a quick look, we lock eyes. I’m quite introverted, so I get nervous and look away.

One day about a month ago, I stopped in on my day off to just get out and read a book. I’m sitting alone at the end of a long bench (about 4 tables really close together) that my coworker is wiping down. He walks in, we lock eyes and he waits for her to finish wiping the bench down. He sets his bag down and sits at the table right next to mine. I kept my eyes on my book, but I heard him start talking. He smiled and said, “Sorry, I usually like to give people space, but it’s too hot in the sun.” My heart was beating out of my chest so I just glanced up at him and smiled and said it was okay. He left before me and said bye.

1gt68sf,https://i.redd.it/rfaorn5l9e1e1.jpeg,Prep space by range?,"We just received the first draft of our cabinet plans, and I’d love your input on a few design details:

1.	Prep Space by the Range:
How important is it to have a dedicated prep area next to the range? Right now, the two appliance garages (circled in the plans, added to hide our coffee machines, KitchenAid, etc.) take up most of the counter space in that area. This seems to be a common layout in many kitchens today—so maybe it’s fine? Or would you consider removing the appliance garages, converting them into standard upper cabinets, and reclaiming that counter space for prep work? If we go that route, what would be a better solution for where to place the two coffee machines?

2.	Corner Cabinet Design:
Between the sink and the range, would the corner cabinet be completely impractical if we don’t wrap it around? My husband and I are both tall, so we could access it, but I can see how it might not be ideal. If we wrap it, we gain usability but lose the symmetry, which I really like as it stands.

3.	Lower Corner Cabinet Insert:
Do you have any recommendations for pros, cons, or hacks when it comes to lower corner cabinet inserts? Would a lazy Susan, pull-out shelves, or other options make the most sense for functionality in this space?

Additional Notes:

	•	The open shelves are for our daily plates and cups, a system we currently have and love.
	•	The placement of all appliances needs to remain as is.

For the immediate release capsules, it makes sense that it would be fine to drink coffee an hour after taking the meds but I was wondering if it's different for the extended-release capsules. It takes 7-8 hours for the plasma concentration to peak, so does that mean it takes 7 hours for my body to absorb it? And if that's the case, will the absorption be affected if I drink coffee in that 7 hour period?

I'm also curious, is it possible for it to becomes substantially less effective after a dosage increase? Not just the improvement being smaller, but going backwards, making it worse.

So I've applied for and have gotten into a couple for the choice of English. My dream and passion is film, but you know, born to be an artist, forced to earn a liveable income. So the plan is become financially stable through big law then go back to pursue my passion. (I'm aware big law isn't a walk in the park, it's cut throat and is not a ""fuck around"" type of gig, for context I'm a 4.0 student, high course rigor, bunch of ECs and community service, all that fun stuff) 

I know for law school, really any major is fine, but since any major is applicable I wanted to ask those who are pursuing/already hold these degrees for perspective.

For English, specifically American Literature it's more practical for me. It'll refine the skills I need for success in law school, and I already am pretty passionate for Literature so I know I enjoy studying it and what it contains through past experience. And, biggest of all, I know I'm good at it.

For film, which I technically could pursue as a prerequisite for law school, I think it would make me the most happiest. I'm obsessed with the art of film, but I've never studied it in a ""professional""/academic setting. So it's kind of a shot in the dark;high risk high reward. 

But a lot of people say if you pursue film, prepare to work as a waiter for a good while, because there's not much you can fall back on with. With English, some say you can easily fall back on it with various corporate jobs that require heavy writing/communication, but some say it's the same boat where you'll be stuck pouring coffee for the rest of your life (not that there's anything wrong with that if that's what your into, just not something your hoping for when pursuing a degree)

So based off my personal motivators, and your guys' perosnal experiences with these types of degrees, what would you guys suggest I do, because right now I plan on sticking with English/English American Literature.",2,1731819796.0,college,2,1.0,False

1gt66nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gt66nq/insane_breakthrough_today_with_the_hario_switch/,Insane breakthrough today with the Hario Switch - Worth the experiment.,"Initial apologies as I am not always up to date with this sub - if a similar concept or recipe has been done before I haven't seen it. Probably a good theory reminder anyways.

  
After a full year with dialing in and trying to perfect the 2 Cup V60, I upgraded to the switch last month and started the grind. Obviously it's an amazing brewer and pretty instantly I was getting great results. After trying a few recipes, I noticed a stark leap ahead with Tetsu's ""Devil Recipe"".

If you're not familiar, a really short summary is that you do your initial pours at 93C with the valve open, and then you drop the temperature of your water to about 70C and let the immersion take place (valve closed). I highly recommend you look up Tetsu's video on it or another post in here explaining it. It produced the best cup I've had at home.  
  
I was hungry for more science on it, but everything seemed sort of speculative and unclear to me with varying responses. On the posts here, I found that a very dumbed down answer to my questions about it pointed to the very simple idea that all the stuff in the initial pours = tasted good and everything in the ""body"" pours ends up being a bit trickier. By dropping the temperature and allowing immersion to take place at the end, you end up with a fuller, less bitter body and some good flavors out of the bloom and early pours.  


I went over to a great cafe in my area today - all their baristas are competitive brewers in some forms and all of the drip is done on the spot using the switch. I started talking to them about the devil recipe, and they turned me onto something insane. It's the recipe they use for all their coffees. This particular barista explaining this to me said it is related to Tetsu's method, but enhanced by a few smart ways and it tasted so, so good.  
  
The most simple summarization of it is that it focuses on getting all the good stuff out of the early pours, but instead of reducing the bitterness of the latter pours by temp drop, they do a quick valve open/close at the first pours and brew at a VERY tight ratio (1:8 for all their coffees) and then add water to taste. You end up getting a lot of body by immersion from the first pours + all the good stuff from the early water contact. Then, once you have a very strong, concentrated bit of liquid gold, you reduce it with clean water. Here is a simple version of their recipe:



30G Coffee  
240G Water (1:8)

Water temp should be 94C to 98C

\-Valve open, 80G water to bloom. Wait 30s.

\-Valve open, 80 again - Close the valve when about 1/4 to 1/3 of the water has been drained. Gentle Swirl. Wait 30s. Drain.

\-Exact same pour, 80, close valve mid pour, wait 30s, Drain. 

Now, you have an amazing bit of coffee. It's gonna be strong. Grab a spoon, slurp, and add water to taste.

  
Now about adding water to taste - you can do this to what you usually do, 1:16/1:17, whatever. I do find however, mine end up tasting really good at like 1:14. You really, really, should do it by taste. You'll notice there's sort of a threshold of diminishing return with the water, and you can feel it out in your first few brews. Dependant on the coffee really.

All your standard variables apply (Temp, Ratio, Grind Size etc) so experiment how you please. Also, you can follow the 4:6 method by changing the size of those pours to affect acidity/sweetness/body.

I couldn't even believe I made that cup of coffee. I couldn't believe that there was something better I could do at home than the Devil recipe - a LOT easier too. Happy Brewing Enjoy!!!

1gt6633,https://i.redd.it/132f7k2v8e1e1.jpeg,I explored art from a creative spot for the first time ever.,"Just a quickie from the mind, obviously. 

I don’t know what flair to mark this as, but I wanted to share, as I also love to write. (And yap).
But I’ve never drawn to create.
I’ve tried to begin, but not since I was a kid.
In high school, my freshman & sophomore year schedules, I didn’t get to choose my classes. Only the upperclassmen could. I was enrolled in an “Art and design” course my sophomore year. I almost asked to drop it, from seeing the course title alone.
However, I got to the first class and really enjoyed the teacher. I still channel her now, in my own career working with kids.

Anyway, I liked to paint, and did 3 semesters at an art school when I was 18-19. Dropped out for a variety of reasons, and I have always had the nagging thought that it was a mistake. But I never felt like I was “good enough” at art to really pursue it the way I always wanted to. And when I did try to get into hobbies, I never felt much support. I’ve been going through a lot recently (thanks Reddit, for being my diary) & was bored tonight. Tired of my phone, unable to pay attention to a movie, but didn’t want to read a book, nor sing, or dance.

I paused my movie, and looked at the journal my mother gifted me a few weeks ago, that had sat there on my coffee table, looked at & ignored every night since she gave it to me, not too long after I told her I am an addict & attempting to maintain ‘real’ sobriety (“California sobriety”). I still haven’t used it, although I have been writing a lot electronically.
With that glance, I got up to get a pen. First, I reached for a regular black pen to jot down the thought I had just had— hence the writing at the top of the page lol. I remembered that I have a huge pack of these pens & hurried to grab them before I lost this fleeting moment. When I sat back down, I wrote the statement, intending to do no more. But I stared at the gaping, blank, white space. One ignored page among the 499 other neglected souls.

Just like when I was four years old, I started writing straight lines. And that’s how I used to always start… until I gave up on trying, that is.
But no one ever encouraged me to keep going, past the plain squiggles and lines. As much as I squiggled and practiced straight lines, no one ever encouraged me to go further. But I always wanted to explore art. And I tried. I just… didn’t believe I could be “good”.

Eventually went back to finish a BA, and did stick to art (art therapy) but never much got into drawing. I was scared to be “bad” at it. Kinda like how you get a math problem wrong a few times & decide you are just simply bad at math. I preached the objectivity of art for others, but didn’t let myself live to the same leniency I had given other artists.

Sometimes all we have to do is want to try, and believe that you can. Ask the person out. Dance in your car. Cry during that song you’re singing off-key at karaoke. Go for a hike that seems too long for your skill level. Draw the ugly, lopsided house. Paint a self portrait. Be kind to others & be good to yourself.


This turned into a little ramble… Reddit diary, y’know? But what I’m saying is, draw the fucking drawing. Whatever it is. Don’t think too much about it, or else you’ll talk yourself out of it before you even try.


You never know, you just might end up a mathematician (or an “artist”) after all. Probably art-school-dropout trauma tbh but whatever. So yeah. Tonight I didn’t need outside encouragement. I told myself I should continue and see what happened and I’m so happy I did.


Thanks for reading yall. Blessings.

1gt60ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1gt60ii/i_used_to_love_cheese_ravioli/,I used to love cheese ravioli.,"And, sitting on a park bench happily watching the world swirl past me. 

Don't even bother getting me started on admiring the museum greats... or throwing secret wishes at a full moon. And, oh' the words of the most romantic poets on a candle-lit wintery night. 

Dancing in the rain amidst the rushing city was another favorite. Sometimes, it involved off-key singing or having an amusing swing around the next lamp-post. 

I'd rarely turn down the chance to stroll a secluded path through the woods. It was even better if the path eventually ended somewhere near a summer warmed lake to dip my toes in.

I always loved attending the latest blockbuster in theater. With extra butter on the oversized bucket of popcorn. Or, dressing to the nines to see The Nutcracker or Mannheim Steamroller before driving around admiring the holiday lights. End the night with the playfulness of ice-skating in a dress. *Don't fall down*... it was the best advice, to be applied under any circumstances, really.

Bet you didn't know that I loved making playlists that told the latest chapter of my insignificant life... just because even my story had a theme song. If I'd ever bravely shared the mix, you were probably a significant part of it.

I'd loved cozying up to the bar with a bestie to swap stories about the trials and tribulations of working retail, taking classes, or dating, or just existing. Dear glory... how the poor bartender's ears heard way too many details between casual rounds of flirting.

I used to love laughing at everything. And, even getting to know a random stanger without taking any of it very seriously. 

I'd loved rescuing stray animals and donating hours to charity because I'd never had enough dollars to make any difference. 

I loved dreaming beneath a mountain of fluffy blankets and waking up early enough to have coffee before facing the day. 

I'd loved painting. Still-life, watercolors without enough shadows to escape the second dimension. 

I'd loved old cars and seeing how fast they could still go on an open highway. And, the moment a 737 left the ground... because it vaguely resembled the feeling of going a little too high on the backyard swingset. 

I'd loved you... and the way you somehow managed to infiltrate everything else I had always loved. You were there, entangled in the best, and the mundane, and the very worst. The most memorable (and hopelessly forgettable) day by days had you sprinkled, here and there, like a coat of ineffable star dust. 

I used to love logic and being able to rightfully justify my actions. Clarity and emotion interlinked to make sense of events... I came with an explanation that could usually be comprehended.
I'd loved having my reasons and being able to freely give them.

But, then... it was only you I loved. I didn't know why. Eventually, it turned to an insurmountable pain of everything lost. I couldn't love any of the things the same ever after. 

Until I started over... now, I love blueberry waffles. And, you love her. And, something else, I'm sure. Whatever it be... I hope it's been happiness.

A spacious wooden cabin sits at its center, with another page taped to the front door. It bore a drawing of a circle crossed out with an ex, with the word ""WELCOME"" scratchily written below it. Noah was........ a bit unnerved, to say the least. 

Noah: He must....... REALLY like to show his art, huh?

Uzi gives the door a hardy knock.

Uzi: YO. IS ANYONE IN THERE?

A moment passes before the door slowly creaks open. Pale curled around the edge of the door as a tall, thin, pale figure came into view, wearing a pitch black suit with a bright red necktie. A piercing sense of dread came over Noah as a blank white visage stared down at them.

Noah: Hello............. you from Jersey? 

He did his best to be courteous in spite of the dread weighing down upon his chest. Uzi was surprisingly unfazed.

Uzi: Is Mario here? He said to follow the pages. 

The tall figure cocked his head to the side as he examined the two. He looks into the cabin and beckons someone to come. A more familiar face comes into view.......

Mario: Hey guys! Glad you could make it!

Uzi: Sup, Spaghetti Man. 

Mario: And I see you've met my old pal, Slenderman.

The pale figure gives a friendly wave as he ushers the two in. They head to the living room where they see many of their friends hanging out and enjoying their stay here. Gangle and Melony are chilling out on the couch while Whisk, Whimpu, and Saiko have a little chat by the fireplace. Well, it isn't really a chat so much as Saiko letting Whisk talk about her findings from those Enochian ruins. Whimpu seemed much more invested.

Whimpu: A statue made of fluorescent sodalite?

Whisk: Yeah! I always thought it was just tiny stones like the ones over at Lake Superior, but that statue was a single piece over 10 feet tall! 

We also see Pomni, Meggy, and Shiro playing some party games. Meggy decides to show off some of her dexterity skills with some Five Finger Filet, having the tip of a knife dance swiftly and elegantly between her fingers as she picks up the pace before coming to a full stop. She takes a deep breath and flips the knife's handle towards Shiro. 

Meggy: Try beating THAT. 

Shiro cautiously claims the knife and sets his palm down on the table. He holds still for a moment, but not out of hesitation. You could practically hear the gears turning in his head. He's up to something, and Pomni saw it.

Meggy: You good there, buddy?

In a flash, he grabs Meggy's wrist and presses her hand back on the table.

Meggy: GAH! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?

Shiro flashes her a mischievous glare with a chuckle.

Shiro: I accept your challenge. 

And he begins. His starting pace had already surpassed Meggy's final speed. She shrieked in terror, desperately trying to hold her hand still less she lose a digit or two. Shiro remained laser focused on the task at hand. His hand was a blur as the successive taps of the knife's edge grew faster and faster until it became a long droning sound. Pomni just looked on, trying to contain her laughter as Meggy panicked while Shiro was zoned in. Finally, he flips the knife into the air and plants it directly between Meggy's middle and ring fingers. She sits there in a moment of shock, whereas Pomni could no longer hold in her laughter. Meggy didn't know whether to be scared, angry, or impressed, and you could tell Shiro had the biggest s*** eating grin under that mask.

Shiro: Try beating that. 

Uzi and Noah make their way towards the TV. A split screen game of Halo Reach Slayer has Belle's panties in a twist as a well placed heads hot ends the game in Tari's favor. 

Noah: Is your friend okay? 

Belle angrily punts the controller, narrowly missing Noah as it goes flying across the room and directly into Mario's head. The force of the impact literally imbeds the controller into his skull. Mario doesn't seem to notice, though.

Mario: I'm-a hungry. 

Mario's Brain: I think I just s*** myself. 

Tari: Belle! What have we said about throwing controllers that aren't ours?

Belle: OH PISS OFF.

She storms outside to the back patio to cool off, rattling the room when she slams the door.

Noah: I see. 

Tari: Sorry about that. Playing games with her can get a little heated sometimes.

Tari hops up to her feet. 

Tari: So, what made you decide to come?

Noah: Mrs. Mildenhall said I could have the night off after doing such a good job at the Café.

The truth is that Martha needed something to keep him busy while they fixed the coffee machine. Something in it broke and it would only produce this RAINBOW MAGIC instead of normal coffee, something Noah was not aware of as he served the stuff to several customers. Chaos quickly ensued.

Tari: Glad to hear, Noah! Also, you have a little something on your shirt.

She points to the gaping hole in the side of his uniform. The edges were stained black with oily ichor. 

Uzi: That was my fault. Sorry. 

Outside on the patio, Belle takes another puff of her cigarette. She had finally managed to cool down after that last heated match. She could've won if she hadn't relied too much on her Armor Lock. Either way, there was no point in moping about it now. She was about to head back inside when she saw something moving in the brush. Whatever it was, it stumbled into tree with an audible thud before landing itself into a nearby bush. It's quiet for a moment. A now curiously concerned Belle hops down from the patio.

Belle: Oi. Who's there?

No reply, apart from some heavy breathing. She cautiously draws her pistol as she approaches the bush. Back inside, Noah and Mario are watching some Netflix while Tari and Uzi are over on the couch. Slenderman is there too as he examined the mark on Uzi's hand.

Uzi: I haven't done much besides moving things around and...... I haven't really looked into it much beyond that. 

He signs ""When did it first appear?""

Uzi: My last birthday. Somewhere over half a year ago. 

Behind him, a pair of tentacles draw a picture of the mark in a notepad, carefully mirroring his hand movement as he traces his finger over Uzi's hand. 

Uzi: Any ideas on what it is?

Mario: I'm not saying it was aliens but......

Tari: Mario, what does this have to-? 

The backdoor slams open. The whole room turns to see Belle carrying a battered and funky smelling trashman into the room. 

Belle: Alright, everybody move! 

Meggy: Wait, I'd that BOB? What's he doing over here? 

He's barely conscious when Belle lays him down on a nearby couch. He doesn't appear to be hurt, just exhausted. There's also this odd stench that's exceptionally different from his normal garbage musk. 

Meggy: Give him some space! Tell me what happened.

Belle: He just stumbled out of the woods. Probably s***faced by the looks of it. 

Meggy: I don't know, Belle. I've seen Bob when he's drunk and it's NOTHING like this. 

Noah: Maybe he's just had a long day. 

Tari: Maybe Last I heard, Bob said he was heading over to Boopkins' place to help with something. 

As they wait for Bob to calm down, Tari sees a piece of paper in his pocket. She takes the piece, and she unfurls it to reveal a short note. The handwriting was distinct from Slendy's so it couldn't be one of his pages. A chill creeped up her spine as she reads Boopkins' handwriting. All it said was.......

I just got home from a very long, stressful day at work, and my dog is super excited to see me. I greet him and then immediately greet my husband. While greeting my husband, my dog was still super excited (tail wagging, trying to get my attention). My dog accidentally knocked over a glass that was on the coffee table nearby. The glass didn’t break but the contents were spilled. My husband’s immediate reaction was to smack my dog in the face. Immediately I freaked out and shouted, “why the fuck would you smack him?” and my husband says “it wasn’t that hard, he didn’t feel it.” I heard the impact- granted the dog didn’t scream or yelp, but still, what the fuck. It’s not like he did it on purpose, he’s a dog!!! I was so upset, I removed myself and my dog from the room. 

Throughout all this, my mother heard us arguing & immediately blames me, asking why i had to raise my voice at my husband. Now I’m even more pissed. She’s always taking his side whenever we argue, regardless of the issue. Why wouldn’t I be upset, why shouldn’t i feel allowed to be upset? I went into a separate room and tried to calm down, my husband tries to talk to me but the whole time I feel like he’s gaslighting me. His reasoning was that he’s a dog, he doesn’t feel the pain (so what if he doesn’t feel the pain, the question is WHY the f#!k would you hit an animal???!!!!!) and that he was trying to “correct” him. I’m so goddamn pissed right now I can’t even think straight. I asked him, to try & help him understand why his reasons were wrong- I was saying to him, so if that was a kid, or if that was (insert his family’s dog name) “would you have done that?” And he said, “well I wouldn’t have reacted like you did, you were so loud” YEAH BECAUSE YOU HIT MY DOG FOR NO REASON!!!!!!! omfg pls lord have mercy bc I feel the fire running through my veins and my whole body is still shaking from the anger that I feel. 

PLEASE forgive the horrible format & grammar as I cannot even think straight right now, my head is literally replaying the moment he smacked my dog over and over again. I honestly don’t even want to be in the same house right now but if I leave, it’ll just make things worse. ",5,1731818820.0,TrueOffMyChest,14,0.7,False

Can I ask her to coffee?,"Okay, I know this is a weird question and maybe not the right place for it (and I might delete later cause I'm super embarrassed for posting).... but I get nervous about making new friends as an adult. TLDR at the end.

I'm 27F, been practicing off and on for like 8 years. I was recently off for like 3 years due to hip injury/surgeries. I just got back into it last week (finally 8 mos post final surgery) and have been going to a new studio for hot yoga daily. 

My very first class at the new studio, the teacher and I hit it off for a minute because I told her I'd had hip surgery and she (also 27F) had had the same surgery. 

At the next class that she taught a week later, we spent like 5 mins after class talking about our surgeries and comparing notes. We're both young healthy women and neither of us know anyone else so young who has had this surgery. At the end of the conversation, she asked if I was going to a weekend class at the studio. I said I was. She said she was too as a practitioner and that she'd ""look for me there.""

I'm assuming this means maybe we'll put our mats next to eachother if possible? (Not my main question, but also wondering)

I know this all sounds super lame probably but I'm like nervous because in all my years of studio yoga 1) I've never made a friend/practiced with someone else I knew beside my mom haha. And 2) the friend has certainly not been a teacher. But I also really like chatting with her and wonder if I should ask her if we should grab coffee after class?

I know I'm probably being super weird, but I'm not very confident with making friends like this as an adult. I'm more used to connecting in a group setting or with my fiancé's friends' girlfriends over time.

I think I feel extra intimidated because she is an instructor. Am I just being ridiculous? Should I ask her to grab coffee?? Yoga teachers are just people too, right? Haha. Anyone else become friends with their teacher?

TLDR: Is it weird to ask a yoga teacher whose classes I go to if she wants to grab coffee after class (not her class)? In a friendly, platonic, two women kind of way.",12,1731818330.0,yoga,24,0.8,False

1gt5qlk,https://i.redd.it/rib3g4n94e1e1.jpeg,Layout help; prep area by range? Corner cabinet help! ,"We just received the first draft of our cabinet plans, and I’d love your input on a few design details:

1.	Prep Space by the Range:
How important is it to have a dedicated prep area next to the range? Right now, the two appliance garages (circled in the plans, added to hide our coffee machines, KitchenAid, etc.) take up most of the counter space in that area. This seems to be a common layout in many kitchens today—so maybe it’s fine? Or would you consider removing the appliance garages, converting them into standard upper cabinets, and reclaiming that counter space for prep work? If we go that route, what would be a better solution for where to place the two coffee machines? Underneath the open shelves? 

2.	Corner Cabinet Design:
Between the sink and the range, would the corner cabinet be completely impractical if we don’t wrap it around? My husband and I are both tall, so we could access it, but I can see how it might not be ideal. If we wrap it, we gain usability but lose the symmetry, which I really like as it stands.

3.	Lower Corner Cabinet Insert:
Do you have any recommendations for pros, cons, or hacks when it comes to lower corner cabinet inserts? Would a lazy Susan, pull-out shelves, or other options make the most sense for functionality in this space?

Additional Notes:

	•	The open shelves are for our daily plates and cups, a system we currently have and love.
	•	The placement of all appliances needs to remain as is.

I had a crush on a girl from my school's art class. Despite attending the same school, I never mustered the courage to approach her due to our strict school environment.

We reconnected at a school reunion, and I worked up the courage to send her an Instagram follow request and ask her out for coffee. To my surprise, she agreed.

Our first date was disappointing. We met at a café she suggested, and I struggled to be myself. The conversation felt forced, unlike my previous (successful) date with someone else.

Post-date, our communication was sporadic. I'd initiate conversations and send reels, hinting at my interest. She'd respond briefly, indicating disinterest. I backed off. But I used to reply her once in month to any intresting story she posted otherwise no any hi hellos. 

Few month later, she initiated a meetup at a café I suggested. This date was pleasant, but our communication remains minimal and way better than first. After few days to this date , i asked her to join to try a famous pizza place in a city she denied saying it's very intimate for me going out with a boy like this , I mean wtf 😂😂  few days ago she wanted to meet the same boy and now all of a sudden it's too intimate . So this time I didn't even tried anything and complety backed off. 

Also Recently, she asked about my exams. I'm unsure how to proceed. She has me listed as a close friend on Instagram and posts cute pictures, but responds dryly to compliments ( she was too cute too resist).

1gt5nti,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1gt5nti/trip_report_animal_kingdom_lodge_club_level/,Trip Report: Animal Kingdom Lodge Club Level Savanna View and Animal Kingdom Extended Evening Hours,"My wife and I spent Thursday and Friday at Animal Kingdom Lodge. We managed to book a club level savanna view room as a part of our anniversary celebration. Since we're local and passholders, we decided we'd mainly focus our time on enjoying the resort. I'm breaking down the details here so others can have some insight into this sort of stay. Suffice it to say, we had a super fun time and will definitely be doing it again in the future.

**Checking In:** Since we knew club level perks can be used on check-in and check-out day, we planned to take full advantage during our stay. We arrived in the morning in time for breakfast. We checked in through the app and put that we'd be checking in early. Our plan was to leave our bags with bell services until our room was ready, but our room was ready by 9:45 am. We walked into Jambo House and noticed a man in a suit holding a tablet with our last name. We went over to him and introduced ourselves. He welcomed us, checked my ID, confirmed our room was ready, and asked if we wanted to go to our room or to breakfast. We told him breakfast and he led us to the elevators.

The club lounge is on the 6th floor and requires a key card or magic band for access. We forgot our magic bands, so he tapped in initially for us. He had us leave our bags by the club lounge concierge desk and told us to go get our breakfast while he worked on getting our key cards ready. He also had the woman at the desk make us anniversary buttons. He even asked if we wanted mimosas and then went and got us some with their ""jungle juice"" (which I think is POG?). We ate breakfast (which I'll cover in a separate section) then headed to our room.

**The Room:** Our room was on the 4th floor which is apparently where club level, non-DVC rooms are. The room itself was pretty standard for a Disney World hotel. The decor was very cute and themed perfectly. The shower was honestly a little small compared to something like Coronado, but manageable. The plug and USB situation was much better than some others though, with multiple options on both sides of the beds (we had 2 queens). The beds, bedding, and pillows were all standard issue, along with the toiletries. 

Of course, this being a savanna view room, the balcony was the most important bit. There were two chairs and a little table, and right out from the room we could see the savanna. We were right off of the Jambo House lobby overlook actually. There were plenty of times with no animals, but there were also times with lots of animals. We had zebras right below our balcony, could see the giraffes eating nearby, and watched the pelicans get fed by the watering hole. We got some great pictures.

I was a little worried about privacy being so close to the overlook, but when I checked from the overlook, you couldn't actually see into any of the rooms if the glass was closed. There were also curtains which could be closed, so it didn't feel invasive or anything.

**The Food:** We had never stayed club level and weren't entirely sure what to expect outside of some blog posts my wife had found. But after reading a bit about it, we decided to see if we could reasonably avoid spending any money on food or beverage during our stay. This meant only eating what was provided in the club lounge. And I'm happy to say that we were entirely successful.

For breakfast, there was an assortment of pastries, yogurt, granola, fruit, oatmeal with fixins, a meat, an egg dish, cereals, bread, bagels, and a sweet treat. The first day, there was African sausage, a curry egg bake thing, and caramel pecan sticky buns. The sausage was great, eggs were meh, and the sticky buns were pretty good (too much for me but my wife loved them). The second day, they had bacon, scrambled eggs with spinach, tomato, and feta, and a caramel butterscotch bread pudding. All of these were better than the alternatives from the day prior. Pastry-wise, the highlights were the cheese danish which they only had the first day and the chocolate chip loaf thing which they had both days. They also had mini muffins (blueberry the first day and apple cinnamon the second, both decent), buttery croissants which were pretty good, and whole wheat croissants which were about how you'd expect them to be. There was a toaster for the bread and bagels along with butter, jam, and cream cheese. They had three kinds of cereal and I believe only 2% milk. Both days, we were offered containers to take some food back to our room which meant we were able to have some pastries on the balcony while watching the animals.

The midday snacks were the least exciting. There were cucumbers, celery, and carrot sticks with a bland, odd textured hummus and a pretty decent ranch for dipping. There were also quartered Uncrustables and bags of chips, including pita chips to use with the underwhelming hummus. And the first day they had turkey and cheese wrap rolls, but not on the second day. There may have also been marinated olives, I don't remember for sure.

The ""hors d'oeuvres"" were great and could definitely be considered a dinner. There were charcuterie with two meats, three cheeses, and three types of breads/crackers along with three types of hummus (all tasty), and some different mustards/dips. There was also fruit, and a ""safe foods"" section that had Uncrustables and mini corndogs the first day and turkey and cheese wrap rolls and mac 'n cheese the second day. There were some other cold dishes, like a really great tabouli one day and a curry cauliflower salad the next. And finally there was a separate area to the side with speciality hot dishes. The first day was tomato soup with paneer and butter chicken with basmati rice. I didn't have either but my wife had both and liked them. The second day, they had a seafood stew with rice and some kind of pulled chicken on a sweet corn pudding as they called it. I loved the seafood stew and my wife loved the corn stuff.

For desserts, they had a variety of little cakes and tarts with different offerings both nights. I don't remember them all but special mention goes to the orange sesame seed cakes and the banana cream tarts. They also had some blandish chocolate chip cookies and oddly citrusy sugar cookies (had sprinkles one day and cinnamon sugar the next but definitely not a snickerdoodle). There was also a little ice cream cooler with Mickey ice cream sandwiches, Mickey ice cream bars, and real fruit popsicles.

During all meals, there were also bananas, apples, and clementines available. The second day, they also had jars of candy. One jar had peppermints, one jar had Starburst, and the third had Ghiradelli sea salt caramel squares.

**The Drinks:** There was a Nespresso machine with regular and decaf espresso. It also poured hot water for tea, of which there were 7 or 8 varieties and hot chocolate. They had all manner of sugars and sweeteners, including little personal sized jars of honey. They had regular and decaf coffee as well as 2% milk and half-and-half. There was dispenser for ice cold filtered water and sparkling water. There was also a cooler with Coke, Diet Coke, orange Fanta, Sprite, and juice boxes. These were all available at all times. Then there were juices for breakfast, a bar cart for dinner, and a couple bottles of ""night cap"" type liquors for dessert.

On top of all of this, you could ask for drinks that were not available. We were able to get sangria during midday, mimosas for breakfast, and this wonderful cast member named Francisco was always making fun concoctions for guests. Don't ask him for something specific though. In his words, he makes what you need in the moment.

Again, all of this was included with our club level stay. We didn't overindulge, but we each had multiple alcoholic drinks and some variety of coffee, tea, soda, and juice both days. We also got cold water bottles each time we left the lounge.

**Extended Evening Hours:** Thursday was extended evening hours at Animal Kingdom for deluxe resort guests. Since we'd never stayed at a deluxe resort before, we decided to take advantage. After dinner (hors d'oeuvres that we made a meal of), we headed to the bus stop. I'm not sure of the exact timing of everything, but dinner started at 5 pm and we were in line for Flight of Passage by 6:30 pm. At the front of the park and at each ride, they scanned our tickets (we used our Apple Wallets on our phones) to confirm we were deluxe guests. We walked straight to Flight of Passage, walked through the queue, and straight into the first pre-show room, zero line-waiting. We then went to Na'vi River Journey and had maybe a 3 minute wait. We then made our way to Dinosaur where we were once again led straight to the pre-show room. After our first ride, we asked everyone in the car if they wanted to ride again, then we asked the cast members if we could since no one was waiting. So we got to ride it twice in a row without getting off (just had to unbuckle, stand up, sit, and rebuckle). With about 15 minutes to spare, we made our way to Everest, walked through the queue, waited for one cycle so we could ride in the front. We had four other people on the ride with us. We actually had to wait a moment on the chain lift because they sent the car too early.

With all of that, we were still back to the resort in time to enjoy dessert at the club lounge. The line to get back on the bus was a bit long, but they were very efficient in loading the buses and getting the line to move.

**Other Resort Stuff:** We enjoyed the pool which was far less crowded midday than any other resort we've been to. The arcade had more games and they were priced decently. Even had two pinball machines that were mostly in working order. We made our way over to Kidani Village to check out their savanna view as well, and went around to the different outlooks at Jambo House too. The flamingos were particularly cute.

**Specific Cast Member Shoutouts:** As mentioned, Francisco in the club lounge was one of our favorites. He's nice, a bit silly, has a fun sense of humor, and makes lots of fun cocktails. Myles at the club lounge desk was also super friendly and upbeat. And we made a friend named Emmy who told us a lot about the animals and her home town of Cape Town, South Africa.

**The Wrap:** All in all, it was a fantastic two days. Aside from the cost of the room, we spent a total of $10 which was at the arcade. The two of us ate and drank our fair share (and more) for two days without spending an extra dime and neither of us felt like anything was lacking. Of course it was even more awesome doing all of this while hanging out with zebras, giraffes, antelopes, wildebeests, pelicans, and flamingos.

1gt5lcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1gt5lcl/how_do_you_know_if_breaking_up_with_a_good/,How do you know if breaking up with a good partner was the right decision?,"7 months ago, I (28M) broke up with my first girlfriend (26F) after a year and 3 months together and I’m still unsure if I made the right decision.

My reasons at the time were that I didn’t feel at ease together or that we were a good fit for each other. We were very physical and serious, but we weren’t great friends, didn’t naturally click and had different senses of humour that weren’t able to balance our intensity out, nor did we have deep conversations. I couldn’t read her emotions easily and she sometimes got angry over small things I did/didn’t do (even though she always apologised later) and so I felt anxious about doing enough and being attentive to her when we were together. All of these things added up so that I felt drained and sometimes like I was on eggshells around her. It was just a lot of hard work and didn’t come easily. Our texting felt amazing and easy, but in person it was harder.

Despite this, in hindsight I feel like I threw away something incredible. Everything that really matters was there — she loved me unconditionally, we fought really well, we always respected each other, shared in each other’s interests, had the same values/goals in life and she was just an incredible, patient, creative woman, the most attractive I’ve EVER known. I wonder if I didn’t give us enough time to build a strong foundation and maybe we could have made it if we communicated better and worked on our issues together, and if we put more effort into emotional and other forms of non-sexual intimacy.

Two months ago (5 months in) I broke NC and wrote her a letter to apologise, explain what I’d learned and ask if she would be open for a coffee just to talk. She eventually texted saying she felt hurt by the way I reached out, that I had my chance with her and she doesn’t want to hear from me again. It crushed me but I understand the hurt I caused, I respect her decision and I tried all I could now so I have to move on. It feels impossible but it’s more important to me that she’s happy, even though I’m really not sure how to stop loving someone so much, I know I have to find a way.

Even after 7 months she’s constantly on my mind and I miss her more than I can say. I get upset thinking about the love letters, scrapbook and notes she wrote me. I’m really trying to get out and spend time with friends and family, I even did solo travel for a month overseas, but it’s easier to be at home by myself because when I’m out and doing fun things they feel empty without her. I’m always hoping we’ll run into each other and rekindle. I tried dating but it just makes me miss her more. Maybe I need more time and therapy and to meet the right person, but it’s impossible to shake the feeling we could still be together and worked through our differences if I hadn’t given up.

Are we really doing this? The French Press is like the '86 Celtics of coffee makers! It's got that blue-collar toughness, it's not trying to be flashy, it just shows up every morning and gets the job done.

Look, my dad - huge coffee guy, been drinking it since the Bird era - he always says to me, ""Billy, you know what's wrong with these new coffee makers? They're too soft! In my day, you had to manually grind the beans, none of this pod nonsense."" And he's right! The Keurig is like the 2017 Warriors - sure, it's efficient, it's winning the regular season, but where's the soul? Where's the struggle?

I actually have a theory about this. I call it the Coffee Maker Revolution Theory. Stay with me here. So you've got your 80s - classic percolator era, real lunch-pail kind of coffee making. Then the 90s hit, and suddenly everyone's getting these massive espresso machines - the Shaq of coffee makers, just totally dominating the counter space. But here's the thing - and I've written about this in my coffee book that's definitely coming out sometime in 2025 - we're living in the Position-less Coffee Making Era now.

House, am I crazy for thinking the Chemex is having a 2008 CP3 moment right now? Just absolutely controlling the game, perfect timing, making everyone around it better? And don't even get me started on the Aeropress, which is basically the Jayson Tatum of coffee brewing - young, versatile, still figuring things out but clearly on a Hall of Fame trajectory.

Mallory, are we sure the French Press isn't the most re-watchable coffee maker of all time? Like, if you're flipping channels at 2 AM and you see a French Press brewing on Food Network, you're watching it! That's just a fact!

It was a moonlit night on Mirror Lake, the kind of evening that makes you feel like you’re walking through a dream. The water lay still, reflecting the silver light like a polished gem, and the air hummed with the quiet symphony of nature, the crickets, the soft rustle of trees, and the occasional splash of a fish breaking the surface. Pete Lawson had been coming to this lake every summer since he was a kid, and tonight, he was there for one thing: the promise of solitude and the whisper of a big catch.



Pete was what you’d call a “true-blue fisherman.” Not one of those weekend warriors with their fancy gadgets and thousand-dollar gear. No, Pete loved the simplicity of it,the patience, the quiet, the slow dance between man and nature. It was his escape. Life on land had grown a bit too noisy for him lately, with its bills and deadlines and the constant hum of the city that seemed to follow him wherever he went. Out here on the water, there were no emails, no buzzing phones, no clocks ticking away the hours. Just Pete, his trusty rod, and the endless night ahead.



He had settled into his little rowboat just before dusk, paddling out to his favorite spot where the willow trees cast long, shadowy fingers across the water. Pete dropped anchor, leaned back, and cast his line into the mirrored surface, watching as the ripples spread and disappeared.



The hours ticked by peacefully, marked only by the occasional tug on the line and the hoot of an owl somewhere in the distance. But as midnight approached, something strange began to happen. The air, which had been comfortably cool, turned suddenly cold, a biting chill that raised goosebumps on Pete’s arms and sent a shiver down his spine. The lake, so serene moments before, seemed to darken, the surface rippling as if something had disturbed it.



Pete straightened in his seat, gripping his rod a little tighter. He scanned the water, his heart beating a little faster now. “Probably just the wind,” he muttered to himself, though the trees stood eerily still.



And that’s when he saw it.



A faint glow appeared at the edge of the lake, where the shoreline melted into shadows. At first, Pete thought it might be someone with a lantern, a fellow night fisher perhaps, but the light wasn’t warm like fire. It was pale and cold, like moonlight trapped in a jar. As he squinted into the darkness, the figure began to take shape, emerging slowly from the mist that seemed to rise from nowhere.



It was a man or at least, it looked like one. Tall and thin, with a wide-brimmed hat that cast a shadow over his face. He wore old-fashioned clothes, the kind you might see in sepia-toned photographs: a loose shirt, suspenders, and boots that didn’t make a sound as he walked. But the strangest thing about him wasn’t his appearance; it was the way he moved. He seemed to glide over the ground, his feet never quite touching the earth, as if the laws of gravity didn’t apply to him.



Pete froze, his mind racing. Was this some kind of prank? A trick of the light? But deep down, he knew better. This was no ordinary man.



The figure stopped at the edge of the water, not twenty feet from Pete’s boat. He raised a hand slowly, as if to wave, but there was no warmth in the gesture. Pete swallowed hard, his mouth dry as dust.



“Hello?” he called out, his voice breaking the silence like a stone thrown into still water.



The figure didn’t respond. Instead, it reached into a satchel slung over its shoulder and pulled out something long and slender, a fishing rod. Pete watched, his breath caught in his throat, as the figure cast its line into the lake with an eerie grace. The rod bent slightly, as if hooked on something unseen, and the ghostly fisherman began to reel it in, his movements slow and deliberate.



For a moment, Pete just sat there, too stunned to move. The scene was almost surreal, like something out of a dream or a nightmare. But as he watched, a strange curiosity began to take hold of him, overpowering his fear. What was this… entity? And what, exactly, was it fishing for?



Gathering his courage, Pete reached for his oars and began to paddle slowly toward the figure. The water seemed to resist him, the boat cutting through it with an unnatural heaviness, but he pressed on.



As he drew closer, the details of the ghostly fisherman became clearer. The figure’s clothes were damp and tattered, as if they’d been pulled from the depths of the lake, and its hands were thin, almost skeletal and moved with a mechanical precision. But it was the face, or rather the lack of it, that sent a fresh wave of terror through Pete. The man’s features were obscured, like a portrait smudged beyond recognition, leaving only a faint suggestion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth.



Pete stopped paddling, his boat drifting to a halt a few yards away. “Who… who are you?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.



The figure paused, tilting its head slightly as if considering the question. Then, to Pete’s astonishment, it spoke.



“I am a fisherman,” the figure said, its voice low and hollow, like the wind whistling through an empty bottle. “And I am not.”



Pete blinked, trying to make sense of the words. “What does that mean?” he asked. “What are you doing here?”



The ghostly figure cast its line again, the sound of the reel clicking softly in the stillness. “I fish,” it said simply. “As I have always done. As I will always do.”



Pete felt a chill run down his spine. There was something deeply unsettling about the way the figure spoke, as if its words carried the weight of eternity. “What are you fishing for?” he asked, his voice trembling despite his efforts to sound calm.



The figure turned its head toward him, though its featureless face betrayed no emotion. “Souls,” it said, and the word hung in the air like a stone sinking into the depths.



Pete’s stomach lurched. “Souls?” he echoed, his mind racing. “What do you mean? Whose souls?”



The figure didn’t answer. Instead, it began to reel in its line, and Pete noticed for the first time that the water around the boat seemed to be moving, swirling in slow, deliberate circles. A faint glow appeared beneath the surface, growing brighter as the figure pulled its line closer.



And then, with a sudden burst of light, something broke the surface. Pete shielded his eyes, squinting through the glare, and saw… something. It was impossible to describe, a shape that seemed to shift and shimmer like smoke caught in a beam of light. It wasn’t a fish, that much was clear.



The figure reached out, its skeletal hand closing around the glowing form, and for a moment, Pete thought he saw faces, countless faces all trapped within the light, their mouths open in silent screams.



Panic surged through him, and he grabbed his oars, desperate to put as much distance as possible between himself and the ghostly scene. But as he began to row, the figure turned toward him, holding the glowing form in its hand.



“You are here,” it said, its voice echoing in Pete’s mind like a distant thunderclap. “And so you are mine.”



Pete’s heart pounded as he rowed with all his might, the boat lurching through the water. The glow behind him grew brighter, and he could feel the weight of the figure’s gaze, cold and unrelenting. The lake seemed to stretch endlessly before him, the shoreline disappearing into the shadows, and for a moment, he thought he might never escape.



But then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the light vanished. The air grew still, the water calm once more. Pete stopped rowing, his chest heaving as he looked back over his shoulder. The figure was gone. The lake was empty.



For a long moment, Pete sat there, his hands trembling on the oars. Had it all been a hallucination? A trick of the mind brought on by exhaustion? But as he glanced down at the water, he saw something that made his blood run cold.



A faint glow lingered beneath the surface, moving slowly, deliberately, as if circling his boat. And then, just as quickly as it appeared, it was gone, leaving only the dark, silent depths.



Pete didn’t wait to see if it would return. He rowed back to shore as fast as his arms would allow, his mind racing with questions he couldn’t answer. Who or what was the ghost fisherman? And why had it chosen him?



He never returned to Mirror Lake after that night, though the memory haunted him for the rest of his days. And sometimes, when the night was quiet and the moon shone bright, he could swear he heard the faint sound of a reel clicking in the distance, calling him back to the water.



For the ghost fisherman waits, as he always has. And as he always will.





Pete Lawson lived the next fifteen years with the weight of that terrible night at Mirror Lake. He never told anyone the full story, not even his wife. How could he? Who would believe that he had come face-to-face with something that fished for souls in the cold, black depths? Still, the memory never left him. It was there in the shadows when he closed his eyes, in the quiet hum of a fishing reel he swore he could sometimes hear in the stillness of the night.



And so, he avoided Mirror Lake like the plague. His fishing trips took him far away to safer waters, and he made sure his family knew the lake wasn’t worth their time, inventing tales of poor fishing and overcrowded shores. But life has a funny way of bringing you back to the things you run from. But...



Today was his son Caleb’s bachelor party, a cheerful, boisterous affair planned with youthful enthusiasm. Caleb had insisted on celebrating with his closest friends in the same spirit as his dad’s stories of fishing and laughter. Unfortunately, they’d chosen the wrong lake: Mirror Lake.



Pete had begged them to pick another spot. “There are better lakes,” he’d said. “Bigger fish, fewer mosquitoes.” But Caleb had been adamant. Mirror Lake was a family tradition, a sentimental choice for a group of childhood friends and their fathers. Pete’s objections were brushed aside as the ramblings of an old man.



Now, Pete stood on the dock, his stomach churning with unease. The sun was sinking behind the treeline, painting the water gold and orange. The air was alive with the chatter of the bachelor party as they loaded coolers of drinks and fishing gear into the pontoon boat. Caleb laughed, his broad grin lighting up his face, and Pete felt a pang of guilt for not sharing the truth.



He told himself it would be fine. The ghost fisherman hadn’t appeared in fifteen years, and surely, it wouldn’t reappear now. He repeated the thought like a mantra, but deep down, he knew better.



As the boat pushed off from the dock, the lake shimmered like molten glass. Pete felt a deep, foreboding chill settle over him, even as the others drank and joked, oblivious to the growing weight in the air.



The party had been in full swing for hours. The sun had long since disappeared, replaced by a full moon that cast an eerie glow over the lake. The group had anchored near the center of the water, their laughter carrying across the still surface. Pete tried to relax, but his eyes kept darting to the horizon, searching for something he prayed not to see.



Then came the sound.



It was faint at first, almost like a trick of the wind: the unmistakable click-click-click of a fishing reel. Pete froze, his beer slipping from his hand and landing with a soft thud on the boat’s deck. The sound sent shivers racing down his spine, pulling him back to that night, to the glowing figure with its skeletal hands.



He scanned the water, his heart pounding in his chest. “Did anyone else hear that?” he asked, his voice tight.



“Hear what?” Caleb asked, raising an eyebrow.



“That… reel.” Pete’s voice faltered.



The group chuckled, assuming it was just another of his old fisherman’s stories. “Come on, Dad,” Caleb said. “Don’t tell me you’re trying to scare us with one of your ghost stories.”



Pete’s face was pale, his hands gripping the side of the boat like a man clinging to a lifeline. “We need to leave. Now.”



The laughter died away as the men saw the fear in Pete’s eyes. Caleb frowned. “Dad, what’s going on?”



But before Pete could answer, the boat rocked violently, nearly tipping several of the men into the water. The laughter and chatter stopped instantly, replaced by startled cries.



“What the hell was that?” one of the friends yelled.



Pete didn’t answer. His eyes were fixed on the water, where ripples were spreading out from the boat, as if something massive had just passed beneath them. The temperature dropped sharply, the warm summer night replaced by a bone-chilling cold. The lake, which had been so calm, now seemed alive, the water swirling and shifting unnaturally.



And then they saw it.



At first, it was just a glow,a faint, pale light appearing on the surface of the water, far from the boat. But it grew steadily brighter, closer, until the outline of the ghost fisherman emerged from the mist. The spectral figure stood on the water itself, its tattered clothes fluttering in a wind that didn’t exist.



Pete’s voice was barely a whisper. “It’s him.”



The group stared in stunned silence as the ghost fisherman raised its rod and cast its line into the water. The reel clicked softly as it began to turn, and Pete’s heart sank. He knew what was coming next.



Chaos erupted on the boat as the men tried to make sense of what they were seeing. Caleb grabbed Pete by the shoulders, shaking him. “What is that? Dad, what is going on?”



“We need to get off the lake!” Pete shouted, his voice cracking. “Start the motor! Now!”



But before anyone could move, the ghost fisherman’s line snapped taut, and the boat lurched violently, as if hooked by something massive. The glowing figure began to reel it in slowly, methodically, pulling the boat closer.



The water beneath them churned with an unnatural energy, and Caleb’s friends scrambled for life jackets and oars, their earlier bravado replaced by sheer terror. Pete grabbed the motor’s starter cord and yanked it desperately, but the engine refused to catch.



“It won’t let us go,” Pete said, his voice trembling.



The ghost fisherman reeled them in steadily, the glow around it growing brighter with every turn of the reel. And then, with a sudden burst of light, the water erupted around the boat. Shapes began to rise from the depths, all twisted, glowing forms that seemed to shimmer like smoke. Pete recognized them immediately: the souls.



Faces emerged from the swirling light, their mouths open in silent screams, their hands reaching out toward the boat. Caleb and his friends shouted in terror, swatting at the spectral hands that clawed at the air.



“Dad!” Caleb yelled, grabbing Pete’s arm. “What do we do?”



Pete’s mind raced. He had spent fifteen years running from this moment, but now there was nowhere left to hide. He looked at his son, the fear in his eyes cutting through the haze of panic, and made a decision.



“I’ll stop it,” Pete said, his voice firm. “You get everyone to shore.”



“What? No!” Caleb protested.



“There’s no time!” Pete shouted. “I brought this on us. I have to end it.”



Before Caleb could stop him, Pete grabbed a flare from the boat’s emergency kit and dove into the water. The cold was like a thousand knives cutting into his skin, but he swam toward the ghost fisherman with a determination he hadn’t felt in years.



The figure turned to him, its featureless face seeming to regard him with cold amusement. Pete held up the lit flare, the bright red light cutting through the spectral glow.



“You’ve taken enough,” Pete said through chattering teeth. “You won’t take my son.”



With a burst of energy, he hurled the flare directly at the ghost fisherman. The light struck the figure, and for a moment, the lake was bathed in an intense, blinding glow. The spectral forms screamed, their shapes dissolving into the water as the ghost fisherman recoiled.



Pete felt himself being pulled downward, the cold water closing over his head as the light faded.



The next thing he knew, Pete was lying on the shore, coughing up water as Caleb knelt beside him. The boat had made it back, the group shaken but alive.



The lake was calm once more, the ghost fisherman gone. But Pete knew it wasn’t over. It would return, as it always did.



For now, though, he had won. And as he looked at his son, he knew it had been worth it.





Pete lay on the shoreline, the weight of exhaustion pressing down on him like a lead blanket. His chest heaved with every labored breath, his lungs burning from the icy grip of the lake’s waters. The faint murmur of voices around him, the panicked tones of Caleb and his friends sounded distant, like a half-remembered dream.



“Dad! Stay with me!” Caleb’s voice broke through the haze, sharp and urgent.



Pete’s eyelids fluttered open, revealing the concerned faces of Caleb and the others hovering above him. The moon shone bright overhead, casting long shadows that danced across the water’s surface. The lake looked serene, as if it had never been disturbed, but Pete knew better.



“I… I’m okay,” Pete croaked, his voice hoarse and weak. He tried to sit up, but Caleb’s strong hands kept him down.



“Take it easy,” Caleb said. “You nearly drowned.”



Pete gave a faint shake of his head. “It wasn’t the water… it was him.” He swallowed hard, the memory of the ghost fisherman still vivid in his mind. “I don’t think I stopped it. Just bought us time.”



The group exchanged uneasy glances, their earlier skepticism replaced by a grim understanding. No one doubted Pete now—not after what they had seen.



“What was that thing?” one of Caleb’s friends asked, his voice trembling.



Pete’s gaze drifted back to the lake, his expression grim. “The Eternal Fisherman,” he said. “A spirit bound to the lake, doomed to fish for souls forever.” He paused, his voice lowering. “Fifteen years ago, I escaped it. But it never stopped watching. Waiting. Tonight, it came back for me.”



“But why?” Caleb asked, his voice breaking. “Why you? Why us?”



Pete hesitated, his thoughts swirling like the lake’s restless waters. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “Maybe it’s drawn to those who linger here too long. Or maybe it just takes what it can.” He locked eyes with his son, his face lined with guilt. “But I should’ve warned you. I should’ve made sure you never came here.”



Caleb shook his head fiercely. “This isn’t your fault, Dad. None of us could’ve known.”



Pete didn’t respond, his mind replaying the events of the night. The ghost fisherman had recoiled when the flare struck it, its grip on the boat momentarily broken. But that was no victory, it was a reprieve. He could feel it, deep in his bones: the spirit was still out there, biding its time.



The group decided to pack up and leave immediately, their party plans abandoned. As they loaded their gear into their cars, the air around them felt heavy, oppressive, as if the lake itself were watching. Pete’s eyes never left the water, scanning for any sign of the ghostly glow that had haunted him for so long.



“Let’s go,” Caleb said, placing a hand on his father’s shoulder.



Pete nodded, climbing into the passenger seat of Caleb’s truck. As they drove away from Mirror Lake, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the lake wasn’t done with him yet.



Three Weeks Later



Pete hadn’t slept much since that night. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the ghost fisherman, its skeletal hands reeling in an invisible line, its featureless face turned toward him in silent judgment. He tried to go about his daily life, but the weight of the encounter clung to him like a second skin.



Caleb had called him several times, checking in and urging him to see a doctor. “You’re not yourself, Dad,” he’d said. “Maybe talking to someone will help.” But Pete knew no doctor could banish the specter that haunted him.



One night, as Pete sat alone in his living room, nursing a cup of coffee that had long since gone cold, he heard it again: the unmistakable click-click-click of a fishing reel.



His heart stopped. The sound was faint, barely audible over the hum of the refrigerator, but it was there. Slowly, he stood and walked to the window, peering out into the darkness. His backyard was empty, the trees swaying gently in the breeze. But the sound persisted, growing louder, closer.



Pete’s hands shook as he locked the doors and turned off the lights. He knew it was futile, the ghost fisherman didn’t need an invitation.



That night, Pete dreamed of Mirror Lake. In the dream, he was back on the water, alone in his little rowboat. The surface of the lake was perfectly still, reflecting the stars above like a mirror. But as he looked closer, he realized the reflections weren’t stars they were eyes. Hundreds of them, staring up at him from the depths.



The water began to churn, and the ghost fisherman rose from the center of the lake, its glowing figure casting long, eerie shadows. It raised its rod, casting its line with a precision that sent shivers down Pete’s spine. The line arced through the air, landing silently in the water near his boat.



Pete tried to row away, but the oars were heavy, unyielding. The boat didn’t move. The ghost fisherman began to reel in the line, and Pete felt an invisible force pulling him toward the figure.



“You are mine,” the spirit intoned, its voice echoing like a funeral bell.



Pete woke with a start, drenched in sweat and gasping for air. The room was dark, silent, but the dream felt so real that he could still feel the pull of the line, the cold grip of the lake’s waters.



The Final Stand



Pete knew he couldn’t live like this. The ghost fisherman wasn’t going to stop, it would haunt him until it finally claimed him. There was only one thing left to do: he had to go back to Mirror Lake and confront the spirit once and for all.



Armed with nothing but a lantern, a flare gun, and his old fishing rod, Pete returned to the lake under the cover of darkness. The shoreline was quiet, the water as smooth as glass, but the oppressive feeling of being watched was undeniable.



He stepped into a small rowboat and pushed off, his hands steady despite the fear coursing through him. He rowed to the center of the lake, the spot where he had first encountered the ghost fisherman all those years ago.



“I’m here!” Pete shouted into the night, his voice echoing across the water. “You want me? Come and get me!”



For a long moment, there was only silence. Then, the water began to ripple, and the ghost fisherman emerged from the mist, its glowing figure as terrifying as Pete remembered.



The spirit raised its rod, casting its line with a slow, deliberate motion. Pete didn’t flinch. He gripped his own rod tightly, casting his line in defiance. The two lines crossed in midair, tangling together in a bright, glowing tangle.



The ghost fisherman froze, its head tilting slightly as if in surprise. Pete seized the moment, grabbing the flare gun and firing it directly at the spirit. The flare exploded in a burst of red light, illuminating the lake and setting the mist ablaze.



The ghost fisherman let out an otherworldly scream, its form flickering like a dying flame. Pete felt the pull of the lake lessen, the water calming beneath him. But he didn’t wait to see if the spirit would recover.



He rowed back to shore as fast as he could, his heart pounding with adrenaline. As he reached the dock, he turned back for one final look. The lake was still, the ghost fisherman gone.



For the first time in fifteen years, Pete felt a sense of peace. The nightmare was over. Or so he hoped.



As he walked away from the lake, the faint sound of a reel clicking echoed in the distance, a chilling reminder that some spirits never truly rest.

(Side note - He came through the drive thru two days prior and screamed at us and sped off because we told him the same thing.) I offered him pike or an americano and he got so unbelievably mad.

I work in banking for one of America’s top banks, and have been in the industry for close to 9 years. I’m 5’9”, divorced with zero kids, Hispanic, with a pierced nose and one arm and one leg full of tattoos. In my free time I enjoy resting; nap anyone? I like trying new restaurants, coffee shops, breweries, bars, you name it, I love to try it! I enjoy traveling, mostly to city centers or countrysides, not so much beaches. I don’t play many video games or watch anime at all, but that doesn’t mean I’m not open to it. I like trivia nights, sporting events, farmers markets, plant stores and antiques.

I guess what I’m looking for is a partner. Someone I can connect with, someone I can have fun with, someone to be lazy with, someone to travel with. Looking for some to make laugh and to make me laugh. I guess someone to do anything and everything with. Not really sold on one relationship type, though lately I have been leaning polyamorous, so I am open for discussion!

Maybe you’re out there in the world, and maybe I’m the one you’re looking for, or maybe I’m not but let’s chat like we’ve been friends for ten years and see where it goes. No pressure, no expectations, just two people connecting. Or maybe you want to be flirty and make out! I’m down for anything.

I promise I don’t normally blab this much, but I’m an open book and you can ask anything!
