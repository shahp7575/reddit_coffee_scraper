**ONE YEAR ON UPDATE**


Thank you everyone who has been messaging over the last year to see how I‚Äôm going and asking for an update. (Scroll below for the full story)
It‚Äôs been a crazy, painful year. But our divorce has been finalised. And I‚Äôm free. 

My ex husband and my ex best friend as no surprise are now in an actual relationship after the ex best friend‚Äôs husband found out about the affair.
He divorced her, and since then we have met up for coffee to check in on each other and our mental health. He‚Äôs been great sending encouraging messages and he lives overseas and from his Facebook updates has started dating again. So I‚Äôm very happy for him! 

The legal and custody battles had been fairly stressful but the ex husband agreed to all my terms the custody of the children was the only thing he really fought for. I have custody of the kids and he sees them on the weekends. 
The kids including myself have all been going to therapy separately. 
My ex husband wants to see them more and during school break the kids have the choice to stay with him or me. They have been good about it and stay with him for a week or so and then back to their mummy. Apart from necessary conversation I steer away from my ex husband and the ex best friend. It still hurts so much and I understand that it will take some time to heal. 
But I am letting go, because I don‚Äôt want them to have that level of influence over my life.

I decided to sell the property we were living in and move closer to family and friends because as you know, ‚Äúit takes a village‚Äù. And I have been extremely grateful for the support I have received over the last year. I‚Äôm tearing up just as I‚Äôm writing this, knowing that I couldn‚Äôt go through all of this without my loved ones. 

And for myself, I am happy overall, still a work in progress but grateful for life. The kids and myself have been enjoying life and when we have the time and the money try and take little trips here and there so the traumatic events of the divorce doesn‚Äôt linger and can be replaced by good memories. Memories where they spent road trips and adventures with their mum.

******************************************
******************************************
******************************************

I recently found out that my husband 42 is cheating on me with our married best friend (32F). She is the godmother to our 4 children

They don't know that I know, but I caught them making out at the end of our driveway when he was seeing her off after dinner with our family. We live on a small acreage and the driveway is a long way off from the main house.

She had forgotten some crockery at the house and I decided to walk it over, because for some reason the two of them always took a while to say goodbye. (Now I know why!) That's when I saw them lit by her car's headlights. Making out in the front seat with our best friend straddling my husband.

In shock I didn't know whether to throw her pyrex at the car or just walk away.

I decided the latter, and was too shocked to cry or be angry.

When my husband got back, I had to pretend like everything was normal.

I know that it's stupid but I couldn't sleep that night and decided to go through his phone. She was obviously under a pseudonym but I found a handful of their messages dating 2 or 3 years.

Her husband doesn't know, he's currently posted overseas as a diplomat.

I'm sick with rage and betrayal. I'm lost and have no idea what steps to take next.

UPDATE: Woah didn't expect this much support. It's really overwhelming. Just to clarify a few things: This is a private account I created just for this post away from my usual account because I was scared it would be traced back to me. I want to remain anonymous as much as I can.

I don't live in the US - but in Australia. Technically, I can't file for divorce immediately - as you need to be separated for 1 year and 1 day to file officially.

My now ex best friend just recently returned to the country (her father has cancer) after being posted with her husband overseas. The dinner was to welcome her home - and what a welcome! ü•∫

There's some comments here about the headlights illuminating them. Sorry I meant overhead lights.

As to what I'm going to do now - a part of me just wants to confront my husband, see what lame excuse he has. But I need to get away from him. This level of betrayal physically hurts. I can't help but think of all the times we spent together over the years and for how long our families were fooled. My mind is going crazy, when she was single and he would ""rescue"" her from some bad date or the times they were alone in my house when the kids and I were out. How irrationally angry he was when he found out she had a boyfriend then chose to marry him.

Thinking back on it, the two of them disappeared at her wedding. When I asked him where he was, he said he needed to reassure her that she had done the right thing. I feel so so sick thinking of these things.

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your concern and advice. As of tomorrow my husband is out of town. I've tried really hard to act normal around my now ex best friend but it's proving difficult and I feel sick. I have been telling both of them that I've caught some terrible bug and just not feeling myself.

While my husband is out of town for the next few days, my sister in law who is the only other person who knows (my brother's wife) will help me pack important documents - and store them somewhere my husband doesn't know about. I've organised for my kids to stay with them for a week while I sort my shit out. I've spoken to a family lawyer and they have told me that the best way to start the separation procedure is to no longer be living under the same roof.

I'm fortunate in that most of our assets are also in my name, and the land our house is on was gifted to us by my parents.

I'm planning to kick him out after his trip. But before that, I want to catch them both in the act again. Have some hard proof, send it to the ex friend's husband and get the ball rolling for moving on with my life.

I'll update with what happens after the confrontation.

&#x200B;

**FINAL UPDATE:**

My husband came home two nights ago from his trip. While he was gone, I had organised a lot of the important documents eg. financial, birth certificates, passports, anything that he could potentially use to try and get more than what he deserves. 

They are now safely stored and my kids have been staying with their Aunt and Uncle for the past few days.

I had packed all my husband's things and he has been really good at keeping his tracks clean because there was no evidence of his affair within his stuff.  I placed all his belongings in the garage ready for the confrontation with him. I was super nervous because I wasn't sure if I was making the right decision. Once he came home and I remembered seeing him kissing our best friend - I remembered the deep hurt they had caused. 

I was in our kitchen when he came home and he knew straight away something was wrong. During that week I had been distant and had barely answered his texts and screened his calls. I did answer every now and again and gave the kids a chance to speak to their Dad. He asked me why I hadn't been responding to his texts and he tried to kiss me but I turned away and before I knew it the first things that came out of my mouth were, I want a separation. I have to admit that he didn't look very surprised when I said it, he nodded his head and said, what do you know? Which was just a punch in the gut, because I wanted to him to deny it or say something like it was a one off thing. I asked him to tell me everything, like when did it start? And he said they started about 10 years ago, at first it was flirtatious messaging and a sneaky kiss in the office when they briefly worked together and the affair was on and off. She apparently always felt guilty and her way out of that was to marry the next man that was interested in her and proposed. He admitted that they had sex on her wedding day and when he is out of town they meet. At this point I couldn't breathe and I was sobbing. I hated that the next words out of my mouth was, did you even ever love me? He hesitated and said yes of course but he was never in love with me the way he was with her. 

I cleared my throat and had said to him that he should tell her husband - there is no point hiding it anymore. I told him that all his stuff was in the garage and he can find somewhere else to stay. I let him know that I have spoken to a family lawyer and I told him that when I feel ready and only when I feel ready will we see each other again and talk about the future arrangement with the kids. I said any further communication can be done through my sister in law or my brother. I said, he is allowed to see the kids but only at their place. I am of course wanting full custody of the children because it hurts too much to give him anything at this point. 

He agreed to all my points because he knew he was in the wrong. He tried to say sorry and then I absolutely lost my shit and screamed, NO FUCKING NO WAY ARE YOU SORRY, FOR 10 FUCKING YEARS YOU HAVE BOTH DECEIVED EVERYONE WE KNOW. Please take your shit and leave and tell that woman you have been fucking for 10 years that I do not ever want to see her fucking face again. 

Certainly not my shining moment but also a culmination of all the hurt and anger over the last few weeks that they have caused. I have no intention of talking to my ex best friend or really to my soon to be ex husband until I have had the time to grieve. 

So thank you community for the encouragement and advice. Hope I can heal and move on from this.",1,1731571519.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False
1gr0130,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharteredAccountants/comments/1gr0130/icai_and_nfra/,ICAI AND NFRA,"The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) are currently in disagreement over the revision of audit standards, particularly SA 600. This standard deals with the responsibility of principal auditors in assessing the work done by auditors of subsidiaries and related entities. NFRA is proposing changes to make principal auditors accountable for auditing subsidiaries in addition to the parent company. This shift comes in response to NFRA findings in cases like Coffee Day Enterprises, where audit oversights in subsidiaries led to significant unreported issues, prompting NFRA to advocate for stricter requirements‚Äã.

ICAI opposes this change, arguing that India's audit ecosystem, with a large number of smaller auditing firms, could be disrupted. They assert that the responsibility for subsidiary audits should not fall on principal auditors to the same extent it does in countries with more centralized audit structures. ICAI also questions NFRA's authority in this space, especially over standards like Quality Management Standards (SQMs), which ICAI believes should be within its regulatory purview rather than NFRA‚Äôs. ICAI has raised these concerns with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, defending their right to issue SQMs independently.

This debate raises broader questions about regulatory boundaries and the future of auditing in India, with both bodies aiming to improve audit reliability but differing on approach. The final decision from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs will likely influence the standards and responsibilities of auditors nationwide.",1,1731571488.0,CharteredAccountants,1,1.0,False

TL;DR a dream changed my life that was going in a downhill spiral. Because of that dream I live a successful life today, and I will never take them for granted again. 


When I was a child I was extremely sickly and flatlined on 3 separate occasions due to asthma attacks. Thankfully each time the hospitals were good and got me back up and running like a 1993 Corolla that refuses to die and has spent two generations with first time drivers. I eventually out-grew  the asthma and haven‚Äôt carried an inhaler since i owned an L.L. Bean backpack. My mom and dad never baptized me, because they thought I should make that decision when I was old enough. My dad‚Äôs side was catholic, or at least in name only. My mother‚Äôs side was Methodist, but again in name only. Neither side ever brought me to church, unless it was to help out at a charity event for the community. Plus the state I grew up in was not the most religious.  

Both families had a strong history of military service and my dad‚Äôs side had traced it back to England, our last name appeared after the Norman invasion of 1066. My first name is the same city in which my family was given land for bravery in battle by William the Conqueror. A random chance because neither parent planned that as my dad wanted a Jr, and my mom wanted another name entirely so they settled on the name I have now. 

Growing up I was a cautious kiddo due to my asthma and had a lot of fears but the only one I still have is fear of Catholic Churches. A fact I kept hidden in my teenage years as to not be seen as some weird kid, making things up. But genuinely they frighten me, I am fine with most new Protestant churches for whatever reason. As I got older and noticed that the fear never went away, I started to look into it.  

I found that this was called Ecclesiophobia, and for me it‚Äôs a feeling of paranoia and claustrophobia mixed, which oddly enough I‚Äôm not claustrophobic in general. When I turned 19, I got a security job where I worked third shifts in a catholic hospital(ironic, isn‚Äôt it?) as security in the psychiatric ward.  Had a few close calls with patients sectioned for homicidal thoughts, but got lucky, which became my nickname from the other guards. I was strangled with a hospital remote and stabbed with a buck knife by a drunk patient the cops brought in to sober up. After these close calls I started getting really vivid out of body experiences when I fell asleep in the morning after work. I didn‚Äôt talk about them much and at the time I was dating a staunchly catholic girl, who would tell me that if I didn‚Äôt get baptized we would never be able to marry. Let alone tell her about these dreams. I assume you can piece together how that went, given I‚Äôm on this sub Reddit. So I kept them reserved for conversations with my closest friends. 

I chalked it up to being exhausted from school and work at first, however it‚Äôs been 11 years and although the dreams are not as frequent as they once were they still come around here and there. In college, I had a friend who had told me that he would kill for an out of body experience and that most people need to use a hallucinogen to achieve them. Oddly enough they never frightened me and I could never tell what they meant. I just figured a side effect from those days in the psych ward or stress in general.

That is until a few years ago, I had an out of body experience that made it hard for me to ignore. I was at a bonfire deep in the woods with a close friend of mine. Something we would do almost routinely. After a long night of drinking and eating, I drifted off to sleep on a log that we carved into a pretty comfy bench. It was a dream like no other. I watched as I looked over me, peacefully sleeping, the pine needles around me turned to sea, and the log I slept on turned into a raft. It was sunny and I was adrift, everything was calm. 

Whatever was going on I enjoyed it, and so did the version of me I saw sitting on the raft. Until I saw fear in my face, I looked in the direction I saw myself looking and saw a dark cloud. It came with waves much taller than I have ever seen in real life. Waves taller than the coast guard commercials you see on tv. Suddenly the feeling of panic came over me, even though I was not on the raft, I could see myself that was on the raft and our feeling was one. 

The clouds darkened the sun, and the raft was splintered by one big wave, I watched as I saw myself holding onto one of the logs trying to stay above water, being tossed around like a leaf on a windy day. Over and over again, wave after wave. Until finally it went dark. I could no longer see myself, or anything for that matter. I felt cold, but comfortable. No longer panicked. A feeling I haven‚Äôt felt since my last asthma attack when I slipped under in an ambulance. 

Then I heard someone, a man, who sounded old and sturdy, not frail. He told me that peace comes at a great price and to sit idly by, was allowing a storm to brew. Then the next thing I remember I was awake with morning dew on my face from the grass and the trees, my jacket damp, my jeans cold. 

My friend was still asleep and it was 6am. So I figured id let him sleep a bit longer, grabbed my fishing pole out of the truck and walked down to the pond a little farther in the woods. I had a cigarette and tried to ignore the dream I had the night before. Up until then my outer body dreams never spoke to me, and most were nonsense. Me just watching myself do mundane tasks or watching an old memory of mine from afar. But this one was different. 

My friend was waking up when I got back to the truck and was putting the rod away. Albeit, I may have let the tailgate down a little hard to encourage his slumber to end. He woke up and we drove back to his house to shower and get ready for the day, and went out to eat at a local diner. I was reluctant to tell him about the dream but eventually I did. He told me that I should talk to someone about these dreams. 

Given my then girlfriend‚Äôs reactions to conversations like this in the past and my general fear for churches I ruled out any abrahamic religion as a start. I talked to my hippie friend from college who had been friends with some Wiccan‚Äôs and pagans back in college. I decided that it would be a safe enough place to discuss my dreams with them. 

I told them the story, as I‚Äôve told you that have read it. The answers to my dreams no more clearer than the dream itself. Some said a dream of death was not a good sign, but death didn‚Äôt make sense. I was healthy as a bull at that time. Yeah sure, I participated in the occasional drink and smoke a cigarette now and then but I went to the gym regularly, worked a relatively safe blue collar job, and was young. Others told me they could only offer advice but didn‚Äôt feel comfortable interpreting a dream like this because the meanings could be plentiful and they weren‚Äôt dream interpreters for their respected beliefs.

I appreciated their honesty and hospitality. They did not write me off like some mad man, which was refreshing from my norm. One of them did point out that they believed it was more of a warning of things to come, and not of death in particular since that was never shown in my dream, and the warning in which the old man gave me. 

The one who provided me with this explanation was an Asatruar as she called it, a practitioner of Asatru. Occasionally we would meet and she educated me in the basics of what she believed in. From the get go, it sounded like a belief that made a whole lot more sense than what I‚Äôve heard my girlfriend preach at me. She provided me with enough education to start to know where to look for more information, and not information that has been tainted by hate groups.  

Eventually her and I, stopped hanging out due to schedule conflicts but the information she gave me was invaluable. Fast forward a year,  and it happens. My dream was set into motion. My girlfriend of almost a decade leaves me 2 days before Christmas, up and moves about 1,300 miles (roughly 2,100km for my Euro friends) away. No heads up, nothing. I find out the day of that ahead of time had been planning this for a year. 

I fell hard and fast, drinking became constant, reckless behavior was a daily occurrence. My relatively safe job became anything but, and I was a walking OSHA violation. It came to a head one day and I‚Äôm not sure what all happened, and my friend still has never told me. But I woke up on that log again, no dreams this time,  after a long night of drinking and eating. He was awake. Alert even. 

Staring at me, as if he was watching me pull a block out of a 6ft tall jenga tower. I asked him if he was good and he said yeah. We drove back to his house, no music, no fishing, and the only thing to interrupt the silence was the pounding of my headache. When we pulled into his drive, he stopped me before we went in and he asked if I was okay. I looked at him like he was crazy and said that I was fine, why wouldn‚Äôt I be?

I went inside and showered, combed my hair, brushed my teeth and went back to his living room, he was sitting there. My Smith and Wesson 686 revolver I kept in a lock box secured safely under my truck seat on his coffee table. He asked me again, if I was okay. Confused I asked him why he had my gun on his coffee table, and he just asked me again if I was okay. I answered yes, and he handed me my gun, reached in his end table draw and pulled out a ziplock baggy with six shiny .357 rounds dancing about in it. Handed them to me and said he had to get ready for the day. I locked the gun back up and left, a very quiet ride home. 

I do not know what happened, quite frankly I don‚Äôt want to know what happened. However I know it was a dark time in my life. I scheduled a therapist appointment the very next day, and quit drinking after that. The therapist helped me a lot, I was able to see things differently because of her and it helped me bury the past and emotions that hadn‚Äôt been properly dealt with yet. 

Although, I‚Äôd like to think that the dream was what was able to snap me out of it as quick as I did. Many can not share the same sentiment, I was stuck in that storm that I was warned about, I was sedentary not prepared for any change and if I wanted peace again, I needed to get my raft away from the storm. 

So I reached out to friends I had made in the army, and through them I found my friends who convinced me to move and start anew. Well it‚Äôs been 3 years as of this month, since I turned my raft away from the storm and moved 700 miles away (About 1,130 km). I stopped being complacent. I work a fulfilling career helping others, where I am truly happy. I am finishing up my masters degree. If I have a drink, it‚Äôs never with an empty heart and always with a clear head, I own a home. I am happily married to someone who accepts me and my beliefs even if she does not share them, and I will never ignore another dream again. 

Was it Odin, Thor, or one of the many other Aesir or Vanir gods?  I do not know. But I appreciate the wisdom and foresight from it all the same. As a former gunsmith, locksmith, mechanic & glazier I have always appreciated the wisdom I have learned while working in the trades from those older than me and I continue to appreciate the wisdom I have learned from the gods. If you‚Äôve read to the end, thank you for spending time out of your day to read a little of my story.

I have always enjoyed drip coffee as a morning routine ig. french press and making ice coffees with frothed milk etc. but I'm no expert and at the end of the day, I just need a consistent cup that hits the spot. I have been looking and it seems like the Bambino is everyone's ""go-to"" for first-timers, easy to use, lower price point, and out-of-the-box experience. cool... But as I have been surfing the web (especially in this sub) I am getting more and more indecisive as to whether I should spend some more $ and get something nicer. 

**1st concern** is money, I'm a college student but living with my family who are well off, so I'm not sure I can pay for it outright but a few hundred shouldn't stop me from getting something better- they would gladly chip in for something nicer for the family and better quality etc. (plus Christmas and black Friday are coming) 

**2nd concern** is reliability/quality. I want something that isn't going to break in a year, and if it does... does it offer a warranty? and in general, not a plastic toy that I'll realize is a joke a few months down the road. or that can barely hold the pressure to make something decent.

\-desire for easy 8/10  
\-budget 500-900? total (ish)  
\- desire for name brand or high end machine 4/10

*some questions you might be able to answer other than buying advice:*   
1. Why does the grinder have more importance over the machine (I'm sorta finding this out-please clarify)?   
2. Will I really be able to tell the difference on all these machines... will it actually have an impact on taste? or are they just nice features like visuals, noise, speed etc? Could you clarify why/what people are spending more on?   
3. what do you recommend I do/learn before getting an espresso machine?  
4. Or what do you wish you got earlier/instead of?   


**and finally...** What machine/grinder/setup, do you recommend for me? (knowing that maybe I can get it one big ticket purchase and upgrade the other things later)

These folks go above and beyond every day, so why not surprise them with a thoughtful gift that says ‚Äúthank you‚Äù? Here are some ideas that I think teachers would genuinely appreciate:

**1. Handwritten Thank You Cards from Students**  
It‚Äôs simple, but teachers love hearing directly from their students. Ask your child to write a note or even draw a picture sharing something they love about their teacher. This kind of keepsake often means more than any store-bought gift.

**2. Gift Cards**  
You can‚Äôt go wrong here! Consider gift cards for coffee shops (Starbucks, Dunkin‚Äô), bookstores (Barnes & Noble, Amazon), or even popular stores like Target. Teachers can always use a little ‚Äúme time‚Äù treat or pick up supplies they need for their classroom.

**3. Cozy Blankets or Scarves**  
It‚Äôs the season for warmth! A soft blanket or scarf makes a thoughtful and practical gift, especially as the weather gets colder. Look for something in a neutral color that‚Äôs easy to pair with any wardrobe.

**4. Personalized Tote Bags**  
Teachers are always carrying books, supplies, and who knows what else! A cute tote bag with a personal touch‚Äîmaybe their name, or even a motivational quote‚Äîcould be something they‚Äôd use every day.

**5. Classroom Supplies Restock Kit**  
It might sound boring, but teachers often end up buying their own supplies. Create a little ‚Äúrestock kit‚Äù with dry-erase markers, colorful pens, post-its, or anything else you know they frequently use in the classroom.",1,1731569808.0,parcelsofjoy,0,1.0,False

Someone convinced me to give this show a second chance and i pushed through season one and now I'm on season 2 episode 4.


Let me just say, this show is wild.


I feel like Mariah specifically has a specific brand of paranoia that is so interesting to me. She thinks everyone is switching up on her despite no evidence shown to us stating otherwise so it's so hard to sympathise. Her friendship with quad ending is so sad, especially because in season 1 Quad was her only friend, and after she proclaimed she's not interested in being around Kari and Toya. I've watched housewives and the second one cast decides to ice other members out, it never ends well.



And speaking of Kari, thank heavens she's gone. There's something that irked me about her and I was not a fan of her being a full-time cast.


I can already see Toya has some excessive spending habits. When her man is like ""are you gonna get a job"" and she's like ""what do i need a job for?"" Girl you're throwing extravagant parties for a 2 year old who won't remember it and you just wanna spend spend spend. Even her step dad is telling her to calm down.


I LIKE SIMONE! When I watch these reality tv shows, i never feel like I'd be friends with any of these women, but i feel like I would not find Simone unpleasant if we knew each other. I'd tolerate having coffee with her! Her beef with Toya seems weird though. I wonder if there's any underlying issues.


Now, Heavenly. As soon as she said ""women should not be in positions of power"" and she was not joking,I knew she was a bit...odd... I see how her daughter acts and her daughter has a strong confident personality. That girl will not let her partner walk over her, or any one for that matter, so it's weird to see Heavenly think women should be submissive. I have a very strong personality so maybe that's why she's hitting a nerve with that submissive stuff. I do appreciate the back and forth she has with Jackie though!

We went down to Seattle to visit a friend, with the side intention of scoping out the city for when I graduate to see if we could live there (I plan to work in tech).

Long story short, we disliked the city. We found it depressing, I want to know from locals if these complaints are valid or if we just missed something.

1. Sketchy. In our first day, a homesless person yelled at my girlfriend as we were crossing the street, we saw several people smoking crack. To be fair I heard Pioneer Square is a bad spot and most cities have spots to avoid.
2. Falling apart. I found a lot of urban decay, we stayed in DT / SLU / Cap Hill area. Mix of abandoned buildings and high rises in construction. The vibe RADICALLY changes block by block.
3. Bad Transit. Buying bus tickets was a bit weird (can't pay by card, weird for a tech city), every time we tried to show tickets the bus driver would just wave us in. Like what?
4. People don't dress well. You can dress how you want, we were just a bit taken aback.
5. Known for good cafes, but every major city has good 3rd wave coffee spots now.
6. I hear that Seattle is known for its nature, admittedly we didn't see much and the nearest hike was a 45 min drive. I concede that we didn't make a huge effort to experience it and that Vancouver has spoiled us.
7. Eating out was generally very expensive. So were the lime bikes / scooters, like $15 to bike to gasworks.
8. The Amazon campus area felt super dystopian, like all these badge holders clocking into unmarked black buildings, then returning home to their AirBnB-looking condos next door. Presumably all the new high rises will contain Amazon employees.

The best thing about Seattle was the people. Y'all were friendly and welcoming, but what has happened to your poor city? I have a soft spot for 2nd tier US cities (SF, LA, NY are too much for me), but I left Seattle being reminded of Phoenix, where the best things about Phoenix lie outside the city. Feel free to hate, just trying to reconcile with a city that I really wanted to like but left feeling disappointed.

1gqzi29,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1gqzi29/my_results_with_laughland_teeth_whitening_worth_it/,My Results with Laughland Teeth Whitening ‚Äì Worth It?,"Like a lot of people, I‚Äôd tried different teeth whitening methods over the years with pretty mixed results. Some products worked a little but left my teeth so sensitive I couldn‚Äôt keep using them. Others didn‚Äôt work at all! When I first came across **Laughland Teeth Whitening** on Reddit, I was skeptical but curious. I‚Äôd read about their **dentist-formulated approach** and the promise of no sensitivity, which was a huge plus for me.

So here‚Äôs my full experience after using Laughland teeth whitening, including what I liked, the results, and whether I‚Äôd recommend it. If you‚Äôve been scrolling through **laughland teeth whitening reddit** posts like I was, hopefully, this post gives you some useful insights!

# First Impressions: Simple and Professional

When my Laughland kit arrived, I was impressed by how well-organized everything was. The box included the **whitening gel applicators**, a USB-powered LED mouthpiece, and clear **instructions**. I‚Äôve tried other kits that felt messy and complicated, but this one felt like it was thoughtfully put together. The instructions were super straightforward, which I appreciated.

Basically, you:

1. Brush and dry your teeth
2. Apply the whitening gel
3. Use the LED mouthpiece for about 10 minutes

That‚Äôs it! Each session only takes a few minutes, so it was easy to fit it into my routine. Plus, the LED light added a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù feel to it, like I was getting a real treatment instead of just using strips.

# Results After the First Few Days

I didn‚Äôt expect huge changes right away, but by the third day, I noticed my teeth looking a little brighter. Not blindingly white, but a noticeable improvement. The **Laughland instructions** say to use the kit daily for the best results, so I kept it up, curious to see how it would turn out by the end of the week.

What really stood out to me was the lack of sensitivity. I was half-expecting my teeth to hurt by day 3, based on past experiences with other products, but I felt nothing! It was comfortable to use, which is honestly a game-changer for me because most products make my teeth ache. Seeing this was already a win in my book.

# End of Week 1: Bigger Changes Than I Expected

By the end of the first week, the results were impressive. My teeth were at least 5 or 6 shades whiter. It wasn‚Äôt like I had a ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù smile overnight, but the difference was clear. Laughland even worked on some of the deeper stains I thought were permanent. This was probably the biggest surprise for me because I‚Äôd tried so many things that didn‚Äôt reach these kinds of results.

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that I drink coffee every day, so my teeth have always been a bit stained from it. But Laughland seemed to tackle even the tougher coffee stains without making my teeth feel sensitive or uncomfortable.

# Why I Think Laughland Stands Out

The **laughland teeth whitening reddit** reviews I read before buying weren‚Äôt exaggerating. Here are a few reasons I think this product actually works better than others I‚Äôve tried:

1. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: Laughland is stored in a temperature-controlled facility, which means the whitening gel stays potent and doesn‚Äôt weaken before you get it. Other products often lose effectiveness before you even start using them, but Laughland‚Äôs gel was as strong as advertised.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: I was skeptical about the LED light at first, but it really seemed to enhance the results. The light helps activate the gel, making the whitening process faster and more effective. I think this is a big reason why I saw results so quickly.
3. **No Sensitivity Formula**: This is a huge deal for me. Laughland uses hydrogen peroxide like other teeth whiteners but has additional ingredients that balance it out so it‚Äôs not harsh. I never felt any discomfort, which made me stick to the routine daily without dreading it.

# Final Thoughts and Who It‚Äôs For

If you‚Äôre looking for a way to whiten your teeth without making them sensitive, **Laughland Teeth Whitening** is definitely worth a try. It‚Äôs easy to use, doesn‚Äôt take a lot of time, and the results speak for themselves. My teeth are now noticeably whiter, and the results have actually lasted without much fading, even with my daily coffee habit.

I know a lot of people are cautious about teeth whitening because of all the sensitivity issues, but with Laughland, that wasn‚Äôt a problem. If you‚Äôve been browsing **laughland teeth whitening reddit** for honest experiences, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs one of the few products that does what it claims.

**Curious to try Laughland yourself? Check it out** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Pros of Laughland Teeth Whitening:

* **Quick Results**: Whiter teeth in just 6 days
* **Sensitivity-Free**: Safe for sensitive teeth
* **Simple Routine**: Only 10 minutes a day

Overall, I‚Äôm happy with my results and would recommend **Laughland teeth whitening** to anyone looking for a real change in their smile without the hassle or discomfort. It‚Äôs worth giving a shot if you‚Äôre tired of products that don‚Äôt deliver or leave your teeth feeling sore.

If you have questions or want more details, feel free to ask! I‚Äôm glad I took a chance on Laughland, and I hope this post helps anyone else who‚Äôs curious about it.",1,1731569051.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

Dave And The Ladies Agree To Leave Shiela A Slave Until All Of Ari's Moles Are Flushed, Mistress Nora Ressurects Sheila's Slave Blog, Wants To Force A Bitchsuit And Piercings On Her.","Sandy's perspective. 

Constance and I are sitting in Dave's Limo on a Zoom call with Dave, Layla, Lara, Sarah and Nora. ""I just don't believe Sheila would do something like that. It has to be a frame job."" Dave said ""I don't think she would either, our IT department is working on it, but I think she'll be cleared. Unfortunately, a certain young lady, who Sheila has done so much for, decided she did believe it. And decided to call Sheila while she was being trained by Mistress Dao and Mary. So now they know, too.""

He turned to glare at Nora sitting to his left, probably the angriest I've ever seen him. Nora shrank, but didn't have anywhere to turn for sympathy. Layla was sitting to her left also glaring at her. Both Lara and Sara were glaring around Layla at her as well. She looked like a naughty little girl who caught hell from Dad, Mom and both big sisters. If I knew the Perseverance crew, that's probably what happened.

Then Dave sighed. ""What's done is done, now we have to make our next move."" I glared pointedly at the screen ""Which is?"" He looked at me irritated. Sheila told me working with a bevy of strong women for years had softened his misogony. But I could tell he was still mad at this little slip of a girl impatiently hurrying him to make his point. Tough buster! This is my sister we're discussing!

Then he takes a deep breath and is calm again. ""Ladies, is there anyone  of you who thinks Ari didn't have something to do with this?"" It hadn't even occured to me, but yeah it made sense. I looked at Constance and could tell she believed that. Nora looked suprised and guilty, like she realized she should have thought of that before she confronted poor Sheila. Layla, Lara and Sarah were all nodding, like it made sense now that it was mentioned.
""And if they can plant a thumb drive in Sheila's desk Ari has a spy in a trusted position in our camp.""

Now there was murmuring on Dave's side of the pick up as the girls looked around at each other. Then Layla looked at me directly on the screen. A liitle too fixedly, a little too long. WTF, Layla you think I'd spy for Ari after years as her abused little slave?

""Ladies."" Dave's firm intonation quieted the murmurings. All eyes on him. ""I'd stake my reputation and fortune on our betrayer not being anyone in this present company. Which means we need to find out who it is, how many there are, and stop these monkey games once and for all.""

I knew what he had in mind and beat him to the punch. ""You want to extend Sheila's Slave sentence, make them think we believe this hokey crap. Put them at ease so we can flush them out. While my sister suffers as our bait.""

Dave frowned. ""I don't like it young lady, but our livelihoods, our reputations, maybe our lives and safety are at stake. I wouldn't put anything past a sociopath like Ari, and neither should any of you. We'll all be better off, Sheila included, if we end this now. We extend her sentence, we let her think we believe she's guilty so her reactions have authenticity, and we conduct an active if clandestine investigation to catch this son of a bitch!"" He pounded his fist on the table, making all of us jump.

""Or daughter of a bitch. No misogony meant ladies. I hate doing this to Sheila, as I know all of you do. But I think she'll understand when it's all over and we explain it to her."" She probably would. Worse, she'd probably be quick to forgive all the humiliating things we had to do to her to make it ring of authenticity.

""So what exactly do we do now?"" I queried. Dave said ""I should have the results in an hour on where that thumb drive came from. If we're lucky, whoever typed up that bogus manifesto was careless, we can identify them, and wrap this up quickly. But I wouldn't count on it.""

""If we can't identify the culprit, I make a call to Sheila, tell her I'm disappointed and convinced she's guilty. I offer her to stay on as the lowest bottom slave, or be sued peniless and homeless. If she fulfills her contract as bottom slave and extra until the end of the Perseverance run, her salary will be put in an escrow account, with Lara as her finanancial manager and you, Sandy as her assistant. I'll say I'll give you girls lim
ited permission to splurge and party on her account, mostly for fan service humiliation videos. But that I'll make sure a sizeable sum is left for her. The day shooting of the last episode of the Perseverance wraps, she's a free woman, with a hefty pay check. Things could get dicey if she says no. I don't think she will.""

Then he looked at a sad faced, crying Nora. ""That's where you come in, Miss Chief Disciplinarian."" Nora looked up shocked. ""M-M-Me?"" Nora spluttered.

""Yes you, young lady, since you were so quick to claim a title I told you was purely hypothetical and maybe tip off a spy to our hand, we're going to put that to good use. QOM can't object to our slave's Chief Disciplinarian coming over to observe her training. it falls within the scope of your duties. You'll be accepting a copy of her certificate with Sandy when she's certified an acceptable bottom slave.

Nora still looked shocked. ""I'll try to go as easy on her as I can..."" she murmured, still in shock. Dave frowned. ""I appreciate your concern, young lady, but that won't do. Sometimes you'll have to be strict and cruel to make it look authentic. What you can do for her is use that brilliantly cruel mind to get her out of things without making it look obvious. If QOM's people suggest something painful and humiliating, counter with something humiliating but not painful. Sell it as the worse option for her, I know you can. Be a bitchy domme, but know how to keep her safe, even if it's not possible to go too easy on her.""

Nora's tears had dried, and she replied ""A Good big sister watches out for her little, even if she has to be harsh smetimes."" Dave nods ""You do understand, young lady. Do you have a long term domme plan as Sheila's Chief Disciplinarian if it takes awhile to catch all of Ari's moles?"" Now Nora looked confident and her smile seemed predatory. Even Dave seemed taken aback by the still often meek girl's poise. ""I do, actually."" She replied. Dave frowned but motioned her to continue.

""Revive Sheila's Slave Blog, with me as the administrator, though all of you can make posts when you feel like it. I'll take the lead on posting since I'm in charge of her discipline. Have her ""consent"" to lifting her bitchsuit hard limit. I'd also like to try some breast, vaginal and other piercings, maybe nose and belly rings...with her consent."" Her nasty smile said if Sheila didn't consent the easy way, she'd be consenting tied up in a room where the ""Cameras were down for maintenance.""

All of us on both sides of the screen went quiet, regarding her with renewed suspicion. She found the alleged offending thumb drive, and has a long term domme plan ready for Sheila. We always thought her collusion with Daci was unwitting and naive, and warranted no punishments beyond a few ass chewings. But what if-

To her credit, she read the room quick and her smile faded. ""Guys, I really enjoy topping,  and yes I've fantasized about domming Sheila and wrote some imaginary stories and ideas. Now that the reality is here, I hate making her suffer as much as you do. But you, Master Henson, said it had to look real. I can do that. I'll enjoy it a little. Okay, that's a lie, I'll enjoy it a lot. But Sheila's safety, wellbeing and freedom are my eventual goal. I'd never betray her, even if she's going to feel I did for awhile, or any of you.""

The speech eased the tension, but didn't eliminate it. Dave said ""I believe that young lady. Get your stuff together and your domme uniform ready."" Nora looked suprised at his knowledge. ""I know you, young lady, you have a custom uniform ready to go, if your fantasy of being put in charge of Sheila ever came true. It's a reality, so now you can use it. Have fun but look out for Sheila, that's your first priority, young lady.""

""Go get ready. When I get the call about the thumb drive, I'll call you. If we have to go forward, it's going to be shock and awe for poor Sheila. I'm going to Zoom call her and offer the choice of being fired and sued, or fulfilling her contract as a bottom slave. As soon as I sign off I'll text you, you'll be right outside the classroom Mary and Dao are keeping her. Make a sweeping, dramatic entrance. Show her the new Sheila's Slave Blog on your tablet. Go wild about bitchsuits, piercings and what have you, to keep her convincingly frightened and off balance. But know we're going to vote on every single one of your proposals before you implement them on her. Can you do that?""

Nora nodded ""Yes, I can."" Then she got up and left, seeming more excited and energized. ""I don't think she's Ari's mole."" Dave's understated bluntness looks like it gives us all some relief. Though we knew he would never give her so much authority over Sheila if he even suspected she was.

""However, she's having way to much fun with this. She's still a very troubled young woman. Sandy, remember you're still your sister's owner and lead trainer, you can step in anytime you feel it's warranted. Same for you Constance, you may be just an Alpha Slave, but you're my other good cop. I'll back any veto you give of something Nora has planned for Sheila. You're something of a mother figure to her, so I'm hoping you can talk sense into her when need be. Honestly, Sheila needs a bad cop to keep her in line, but I'm counting on my two good cops to keep it from going to far.""

Constance said ""Yes, Master Henson."" While I nodded and stated ""No problemo, Dave."" Then his phone buzzed, he looked at it and said ""Ah, the results on the thumbdrive are in, hope for good news, girls."" I had my fingers crossed we'd bust Ari's mole and have Sheila a free woman by sunset. It was not to be.

Sheila's perspective

""You were wise to take the deal, slave. You'll be adequately compensated for your service when the Perseverance ends. The girls will get a limited budget of your money to splurge on partying, mostly for fan service videos humiliating you. They may claim to be leaving you peniless as a form of findom, but believe me, you'll have a hefty balance to go your own way when you're done with us, just like you wanted.""
Dave paused and stared at me sadly from the screen, his disappointment more painful than my clamped nipples, swollen breasts or arms bindered behind my back.

I wanted to mmmph through my panel gag it was all a lie, please let me speak. But Mary had her cane across my breasts ready to punish me for trying to get even muffled words out in my defense. I'd been so hopeful when Dao announced my phone was ringing with news from Dave. Mary put her cane across my breasts as Dao put down the phone and swiped it for the video call. My breasts still hurt, but at least these cunts had taken off the leather straps so my circulation returned.

I eagerly greeted him ""Good Day, Master Henson, Sir!"" Though it came out ""Ood ae, aste ensin, ir!"" Through the panel gag and packing. I was so excited for the good news that would exonerate me. Then he stared at me a moment too long. With a really, sad disappointed face. I knew something was wrong.

""Sheila, this is the last sentence I'll ever use your first name in, though I'll call you Miss Connor when I sue you. If you take my offer, you're ""slave"" to me from now on. My offer is you can fulfill your contact by being a bottom slave and extra for the remaining run of the Perseverance. One mmmph and you're free to go, QOM's people will provide you some civilian clothes from their charity closet so Sandy and Constance can escort you in my limo back to the set. Layla, Lara and Sarah will have your things packed. You will retrieve  your belongings and security will escort you to the front gate. You will be barred from the premises for life.""

""Two mmmphs and you choose to fulfill your contract as our bottom slave. Layla will take your role as Top Domme permanently, Lara will take your role as Chief Script writer. Lara and Sandy will also be your financial managers. You will sign powers of attorney giving them authority over your property and finances while you fulfill your contract. Sandy will also still be your owner and lead trainer. Nora will be your Chief Disciplinarian and generally exercise authority over you on a daily basis, she'll essentially be your de facto domme who you'll look to for supervision and mentoring, though Layla and Sandy can veto her decisions.""

""Mary, give her a ten count. If she doesn't give a response, free her and escort her to the charity closet to select an outfit. Then take her to our limo, Sandy and Constance are on standby lnside. Sheila, once the count is done you can't change your mind. Mary, begin.""

Mary eagerly started counting down. ""10-9-8-7, come on we don't have all day slave. 6-"" what to do? Try to prove my innocence as a free woman but out of my friends lives? Or try as a slave, constantly restrained, supervised and denied basic rights? This mistake had to get cleared up, and I just had a feeling that would be easier if I was on the inside, even as a slave. I made my choice and mmmphed twice.

After Master Henson praised the wisdom of my choice, and assured me of my financial solvency if I honored my contract, he just stared at me sadly for a long moment. ""You may have guessed, this test was to certify Mary as an Alpha Slave, more than to certify you as a bottom one. The test will be extended several weeks so Mary gets a fair evaluation. Mistress Sandy will come and go. Don't worry, Chief Disciplinarian Nora will help oversee your training daily, she may even elect to stay on the premises. She has a lot of interesting ideas on how you can still be a moneymaker for us."" He signed off, it looked like he put his head in his hands right before.

I didn't have time to process anything before I heard a loud bang from the classroom door being thrown open. The school desk I was strapped to was facing away from the door so I couldn't see who it was. Mistress Dao and Alpha Slave Mary were in front of me, looking at me with shit eating grins, so it couldn't be them.

""Hey, bitch, did you miss me?!!"" My eyes widened as Mary and Dao laughed at my expression. Chief Disciplinarian Mistress Nora! She's here already? I heard a calculated stride of what I thought were jackboots. She wasn't hurrying, probably calculating each boot clack to strike fear in my heart. It was working.

When she finally came around the desk and looked down on me my heart was hammering in my chest. Her hands were on her hips as she smirked down on me. ""Hello, little girl, mommy's home!"" She gleefully exclaimed. 

What struck me was her domme outfit. Really more of a uniform. Black button down shirt, freshly pressed with sharp military creases. Open at the collar to show an immaculate Navy T-shirt. A Khaki web belt with gold buckle, a black flogger hoslstered at her left hip. Sharply creased khaki pants. Despite the racheting straps above and below my breasts, I strained to peer at her footwear. None of the three dommes reprimanded me. Looked like she was wearing jackboots.

I peered back up at her. A black b√©ret was perched perfectly on her smiling, pretty blond head. Now her smile turned warm and friendly. ""Do you like my outfit, slave? I put it together just to domme you!"" She turned around so I could get a full view.

Despite Mary's warning glare, I mmmphed twice for yes, with no reservations. I did like it. A lot. Inspite of the circumstances, I was getting wet. Little Slave Sheila and her Aryan Facist Mommy Nora. It was messed up, but damn could I feel a hot domme sub chemistry I never imagined with Nora!

Dao handed her a tablet and she sat in the swivel chair to my left. ""Is this Sheila's phone, girls?"" She looked down at the blank phone I'd forgotten about on the desk. Dao snatched it and said ""It's my phone, little slave gift it to me."" Now Nora's smile got mean again, as her and Dao exchanged a domme to domme look. ""Of course she did."" Nora's tone told me she knew it was a lie, but didn't give a fuck. My blood started to boil, but there was nothing I could do. Nothing at all.

I felt a poke on my left breast. Nora had prodded my left breast with the tablet stylus, which I saw she was putting back on the side of her tablet. ""Sheila, pay attention. Anyway, first order of business, we're bringing back Sheila's Slave Blog. I'm going to be the administrator, but people will be tuning in for you!""

No, not that stupid blog brought back to life. I told Nora how much I hated that fucking thing, more than all the physical tortures Ari put me through. Except maybe the bitchsuit. I looked at the banner, beneath Sheila's Slave Blog, A giant AI generated Nora held a miniature figure in her hand. The female figure was armbindered, hood masked, and strapped otherwise naked to a school desk. The giant Nora grinned sadistically at her mini charge, while the bound figure looked back at her in comically exaggerated, wide eyed terror. I guess that reflected our relationship now with accuracy.

""Read my first post!"" She scrolled up so I could read it.

Greetings BDSM Fans, 

I'm Nora Jameson, but you may know me as Commander Dora Gail of the Perseverance. I announce sadly that  Sheila Nguyen Connor has stepped down as Chief Screenwriter and Top Domme of the our beloved show. She cited mounting pressure and family stress as her reasons for stepping down.

The show will go on with Lara Rajaneesh Gupta promoted to Chief Script writer, and Layla Vasquez taking over as Top Domme. Sarah, Constance and I will all be staying in our original roles. Even Sheila has graciously agreed to stay on when we need extras to play bondage slaves.

But it gets better, as Sheila agreed to be my sub and help me relaunch Sheila's Slave Blog, under my direction. I'm grateful for this opportunity given to me by my cherished leader and mentor. I hope I can lead and train her as well as she did for me. My official title will be Chief Disciplinarian Nora Jameson, but to the slave, I'll usually just be Mistress Nora. 

What are we planning to do? What worked the first time, we'll ask you guys what you want! My first poll is if you want to see her back in a bitchsuit. It will be below for you guys to vote on!

I have ideas for getting her piercings, not just vaginal and breast, but maybe nose and navel. I think she'd look really cute with a nose ring, what do you guys think?
Send in your ideas for her, all of them! We'd love to use them. 

Warm Regards
Mistress Nora Jameson Chief Disciplinarian 
Of
Bottom Slave Sheila Nguyen Connor aka Loser Girl

I started mmmphing angrily, after a moment of shock at what I just read. I won't consent to being put back in a bitchsuit. And she's not giving me a single piercing! No! No! No! No! NO!

Nora calmly puts aside the tablet, with a stony face. Then she raises both fists as she stands up over me. I wiggle desperately, thinking she's going to hit me with a two hand punch I can't avoid. 

Instead both hands hit my desk in a double hammer fist that shakes the desk and jerks my nipple clamps. Hard. I start screaming through my musty underwear panel gag. My scream is cut off by a hand around my throat. Mistress Nora glares at me like a loathsome bug as I choke and gurgle.

""You backstabbing little bitch. You have no say in any of this. I and your fans decide what you do from now on. If they want you in a bitchsuit, I'll stuff you into one. If they want me to put a metal clit hood on you, and make you suck big black dick, you'll do it. You'll ""consent"" or I'll beat the brakes off you when the cameras are down for maintenance!""

Dao lightly taps her arm as my conciousness starts to fade. ""Killing pretty slave no good, release her, Mistress Nora."" I choke, sputter and desperately gulp the sweet air a domme cut me off from for the second time this day. Nora looks at her hand, then my neck, looking guilty. Are ligature marks forming on my neck?

Then her face goes placid again. ""I'm sorry, sweetie. You deserved to be punished, but it was undommelike of me to lose my temper and choke you.  We'll just chalk this up as a little lesson for both of us and move on, hmmm?""

As I still sputter, she picks up the tablet again and puts it back in my face like nothing happened. ""So the first piercing I want to get you is a Christina piercing. It's right below the vulva where the pussy lips meet. I think I'll put that poll beneath the bitchsuit poll.""

No, dammit, NO! NO! She can't do this to me. But right now, she can, and probably fucking will.

""In fact I want to make it as cute little pink lotus flower, since that's the national flower of Vietnam, and your half v
Viet, sweetie."" She giggles. ""It would be adorable when I made you give our fans a full frontal and they can see a cute pink flower nestled in your pussy lips, just peeking out.""

She shows me a few images of what a ""Christina"" Piercing looks like on a woman, then downloads one. She brings the blog up and shows the first poll question.

""Would you like to see Slave Sheila back in a bitchsuit?""

Second question.

Should I make Slave Sheila get a ""Christina"" piercing on her pussy?

Then she downloads the picture of the piercing below the question.

She opens a chat box so I can see the crude comments on both questions. Already the votes are coming in for both polls. You can guess not in my favor. I can only watch glumly and helplessly as once again, crude internet trolls decide my fate.

She puts the tablet down on the desk so I can see it. ""I need a cup of coffee. Is it true the French Vanilla in the Domme's lounge is the greatest?"" Dao replies ""Sure is, Mistress Nora, I'll take you there. Alpha Slave Mary, you watch our slave.""

""My pleasure, Mistress Dao. Enjoy your French Roast, Nora."" Nora replies brightly ""Thank you, Mary!"" Then she lets Dao lead her out.

Then she turns on me. ""I thought the little bitch did a number on me. She is really going to fuck you up. Enjoy your karma you fucking half race bitch!""

I stare glumly as the poll results come in. Crude assholes joke about putting the piercing on me, then getting me alone, and doing...other things to me. This is my future.

1gqzd0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gqzd0t/associationship_gone_awry/,‚ÄòAssociation‚Äô-ship gone awry?,"So let me preface this main interaction with a backstory:

Girl (who‚Äôs occasionally masculine presenting) messages me and I reply ‚ÄúHey guy!‚Äù When when I met her she was presenting masculine and it wasn‚Äôt until i saw on fb after she corrected me and told me how it deeply hurts her and I dove into seeing all sides of her on her fb. Right? I apologized and everything was well.

We had weird like ‚Äúshe said that you were rude to her‚Äù ‚Äúshe told me you made her feel uncomfortable‚Äù and these two 3rd party interactions happened like weeks later but back to back.  So, I got in my feelings and started like stressing about how she must think I hate her or think I‚Äôm discriminating her and I do not ever want anyone to feel like I hate them or feel like I‚Äôm judging them in any way, I have my own story and one thing I cannot deal with is when people think I got beef when I don‚Äôt have any.-
So I message her and I tell her that I‚Äôd love to grab a coffee sometime and we do and it goes well and she tells me about her dogs and I tell her about my collections and she tells me her story and I just listen. I open my ears and shut my mouth and take it in and when shes done I thank her for sharing with me that part of her. We hug we go on our separate ways.

Some 5 odd months later after only connecting through Snapchat with emojis or whatever anyways, I‚Äôm tripping HARD in a dive bar and I‚Äôm enjoying myself and her and her friend come up and she was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the problem I heard you had a problem with me‚Äù I turn around with the biggest smile on my face and I see that it dearms her a little bit but I am all over the place like ‚Äúhey girl I don‚Äôt have a problem with you at why would you think that and I love this teal on you it‚Äôs electric and me and [SO] are having an argument I just had surgery‚Äù she cuts me off with ‚Äúnone of that is my business‚Äù and I said ‚Äúyeah I know but you asked me questions and I‚Äôm answering the best I can I‚Äôm really sorry I‚Äôm tripping balls right now‚Äù she all of a sudden turns like.. nice? And she says ‚Äúwell get it girl but we are women and we have each others backs solely because of that‚Äù and she hugs me and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling the love in here thank you for clearing the air with me I love you‚Äù or some off the wall high vibes thing, right? Anyways, I thought we were cool and a part of me that was worried about that was out to reat that evening. 


Tonight she hugged me, said a greeting to me, that once, she said ‚Äúooo I like that‚Äù when I used it on her. And went on about her day had a meal and left. Everything was swell until I get screen shots of her telling other girls in a long time group chat that‚Äôs she‚Äôs in with my COUSIN‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI told her I wasn‚Äôt going to be talking to her‚Äù ‚Äúcome laugh really loud with me and make a scene‚Äù ‚ÄúCALLING ALL GALLS‚Äù. I‚Äôve told my cousin the interactions we‚Äôve had and she‚Äôs just like ‚Äúyeah, she‚Äôs messy‚Äù and so like cool but idk‚Ä¶ my feelings are hurt and I just wanna love and trust and recently a theme in my therapy is about how my boundaries are essential to not being hurt by my own understanding of humans because I truly wanna live in a perfect world of love and light and‚Ä¶ idk I really get my self image wrapped up in people hating me. My therapist told me people would hate me for being authentic but I‚Äôve worked for 8 years trying be the most authentic me I can be an unapologetically and idk I feel like I have nice tool box for dealing with these feelings I just hate feeling this way. Once I got caught trying to be sneaky by some people that I truly care about and they were mad and I literally stayed up all night making the most bomb Mac and cheese and ham and mashed potato plates like‚Ä¶ (LOL) I‚Äôm just in my head I think. 

 Am I crazy? Because also with a second surgery I just needed I do feel like I‚Äôm down. I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôm in pain and I‚Äôm missing some pieces of me that I hold dear to my womanhood especially because I dont have any children yet. I think it could all play a role. Also I‚Äôm in this state where sometimes I wonder if this is real life like with the holidays coming up, I disassociate and self medicate and spiral eventually. Normally it doesn‚Äôt happen until decorating for Christmas comes but I feel like this small thing should bother me but it does‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs heavy. But it‚Äôs also fresh. 

Btw my doctor just gave me Prozac I‚Äôm scared to take it I‚Äôm scared to be thrown for a loop when I come off it. He gave it to me based on my symptoms of self medicating and the down but antsy feelings I get this time of year. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll love it I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll hate it I also carry trauma related to medication and so if you take it drop your experience. I also take a higher dose stimulant for adhd which has changed my life but did take me 4 years to even consider trying and 1 year saying I‚Äôd take it and 1 year at 15mg and 6mo at 30mg and almost 2 years later I‚Äôm at 70mg and it‚Äôs.. changed my life 

I see my therapist tomorrow if you were wondering (LOL)

Thanks for coming to my trauma dump 

TLDR: girl has beef but I gots none. She hurt my feelings when I saw what she said to other girls, intentionally trying to put me down or make me feel outted but she claimed to be confrontational with me but she actually side hugged me. I just wanna take her home and snuggle up on the couch with her and watch a movie or talk girl talk idk what is happening. *sharp inhale*",2,1731568430.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

There‚Äôs this cute girl in one of my classes that I really want to talk to but I don‚Äôt really know how to or if it‚Äôs even a good idea at all. The thing is that she sits kinda far away from me and everyone pretty much has set seats that they sit at atp and she tends to always sit next to this other girl so I can‚Äôt really randomly go sit next to her bc that would just be weird. I was thinking of maybe trying to approach/talk to her one time after class as we‚Äôre walking out. But then idk if I should tell her I think she‚Äôs cute and ask if she‚Äôd be down to grab coffee or just ask her something about class. The latter is obviously more natural but I also feel like if I‚Äôm not direct about the fact that I‚Äôm interested in her it might just end up as a one time convo and then I wouldn‚Äôt know where to go from there.
I realize it probably would‚Äôve been better to try to talk to her in class closer to the beginning of the semester in a casual/friendly way first to gauge if she‚Äôd be open to talking to me in general, but I didn‚Äôt do that unfortunately and now there‚Äôs only 2 weeks left in the sem so I feel like I‚Äôd have to be more direct about it.
I‚Äôve looked for similar questions that have been asked in this and other subreddits and there doesn‚Äôt really seem to be a consensus as to whether or not it‚Äôs an acceptable thing to do. I understand that it can be annoying for women to be approached all the time and I definitely don‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable or make her feel creeped out or anything.

We began our meal with some snacks, and a staff member approached to ask if we‚Äôd like wine to accompany them. We politely declined, mentioning that we‚Äôd already chosen a non-alcoholic beverage pairing. The staff member then offered a non-alcoholic option to pair with the snacks. Assuming this was part of our tasting menu or included in the beverage pairing, we agreed. However, we later discovered we were charged $22 per glass for this drink‚Äîwhich contained barely two sips‚Äîand, to our surprise, it was already part of the beverage pairing. Essentially, we paid extra to try the same drink twice.

The main courses and desserts were excellent. But then, with the petit fours, the staff offered tea or coffee to go with them. Perhaps due to our inexperience, we assumed that, given the premium price of the tasting menu, tea or coffee would be included. Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt. We were charged $15 for a small, pre-steeped cup of tea that tasted like little more than hot water.

At no point did the staff inform us these items would incur additional charges, nor was it indicated on the menu.

While the food and service were otherwise outstanding, the subtle upselling left a sour note. 

I‚Äôm planning to visit another two-star restaurant in London, The Clove Club, and have read similar reviews about upselling there.

Would greatly appreciate hearing about similar experiences and any advice on handling these situations more effectively!

There were so many days I was so fucking fed up with being sick. I was either pushing myself way too hard through life and things; what my ego told me I had to do, and I forced myself to do things, whether it was just for a walk, to do my makeup and go have sex so I could make financial ends meet, or see a friend, well people or ‚Äôfriends,‚Äô that would make my self sabotage feel okay, so it was like validation for my toxic traits. On the other hand there were so many days that I wasted away, rotting in the corner of my bed, my belly the size of a basketball, my neck pounding full of toxins and heat and inflammation, sweat dripping down my body and internal dreadful doom which absolutely annihilated me in every way possible. There were so many days I yelled PLEASE TAKE ME OUT. TAKE ME THE FUCK OUT OF THIS LIFE. I REALLY REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE HERE. 

> I didn‚Äôt want to be conscious, I didn't want to be me, I didn‚Äôt want to have to deal with my failures, I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the same. Old. healing. Again and again and again and again. I just wanted to live. But I think I've realized that I wanted to live without learning from my mistakes, I wanted to live easily, without discipline, and just continue down a road that would eventually probably would have killed me. I didn‚Äôt want to live, because I hated myself and I didn‚Äôt want to actually do the work. I didn‚Äôt want to accept that I needed to accept even more truths and realities. I didn‚Äôt want to accept what set me apart from others, so that I could just live limitlessly with those who actually didn‚Äôt have limitations whether it be because of hidden truths, they were stuck in addiction, they were chasing things that I didn‚Äôt intend to chase with them, etc. The list goes on. I tried to distract myself by constantly accepting plans every week with the man I kept on telling myself that I had fallen for because he was all I had. And he truly was all I had, as I slowly began to turn to him first before anyone else and for more and more things. But I had to eventually stop lying to myself because as much as I adored his presence, as much as I appreciated him and as much as I just wanted to spend hours talking to him and could call him at any time and he would pick up, because I realized that he was my best friend and I saw him as my best friend, not a future husband, like in turn he saw me as the love of his life. I slowly over time began to have less and less energy for anything, as if my my body was just completely rejecting my ‚Äòpast life‚Äô or a past lifestyle that the universe or God was calling me out of, in order to align with one that would 
 So much of what you see everywhere is filled with ideas and visuals and images of peoples lives that you A)  have no place to judge or B) can't compare yourself too because you don't know what they sacrificed to have that. Hints of my upcoming ultimate bottom, arose and manifested through the slow burn of strep throat, colds, and swollen tonsils. Then almost every single morning it felt like a thousand bricks were weighing my body down, and even my mind as I couldn't really think about anything, I couldn't make rational decisions, I couldn't think for myself anymore and that was when I knew, okay I have got to surrender and let go. I would get up, make a morning beverage and take care of myself, and after a few steps fall back into bed and just try to stay as calm as I possibly could. It was calm and reassuring at the same time as being utterly devastating and disturbing because I was aware of how fragile, weak and frail I was and that was the truth. It next hit a point of a complete mind and body shut down and my body would react from almost literally anything. From a drop of alcohol, a kiss of a cigarette, a single blow of a row, to then noise, stimuli, movement, a crumb of food, a sip of anything hot, and basically just any beverage that wasn't either pure water, coffee or lemon and salt. After walking around, being up fro an hour or so and then 10 minutes down the road of driving I could already feel my weakness begin to crawl back all over my body, as my lymph nodes began to swell back up, the water retention in my ankles, the belly swelling, the brain fog and the exhaustion. The worst part about all of this was that I couldn‚Äôt escape it, I couldn‚Äôt escape my own body and that was exactly what it felt like I wanted to do, and no one should ever have to feel that way about their body, their own selves. So to add on to that, I couldn‚Äôt escape my body, but the second I tried to just quit, surrender and lay down or sleep, I couldn't because my mind would go wild, jumping from the wait i need this or that medicine first and the fears of not doing some sort of attempt of activity to get better or healing strategy, because I was afraid that if I did not, I would get worse, and progress and everything would hit me like a truck again so these moments sparked the hyper vigilant in me, the taking action to do yoga, breathe work, dry brushing exercises, body massages, make detoxifying foot baths, soaking my face in ice water, showering between hot and cold also showers that consisted of furious and wild scrubbing, the scrubbing of my whole body, the shaving every hair that existed on my body that wasn't my head, every hole and crevice to be cleaned, because I was filthy, sick and I needed to be or at least feel as clean as possible (realized later this was a mental illness) But I slowly, slowly started to regain at least a little bit of my power back, the first sign being experiencing clear thoughts, a clean and bright mind, one consisting of actual healthy and hopeful thoughts, I could formulate my thoughts and recall words again and well. I felt like I was going to be okay.

I developed a fun crush on him, bc he was so attentive, supportive, and a great leader. Before I knew it, it turned out he had a crush on me, and even tried to hit on me once. I was very confused and transparent with him that he is married so that‚Äôs a no go. He apologized and has not tried that at all again. He has, however, continued to try to find opportunities for us to hang out through running together, grabbing a bite, coffee etc. We work in different states so only are in person together on occasion. I‚Äôm a bit puzzled by him. He‚Äôs extremely well-respected at our workplace and everyone knows he‚Äôs married, but he seems to be very ok with being transparent that we have a unique bond. He‚Äôll pick me up coffee when he doesn‚Äôt do that for others. He‚Äôll ask to go on a walk during lunch, etc. I‚Äôm also confused bc he told the waiter recently ‚Äúif this dark haired very beautiful woman walks in, send her my way‚Äù (which the waiter told me about later). He also said to me ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not obvious to you yet, I‚Äôll give you whatever you want.‚Äù But at the same time, he has not tried to be physical with me again and if anything, has mostly initiated activities that almost preclude potential for more physical potential. He‚Äôs also clearly married. I genuinely don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs looking for a hookup from me. 

I guess I‚Äôm puzzled. What‚Äôs the end game here?

Thank you for all the support and advice everyone has given me and my family. I truly appreciate it! 

And now on to the update:

On Friday (Nov.8) Kevin and Karen decided they weren't available to meet, so Aunt, my mom Bee, her sister (my other aunt) Lynn, and Lynn's daughter Alice started calling all the bill companies, insurance companies, and all the different accounts Uncle had before passing. I even called the credit beareau to see if anything supprising was opened under Uncle's name or Aunt's name. Fortunately, nothing was a suprise and all the accounts were accounted for on our end.

Unfortunately, due to unforseen circumstances there is a delay in getting the death certificate and filing his Life Insurance because of people at Uncle's company being on vacation and unable to file the claims and paperwork. So we have to wait a little longer before we are able to schedule his funeral.

On Saturday (Nov.9), I was able to meet Kevin at a public place (with Alice right across the street if I needed her) and told him that I am now in charge of his mother's accounts, Living Trust, living will, and basically everything in her life. He shocked me by being docile the entire time I was talking. He and I were as close as siblings for the first 18 years of our lives, but drifted apart due to me going to college and both of us starting our own lives. I told him that he really messed up here, and I am not going to allow this behavior any more. I also told him that I have no qualms calling Adult Protective Services or the police on him or his sister if their behaviors do not straighten up. 

He surprised me again, by telling me that he needs to change his spending habits and attitude, and is starting to understand that everything he was doing was uncalled for. He even said he understood why he wasn't getting any money. Now, I wasn't born yesterday, so I heard what he was saying and will hope for the best where Kevin is concerned, but plan for the worst. 

Since Karen was not able to be there, I told Kevin to get Karen on the phone and put it on speaker since we were outside a coffee shop. Kevin started to say that I was in charge of their mother's accounts and...

Karen interrupted and started yelling, ""HOW DARE YOU TAKE AWAY MY MONEY FROM ME! THOSE ARE MY ACCOUNTS AND I DESERVE..."" I took Kevin's phone and hung up on her. She tried to call back several times, but I declined all the calles. She finally gave up after about 5 minutes. I told Kevin that it is now up to him to relay the basic information to Karen, and if she wants to call me and speak to me like an adult, to give her my phone number. I knew this was not the end, but it felt good hanging up on her several times.

Now for the latest piece of drama for today (Nov.13). Today the Social Security check went through for my Aunt's account, and for whatever reason, my Uncle's check from October went to his account instead of Aunt's. Before we could go to the bank to see what we needed to do to transfer the funds, someone accessed Uncle's account and tried to withdraw all the funds. Luckily we froze his account with the bank, and we attempted to ask who tried to take money out of his account. The bank said that until they have the death certificate, they can't release any of this information to us.

I called Kevin and hinted that someone tried to hack into Uncle's account and steal money. He sounded genuinely shocked, and even checked his own account to see if anyone tried to also get into his account. I asked him for Karen's number and called her, where I also hinted the same to her. She started the call sounding arrogant, and I started talking about how concerned I was about everything that is happening, and that I am going to tell the bank to call the police so we can file charges. Her voice started to shake when I mentioned getting the police involved ""because the bank said they would release the information to me when a death certificate is provided."" She was like, ""Oh... yeah... you should do that.""

Then I reminded her that stealing from the bank is actually a federal crime, and ""I hope they add on the charges of financial Elder abuse on top of the federal charge."" It took a while for her to answer, but her voice was shaking even more than before. I asked how her husband was getting along in the Navy, and asked after her newborn baby girl, but she suddenly had to hang up the phone.

At this point, I don't think anything she can/is/will do is going to surprise me. But I am looking forward to making that final decision to get the police involved. 

This is most of the updated information I have right now, but I know there will be another update in the near future. And again, I appreciate all the advice given to me because half the time I feel like I'm just guessing at what I need to do next.",77,1731565130.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,11,1.0,False

1gqyldt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1gqyldt/my_3_week_microdose_journey_and_road_to/,My 3 week microdose journey and road to mindfulness & clarity üôèüèΩ,"I recently wrapped up a transformative three-week journey, combining microdosing with a mindful lifestyle shift, that led to some profound realizations about my priorities and habits. I thought I‚Äôd share my experience for anyone interested in microdosing, personal growth, or just looking to create a more intentional approach to their day-to-day life.

Background: My Morning Routine & Microdosing Protocol

For two weeks, I stuck to a routine that included a daily juice to start my morning. My juice blend consisted of celery, beets, carrots, lemon, lime, apple, orange, and ginger‚Äîa nutrient-packed combo that felt like fuel for both body and mind. This morning ritual went hand-in-hand with my microdosing regimen, which was .2g for three days on and one day off.

Every morning looked the same:
	1.	Start with my juice.
	2.	Take my microdose cap.
	3.	Meditate for 15 minutes.
	4.	Journal to plan out my day.
	5.	Hit the gym and sauna.

By sticking to this routine, I lost 10 pounds over those two weeks, but the benefits went far beyond physical changes. I felt clearer, more focused, and grounded in a way that I hadn‚Äôt experienced before.

Transitioning to a Macrodose: A Game-Changing Experience

After the two-week microdosing phase, I spent the third week building up to a macrodose. Two days in, I decided to go for it and took 2.5g. The experience hit hard but in a way that truly opened my eyes. It forced me to pause and reflect on what matters most to me‚Äîboth in my work and personal life.

Insights Gained: Redefining Priorities and Eliminating Distractions

The macrodose helped me realize that I had been spreading my energy thin, focusing on tasks and projects that weren‚Äôt truly meaningful to me. Work is work, and there will always be busy tasks, but I could finally see the difference between work that fulfills me and tasks I was just going through the motions with.

After that session, I made some big changes:
	‚Ä¢	Letting Go of Half-Hearted Projects: If I wasn‚Äôt 100% committed, I let it go. It became clear that anything I was ‚Äúhalf-assing‚Äù was only taking away from the meaningful work I could be doing. My focus and energy now go towards the projects that align with my core goals and values.
	‚Ä¢	Prioritizing Relationships: I realized how much my closest relationships mean to me, and I‚Äôm now investing more time and energy in the people who matter most. Quality over quantity isn‚Äôt just a saying‚Äîit‚Äôs a truth that this journey helped me embrace.
	‚Ä¢	Breaking Away from Old Habits: Certain habits that I used to rely on for comfort or productivity were actually holding me back. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve left behind:
	‚Ä¢	Social Media Scrolling: No more endless IG scrolling.
	‚Ä¢	Background Podcasts: I used to think I needed background noise to feel productive, but now I see it was more distracting than helpful.
	‚Ä¢	Coffee Dependency: I‚Äôd become reliant on morning and midday coffee. Cutting back has helped me find a more natural energy flow.
	‚Ä¢	Mindless Snacking: I‚Äôd snack throughout the day, often out of habit rather than hunger. Now, I‚Äôm focused on letting my body reset and heal, and it‚Äôs amazing how much better I feel.

This journey reminded me that I have the power to make real, intentional choices about how I live my life. By cutting out the noise, I‚Äôm finding more clarity and purpose in my work and personal life. Letting go of distractions has been a liberating experience, and I‚Äôm excited to keep growing in this new direction.

If you‚Äôre considering a similar journey, or even just thinking about changing some habits, I highly recommend exploring what truly adds value to your life and embracing those changes with intention.",0,1731565113.0,Mindfulness,0,0.38,False
1gqykup,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gqykup/grinder_w_excess_chaff_and_rotating_types_of/,Grinder w/ excess chaff and rotating types of beans [$150],"Hello! I have a friend that recently got into roasting and selling coffee beans that vary in! I love supporting them but has noticed a significant amount of chaff that does end up getting ground. 

So I am wondering if there is any tips or tricks I should do to get rid of it. I also saved and got the Bambino and have been upgrading the small/cheaper items, but now am looking at getting a better grinder. 

I‚Äôve seen lots of grinders reading here but was wondering having a grinder that can handle extra chaff in the coffee and that can handle different coffee beans often without much hassle. I‚Äôm upgrading from a $40 Shardor off brand electric burr grinder I got as a wedding gift. 

I know that the Bambino isn‚Äôt the highest quality so I was thinking something that matches the quality (aka unlike a Niche Zero where I would feel like I needed to instantly upgrade) but I may be faulty in my thinking.  

I‚Äôm mostly looking for a grinder that is a good deal and will be keeping an eye out around Black Friday deals. I‚Äôd like to spend around $100 but if there is an insane deal on a top end I‚Äôd pay around $250. 

Thanks for your help here! Let me know if more info would be helpful.
