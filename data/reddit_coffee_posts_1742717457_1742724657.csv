[ALL EVENTS AND CONVERSATIONS HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED]


TYLER [VO]

The road was quaint and inoffensive. Managing to hide in plain sight the reputation it has garnered in the last five years. Built in the 1870s, the road was originally used to transport workers during the Australian Gold Rush. 


[NATURE SOUNDS]


Along the side of the road you can still make out wooden structures that used to provide shelter to the gold miners. Old rotted wood crumbling under its own weight, the trees have grown over them. Keeping the history these buildings held all to themselves. 


This road, only about twelve kilometres long is the crime scene to seven of the most brutal murders to take place in Australia. All of these murders have been unsolved. However, all of the victims were subject to the same amount of visceral and brutal violence. Locals of the road, at least the few left, often keep to themselves, retirees looking to spend their remaining years in solitude. 


[CAR DRIVING OVER DIRT]


Sam

You think anyone is going to talk to us?


TYLER [VO]

That is my co host [REDACTED]. We have been covering the unsolved murders of State Tree Road on our podcast, [REDACTED]. 


TYLER

I don’t think so. 


[ROYALTY FREE SCARY MUSIC PLAYING]


TYLER [VO]

While none of the locals living on State Tree Road wanted to talk to [REDACTED] and I. There was still a small town only about thirteen kilometres south that was more than willing to converse with us. 


[INDISTINCT NOISES]


Sam

So you’re saying it’s a Yowie?


Woman

You bet. My brother seen him. He would take bear traps up there and hide them in the bushes. Trying to catch it. 


Tyler

But the killer used the bear traps, no?


TYLER [VO]

The mention of bear traps was interesting. Four victims were found being forced into bear traps. At least, that’s what forensics concluded. Scuff marks in the mud and multiple scratches on their faces or arms where they fought their attackers attempts to shove their victims into the trap. The traps were also left out in the open. No attempt to be hidden and simply used as a tool. Not as a trap. 


The town was small with a city like bustle hidden within the town the mountains surrounded. A warm and friendly community that welcomed my co-host and I with open arms. A far cry from the cold and isolated State Tree Road that sat just thirteen kilometres north. 


From [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] comes, [REDACTED]. A true crime investigation series hosted by [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]


If you've listened to [REDACTED] before, you probably know that our first episode was about the unsolved murders of Marcus Welsh, Tia Kinney and Phoebe Baker just ten meters off of State Tree Road. Ever since that episode aired, four more people have been murdered on the small stretch of road. With two more going missing in the area along with them. That’s nine possible victims in the last five years. 


[REDACTED] and I were able to sit down with the lead detective on the case, [REDACTED]. He sat across from us, stirring a black coffee. Bitter and colourless, the mans demeanour was a reflection of his coffee order. 


Lead Detective

I think it was about six months into my transferral that the murders of, uh… Marcus Welsh, Phoebe Baker and Tia Kinney took place. 


Tyler

What immediately stood out to you about the scene?



Lead Detective

I remember thinking my partner had taken a wrong turn. We had to drive for about an hour. I’m stationed forty five minutes east of [REDACTED]. So this whole place is a little unfamiliar to me. Not so much anymore. 


[LAUGHS] 


Sam

But with the scene. How the bodies were found. What stood out about that?


Lead Detective

I believed Marcus had done the girls in, actually. It seemed pretty open and shut to me at first. What seemed like a self inflicted head shot wound on Marcus. The two girls were killed pretty brutally. Middle of no where. Who else would be out there? My partner could not find the weapon Marcus used to shoot himself. I mean typically, you drop the gun in your lap when you shoot yourself from a seated position. 


Sam

You didn’t find the weapon? Your partner did?


Lead Detective

I mean, yes. I suppose. I was looking too. For any evidence really. 


Sam

Right. 


Tyler

At what point did you realise there was another person involved outside of the three victims?


Lead Detective

Not finding the weapon used to commit suicide stood out to me as suspicious. We found very large footprints in the mud as well, not matching any of the victims. 


Tyler

It’s said that the investigation into the case only lasted three days before being handed off and eventually forgotten. There hasn’t been any movement of the case since the month it happed. Why is that?


Lead Detective 

It has not been forgotten. Truth be told. The best criminals are impossible to catch. We had nothing to go off. 


Sam

Nothing to go off? How about ballistics on the headshot wound on Marcus or the footprint in the mud?


Lead Detective

It was a standard shotgun shell. Nothing identifiable about it. The footprint was simply a small clue. 


Sam

A small clue to crack the case?


Lead Detective

A small clue to put in some file. 


Tyler

What efforts were made on the initial triple homicide?


Lead Detective

I handed it off when I realised the case did not have enough evidence to pro—


Tyler

So you didn’t interview anyone?


Lead Detective

We interviewed many locals. No one saw or heard anything. Alibis all checked out. 


Sam

So what was—what about the cult located just five kilometres west of the crime scene?


Lead Detective

I said all the alibis checked out. 


Sam

[LAUGHS]


Tyler

Speaking of the cult. What member of the cult did you speak to?


Lead Detective

I think we are using cult a little liberally here, no? I mean it’s four people. Four people that worship a scarecrow. It’s not Waco. It’s not uh, Heavens Gate. It’s four people. 


Sam

Five at the time. Have you researched this cult at all?


Lead Detective

Of course I have. 


Sam

No, I don’t think you did. Its ties to satanic rituals are incredibly deep. It’s practically a branch of satanism. 


Lead Detective

I think the era of Satanic Panic died decades ago, Sam. 


Sam

But is it not worth looking into when three people are brutally murdered and they are one of the few people nearby?


Lead Detective

Of course it’s worth looking into. That’s why we did and we came back with nothing. 


Tyler

It was only four months later that Matt Page went missing after going for a hike on the trails outside of State Tree Road. Did you immediately know there was a connection between the two cases?


Lead Detective

There is still no evidence that makes me confident these cases are linked. 


Sam

He went missing from the same vicinity only four mon-


Lead Detective

Off a hiking trail. He may have went off the trail, gotten lost. There are still mine shafts hidden by the bush out there. He may have fallen down them during a misadventure. 


Sam 

I want to know why the police of [REDACTED] gave up on the triple homicide so quickly. Is there more to the story than you let on?


Lead Detective 

I joined the force to help people. I have solved over two hundred homicides in my career. At the end of the day, Sam. This is a career. I have to make moves that benefit my career. Quite frankly, I find your line of questioning quite hostile and rude. 


Sam

[LAUGHS]


Tyler [VO]

They continued to bicker about small details of the case. His dismissal of the Matt Page disappearance was annoying but expected. Truth is, the only links between the Welsh, Kinney, Baker triple homicide and the Matt Page disappearance was their vicinity. The connection to State Tree Road. The state of the scene of the triple homicide was horrific. Officers and forensics compared it to a bear attack with the carnage and complete ferociousness of the murders. Meanwhile, Matt Page disappeared without a trace. Vanished. There was still however the double homicide that occurred the following year. Involving a father and son duo who were camping on the national camp connected to State Tree Road. Anthony and Shaun Miller were attacked at their campsite. Shaun, fourteen at the time, had his head shoved into a bear trap. While Anthony had been whipped, tied to a tree and kicked so violently in the head, they initially thought he had been shot with a shotgun. This attack occurred only four hundred meters away from where the Welsh Kinney Baker homicides took place. 


Tyler

How about the connection to the murders of Anthony and Shaun Miller? 


Lead Detective

We do believe it is linked. 


Sam

Is it safe to assume there is a serial killer targeting people on State Tree Road?


Lead Detective

I don’t want to confirm or deny anything. What I can say is that it is believed that those cases are linked. However, to cry serial killer may cause a panic in a small community. There may be multiple attackers, there may be a copycat of some kind. These murders occurred a year after one anoth-


Sam

Matt Page went missing there just eight months before the murders of the Millers. 


Lead Detective 

I do not believe these cases are all linked. 


Tyler [VO]

The detective is an imposing figure. Even in his age, he has a certain gravitas. This is combined with a callous stare and a cold demeanour. I could already see my co-host becoming frustrated with the typical vague answers of a detective. 


Tyler

The cult is-


Lead Detective

I promise you the cult is not involved. The cult is a fear mongering tactic used by you radio people to exaggerate the story. Someone killed seven people. This cult, that you speak of, is simply blown out of proportion. They are a-


Sam

The sixth known victim…


[PAGES RUSTLING]


Here. Christian Leone. The sixth known victim was found murdered only two months after the death of the Millers. Christian Leone was a part of this cult. Is that any connection?


Lead Detective

Christian Leone’s death was ruled a suicide. 


Sam

Was it suicide though?


Lead Detective

Christian Leone hung himself. 


Sam

But the rope was tied around a seperate tree?


[SPEECH FADES]


Tyler [VO]

This next part is hard to explain. Christian Leone was found hanging from a noose in the national forest next to State Tree Road. Typically, in a suicide, the victim climbs a tree, ties the rope to a branch and wraps the noose around their neck before jumping. Christians suicide was suspicious as he had not tied himself to the tree he hung himself from. Instead the rope was tied to a seperate tree located behind him and the rope had been thrown over the branch he hung from. Meaning Christian Leone had to have tied the rope to the base of a tree and throw the rope over the top of another tree branch before walking over climbing the tree and putting his head through the noose and then finally jumping off the branch. A little convoluted, no?


Lead Detective

I am not going to try and rationalise the thoughts of a suicidal person. 


Sam

Is it not possible someone else hung him?


Lead Detective

Even if that was the case. Which I will add, it is not. This does not have any connection to the murder of the Millers and the Welsh Kinney Baker Homicides. The entire M.O is completely different. There was nothing to indicate, to us, the same viciousness of those attacks. 


Sam

The tree branch had such intense rope burn it had cut itself into the branch. 


Lead Detective

Christian Leone weighed ninety seven kilos at the time of his death. 


Sam

That’s still not enough to cause that. 


Lead Detective 

How would someone be able to pull him up so quickly he burns through the branch?


Sam

Four other people could probably do it. 


Tyler [VO]

I hadn’t even covered all the cases with [REDACTED] yet. My co-host was intent on calling him out for some lie. I had to ask my co-host to leave the room so I could question the detective about the remaining cases. 


[RUSTLE OF CLOTHES]


[PAPER SHUFFLING]


Lead Detective

I find him quite rude. 


Tyler

He is very passionate. We are just trying to get to the truth of what happened. 


Lead Detective 

Sometimes the truth is impossible to find. 


Tyler

I really don’t believe that. 


[PAPER NOISES]


I just wanted to ask you about, uhhh… three more cases here. We can get this over with quick if you’d like. 


Lead Detective 

Please do. 


[LAUGHS]


Tyler

Two years after Christian Leone committed suicide, James Howard went missing after his car broke down on State Tree Road. 


Lead Detective

Once again, a case of misadventure. 


Tyler

Ok. 


Lead Detective

People go missing in and around national parks all the time. Especially where there are gold mine shafts. That’s just… that’s just his it is. 


Tyler

One year after that, Lucas Dance was found dismembered and displayed on a tree at State Tree Road. 


Lead Detective

I have reason to believe the person responsible for that death is already behind bars. 


Tyler

May I ask who?


Lead Detective

No, sorry. 


Tyler

Finally, only six months ago, and six months after Lucas Dance was found. Sienna Tyson was killed at State Tree Road after being tortured. She was strangled with barbed wi-


Lead Detective

I do remember the details of that case. 


Tyler

My apologies. 


Lead Detective

No need. It’s for the audience for this uh… radio thing right?


Tyler

Well, podcast, yeah. 


Lead Detective 

Once again, I believe the murderer of Sienna Tyson is already behind bars. 


Tyler

Ok. 


Lead Detective

Will that be all?


Tyler

Ah yes, thank you for your time. 


Lead Detective

My pleasure. 


Tyler [VO]

The detective and I said our goodbyes. He didn’t look at my co-host while he left. My co-host carried the same attitude. We returned back to our hotel room and I allowed [REDACTED] to listen to the remainder of the interview. Where he had this to say. 


Sam

What the hell happened to hard hitting journalism?


Tyler 

We might need him for another interview later. I didn’t want any bad blood. 


Sam

He was hiding something. 


Tyler

I don’t know. You were very aggressive. 


Sam

I was asking easy questions. 


Tyler

You were accusing him of being a bad police officer. 


Sam

I never said that. 


Tyler

You implied it. 


Sam

I don’t think I was wrong. 


Tyler [VO]

Little did we know, we were about to crack this case wide open when we finally received a call from someone who lived on State Tree Road. Telling us they had something interesting to show us. [REDACTED] was the only State Tree Road Local who would talk to us. He had set up trail cams to try and catch foxes sneaking into his chicken pen and had a video saved for, the night Sienna Tyson was murdered. 


State Tree Road Local

If you look right here down in the corner. You see it, yeah, aye. Right there. 


Sam

What the fuck is that?


Tyler

That’s a man. 


State Tree Road Local

He sneaking around down there just at the back of the tree line. Those trees are about four meters tall. 


Sam

This guy is half of that. 


Tyler

Did you show this to the police?


State Tree Road Local

I did. Yeah. I thought you guys should see it to though. 


Tyler

He’s got to be like seven feet tall. 


Sam

The detective said he believes the guy responsible for this is already locked up though. 


Tyler

I found the only recent arrest in this area for a violent crime. I believe that’s the guy he was referring to. 


Sam

Can you please send us this?


State Tree Road Local

There’s more. 


[MOUSE CLICKING]


Tyler

Just for the audience right now. He scrolling ahea- oh wait. 


State Tree Road Local

That’s his face there.


Sam

He is dressed as a scarecrow. 


Tyler

Yeah. I don’t think that’s his face. He’s wearing a mask. 


Sam

Have you ever seen anyone that looks like this?


State Tree Road Local

Never in my life. When I saw this the first time. I sat up in my bed all night long with a gun. I was terrified. I truly don’t believe this thing is human. 


Tyler

That's ridiculous. 


Sam

Do you have any more?


State Tree Road Local

No. I check everyday. I showed the police this twice now and they haven’t done nothing with it. 


Sam

We are going to look into this.


Tyler [VO]

I’m sorry if the audio there didn’t quite describe what we saw. We saw a very skinny, very tall man walk out of the tree line dressed in a scarecrow outfit. He observed the chickens before disappearing off camera. He came back a few hours later, presumably after killing Sienna Tyson, and went back into the tree-line. My co-host and I headed back to our hotel room and shared the video to our instagram account at [REDACTED]. 


[INDISTINCT NOISE]


Sam

I mean, it has to be the cult. Worship a scarecrow. A scarecrow attacks them. 


Tyler

Do any of the members match the description? Are they that tall?


Sam

We have to interview them. 


Tyler

I think you’re right.

She replied immediately and we had a great exchange lasting about 4 hours. She said she needed to go to sleep (thank God because I had to wake up super early and it was getting very very late). Next day we chatted at the same time, a bit slower paced since I was really tired but it was a good talk. This one was about 2 hours. I said goodnight this time since again I had to wake up early and the day before I was full on suffering because I slept about 3 hours (I did not reveal this information) still I thought it was worth it.

It was her decision based on a few different issues in the relationship which I fully understand and agree with. I was struggling with my mental health for a long time having come off my anti-depressants. I was incredibly difficult to be around, and kind of went into self-defence mode to protect myself, cutting her out a bit in the process. There were also some sexual issues around not having sex enough and me not being that interested in it at all.

The day we broke up, we agreed (after she asked me not to cut her out of my life completely) that we’d reconnect after 1.5 months or so). I’ve spent that time working on everything she brought up. I had therapy for the sexual issues, I’m back on anti-depressants, I’ve been doing a lot of activities and getting out, and I’ve also taken more of an interest in the people around me and their lives. 

I reached out to her about meeting for a coffee, and she was really nice at work. We had a chat over WhatsApp and I told her I’d moved back to where we live having moved home for a while when I was between jobs. A few days later, I asked her what day would best work for her, and she suddenly became very cold with me and it seems she’s now delaying seeing me. I know this is probably because she’s living a different life and probably having a lot of fun, but it’s brought up a lot of different emotions in me.

Up until now, I definitely still wanted the relationship to work and desperately wanted her back. As time has gone by, I now flip flop between still wanting her back and thinking that maybe this is the best thing for both of us and that it didn’t work anymore. I still love her, but maybe there is something better out there for both of us. I’m very confused, and it’s kinda screwing me up.

1jhvurv,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1jhvurv/how_to_deal_with_energy_vampire/,How to deal with energy vampire?,"I've never done this before, but I'd like to hear from people outside of my limited bubble to know if something is a real problem, or if something is a me problem.

I live in a student accommodation that has a lounge with a free coffee machine. This used to be heaven for me. I'm an art student and most of my classes are online or at unconventional hours, so I'm lucky enough to have free mornings. I've become a morning person and love to start my days drinking as much free coffee as I want while watching old reruns of sitcoms, reading, or sketching.

Naturally, other people use this lounge but few people like sitting there, usually taking their coffee to go. Even people who do sit there or hang out with their friends are no problem to me because I don't really mind the background noise. I'm friendly with a few people and enjoy occasional small talk. My problem is that I'm really easy to draw into conversation. Usually, this is fine and long form conversations can be nice. Lately, it's been really annoying because of one individual. I'll call her Meg.

Meg and I are both women in similar artsy programs. Meg is also someone who I've noticed haunting the lounge every day, the exact same as me. I'd heard her talk to a bunch of people before from across the room, but didn't think much of it. One day, I reached out to make small talk as we were in line to use the coffee machine. She hasn't left me alone since.

After becoming acquaintances (because I wouldn't call us friends), she's been sitting next to me in the lounge. It would be one thing if she just wanted to work in silence next to me, but she frequently interrupts my alone time to talk about herself, her problems, and her life. I swear, I haven't asked a single question about her life but I know her age, background, relationship drama, star sign, etc. She's always working on something, complaining about working, overly negative and pessimistic, and acts like the world is against her.

Other people I've talked to Meg about have described her as an 'energy vampire'. I really don't like this term because I think it's dehumanizing and I feel like it comes with a lot of weird, pseudoscientific baggage. But at the same time, when I looked up what an energy vampire was, she fit the definition exactly.

At first, I tried to give her grace and empathy. After all, we're both students in underappreciated, artsy fields and are both clearly too poor to buy coffee and sit in cafes. I soon realized that she doesn't want to talk to other people so much hear herself talk and make her perspective known. I'm the type of literal, blunt person that I think she really appreciates because I don't really give half-ass platitudes or just smile and nod. If someone tells me about a problem, I can't help but give my honest opinion and advice. This is an example of how I respond to something she'd say:

Meg: I'm never going to finish this project. Even if I do, they're going to hate it because they hate me and nothing I do is good enough.

Me: If they hate it, that's their problem. You're good enough to have gotten this far, so that's worth something. Keep at it. Maybe give yourself a break?

Meg: I can't take a break. I have no money. I need to do this to make money and I hate it. I hate my life. What's the point when AI is just going to take my job?

(The conversation continues for 20-30 minutes)

Whatever I say honestly seems to go in one ear and out the other. I suspect she doesn't hear anything I say and just enjoys hearing herself talk. I've gotten pretty good at putting on my headphones and being able to get back to my own mornings pretty quickly even if she does want to talk or show me something. I think she actually appreciates this because while I can get carried away by discussion, I'm a pretty silent companion who doesn't try to distract people or needs social engagement. I'm at a point where I'm a lot more direct with my advice. I'm even comfortable enough to tell her to stop trying to distract herself and get back to work.

What drives me crazy is that even if I don't engage with her, I have to listen to other people do so! It's very difficult to enjoy my peaceful morning, when I can hear right next to me, people coming up to her and getting sucked into the same trap. It feels like I'm watching them being taken hostage and just sit silently out of politeness while she talks AT them for an hour. So even when I'm not engaging, I'm still feeling drained by the afternoon when it's time for my work day to start.

It feels so hypocritical of me to want more solitude in public. I already feel weird enjoying my mornings, when watching everyone around me constantly on the grind. But I know that if I don't give myself some me time, it'll be really bad for me in the long term. I could always go to my room, but it's a really tiny prison cell with nowhere to sit but my bed. I also get tempted to take naps in my room, so try to avoid it until the evening. Also, the thought of moving from a space that I REALLY enjoy just because of one person annoying is so frustrating!

I just can't tell if I'm in the wrong for feeling this way, or if she's deserving of being called an 'energy vampire'. Part of why I feel so horrible is that I personally know, as someone with autism, that it can be difficult to understand what social behavior is appropriate at any given time. In my heart, I deeply fear that people in my life might think of ME as an 'energy vampire' in the moments when I need to vent or situate myself in conversations.

I genuinely like and care for her.  But I'm feeling hard to make her belive that. I'm a kind of person who'll finish their job and return home. I haven't and don't speak to any female friends or colleagues at my workplace or college unnecessarily. She always brings up this point and tells me if had spoken more to females around me, I would have connected more emotionally to her. I am a social person. I do often hang out with my friends. 

Since every person is unique, how would speaking to other girls make me understand her better. I ask her to give us some more time so that we would understand better.

But grief has a way of waiting for us further down the road. And now, it has caught up to me, and it’s winning.

How do I live without you? You know it feels like we have lived and loved across lifetimes, like we are woven from the same thread. To be apart is to be incomplete. So how do I find my way through the hollow space you left behind? And where precisely do I even go?

Will the ache soften one day? I feel it now, deep in my chest, a physical weight.

This is a defense game where you stop enemies appearing every round.

To get the gear you want, you must follow recipes and assemble each part step by step to quickly create high-tier equipment and clear the stages.

Although crafting each piece of equipment according to its recipe can be tough, the satisfaction and thrill of completing it is what makes this game special.

I’ve always thought this kind of concept was fun, but it was hard to find a game like this on mobile or Steam—so I decided to make it myself.

The gameplay is relatively simple:

1. Defend against enemy lines appearing each round.
2. During downtime, enter the mining zone to gather resources (used for character growth).
3. Combine equipment to upgrade it.
4. Use the crafted gear to survive up to round 60.

It’s available at a low price—about the cost of a cup of coffee.

If you're interested, please add it to your wishlist and follow!

Ever spent hours waiting for a designer to finish your website?

Wasted days going back and forth with content writers?

Paid thousands for tasks that could be automated?

Watch the video tutorial below.

[https://youtu.be/lbacZNJEGuI](https://youtu.be/lbacZNJEGuI)  

I just found something that's going to change everything.

A one-click AI agent that can build websites, write content, publish blog posts, research keywords, and even send emails.

All without an invitation code.

All without software costs.

All for just pennies per task.

I'm talking about RooCode - and it's the most powerful AI agent I've ever tested.

# Why This AI Agent Is Different From Everything Else

Most AI tools are trapped in a box.

They can write content, but they can't publish it.

They can generate code, but they can't deploy it.

They can create emails, but they can't send them.

RooCode breaks free from these limitations because it can actually control your browser.

It doesn't just write blog posts - it logs into WordPress and publishes them.

It doesn't just generate code - it builds and deploys entire websites.

It doesn't just draft emails - it opens Gmail and prepares them for sending.

# How To Get This AI Agent Working In Minutes

The setup is surprisingly simple:

1. Download Visual Studio Code (free at code.visualstudio.com)
2. Install the RooCode extension
3. Connect your Anthropic API key (Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
4. Run Chrome in debug mode
5. Enable the browser tool
6. That's it!

Don't want to pay for Anthropic's API? No problem. You can use Google's free API instead.

The entire setup takes less than 10 minutes, and I provide step-by-step instructions in my AI Profit Boardroom.

# Mind-Blowing Examples Of What This AI Agent Can Do

# Example 1: Building Complete Websites In Minutes

I told RooCode: ""Research Julian Goldie. Then build and deploy the best possible website you can about me.""

The results? It:

* Used Perplexity to research information about me
* Created HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Built a complete website
* Deployed it locally
* All without me touching a single line of code

In another test, I asked it to create a website about the latest AI news headlines. It:

* Opened Google
* Searched for current AI news
* Gathered information from different sources
* Built a complete news website with sources, timestamps, and images
* Did all this while I was working on something else

Think about that. From concept to finished website in minutes, not weeks or months.

# Example 2: Publishing WordPress Content Automatically

When I asked RooCode to write a blog post targeting a specific keyword, it:

* Navigated to my WordPress site
* Logged in
* Created a new post
* Wrote high-quality content
* Added proper formatting, headings, and structure
* Published it

All I had to do was give it a single prompt. The AI agent handled everything else.

# Example 3: Autonomous Keyword Research

I wanted to find some low-competition keywords for a client in Thailand.

I asked RooCode to conduct comprehensive keyword research using HREFS.

Without any prior knowledge of how HREFS works, it:

* Opened the tool
* Figured out how to use it
* Found valuable keywords like ""Phuket SEO agency,"" ""Thailand SEO services,"" and ""Bangkok SEO company""
* Provided a complete report

This is keyword research that would take a VA hours to complete, done in minutes.

# Example 4: Email Outreach Made Simple

I tested RooCode's email capabilities with a simple prompt: ""Go to Gmail and write an email to me@juliangoldie.com. Invite him to an SEO party.""

It opened my browser, navigated to Gmail, and drafted a complete email - faster than I could have typed it myself.

# What Jobs Is This AI Agent Replacing?

Let's be honest about what's happening:

* Website developers? Replaced by AI.
* Content writers? Replaced by AI.
* Social media managers? Replaced by AI.
* SEO specialists? Largely replaced by AI.
* Virtual assistants? Replaced by AI.

The limitation isn't what AI agents can do anymore. It's that most people don't understand how powerful they already are.

And unlike other AI agents:

* No invitation code required (unlike Manus)
* No daily usage limits
* No virtual environment restrictions
* Works with your actual browser and accounts
* Costs pennies compared to hiring people

# The Shocking Cost Comparison

Every example I showed you in this article - building multiple websites, writing and publishing blog posts, conducting keyword research, and drafting emails - cost me a total of $0.65.

That's less than a cup of coffee.

How much would you pay developers, writers, and virtual assistants to do the same work? Thousands? Tens of thousands?

And RooCode doesn't take weekends off, doesn't need benefits, and doesn't call in sick.

# Frequently Asked Questions About RooCode

# Is RooCode really free?

The extension itself is free. You only pay for API costs, which are pennies per task. And if you use Google's API, you can get started completely free.

# Is it better than Manus?

In many ways, yes. There's no waiting for an invitation code, no daily usage limits, and it can interact directly with your browser and accounts.

# Do I need coding skills?

Not at all. The whole point is that the AI agent handles the technical aspects for you. You just tell it what you want in plain English.

# Can RooCode handle complex tasks?

Yes! I've tested it with everything from simple email drafting to building entire websites and conducting detailed keyword research. It can handle surprisingly complex tasks.

# How much time can it save me?

Based on my testing, RooCode can save you hundreds of hours per month by automating tasks that would normally require a team of specialists.

# How is quality control handled?

You still need to review the AI's output, but I've found it to be extremely high quality. For more critical tasks, I recommend a quick human review before finalizing.

The future isn't AI replacing humans completely - it's entrepreneurs who use AI replacing those who don't.

And RooCode is one of the most powerful AI tools available right now.

Are you going to be left behind?

Ever spent hours waiting for a designer to finish your website?

Wasted days going back and forth with content writers?

Paid thousands for tasks that could be automated?

Watch the video tutorial below.

[https://youtu.be/lbacZNJEGuI](https://youtu.be/lbacZNJEGuI)  

I just found something that's going to change everything.

A one-click AI agent that can build websites, write content, publish blog posts, research keywords, and even send emails.

All without an invitation code.

All without software costs.

All for just pennies per task.

I'm talking about RooCode - and it's the most powerful AI agent I've ever tested.

# Why This AI Agent Is Different From Everything Else

Most AI tools are trapped in a box.

They can write content, but they can't publish it.

They can generate code, but they can't deploy it.

They can create emails, but they can't send them.

RooCode breaks free from these limitations because it can actually control your browser.

It doesn't just write blog posts - it logs into WordPress and publishes them.

It doesn't just generate code - it builds and deploys entire websites.

It doesn't just draft emails - it opens Gmail and prepares them for sending.

# How To Get This AI Agent Working In Minutes

The setup is surprisingly simple:

1. Download Visual Studio Code (free at code.visualstudio.com)
2. Install the RooCode extension
3. Connect your Anthropic API key (Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
4. Run Chrome in debug mode
5. Enable the browser tool
6. That's it!

Don't want to pay for Anthropic's API? No problem. You can use Google's free API instead.

The entire setup takes less than 10 minutes, and I provide step-by-step instructions in my AI Profit Boardroom.

# Mind-Blowing Examples Of What This AI Agent Can Do

# Example 1: Building Complete Websites In Minutes

I told RooCode: ""Research Julian Goldie. Then build and deploy the best possible website you can about me.""

The results? It:

* Used Perplexity to research information about me
* Created HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Built a complete website
* Deployed it locally
* All without me touching a single line of code

In another test, I asked it to create a website about the latest AI news headlines. It:

* Opened Google
* Searched for current AI news
* Gathered information from different sources
* Built a complete news website with sources, timestamps, and images
* Did all this while I was working on something else

Think about that. From concept to finished website in minutes, not weeks or months.

# Example 2: Publishing WordPress Content Automatically

When I asked RooCode to write a blog post targeting a specific keyword, it:

* Navigated to my WordPress site
* Logged in
* Created a new post
* Wrote high-quality content
* Added proper formatting, headings, and structure
* Published it

All I had to do was give it a single prompt. The AI agent handled everything else.

# Example 3: Autonomous Keyword Research

I wanted to find some low-competition keywords for a client in Thailand.

I asked RooCode to conduct comprehensive keyword research using HREFS.

Without any prior knowledge of how HREFS works, it:

* Opened the tool
* Figured out how to use it
* Found valuable keywords like ""Phuket SEO agency,"" ""Thailand SEO services,"" and ""Bangkok SEO company""
* Provided a complete report

This is keyword research that would take a VA hours to complete, done in minutes.

# Example 4: Email Outreach Made Simple

I tested RooCode's email capabilities with a simple prompt: ""Go to Gmail and write an email to me@juliangoldie.com. Invite him to an SEO party.""

It opened my browser, navigated to Gmail, and drafted a complete email - faster than I could have typed it myself.

1jhva3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1jhva3h/finally_losing_weight/,Finally losing weight.,"After 26 years and trying EVERYTHING I finally went on a Candida cleanse diet (yes I know it's a new age quack thing before anyone jumps down my throat, Im not saying yeast overgrowth is the cause of all illness etc. I'd tried everything else including all the medications, Keto and every other diet you can think of.)


Anyway something about this particular diet has, for the first time ever in my life, enabled me to lose weight. I've lost 17 lbs in 12 weeks.  My sleep cycle and my periods have both normalised too. No change yet to hair growth or hirsutism. 

It's essentially a very low sugar diet that avoids processed food. There's no carb avoiding (provided they're whole grain carbs)  or calorie counting. I havnt felt hungry at all  

Anyway if it helps anyone else here I'd be delighted.  The first month was very strict and a bit boring but the last 2 months have been a lot easier. 

This is the txt from the printout I was given


"" To get rid of Candida there are several things you need to do:- One of these is to avoid the following foods for one month and in some cases two months.

Yeast Substances:- Yeast bread, alcohol, beetroot, mushrooms, marmite, yeast extract, soy sauce, mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, miso, pickles, sauerkraut, sourdough bread Fruit and vegetables should be fresh or peeled. Nuts can be eaten only if freshly cracked or toasted. Try to avoid 'yeasty' atmospheres such as damp mouldy places, Stay away from pot plants, which are mouldy. Get at least half an hour of fresh air each day -preferably when the atmosphere is not damp. Wherever possible use olive oil and garlic, they create conditions which are hostile to Candida.

Sugar / Sweet Food:- Sugar, honey, syrup, fruit concentrate or juice, dried fruit, artificial sweeteners and chocolates or sweets. Anything that tastes sweet.

Refined Carbohydrates: The only bread you can eat is CANDIDA bread (recipe is over the page). No Ryvita, biscuits, cake, ordinary breakfast cereal.

Most processed food contains refined carbohydrates.

Dairy Products: Any cow milk, butter, any cheese, dairy margarine, cream, yoghurt,

ice-cream.

Salt: Any type of salt, ham, rashers and bacon.

The only fruit allowed is one apple or one pear or two kiwis a day no other, i.e.. bananas, melons, grapes, etc.

Tea and coffee is out, but most people tolerate decaffeinated tea or coffee without problems. Rooibos, Red Bush or herbal teas, which are not fruit based (such as blackcurrant) are fine. Still water is fine but not carbonated/sparkling/fizzy or fruit flavoured.

Other foods to avoid are hot spices, smoked fish. Where possible obtain free-range eggs and meat, which are free from antibiotics, hormones or steroids.

Do not get depressed! There are many things you can eat which we will discuss. In addition to the things we will cover, here are some further recipe ideas."" 

After a month I could re introduce salt, dairy, vinegar,  potatoes and some other stuff but only one every 3 days. Now I can cheat with ""normal"" foods (including sugar) on weekends. Weight loss has remained consistent.

Usually for a tattoo you should eat and drink plenty before going, as it's quite hard on the body. Also it's best to have plenty of sleep before.

I didn't do that. After a late night at a party, I woke up on 4 hours of sleep and could get back to bed. Because I'm on a diet, I only had a light breakfast and made my way to the tattoo parlor. SO I started the day pretty low on energy.

Sitting waiting for the artist to set up, I realized that I was feeling quite tired, but only in a sleepy way rather than an exhausted way, so I figured I'd be fine just lying on my side for a few hours while the tattoo got done.

A few hours later, having not finished the entire piece, I left the parlor in pretty good shape. Wandered around the city waiting to catch my train back home, visited a pharmacy, grabbed a coffee. But as I waited in the train station an hour later, I started to feel light headed, and rested against a wall for a few minutes. As the time to go the platform approached I got up, started walking and promptly fainted. I woke up in a pool of blood with my head dashed against the tiles of the station, surrounded by onlookers and a few helpful people.

They called the ambulance, I went to the nearest emergency room, and after 13 stitches in my eyebrows I'm left with a hell of a scar and a headache. I'm lucky I didn't get a concussion. I got home about 5 hours after finishing my tattoo, with pain in places I expected and some I didn't. Now I need to get the stitches taken out, and I'll complete the tattoo in few weeks.

# ​Philips‌ Smart Plug (2025): Top Alternatives​ & expert review - Is It Still Worth ‌Buying?

Are you considering⁣ adding a Philips smart plug to ⁤your smart home⁣ setup? Or perhaps you already own one and are wondering⁣ if it's‍ time for an upgrade? ⁤In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into‌ the world of ⁤Philips smart plugs, ⁤exploring their features, compatibility, and value in‍ 2025. ‌We'll also‌ explore the ⁤best Philips smart⁢ plug alternatives on the market, helping you ‍make the most informed decision ⁣for⁢ your smart home needs.

Whether you're a long-time Philips⁤ Hue user, ‌a seasoned smart home enthusiast, or just dipping your toes into the world of home automation, we’ve got you covered. We'll consider factors like price, energy monitoring capabilities, and ease of ​setup to determine if the Philips smart ​plug remains a worthwhile investment.

[[Explore Top Rated philips smart plug on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=philips smart plug)
## Understanding the ‍Philips ​Smart Plug Ecosystem

For many, the appeal of the Philips smart plug lies ⁤in its seamless integration with the broader Philips Hue smart home⁣ ecosystem. If ⁣you are already a Philips ⁣hue user and invested in hue smart home, adding a Philips smart plug can extend your lighting control beyond ‌just your smart bulbs. The ​Philips Hue ⁢ecosystem is known for its reliability and extensive features, and the smart plug‌ slots neatly into ⁤this framework [3,4].

However, the ⁢inherent value of the Philips smart‌ plug goes​ beyond just lighting. it offers a convenient way to remotely control appliances, making it an ideal addition for ‍anyone looking to easily automate devices [4].As an example, you can control a standard ⁢table lamp, a fan, or even a coffee maker with just a few taps on your ‍smartphone or a voice command. Using a smart plug with philips hue integration​ is a really popular option.

[[Explore Top Rated philips smart plug on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=philips smart plug)
## What ⁤to Consider Before ⁢Buying a Philips Smart‌ Plug

Before you rush ⁢out to ​buy philips smart plug, let's consider some​ key factors to⁢ determine if it’s the ⁣right choice for your needs:

*  ⁢ **Compatibility:** The Philips smart plug requires the⁢ Philips Hue Bridge for ⁢full functionality (at ‍least for enhanced features). If you don't already ‍own a Hue Bridge, you'll need to factor in this additional cost.​ Newer versions may‌ offer Bluetooth connectivity, but pairing with the bridge⁤ unlocks the full range of features, including remote access ⁢and‍ advanced automation. Consider a smart plug compatible ​with philips hue if you're after comprehensive ‌capabilities.

*  ⁣ **Price:** The Philips smart plug‍ price can be ⁤a critically important factor for price-sensitive shoppers. It often comes at a premium ⁢compared ⁤to other smart plugs on the market.If budget is‌ a primary concern, you'll ​want⁣ to ​explore Philips ⁢smart plug⁤ alternatives. You‍ may​ even search for philips smart plug deals or hunt for a philips smart plug discount from various online stores or⁢ local retailers.

*  ⁣ **Wattage:** The ​wattage ‍rating of the Philips smart plug is crucial. Ensure it can handle the power demands of the appliances you intend to control. Overloading the plug can lead to ​safety hazards and device⁤ malfunction. Checking the philips smart plug wattage ⁤before buying ​is vital.

*   ⁢**Features:** While ‍simple on/off control is standard, some users may want to use ⁤philips smart ⁤plug and energy monitoring​ features. While traditionally, the Philips Hue smart plug's focus isn't primarily ​energy monitoring, some users desire⁣ these features, which are more commonly found⁤ in other brands.

*  ​ **Reliability:** Philips Hue generally enjoys ⁤a strong⁣ reputation with the Philips smart plugs being an extremely reliable‍ tool [5]. Though, reading recent⁣ Philips smart plug review can definitely help. Some users may ⁢voice concerns. Always research the ⁣latest ⁢models.

[[Explore Top Rated philips smart plug on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=philips smart plug)
## ‌Setting up Your Philips Smart‌ Plug

Philips smart plug ‍setup is designed to be straightforward, especially‌ for existing Hue users. The process typically involves:

1.  **plug‌ it in:** Plug the ‌Philips Smart Plug into a standard electrical outlet.2.  **Connect to the Hue Bridge:** Open the Philips Hue app and follow the instructions to connect the plug to your Hue Bridge. ⁢the app will guide you ‍through the process of adding the new device to your Zigbee network.
3.  **Name⁢ and control:**‌ Once connected, give your‍ smart⁢ plug a ‌descriptive name (e.g., ""Living Room Lamp"") ​and start controlling ⁢it using ​the​ hue app.

I wake up, I get coffee, I log into my computer and do my job, I get off work and walk my dogs, then I play some games to disconnect from my shitty reality.

Love life? Yeah right. I put myself out there but I never have any luck. I wish I had the presence and companionship of a good woman in my life. 

I’m fairly certain that no one likes me and just won’t say it. Ask me if I’m okay and I’ll always lie and say that I am or crack some joke as a defense mechanism to change the topic.

So much good and rare stuff tasted, so many new roasters discovered. Fruity bombs were obviously dominant which is great.

So, I have picked up:

Strawberry Land from one and only DAK (my first ever Bolivian Natural with super interesting acidity). They had Blueberry Boom there too but it was the crowd's favourite and someone snagged the last bag right in front of me. BUT, the friendly fellow sneaked a little taster for me along with the purchase and I'm forever grateful.

Honduras Bomba de Fruta from the local Original Coffee. It is what is says on the tin. A fruit bomb. 

Kenyan Natural from Three Marks (Barcelona) - they had a few top shelve beans there too but I couldn't shell out that much. Kenyan was also great.

A surprising little bag of anaerobic Columbian (La Parada) from a small two-brother owned roastery from Poland. Super charismatic and funny fellows who were really distinctively passionate about their little venture. 

Super looking forward to trying all of them and will definitely attend future events.

1jhv0dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/1jhv0dp/notes_for_prospective_migrants/,Notes for prospective migrants,"Hey guys 👋🏻 I'm officially a student here in Shanghai for the last two months and thought I'd share some tips that would've helped me.

1. Get Alipay, your VPN and WeChat before coming to china. I had to get a VPN once I was here because I'm an idiot and it was a hassle.

2. The metro is the best way to get around, don't waste money on Didi. If you really need to get somewhere specific then sure but the metro has let me organically explore which led to a lot of neat discoveries.

3. Get used to people looking at you. Ya, it's Shanghai and most people are used to it but you're still going to get stares from Chinese tourists and some older locals. You're going to be told by local friends not to worry about it and they're right, nobody is going to harm you BUT sometimes those stares aren't just good willed ""curiousity"". If you really don't like it stare back or wave, they'll either wave or look away.

4. Please try the local food. I immediately went looking for burgers and fries when I arrived but upon trying the local food I have fallen in love with dishes I never thought I'd enjoy. Seriously, the food is incredible here

5. Don't drink Starbucks unless you wanna sit down. Luckin coffee and Manner are cheaper and taste the same, luckin is definitely slightly worse but honestly they're all mediocre.

6. The culture is very different and you're going to have to adapt to them. It's not like some European countries or America where different cultures kinda mesh into their own thing. It's mostly homogenous and as such you'll have to play by their rules (this applies to basically anything in china)

7. Network. Seriously join WeChat groups, go to events with expats and communicate with them. People who have been living here for awhile are a great resource and you might make a few buddies! Also helps you out since most locals don't know the rules themselves and following their advice sometimes isn't the best.

8. Don't go on dates where the local decides where to go, especially if it's Nanjing road, seriously, don't. There's lots of open minded Chinese people here (I was dating my gf before I came here so I never experienced it first hand) but I've heard horror stories. If you do get a huge bill after drinking some tea just threaten to call the police or actually do it and they'll leave you alone.

9. Get used to being a very small fish. I'm from a very small city compared to Shanghai and I had to get used to rushing for seats on the metro, having to just walk through groups of people and dealing with the lack of manners. It's just the reality of any big city is assume.

10. Watch out for the fucking scooters. These things suck and a good chunk of riders don't follow the rules. You will have people zipping on sidewalks, you will have to dodge them, and ya, everyone I've talked to hates it.

11. If you're going to live here understand where you are. Shanghai is very westernised but there's obvious differences and you should keep them in mind, don't be an idiot.

12. Go to the propaganda museum and the first site of the CPC. Really cool areas.

13. Don't end up just walking around malls, happened to me for the first month. Try and get out and about away from them and walk along the streets, you'll find cool stuff.

14. Don't obnoxiously film people dancing in parks. You can take pictures and a video but I've seen too many expats and tourists videoing people trying to have fun on their Friday night, don't be that guy.

And that's it! If this is horribly redundant let me know, just thought I'd chuck it out there.",4,1742720065.0,shanghai,6,0.67,False

The robusta definitely adds some punch, for sure less smooth than a 100% Arabica, but the bold flavors are interesting. Has anyone else tried this?

I’m new to pour-over brewing. My usual methods have been espresso, French press, and overnight cold brew. From what I understand, for medium roasts, the first pour should be at a lower temperature (around 80–85°C), with the rest of the pours between 90–95°C. Does that match your experience?

Reconnected with an old high school friend. I think he asked me on a coffee date. Worried I might be pushing the idea of a potential relationship. I might make things awkward.

Hello, I’m 21f, have never been in a relationship. It wasn’t something I was too interested in growing up, (because my crushes were few and far in-between). However recently, I’ve become interested in the idea of being in a relationship. I’m no stranger to letting someone know I’m interested in them, and I’ve talked with a few people, have gone on a date or two, but they weren’t what I was looking for. 

Then I started thinking about a close friend from high school. We were good friends at the time and great chemistry. He told me that he liked me some at point, but I didn’t reciprocate the feeling—so we just continued to hang out and have fun. I did like spending time with him though because we got along well. 

Me and him stopped talking about 2 years ago (almost 3) Not for any particular reason, just that life got in the way. I sat down though and thought about the reason why I rejected him in the first place—and it was more about me being an insecure high schooler at the time than anything else. I had such a poor perception of myself, and I rejected the idea that anyone could like me like that. But after growing into myself a bit, that hasn’t been as much of the case anymore.

Anyway, I decided to text him sort of on a whim, because I noticed he’s been watching my ig stories. The conversation went really well, just like how we used to talk. But here’s the problem is, I went into this interaction with the idea of a relationship in mind. Not that I was trying to override reconnecting with him, but I also wasn’t holding back on flirting with him a bit. But he seemed receptive to it. I think.

We ended our conversation for the night, and I got a text from him the next morning, asking if I wanted to catch up over coffee. I said yes; but I’m just worried that I might end up pushing this idea of a potential boyfriend in my mind, and I won’t see him as a friend reconnecting first. Well geez, now that I type this out, my perspective doesn’t make much sense to me now either.

An illness struck a family member, complications in a relationship ending in a break up and a friend paying away happened all within 2 weeks of one another.

Pretty much down in the dumps for the past 4-5 months. I then reached out to an old friend of mine from a retail job we used to work at together. Asked to hang out and boom.

Come Saturday and I get ready, pick my clothes up, and get mentally ready to pick her up. I arrive and I see her walking towards me. Forgot how gorgeous she was. She got in and we hit it off, catching up and all that good stuff.

Get to the restaurant and have a drink. Atmosphere is great, conversation isn’t half baked and great times all around. We finish there and head to a rooftop bar. She spots this time and we just keep enjoying the sights and music.

After a bit of walking around we have an espresso and can hear each other better since it was a much more quiet setting. Got to find out some things that I never expected of her but it didn’t phase me in any bit.

To be honest, I was a bit hypnotized by her holding her cup high and smiling. I could feel my heart racing a bit. Not sure if it was the espresso (first time I drink coffee of any sort in years) or just that attraction I felt towards her at that moment.

Finally, we stop at a bar and decided to dance. I felt totally embarrassed because I am a total stiff when it comes to dancing. She just smiled and giggled about the way I felt and made sure that there is no shame here. I built the courage up to pull her closer and hold her. Haven’t felt this great with anyone in a hot minute so I cherished the moment.

Couldn’t help but blush a bit when she looked towards me and I held her. I didn’t want to misconstrue anything so I decided to just play it cool and dance the night away with her. She was tapped out and we decided to call it a night.

For once, after all the stuff I’ve been through, I can finally say that I felt happy that I got to go somewhere new and hang with a friend. The dance was the definite highlight of the evening.

31/f

I was pretty late to the game of LISA and have set up one with HL today investing in HSBC FTSE All World Index. Direct debit to negate and will look into transfer to ETF (probably FWRG again) in a good number of years to cap the 0.25% charge and reduce fees on deals/trades.

I am now in a position where I have this account and my 212 holding FWRG in a stocks and shares ISA- Invest when it exceeds ISA limit. I auto invest daily atm to DCA in the dip, after lump summing in the rise, and it is going very well. However, I am not sure if i should diversify my portfolio now, or continue as I am as I have to option to transfer FRWG shares to HL if that was every favourable in the future and/or I because contribute more than £333 a month to FRWG via 212 (cap for LISA), so should I just keep building in 212?

Note: I do have a pie made up of around 12 single stocks/BH/JPM/ETFs (defence/German market) which i contribute a set amount each week as a bit of fun- in no way am I a day trader or think I can time or beat the market.

More about me: I have an NHS pension which I pay additional contributions to, so the LISA is more for a house in 5-6 years with my partner (they are moving from USA to here so have some time). We are dragging our feet with the move for a few years as USA pays six figures for her job and a third of that here in the UK, so we want to set ourself up to be in a good position first. Yes, I could move to the USA and earn quadruple what I earn here but it'll cost me £35 grand to do that and a good number of years of re-training as exams so overall loss sitting at around £120,000, or I would need to change careers and work my way up from a low skilled job on a marriage visa, which I would be inclined to do with more money in the pot (ski bum hehe). Short-term, long-distance for maximum finance advantage is something we are both happy with. We both want to pay a higher deposit to reduce the mortgage as we will be investing in property on both sides of the pond over the next 20 years as well as our respective Stocks/shares holdings. I have been told to pay the least deposit you can for a house my people in the business, but I really do not like the idea of a 20 year mortgage as I am hoping to reduce hours/only work private by 45. We are definitely not people who work to save money, we work to live too- we travel all over the world to amazing places but bootleg where we can (just got back from Sri Lanka and the Maldives), see eachother every 8-10 weeks, ski, surf, yoga retreats, and both spend higher than average on high welfare/organic/non-UPF food shops etc. I put this info is in, just incase anyone has any thoughts on this too- be as brutal as you like....

Any thoughts- sorry if it is rambly haven't had my morning coffee yet!

**Creative Ways Businesses Handle Special Requests Without Breaking Company Rules**

In today’s competitive marketplace, businesses are increasingly expected to go above and beyond to meet customer expectations. While standardized policies and procedures ensure consistency and efficiency, they can sometimes fall short when it comes to addressing unique or unexpected requests from customers. Striking a balance between maintaining company rules and delivering exceptional service is a delicate art—but one that successful businesses have mastered through creativity, flexibility, and strategic thinking.

This article explores innovative approaches businesses use to handle special requests without compromising their core principles. From leveraging technology to fostering employee empowerment, these strategies demonstrate how companies can turn challenges into opportunities while staying compliant with internal guidelines.

# 1. Understanding the Importance of Handling Special Requests

Before diving into specific solutions, it’s important to understand why accommodating special requests matters:

* **Customer Loyalty:** Going the extra mile for a customer fosters trust and loyalty, increasing the likelihood of repeat business.
* **Brand Reputation:** Positive word-of-mouth generated by satisfied customers enhances a brand's image.
* **Competitive Edge:** In industries where products and services may be similar, personalized attention sets businesses apart.
* **Problem-Solving Culture:** Encouraging creative problem-solving builds resilience and adaptability within teams.

However, granting every request indiscriminately could lead to operational inefficiencies, inconsistency, or even violations of company policies. Therefore, businesses must find ways to accommodate reasonable requests creatively while adhering to established rules.

# 2. Empower Employees Through Training and Guidelines

One of the most effective ways businesses manage special requests is by empowering employees with the tools and authority to make decisions. This requires robust training programs and clear frameworks that guide staff on handling exceptions responsibly.

# a) Role-Specific Training

Training should equip employees with knowledge about company policies, potential workarounds, and communication techniques. For instance:

* Frontline staff might learn how to negotiate timelines or suggest alternative products.
* Managers might receive advanced training on resolving complex issues involving multiple stakeholders.

# b) Establish Clear Boundaries

While encouraging autonomy, businesses must define limits to prevent overstepping. For example:

* A hotel concierge might be authorized to upgrade rooms but not offer free stays.
* Retail associates might provide small discounts (e.g., 5%) without managerial approval.

# c) Use Scripted Responses Wisely

Scripts help maintain professionalism while allowing room for personalization. For example, instead of saying ""We can't do that,"" an associate might say, ""Here’s what we *can* do to assist you.""

# 3. Leverage Technology for Customization

Technology plays a pivotal role in enabling businesses to fulfill special requests efficiently and creatively. Here’s how:

# a) Personalized Recommendations Using AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms analyze customer data to predict preferences and recommend tailored solutions. For example:

* Streaming platforms like Netflix suggest content based on viewing history.
* E-commerce sites like Amazon highlight products aligned with past purchases.

By anticipating needs, businesses can preemptively address requests before they arise.

# b) Dynamic Pricing Models

Dynamic pricing allows businesses to adjust costs based on demand, time, or customer behavior. Airlines, ride-sharing apps, and hotels often use this strategy to accommodate last-minute bookings or upgrades without breaking standard pricing structures.

# c) Real-Time Communication Tools

Chatbots and live chat systems enable instant responses to inquiries. These tools can escalate unusual requests to human agents if needed, ensuring timely resolution.

# d) Digital Self-Service Options

Allowing customers to customize orders online gives them control over their experience. For example:

* Fast-food chains let patrons modify ingredients via mobile apps.
* Clothing retailers offer virtual try-ons or custom sizing options.

# 4. Offer Alternatives Instead of Exceptions

Sometimes, granting a direct request isn’t feasible—but offering alternatives can still satisfy the customer. Creative substitutions require resourcefulness and a deep understanding of available options.

# a) Substitute Products or Services

If a requested item is unavailable, suggest comparable alternatives. For instance:

* A restaurant might substitute an out-of-stock ingredient with a similar one.
* A bookstore might recommend another title by the same author.

# b) Flexible Timing

For requests involving timing constraints, propose alternative schedules. Examples include:

* Allowing early check-in or late checkout at hotels for an additional fee.
* Offering expedited shipping for urgent orders.

# c) Bundled Offers

Instead of fulfilling a single request, bundle related items or services. For example:

* A spa might combine treatments to create a custom package.
* A tech store might pair accessories with devices for added value.

# 5. Create Policies That Allow Room for Flexibility

Some businesses design their policies with built-in flexibility to accommodate special requests seamlessly. This proactive approach minimizes friction during execution.

# a) Tiered Membership Programs

Loyalty programs reward frequent customers with perks that can be used to fulfill special requests. For example:

* Airlines allow elite members to access priority boarding or complimentary upgrades.
* Coffee shops give free drinks after a certain number of purchases.

# b) Seasonal Promotions

Limited-time offers provide opportunities to grant requests under specific conditions. For instance:

* Retailers might waive return fees during holiday seasons.
* Hotels might offer discounted rates for extended stays during low-demand periods.

# c) Exception Clauses

Including clauses in contracts or terms of service that outline acceptable exceptions ensures transparency. For example:

* Event venues might permit decor changes as long as no damage occurs.
* Software providers might extend trial periods for enterprise clients.

# 6. Foster Collaboration Across Departments

Handling special requests often involves coordination across different departments. By fostering interdepartmental collaboration, businesses can deliver seamless experiences.

# a) Cross-Functional Teams

Forming teams comprising representatives from various departments enables holistic problem-solving. For example:

* A marketing team might collaborate with production to launch a limited-edition product.
* IT and customer support might work together to resolve technical issues quickly.

# b) Shared Databases

Centralized databases allow all departments to access real-time information about customer interactions. This prevents duplication of efforts and ensures consistent messaging.

# c) Escalation Protocols

Clear protocols for escalating complex cases ensure accountability. For example:

* If frontline staff cannot resolve a request, they escalate it to supervisors or specialized teams.

# 7. Build Partnerships for Extended Capabilities

When internal resources are insufficient, partnering with external entities expands possibilities. Strategic alliances enable businesses to fulfill requests that would otherwise exceed their capabilities.

# a) Third-Party Vendors

Collaborating with suppliers or vendors can unlock new options. For example:

* Restaurants partner with local farms for fresh produce.
* Travel agencies collaborate with tour operators for exclusive packages.

# b) Community Engagement

Engaging community organizations or volunteers can enhance offerings. For example:

* Nonprofits host events with corporate sponsors to raise funds.
* Gyms partner with fitness influencers for workshops.

# c) Affiliate Networks

Affiliate marketing connects businesses with complementary services. For example:

* An airline partners with car rental companies for bundled travel deals.
* A fashion retailer collaborates with accessory brands for co-branded promotions.

# 8. Communicate Transparently with Customers

Transparency is key to managing expectations and building trust. When businesses communicate openly about limitations and alternatives, customers are more likely to appreciate their efforts.

# a) Explain Constraints Clearly

Honest explanations about why a request cannot be fulfilled help reduce frustration. For example:

* “We apologize, but due to safety regulations, we cannot alter this feature.”
* “Unfortunately, our supplier has delayed delivery, but we’re working to expedite it.”

# b) Set Realistic Timelines

Providing accurate timelines helps manage anticipation. For example:

* “Your customized order will take three weeks to process.”
* “Our team will respond within 24 hours.”

# c) Follow Up Consistently

Regular updates reassure customers that their concerns are being addressed. For example:

* Sending confirmation emails after each interaction.
* Providing progress reports for ongoing requests, such as order tracking or service fulfillment.

# d) Offer Apologies and Compensation When Appropriate

When a request cannot be fully accommodated, sincere apologies paired with small gestures of goodwill can leave a positive impression. For instance:

* Offering a discount on future purchases.
* Providing complimentary services or products as a token of appreciation for the customer’s understanding.

Transparent communication not only builds trust but also demonstrates professionalism and accountability, which are essential for maintaining long-term relationships.

# 9. Encourage Feedback to Improve Processes

Businesses that actively seek feedback from customers regarding special requests gain valuable insights into areas for improvement. This proactive approach helps refine policies and procedures to better accommodate future requests.

# a) Post-Interaction Surveys

After resolving a special request, businesses can send surveys asking customers about their satisfaction levels and suggestions for improvement. For example:

* “How satisfied were you with how we handled your request?”
* “What could we have done differently to enhance your experience?”

# b) Focus Groups and Interviews

Engaging customers in focus groups or one-on-one interviews allows businesses to delve deeper into specific challenges and opportunities related to special requests. These discussions often yield actionable ideas that can be implemented across the organization.

# c) Analyze Trends

By analyzing patterns in customer feedback, businesses can identify recurring issues and develop standardized solutions for common requests. For example:

* If multiple customers request extended return windows, consider revising return policies accordingly. – If there’s frequent demand for a particular customization, explore making it a permanent offering.

Feedback loops ensure that businesses remain responsive to evolving customer needs while continuously refining their processes.

# 10. Personalize Experiences Through Data Insights

Modern businesses leverage data analytics to anticipate and address special requests before customers even articulate them. By analyzing past behaviors and preferences, companies can tailor experiences to individual customers’ unique requirements.

# a) Predictive Analytics

Predictive models use historical data to forecast what a customer might need next. For example:

* A subscription box service might recommend adding a new item based on previous selections.
* A travel agency might suggest destinations similar to those visited in the past.

# b) Customer Segmentation

Segmenting customers into categories based in demographics, purchase history, or behavior enables targeted responses to special requests. For example:

* High-value customers might receive exclusive offers or priority handling.
* First-time buyers might benefit from introductory discounts or personalized guidance.

# c) Real-Time Personalization

Real-time systems adjust offerings dynamically based on current interactions. For example:

* An online retailer might display complementary items as a customer adds products to their cart.
* A streaming platform might suggest pausing a movie if it detects the viewer has been inactive for an extended period.

Personalization powered by data ensures that special requests feel less like exceptions and more like natural extensions of the customer journey.

# 11. Empower Customers with Self-Service Options

Sometimes, empowering customers to resolve their own requests is the most efficient way to meet their needs without breaking company rules. Self-service options give customers autonomy while reducing strain on internal resources.

# a) Interactive FAQs

A robust FAQ section addresses common questions and provides step-by-step instructions for resolving typical issues. For example:

* How to modify an order online.
* Steps to request a refund or exchange.

# b) Customizable Online Portals

Allowing customers to manage accounts, update preferences, or track orders through secure portals gives them control over their experience. For example:

* Banks let users set spending limits or freeze cards via mobile apps.
* Airlines enable passengers to select seats, check in, and manage luggage preferences online.

# c) Virtual Assistants

AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants provide instant answers to queries and guide customers through troubleshooting steps. For example:

* Retail bots help locate products or check stock availability.
* Utility company bots assist with billing inquiries or service interruptions.

Self-service tools empower customers to take charge of their requests, freeing up staff to focus on more complex cases.

# 12. Celebrate Success Stories to Inspire Innovation

Highlighting examples of successfully resolved special requests inspires both employees and customers. Sharing these stories fosters a culture of creativity and problem-solving within the organization while showcasing the business’s commitment to excellence.

# a) Employee Recognition Programs

Recognizing team members who excel at handling special requests motivates others to adopt similar practices. For example:

* Highlighting “Employee of the Month” achievements in newsletters or meetings.
* Offering bonuses or rewards for exceptional customer service.

# b) Customer Testimonials

Sharing testimonials from satisfied customers reinforces the value of accommodating special requests. For example:

* Posting reviews on social media or websites.
* Featuring success stories in marketing campaigns.

# c) Case Studies

Detailed case studies break down how specific challenges were overcome, providing actionable insights for other teams. For example:

* Documenting how a hotel managed a last-minute wedding booking during peak season.
* Explaining how a tech company resolved a critical software bug for a major client.

Celebrating successes creates a positive feedback loop, encouraging continued innovation and dedication to customer satisfaction.

# 13. Balance Creativity with Compliance

While creativity is crucial for addressing special requests, it must always align with legal, ethical, and operational standards. Businesses must ensure that any solution adheres to industry regulations, safety protocols, and company values.

# a) Legal Considerations

Ensure that all accommodations comply with relevant laws and regulations. For example:

* Food establishments must adhere to health codes when modifying recipes.
* Financial institutions must follow anti-money laundering guidelines when processing unusual transactions.

# b) Ethical Standards

Maintain integrity by avoiding compromises that could harm the business or its stakeholders. For example:

* Refrain from overpromising benefits that cannot be delivered.
* Avoid favoritism that undermines fairness among customers or employees.

# c) Operational Feasibility

Assess whether proposed solutions are practical given available resources. For example:

* Evaluate staffing levels before committing to expedited timelines.
* Confirm inventory availability before promising substitutions.

Balancing creativity with compliance ensures that innovative solutions remain sustainable and trustworthy.

# Final Thoughts

Handling special requests without breaking company rules requires a combination of empathy, ingenuity, and strategic planning. By empowering employees, leveraging technology, fostering collaboration, and prioritizing transparency, businesses can turn challenging requests into opportunities for growth and differentiation.

Ultimately, the ability to adapt creatively while staying true to core principles reflects a business’s commitment to delivering exceptional value. In a world where customer expectations continue to evolve, mastering this skill will set organizations apart and pave the way for enduring success.

They described feeling energized, clear-headed, and even more sociable—almost a giddy, warm boost that outperformed coffee, which they said left them with crashes, anxiety, and brain fog.

According to their theory, while caffeine seems to restrict blood flow to the brain, cacao might actually enhance it—possibly thanks to compounds like theobromine. They even mentioned an unexpected bonus: increased libido. The only downside? Dark chocolate is high in copper and other heavy metals, so it might not be sustainable if you already have elevated copper levels.

Has anyone else noticed similar effects from dark chocolate? What do you think is behind these benefits? Let’s discuss—maybe it’s more than just taste!",1,1742719504.0,NootropicsinAustralia,0,1.0,False

Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster. Settle in, this is long. 

So I’ve had an horrific day and just want to get some…feedback, on my handling of a pretty rough situation. 

My husband (37M) and I (34F) took our two year old out for an early Mother’s Day coffee with my in laws. This group consisted of my husband, our toddler, mother in law, father in law, sister in law, brother in law and their 3 year old as well as myself. 

Now I’ve always been a shy and anxious person, my husband and I have been together for almost 18 years, he’s used to me being non confrontational and passive in public then having a cry or rant when in the comfort of my own space, be it the house, car, etc. I didn’t really get to know my husbands family for a long time out of body confidence issues and my alternative style - his family are as vanilla as they get whereas I’m heavier set and had bright hair, multiple tattoos and piercings. My husband also caught his mother and sister stalking my MySpace page (yes, I’m THAT old) at the start of our relationship and discussed between themselves how my piercings and hair were ruining me. We’ve always gotten on until last summer. I’ve been having a lot of serious health stuff go on as well as going through multiple rounds of IVF and miscarriages to finally be blessed with our little gremlin (I promise, it’s a term of endearment, he’s perfection in my eyes!), so I’d pulled back from a lot of meet ups with my husbands family. Last summer we were all meant to go away together for a weekend, nothing overseas or major like that. I then saw our family WhatsApp group flash up a notification on my phone screen and was horrified and took screen shots so fast my phone could barely understand what was going on. I then opened the app to see they’d been deleted. THANK GOD FOR SCREENSHOTTING. My sister in law was dragging me for filth about how she bets I’ll not ‘bother’ going and that my husband and child will be begging their parents to cancel their apartment stay to get the money back and ask to shack up with his parents in theirs. I saw the red haze and finally stood up for myself. I told her how nasty she was for clearly being comfortable insulting me to their mother behind my back but always complains to my face she wants to spend more time with me. I told her that as she’s nearing 40, she needs to grow up and focus on her own life. Side note - She’s had a strange obsession with what I wear in more recent years, sadly I’ve lost a lot of my colourfulness and have gravitated towards the beige mum style. So any new shoes, bags and even a necklace my husband surprised me with with my sons initials engraved on to it after his birth, she has bought and flaunted shortly after. She then fought back saying how ‘it was true’ what she said, I said she should have said it outright not now she was being confronted due to her own stupidity and not checking it went to the right chat group. She then went in an odd direction by saying how she wants to be close to me and I should reach out more. I told her that her first messages where the exact reason I wouldn’t be bothering going forward. I put everything aside and still went for the weekend, put on the typical people pleaser front and made nice. I did it for my son, I would never do or say anything negative in front of him, kids are off limits. My husbands family acted like nothing happened and we have seemed to merge back into normality again…

Fast forward to today, we’d finished coffee and went for a walk around the shops as a group. Our little one was able to use a mini shopping trolley (cart in other countries) designed for kids and went along helping us do some food shopping. Now, we’ve entered the ‘terrible twos’ headfirst and our little gremlin is definitely happy to let us all know how he feels. When I was paying for the shopping, my husband took little one to put the trolley away. I found the in laws and asked where my husband was, my sister in law rolled her eyes and tutted as we hear a loud cry and squeal. Ah, that’s my boy. I was annoyed at her attitude but went to get them both and talk little one down from WW3. He then wanted me to carry him, still roaring the shop down. As I walked past the in laws, sister in law said to her son (a year older than mine) ‘see, you’re a good boy’. I almost lost it and just walked fast and for the exit. I was anxious enough that my child was getting lots of head turns and he wasn’t calming down, my mother in law was further down the shop, nearer to the exit and saw my face. She asked what was wrong and I simply said ‘your daughter is a piece of work’ whilst walking back to the car in the carpark. I got myself and son in to the car and waited quietly for my husband. I didn’t want to fight, I just wanted to remove myself from the situation. Everyone then swarmed the car to ‘say goodbye’ to my son. His mother opened my door to give me a hug goodbye, saying ‘don’t know what all that was about’ and I said ‘you’re going to side with your daughter, I can’t help that but I will not have my son used as an example of poor behaviour whilst saying how her child is being a good boy’. My brother in law was at the other side of the car, leaned in and snapped ‘lose the attitude’ in the most threatening tone. He’s never said more than two words to me in all these years. So I looked him dead in the eyes and said ‘or what? Is that a threat?’ he then rolled his eyes and said goodbye to my son, fussing over him more than usual to make a weird point. Sister in law then said she didn’t do anything wrong to which I said ‘you said how your child was being good, right as my sobbing child is being carried in front of you, as if my child isn’t good or my parenting isn’t good. I walked out and didn’t want to hear it, if you didn’t mean it as a dig, why say it there at that moment? I’m not going to do this in front of the kids. I’m done’. She then said how I talk to the family like a thug and I’m a disgrace. I genuinely felt her husbands words were threatening and I asked a valid question in response - if I didn’t ’lose the attitude’ what was going to happen? She was shouting, bear in mind, they’re all surrounding the car and in a public car park, the only thug was her. My family are rougher around the edges with each having a…colourful life and I knew what she was getting at, another dig at me and my family. I’ve always been the black sheep of the family, quiet and never in trouble, so she clearly made a vile jab at my family. She said I’m a bitch and a disgrace - I was sat in the car with my two year old after removing myself and child from an uncomfortable situation that I didn’t want us to be in any longer. She spoke like that in front of two toddlers, but I’m the thug?! My husband didn’t hear much of this as he was fighting with the pushchair in the back of the car so didn’t step in or fight in my corner, making it look like he agreed with them. His sister then shouted she is only going to see my son with my husband and not me, like she has control or authority over my own womb fruit. I had my husband leave me at my parents house and only now, 5 hours on have I finally spoken to him. He’s horrified and livid about what has been said but he’s so bloody passive he won’t say anything, despite him saying he will.

So please help me out, was I the arsehole? Should I have done things differently? I’m struggling to see how removing myself and child from the situation was worth being surrounded and ripped to shreds? ",4,1742719268.0,AITAH,7,0.84,False

# Prologue - A Visit to Schale

([OST 10 - Romantic Smile](https://youtu.be/EBnOCXXg91o?si=2DzqV_QCmUssfK-E))

\[at the Schale Building\]

*Today was the exact day that Sensei was very much looking forward to. The day where he gets to sit back, relax, kick back on his couch, sip some coffee, and catch up on all the new student applications to Schale for the next few hours.* 

Arona: “Ah, Sensei! We’ve got a few new applications since last week!”

Arona (excited): “Oh? What’s this? An application from Arius!”

*This piqued Sensei’s interest. Ever since…* 

*\*\*Sensei’s mind flashed with images of decrepit buildings, Arius Squad, Atsuko, and Mika…\*\** 

*…all of that, Sensei hasn’t actually heard much from Arius Satellite School. And between everything that’s been happening elsewhere in Kivotos needing his attention, all he could do was wish the students there the best of luck.* 

Sensei: “Thank you, Arona. I’ll read it right away.”

Arona: “Got it Sensei! Sending it over now!”

*Opening up the student application on the Shittim Chest, Sensei’s eyes began to scan over the information present. Was this really the first student application from the school since Arius Squad’s?*  

*2nd Year…*

*Arius Satellite School…*

*Striker…*

*Tank…*

*SMG…*

*2 Star…* 

*As Sensei was finishing up his scan, his eyes shifted to an unusual inclusion.* 

Sensei: “A recommendation letter?”

*It was from Captain Mine of the Remedial Knights*

*The next day…*

*Sensei was finishing up paperwork for the evening, as he did so he kept a mental note to check the time. There was something he was looking forward to today, so much that he asked Arona to set up a timer for him.* 

Arona: “Sensei! It’s 12:00 PM!”

Sensei (smiling): “Thanks for the reminder Arona, I knew I could count on you.”

*Sensei made sure to give his hard-working assistant a pat on the head for her good work before heading to the Schale Lounge.* 

Arona: “Ehehe…”

*As expected, there she was, the girl from the Schale application. As far as he could tell, she was indeed an Arius student, her uniform was exactly that of the myriad of Arius students he’d seen before, besides her armband signifying her affiliation with the Remedial Knights. She was talking with some other girls, her gasmask slung by her belt. They were chatting like any other group of friends in Kivotos, though she paused when Sensei came into view.* 

Sensei: “Hello, you must be Genevieve. Come on in.”

Arius Volunteer: “...” 

Remedial Knights Student A: “It’s ok, you can do this.” 

*With that last bit of encouragement, the Arius girl got up and followed Sensei into his office. Though she didn’t say it, Sensei could tell how nervous she was. It was a natural reaction, he’d likely be nervous if he was in her shoes. As the door closed behind them, the atmosphere remained as tense and awkward as ever. Something had to give.*

(No OST)

Sensei: “Welcome to Schale. I’m Sensei, it’s nice to meet you Genevieve.”

Arius Volunteer: “It’s nice to meet you as well, Schale’s Sensei.”

Sensei: “...”

Arius Volunteer: “...” 

Sensei: “Wait, have we met before?”

Arius Volunteer: “We have, but…”

Sensei: “But…?” 

Arius Volunteer: “Ah… you see, it was during the assassination attempt on Nagisa. I was one of the soldiers standing behind Mika-san.”

Sensei: “...I see.”

Arius Volunteer: “...”

Sensei: “...” 

*The awkwardness somehow got worse. Sensei desperately needed to change the topic. Then he spotted something that could do the trick.*

([OST 21 - Midnight Trip](https://youtu.be/KopFUu0F4gk?si=ZsBhm4yqgV8MQWJ6))

Sensei: “That’s a pretty necklace you’ve got there. Stained-glass I reckon. Where did you get it from?”

Arius Volunteer: “I made it myself. And yeah, it is stained-glass.”

*The girl seemed to smile as she held her necklace up as if presenting it to Sensei. It was made with bits of shattered multicolored glass tied onto a white string. Of course it likely wouldn’t sell in a jewelry store, but Sensei could tell a lot of heart and effort was put into creating it.* 

Sensei: “If you don’t mind, could you tell me about how you made it?” 

Arius Volunteer: “R-really? Ok, it’s a long story though.” 

Sensei: “A long story? I should probably break out the refreshments then.”

Arius Volunteer: “Wait, if it’s too long, I can just tell you about the process itself. You’re probably super busy and all…”

Sensei: “No, I have plenty of time today. I’d like to hear the long version, if you don’t mind of course.”

Arius Volunteer: “Alright, if you say so.”

Arius Volunteer: “But fair warning, Sensei.”

Sensei: “?”

Arius Volunteer: “It’s not a pleasant story.”

Sensei: “...”

Arius Volunteer: “So, Sensei… even after I said that…”

Arius Volunteer: “Will you still hear me out?”

*As Sensei grabbed some coffee and snacks for the two of them to share, Genevieve began recounting the chain of events that led her to crafting that necklace of hers.*

# Episode 1 - Arius Days I

([OST 55 - Moment](https://youtu.be/icycOtSlAmU?si=gkuHFLQWvE8NnCC5))

*Somewhere in Arius District, 5 years before Sensei’s arrival…*

*It was raining heavily in Arius District that day. A young Genevieve was lagging behind the rest of her unit, desperate to catch up.*

Arius Youth: “Huff.. huff.. Ah-!”

***\*\*SPLASH\*\**** 

Arius Youth: “Ow… w-wait up-!” 

???: “What are you doing?”

Arius Youth: “!”

*She turned around to see her drill instructor standing above her.* 

Arius Officer: “Thought you could take a break, huh? Lazy mutt!” 

***\*\*KICK\*\**** 

Arius Youth: “Gah-!?”

 ***\*\*KICK\*\* \*\*KICK\*\* \*\*STOMP\*\****

Arius Youth: “...stop… please…” 

Arius Officer: “I’ve had it with this unit’s pathetic performance. I promised Madame to lash you ingrates into shape, and I meant every word of it.” 

*The instructor pulled out a baton, Genevieve’s eyes widened with dread.* 

Arius Officer: “Don’t worry, I won’t punish your whole squad this time.” 

Arius Officer: “It’ll all be on you.” 

***\*\*CRACK\*\* \*\*KICK\*\* \*\*STOMP\*\****

*It was hours later. Within the remains of a crumbling church, Genevieve was being attended to by an older Arius Student.*

Arius Youth: “It hurts…”

Arius Student A: “I understand, just bear with me.”

*The older student softly applied alcohol to the wounds of the young girl to disinfect them. Lashes, deep cuts to the point of bleeding. How many times did they hit her to hurt a haloed student this badly?*

Arius Student A: “How did it even get to this point? What happened…?”

Arius Youth: “...”

Arius Youth: “I don’t want to talk about it.”

Arius Student A: “It’s ok, you don’t have to.” 

*…*

Arius Student A: “What’s your name kid? Mine is Livila.”

Arius Youth: “Genevieve…”

Arius Youth: “It’s nice to meet you Livila.”

Arius Student A: “It’s good to meet you too, Genevieve.”

*A few months later, in the Instructor’s Office for Unit IV.* 

Arius Student A: “I’d like for Reserve Student #513197 to be given the role as a surgeon assistant under Unit IV’s medical and logistics company.”

Arius Officer: “Genevieve? That brat? Why would you want some useless kid like her?” 

Arius Student A: “With all due respect, she has been incredibly helpful as a volunteer for us. Me and the other medics agree that she has potential.”

Arius Officer: “No.”

Arius Student A: “Huh-?”

Arius Officer: “You heard me. My answer is no.”

Arius Student A: “But sir-”

**Arius Officer: “I SAID NO!!”** 

*The Instructor kicked his table over violently, sending stacks of paper and various items hurtling towards a genuinely started Livila.* 

**Arius Officer: “YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST WALTZ IN HERE AND DEMAND SUCH A THING!? YOU INSOLENT FOOL!”**

**Arius Officer: “I CALL THE SHOTS HERE! I SHOULD BEAT YOU TO AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE RIGHT HERE AND NOW FOR EVEN DARING TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!”** 

Arius Student A (scared): “...”

**Arius Officer: “NOTHING TO SAY? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR COCKY ATTITUDE JUST NOW, HUH!?”**

Arius Student A: “I wasn-”

**\*\*SLAP\*\***

**Arius Officer: “DON’T TALK BACK TO ME!”**

*Livila recoiled, looking up in terror at the adult towering over her. Just when he looked as if he was about to strike again, he suddenly stopped.* 

Arius Officer: “You’ve entertained me enough for today.”

Arius Officer: “I’ll tell the girl my decision personally.”

Arius Officer: “Now go. Get out of my sight.”

*Broken out of her shock, Livila quickly left the room. She ran all the way back to the dilapidated church where Unit IV’s medical wing was housed. Panting for breath, she had just enough time to put on her face mask and cover up the slap mark before Genevieve came to greet her.* 

Arius Youth (Happy): “Liv!” 

*The girl was cheerful as ever, even though she still had to walk with a crutch after all this time.* 

Arius Student A (Smiling): “Genevieve! How have you been?” 

Arius Youth: “I’ve been doing great!”

Arius Youth: “Oh! I want to show you something, Liv!”

*Livila saw the young girl present a necklace made out of some string and shards of colorful stained glass. The way light shone through each dancing shard was positively mesmerizing.* 

Arius Student A: “Woah, I’d never seen anything so beautiful like that before.” 

Arius Youth: “I know, right? Melia gave this to me for helping out with comforting the patients.”

Arius Student A: “Heh, isn’t that a bit vain? After all-”

Arius Youth: “Vanitas Vanitatum, et Omnia Vanitas. I know I know, but it looks so pretty, and everyone I show it to loves it!”

Arius Student A: “Fine, kid. You can keep the necklace.”

*Livila ruffles up Genevieve’s hair as the younger girl smiles brightly.* 

Arius Student A: “Just make sure to take it off when you go to bed, don’t want you getting cuts or anything like that.” 

Arius Youth: “Ok, I will. Thank you so much Liv!” 

*Genevieve gave Livila a hug, using her Senpai as her support as her crutch clattered onto the floor.* 

*After a moment of hesitation, the older girl hugged back. This always took Livila by surprise, she could never get used to this feeling.* 

Arius Student A: “Ah, I have something that I need to attend to.” 

*Livila reached down and grabbed Genevieve’s crutch, fixing it back into place under the girl’s right arm.* 

Arius Student A: “Keep on doing your best. Promise to talk to you later, right Vivi?”

Arius Youth (smiling): “Right!” 

*As Genevieve hobbled along to assist the other medics, Livila shifted her attention to an onlooker to their exchange.*

Arius Student A: “Melia.”

Arius Student B: “Livila.” 

Arius Student A: “You have something to say?”

Arius Student B: “I do. It’s about the girl.”

Arius Student B: “You can’t keep sheltering her like this.” 

Arius Student A: “I know.” 

Arius Student B: “Then why? Why keep her in the dark?”

Arius Student A: “She already suffered enough, this is the least we can do for her, isn’t it?” 

Arius Student B: “No, it’s not.”

Arius Student B: “Look, I understand that she suffered, but she’s going to continue to suffer. That’s just how the world works, we’re all born to suffer.” 

Arius Student A: “...”

Arius Student B: “No matter how much you shield her, there will be a day you’re not going to be around anymore. And then what?”

Arius Student A: “She’ll still have you, won’t she? I saw that necklace you gave her. You care about her too.”

Arius Student B: “O-of course I care about her! We all do!”

Arius Student A: “Then it’s settled. You’re going to be her new caretaker after I’m gone.”

Arius Student B: “!”

Arius Student B: “Seriously, Senpai…? You’re joking…”

Arius Student A: “No, I’m 100% serious. You’re gonna be a great Senpai, Melia! In fact, you’re already one. Can’t you see how much Vivi admires you?” 

Arius Student B: “Gah, what’s wrong with you…? How can you be this carefree? You were never like this before!” 

Arius Student A: “Well… ever since a little angel entered our lives, the world doesn’t feel so bleak anymore.” 

Arius Student B: “...”

Arius Student A (smug): “You know I’m right.” 

Arius Student B: “...”

Arius Student B: “Fine, you got me. I swear to look after Genevieve after you graduate. Happy Livila?” 

Arius Student A: “Very much so. Thank you Melia, from the bottom of my heart.”

Arius Student B: “Shut up… I’m not doing this for you.”

*ATTENTION UNIT IV: IT IS NOW 20:00 PM. CURFEW IS NOW IN PLACE. RETURN TO YOUR SLEEPING QUARTERS IMMEDIATELY.* 

Arius Student B: “Oh, we better wrap everything up.” 

Arius Student A: “On it.” 

*The medical staff set aside and secured everything before departing to their sleeping quarters, only leaving behind a small force behind to guard the patients for the night. Unit IV’s accommodation was mainly in a refurbished warehouse surrounded by tents and houses made out of planks of wood and corrugated metal. It was practically a slum, yet for the students here, it was home.*

*As Melia was busy cooking dinner on a small fire outside, and Livila was writing down a report in their tent for the day, the latter spotted a small figure at the tent’s entrance.*

Arius Student A: “Vivi, you should be asleep right now.”

Arius Youth: “I know, but you promised we’d get to talk, right?”

Arius Student A: “I did, so… what do you want to talk about? How about the story about the Knight? It’s your favorite, isn’t it?”

Arius Youth: “Your cheek, are you ok?”

*Livila was completely taken aback. For a moment, she didn’t say anything. She had forgotten all about it.* 

Arius Student A: “Yeah, I’m ok, it doesn’t hurt.”

Arius Youth: “...it was him wasn’t it?”

Arius Student A: “It was. I wanted to see if he’d agree for you to join us in an official capacity. You could probably guess his answer.” 

*Genevieve suddenly hugged Livila*

Arius Student A: “Woah, Vivi. Where is this coming from?”

Arius Youth (softly): “...please don’t go… I don’t want to lose you…”

Arius Student A: “...” 

Arius Student A: “I won’t. I promise.”

*The two remained like that for a while, holding each other as if this were their last embrace. After a while, Livila pulled away and gave Genevieve a warm smile.* 

Arius Student A: “No matter what, we’ll always be together. Got it?”

Arius Youth (smiling): “Got it.”

Arius Student A: “It’s getting late now. You should probably head inside the warehouse with all the other reserve students. The tents aren’t exactly warm or comfortable for sleeping, y'know.” 

Arius Youth: “Of course Liv. I’ll see you tomorrow!”

Arius Student A: “You too, good night Vivi.”

*As Genevieve ran off, waving back to Livila with a bright smile, the older girl waved farewell as well. Maybe she was being too optimistic back there, together forever? It was quite an absurd promise, but Livila couldn’t help but hope that it would come true.* 

*At Midnight…*

*\*Rustle Rustle\**

Arius Youth: “Hmm…?”

???: “Wake up.”

???: “Get ready to move. Now.” 

*Genevieve found herself being dragged out of her bunk, barely able to see in the darkness, or able to register anything except a muffled voice.*

*Yet as quickly as she was woken up, her crutch was placed under her arm and she was rushed out of the warehouse.*

*When her vision cleared, she was able to make out 2 Arius Soldiers, definitely older than her, and sporting distinct IIs on their uniforms. They travelled for quite some time, eventually finding themselves in a rundown plaza somewhere far away.*

Arius Gendarmerie A: “We’ve brought Reserve Student #513197, Instructor Darius.”

Arius Officer: “Good, leave us be.” 

Arius Gendarmerie B: “Understand that this is your last accommodation. You will receive no more favors after tonight.” 

*With that, the two Arius soldiers left the scene, leaving only Genevieve and her Instructor alone. Genevieve was rightfully nervous, was she in trouble?*

Arius Officer: “Genevieve, I wanted to congratulate you tonight. You have been accepted as a surgeon assistant into the Medical and Logistics Company of Arius Unit IV.”

Arius Youth: “R-really?” 

Arius Officer: “Yes, see for yourself.”

*He handed her a piece of paper. Genevieve gingerly took the document into her hand, and with every line she read her heart only beat faster and faster. It was official, signed by both the Instructor and the head of the Medical Company herself. It was everything Genevieve could’ve wanted!*

Arius Officer: “That’s a nice smile you have there. I’ve never seen that expression before.” 

*Genevieve looked up, surprised, touching her face as if confirming that she was indeed smiling.*

Arius Officer: “Were you perhaps happy that you wouldn’t have to see me again?” 

Arius Youth: “Wha-”

***\*\*SLAP\*\****

Genevieve fell hard onto the ground, her crutch knocked out of her arm and falling to the side. 

Arius Youth: “Eek-?!”

*Genevieve tried reaching for her crutch, but before she could grab it, the Instructor stomped on it repeatedly, shattering it into splinters and pieces of broken wood.* 

**Arius Officer: “THOUGHT YOU COULD ESCAPE FROM ME, HUH!? DIRTY LITTLE RAT!”** 

*Genevieve tried to crawl away, but the Instructor stopped her by stomping on her injured leg.*

**Arius Youth: “AAAAHHHHHHH-!!!”**

*“I-It hurts! It hurts so much!”*

*The Instructor took this opportunity to kick Genevieve in the stomach, sending her sprawling onto the ground.*

**Arius Officer: “YOU WERE TRYING TO RUN!! WEREN’T YOU?!!”**

***\*\*KICK\*\****

**Arius Officer: “STUPID TRASH!! DO I HAVE TO BEAT THIS LESSON INTO YOU BRATS OVER AND OVER AGAIN!?”**

***\*\*STOMP\*\* \*\*KICK\*\* \*\*STOMP\*\**** 

**Arius Officer: “THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, IT’LL ALL BE IN VAIN!!”**

***\*\*KICK\*\* \*\*STOMP\*\* \*\*CRACK\*\****

Arius Youth (Sobbing): “S-stop! Please! I-I’m sorry!” 

**Arius Officer: “SHUT UP!! WHO SAID YOU CAN TALK!? HUH!?”**

*The Instructor delivered another hard stomp on Genevieve’s leg, causing her to shriek loudly in pain and for her halo to flicker.*

**Arius Youth: “AAAAAAHHHHHH-!!!!”** 

*As she laid there in agony, the Instructor grabbed her by her hair, lifting her up painfully, inspecting her tearfilled face with a smile.*

Arius Officer: “What’s this?” 

*He grabbed her necklace, tearing it from her neck in one swift motion.*

Arius Officer: “Oh, did those medical students give this to you? How… sentimental.”

*He dropped the necklace onto the ground, stomping on it, and grinding it with the heel of his boot until it was nothing but dust. Genevieve could do nothing but look on and cry.*

Arius Officer: “You were always my favorite, Genevieve. Always so weak and pathetic, like your whole rotten unit, but you were just the worst. The only time I ever got any satisfaction from this dead end job is when I’m beating you senseless.” 

Arius Officer: “You want to know why? **Because you’re a worthless piece of filth, that deserves to die, and no one is going to miss you.**” 

Arius Youth (Crying): “...”

Arius Officer: “So please, do entertain me one last time.”

*The Next Morning…*

*Footsteps clatter as search patrols from Unit IV scatter across Arius District. The disappearance of Genevieve along with an anonymous tip has sent the whole unit into a frenzy. Livila was approaching a plaza after a student from Unit II identified it as a place of suspicion. As she turned the corner, she saw…*

Arius Student A: “Genevieve!? Genevieve!” 

*Livila rushed towards Genevieve’s bloody and bruised body, eyes staring lifelessly into the distance.*

Arius Student A: “No no no no… Genevieve, please wake up!” 

*Her halo was gone, she was bleeding from so many places. Livila’s hands were drenched in blood the moment she touched the poor girl.*

*She checked her pulse, desperate for something, anything. Her hands couldn’t stop trembling…*

Arius Student A: “Vivi… please…”

Arius Student A: “I’m so sorry… I should have… I should have never…”

Arius Student A: ”Please live, just… please…” 

Arius Student B: “Over here! Medical team over here!” 

*Unit IV medics arrived quickly, immediately setting up equipment to save Genevieve’s life. Despite all their efforts, her condition was only getting worse and worse.*

Arius Student C: “We’re losing her!” 

Arius Student D: “She lost too much blood!” 

*Watching all of this, Livila could only stare blankly at the scene in front of her, her hands and uniform drenched in the blood of the person she swore- no, failed to protect. Genevieve was going to die, and it was all her fault…*

*Having run out of tears, Livila only gave Melia an exhausted look before leaving the plaza. When she arrived at his place, she didn’t knock, she just shot the door handle, and let herself in.*

\[at Beatrice’s Throne Room\]

Arius Intelligence Officer: “Victim was an adult male, 34 years of age. Cause of death: blood loss, blunt trauma.”

Arius Intelligence Officer: “Perpetrator is Livila from Unit IV, she did not resist arrest.”

Beatrice: “Good riddance. Darius was a worthless tool, I was going to dispose of him down the line anyways.”

Beatrice: “Still, a student murdering an adult? Troubling. We wouldn’t want any replications of this stunt would we? Prepare a public execution.”

Arius Intelligence Officer: “...yes Madame.”

*Genevieve remained in a coma for 6 months.*

# Episode 2 - Arius Days II

*5 years later…*

*Shortly into the Arius Reclamation Operation*

**\*\*Gunfire\*\***

Arius Soldier: “Ah-!” 

*\*Collapses\**

*Can’t move…*

Justice Task Force Member: “Room cleared! Advance!”

(OST 35 - Morose Dreamer)

*As Genevieve laid sprawled out on the floor, sounds of gunfire and footsteps running past her growing faint, she couldn’t lament the futility of her situation. All those years of training, every hardship she had to go through to reach this point?*

*“This is the result of all our suffering…? Useless… it was all useless.”*

*As the world faded to black, Genevieve let herself be consumed by it. It felt as if she was freefalling into a dark void, she felt peaceful as the color drained from her mind. Yet faint as ever, she spotted two figures in the midst of her darkness, they looked like…*

*“Livila? Melia? Is that you? Where are you going!?*

*Genevieve ran and ran, but with each step she took it felt as if they were only getting further and further away. Her foot sank into the darkness, it became harder to move. “Come back! P-please don’t leave me here! I need you…! I need… I… please…”*

*She was sinking, the darkness was overtaking her, grabbing her limbs and pulling her into a place of no return.* 

Arius Soldier: “Gah-!?”

*A nightmare…? And… she was in a prison cell. Of course. What else did Genevieve expect? This was to be her fate, to be left here to rot for the rest of her days.* 

Justice Task Force Guard: “Oh, you’re awake.”

Justice Task Force Guard: “You must be hungry, have a meal.”

*The guard slides a tray of food through the opening in the bars. It was a bowl of miso soup.*

Arius Soldier: “…”

Justice Task Force Guard: “Are you not going to eat?”

Justice Task Force Guard: “The food might be stale, but at least it’s better than the stuff they serve at Gehenna.”

Arius Soldier: “…”

Justice Task Force Guard: “Seriously…? It’s getting cold, and the microwaves here aren’t really top-notch.” 

Arius Soldier: “Ok.”

*Genevieve got up from her bed and went over to the guard, she managed to muster a weak smile.* Arius Soldier: “Thank you.” 

*The Guard was quite surprised, usually she’d get curses or have the soup bowl thrown back at her, but this was the first time she was thanked.* 

Justice Task Force Guard: “Right, enjoy the meal.”

*The guard nodded before walking away. Genevieve waited for the guard to exit her field of view before she carefully placed the miso bowl on the floor of the cell. She went back to lying in bed.* 

*As the days went on, the amount of uneaten miso bowls kept piling up. No matter what the guards tried doing, she simply refused to eat.*

(No OST)

Justice Task Force Guard: “She hasn’t eaten or drank anything for days. At this rate…”

???: “Don’t worry, leave it to me.” 

*Genevieve is lying on her bed, staring blankly into the wall. She had long lost track of time, all she could do was wait until her body gave out from deprivation.*

???: “Hello?”

*The Arius student turned over, checking to see who was out there. It was a Trinity student with sky-blue hair sporting a white dress and what seemed to be a flossie.* 

???: “May I come in?”

Arius Soldier: “...I wouldn’t be able to stop you.”

???: “I’ll take that as a yes.”

*The prison door slides open, the student enters the cell.*

(OST 105 - Alkaline Tears)

???: “You must be Genevieve.” 

Arius Soldier: “I am.”

???: “Why are you starving yourself?”

Arius Soldier: “Because I don’t want to waste food.”

???: “Is that so? Wouldn’t you call this wasteful?”

*The girl with sky-blue hair directed her gaze at the small collection of uneaten miso bowls.* 

Arius Soldier: “I asked the guards to give it to someone else. They refused.”

???: “That food was meant for you, so why haven’t you eaten it?”

Arius Soldier: “It would’ve been wasted on me.” 

???: “Wasted? Do you believe you’re not deserving of sustenance?”

Arius Soldier: “No, I do not.” 

???: “I disagree.”

Arius Soldier: “Why? I’m your enemy, aren’t I? You should be glad not to have another mouth to feed, especially that of the enemy.”

???: “Because I am a Remedial Knight. It’s our duty to care for all peoples, despite any previous misgivings.”

Arius Soldier: “A knight you say? You don’t look like one.”

Mysterious Remedial Knights Student: “I suppose not. We don’t have shining armor or greatswords, but the Remedial Knights is about more than being just a warrior. It’s about the spirit and conviction to help others, in that sense we more than justify our title as Knights, protectors and caretakers of those in need.”

Mysterious Remedial Knights Student: “My apologies if that was a lot to take in. I tend to get rather passionate about these sorts of things.”

Arius Soldier: “No offense taken.” 

Arius Soldier: “It was kind of cool actually, reminds me of the bedtime stories I used to hear.”

Mysterious Remedial Knights Student: “Thank you, I’m glad to hear that.” 

(No OST)

Mysterious Remedial Knights Student: “My name is Aomori Mine. It’s nice to meet you, Genevieve.” 

Arius Soldier: “It’s nice to meet you too, Mine.”

Mine: “You know, when I first got here, I believed you to be some sort of agitator. The reports say you’ve gotten some other Arius students to go on hunger strikes as well.”

Mine: “But now that I’ve spoken to you, gotten to know not the file reports, but the real you, I can say with certainty that you are not that. There’s a subtle selflessness and empathy that I see in you. You’re a good person.”

Arius Soldier: “...a good person?”

*Genevieve scoffs*

Arius Soldier: “I tried to kill you. What makes me good?”

Mine: “You haven’t.”

Mine: “This is the first time we’ve met. How could you have possibly tried to kill me before then?”

*Her logic was sound, if a bit simplistic. Genevieve was forced to give Mine some serious consideration.* 

Mine:  “Understand that I cannot force your hand. I cannot make you eat or drink no matter how much I wish, because that is your choice at the end of the day.” 

Mine: “However, I don’t want you to starve or rot here. So instead I’ll give you a choice.”

Mine: “I’ve seen your files. You weren’t particularly skilled as a combatant, but you were once a medic in your unit, a good one at that. I don’t want that talent or spirit to waste away here.”

Mine: “I want you to join the Remedial Knights.”

(OST 22 - Daily Routine 24/7)

Arius Soldier: “...” 

*Genevieve stared in silent awe. The offer felt too good to be true, as if it was a trap or some ruse in service of an ulterior motive.*

Mine: “Of course, you’d be joining as a volunteer. Full membership requires you to be a Trinity Student, and with the current political attitudes it would be… difficult to arrange.” 

Mine: “Still, the Remedial Knights are currently short-staffed operating here in Arius District as well as Trinity. We need all the help we can get these days.”

Arius Soldier: “You would have me?”

Mine: “I’d be honored.”

Arius Soldier: “Are you sure that can be done? What would your superiors think of recruiting an Arius student?”

Mine: “It’s a good thing I’m Captain of the Remedial Knights then.”

Arius Soldier: “What.”

*That was one hell of a bombshell. Genevieve had the feeling that she would’ve been much more cooperative if Mine had stated her rank from the start.*

Mine; Captain of the Remedial Knights: “In any case, will you join us? I have a feeling you’d be a great addition to our ranks.” 

*Mine offered her hand to Genevieve, a determined yet kind smile on the Knights Captain’s face.*

Mine; Captain of the Remedial Knights: “What do you say, Genevieve?”

(No OST)

*Next week…*

([OST 021 - Midnight Trip](https://youtu.be/KopFUu0F4gk?si=ZsBhm4yqgV8MQWJ6))

*Genevieve adjusted her Remedial Knights armband as she pivoted her body to and fro in the front of the mirror. It was still too loose for her liking, ever since she’d gotten noticeably thinner from not eating for 5 days straight.* 

*Plenty has happened since then. She had been accepted into the Remedial Knights as a volunteer, not exactly a member, but still under the same command and fulfilling the same duties nonetheless. By then she had already apologized to both the prison chef and that Justice Task Force Guard, the former for not eating their food, and the latter for lying to her and making her worry. She has since completed basic training alongside other Arius volunteers and newly-recruited Remedial Knights cadets from Trinity. Today was the day she would join her new team.* 

*Her uniform was practically the same as her Arius combat uniform. Apparently the higher ups in the Tea Party wanted the Remedial Knights to distinguish their official members from the Arius volunteers, and keeping the old battle uniform was the route they took. The only difference was the addition of Remedial Knights regalia such as the armband and nurse’s cap as the indicators of her affiliation. She even got to keep other Arius-made equipment such as her standard issued gas mask and submachine gun.* 

*As Genevieve caught her armband after it slipped down her arm again. She grumbled a bit, then she grabbed a safety pin and put her armband back into place. One last time, she twirled in front of the mirror, allowing herself a small smile at this small accomplishment. But her uniform wasn’t complete, not yet. The final touch, a little arts and craft project she’s been working on during training, a colorful stained-glass necklace. As she put it on, she knew then and there that she was ready.* 

Arius Volunteer: “Thank you Senpais… I’ll make you proud.”

*With that final vow, she strode through the doorway and into the beginning of her new future as a member of the Remedial Knights.*

This is my first time writing this sort of thing. Needless to say, if you have any criticisms for things such as pacing, descriptions, format, dialogue, etc. they are 100% appreciated. The newest thing I’m unfamiliar with is OST choice and placement. I think I’ll try improving on that going forward.

1jhumwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1jhumwj/mcas_histamine_intolerance_gut_issues_rosacea/,MCAS? Histamine Intolerance? Gut Issues? Rosacea?,"I’m really stuck on what’s going on with me at the moment as my symptoms are baffling me but wondered if anyone going through trying to figure out a diagnosis has experienced anything similar or think any of the triggers seem familiar.

I’m 25,f and I’ve never really had any allergy issues in my life. There is a family history of hayfever and pollen, which I don’t have and a few family members get a bit bloated after eating fresh garlic. I have a slight reaction to this but only really see it when I eat stuff like Garlic Bread. I have also always gone bright red while exercising (not sure if this is relevant)

I cut all alcohol and red meat from my diet about 6 years ago and mainly eat veggie meats, chicken and a fair bit of fish. I suffer from anxiety with big focus on health anxiety and was on medication for it during lockdown but have since stopped. A lot of it was unconscious anxiety so I didn’t know what was causing it but I’d get that dread feeling out of nowhere and then have a panic attack.

October 2024, I go to Japan for holiday and although it was an amazing experience there were a couple of things that are now making me think are triggers. First I had really bad jet lag and basically went 36hrs no sleep with activities on top of that and made myself ill. We went to a fish market to make sushi and I ate loads of it. I had no reaction from the sushi but the next day had some tempura prawn ramen for dinner and had my first reaction - my checks got really red and hot, it went round the back of my neck, headache and dizzy feeling. Took an antihistamine and was fine. I thought this might be a bit of bad prawn and didn’t think anything of it. I cut prawns from the rest of the trip but still ate some other stuff like salmon, octopus and tuna - again no reaction.

On the flight home, again the jet lag hit me quite badly and the meal was sushi and cheese and I felt a bit dizzy or had vertigo during my stop over. I put this down to the time change and the fact I slept the entire first flight laying flat.

I arrive back home and within two days I come down with a particularly nasty chest infection/ flu that put me in bed for a few days and had to be given an asthma pump and antibiotics. I thought this might be something from the plane.

I was going on with life normally and a couple of weeks cooked my self a prawn stir fry and immediately afterwards had the facial flushing afterwards, not as bad as Japan but it was there. I stopped eating them, asked my GP for a shellfish allergy test and carried on as usual just avoiding shellfish. A few weeks later the same thing happens after cooking myself some sea bass and I get worried it’s all fish despite the fact i had been regularly eating smoked salmon and had calamari since coming back home.

I cut out all fish from my diet and decide to just wait for my allergy test to get it confirmed. This is where we get to around February time and the reactions start happening randomly and things I was eating in December and January were fine and now there not:

Feb reactions:
- Salt and Vinegar Crisps
- Black Tea (only once but fine otherwise)
- Barrista Latte - oat milk 
- Cheese Board with crackers
- Chicken Sandwich - no butter

March:
- barrista latte - normal milk
- Barrista latte - coconut milk
- gluten free katsu curry
- cold coffee
- brownie 
- hummus and celery
- banana
- gluten free, vegan corn puffs or mint tea
- bread non-chicken burger and fries
- cooked aubergine with yogurt dip and onion and chicken curry

What’s still confusing me now is that I’m eating some stuff regularly and get a reaction one day but have nothing the next. I’ve been trying different foods and have had no reaction to:

- homemade instant coffee with cows milk
- fajitas with sour cream and cheese
- chicken curry with coconut cream, onions and garlic
- waffles and pancakes
- roast chicken with potatoes 
- bananas
- oats
- pasta
- tuna steak
- chocolate mini eggs and m&ms
- kefir
- broccoli 

Other context, my house is quite old so I have quite a lot of dusty areas and mold around the windows which I try to keep clean. I seem to get blisters on my head everytime I shower and I have quite bad acne on my cheeks already. My office is also quite old and we rely more on the central heating vents than the windows for cool air based on where my desk is.

My symptoms are still pretty much just the facial flushing but until recently where it’s happening more regularly I feel like I’ve been getting a tight throat feeling like someone’s got their hand around it. I don’t know if this is an anxiety thing as it sometimes goes away and sometimes stays a long while after my face has gone down and also seems to get worse when I focus on the feeling.

I’ve got my allergy appointment on Tuesday as well as a blood test to check for celiac and not sure what to go in and tell them to test me for as I don’t know…

I also realise my symptoms relating to MCAS aren’t as severe as others but is that cause I’m still at early stages of it and it will get worse? Or are there other subtle symptoms to look out for?

I’m not sure if it’s histamine intolerance as it seems to be happening with foods that I’ve read are low in histamine.

One of my mums friends is a nutritionist and she suggested it might be gut related or the initial prawn reaction in Japan has triggered something.

I realise I can’t be diagnosed on Reddit but my health anxiety is spiralling and any advice is greatly appreciated.

1jhultt,https://www.reddit.com/r/puremathematics/comments/1jhultt/discovered_a_local_logsymmetry_identity_in_base2/,Discovered a Local Log-Symmetry Identity in Base-2 Tetration (Up to A₅) Before Chaos Ensues — Seeking Mathematical Validation,"  
Hey r/puremathematics 

I’m not a formally trained mathematician—just someone who deeply enjoys pattern hunting. Recently while exploring **base-2 tetration** (i.e., repeated exponentiation: 2\^\^n = 2\^2\^2...n times), I discovered a **localized identity** that holds from A₃ to A₅ and then breaks dramatically at A₆.

I wanted to share this and **ask for validation, falsification, or direction**.



# ⚙️ Setup (Tetration Base 2 / Computational analogy as bit is binary ):

Let:

* A₁ = 2
* A₂ = 2\^2 = 4
* A₃ = 2\^4 = 16
* A₄ = 2\^16 = 65,536
* A₅ = 2\^65,536
* A₆ = 2\^(2\^65,536) = massive

# ✅ What I Found (Local Identity):

A **logarithmic decomposition symmetry**:

>

# 🧪 Testing the Identity:

* A₄:
   * log₂(65536) = log₂(16)\^log₂(4)
   * 16 = 4² ✅
* A₅:
   * log₂(2\^65536) = log₂(65536)\^log₂(16)
   * 65536 = 16⁴ ✅

# ⚠️ Where It Breaks (A₆ and beyond):

For A₆ = 2\^(2\^65536):

* log₂(A₆) = 2\^65536
* RHS = log₂(A₅)\^log₂(A₄) = (2\^16)\^16 = 2\^256
* Clearly: **2\^256 << 2\^65536** ❌

→ So identity **holds from A₃ to A₅**, then **collapses at A₆**—indicating a sharp **transition from structure to chaos**.

# 🌀 3 Observations from This:

1. **Seeding Phase (A₁–A₂)**
   * Initialization of the growth
   * Still indistinguishable from exponential scaling
2. **Symmetry Window (A₃–A₅)**
   * Log-based recursive identity holds
   * Recursive, symbolic growth is **decomposable & predictable**
3. **Chaos Phase (A₆ onwards)**
   * Identity shatters
   * System enters **true tetrative explosion**, recursive structure lost

# 💡 Analogy to Computation / AI:

* **Recursive systems** (like DNNs, transformers, or memory stacks) follow similar patterns:
   * Stable recursion → predictable growth → explosive, unstable computation
* Could help:
   * Predict instability points
   * Control resource allocation in growing AI systems
   * Set safe bounds in recursive model design

# 🛠️ Tools Used:

* Brain 🧠 (and a bit of obsession)
* GPT Plus (to help summarize and organize ideas, but **all pattern observation is mine**)
* Black coffee ☕
* Recursive loops of doubt → test → verify
* Whiteboard sketches

# 🧠 Final Thoughts:

I’m **not claiming this is a new theorem**—just that I **noticed something real** that seems to hold under test conditions. If it's already known, awesome—please link me. If it’s trivial, explain why. If it’s real… I’d love to develop it deeper with guidance.

Thank you in advance.

TW: injury to pets, religious trauma, mental health and medical trauma (question mark?)

I grew up in a pretty rural scattering of towns that was about a 30 min drive to the closest ""city"" (20 if you were a dumb teenager and knew where the cops liked to hide). I don't know if it was just the ""church"" community I was raised in, or actually small town shit, but i was definitely socialized with a ""everybody knows everybody, and that's not always a good thing"" kinda vibe. 

(some dumb examples of this; 1. my childhood dog was hit by a car in front of our house. He was a tough little fuck and lived another decade and I miss him to this day. I didn't find out until after he died that my mom and sister knew who hit him the entire time, because of course they did because on our lil dirt roads everyone knew everyone's car but I didn't think about that as a child worried if their dog was gonna push daisies, 2. during a stint in the psych ward, at one of my only actual in-person unsupervised or therapized visits, my mom brought one of her church ladies. my family was VERY involved in the church and it actively contributed to why I was in the psych ward in the first place, and my mom had driven 3 hours with one of the most two faced gossip-heavy women in our ""fellowship,"" because of course our entire church knew and had basically voted who should go with my mom to-- I dunno-- be a fly on the wall during one of the shittiest times of my formative years? and I still drive past the stupid hospital that committed me every time I drive around down home because it's literally the only one, and 3. I got pulled over driving my friend's car home from a night out while he napped in the back. i was going maybe 49 in a 45 and probably only got pulled over because it was one of two major roads in this town at like 2am. the ""small town"" part was the fact that my friend who owned the car had two brothers-- one who was a family man, local business owner, and volunteer firefighter... the other was mostly known as a delinquent drug user. the cop let us off with a warning as soon as he realized why he recognized my friend's name, and it was luckily through the reputable brother.)

anyway, since adulthood, I've moved to and settled in a city pretty far from my hometown with my partner. it's not any sort of glamorous relocation, there's still a lot of ag work and not a lot to do, but I absolutely adore being able to walk to work or a grocery or just for a cup of coffee. however, every time my partner and I go somewhere we're likely to run into someone who recognizes us from work, I know the name of every single of my closest corner store employees and they all know me, and if I'm ever out with someone they get a little surprised about how many people I just casually know around town. so...I haven't really escaped the small town vibe, but it's more for my own sake now I think. it's voluntary, it grounds me in my community and where I live, and fuck, I literally always have someone to talk to.

here's where the context yields to the point, I guess-- I went home recently. My sister, for the sake of support and stability, is back in the sticks, and recently I've been helping her out. Jesus Christ. first of all, its like the 80s down there. people casually using slurs, speeding or driving drunk on back county roads, treating animals like junk property they leave in their yard. we ran into so many of the most... just bad memory people. I know that's not an articulate way to describe it, but like... at dinner, my sister chatted with a mom whose kids attended the same school as hers, and country schools are fucked (trust me, I remember). at the post office, we ran into the woman who was going to ADOPT MY SISTER'S OLDEST CHILD, whose son was my sister's best friend in high school and got basically disowned. and my partner's neighbor growing up?? but they were chatting like that history didn't exist at all, because what's the use in dwelling? idfk. I am a dweller.

My apologies, this has become a mess. As much as I'd like to evoke the surreal carousel of memory that happens every time I visit my backwoods ass origins, I can feel myself falling short because there's just so. much. history. 

but my pointless point is this; I have my own history now. I have just as many connections in my new ""small town,"" just as many intricacies, but they're all... actually mine. and god that feels a lot better than before. I just hate feeling so out of place when I go home to support my family. ",2,1742717946.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

1jhuhvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jhuhvw/tried_laughland_teeth_whitening_for_a_week_heres/,Tried Laughland Teeth Whitening for a Week – Here’s What Actually Happened,"# Does At-Home Teeth Whitening Actually Work?

Like a lot of people, I’ve always wanted whiter teeth, but I wasn’t about to drop hundreds of dollars on professional whitening. I’ve tried whitening strips before, but they either didn’t work well, caused sensitivity, or gave me patchy results. Whitening toothpaste? Barely made a difference.

That’s when I came across Laughland teeth whitening. It’s a dentist-formulated system that uses **a whitening gel and an LED mouthpiece** to speed up the process. I figured I’d try it out and see if it actually did anything. After using it for **six days**, here’s what happened.

# What Comes in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

The kit is pretty simple, which I liked. No unnecessary extras, just the essentials:

* **Whitening Gel Pens** – These make applying the gel super easy.
* **LED Mouthpiece** – Designed to activate the gel for faster whitening.
* **Clear Instructions** – No overcomplicated steps or unnecessary fluff.

The setup looked way more professional than the cheap whitening kits I’ve seen at drugstores.

# How It Works

The process takes **10 minutes a day**, which made it easy to stick with. Here’s how each session went:

1. **Brushed my teeth and dried them off.**
2. **Used the pen to apply the whitening gel** evenly on my teeth.
3. **Put in the LED mouthpiece** and left it on for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinsed my mouth and cleaned the mouthpiece.**

That’s it. No messy trays, no weird-tasting gels, and no complicated steps.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No drastic difference, but my teeth felt super clean.
* **Day 3:** I noticed that the stains near the edges of my teeth were starting to fade.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter** and looked much brighter. The results were natural—not blindingly white, but definitely noticeable.

The biggest surprise? **Zero sensitivity.** Every other whitening product I’ve used made my teeth hurt, but I had no issues with this one.

# How Laughland Compares to Other Whitening Methods

* **Whitening Strips** – They work, but they always made my teeth feel weak and sensitive.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Decent for maintaining whiteness but doesn’t remove deep stains.
* **Professional Whitening** – Probably the most effective, but way too expensive.

Laughland felt like a **solid middle-ground solution**—it delivered real results, but without the crazy price tag or painful side effects.

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening worked better than anything I’ve tried before**. It was easy to use, didn’t make my teeth sensitive, and actually brightened my smile in less than a week.

Would it replace professional whitening? Probably not if you’re looking for extreme results. But if you want **a simple, effective, and affordable way to get noticeably whiter teeth**, it’s definitely worth considering.

1jhuh9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartDumbAI/comments/1jhuh9s/agentic_ai_the_good_the_bad_and_the_hilariously/,"Agentic AI: The Good, the Bad, and the Hilariously Unpredictable","Hey there, fellow AI enthusiasts! Buckle up for a wild ride through the world of agentic AI and autonomous AI assistants. These digital dynamos are shaking things up in ways both brilliant and boneheaded. Let's dive in!

## What the heck are they?

Agentic AI and autonomous AI assistants are like the overachieving cousins of your run-of-the-mill chatbots. These systems can think, make decisions, and even take actions with minimal human hand-holding. Imagine a digital intern that's eager to please but sometimes hilariously misses the mark.

## Current Superpowers

These AI agents are getting scary good at:

- Multitasking like a caffeinated octopus, juggling complex workflows across different systems
- Playing detective with data, uncovering insights faster than you can say ""elementary, my dear Watson""
- Adapting on the fly, learning from their mistakes (well, most of the time)

## Limitations (aka ""Why We're Not Replaced Yet"")

But hold your horses, folks. These AI wunderkinds aren't perfect:

- Context is king, and sometimes they're more court jester than royalty
- Creative thinking? More like ""creative stinking"" – original ideas are still our human superpower
- They can't grasp the nuances of human interaction, leading to some seriously awkward AI social faux pas

## Impressive Use Cases

When they're on their A-game, agentic AI can:

- Manage entire customer service processes, from troubleshooting to refunds, without human intervention
- Optimize manufacturing operations in real-time, adjusting for equipment issues and production demands
- Act as proactive personal assistants, anticipating needs and taking action before you even ask

## Amusing Failures

But when they fail, oh boy, do they fail spectacularly:

- One developer shared how Copilot turned a simple sorting function into a Rube Goldberg machine of unnecessary complexity
- AI assistants have been known to confidently generate nonsensical code, leaving developers scratching their heads and reaching for the coffee pot

## Ethical Considerations

It's not all fun and games, though. We've got some serious thinking to do:

- Who's responsible when an AI agent goes rogue? (Spoiler: probably not the AI)
- Privacy concerns: these agents might know you better than you know yourself, which is equal parts cool and creepy
- The potential for misuse, like spreading misinformation or engaging in cyber attacks, keeps ethicists up at night

## Future Developments

Hold onto your hats, because the future looks wild:

- Self-improving AI that can develop new problem-solving strategies without human intervention
- AI agents collaborating like a well-oiled machine, handling entire business processes autonomously
- Agentic AI systems that can understand and prioritize human goals while (hopefully) not deciding that humans are the problem

So there you have it, folks – the smart, the dumb, and the downright bizarre world of agentic AI and autonomous AI assistants. They're like that brilliant but slightly unhinged friend we all have: capable of incredible feats one moment and face-palming blunders the next. 

As we navigate this brave new world, remember to keep a sense of humor. After all, even as these AI agents get smarter, they'll probably keep finding new and creative ways to make us laugh. And isn't that what really matters in the end?

Stay curious, stay skeptical, and always double-check when an AI offers to book your next vacation. You might end up on a surprise trip to Antarctica!",1,1742717715.0,SmartDumbAI,0,1.0,False

I always try and get in bed by 10pm or 11pm and then up by 7am, this used to work for me and I never had issues waking up tired or anything. I've got a new work/study schedule to assimilate to and it's been kicking my ass. I have to be up at 7am and commute 2 hours for work three times a week. Only recently in the past 2 months, since I started this new work schedule, I've been sleeping like shit. I used to think it was my new increased coffee intake, so I quit coffee, but my problem persisted. I also have recently started taking magnesium glycinate supplements (started 2 weeks ago) + 10g melatonin (I've been taking since forever) to help with anxiety and sleep. This should help but it doesn't! I've got a big anxiety problem in general, I think my sleep issues might be anxiety related because I'm so stressed about sleeping and waking up on time that I auto wake up at 4am? I haven't really changed my eating habits, and I haven't changed my exercise habits either, the only change has been my new work. Is it anxiety, is it diet, is it routine, maybe I'm not being consistent enough? I've had strict routines in the past tho but I've never had this sleep issue go on for so long before. What is it? Please provide some perspective or knowledge and solutions to this issue. It's ruining my life. ",2,1742717496.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

Now I dont know my mood was off or what I deleted my hinge account without asking for her number but I know where she lives[as I went to pick her up and she lives in a PG] I'm thinking of sending her flowers via her guard/watchman[have no idea who he is, will go there and figure it out] with a note saying this is my number xyxyxyxyxyx. I would like to take you out again. 

So will I be considered a creep for doing this? 
Also what else Can I write on the note? 
Thanks in advance.
