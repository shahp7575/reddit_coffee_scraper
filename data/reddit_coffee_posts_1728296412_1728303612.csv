I‚Äôm an Indian expat(F, 30) who‚Äôs been navigating the streets of Paris for the past two years‚Äîstill figuring out the metro system! I‚Äôm currently learning French (which is a fancy way of saying I can order a croissant and have small talk level is all)

**A little about me:** I enjoy running, weightlifting, and reading‚Äîbasically, I‚Äôm trying to be fit enough to keep up with all the cheese and pastries! As a vegetarian(not vegan; I eat all the cheese and milk based products and take no issue at all with your food choices), I‚Äôm on the hunt for the best plant-based restaurants. If you know any places with good  and pocket friendly falafel & Hummous, I‚Äôll be your best friend.

If you‚Äôre up for a run, a gym session, or just want to share some laughs over coffee (or wine, I don‚Äôt judge), hit me up! Looking forward to making some new friends in this amazing city!

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


#### **1. The Clamps - From Dust To Dawn [Kosenprod]**  
*Recommended if you like: Opsen, Burr Oak, First Person*  

How does he do it?! 

Just last year, we did one of our [diligently detailed deep dives](https://redd.it/131osxs/) into the collaborative long player he crafted with his best mate Nicolas _Opsen_ Levy under their _Burr Oak_ alias, and roughly 18 months later, we're already back talking about **Julien Carbou** and his newest 17-track (!) strong solo album as **The Clamps**! And it's not like the Frenchman wasn't busy in the meantime either. Just in this timeframe, we've got remixes for _First Person_, _A.M.C_, _Mean Teeth_ and _Wiguez_, a collaboration with _A.way_ on _Sinful Maze_ and solo stomper _Conviction_ on _Code Smell_, but that's still just the solo stuff! On the Burr Oak side of things, we've had outstanding crossover teamwork bangers with _Pythius_, _Magnetude_, _Audio_ and _Redpill_, remixes for _Neonlight_, _Task Horizon_ and _Redpill_ & _Black Sun Empire_, and hardcore-influenced one-off pounders _Ground & Pound_ and _J'laisse Des Traces (J'Pars En Vrille)_. However, we've still not covered everything this most productive member of our scene had to offer musically - he also started his own Hard Techno alias **All For Us**, with one freebeast of a tune and two brutal slammers on _Broken Strain_. 

Not to forget all the touring he and Monsieur Levy have been doing as of late, with them unleashing the bulls‚Ñ¢Ô∏è at basically all the big festivals and clubs all over the European continent and, as of this week, Julien has even embarked on his first Australia tour! So let's see what he's got to offer on this newest one then, shall we?

By now, most members of the No Neuro No Party family will have grown fond of Julien's extraordinarily destructive brand of heaviness, and trust me, his newest long player **From Dust To Dawn** _delivers_ plenty to love on that front without losing that unique spark that sets him apart from the masses. Lead into the madhouse with the slowly unraveling, massively vibe-setting title track, we're not just treated to planet-destroying steamrollers like the journey through ominous heaviness that is **Where Secrets Lie**, the vocal-chop-filled dramatic reenactment of hell raining down on earth that is **Faith**, the city-, nay country-flattening yet melodically wonderful **Inflate**, and the _gnarly_ bison stampede **Let Me Know (Where You Go)**, i.e. the type of tunes you might expect from a Neurofunk album by one of the greats, no no, all sorts of other vibes are very much present and accounted for as well!

For instance, we've got the techy-leaning bangers like the hardcore-hammering, woodpecker-stabbering, earthquake-causing adventure through auditory space **Blumhouse** with returning collaborator **Tryst Temps** and the whirlwind of cries of agony, continous bass bombing and increasingly heavy tensions that is the anti-stupidity anthem **Dummies**, while still not falling short of the heavy tunes putting the _funk_ into Neurofunk, like the stabbilicuous four-to-the-fleur turning into a full-on bouquet of heaviness that is **Feeling Lost**, the frankly ridiculously catchily flowing straight-up banger **Click Clack**, the bass-walls manufacturing headnodder **Snakes & Cowards** with a touch Reggae-esque inspirations on the vocal front, the slowly but surely evolving madness of epic vocals, 4x4 pounding and elephantesque bass explosions of **Seven Virtues**, and the machine that takes you from grandiose instrumentalisations into a never-ending battle between ear-destroying one-two-punch howls and rhythmically intricate techiness and back again, also known as **The Bill**. 

Of course, Julien is flexing his (Juli)endlessly creative production all over these tunes, but on none are they more pronounced than on the elaborately constructed union of heavy and vibey, the psychological horror in audio form that is **Les Autres**, the intergalactic voyage alongside otherworldly beings from a dying star pushing both the drum action and every single synth past the point of no return that is **Veilwhisper**, the marvellously atmospheric body- and mind-shaker destined to rattle everyone who listens to it to their very core that is **Moirai**, and the at first almost relaxing yet incredibly detailed vibe eventually snowballing into this _avalanche_ of synthtastic, filthy sound design magic that is **Snowfall** with fantastic fellow Frenchie **Eluun**. 

However, my favourite has got to be album closer **Story's Left Untold**. Not only is it a surprisingly melodic take on the genre that is usually so much about the big fuck-off reaction, as a tribute to his beloved cat _Ponyo_ that sadly left him all too soon earlier this year, it's also oozing with honest-to-god heartbreaking emotion that never fails to overwhelm the cat lover in me. At first I genuinely thought it was just a sweet little tune sampling his cute lovely cat purring and meowing, but the more I paid attention to the poignant lyrics once again so wonderfully performed by Julien himself, the more the crippling grief, the depressing emptiness of the sleep- and endless days, and the sheer _emotions_ of it all became clear, to the point where I couldn't help but bawl my eyes out. Rest In Peace, Ponyo. 

As insanely bassface-causing in its world-class production as it is diverse in its excellently creative worldbuilding and heartfelt songwriting from the man himself. A truly outstanding body of work. Absolutely up there with the best albums of this year, and we've had quite the year!

#### **2. Audioscribe - Infinite Spaces EP [Pilot]**  
*Recommended if you like: Hybrid Minds, SiLi, Capturelight*  

After all these loud noises, I think we should settle down a little, with some lushness, courtesy of one of America's finest producers in the genre: **Audioscribe**! 

Keen brains will remember that we've featured this auditory record keeper, named _Dylan Hardy_, [back in 2022 for his _REAPER_ remix already](https://redd.it/x0nkag), but frankly, there was so much missing from the Salt Lakeian's backstory that I cannot help but expand on it a little. For instance, I never mentioned that it was his dad that instilled his love for rock, and by extension the guitar, into him from an early age! Following that, he tried his hand at playing in bands, but as time went on, and as his spinal muscular atrophy worsened, that became harder and harder, leading to the eventually wheelchair-bound teenage Dylan to pursue production instead. Somewhere along the process, in 2011, his good mate _Capturelight_ showed him _Liquicity_, kicking off a long-lasting love for the sound pushed by the blossoming YouTube channel. Two years later, at only 15 years of age (!), he not only started uploading various different sonic experiments with _Synx_ as well as _Capturelight_ under the **Audioscribe** alias already, he would also drop his very first label release, _Skyline_ on _NoCopyrightSounds_, followed by _Free Fall_ the next year. 

However, aside from that, 2014 would also mark the start of his hiatus from the newly established moniker, with him drifting into all sorts of Electronic, Trap and Soundtrack-y vibes production-wise, while his own musical diet consisted of Post-Rock, Shoegaze and the likes. He didn't just keep these things to himself though, he created a whole 'nother side project for this kind of stuff, called **Dylan Hardy**! As well as branching out sonically, he also decided to get back into the guitar he loved so much growing up, and by 2018, he was ready to get back into all things _Audioscribe_, to weave all the things he learned during this time into the Liquid DnB he was still so obsessed with. More specifically, together with his mates _Boxplot_ and _Justin Hawkes_, on the blindingly lovely _Sunroad_ on _Liquicity_, the channel that basically started it all! Over the next two years or so, he polished his skills further and further, finally kicking off a real _spree_ of loveliness in 2020: a return to _NCS_ with _Shimmer_, the anthem that is _Hymn_ with _Justin Hawkes_ and his very own solo outing, _Letting Go_, on UKF's _Pilot_. 

Further and further, Dylan burrowed himself into the scene at large, with more and more releases on _Pilot_, _Hospital_, _Liquicity_, Wilkinson's _Sleepless_, _Space Yacht_, _Bassrush_, and even _Deadbeats_, working together with _Fred V_ and _Boxplot_, remixing _REAPER_ and _Pirapus_, and playing some rather huge shows across the American continent. 

Now, he returns to his home imprint **Pilot** to once again take flight with four truly _wonderful_ anthems, on his **Infinite Spaces EP**! If you want know why I'm so hyped about this particular return, just listen to EP opener **Codeswitch**, with Elkin's most excellent vocalist/lyricist/instrumentalist **Dylan Longworth** on the _gorgeous_ vocals. Not only is vocal-Dylan absolutely _killing_ it in his department, producer-Dylan is also bringing his absolute A-game, consisting of truly heartwarming synths, a wonderful drumwork smoothie and a blanket of bass that'll keep you cozy on even the coldest days of Autumn. The cuddly vibes continue with **Okay Tomorrow** - big, distant drums, a cute little vocal sample and _lovely_ Hymn-esque synths are just the beginning! As the buildup composition is reaching its peak, Dylan pulls out the rug out from underneath us with a drop fake-out, through which he's bringing in some infectiously catchy synth flurries that will keep us company on this steppy headnodder vibe. 

For title track **Infinite Spaces**, the vibe pendulum swings back to the _liquid_ anthem side of things, with Manchester-based singer-songwriter **Kintsuku**'s vocal performance alone already taking listeners' ears to cloud nine, but it's the way Dylan works it into the arrangement that pushes it to the _stratosphere_. The delayed drop putting a spotlight on Kintsuku's titular _Spaceeees_, the lush, warm roller vibe that follows, the pianos all over the tune, that Halftime vibe in the second half, it's all just so wonderful! Just as we were starting to get comfy at the campfire of loveliness that is this EP, we have already reached the end, with the dreamy closer **Love Yourself**. Not only are we once again treated to a fantastic, life-affirming vocal sample, the arrangement of synthified choirs, rolling drums, guitar strums and even some record scratches, if my ears are not deceiving me, is simply gorgeous as well, rounding the project off perfectly.

_Sublimely_ vibey anthems that might well make you Audioscry.

1fy5xm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1fy5xm3/how_to_find_meaning_in_a_meaningless_life_post/,How to find meaning in a meaningless life / post uni burnout,"I'm almost 27 (female/non binary), living in Europe.

I have ADHD, chronic dysthymia, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, extreme noise sensitivity and am very prone to being overstimulated. I used to be vegan, very fit, optimistic, saying to myself that I will live long and run marathons at the age of 60. Somehow reality hit I guess. Maybe living in a big city and studying destroyed me. 

I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life and have lately been faced with that question again. I got a bachelor's degree in humanities, went to university abroad (a neighboring country), but moved back home with my parents to a small town in my last semester due to financial and mental health issues. I finished my bachelor paper from home while working at a small NGO in HR. This was the worst year of my life so far. I basically didn't have any social contact with anyone other than my parents and my 40+ year old small town collegues. Plus, I am very queer and was in an extremely conservative setting. 

After finishing my degree, I started looking for 'real' entry level jobs in bigger cities in order to be able to live on my own and have a life again. As finding a job turned out to be more difficult than I thought, I decided to just move to any city I like. I found a shared apartment, got unemployment benefits and started looking for a job from there. I soon found a part time position as a university secretary. I then recently found my own one bedroom apartment, which I consider a huge success. 

Writing this now, I feel like things don't sound as bad as they might seem to me. Still, I struggle getting out of bed in the morning. I struggle with money. I come from a lower middle class immigrant family with lots of mental health issues. I struggle with making decisions. Making friends. I feel exhausted most of the time. I am very addicted to social media (reels and YouTube). I am constantly questioning myself. I don't know what I live for. I don't want to become a mom and I don't really see myself having a 'career'. But I also don't have a creative passion, that some people pursue instead of a traditional path. I don't dress for the male gaze anymore, which used to be my anchor. Sadly, getting more and more pretty for male validation was what I liked doing in my free time. I don't take care of my looks anymore, although I would like to find a (non male) partner. Everything feels like too much of an effort. Even eating feels painful to me sometimes. I have periods of times, where I just drink coffee and rot in bed all day.

I guess I got severely burned out from studying and living in a big and loud city, finishing my bachelor's took me five years, as I have ADHD and had to work in order to finance myself. Maybe I'm not completely healed yet, one year after having finished my degree, but I pressure myself into figuring out my next steps. Am I going to work full time in order to be able to travel? Should I get a master's degree? Should I do unpaid internships and work as a barista? I am so sick of living on a budget and trying to achieve some kind of ideal of a career though. Looking back, I don't really do much with my time, but it feels like so much is happening inside of my brain. So many thoughts and emotions that distract me from taking actions and just living. 

I would like to take suggestions on how to keep moving forward. How to just do the things, even if you over intellectualize them and conclude that they might be useless. How to just get up and eat breakfast without it hurting so badly. How do I find meaning in a meaningless life?

(I am on antidepressants)

1fy5u21,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fy5u21/why_do_men_say_romantic_feelings_always_missing/,Why do men say romantic feelings always missing for me? (27F talking to 25M),"I was talking with this guy for one year now‚Ä¶ We were classmates and at first we were just messaging casually back and forth but then the communication became more consistent and we started calling each other and talking for an hour + every few days. He would be flirty and call me beautiful and always offer to buy me snacks at school. This continued for a couple of months and then he suggested we go get coffee/tea. At this point I was really interested in dating him so I took him up on the offer and we went for tea and had a great time. While we were out for tea I was mentioning us dating as I thought that this was a given (and that we were on a date). I even was talking about referring to him as my boyfriend given the amount of time that we had been talking and he laughed and seemed to have no problem with it. Then I didn‚Äôt hear from him for a week afterwards which I thought was strange. I call him and ask him what‚Äôs been going on and point blank if the situation is romantic for him. He stuns me by saying the situation was never romantic for him and he‚Äôs not attracted to me but thinks we should stay platonic friends ‚Äúfor now.‚Äù¬†

I am devastated but we wind up becoming even closer over the next few months and our calls turn in to 2-4 hours at night once or twice per week‚Ä¶ When we do go out to run errands together he is crazy protective of me and gets concerned if I don‚Äôt text him when I arrive home safely. He starts calling me multiple times a week and remains consistent for months, even calling when he is on family vacation. He jokes about playing the ‚Äúlong game‚Äù with me and I start to believe that maybe he has changed his mind or was afraid and is now really opening up into the relationship. Eventually he invites me out for tea/coffee again and we go and things go great, but then he is quiet for a week just like the original time (which at this point was 6 months ago). I get concerned but my anxiety is assuaged by him deciding to swing by my apartment to pick me up so we can spend a day together in the city. We have the most amazing time and he even brings me a little gift and is always offering to buy me whatever I want when we are out. Everything feels perfect and things feel great until we get into a deeper conversation a couple of weeks later and I tell him that I have been a bit confused since our last conversation about feelings many months ago because it feels like we are together in a romantic sense now. He stuns me once more by saying it is still not romantic and this time says he doesn‚Äôt think it will ever be for him.¬†

I‚Äôm so confused because he is so dedicated to knowing me and caring for me and is consistently wanting to talk to me on the phone. This is a strange situation because I feel loved through his actions but he insists that this is not the case. I'm just so upset because I love him so much and he‚Äôs my best friend so the fact that he insists there is something missing romantically for him is devastating and I don‚Äôt know what to do.¬†I have never wanted to marry anyone before I met him and now I feel like I never will since he has set such an incredibly high standard.

**TLDR: I have never felt more seen and loved and protected by a man in my entire life (27F) and my heart is shattered because even though it feels like we are dating and he is so interested (and I really believe attracted) to me, he insists that there is nothing there romantically and never will be. This has happened before in my life with a guy best friend I was also in love with right before I met this guy. I asked my friend what was missing for this situation to be romantic and he said he couldn‚Äôt figure out why the feeling wasn‚Äôt there. I‚Äôm really miserable because at this point I feel like I keep falling in love with men who really seem to adore me, then tell me that the romantic aspect is missing. I know it‚Äôs a tough question but is there any advice any men have for me here as to what I might be missing? I‚Äôve always been considered attractive and get along great with all types of guys. For some reason the guys I connect with deeply and really bond with don‚Äôt consider me romantically (and it also seems these guys only consider girls they aren't close to in a romantic sense). I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm searching for but maybe there is something obvious that is missing because I‚Äôm 27F and there is no reason I shouldn‚Äôt have had at least one or two relationships by now with the amount of attention I have always received from guys. I understand that I am a bit picky with the guys I choose to entertain but why is it that my closest relationships with men are never able to be romantic from their end?**",2,1728302309.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I am quite the heavy sleeper. There were periods in my life, however, when I would sleep a lot more than usual and the waking up process was even more difficult or even impossible. I had a job for a short while, but I was doing relatively ok sleep-wise. I would go to bed early and no other issues. Shortly put, whenever I had periods of sleep issues like this one currently (which is the worst of all) I would get my blood tests done and NOTHING would ever appear as wrong. I even had a sleep study done and everything is fine: ""you just need to sleep at 10 PM"". I checked up my thyroid long time ago and again, no problems. I am typing out everything that I've tried, maybe I have to check up my thyroid again? I have been drinking 4 liters of water for a few years ago and I have no diabetes, I dont know man, I just wish I had an answer! So, yeah, im drinking more than enough water. Im eating really healthy and no symptoms for anemia except for tiredness and no symptoms either for magnesium deficiency, however, I have also heard that lots of people are deficient and that we need more magnesium because we dont absorb all of it. For a few weeks I have sprayed magnesium 100 mg on my feet and no, I still wake up like a train wreck.
Sorry for the long text, but I feel like whenever I'm in a situation like this one nothing helps me, I suffer for a few months and then the problem vanishes and I can wake up normally again. Doctors tell me I am really healthy, so I dont know. Since June I had my summer vacation and before that I would go to bed at 10 PM and wake up at 5 AM for uni, I felt like a champ, this never happened before and I would have lots of energy. No, I didnt do anything that I dont do now and my meals are the same. I exercise from time to time just like then. I am not depressed, I beat my depression long time ago. My room is clean, refreshed, window open, I even use nasal strips because I read somewhere that it helps, but no, im still waking up like a zombie.
Please, tell me what I can do. Which doctor to go to who can find out my problems. Which tests need to be done.
And also, I dont know if it's very relevant, but since June I have started smoking again and I drink 2 cups of coffee a day, usually, the second one I drink it in the evening. Maybe this could cause my fatigue? Never have I felt that coffee gives my energy, I would sleep just fine even if I drank coffee at 9 PM. However, now I'm wondering if it can give you fatigue if you drink it late in the evening.

I recently spent a week out of town for work, so i decided to fly my girlfriend out for the weekend. When I picked her up from the airport, I noticed she was wearing dark lip gloss for the first time in our five-year relationship. The following morning, she gave me oral sex before we had intercourse. Throughout the day, she kept reapplying the lip gloss, and I thought it was just a new style she was trying out.

During dinner, I noticed her lip gloss was fading, and to my shock, she had her first ever cold sore at 29 years old. I wouldn't have even had a second thought about it as they're so common, except what we did earlier that day, including her drinking my water and coffees like an average day for us.

She insists that she wasn't trying to hide it from me and purposly transfer it to me, and claims she didn‚Äôt have it when we were intimate in the morning. But even if that‚Äôs true, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling of unease about her drinking from my water and sharing coffee with me after it appeared later in the evening when she claims she discovered it. 

Now, I‚Äôm left with some pressing questions: Is she being truthful that the cold sore appeared within just five hours without her knowing? Could she have contracted it four days earlier, as she was acting strangely that day and not responding to my calls, etc. I know that I am likely going to have an outbreak soon. I just dont know enough about it, and it's stuck on my mind. My main concern is the waiting game to see if I'm going to get a cold sore everywhere she touched her with her infected area, or could I just get one sore on a random apot there?

firstly, this is potentially a very bad idea. if you're a minor or don't take shifting seriously - this is your warning to not read it or consider doing it very carefully please because I wanna share my thoughts but I don't wanna be responsible for whatever decision you may make.

so, as we all know shifting is connecting to your dr self, that's what all those methods/meditations and stuff are for - to help you to connect to your dr, right? and, to put it shortly, my mental health has been crap for the last year mostly, and it's getting either much worse or better lately too. I'm 22, and no improvement currently.

so my thoughts were to put myself in a bad place in shifting so my cr mindset would align with my dr self current thought process. I'm permashifting to my mha dr, I'm 15 there, have a great family, life, starting UA soon, and everything is just so perfect I couldn't ask for more, but with me being depressed so badly here makes it hard for me to connect to my dr. it's been almost 2 years of trying with no results whatsoever. so, I decided to change my script a tiny bit and let's say, script I got kidnapped. 

and before you throw tomatoes at me please hear me out. firstly, I scripted the world isn't nearly as cruel as our cr, I have a very detailed script with all that thought out. hence grapes/trafficking and child p, many stuff like that do not exist, child r isn't even a thing, and etc. no beating either, no nothing, just quirk suppressing cuffs, food and a room (like what eri had). secondly, I'm gonna script there won't be anything crazy or really harmful for me and I will be rescued soon. I have a healing quirk (for the most part) in my dr so I'm thinking the villains will just try to do the same shit as with eri (who has a good life in my dr and have never been used for experiments ofc) and make instant healing pills or smth like that to sell later for a huge amount of money. like, doesn't seem like any damage or harm to civilians or society (unless it's used for prolonged tortures...? ü§î ...I'll script that out). I thought it might be extremely valuable for example for other villains who can't for obvious reasons go to the hospital and with how rare healing quirks are? idk. 

this all is to be able to let my thoughts finally flow freely and not force myself into a good mindset that I can't reach. I just think it could make connecting to my dr so much easier. like when I feel so desperate to leave, desperate to see my (dr) family - I wouldn't have to stop myself anymore and try to force myself to think stuff like 'wait I'm already in my dr, my dad is literally in the kitchen making coffee, silly' NO, forcing myself into better mindset like that only makes me feel more desperate and makes me cry more. but this way i could finally relax (somewhat) and don't pretend everything is fine. does it make sense?

most nights i can't even force myself to try to shift just because my dr is so perfect and I love it sm, but here, in my cr, i just couldn't for the life of mine make myself think more positively so.... yeah

and! scripting I'm a master shifter ofc. because if anything goes wrong, I wanna remind myself and everyone else who might be reading and considering this idea - you can always shift from there to somewhere else and if it was a terrible experience - shift somewhere else after scripting you'll forget that happened. like, a plan B. just in case.",1,1728301628.0,shiftingrealities,0,1.0,False
1fy5m8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1fy5m8t/customers/,Customers. ,"I‚Äôm a barista. I love my job, my coworkers, my managers and most of the customers. But what really ruins the job for me is some of the really awful customers who think it‚Äôs okay to basically bully a 19 year old girl (me). Like are you okay? Who hurt you? And why am I being screamed at for literally doing my job? 

For some context before I get into some examples, the place where I work at we have 2 different types of coffee roasts. We have our house roast which is just the standard, and we have our ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù roast which changes every few months and it costs an extra 30p since it costs us more to buy it. We also have to ask quite a lot of questions when someone asks for a drink such as medium or large, what type of roast, if they‚Äôre sitting in or taking out, etc etc. WE DO THIS TO MAKE SURE WE GET THEIR ORDER 100% CORRECT!

Okay onto an example. I honestly want ur guys opinions on this

Me: Hello! What can I get for you today?

Customer: Just a coffee please.  

M: Okay! What kind of coffee would you be after? We have a large range of lovely options so I‚Äôd need to know what specific kind. 

C: I don‚Äôt know. Just a normal coffee. 

M: Well do you like milky coffees? Strong coffees? Weak coffees? 

C: Just the filter coffee kind. 

M: Oh I see! Well unfortunately we don‚Äôt do filter coffees here, but we do americanos which is still your standard coffee shot with water. Should I put this one through for you? 

C: Yeah I suppose so. 

M: Perfect! Would you like our house or seasonal roast with your coffee? (Pointing to the board that explains the differences in taste and price)

C: (reads the board) I‚Äôll have the seasonal. 

M: Perfect! Your total today will be ¬£4.65. 

C: WHAT?? Why is my total ¬£4.65?? My usual coffee only costs ¬£4.35!!!

M: it‚Äôs because you chose the seasonal roast, it does actually cost an extra 30p since it costs us more to buy. It does explain it on the board, but if you want the house roast which is cheaper I‚Äôd be more than happy to change this on the till for you. 

And after that she starts screaming at me telling me I‚Äôm trying to scam and overcharge her? ARE YOU BLIND?

The amount of people that have started shouting and calling me names over me getting their order wrong is ridiculous. Like it will literally take me 2 seconds to either fix your order for you or refund you entirely. I understand it‚Äôs frustrating not getting what you asked for but we‚Äôre human too, we make mistakes, we have bad days, we get tired and make silly errors, and when someone starts belittling you it makes my whole day so much worse. 

And these people are usually middle aged men/ women who should know better. Honestly the nicest people I‚Äôve ever met working in a cafe have been younger customers, and the older people have the AUDACITY to call the youth of today ‚Äúrude and disrespectful‚Äù when it‚Äôs actually so much the other way round. 

I only gave one example but honestly so many more things like this and worse have happened to me, literally just for trying to do my best and accommodate them. Especially when they‚Äôre talking SO quietly and I keep having to ask them to repeat what they‚Äôre saying and they get mad cause I can‚Äôt hear them.

1fy5lg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1fy5lg6/lucid_dreaming/,Lucid Dreaming ,"(This is a fictional horror story and there's some arguably self-harm content in there so you've been warned)

I‚Äôve never been particularly good at anything. You know that feeling you get when you try something new and it just ‚Äòclicks‚Äô, everything makes sense, you‚Äôve got a real knack for it? Yeah, I‚Äôve never really had that feeling. I‚Äôm unathletic, painfully average in my studies, not great at music or making friends or getting girls, nothing.¬†



If you‚Äôre sharp, or, I guess, nitpicky, you‚Äôll be asking yourself ‚Äúhow does he know what it feels like to be a natural at something if he‚Äôs never experienced it?‚Äù Well, because for once in my life, three weeks ago, I finally did. It was so wonderful, I was elated. Now, though, I wish I never had that feeling. I wish I‚Äôd stayed in ignorance, blissful, blissful ignorance, I wouldn‚Äôt be cursed with knowing what I now know.¬†



Anyway, I should explain before I get carried away.¬†



Monday three weeks ago, I walk to school like it‚Äôs any old day. I‚Äôm struggling because I‚Äôve been up playing playstation until 2 am as usual, so the lights are on upstairs but nobody‚Äôs home. I trudge into class and take some half-hearted notes, stare a bit at Elle Lamonte in front of me, when my friend, Ari, taps me on the shoulder and begins the conversation that will seal my fate. After seeing the bags under my eyes and recoiling a little, telling me I need to get more sleep, he says he read something interesting online: ‚ÄúJamie, you‚Äôve gotta try this,‚Äù he insists. He tells me that with a bit of practice and awareness, a normal person can experience *lucid dreaming*, which I‚Äôd always thought was some sci-fi thing, but he promises me it‚Äôs real, anybody can learn to ‚Äòwake up‚Äô inside their own dream, and do whatever they want. He tells me he‚Äôs not great at it yet, but he‚Äôs managed it once or twice. Not full awareness, he says. He realises he‚Äôs dreaming, but part of his brain is still sleeping, so he‚Äôs not really thinking logically or in any complex way, but still, he says the experience is really cool.



I take it with a grain of salt, to be honest. Ari has been known to tell a few tall tales, so my hopes aren‚Äôt particularly high, but still, I figure there‚Äôs no harm in looking it up when I get home that afternoon. My initial searches show me that there may have been truth to Ari‚Äôs words after all. I read up on some basic techniques, how to check if you‚Äôre in a dream, that you should never make the *assumption* that you‚Äôre in reality. I check if there are any serious risks, which apparently exist, but are rare. Sleep paralysis sounds kind of scary, and a few people complain of irritating headaches for a few days after they lucid dream, but I don‚Äôt come across anything too horrendous.¬†



Anyway, the websites all say not to expect results too quickly, and it‚Äôs a slow burn, so I rush through my homework, eat dinner and play playstation for a few hours before heading off to bed at 9, which my mum does think is a bit weird, but she doesn‚Äôt question it, just happy to see me getting a decent sleep for once, I guess.¬†



I know it said not to get my hopes up, but I admit, I did. Before long, I drift off to sleep, and then it happens.¬†



As if from nowhere, I awake. I‚Äôm at home, playing playstation like usual, but even without doing any tests or checks, I realise it: I‚Äôm in a dream.¬†



¬†I remember what Ari told me, and what I had read online: that it takes time to gain proper awareness in a lucid dream; at first it‚Äôs a sluggish train of thought, struggling against the brain‚Äôs natural inclination to shut itself down while asleep. I feel nothing like that, though. I feel incredible, more awake than when I‚Äôm *actually* awake. I look at my hand and marvel: my vision is crystal clear, my movements smooth and fluid, I stand up, feel infinite possibilities course through me and smile uncontrollably.



Remember that feeling I talked about? Of being a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù? Well, this was it. I knew this was finally it, something I was genuinely *amazing* at. I had full control of my dream. I snapped my fingers and my dingy room was at once replaced with a gorgeous sparkling beach, pearl-white sand and aquamarine ocean stretching out to the horizon. A banquet sprung up before me, covered in fried chicken, bacon-and-egg sandwiches, everything I could ever want. I looked behind me and there she was: Elle from class.¬†



Clad in a black two-piece that contrasted starkly to her seashell-pale skin, she grinned and pulled me into an embrace, closing her wonderful round, blue eyes wordlessly and kissed me.¬†



It was exactly how I had imagined it. Well, perhaps owing to the fact that I *was* imagining it, but still, it was so *visceral,* so *real.* I could feel her warmth, hear her voice exactly as she sounded in real life, it was uncanny.¬†



I pushed her away for a moment, smiling slyly, and conjured up with a mere notion, Richard Wrenn. I haven‚Äôt mentioned Richard until now because, well, he‚Äôs fundamentally quite unimportant, but just trust me on this: he‚Äôs a dick. And so, I took great satisfaction in directing him to stand ten metres from me, levelling my arm at him, and transforming my arm into a plasma cannon that proceeded to blast a two-foot-diameter hole in his torso. You might think this was a little cruel, and yes, maybe it was, but it wasn‚Äôt like he was *real*. He was just in my imagination. If he‚Äôd made me suffer a whole bunch in real life, I figured a little dream revenge that couldn‚Äôt actually hurt him wasn‚Äôt so bad in return.¬†



After watching him suffer for a moment, I vanished his burning corpse, and returned to my banquet, and to Elle.



I won‚Äôt bore you with the details of the next few hours, but just take this for my word: It was genuinely the most fun I‚Äôd ever had. Any wish that occurred to me, whatever I wanted, it was instantly granted.¬†



The only thing that bothered me was‚Ä¶ this little feeling. The best way I can describe it is: sometimes when I‚Äôm playing playstation and my mum isn‚Äôt home, I feel this sensation like she‚Äôs watching me from behind, and I turn around, even though I know she‚Äôs out and can‚Äôt possibly be there. It was a bit like that, like even though I was totally alone, like there were eyes burning into the back of my head.¬†



It was a little thing, though, and I only felt it briefly, once or twice, so I just ignored it. Eventually, I felt the dream start to fade as my sleep cycle naturally ended, and I woke up to a new day.¬†



It was an odd concoction of emotions: on one hand I felt incredibly well-rested. Most mornings I could barely drag myself out of bed, but today I felt revitalised, energetic, totally ready-to-do-it. I attributed this partly to actually getting a good night‚Äôs sleep for once, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that the lucid dream had something to do with it as well. Not only was it a great time, but it seemed to be like super-sleep, I was totally refreshed.¬†



Anyway, I walked to school more peppily than ever before, even having a little swagger in my step for a change. It felt odd seeing Elle in real life after my dream, but I played it cool and waved to her as I walked in, and to my surprise she gave me a big smile and waved back. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon for her to just blank me, so this was actually pretty big. It wasn‚Äôt making out on the beach, but still, a nice bonus to my already great morning.¬†



I couldn‚Äôt help but tell Ari how great I was doing, and how amazing my lucid dream was after I sat down beside him in class.¬†



‚ÄúWell, that makes one of us,‚Äù he grimaced back at me.¬†



He told me he‚Äôd had another sort-of half lucid dream last night, but now he had a splitting headache. I nodded and told him I‚Äôd read that could happen, he must‚Äôve got unlucky. He seemed kind of jealous when I told him how incredible my dream had been, but I think he wasn‚Äôt entirely sure I was telling the truth, which I thought was a bit rich coming from him.¬†



Anyway, the next few days were sort of a fuzzy blur. I won‚Äôt go through every little thing, but I‚Äôll give you the highlights. In short: they were awesome. Every night I had an amazing, full awareness lucid dream: I hung out with Ari, with Elle, feasted, explored the world and even the galaxy, it was genuinely too perfect to describe. In real life, too, I can‚Äôt fully explain it, but I think because I knew I could get whatever I wanted in my dream, I stopped worrying so much about the little things in day-to-day life, and so it all just flowed more easily. I was bursting with energy every day, I started talking to Elle for real, having lunch with her a couple of times. I even ran into Richard Wrenn in the corridor one day, and he just sort of winced and walked off without even hurling an insult at me! Everyone told me I was looking great, the bags under my eyes were gone, I even aced a maths test that I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd be lucky to escape with a C. It was all coming up roses.¬†



There were little niggles, though. That feeling‚Ä¶ The one of eyes burning into the back of my head, it didn‚Äôt really go away. Every night, I‚Äôd feel it for a little while, before it went away. I considered that I was imagining it, but part of me thought it stayed a little longer each night.¬†



I looked it up on the forums, but nobody else ever described anything like it. One thing I noticed, weirdly, though, was that a *lot* of people were complaining of severe headaches after lucid dreaming, just like Ari had. I searched old posts, and it turns out that these complaints had only started up in the past few months. At first, it was a few obscure mentions of mild headaches, but now there were multiple every day about real severe ones, so bad the people considered never trying to lucid dream again afterwards.¬†



I did think it was weird that the posts seemed to come out of nowhere in the past few months, but it wasn‚Äôt like it had anything to do with me. Even if I wanted to put my tinfoil hat on, the posts complaining about the headaches well pre-dated my starting to lucid dream, so it was impossible that they were related.¬†



Anyway, maybe a week after I started to lucid dream, something a little‚Ä¶ weird happened.¬†



I was chilling as always in dreamland, when just for a moment, everything faded to black, and I heard something.¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúArm the‚Ä¶ tachyon cannons.‚Äù¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúAre you sure, sir?‚Äô¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ doing them a favour. It‚Äôs for the best‚Ä¶ Do it.‚Äù



‚Ä¶



The voices had a strange cadence to them, and the words of the conversation were seared into my brain, I couldn‚Äôt have forgotten them if I tried.¬†



My dream world was back afterwards, only having been gone for a few seconds. It was a little disconcerting, to be sure, but normality returned soon afterwards, and I felt just as amazing as usual the next day.¬†



I chalked it up to an anomaly, maybe too many sci-fi video games kicking around in my thoughts. It was certainly a preferable side effect to the horrific headaches that kept popping up in the forums. I didn‚Äôt think much of it.¬†



At least, for the next few days.¬†



The forum posts about the headaches came with increasing frequency, but what *really* made me take notice was the next week, when I saw on tv: a news story. Several people had slipped into comas in their sleep, many were young and healthy, it was totally unexplained.¬†



I think I may have been the first to put two and two together when I realised: a very frequent poster on one of the lucid dreaming forums, a great helping hand to newcomers, out of nowhere, had simply vanished.¬†



Now, I‚Äôll admit, this scared me a bit. The risk of a headache was one thing, but a coma was another entirely. I considered trying to let the authorities know about what I‚Äôd noticed, but less than a day after I‚Äôd realised, they cottoned on, too. Official medical advice was issued across the globe: The medical causes were not entirely understood, but several people had lapsed into comas from which they had not awakened, due to lucid dreaming.¬†



Now I was properly frightened. I decided enough was enough. I‚Äôd had my fun, the dream world was fantastic, but it wasn‚Äôt worth the risk. Besides, my real life was going so great, I didn‚Äôt really need the dreams anymore anyway. Ari had been spooked by the news, but he and I were getting along great, and Elle and I had even hung out after school a few times, I was bucking up the courage to officially ask her out. Richard Wrenn hadn‚Äôt really shown his face, but my least favourite teacher, who I admit had appeared in my dream world a few times, had transferred schools a bit out of nowhere. I didn‚Äôt want to kill the golden goose, so I decided: I‚Äôd stop lucid dreaming, and focus on pressing my advantage in the real world.¬†



And, well, that should have been the end of it. I came to this decision about a week and a half ago. Goodbye, then, Jamie Aster signing out.



‚Ä¶¬†



Except, of course, it wasn‚Äôt that simple.¬†



When I went to bed that night, I woke up on that same wonderful beach. The sapphire waves, the fine, white sand. There was a totally different air to it now, though.¬†



I was aware. I was lucid.¬†



It was one thing to *choose* to lucid dream, it was another entirely to realise that the habit had become so ingrained that you couldn‚Äôt shake it.¬†



I shrugged my shoulders and figured, well, I did the crime, I might as well do the time, and so I had my fun.¬†



The mood was a bit dampened by the fact that I was honestly a bit scared that I‚Äôd slip into a coma and never wake up. That being-watched feeling hadn‚Äôt left, either. If anything, it was almost constant now, to the point that I was so used to it that I barely noticed it anymore.¬†



As per usual, though, the dream eventually faded, and I woke up in my bed, feeling fresh and new. I couldn‚Äôt help feeling, though, that the irrepressible energy coursing through me was just slightly less than it had been the previous day. I attributed it to the stress, and walked to school as usual.¬†



The next few days, things really started to get unsettling. Sorry if you‚Äôve been enjoying the feel-good mentions of daily school life, because you won‚Äôt be getting many anymore. Everyone was worried now. Dozens, then hundreds of people worldwide were slipping into comas, every day, and it wasn‚Äôt just lucid dreamers anymore. They‚Äôd go to sleep, perfectly healthy, and then never wake up. People everywhere went back and forth between talking and speculating endlessly in a paranoid state, and burying their heads in the sand and pretending it wasn‚Äôt happening.¬†



I didn‚Äôt know what felt worse: worrying myself sick over something I didn‚Äôt understand and couldn‚Äôt stop, or pretending it wasn‚Äôt happening and sleepwalking into my potential oblivion.¬†



That might sound a little melodramatic, but it‚Äôs true. Every day, thousands more fell¬† into comas, people panicked: it was all the news could talk about, mum came in and gave an increasingly forlorn and emotional ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù each evening.¬†



Elle even texted me before bed for the first time.¬†



‚Äú*Goodnight, Jamie. I‚Ä¶ hope I see you again at school tomorrow. I‚Äôll be honest. I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù*¬†



Again, I remember it word for word, because even as worried as I was, it still felt amazing to hear from her. I called her up to reassure her, then went to sleep as always.¬†



I‚Äôd put on a brave face for my mum, and for Elle, but as uneasy as my waking life had become, I think I still preferred it over what my nightly inevitable lucid dream had become.¬†



What had once been paradise had become purgatory: A flat world where I simply could not shake my own paranoia, my growing fear.¬†



Any attempt at escapism felt hollow and I simply could not, no matter how I tried, force myself to be even a little distracted. As a result, I simply existed passively in the dream, awaiting the moment it would finally fade with anticipation that grew with each passing night.¬†



Also aggregating with each subsequent dream was the general feeling of uneasiness, and even dread, that permeated the atmosphere of my own dream world. I found, as my own mental state deteriorated, so too did my ability to maintain a pleasant environment in my dreams.¬†



Each night, the beach, which had become my default dream setting, seemed to grow a little darker. The sand grew grimier, the water more turbid. At first I thought I was imagining it, but after a few days I stood under a stormy sky, on filthy¬† sand strewn with rubbish, beside water choked with debris and spiny seaweed.¬†



Four days ago. That‚Äôs when I fully realised it. The daily coma numbers had reached the tens of thousands. People were staying home from school. There was even talk of shutting them down. Everyone I knew was panicking. I could barely focus on my playstation, let alone my homework. I went from living in fear each day, to living a nightmare every time I closed my eyes. I still felt rested and rejuvenated each morning, but even that sensation was fading. It felt almost like a cruel joke at this point, like my body was at odds with the world around me.¬†



It was that night. Three sleeps ago. I sat, inert, inside my decaying dream purgatory. A few nights prior to this I would have been panicked, trying to stop the rot, but I was resigned at this point. I retreated further inside my head, suppressing my own awareness. I would wake soon, I thought. That would at least bring some release, even if it was only through a different sort of torment.¬†



As if it were a great bolt of lightning, striking a desolate stretch of silent, dead Earth, it appeared.¬†



Richard Wrenn flashed before me, and turned to face me.¬†



I realised, as soon as I gazed upon his visage, that these were the eyes that had been watching me, ever since my first lucid dream.¬†



I also realised that this was not simply Richard Wrenn. As soon as he entered my eyeline, as soon as his mental presence came within proximity of my own, I felt an overwhelming sense of panic overcome me. It was not ordinary fear. No, what I felt was akin to the sensation one feels when a bright torchlight is pressed against one‚Äôs eyelid. Even though the eye closes, and the body does everything it can to cope, it is simply powerless to repel the sheer force of the entity it is confronted with.¬†

My dream world felt as if it were a pea inside its pod, faced with a supermassive star forcing its way in. I screamed, and fell to the floor, managing to perceive, even as I clawed at my own eyes, Richard Wrenn smile grimly as I writhed in agony.¬†



‚ÄúQuail, feeble one, at the deliverance, in the form you so fear, of the World Eater.‚Äù¬†



Hearing it speak, in a voice that was certainly not Richard‚Äôs, assaulted my senses through their inability to comprehend it. The words made sense, but each syllable seemed somehow pregnant with meaning fathoms beyond my brain‚Äôs paltry capacity. It was this night that I truly came to realise the pettiness of my own existence, the inadequacy of my cognition and senses, the truly inconsequential nature of every action I had ever taken, every ambition I had ever possessed.¬†



As soon as he had arrived, he flashed once more and my dream world returned, although I had not.¬†



I remained on the tainted sand, hyperventilating, my mind struggling to form a coherent thought in the face of the firestorm with which it had been faced. It took hours for me to recover my senses, and when I did, I simply sat, knees pressed to my chest, and quivered with terror. That is how I wiled away my sentence that night. I am not certain how many hours I spent in the dream in that state, but when I woke, I was overjoyed.¬†



It superseded every joyful awakening sensation I had ever felt after a lucid dream. Every petty pleasure within the dream world, every previously treasured success in the real world, each one paled pathetically in comparison to the pure bliss of awakening shivering, cold, and in pain all over.¬†



Of rising to find blood dripping from my eyes, cold sweat oozing forth from every pore, shudders wracking my whole body. Every movement was ecstasy, simply for having escaped the dream world where I had faced that horror. The World Eater.¬†



Since then, it is difficult to describe my experience, difficult as the language developed by us human beings was intended to explain things that could reasonably happen in our lives. ‚ÄúSuffering‚Äù is viewed in the lens of suffering within normal human existence. As such, I cannot so easily describe the next two days: I lay, catatonic in my bed, bleeding from my eyes and from where my fingernails had scratched into my skin, for I scarcely felt even the slightest stimulation from waking pain anymore, and rather than attempting to scratch myself I merely failed to notice when my nails had rent open my flesh. I paid no heed to my mother‚Äôs concerns, nor to Elle or Ari‚Äôs texts or calls. I did not play my playstation, nor even consider going to school, I merely lay in bed quaking with fear until I inevitably could not force myself to stay awake any longer.¬†



My waking life was bliss compared to being tortured by the world eater during my sleep: subjected to a phantasmagoria of images beyond the furthest fathoms of my reckoning, and yet nonetheless capable of evoking unimaginable pain, terror, and despair in my mind, feeble as it was.¬†



The World Eater did not speak to me any further. It had no need to, I gleaned understanding of its thoughts through its ransacking the every entrail of my psyche. I felt its growing boredom with drawing the human race into an eternal oblivion of nightmare, and its ponderings on finding a new civilisation to annihilate. Its subtle glee at discovering the alien spacecraft that tracked it, and planned to annihilate Earth with tachyon weaponry to save us our eternal damnation, only to be conquered by the World Eater themselves, its mockery and disappointment at seeing humanity‚Äôs most gifted at control within the unconscious world utilise it for such petty reasons and activities. Most of the World Eater‚Äôs feelings towards Earth and humans were mere notions, he felt that they were inconsequential, but there was a severity to his resentment for me in particular, and this was made clear through my suffering, though only a normal night‚Äôs sleep in the real world, it seemed for all intents and purposes to me to last for countless aeons.¬†



There is almost relief now, as I lie awake writing this, slipping inevitably towards sleep, that this will be the final time. I know. Somehow I know. After I fall to the World Eater‚Äôs domain this time, I will never wake. I have managed to rise to drink as much coffee as I can stomach, I have blasted music in my ears, I have bitten the insides of my cheeks so hard I taste my metallic blood with every swallow. I can stave off sleep for no longer.¬† I can hope only that death will eventually claim me, and save me from the eternal nightmare.¬†



That is, if even death himself can supersede his grasp.¬†

1fy5ko0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1fy5ko0/lucid_dreaming/,Lucid Dreaming,"I‚Äôve never been particularly good at anything. You know that feeling you get when you try something new and it just ‚Äòclicks‚Äô, everything makes sense, you‚Äôve got a real knack for it? Yeah, I‚Äôve never really had that feeling. I‚Äôm unathletic, painfully average in my studies, not great at music or making friends or getting girls, nothing.¬†



If you‚Äôre sharp, or, I guess, nitpicky, you‚Äôll be asking yourself ‚Äúhow does he know what it feels like to be a natural at something if he‚Äôs never experienced it?‚Äù Well, because for once in my life, three weeks ago, I finally did. It was so wonderful, I was elated. Now, though, I wish I never had that feeling. I wish I‚Äôd stayed in ignorance, blissful, blissful ignorance, I wouldn‚Äôt be cursed with knowing what I now know.¬†



Anyway, I should explain before I get carried away.¬†



Monday three weeks ago, I walk to school like it‚Äôs any old day. I‚Äôm struggling because I‚Äôve been up playing playstation until 2 am as usual, so the lights are on upstairs but nobody‚Äôs home. I trudge into class and take some half-hearted notes, stare a bit at Elle Lamonte in front of me, when my friend, Ari, taps me on the shoulder and begins the conversation that will seal my fate. After seeing the bags under my eyes and recoiling a little, telling me I need to get more sleep, he says he read something interesting online: ‚ÄúJamie, you‚Äôve gotta try this,‚Äù he insists. He tells me that with a bit of practice and awareness, a normal person can experience *lucid dreaming*, which I‚Äôd always thought was some sci-fi thing, but he promises me it‚Äôs real, anybody can learn to ‚Äòwake up‚Äô inside their own dream, and do whatever they want. He tells me he‚Äôs not great at it yet, but he‚Äôs managed it once or twice. Not full awareness, he says. He realises he‚Äôs dreaming, but part of his brain is still sleeping, so he‚Äôs not really thinking logically or in any complex way, but still, he says the experience is really cool.



I take it with a grain of salt, to be honest. Ari has been known to tell a few tall tales, so my hopes aren‚Äôt particularly high, but still, I figure there‚Äôs no harm in looking it up when I get home that afternoon. My initial searches show me that there may have been truth to Ari‚Äôs words after all. I read up on some basic techniques, how to check if you‚Äôre in a dream, that you should never make the *assumption* that you‚Äôre in reality. I check if there are any serious risks, which apparently exist, but are rare. Sleep paralysis sounds kind of scary, and a few people complain of irritating headaches for a few days after they lucid dream, but I don‚Äôt come across anything too horrendous.¬†



Anyway, the websites all say not to expect results too quickly, and it‚Äôs a slow burn, so I rush through my homework, eat dinner and play playstation for a few hours before heading off to bed at 9, which my mum does think is a bit weird, but she doesn‚Äôt question it, just happy to see me getting a decent sleep for once, I guess.¬†



I know it said not to get my hopes up, but I admit, I did. Before long, I drift off to sleep, and then it happens.¬†



As if from nowhere, I awake. I‚Äôm at home, playing playstation like usual, but even without doing any tests or checks, I realise it: I‚Äôm in a dream.¬†



¬†I remember what Ari told me, and what I had read online: that it takes time to gain proper awareness in a lucid dream; at first it‚Äôs a sluggish train of thought, struggling against the brain‚Äôs natural inclination to shut itself down while asleep. I feel nothing like that, though. I feel incredible, more awake than when I‚Äôm *actually* awake. I look at my hand and marvel: my vision is crystal clear, my movements smooth and fluid, I stand up, feel infinite possibilities course through me and smile uncontrollably.



Remember that feeling I talked about? Of being a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù? Well, this was it. I knew this was finally it, something I was genuinely *amazing* at. I had full control of my dream. I snapped my fingers and my dingy room was at once replaced with a gorgeous sparkling beach, pearl-white sand and aquamarine ocean stretching out to the horizon. A banquet sprung up before me, covered in fried chicken, bacon-and-egg sandwiches, everything I could ever want. I looked behind me and there she was: Elle from class.¬†



Clad in a black two-piece that contrasted starkly to her seashell-pale skin, she grinned and pulled me into an embrace, closing her wonderful round, blue eyes wordlessly and kissed me.¬†



It was exactly how I had imagined it. Well, perhaps owing to the fact that I *was* imagining it, but still, it was so *visceral,* so *real.* I could feel her warmth, hear her voice exactly as she sounded in real life, it was uncanny.¬†



I pushed her away for a moment, smiling slyly, and conjured up with a mere notion, Richard Wrenn. I haven‚Äôt mentioned Richard until now because, well, he‚Äôs fundamentally quite unimportant, but just trust me on this: he‚Äôs a dick. And so, I took great satisfaction in directing him to stand ten metres from me, levelling my arm at him, and transforming my arm into a plasma cannon that proceeded to blast a two-foot-diameter hole in his torso. You might think this was a little cruel, and yes, maybe it was, but it wasn‚Äôt like he was *real*. He was just in my imagination. If he‚Äôd made me suffer a whole bunch in real life, I figured a little dream revenge that couldn‚Äôt actually hurt him wasn‚Äôt so bad in return.¬†



After watching him suffer for a moment, I vanished his burning corpse, and returned to my banquet, and to Elle.



I won‚Äôt bore you with the details of the next few hours, but just take this for my word: It was genuinely the most fun I‚Äôd ever had. Any wish that occurred to me, whatever I wanted, it was instantly granted.¬†



The only thing that bothered me was‚Ä¶ this little feeling. The best way I can describe it is: sometimes when I‚Äôm playing playstation and my mum isn‚Äôt home, I feel this sensation like she‚Äôs watching me from behind, and I turn around, even though I know she‚Äôs out and can‚Äôt possibly be there. It was a bit like that, like even though I was totally alone, like there were eyes burning into the back of my head.¬†



It was a little thing, though, and I only felt it briefly, once or twice, so I just ignored it. Eventually, I felt the dream start to fade as my sleep cycle naturally ended, and I woke up to a new day.¬†



It was an odd concoction of emotions: on one hand I felt incredibly well-rested. Most mornings I could barely drag myself out of bed, but today I felt revitalised, energetic, totally ready-to-do-it. I attributed this partly to actually getting a good night‚Äôs sleep for once, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that the lucid dream had something to do with it as well. Not only was it a great time, but it seemed to be like super-sleep, I was totally refreshed.¬†



Anyway, I walked to school more peppily than ever before, even having a little swagger in my step for a change. It felt odd seeing Elle in real life after my dream, but I played it cool and waved to her as I walked in, and to my surprise she gave me a big smile and waved back. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon for her to just blank me, so this was actually pretty big. It wasn‚Äôt making out on the beach, but still, a nice bonus to my already great morning.¬†



I couldn‚Äôt help but tell Ari how great I was doing, and how amazing my lucid dream was after I sat down beside him in class.¬†



‚ÄúWell, that makes one of us,‚Äù he grimaced back at me.¬†



He told me he‚Äôd had another sort-of half lucid dream last night, but now he had a splitting headache. I nodded and told him I‚Äôd read that could happen, he must‚Äôve got unlucky. He seemed kind of jealous when I told him how incredible my dream had been, but I think he wasn‚Äôt entirely sure I was telling the truth, which I thought was a bit rich coming from him.¬†



Anyway, the next few days were sort of a fuzzy blur. I won‚Äôt go through every little thing, but I‚Äôll give you the highlights. In short: they were awesome. Every night I had an amazing, full awareness lucid dream: I hung out with Ari, with Elle, feasted, explored the world and even the galaxy, it was genuinely too perfect to describe. In real life, too, I can‚Äôt fully explain it, but I think because I knew I could get whatever I wanted in my dream, I stopped worrying so much about the little things in day-to-day life, and so it all just flowed more easily. I was bursting with energy every day, I started talking to Elle for real, having lunch with her a couple of times. I even ran into Richard Wrenn in the corridor one day, and he just sort of winced and walked off without even hurling an insult at me! Everyone told me I was looking great, the bags under my eyes were gone, I even aced a maths test that I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd be lucky to escape with a C. It was all coming up roses.¬†



There were little niggles, though. That feeling‚Ä¶ The one of eyes burning into the back of my head, it didn‚Äôt really go away. Every night, I‚Äôd feel it for a little while, before it went away. I considered that I was imagining it, but part of me thought it stayed a little longer each night.¬†



I looked it up on the forums, but nobody else ever described anything like it. One thing I noticed, weirdly, though, was that a *lot* of people were complaining of severe headaches after lucid dreaming, just like Ari had. I searched old posts, and it turns out that these complaints had only started up in the past few months. At first, it was a few obscure mentions of mild headaches, but now there were multiple every day about real severe ones, so bad the people considered never trying to lucid dream again afterwards.¬†



I did think it was weird that the posts seemed to come out of nowhere in the past few months, but it wasn‚Äôt like it had anything to do with me. Even if I wanted to put my tinfoil hat on, the posts complaining about the headaches well pre-dated my starting to lucid dream, so it was impossible that they were related.¬†



Anyway, maybe a week after I started to lucid dream, something a little‚Ä¶ weird happened.¬†



I was chilling as always in dreamland, when just for a moment, everything faded to black, and I heard something.¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúArm the‚Ä¶ tachyon cannons.‚Äù¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúAre you sure, sir?‚Äô¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ doing them a favour. It‚Äôs for the best‚Ä¶ Do it.‚Äù



‚Ä¶



The voices had a strange cadence to them, and the words of the conversation were seared into my brain, I couldn‚Äôt have forgotten them if I tried.¬†



My dream world was back afterwards, only having been gone for a few seconds. It was a little disconcerting, to be sure, but normality returned soon afterwards, and I felt just as amazing as usual the next day.¬†



I chalked it up to an anomaly, maybe too many sci-fi video games kicking around in my thoughts. It was certainly a preferable side effect to the horrific headaches that kept popping up in the forums. I didn‚Äôt think much of it.¬†



At least, for the next few days.¬†



The forum posts about the headaches came with increasing frequency, but what *really* made me take notice was the next week, when I saw on tv: a news story. Several people had slipped into comas in their sleep, many were young and healthy, it was totally unexplained.¬†



I think I may have been the first to put two and two together when I realised: a very frequent poster on one of the lucid dreaming forums, a great helping hand to newcomers, out of nowhere, had simply vanished.¬†



Now, I‚Äôll admit, this scared me a bit. The risk of a headache was one thing, but a coma was another entirely. I considered trying to let the authorities know about what I‚Äôd noticed, but less than a day after I‚Äôd realised, they cottoned on, too. Official medical advice was issued across the globe: The medical causes were not entirely understood, but several people had lapsed into comas from which they had not awakened, due to lucid dreaming.¬†



Now I was properly frightened. I decided enough was enough. I‚Äôd had my fun, the dream world was fantastic, but it wasn‚Äôt worth the risk. Besides, my real life was going so great, I didn‚Äôt really need the dreams anymore anyway. Ari had been spooked by the news, but he and I were getting along great, and Elle and I had even hung out after school a few times, I was bucking up the courage to officially ask her out. Richard Wrenn hadn‚Äôt really shown his face, but my least favourite teacher, who I admit had appeared in my dream world a few times, had transferred schools a bit out of nowhere. I didn‚Äôt want to kill the golden goose, so I decided: I‚Äôd stop lucid dreaming, and focus on pressing my advantage in the real world.¬†



And, well, that should have been the end of it. I came to this decision about a week and a half ago. Goodbye, then, Jamie Aster signing out.



‚Ä¶¬†



Except, of course, it wasn‚Äôt that simple.¬†



When I went to bed that night, I woke up on that same wonderful beach. The sapphire waves, the fine, white sand. There was a totally different air to it now, though.¬†



I was aware. I was lucid.¬†



It was one thing to *choose* to lucid dream, it was another entirely to realise that the habit had become so ingrained that you couldn‚Äôt shake it.¬†



I shrugged my shoulders and figured, well, I did the crime, I might as well do the time, and so I had my fun.¬†



The mood was a bit dampened by the fact that I was honestly a bit scared that I‚Äôd slip into a coma and never wake up. That being-watched feeling hadn‚Äôt left, either. If anything, it was almost constant now, to the point that I was so used to it that I barely noticed it anymore.¬†



As per usual, though, the dream eventually faded, and I woke up in my bed, feeling fresh and new. I couldn‚Äôt help feeling, though, that the irrepressible energy coursing through me was just slightly less than it had been the previous day. I attributed it to the stress, and walked to school as usual.¬†



The next few days, things really started to get unsettling. Sorry if you‚Äôve been enjoying the feel-good mentions of daily school life, because you won‚Äôt be getting many anymore. Everyone was worried now. Dozens, then hundreds of people worldwide were slipping into comas, every day, and it wasn‚Äôt just lucid dreamers anymore.

That might sound a little melodramatic, but it‚Äôs true. Every day, thousands more fell¬† into comas, people panicked: it was all the news could talk about, mum came in and gave an increasingly forlorn and emotional ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù each evening.¬†



Elle even texted me before bed for the first time.¬†



‚Äú*Goodnight, Jamie. I‚Ä¶ hope I see you again at school tomorrow. I‚Äôll be honest. I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù*¬†

If you‚Äôre sharp, or, I guess, nitpicky, you‚Äôll be asking yourself ‚Äúhow does he know what it feels like to be a natural at something if he‚Äôs never experienced it?‚Äù Well, because for once in my life, three weeks ago, I finally did. It was so wonderful, I was elated. Now, though, I wish I never had that feeling. I wish I‚Äôd stayed in ignorance, blissful, blissful ignorance, I wouldn‚Äôt be cursed with knowing what I now know.¬†



Anyway, I should explain before I get carried away.¬†



Monday three weeks ago, I walk to school like it‚Äôs any old day. I‚Äôm struggling because I‚Äôve been up playing playstation until 2 am as usual, so the lights are on upstairs but nobody‚Äôs home. I trudge into class and take some half-hearted notes, stare a bit at Elle Lamonte in front of me, when my friend, Ari, taps me on the shoulder and begins the conversation that will seal my fate. After seeing the bags under my eyes and recoiling a little, telling me I need to get more sleep, he says he read something interesting online: ‚ÄúJamie, you‚Äôve gotta try this,‚Äù he insists. He tells me that with a bit of practice and awareness, a normal person can experience *lucid dreaming*, which I‚Äôd always thought was some sci-fi thing, but he promises me it‚Äôs real, anybody can learn to ‚Äòwake up‚Äô inside their own dream, and do whatever they want. He tells me he‚Äôs not great at it yet, but he‚Äôs managed it once or twice. Not full awareness, he says. He realises he‚Äôs dreaming, but part of his brain is still sleeping, so he‚Äôs not really thinking logically or in any complex way, but still, he says the experience is really cool.



I take it with a grain of salt, to be honest. Ari has been known to tell a few tall tales, so my hopes aren‚Äôt particularly high, but still, I figure there‚Äôs no harm in looking it up when I get home that afternoon. My initial searches show me that there may have been truth to Ari‚Äôs words after all. I read up on some basic techniques, how to check if you‚Äôre in a dream, that you should never make the *assumption* that you‚Äôre in reality. I check if there are any serious risks, which apparently exist, but are rare. Sleep paralysis sounds kind of scary, and a few people complain of irritating headaches for a few days after they lucid dream, but I don‚Äôt come across anything too horrendous.¬†



Anyway, the websites all say not to expect results too quickly, and it‚Äôs a slow burn, so I rush through my homework, eat dinner and play playstation for a few hours before heading off to bed at 9, which my mum does think is a bit weird, but she doesn‚Äôt question it, just happy to see me getting a decent sleep for once, I guess.¬†



I know it said not to get my hopes up, but I admit, I did. Before long, I drift off to sleep, and then it happens.¬†



As if from nowhere, I awake. I‚Äôm at home, playing playstation like usual, but even without doing any tests or checks, I realise it: I‚Äôm in a dream.¬†



¬†I remember what Ari told me, and what I had read online: that it takes time to gain proper awareness in a lucid dream; at first it‚Äôs a sluggish train of thought, struggling against the brain‚Äôs natural inclination to shut itself down while asleep. I feel nothing like that, though. I feel incredible, more awake than when I‚Äôm *actually* awake. I look at my hand and marvel: my vision is crystal clear, my movements smooth and fluid, I stand up, feel infinite possibilities course through me and smile uncontrollably.



Remember that feeling I talked about? Of being a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù? Well, this was it. I knew this was finally it, something I was genuinely *amazing* at. I had full control of my dream. I snapped my fingers and my dingy room was at once replaced with a gorgeous sparkling beach, pearl-white sand and aquamarine ocean stretching out to the horizon. A banquet sprung up before me, covered in fried chicken, bacon-and-egg sandwiches, everything I could ever want. I looked behind me and there she was: Elle from class.¬†



Clad in a black two-piece that contrasted starkly to her seashell-pale skin, she grinned and pulled me into an embrace, closing her wonderful round, blue eyes wordlessly and kissed me.¬†



It was exactly how I had imagined it. Well, perhaps owing to the fact that I *was* imagining it, but still, it was so *visceral,* so *real.* I could feel her warmth, hear her voice exactly as she sounded in real life, it was uncanny.¬†



I pushed her away for a moment, smiling slyly, and conjured up with a mere notion, Richard Wrenn. I haven‚Äôt mentioned Richard until now because, well, he‚Äôs fundamentally quite unimportant, but just trust me on this: he‚Äôs a dick. And so, I took great satisfaction in directing him to stand ten metres from me, levelling my arm at him, and transforming my arm into a plasma cannon that proceeded to blast a two-foot-diameter hole in his torso. You might think this was a little cruel, and yes, maybe it was, but it wasn‚Äôt like he was *real*. He was just in my imagination. If he‚Äôd made me suffer a whole bunch in real life, I figured a little dream revenge that couldn‚Äôt actually hurt him wasn‚Äôt so bad in return.¬†



After watching him suffer for a moment, I vanished his burning corpse, and returned to my banquet, and to Elle.



I won‚Äôt bore you with the details of the next few hours, but just take this for my word: It was genuinely the most fun I‚Äôd ever had. Any wish that occurred to me, whatever I wanted, it was instantly granted.¬†



The only thing that bothered me was‚Ä¶ this little feeling. The best way I can describe it is: sometimes when I‚Äôm playing playstation and my mum isn‚Äôt home, I feel this sensation like she‚Äôs watching me from behind, and I turn around, even though I know she‚Äôs out and can‚Äôt possibly be there. It was a bit like that, like even though I was totally alone, like there were eyes burning into the back of my head.¬†



It was a little thing, though, and I only felt it briefly, once or twice, so I just ignored it. Eventually, I felt the dream start to fade as my sleep cycle naturally ended, and I woke up to a new day.¬†



It was an odd concoction of emotions: on one hand I felt incredibly well-rested. Most mornings I could barely drag myself out of bed, but today I felt revitalised, energetic, totally ready-to-do-it. I attributed this partly to actually getting a good night‚Äôs sleep for once, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that the lucid dream had something to do with it as well. Not only was it a great time, but it seemed to be like super-sleep, I was totally refreshed.¬†



Anyway, I walked to school more peppily than ever before, even having a little swagger in my step for a change. It felt odd seeing Elle in real life after my dream, but I played it cool and waved to her as I walked in, and to my surprise she gave me a big smile and waved back. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon for her to just blank me, so this was actually pretty big. It wasn‚Äôt making out on the beach, but still, a nice bonus to my already great morning.¬†



I couldn‚Äôt help but tell Ari how great I was doing, and how amazing my lucid dream was after I sat down beside him in class.¬†



‚ÄúWell, that makes one of us,‚Äù he grimaced back at me.¬†



He told me he‚Äôd had another sort-of half lucid dream last night, but now he had a splitting headache. I nodded and told him I‚Äôd read that could happen, he must‚Äôve got unlucky. He seemed kind of jealous when I told him how incredible my dream had been, but I think he wasn‚Äôt entirely sure I was telling the truth, which I thought was a bit rich coming from him.¬†



Anyway, the next few days were sort of a fuzzy blur. I won‚Äôt go through every little thing, but I‚Äôll give you the highlights. In short: they were awesome. Every night I had an amazing, full awareness lucid dream: I hung out with Ari, with Elle, feasted, explored the world and even the galaxy, it was genuinely too perfect to describe. In real life, too, I can‚Äôt fully explain it, but I think because I knew I could get whatever I wanted in my dream, I stopped worrying so much about the little things in day-to-day life, and so it all just flowed more easily. I was bursting with energy every day, I started talking to Elle for real, having lunch with her a couple of times. I even ran into Richard Wrenn in the corridor one day, and he just sort of winced and walked off without even hurling an insult at me! Everyone told me I was looking great, the bags under my eyes were gone, I even aced a maths test that I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd be lucky to escape with a C. It was all coming up roses.¬†



There were little niggles, though. That feeling‚Ä¶ The one of eyes burning into the back of my head, it didn‚Äôt really go away. Every night, I‚Äôd feel it for a little while, before it went away. I considered that I was imagining it, but part of me thought it stayed a little longer each night.¬†



I looked it up on the forums, but nobody else ever described anything like it. One thing I noticed, weirdly, though, was that a *lot* of people were complaining of severe headaches after lucid dreaming, just like Ari had. I searched old posts, and it turns out that these complaints had only started up in the past few months. At first, it was a few obscure mentions of mild headaches, but now there were multiple every day about real severe ones, so bad the people considered never trying to lucid dream again afterwards.¬†



I did think it was weird that the posts seemed to come out of nowhere in the past few months, but it wasn‚Äôt like it had anything to do with me. Even if I wanted to put my tinfoil hat on, the posts complaining about the headaches well pre-dated my starting to lucid dream, so it was impossible that they were related.¬†



Anyway, maybe a week after I started to lucid dream, something a little‚Ä¶ weird happened.¬†



I was chilling as always in dreamland, when just for a moment, everything faded to black, and I heard something.¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúArm the‚Ä¶ tachyon cannons.‚Äù¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúAre you sure, sir?‚Äô¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ doing them a favour. It‚Äôs for the best‚Ä¶ Do it.‚Äù



‚Ä¶



The voices had a strange cadence to them, and the words of the conversation were seared into my brain, I couldn‚Äôt have forgotten them if I tried.¬†



My dream world was back afterwards, only having been gone for a few seconds. It was a little disconcerting, to be sure, but normality returned soon afterwards, and I felt just as amazing as usual the next day.¬†



I chalked it up to an anomaly, maybe too many sci-fi video games kicking around in my thoughts. It was certainly a preferable side effect to the horrific headaches that kept popping up in the forums. I didn‚Äôt think much of it.¬†



At least, for the next few days.¬†



The forum posts about the headaches came with increasing frequency, but what *really* made me take notice was the next week, when I saw on tv: a news story. Several people had slipped into comas in their sleep, many were young and healthy, it was totally unexplained.¬†



I think I may have been the first to put two and two together when I realised: a very frequent poster on one of the lucid dreaming forums, a great helping hand to newcomers, out of nowhere, had simply vanished.¬†



Now, I‚Äôll admit, this scared me a bit. The risk of a headache was one thing, but a coma was another entirely. I considered trying to let the authorities know about what I‚Äôd noticed, but less than a day after I‚Äôd realised, they cottoned on, too. Official medical advice was issued across the globe: The medical causes were not entirely understood, but several people had lapsed into comas from which they had not awakened, due to lucid dreaming.¬†



Now I was properly frightened. I decided enough was enough. I‚Äôd had my fun, the dream world was fantastic, but it wasn‚Äôt worth the risk. Besides, my real life was going so great, I didn‚Äôt really need the dreams anymore anyway. Ari had been spooked by the news, but he and I were getting along great, and Elle and I had even hung out after school a few times, I was bucking up the courage to officially ask her out. Richard Wrenn hadn‚Äôt really shown his face, but my least favourite teacher, who I admit had appeared in my dream world a few times, had transferred schools a bit out of nowhere. I didn‚Äôt want to kill the golden goose, so I decided: I‚Äôd stop lucid dreaming, and focus on pressing my advantage in the real world.¬†



And, well, that should have been the end of it. I came to this decision about a week and a half ago. Goodbye, then, Jamie Aster signing out.



‚Ä¶¬†



Except, of course, it wasn‚Äôt that simple.¬†



When I went to bed that night, I woke up on that same wonderful beach. The sapphire waves, the fine, white sand. There was a totally different air to it now, though.¬†



I was aware. I was lucid.¬†



It was one thing to *choose* to lucid dream, it was another entirely to realise that the habit had become so ingrained that you couldn‚Äôt shake it.¬†



I shrugged my shoulders and figured, well, I did the crime, I might as well do the time, and so I had my fun.¬†



The mood was a bit dampened by the fact that I was honestly a bit scared that I‚Äôd slip into a coma and never wake up. That being-watched feeling hadn‚Äôt left, either. If anything, it was almost constant now, to the point that I was so used to it that I barely noticed it anymore.¬†



As per usual, though, the dream eventually faded, and I woke up in my bed, feeling fresh and new. I couldn‚Äôt help feeling, though, that the irrepressible energy coursing through me was just slightly less than it had been the previous day. I attributed it to the stress, and walked to school as usual.¬†



The next few days, things really started to get unsettling. Sorry if you‚Äôve been enjoying the feel-good mentions of daily school life, because you won‚Äôt be getting many anymore. Everyone was worried now. Dozens, then hundreds of people worldwide were slipping into comas, every day, and it wasn‚Äôt just lucid dreamers anymore. They‚Äôd go to sleep, perfectly healthy, and then never wake up. People everywhere went back and forth between talking and speculating endlessly in a paranoid state, and burying their heads in the sand and pretending it wasn‚Äôt happening.¬†



I didn‚Äôt know what felt worse: worrying myself sick over something I didn‚Äôt understand and couldn‚Äôt stop, or pretending it wasn‚Äôt happening and sleepwalking into my potential oblivion.¬†



That might sound a little melodramatic, but it‚Äôs true. Every day, thousands more fell¬† into comas, people panicked: it was all the news could talk about, mum came in and gave an increasingly forlorn and emotional ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù each evening.¬†



Elle even texted me before bed for the first time.¬†



‚Äú*Goodnight, Jamie. I‚Ä¶ hope I see you again at school tomorrow. I‚Äôll be honest. I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù*¬†



Again, I remember it word for word, because even as worried as I was, it still felt amazing to hear from her. I called her up to reassure her, then went to sleep as always.¬†



I‚Äôd put on a brave face for my mum, and for Elle, but as uneasy as my waking life had become, I think I still preferred it over what my nightly inevitable lucid dream had become.¬†



What had once been paradise had become purgatory: A flat world where I simply could not shake my own paranoia, my growing fear.¬†



Any attempt at escapism felt hollow and I simply could not, no matter how I tried, force myself to be even a little distracted. As a result, I simply existed passively in the dream, awaiting the moment it would finally fade with anticipation that grew with each passing night.¬†



Also aggregating with each subsequent dream was the general feeling of uneasiness, and even dread, that permeated the atmosphere of my own dream world. I found, as my own mental state deteriorated, so too did my ability to maintain a pleasant environment in my dreams.¬†



Each night, the beach, which had become my default dream setting, seemed to grow a little darker. The sand grew grimier, the water more turbid. At first I thought I was imagining it, but after a few days I stood under a stormy sky, on filthy¬† sand strewn with rubbish, beside water choked with debris and spiny seaweed.¬†



Four days ago. That‚Äôs when I fully realised it. The daily coma numbers had reached the tens of thousands. People were staying home from school. There was even talk of shutting them down. Everyone I knew was panicking. I could barely focus on my playstation, let alone my homework. I went from living in fear each day, to living a nightmare every time I closed my eyes. I still felt rested and rejuvenated each morning, but even that sensation was fading. It felt almost like a cruel joke at this point, like my body was at odds with the world around me.¬†



It was that night. Three sleeps ago. I sat, inert, inside my decaying dream purgatory. A few nights prior to this I would have been panicked, trying to stop the rot, but I was resigned at this point. I retreated further inside my head, suppressing my own awareness. I would wake soon, I thought. That would at least bring some release, even if it was only through a different sort of torment.¬†



As if it were a great bolt of lightning, striking a desolate stretch of silent, dead Earth, it appeared.¬†



Richard Wrenn flashed before me, and turned to face me.¬†



I realised, as soon as I gazed upon his visage, that these were the eyes that had been watching me, ever since my first lucid dream.¬†



I also realised that this was not simply Richard Wrenn. As soon as he entered my eyeline, as soon as his mental presence came within proximity of my own, I felt an overwhelming sense of panic overcome me. It was not ordinary fear. No, what I felt was akin to the sensation one feels when a bright torchlight is pressed against one‚Äôs eyelid. Even though the eye closes, and the body does everything it can to cope, it is simply powerless to repel the sheer force of the entity it is confronted with.¬†

My dream world felt as if it were a pea inside its pod, faced with a supermassive star forcing its way in. I screamed, and fell to the floor, managing to perceive, even as I clawed at my own eyes, Richard Wrenn smile grimly as I writhed in agony.¬†



‚ÄúQuail, feeble one, at the deliverance, in the form you so fear, of the World Eater.‚Äù¬†



Hearing it speak, in a voice that was certainly not Richard‚Äôs, assaulted my senses through their inability to comprehend it. The words made sense, but each syllable seemed somehow pregnant with meaning fathoms beyond my brain‚Äôs paltry capacity. It was this night that I truly came to realise the pettiness of my own existence, the inadequacy of my cognition and senses, the truly inconsequential nature of every action I had ever taken, every ambition I had ever possessed.¬†



As soon as he had arrived, he flashed once more and my dream world returned, although I had not.¬†



I remained on the tainted sand, hyperventilating, my mind struggling to form a coherent thought in the face of the firestorm with which it had been faced. It took hours for me to recover my senses, and when I did, I simply sat, knees pressed to my chest, and quivered with terror. That is how I wiled away my sentence that night. I am not certain how many hours I spent in the dream in that state, but when I woke, I was overjoyed.¬†



It superseded every joyful awakening sensation I had ever felt after a lucid dream. Every petty pleasure within the dream world, every previously treasured success in the real world, each one paled pathetically in comparison to the pure bliss of awakening shivering, cold, and in pain all over.¬†



Of rising to find blood dripping from my eyes, cold sweat oozing forth from every pore, shudders wracking my whole body. Every movement was ecstasy, simply for having escaped the dream world where I had faced that horror. The World Eater.¬†



Since then, it is difficult to describe my experience, difficult as the language developed by us human beings was intended to explain things that could reasonably happen in our lives. ‚ÄúSuffering‚Äù is viewed in the lens of suffering within normal human existence. As such, I cannot so easily describe the next two days: I lay, catatonic in my bed, bleeding from my eyes and from where my fingernails had scratched into my skin, for I scarcely felt even the slightest stimulation from waking pain anymore, and rather than attempting to scratch myself I merely failed to notice when my nails had rent open my flesh. I paid no heed to my mother‚Äôs concerns, nor to Elle or Ari‚Äôs texts or calls. I did not play my playstation, nor even consider going to school, I merely lay in bed quaking with fear until I inevitably could not force myself to stay awake any longer.¬†



My waking life was bliss compared to being tortured by the world eater during my sleep: subjected to a phantasmagoria of images beyond the furthest fathoms of my reckoning, and yet nonetheless capable of evoking unimaginable pain, terror, and despair in my mind, feeble as it was.¬†



The World Eater did not speak to me any further. It had no need to, I gleaned understanding of its thoughts through its ransacking the every entrail of my psyche. I felt its growing boredom with drawing the human race into an eternal oblivion of nightmare, and its ponderings on finding a new civilisation to annihilate. Its subtle glee at discovering the alien spacecraft that tracked it, and planned to annihilate Earth with tachyon weaponry to save us our eternal damnation, only to be conquered by the World Eater themselves, its mockery and disappointment at seeing humanity‚Äôs most gifted at control within the unconscious world utilise it for such petty reasons and activities. Most of the World Eater‚Äôs feelings towards Earth and humans were mere notions, he felt that they were inconsequential, but there was a severity to his resentment for me in particular, and this was made clear through my suffering, though only a normal night‚Äôs sleep in the real world, it seemed for all intents and purposes to me to last for countless aeons.¬†



There is almost relief now, as I lie awake writing this, slipping inevitably towards sleep, that this will be the final time. I know. Somehow I know. After I fall to the World Eater‚Äôs domain this time, I will never wake. I have managed to rise to drink as much coffee as I can stomach, I have blasted music in my ears, I have bitten the insides of my cheeks so hard I taste my metallic blood with every swallow. I can stave off sleep for no longer.¬† I can hope only that death will eventually claim me, and save me from the eternal nightmare.¬†



That is, if even death himself can supersede his grasp.¬†

Overall a great modern interpretation of classic Sicilian dishes and ingredients. The service was exceptional. The restaurant has just 5 tables with only 2 people working in the service, but everything went incredibly smooth. The staff is attentive and warm but not in your face or pushy. The timing of the dishes was impeccable and a special shoutout to Lodovico, who helped us select a Sicilian wine (Primavera from I Vigneri, highly recommended). 

Highlights from the menu for us were the uni/melon sorbet, the eggplant with goat cheese and the lamb with liquid salad. Also easily the best two pasta dishes we ate during our trip. 

The only part that didn‚Äôt quite live up to the rest were the odd choices for the final 3 courses: I don‚Äôt know if there might be some sort of Sicilian tradition involved in this order of dishes but eating a heavy bread ‚Äúpudding‚Äù with onions after the lamb dish felt odd to us. The dish itself was good, but it didn‚Äôt quite fit the rest of the menu. 

The other criticism we had, albeit a very subjective one, were the 2 dessert courses, which were both cream/foam-based without any solid ingredients and felt a bit too gimmicky in their presentation. I can‚Äôt even count anymore how many times I‚Äôve been served a ceramic egg in an egg carton in the last few years. This one felt quite well thought out, passion fruit egg yolk and almond ‚Äúsalt‚Äù and all, but personally I prefer something to chew on when it comes to desserts. Same goes for #2: a foamy sorbet of coffee, green tea and fruits similar to tiramisu that you had to ‚Äúsmoke‚Äù out of the glass pipe. Great flavor, but also lacking something solid to balance out the foam. The praline at the end almost made up for it, though. Modica is known for its chocolate and this little ball of glory did not disappoint. 

Overall, I‚Äôd still recommend Accursio without hesitation since the negatives came down to our personal taste. ",4,1728301331.0,finedining,2,1.0,False

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love animals too, but her dog is... let‚Äôs just say, not very well-behaved. A few months ago, I invited her over for a weekend hangout, and she insisted on bringing her dog. I was hesitant because my place isn‚Äôt really pet-proofed, but I said okay because I didn‚Äôt want to cause any drama. Big mistake. Her dog ended up chewing through one of my couch cushions and scratching up my coffee table. It was a disaster.

I didn‚Äôt make a big deal about it at the time because she promised to cover the cost of the damage. Fast forward to now, and she still hasn‚Äôt paid me back a single cent. Last week, she asked if she could bring her dog over again, and this time I told her no. I explained that while I love hanging out with her, I can‚Äôt risk more damage to my home, especially when she hasn‚Äôt compensated me for the last time.

She got really upset, saying I‚Äôm overreacting and that I know how much her dog means to her.

Hello!

I‚Äôm 40 years old, I‚Äôve been suffering from chronic acid reflux for 5 years, and I‚Äôm experiencing symptoms of hormonal imbalance.

I recently decided to do everything I can to age healthily and get rid of my digestive issues. In addition to nutritional changes, I‚Äôve decided to quit caffeine and‚Ä¶ alcohol.

I don‚Äôt see myself as having an addiction, but it‚Äôs a bad habit. I drink often, sometimes 6-8 days in a row but in small amounts. It‚Äôs often a way to relax after long days at work. I frequently take breaks from drinking for 2 to 8 weeks, but I‚Äôd like to quit for good because even in moderation, it‚Äôs unhealthy.

Just like quitting coffee, fast food, and dairy, I feel it‚Äôs going to be tough to stop drinking alcohol, especially with my active social life. I know I‚Äôm capable, but I need tools to help maintain my efforts, as I tend to easily give up on my attempts. I usually tend to be very enthousiast and motivated at first, then give up haha ü§°üòñ

What I‚Äôm Looking For: I‚Äôm looking beta readers to give feedback on the first draft of my novel. I‚Äôm specifically looking for feedback on the overall plot, character development, pacing, and consistency. 

Blurb: Addie never expected her summer job at Black Ink Coffee to come with strings attached. Hired as a barista after her first year of college, she‚Äôs just trying to support herself through school to create a better future. Then she meets Pierce‚Äîthe tattooed, mysterious owner who‚Äôs made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt get involved with his staff. But the undeniable attraction between them soon proves impossible to resist, and they dive into what they think is a summer fling. 

When Addie discovers she‚Äôs pregnant, their carefree arrangement turns into something much more complicated. As Pierce wrestles with the demons of his high-society family, Addie must confront the grief of losing her mother, a wound that‚Äôs never fully healed. 

With both of their worlds unraveling, Addie and Pierce are forced to face their fears and decide if they can build a life together‚Äîor if their broken pasts will keep them apart for good. 

Excerpt: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never felt that way about anyone,‚Äù I admit quietly. That‚Äôs why this is so difficult. What I feel for Pierce isn‚Äôt like the friendship I have with Emily. It‚Äôs deeper, more intense, and it scares me. It‚Äôs new and unfamiliar territory, and I don‚Äôt know how to navigate it.

As the truck rumbles down Main Street, I watch the sleepy little town pass by. The shops and restaurants are all dark, their lights out for the night. The only illumination comes from the street lamps, casting a warm glow through the sunroof. It‚Äôs peaceful.

When Pierce turns down a side street and pulls into the parking lot behind Black Ink, I‚Äôm caught off guard. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit early for my shift, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù I joke, trying to lighten the mood, but there‚Äôs a tension in the air that wasn‚Äôt there before. Pierce‚Äôs hands grip the steering wheel so tightly that the veins in his forearms are visible, and his jaw is clenched in a way that makes my heart skip a beat.

I unbuckle my seatbelt and turn to face him; concern etched on my face. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù
He sighs deeply, closing his eyes and pressing his forehead against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never felt this way about anyone?‚Äù he asks, repeating my earlier words. I shake my head, my hands fidgeting nervously in my lap.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I say softly, my voice barely above a whisper.

Pierce takes a deep breath, then turns his head to look at me, his hazel eyes dark in the dim light. His gaze is intense, piercing through me in a way that makes me blush. I can tell he‚Äôs wrestling with something, his expression a mixture of frustration and something else I can‚Äôt quite place.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I ask, sliding closer to him in the space between us. I place my hand on his thigh, hoping to offer some comfort. His gaze drops to my hand, and he takes his hand off the steering wheel, placing it on top of mine. His fingers wrap around mine, his thumb gently stroking the top, sending a shiver down my spine. I should pull my hand away, but I don‚Äôt. 

The air in the truck is thick with tension, but it‚Äôs different now. It‚Äôs no longer the uncomfortable tension of unspoken words and unresolved feelings. It‚Äôs something else, something electric, something that feels like it could change everything in an instant. 

He squeezes my hand, his touch both firm and reassuring, before sitting up. His gaze locks onto mine, a mixture of determination and desire flickering in his eyes. 

‚ÄúFuck my stupid rules,‚Äù he mutters with a low growl, his voice thick with frustration. Before my mind can fully process his words, I feel his lips crashing against mine with a fierce, consuming urgency.

I instinctively wrap my arms around his neck, pulling him closer as our bodies intertwine. This kiss is a world away from the tentative, exploratory one we shared the other night. It‚Äôs no longer gentle and restrained; it‚Äôs raw and hungry, filled with all the tension that‚Äôs been building between us. I moan deeply into his mouth as his teeth nip at my lower lip, tugging it just enough to heighten the intensity before he deepens the kiss.

1fy5erz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1fy5erz/the_inability_to_make_functioning_relationships/,The inability to make functioning relationships,"Something happened this weekend that made me realise that I have really bad skills at making functioning relationships.

I'm staring my 58th birthday in the face.  And for the very first time in my life I truly have a friend where our relationship is even.

Apart from my husband, I can honestly say this is my first time having a functioning relationship.

My father's narcissism ruled my childhood and my life up until just a few years ago when he died.  None of the so called 'friends' that my parents had were real friends.  They were just the people who lived in their road and they would host dinners with.  Everyone one of them would vie to be top dog and the relationships between them were based on what they could get from each other.

At school I had problems getting closed to people and as I went to the next school each time, the people in my circle would change and I would loose touch with them.  So I became very good at making acquaintances but¬†not at making friends.

Moving into work, this made me exceptional at networking but still not at integrating with the people I worked with.

If I made a 'friend,' it would nearly always have the same dynamics as the relationship with my father. I would be the one doing all the work, providing them with what they needed and getting nothing back.

A common phrase I would hear from them was their complaining that I didn't respond to them immediately or put their needs above my own.  

There was one 'friend' who never asked for money but would sit and cry about how bad it was until I would almost force her to let me lend it to her.  Of course, I never got it back.  

They say don't lend money unless you can afford to give it but when the amount 'lent' got too much for me to keep on giving I finally told her, in the midst of her wailing about how upset her son was about something and how he needed the money and she didn't have it, that I said that on this occasion I couldn't offer to lend her the money because I didn't have it myself to give.  

She looked offended and said that she had 'never asked' me to lend her money.  I pointed out that she had always accepted it though, with the promise to pay it back but I had accepted that she wasn't able to each time and now, I had no spare money to give her.  And that was when she told me that I was letting her down  when she needed help the most.

After that, I just started to put distance between us because I couldnt' cope with her texts and messages until she moved on to another 'friend'.  I have never ghosted someone before but each time I saw her name flash on my phone it made me physically sick and I avoided her.

I wouldn't learn from one experience to the next.  I even had a total physical breakdown trying to do everything for a boyfriend who did nothing for me.  Driving hundreds of miles to help him when his mother was ill, cooking, cleaning, and shopping for him.  Then, having him scream at me if he came to my flat because I hadn't cleaned in 2 days or didn't buy the food he wanted when he never contributed anything to his stays (because guests don't have to).  I thought this was how it was because this was how I saw my father behave.

My siblings had friends, but by the time I was born (much later than them), my father had perfected his controlling behaviour, so I, as the 'good child', towed the line and thought that this was normal.  

So, why now am I thinking all about this?

Well, last year I got to know someone.  We started as acquaintances in a larger group, then began to do things in a smaller group then just the two of us.  A couple of months back they gave me a key ring that said something along the lines of that they now know what a real friend looks like and it's me.

I had to go to the hospital for a minor op and when I was talking about it, they asked me if I'd like them to take me as they knew that last time hubby took me he got me so stressed they were going to admit me due to my blood pressure.  

Then last Friday, we decided to go shopping together and grab a coffee.  We bumped into an acquaintance of mine and this friend turned to them and said how I had come to be their best friend.

I'm standing there, trying not to cry because I realised that they are my best friend.  That the two of us expect nothing from the other but happily give everything.  We talk and share our thoughts, we see things that the other might like and send a message with a link to it, we look at the world in the same way and are able to share our joys and frustrations with each other.  We talk every other day and live within 5 mins of each other.  And, bearing in mind my husband doesn't like visitors, she is the only person he is happy to see when she pops round.

And now, I have a functioning relationship with someone other than my husband.  ",4,1728300812.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I planned to pay for it, but at the end of the meal my date just grabbed the bill and paid. I guess I was taken off guard because I kind of just said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù instead of insisting on grabbing my half. Once it was paid I felt it would be weird to offer to transfer him, so I just said thank you for dinner again when we parted ways. I feel terrible that he paid for me to waste food, and am wondering if this is the reason he never asked me on a second. Like I‚Äôve said I‚Äôve known him for awhile, and in that time have offered to buy coffees etc so I hope he knows I‚Äôm not using him for money.

","i have a friend who is in a 1 year relationship with her boyfriend. inside that year, ang dami na nila naging away pero walang cheating, lying, or any major issue. yung mga usual fights ng couple. of course as a friend, i let her vent to me. and minsan sa venting niya, narerealize niya na she deserved so much better yada yada. ilang beses na sila nag break up and nagkabalikan. and every time before na magbreak up sila, my friend would tell me she is tired and angry blah blah. tapos days later, magiging sila. the cycle goes on.

kaso there is something that bothers me na every time na may ginawang sweet sa kanya bf niya (e.g. hinatid pauwi, binigyan ng flowers, nakakapunta kahit saan-saan) she'll jokingly boast it to me by saying ""inggit ka nanaman"", ""talo na namin kayo, ganto ganyan na nagagawa namin"" ""inggit ka lang e"" which btw, lahat ginawa na sa akin ng bf ko. 

siguro nabobother ako kasi i dont think its a good look na im the one who is comforting her kapag nadodown siya sa away nilang magjowa, na mostly kasalanan ng guy, pero the moment na nakaranas siya ng sweetness, she'll joke na ""inggit ako"" when my rs is not as toxic and complicated as them + my boyfriend has been doing it to me ever since. like what is there to inggit!?!? i thought na mas ok siguro na gawin nyang ganyan to her other friends na di alam yung mga away nilang magjowa. siguro naooverjoy lang siya, kaya niya nasasabi yun pero im the only close friend she only has kaya ako lahat sumasalo.  fyi, i have another friend din na niligawan ng bf niya ngayon for a year. lahat ginawa na ng boy, binigyan flowers, chocolates, coffee dates, etc etc., kinkwento sa akin yun ng friend ko and gano siya kinikilig pero never ONCE, sinabihan ako ng friend ko na ""inggit ka nanaman"" likeee üò≠

I broke up with my girlfriend two months ago, and the reason she gave was that there wasn‚Äôt an emotional connection anymore. Toward the end of the relationship, she said we felt more like friends, and she couldn‚Äôt see a future with someone who wasn‚Äôt emotionally connected. At first, I didn‚Äôt fully understand, but I‚Äôve spent time reflecting on my mistakes and realized where I went wrong. I admit I was selfish and didn‚Äôt listen to her needs.

A week ago, I sent her a heartfelt letter apologizing, acknowledging my mistakes, and letting her know I‚Äôd changed. We talked briefly after that, but she was really harsh and told me that even though I finally understood, it was too late and there was no future for us. When I asked if she had any feelings left for me, she said no. This is hard to believe since we were together for almost two years, and it feels like her feelings couldn‚Äôt have completely disappeared in just two months. It‚Äôs confusing because just a few weeks before we broke up, we went on a trip, and everything seemed fine, even though we did have some arguments. It feels like such a sudden shift.

Now, I‚Äôm stuck between wanting to move on and thinking maybe we could reconnect. Part of me wants to ask her to meet for coffee and have a deep conversation about everything‚Äîwhy we really broke up, if there‚Äôs any chance of starting fresh, or if I should just let it go. I don‚Äôt want to beg or come across as desperate, and I‚Äôve already said sorry in my letter, so I‚Äôm not sure what else I could say that I haven‚Äôt already.

At the same time, I love her deeply, and it‚Äôs hard to accept that things could just end like this. I know that even if we got back together, things wouldn‚Äôt be the same, but I still can‚Äôt help thinking about it. On the other hand, I‚Äôm worried that if I reach out again, it will seem like I‚Äôm stuck and can‚Äôt move on, which makes me feel like I‚Äôm lowering my self-worth. I‚Äôm also unsure if two months of change is enough for her to believe I‚Äôve grown or if she‚Äôs already moved on for good.

I‚Äôm torn between letting go and trying to reconnect, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I move on and focus on myself, or is it worth reaching out to her one more time?",6,1728299891.0,AITAH,9,0.8,False

Whether you're planning a major renovation or simply looking to refresh your interiors, staying ahead of the trends can help you elevate your space with ease. This year, it's all about combining practicality with artistic flair, allowing homeowners to create stylish and comfortable environments. From [hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) to [carpets and rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) that anchor a room, to the rise of statement [pendant lights for kitchen](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), here are the top home decor trends for 2024 that will inspire your next home makeover.

**1. Layered Lighting: The Power of Hanging and Pendant Lights**

Lighting plays a crucial role in setting the mood and tone of any space, and 2024 is all about layered lighting that enhances both functionality and aesthetics. Hanging lights and pendant lights for kitchens are making a bold comeback, offering both task and accent lighting with a sleek and modern touch.

In the kitchen, pendant lights are becoming a key focal point. Whether suspended over a kitchen island or breakfast bar, these lights not only provide direct illumination but also create a sophisticated atmosphere. Opt for oversized pendant lights with metallic finishes or geometric designs for a striking effect. For a more minimalist approach, choose glass or matte-finish pendants that blend seamlessly into the overall design while still making a statement.

Hanging lights are also gaining popularity beyond the kitchen. Whether used in dining rooms, living rooms, or bedrooms, these lights bring a sense of elegance and dimension to any space. In 2024, we expect to see more creative and sculptural hanging light designs that double as art installations, adding visual interest while maintaining functionality.

**2. Earthy, Natural Textures in Carpets and Rugs**

Another big trend for 2024 is the return to nature, especially in the form of earthy textures and sustainable materials. Carpets and rugs made from natural fibers like jute, sisal, and wool are becoming must-have pieces for modern interiors. These materials not only bring a sense of warmth and coziness to a room, but they also promote sustainability, which is a growing concern for eco-conscious homeowners.

Rugs with neutral tones, organic patterns, and textured weaves are perfect for grounding your space and adding subtle layers to your decor. In living rooms, large area rugs help to define zones within open floor plans, while smaller, textured rugs can create cozy corners in bedrooms or reading nooks. For a bold touch, consider adding rugs with geometric or abstract designs to contrast with more subdued furniture and decor.

The focus for 2024 is on using carpets and rugs to add depth and comfort while maintaining a natural, effortless look. Layering different sizes or textures of rugs is another trend gaining traction, offering a stylish way to add dimension to your flooring.

**3. Statement Pieces with Artistic Flair**

As minimalism continues to evolve, 2024 introduces a new approach that blends clean lines with bold, statement pieces that express personality. Unique furniture and decor items, such as sculptural coffee tables, bold artwork, and eccentric lighting, are key to achieving this look.

The focus is on fewer but more meaningful pieces. Instead of filling a room with numerous small decor items, opt for one or two statement pieces that draw the eye and elevate the overall style of the space. Think oversized pendant lights in the kitchen, large ceramic vases, or dramatic wall art. These eye-catching items serve as focal points, bringing a sense of individuality to your home while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic.

**4. Biophilic Design: Bringing the Outdoors In**

Biophilic design, which emphasizes a connection with nature, is set to dominate home decor trends in 2024. Incorporating natural elements like plants, natural light, and organic materials into your interiors can create a calming and harmonious environment.

One way to introduce biophilic design is by incorporating hanging lights and decor items made from natural materials like wood, bamboo, or stone. Wooden pendant lights, for example, can soften the harshness of a modern kitchen and bring an earthy, organic feel to the space. Adding greenery, such as potted plants or hanging planters, can further enhance this natural vibe, making your home feel fresh and inviting.

**5. Curved Furniture and Soft Edges**

Sharp, angular furniture is taking a backseat to more rounded, organic shapes in 2024. Sofas, armchairs, and coffee tables with curved edges are gaining popularity, bringing a sense of softness and fluidity to modern interiors.

Pairing these rounded furniture pieces with other organic materials‚Äîsuch as carpets and rugs with curved patterns‚Äîcan create a balanced, harmonious look. This trend is all about comfort and approachability, with furniture that invites you to relax and unwind.

**6. Personalized Kitchens with Pendant Lighting**

Kitchens are no longer just utilitarian spaces‚Äîthey're becoming focal points of home design. In 2024, the trend is to personalize kitchens with eye-catching elements that bring personality and warmth to the space. Pendant lights for kitchens are a simple yet effective way to achieve this.

Choose pendant lights that reflect your style, whether it‚Äôs industrial, contemporary, or rustic. Consider grouping several pendants at varying heights for a more dynamic, layered effect. Pendant lights with unique shapes or materials, such as woven rattan or sleek metals, can instantly elevate the look of your kitchen while providing essential task lighting.

**Conclusion: Stay on Trend in 2024**

The home decor trends of 2024 emphasize a harmonious blend of practicality, sustainability, and artistic expression. From layered lighting that includes hanging lights and pendant lights for kitchens, to natural textures in carpets and rugs, these trends will help you create a home that feels both stylish and comfortable. By incorporating statement pieces, biophilic design, and soft-edged furniture, you can refresh your space and stay ahead of the design curve in the year to come.

# Case Study: My Journey as a Beta Tester

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""Sure, it sounds great on paper, but does it really work?"" Well, let me tell you about my experience as a beta tester for Brainy POD Generator.

When I first got my hands on this software, I was skeptical. I mean, how much money could there really be in animal Sudoku puzzles? But boy, was I in for a surprise!

I decided to create a series of puzzle books targeted at different age groups. I made ""Easy Animal Sudoku for Preschoolers,"" ""Challenging Critter Puzzles for Big Kids,"" and even ""Extreme Animal Sudoku for Puzzle Masters.""

I listed these books on Amazon KDP, set up a simple Facebook ad campaign, and crossed my fingers. The results? Let's just say I had to uncross those fingers pretty quick to start counting my earnings!

In the first month alone, I sold over 500 copies across my different titles. Parents were snapping them up for road trips, teachers were buying class sets, and grandparents were grabbing them as gifts.

But here's the kicker ‚Äì the real gold mine was in custom orders. A local zoo contacted me to create a custom puzzle book featuring their animals as a gift shop item. A children's party planner commissioned personalized puzzles as party favors. Even a dentist ordered a batch to keep kids entertained in the waiting room!

By the end of three months, I had recouped my investment in Brainy POD Generator many times over. And the best part? The ongoing passive income from my puzzle books means I'm still making money while I sleep.

So, if you're wondering whether Brainy POD Generator can really deliver results, take it from someone who's been there ‚Äì this tool is the real deal.

This means you can rebrand the software as your own and sell it with full rights to your customers. If you're serious about building a software business, this is the way to go.

# OTO 4: MRR

If the white label option is a bit too rich for your blood, you can still grab Master Resell Rights for $16-$34. This lets you sell the software and pass on resell rights to your customers.

Remember, these are just the planned offers. The creators reserve the right to tweak this funnel for maximum conversions. So if you see something you like, don't wait too long!

# Dominating the Competition: Stay Ahead of the Pack

In the cutthroat world of POD, standing out is crucial. Here's how Brainy POD Generator can help you leave your competitors in the dust:

# 1. First Mover Advantage

By jumping on this tool early, you can establish yourself as the go-to source for animal Sudoku puzzles before the market gets saturated.

# 2. Unique Offering

While everyone else is pushing the same old t-shirts and mugs, you'll be offering something fresh and engaging.

# 3. Cross-Niche Appeal

These puzzles sit at the intersection of education, entertainment, and cute animals. That's a trifecta of marketability right there.

# 4. Endless Variety

With the ability to mix and match animals, difficulty levels, and designs, you can create an endless stream of new products to keep your customers coming back.

# 5. Brand Building

Use these unique puzzles as a foundation to build a recognizable brand in the children's educational product space.

# 6. Upsell Opportunities

Start with individual puzzles, then upsell to books, then to subscription services. The possibilities for customer lifetime value are huge.

Remember, in business, it's not always about being the best ‚Äì it's about being different. And with Brainy POD Generator, you've got different in spades!

# Money-Back Policy: Your Safety Net

I get it. Investing in new software can be scary. What if it doesn't work? What if it's not what you expected? Well, the folks behind Brainy POD Generator have got your back.

They offer a 15-day money-back guarantee for technical reasons. That means if you run into any technical issues that they can't resolve, you can get a full refund. It's like a safety net for your investment.

Now, let's be clear ‚Äì this isn't a ""try it and return it if you don't like it"" kind of deal. The refund is specifically for technical issues. But hey, given how user-friendly this software is, the chances of running into unsolvable technical problems are slimmer than a supermodel on a juice cleanse.

# Price: What's It Going to Cost Me?

Alright, let's talk turkey. How much is this marvel of modern software engineering going to set you back? Brace yourself, because the price might just knock your socks off ‚Äì in a good way!

During the early bird period (the first 3 days of launch), you can snag Brainy POD Generator for just $8.45. That's less than the cost of two fancy coffees! After the early bird period, the price goes up to $14.

But remember, this isn't just software you're buying. You're getting resale rights too. That means you can turn around and sell this to your own customers. At these prices, you could potentially make your money back with just one or two sales.

And let's not forget about the potential earnings from the puzzles you create. Sell a few puzzle books on Amazon, and this software could pay for itself many times over.

In the world of business investments, this is what we call a no-brainer, folks.

# Bundle Deal: More Bang for Your Buck

Now, if you're anything like me, you love a good deal. And boy, do I have a doozy for you! While the details aren't fully disclosed, word on the street is that there's a bundle deal in the works that'll make your entrepreneurial heart skip a beat.

Rumor has it that you might be able to snag not just Brainy POD Generator, but also the two additional POD apps mentioned in the OTOs, all for a discounted price. We're talking serious value here, people!

Imagine having not one, not two, but three powerful POD tools in your arsenal, all working together to build your print-on-demand empire. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for the POD world!

Now, I can't give you the exact details or pricing (a guy's gotta maintain some mystery, right?), but keep your eyes peeled for this bundle deal when Brainy POD Generator launches. If you're serious about dominating the POD space, this could be the golden ticket you've been waiting for.

# The Brains Behind the Operation: Who Created This Gem?

You might be wondering, ""Who are the geniuses behind this software?"" Well, let me tell you, these aren't just some fly-by-night operators looking to make a quick buck.

Brainy POD Generator is the brainchild of a team of seasoned software developers and marketers. These folks have been in the trenches of the POD and software development world for years. They've seen what works, what doesn't, and most importantly, what's missing in the market.

While they prefer to keep a low profile (probably too busy counting their money, if you ask me), their track record speaks for itself. They've developed and launched several successful software products in the past, always with a focus on user-friendliness and practical applications for online entrepreneurs.

What sets this team apart is their commitment to ongoing support and development. They're not just going to launch this product and disappear into the sunset. No sir, they're in it for the long haul, ready to provide updates, improvements, and top-notch customer support.

In the world of online marketing tools, that kind of dedication is rarer than a unicorn sighting. So when you invest in Brainy POD Generator, you're not just getting a piece of software ‚Äì you're joining a community of successful entrepreneurs led by a team that knows their stuff.

[**Get access to¬† Brainy POD Generator here**](https://softtechhub.us/Brainy%20POD%20Generator)

# Launch Date: Mark Your Calendars!

Listen up, because this is important. Brainy POD Generator is set to launch on October 3rd at 10 AM US Central Time. That's right, it's just around the corner!

Now, why should you care about the exact launch date and time? Two words: Early Bird. Remember that sweet $8.45 price I mentioned earlier? That's only available for the first three days after launch. After that, the price jumps up to $14.

But here's the thing ‚Äì the best deals often sell out fast. Really fast. I'm talking blink-and-you'll-miss-it fast. So if you want to snag this software at the lowest possible price, you need to be ready to pounce when the clock strikes 10 AM on October 3rd.

Set an alarm, write it on your forehead, hire a town crier to remind you ‚Äì whatever it takes. Because missing this launch could mean missing out on a serious business opportunity.

And hey, even if you're reading this after the launch date, don't worry. Brainy POD Generator is still a steal at $14. But if you can get in during that early bird period, why wouldn't you?

# Support: We've Got Your Back

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. ""Sure, this software sounds great, but what happens if I run into problems? Am I going to be left high and dry?""

Fear not, my entrepreneurial friends! The team behind Brainy POD Generator takes customer support seriously. Like, really seriously. Here's what you can expect:

1. **Email Support**: Got a question? Need some help? Just shoot an email to diego@dominateit.com. They promise to get back to you within 2-10 hours on weekdays. That's faster than most of my friends respond to my texts!
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: The software comes with detailed documentation that walks you through every feature and function. It's like having a personal tutor, minus the awkward small talk.
3. **Video Tutorials**: For those of us who are more visually inclined, there are video tutorials that show you exactly how to use the software, step by step.
4. **Regular Updates**: The team is committed to continuously improving the software. That means regular updates to fix any bugs and add new features.
5. **Community Support**: As Brainy POD Generator grows in popularity, expect to see a community of users sharing tips, tricks, and success stories.

Remember, the success of this product depends on the success of its users. So rest assured, when you invest in Brainy POD Generator, you're not just getting a piece of software ‚Äì you're getting a whole support system.

# Platform Accessibility: Where Can You Use It?

Alright, let's address the elephant in the room ‚Äì or should I say, the operating system in the computer. Brainy POD Generator is a Windows-based software. That means you'll need a PC running Windows to use it.

Now, before all you Mac users start throwing your artisanal, ethically sourced apples at me, hear me out. This software is designed to run smoothly on any modern version of Windows. We're talking anything above Windows XP. So whether you're rocking Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11, you're good to go.

But what if you're a die-hard Mac user? Well, you've got a couple of options:

1. **Use a Windows Emulator**: Software like Parallels or Boot Camp can let you run Windows on your Mac.
2. **Use a Virtual Machine**: Programs like VirtualBox allow you to create a virtual Windows environment on your Mac.
3. **Borrow a PC**: Got a friend or family member with a Windows machine? Time to call in a favor!
4. **Use a Cloud PC Service**: Services like Shadow or Paperspace allow you to access a Windows PC via the cloud.

Remember, the key to success in business is adaptability. So don't let a little thing like operating systems stand between you and POD riches!

# Bonuses: The Icing on the Cake

Just when you thought this deal couldn't get any sweeter, along come the bonuses! Now, I can't spill all the beans (where's the fun in that?), but let me give you a little taste of what you might expect:

1. **Training Videos**: Rumor has it that there's a comprehensive set of training videos in the works. These will take you from POD newbie to puzzle-creating pro in no time.
2. **Marketing Materials**: Why reinvent the wheel? Word on the street is that you might get some pre-made marketing materials to help you sell your puzzle books.
3. **Additional Puzzle Templates**: While the software is awesome on its own, a little birdie told me there might be some extra puzzle templates thrown in as a bonus.
4. **PLR Content**: Need content to market your puzzles? There's a chance you might get some PLR articles about the benefits of puzzles for kids.
5. **Exclusive Facebook Group Access**: Imagine having direct access to other Brainy POD Generator users to share tips and tricks. That could be a game-changer!

Remember, these are just potential bonuses based on industry standards and whispers in the wind. The actual bonuses might be even better! The only way to know for sure is to grab your copy of Brainy POD Generator when it launches.

# Should You Use It? The Million Dollar Question

Alright, we've covered a lot of ground here. You've seen what Brainy POD Generator can do, how much it costs, and even peeked behind the curtain at who created it. But the big question remains: Should you use it?

Well, let me break it down for you:

**You should definitely use Brainy POD Generator if:**

1. You're looking to break into the POD market with a unique product.
2. You want to tap into the lucrative children's educational product niche.
3. You're a POD veteran looking to diversify your product line.
4. You love the idea of creating fun, educational content for kids.
5. You want a simple, user-friendly tool that doesn't require advanced design skills.
6. You're interested in not just creating products, but potentially reselling the software itself.

**You might want to think twice if:**

1. You're exclusively a Mac user and aren't willing to use Windows or a Windows emulator.
2. You're looking for a tool that creates a wide variety of puzzle types beyond Sudoku.
3. You're not interested in the children's product market at all.
4. You're not willing to put in any effort to market and sell your creations.

Here's my take: For the price of a few fancy coffees, you're getting a tool that could potentially launch a whole new business venture. Even if you only use it to create a few puzzle books as a side hustle, you could easily make your money back and then some.

And let's not forget the resale rights. Even if you decide the POD game isn't for you, you could still profit by selling the software to other entrepreneurs.

In my book, that makes Brainy POD Generator a pretty low-risk, high-reward investment. But hey, I'm just here to give you the facts. The final decision is up to you!

I feel terrible because around 6 months ago, my husband has informed me that since we had our first child almost three years ago, he has felt like an after thought in my life. And he‚Äôs right, my kids have been and will always be my soul focus in life, I can‚Äôt help it. Since he has told me this, I have arranged mumerous date nights away for just us, I make time for sex at least 3x a week, I make dinner and clean the house so there‚Äôs no work to be done when he gets home from work (I work overnights, so I sleep when he gets home from work). I try very hard to be spontaneous and surprise him with little things like a coffee when I get home or his favorite foods. I‚Äôve really thrown myself into trying to be the most loving wife I can because he deserves it, truly. He‚Äôs a wonderful loving dad. It seems like whatever I do, however, I just can‚Äôt seem to get it right. Yesterday, as he was telling me a story from work, my almost 3 year old was climbing on me and I interrupted him to tell her to stop. After I did that he refused to tell me the rest and told me how I am constantly doing that, and how I constantly will focus on anything other than him.

I broke up with my girlfriend two months ago, and the reason she gave was that there wasn‚Äôt an emotional connection anymore. Toward the end of the relationship, she said we felt more like friends, and she couldn‚Äôt see a future with someone who wasn‚Äôt emotionally connected. At first, I didn‚Äôt fully understand, but I‚Äôve spent time reflecting on my mistakes and realized where I went wrong. I admit I was selfish and didn‚Äôt listen to her needs.

A week ago, I sent her a heartfelt letter apologizing, acknowledging my mistakes, and letting her know I‚Äôd changed. We talked briefly after that, but she was really harsh and told me that even though I finally understood, it was too late and there was no future for us. When I asked if she had any feelings left for me, she said no. This is hard to believe since we were together for almost two years, and it feels like her feelings couldn‚Äôt have completely disappeared in just two months. It‚Äôs confusing because just a few weeks before we broke up, we went on a trip, and everything seemed fine, even though we did have some arguments. It feels like such a sudden shift.

Now, I‚Äôm stuck between wanting to move on and thinking maybe we could reconnect. Part of me wants to ask her to meet for coffee and have a deep conversation about everything‚Äîwhy we really broke up, if there‚Äôs any chance of starting fresh, or if I should just let it go. I don‚Äôt want to beg or come across as desperate, and I‚Äôve already said sorry in my letter, so I‚Äôm not sure what else I could say that I haven‚Äôt already.

At the same time, I love her deeply, and it‚Äôs hard to accept that things could just end like this. I know that even if we got back together, things wouldn‚Äôt be the same, but I still can‚Äôt help thinking about it. On the other hand, I‚Äôm worried that if I reach out again, it will seem like I‚Äôm stuck and can‚Äôt move on, which makes me feel like I‚Äôm lowering my self-worth. I‚Äôm also unsure if two months of change is enough for her to believe I‚Äôve grown or if she‚Äôs already moved on for good.

I‚Äôm torn between letting go and trying to reconnect, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I move on and focus on myself, or is it worth reaching out to her one more time?",1,1728299147.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1fy4uui,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeoulPlasticSurgery/comments/1fy4uui/ab_plastic_surgery_square_jaw_reduction_and/,[AB Plastic Surgery] Square jaw reduction and rhinoplasty,"So yes - I am post aggressive sawing of the chin and jaw towards the ‚ÄòV‚Äô-line, and a complete rhinoplasty.

In turn:

Why not Europe/Poland ?

My problem has always been sharp facial features (‚ÄòSchwarzeneger‚Äô jaw, wide rectangular face). Unfortunately, the sharp facial features were very incongruent with my character and personality which often caused cognitive dissonance in people. The nose was long, wide, bulbous with a drooping tip.

Europe and Poland immediately went for deletion. Surgeons in PL/Europe take cosmic money for very little bone reduction, too much stress on nerve connections and ageing processes. Noteworthy, however, are Dr Pokrowiecki in Warsaw and Dr van der Dussen at the 2pass clinic in Antwerp - I had consultations with both of them and they were both willing to do aggressive reduction, but unfortunately the fear of small changes won out and I opted for Asia.

Korea - for many years there have been testimonials floating around the internet of girls who came back from Korea with faces a'la barbie with perfect V-line facial shapes for a cool amount of money (12000-18000 USD ). This motivated me to choose this country as my destination for my square jaw reduction

3 Choosing a clinic

When choosing a clinic in Seoul, you need to be guided by reviews on Reddit and PurseForum. On Reddit, there is a red-flag list of clinics with incidents where surgeons don't saw anything on girls but take money for it. Also on the red-flag list is ID Hospital supposedly having experience of surgery in trannies. I had a choice between BT Plastic Surgery and AB Plastic Surgery. Interestingly both these clinics operate in the same high-rise building in Seoul :mrgreen: . My choice was AB Plastic Surgery for financial reasons- for giving permission to market the results of the surgery on instagram,Facebook, Googles and other places on the web, you get a maximum 50% discount on the surgery.

Online consultation, initial quote and flight

Contact to the clinic from the very beginning was via WhatsApp. The clinic, receiving 3 photos of my face, made an initial quote including a promotion. I booked an appointment for 2 September (consultation) and 3 September (surgery). Initially, in addition to the rhinoplasty and reduction of the jaw and chin, they also wanted to do liposuction of the chin.

My flight was on August 30th by LOT from Krakow with a stopover in Warsaw. Generally, the trip was difficult - turbulence every now and then, over China we had a strong rollercoaster, so much so that things fell off the shelves. Food 2/10, but I was so hungry from the stress that I swallowed everything. Seoul airport is very well signposted, and it's easy to go through visa check-in, pick up your suitcase and get on the bus.

Seoul

For me, it's a kind of futuristic Bangkok - a combination of Asian style straight out of manga and anime, with great innovation and developed technology on every level. My impression is as if one has arrived in a Japanese Manga and is 10 years ahead in the world. Transport in Seoul is a must with the T- Pay app, Google maps beat my Apple ones on my iPhone. Generally, the underground will get you to the clinic and many tourist attractions but be prepared for the maze of changing to other lines. With all this, there is a vibe of Mang and Anime at every turn :>

Day -1 (live consultation)

Medical staff speak poor English. Communication with surgeons was via AI translator on phones and it is best to immediately set the AI to Polish-Korean. The equipment in the clinic is some futuristic wonders straight out of a SciFi film. Nowhere have I seen such accurate craniofacial imaging in I was at one time in another Asian FFSow clinic. A 3D craniofacial CT scan, 3D head modelling and dental x-rays were carried out.

Overall, the nasal surgeon decided on a complete nasal reconstruction with intercostal cartilage, narrowing and shortening the nose, creating an upturned nose and connecting it in a gentle way to the forehead line (flat without an acute angle between the nose and forehead as I had before). The chin surgeon decided to file more than 10 mm of bone from the chin line, the chin angles and a genioplasty based on an osteotomy (excision) of the chin angles AND shortening the chin from below also by 10 mm. Liposuction was abandoned because it was felt that for maximum relief, the fat was better left there.

Day 0 (operation):

Surgery time 9:00am.The surgery was performed on me by a full team with two surgeons. After drawing lines on my face, changing into my surgery outfit and storing my clothes in my locker, I went to the operating room. I was put to sleep for a long time and all I remembered was being put on an oxygen mask with a sleeping agent and some voices telling me to open my eyes.

I will say this - the best anaesthetic of my life. Zero desire to vomit and no side effects. Mandatory lying on my back, hooked up to an opiate drip. I was informed that the operation was successful but was difficult due to the amount of bone that could be removed and the problems with taking it out through the mouth. Generally the cuts are inside the mouth. My nose already looks feminine and completely different despite the massive swelling

My whole face is swollen like a tomato. The AI face shape detectors on the phone already, despite the swelling, do not recognise a square/rectangular face shape - but a heart-shaped face.

Day +1

I was discharged from the clinic to a hotel, given medication (which is at an extra cost) and the drains were removed from the jaw and nose. While the removal of the nasal tubes was easy, I had two long tubes removed from my jaw that would not end :D ... normally I felt as if a huge bug was being removed. On my return to the hotel I managed to fall asleep for a maximum of 3 hours with the air conditioning on and directed at my face.

Day +2

I managed to finally recover completely despite my current food being the pap powder huel I bought before surgery. I had setons pulled from my nose which again was mega uncomfortable for me - feeling like they had pulled huge bugs out of my nose holes. A bandage was pulled off the front of my nose, I was given instructions on how to lubricate the suture lines and the entrance to my nose holes with ointment (paid extra at their pharmacy) , I was given guidelines on how to proceed so that the swelling went down and my nose healed nicely.

Included in the price of the operation, you have a radiofrequency session - and this is what I was given on the 2nd day after the operation to reduce the swelling.

For now, that's it - I can breathe through my nose, I'm eating pap smears, I'm fighting the huge swelling in my face and I'm already happy with the visible change in the shape of my face and my new nose - and I still have the bandages and the swelling so that already suggests that there has been an extreme change in my facial features.

Day +3:

My battle with swelling has begun. To this day I use the following rituals:

* 3 times a day I put on a compressor cooled in the fridge for 30 minutes. After 30 min break and put on again after 30 min for half an hour.
* drinking 2 bottles of two litres of still water a day
* mandatory daily walks
* no prepared food, fast food, sweets, energies (only coffee)
* mandatory sleeping on my back with my face upwards

After weaning off the opiates, my battle with pain began. The pains lasted all night - I slept for an hour max.

Day +7: Removal of bandage and face tourniquet. The entire jaw is completely swollen. The swelling is mainly marked by the ‚Äòhamsters‚Äô which gives the illusion (I hope :D ) that the face looks the same, however, with your fingers you can feel less jaw bone tissue and no angle of the jaw.

However, the worst part of the day was the removal of the medical dressing :D Unfortunately, it came to the surface how important it is to do an epilation before surgery. Removing the dressing was literally pulling a week's worth of dark stubble off my face xD. Then the crossing to the accommodation so as not to fall victim to strange looks because of the dark, week-old stubble on my face. And shaving - a chore! However, the next day the shaving with a razor went smoothly.

All the stitches from the nose were also removed that day.

It's hard to judge the effects at this point, as the whole face suffers from enormous swelling. The nose is narrower by a shorter amount than it was, but also swollen.

Day +9:

Physical fitness fully recovered, This is the first day since the operation that I have slept (today I finally slept 6h, previously I slept 2-3h max). Sleep is made more difficult by the fact of lying on my back and face up (while sleeping). Chewing pomarmov is a challenge. It takes me twice as long as usual to eat a meal that is not soup. And unfortunately the swelling continues - which unfortunately makes my face look the same as it did before the procedure - I pray that I am not doomed to a facelift when I return to PL because unfortunately at this point the bones are definitely less than the rest of the facial features.

This is evidenced by lifting the entire facial skin upwards with open hands - the face then looks like a perfect Korean V-line. In other words, the surgeon has stripped a piece of bone from the face and at this point the whole face hangs down. On top of this, if I lift my face upwards you can feel this cqla swelling moving across the face.

Day +16:

Pulled, and all sutures from the mouth and nose, last radiofrequency session and appointment with nose and chin&Jaw surgeons. Before and after effects visible on CT scans.

I have been slated for a full facelift in December at the earliest (3 months after surgery). The swelling is coming down and unfortunately there is excess skin and subcutaneous tissue (especially fascia). This was an acute and radical T-genioplasty and reduction of the jaw, therefore this skin and tissues are,e not going to form.

I recommend AB Plastic Surgery to everyone. The results in the form of CT scans and photos of the face before and after are huge. 

I am satisfied with the results of the operation and I can only wait until December for the full facelift that will crown the surgeon's wonderful work",1,1728298786.0,SeoulPlasticSurgery,1,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt have many preferences, I am very open minded, I just desire loyalty from a partner. Im your typical guy, I enjoy video games and movies. I work out often and hope to find someone who has the same drive to be a better version of yourself everyday. I am very understanding and enjoy talking about feelings n stuff. Chronic phone user so I won‚Äôt be missing any text. At this point I just desire for someone to occupy my free time and make something of it.

1fy4qvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1fy4qvt/an_essay_i_wrote_about_the_life_i_want_to_live_a/,"An essay I wrote about the life I want to live: A Life of Meaning, Purpose, and Happiness. My search for meaning.
","I have always questioned what life is all about, why we are here, and how I can live a fulfilling life. Were we just put here to suffer and then die? Many things happening in society just don‚Äôt make sense to me. I am appalled by society's moral decay, the death of family values, the craze for social media fame, likes, and subscriptions, the narcissism and materialism of the world, and the overall superfluity of life today. I just want a simple yet meaningful and fulfilling life. Like it‚Äôs the 80s or 90s: I want to fall in love and be loved.



Because:

*Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.*



At this point in my life, I have my priorities straight. I now know exactly what I want from life and what will bring me everlasting happiness. I love the simple things ‚Äî laughing, cooking, having home dinners with family and friends, helping others grow, mentoring, home parties with games, quiet moments to myself, in my thoughts, walks under the moonlit skies, a quiet evening at home, the gentle cuddles of a loving partner, watching the sunset, a good meal, a walk by the beach, and creating simple, sweet, unforgettable memories. I deeply enjoy the peace, comfort, and reassurance of being around a loving partner. That gentle reminder that this right here is home and nothing else matters but us and what we do and achieve together. No competition, no jealousy, no ego and pride, no anger or hate, no fears of losing each other, no ‚Äúme vs you‚Äù. Us.¬†



I dream of the whole package in life: Picture a small beautiful dream and cozy house with lots of space and a backyard, a family with adorable, happy, and well-raised kids running around, a happy beautiful wife, and overall, a beautiful, loving, and happy family, with lots of love and laughter. Growing old together. Ultimately, this is the most important and precious thing in life. This is a life worth living, far beyond pursuing wealth, status, titles, fame, etc. My family should be my priority and ultimate responsibility in every aspect and I want a woman who shares this mindset. I work hard but my hard work and ambition aren‚Äôt just to have money (I don‚Äôt need much money for myself, I don‚Äôt have many responsibilities, and I am not materialistic. Fancy things such as cars, jewelry, shoes, and clothes do not impress me). I aim to achieve financial freedom solely so I can have much more time with my family, provide a comfy life, afford a dream home with comfortable living spaces and beautiful play areas, and be able to eliminate the stress and tension that come with financial worries. Also, as a man, working hard and achieving goals adds meaning and purpose to my life. And I would love someone who encourages me with words of affirmation, even though I need to encourage myself more. I don't like just sitting around doing nothing. At the same time, pursuing financial freedom shouldn‚Äôt jeopardize quality family time or time with my loved ones. I want to have a traditional family unit with a modern twist. This means that I don‚Äôt expect my wife to do all the housework and childcare. I don‚Äôt want to just throw money at her and sit back. These are also my responsibilities. So it is normal to share house chores, cooking, and other such endeavors, especially if she has a career.¬†



I would love a partner to share love, comfort, memories, and life with. I want to have family breakfasts, enjoy family dinners, pick up my kids from school, cook dinner together with my woman while dancing in the kitchen, adore and appreciate my woman, and read bedtime stories to my children, I want to be that couple who hold each other in the living room and slowly dance to evening love songs, I want to cuddle her and kiss her neck as we dance, dance that very slowly turns intimate, with touching, kissing, and slow passionate lovemaking, with the background music still playing, just have pillow talk, and kiss my wife goodnight every day, I want to put up Christmas decorations with her and wrap our children‚Äôs gifts together. To go and countdown on New Year‚Äôs Eve while holding hands. I want to wake up every morning loving life without complaints, appreciating what I have, and thanking God for life. I want to train, nurture, and watch our beautiful children and someday hold my wife and share a cry of joy as we watch our babies fade into the sunset of adulthood and college, knowing that we raised them to be the best society can offer, capable of handling all that comes their way and trusting us to be there for them in the inevitable challenges of their teenage years. I want my wife to be my partner in crime. My most trusted confidant, whom I can rely on 100% to handle our affairs when I am not around and vice versa because I believe in her abilities and intelligence. She should be the one I run to for advice and counsel when I am stuck. She should be the one I count on to manage and advise on our finances and she will reign as queen over our affairs at home, with my healthy support, and be by me as I strive to put food on our table, and a shelter over our head and to provide and protect our household.



I want us to be that old couple walking down the street holding hands, sitting at the park feeding the pigeons, or helping each other pick groceries. I want to be that couple who still makes jokes at each other and laughs even in their 80s, who welcomes their children and grandchildren during Christmas and other holidays and have a blast telling them stories of their lives‚Äîthe same old stories they've already told a million times.



To achieve this, I need to trust my woman enough to completely lay down my guard, be myself, and be completely vulnerable and emotionally available. To listen to her needs love her dearly and always reassure her of this love. I need to learn to communicate better, uplift her, openly praise the great things about her, and support her endeavors. I need to seek help for any issues that might sabotage our relationship. And learn to set boundaries when I need them and respect her boundaries when they are set. I need to take action to make our relationship better: Buy her flowers, plan dates, organize fun events, prepare surprises, and do other things that show her how much I am committed to making our relationship grow and our bond stronger and bring liveliness to the relationship. She shouldn't carry all the burden of making our relationship work.



Family means the world to me, coming from what I think is one of the best families ever. I want to start my own and be an even better father and husband than my father was. He was the best father in the world. I draw inspiration from him and many father figures in my life. I want to be a dad, not just a father and I want to be a husband, I don‚Äôt want to just get married or have a wife. I want to contribute to the world by raising children with strong moral principles. Children who do not add to the suffering of the world but grow to be men and women of strong values. Who live a life that has depth in a world that is plagued by the constant pursuit of superficial things. A world full of deceit and evil. Who grow to be good people, worthy of respect and honor, and who treat others with dignity. Children that others will say of them, ‚ÄúYou are a good person‚Äù.



Finding the right person takes time, and I‚Äôm okay with that. Once I find someone reciprocating my love and who shares this vision, I will be locked in and will give her all the assurance she needs to feel secure and safe in our relationship. I will never let go when trouble comes but try to find solutions instead. I understand just how important open communication is in that difficult moment. I understand just how precious reassurance is to the peace and well-being of my woman. Not just verbal reassurance. Reassurance also shows through actions and even in day-to-day conversations. Referring to ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúour‚Äù, not ‚Äúme‚Äù and ‚Äúmy‚Äù when having discussions. Reassurance gives her the peace and comfort needed to stay happy and grounded in what we have. It also makes her feel that this right here is home for her and I am not going anywhere. It makes her free to let go knowing that I am hers and nothing will change. It takes away her anxiety and best of all, it makes me love her even more. She should never question her place and worth in my life. The best lessons are learned from bitter experiences.¬†



I do not find pleasure in wild adventures such as partying, clubbing, getting drunk cheap flings, or other things that complicate my life. I don‚Äôt smoke, do drugs, get drunk, or pursue casual intimacy, and I vow to myself to never cheat on my partner as this is one of the very few sins that I can't forgive in a relationship. I am also taking the time to understand my emotions and personality through reading, watching videos, and therapy so that I will be a well-rounded man who understands his mind, personality, and emotions and how to treat a woman the best way possible.



In a relationship, I know that I should be able to change certain habits or ways of doing things that my partner finds unappealing and I expect the same from her. However, I should accept them for who they are, not try to bend them to a version of themselves that they hate. I always envision a good couple building each other up in terms of personalities and habits. Such things should be communicated more romantically and affectionately in a way that uplifts her, makes her feel appreciated and loved, and strengthens our bond rather than in a critical manner.¬†



What makes me happy? Simple things like breakfast together, sharing tea or coffee in our home, goofy jokes, sharing silly memes, checking in and supporting one another (something I need to get better at), new experiences, thoughtful surprised gifts, the outdoors during sunny days, the indoors during stormy days, hanging out with family and friends, trips to natural destinations, sharing a home-cooked dinner with friends and family, having a sense of purpose, making a positive impact on those around me, passionate love-making, and treating others with respect and dignity.¬†



I love good food and enjoy cooking together with my woman with some background music. A movie night with popcorn, cuddled in a blanket - and being in that moment, not in my head, a competitive bowling session, and many such simple activities that build bonding and relaxation. I need to get out of my head more often, enjoy these present moments, and worry less about the future, and other things that I have no control over.¬†



I am learning to set and enforce boundaries when I need them to sort my thoughts and do so in a way that doesn‚Äôt leave my partner alienated or anxious about my commitment to her. I often felt like, setting boundaries was punishing my partner and cutting her off from myself. Like putting her in a cage and locking her away. Boundaries are very important for regaining one's composure and lead to clearer and better-thought-out communication. Because I saw boundaries as something bad, I was also terrible at respecting them because they felt like I was being exiled or cast away.¬†



I am financially stable with a good career. Beyond my job, I am working on other endeavors that I hope will someday generate income to supplement my salary and make me more financially free. I hope to keep building these, and hopefully, my efforts will pay off. I would love a partner who has hobbies and supports such endeavors, either by encouraging me or supporting me in other ways. Words of affirmation can go a long way.



The things I truly value are good moral principles, integrity (especially with money. I can't trust people whom I can't trust with money and I trust too easily), honesty, commitment (I demand more of this from myself too), and fairness ‚öñÔ∏è. I would like someone with similar values and principles. Many relationships today are centered around who makes more money, who has what, and couples actively planning how to get out of the relationship with the most shit. Who keeps the pet, owns the house, and has custody. These stories and accompanying vengeful behaviors make me feel hopeless sometimes, but there is hope. I want someone who doesn't care about things like this. Someone who's not planning an exit strategy, who is not overly materialistic and showy. Someone I can trust with my life's worth without fear of ending up on the streets or losing my kids. Someone who after the worst fight can still reconcile, laugh about it, and love each other even more. Not someone who holds grudges, is vindictive and always planning their revenge. Someone forgiving and who can apologize and ask for forgiveness. I'd forgive almost anything the first time if my partner explained themselves and asked for forgiveness.¬†



I hope she‚Äôs simply a good person who treats others with dignity, respect, and politeness, regardless of their social status or what they look like. I hate it when people look down on others. Someone who thanks the waiter for their service and helps the elderly or handicapped who are struggling or need help. Someone who tips the crippled by the road and makes friends with the stranger. Someone who sees the good in humanity and doesn't assume the worst of people.



The other quality I look for is someone who doesn‚Äôt buy into the idea of fairytale love like in Cinderella and the couples you see on social media. Those are not real. True love sometimes feels boring but still feels assured and safe. It is more calm and grounded in reality. It requires effort, initiative, and trust. Taking the initiative to do things that make us happy, have fun and bond more is something I have also failed at in the past. To organize date nights, and go out more for simple walks, to get rid of my phone and electronics during our time together, to find and play fun games, to be playful and goofy, not to take life too seriously, and not work so hard all the time, to go on road trips or weekends away, to lay my guards down, get out of my head and be present in all of this. I now know better from experience, my past failures, and therapy.¬†



True love fails sometimes and has flaws. It gets hard sometimes; picture a crying and sick baby, mental health issues, a sick partner, accidents, unforeseen disasters. Love goes through the storms without giving up. Sometimes, we fight and get at each others‚Äô throats and get nasty. Love is being able to beg for forgiveness and forgive and keep loving even more without holding grudges. It is supportive of each other, being there in the thick and the thin without giving up, it seeks solutions to problems not a way out. It is not distracted by external forces or influences, it praises and uplifts each other rather than criticizes. True love is holding hands and walking down the street together when we are old and gray - or bald in my case (I love seeing old couples together), dying together with a smile on our faces knowing that we gave it our all and overcame all the ups and downs.



In the end, I just want to fall in love. The old kind of love and live a simple, happy life away from all the chaos of cities, the madness of social media, and the confusion of modern society.



This will give my life the ultimate happiness, meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. It will be a life well lived and I‚Äôd die a happy man!!

Dax's raktajino is her last rebellious act, a last nod to the wild child who, after 356 years and eight lifetimes, is finally ready to grow up.

And those are just the beginning. There are plenty of times when a warm cup of peppery and cinnamon-laced coffee gives characters a chance to slow down, relax and bond together, both in their regular duties and as catalysts for a story. While raktajino may fuel as much of DS9's daily life as any ODN relay, it's also a window into the warm, rich heart of the series itself.""

Preface: I've briefly visited Utrecht for work and experienced Koningsdag in Zeist. Loved all of it.  
I now have the opportunity to organise a stag party for a friend this time next year.  
I'm aware of the perception that such a trip has with Nederlanders (we hate them in my town too). We're all in our 40s, we want to have fun and not interested in any kind of chaos.
As such, I want to avoid Amsterdam, but everything I find online is always Amsterdam centric.

With all that in mind, I'd like to know what you would all suggest for a weekend in the Netherlands that isn't in Amsterdam?  
Fun events/things to do?  
Places to visit?  
Rock/metal bars/clubs?  
Not fussed about coffee houses, though we're not averse to visiting one. 

Or perhaps there are places in Amsterdam that aren't particularly crowded/rowdy at that time of year? 

Hope this is all clear. Your opinions, help, or advice are welcomed, so thanks in advance.",1,1728298128.0,thenetherlands,1,0.57,False

About me:

Mostly sabi nila, I don't look 26. I look like 20-24 yrs old. Lagi din napag hinalaan na studyante. (Well studyante pnmn ako) I'm still studying because nagshift ng course, but I have a part-time job (WFH).

- 5'7

- Maputi, Neat, and Mabango

- Cute (Not sure, pero sabi daw nila)

- Naka salamin

- Average Body (Nag gym dati, pero na stop because busy sa school, other activity sa labas and + work pa)

- Lowkey lang, I'm not a social media person (But we can video call, If you want to see my face)

- Introvert, coffee lover, & chill guy 

- I love Games (MMORPG), Movies, Anime, Manga, and Music

- Not interested sending nudes, in messenger or other apps (Mahirap napo, baka kumalat, kaya ingat po tau lahat)

I'm a Christian guy & naging part ng KBS (Alam niyo ung feeling na need po magpa good boy kasi yun ung image na alam or nakikita nila sayo, nakakapagod dba? Like very frustrating. That's why I'm here‚Äîpara ma release at makawala nmn sa true self ko.

(Eto po hanap ko) Let's get straight to the point:

I'm only looking for one partner. I don't like third parties and makikipag talik kahit kanino. One is enough for me. I'm also very open, if may mga fantasies or fetishes ka na gusto mo itry, sabihin mo lang po sa akin, and we can talk about it. Like I said, gusto kodin mag explore and try to gain experience. Malay mo, ung mga fantasies or fetish mo, magustuhan kodin. As long as makipag communicate ka lang. If di ka na satisfied, wag kana mahiya, just tell me, and we can do another round, until I ma satisfied kita. (For me, that's the point ng meetup natin, to satisfied our sexual needs dba?)

I'm also respectful po. If you're not interested to me, or nakahanap kana ng mas better ka FUBU, just let me know, and we can end it. Ganun lang po ka simple. :)

So ayun lang po, I'm looking for a FUBU (Long-term sana), we can chat and share din nmn about life. We can also help each other, If gusto mo din ng kalandian, go lang din.

I‚Äôve been consistent with my debt payments, and this month I‚Äôm close to finishing my third one. It‚Äôs October now, and with my plan, I will finish by February or March. I‚Äôve been disciplined, followed restrictions, and it‚Äôs been rewarding.

That meant holding off on getting my AC fixed, repairing a cabinet, and buying proper furniture. Right now, I only have a table, a chair with a broken backrest, and a bed. I sold my nice furniture for extra cash.

This also meant holding off on wants, of course‚Äîtraveling, going out, and buying a gadget. (Okay, I only have a phone and a company laptop that I can‚Äôt use for personal things, and I want to get a Kindle.)

I was okay with this‚ÄîI thought of it as delayed gratification. It was rewarding to see credit cards get paid off, especially with all these significant sacrifices.

It‚Äôs already my eighth month with, you know, no furniture and all. It‚Äôs starting to get depressing. This month, I‚Äôll be able to pay off my third card.

I don‚Äôt know‚Äîthis lack of freedom is taking a toll on me. Every month, I don‚Äôt get to keep my money. It goes straight to interest. Skip the lecture‚ÄîI already know, and I‚Äôm learning the hard way. What I need, I guess, is encouragement. Has anyone felt this way? Like you‚Äôre going to break down at some point?

I‚Äôve been disciplined and responsible, but I‚Äôm starting to feel the weight of it more acutely. I feel trapped and restricted, unable to enjoy the fruits of my labor. I‚Äôve been enduring discomfort for over half a year, even trading off small pleasures like getting a Kindle.

I‚Äôve started going out lately to read books, just to get proper lighting. I spend a little to escape that depressing, empty house. I don‚Äôt even clean it because I hate it‚Äîmore like I hate that I can‚Äôt do anything about it right now. Some of my stuff are on the floor or in paper bags and boxes, no storage! How do I keep going with a house and a life like this?

I need to know what to do. I feel like I‚Äôm gonna snap and suddenly get a big purchase without thinking.

In February or March, I‚Äôll be able to pay it all off. This week, I‚Äôve just been feeling like, ‚ÄúCan I still go on with this setup?‚Äù This is the fastest way to pay it off. I‚Äôve been trying to distract myself, like reading my current books, but all that‚Äôs gotten me is going out to coffee shops (buying whatever is cheap) to get proper lighting to read‚Äîthen wanting a Kindle‚Äîthen realizing it should wait. That kind of cycle.

However, I can say this: with these restrictions, there‚Äôs also a feeling of freedom. If I can put 60% of my salary toward debt payments, I realize it‚Äôs possible for me to have that ‚Äúextra‚Äù money for myself once this is over.

Here‚Äôs some back story:   I manage an accounting team and the environment is very competitive and dynamic.  

 One day, a very strange chubby and ugly looking woman with blue hair and a lip piercing showed up at our office: it was our new recruit. 

She was the new entry level accountant. Her appearance threw me off, not gonna lie. 

However, since I‚Äôm a nice person, I decided to look past it. Sadly, she wouldn‚Äôt let me.   She walked in without greeting anyone except me (barely).   

During the days that followed, I could tell that something was wrong with her not only physically but mentally. She kept on getting distracted by the smallest things, wouldn‚Äôt talk to other coworkers etc. Long story short: her being there made the atmosphere even worse.   

As time went by, everyone, including me, started talking shit about her behind her back. It was pretty satisfying.   

I remember my assistant being like ‚Äúput some fucking makeup on, you look like a dog‚Äù.   

Not only that, but we‚Äôd make sure to make her work her ass off. So we‚Äôd assign everyone‚Äôs work to her. She had so much to do that she had to stay really late at the office all the time.
 
Later on, what we were doing escalated: we‚Äôd spill coffee on her on purpose, would make sure her computer malfunctioned, shame her during meetings etc.   

One day, I pulled her aside and asked: ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù   She started crying and replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm autistic‚Äù.  

 I told her that I wasn‚Äôt surprised at this point, but it was the cherry on top. 

So I looked at her right in that fat ugly face if hers and was like: ‚ÄúRosie, you‚Äôre fired. We can‚Äôt have a retarded person in our team as it will fuck our KPI and reputation‚Äù. I told her to grab her shit and to fuck off. I even had security escort her out to embarrass her.   

I didn‚Äôt even pay her last month because she didn‚Äôt deserve it.   

Since then, I‚Äôm stalking her LinkedIn everyday and will make sure she‚Äôs never employed anywhere.     ",0,1728297186.0,stories,6,0.28,False

I'm away camping in North West Wales. I've had a slow and lazy start to my day so far, just had a coffee, starting to perk up!

I watched them from a distance, leaning against the corner of the building just across the street from the caf√©. Isla had no idea I was there, no idea I‚Äôd followed her every step, her movements so predictable it was almost laughable.

But Wyatt‚Äîhe was the problem. I saw him inside, sitting across from her, leaning in like he was trying to get close, to comfort her. It made my skin crawl, seeing the way he smiled at her, the way he watched her. And what bothered me most was that she didn‚Äôt seem to notice. Or maybe she did. Maybe she was just pretending everything was fine.

But I knew better. I knew how to read Isla in ways she hadn‚Äôt even realized yet.

I could see it in the way she clutched her coffee cup, how her eyes darted toward the door, always on edge, like she was waiting for something‚Äîmaybe a sign, maybe an escape. And then Wyatt had said something, and she‚Äôd tensed up even more. I knew that look. She was uncomfortable. I had to stop myself from storming in and yanking him away from her.

But that wouldn‚Äôt do. Not yet.

I gripped the edge of my phone, tapping my fingers against the screen, waiting. I‚Äôd sent the text just as Wyatt leaned closer. The message had been timed perfectly. I wanted to see how she would react. And when Isla grabbed her phone and her face went pale, I knew it had worked. She was spooked, just as I wanted her to be.

I didn‚Äôt need her trusting Wyatt. That wasn‚Äôt part of the plan.

From where I stood, I could see Wyatt‚Äôs smile falter as Isla looked down at her phone. He didn‚Äôt know what had just happened, didn‚Äôt realize that every step he took toward her was another misstep I‚Äôd orchestrated. She was pulling away from him‚Äîjust like I needed her to.

I could tell Wyatt was trying to salvage the conversation. He kept leaning in, that fake grin plastered on his face, but Isla was distracted. The tension between them was clear, even from where I stood. She wasn‚Äôt engaged in whatever he was saying. She was somewhere else. With me.

It felt good‚Äîsatisfying‚Äîto watch Wyatt squirm. To see that he didn‚Äôt have the control he thought he had. Isla was slipping away from him, bit by bit, and soon, she‚Äôd be right where she needed to be. Away from him, away from the distractions.

I slipped my phone out of my pocket again and pulled up Alex‚Äôs number. She had done a good job feeding me what I needed on Wyatt, but there were still too many unknowns. I didn‚Äôt like not knowing everything about him.

It took a couple of rings before Alex picked up, her voice chipper like she‚Äôd been waiting for my call.

‚ÄúWell, look who it is. Checking in on your project again?‚Äù she teased.

‚ÄúCut the crap, Alex,‚Äù I muttered, keeping my voice low. ‚ÄúYou were right about Wyatt, but I need more.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, do you now? What‚Äôs got you all worked up this time?‚Äù

I glanced back at the caf√©, watching as Wyatt stood up, getting ready to leave. Isla stayed in her seat, her eyes staring off into the distance. Good. She needed space from him.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust him. There‚Äôs more going on with him, and I need to know what it is.‚Äù

Alex sighed, but I could hear the sound of her typing on a keyboard. ‚ÄúAlright, alright. I‚Äôll dig deeper. But you know this guy‚Äôs no criminal mastermind, right? I mean, he‚Äôs got a temper, sure, but there‚Äôs no grand conspiracy here. He‚Äôs just another guy.‚Äù

Another guy who‚Äôs getting too close to Isla. That‚Äôs what she didn‚Äôt understand. It wasn‚Äôt about whether Wyatt had a record or a dark past. It was about how easily he was slipping into Isla‚Äôs life, like he belonged there. Like he had a right to her.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt see the whole picture,‚Äù I muttered, glancing back at the caf√© as Wyatt stepped out. He didn‚Äôt notice me. He was too wrapped up in whatever was going on in his own head.

‚ÄúOh, enlighten me,‚Äù Alex said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so special about this one? You‚Äôve gotten rid of guys before. What makes him different?‚Äù

I watched as Wyatt walked down the street, his posture stiff, clearly frustrated. Good. I wanted him uncomfortable. I wanted him rattled.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs trying too hard,‚Äù I said, my tone clipped. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs playing the long game with her, and I‚Äôm not going to let him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, just don‚Äôt do anything stupid. You‚Äôve got her wrapped up in enough already, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

I hung up before she could say anything else, slipping the phone back into my pocket. Alex never understood. She didn‚Äôt see what I saw. She didn‚Äôt know how deep this went.

I waited a few minutes before moving again. Isla was still inside the caf√©, staring into her cup like she was trying to piece together everything that had just happened. The text I sent had hit her harder than I expected, and I was curious how she‚Äôd handle it now. She was getting closer, closer to the truth, but I needed to keep her balanced on the edge‚Äîclose enough to see danger, but far enough that she‚Äôd turn to me when it all came crashing down.

I made my way down the street, taking a long way around so she wouldn‚Äôt notice me if she decided to leave. Everything had to be calculated, every step leading her away from Wyatt, away from whoever else thought they had a chance.

As I walked, I thought about what Alex had said. She didn‚Äôt understand, but she was right about one thing‚ÄîI‚Äôd dealt with guys like Wyatt before. They were always too confident, thinking they could waltz into someone‚Äôs life and claim territory that wasn‚Äôt theirs. But Isla wasn‚Äôt just someone to Wyatt. She was a game, a challenge. He wanted to fix her, to be the one who swooped in and saved the day.

But Isla didn‚Äôt need saving from him.

I slowed my pace as I approached her building. I hadn‚Äôt been inside in a few days, and I had to fight the urge to go in, to make sure everything was still in place. I knew her apartment as well as she did‚Äîbetter, even. I had been in and out enough to know every detail. But I couldn‚Äôt slip in just yet. She‚Äôd notice something was off, and I couldn‚Äôt afford to lose the control I had over the situation.

For now, I‚Äôd watch. I‚Äôd wait.

I needed Isla to come to me, to see Wyatt for what he really was. Once she did, everything would fall into place. She‚Äôd have no one else to turn to but me.

1fy4bdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_crimsondrafts/comments/1fy4bdv/chapter_17/,Chapter 17 ,"The afternoon dragged on, each minute slower than the last. I tried to distract myself‚Äîcleaning the apartment, scrolling through social media, half-watching a movie‚Äîbut nothing worked. The weight of everything pressed in on me, making it hard to breathe, hard to think.

Wyatt‚Äôs message still sat unanswered on my phone. I stared at it for what felt like the hundredth time, my thumb hovering over the screen, unsure if I should reply or not. He had been nothing but kind to me since we met, but now, every interaction felt like it had layers I hadn‚Äôt noticed before.

He‚Äôs not who you think he is.

The warning rang in my head again, louder this time. It echoed through my thoughts, mingling with my doubts, my fears. What if Wyatt was playing me? What if he‚Äôd been manipulating me this whole time?

But then again, why would he? What could he possibly gain from it?

I sighed, tossing my phone onto the couch. I couldn‚Äôt keep going in circles. Paranoia had already sunk its claws into me, and I needed to clear my head.

Without thinking, I grabbed my jacket and keys, deciding that maybe fresh air would help, or at least being outside where I wasn‚Äôt so trapped with my own thoughts.

As soon as I stepped onto the street, the world felt sharper, more immediate. The city buzzed around me‚Äîpeople moving quickly, cars honking in the distance‚Äîbut it felt distant, like I was walking in a haze. My apartment was suffocating, but out here, I didn‚Äôt feel any safer.

I headed toward the caf√© where Violet and I used to meet for writing sessions, a place that was always busy enough to offer anonymity but cozy enough to make you feel like you belonged. Maybe sitting with a coffee in hand, surrounded by people who didn‚Äôt know my name, would bring some normalcy back.

I walked briskly, my hands shoved deep in my pockets, but no matter how fast I moved, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, it felt like someone was there‚Äîjust out of sight. I told myself it was my imagination, but my pulse didn‚Äôt slow down.

The caf√© came into view, and I almost sagged with relief. The warm glow from inside, the smell of coffee and baked goods‚Äîit was familiar, grounding. I pushed open the door and ordered something, my mind still spinning, still trying to make sense of everything.

I found a seat near the back, far from the windows, where I could see everyone coming and going. As I sat down, I caught my reflection in the glass wall behind me. Tired eyes, disheveled hair, a woman on the verge of unraveling.

I needed to get a grip. I couldn‚Äôt let the fear take over. I couldn‚Äôt keep doubting everyone.

And then I saw him.

Wyatt.

He was standing near the entrance, scanning the room, and when his eyes landed on me, his face lit up with that easy, friendly smile I used to find so charming. But now it felt off, like I was seeing it through a filter of suspicion.

What was he doing here? Had he followed me?

I froze, unsure whether to wave him over or pretend I hadn‚Äôt noticed him. But it was too late. He was already walking toward me, his movements calm, relaxed, like this was just a coincidence.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, sliding into the seat across from me. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect to see you here.‚Äù

I forced a smile, trying to hide the unease crawling up my spine. ‚ÄúYeah, just needed to get out of the apartment for a bit.‚Äù

He nodded, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúI get that. It‚Äôs good to clear your head sometimes.‚Äù

His voice was casual, his posture relaxed, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the tension sitting between us. I could feel his eyes on me, like he was studying me, waiting for something. I hadn‚Äôt responded to his text, and now here he was, showing up out of nowhere.

Had he known I‚Äôd be here?

‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôs everything?‚Äù he asked, taking a sip from his coffee cup as though this were any other day. ‚ÄúYou seemed a bit off the last time we talked.‚Äù

Off didn‚Äôt begin to cover it. I‚Äôd been spiraling for days, and now, sitting across from Wyatt, I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was being paranoid or if the warning about him was real. But I couldn‚Äôt ignore the fact that it felt like he was watching me too closely, noticing every flicker of discomfort, every hesitation in my words.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve just been busy,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice light. ‚ÄúA lot of work stuff.‚Äù

Wyatt smiled, but it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúYou know, you can talk to me. If there‚Äôs anything bothering you.‚Äù

I forced another smile, but it felt stiff, unnatural. ‚ÄúThanks, I appreciate it.‚Äù

The conversation was strained, and I could feel the tension building with every second that passed. Wyatt wasn‚Äôt being aggressive or pushy, but something about him felt‚Ä¶ wrong. Like there was more going on beneath the surface.

I glanced at my phone, desperate for a distraction, when it buzzed with a new message. My heart skipped a beat, and I quickly grabbed it, my stomach tightening with dread.

Another text from the unknown number.

Unknown number: Don‚Äôt let him get too close.

My breath caught in my throat. I could feel Wyatt watching me, waiting for me to react, but I couldn‚Äôt look at him. I couldn‚Äôt let him see the fear creeping into my expression. I quickly locked the phone and shoved it back into my pocket, my mind racing.

Was this just a coincidence? Or had the person sending me these messages been watching us?

I couldn‚Äôt focus. Wyatt‚Äôs voice became background noise as he kept talking, asking questions I barely registered. I nodded along, giving vague answers, but my mind was somewhere else. Somewhere darker.

‚ÄúI was thinking,‚Äù Wyatt said, snapping me back to reality, ‚Äúmaybe we should grab dinner sometime. Get away from all the noise, you know?‚Äù

My pulse quickened. His words sounded innocent, but now, after everything, I couldn‚Äôt help but hear the layers beneath them. I was being irrational. I was jumping to conclusions. But the text‚Äîthe warning‚Äîit felt too specific, too real.

I smiled weakly, trying to mask my anxiety. ‚ÄúMaybe. I‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù

Wyatt‚Äôs eyes flickered with something I couldn‚Äôt quite place‚Äîdisappointment? Annoyance? But it was gone in an instant, replaced by his usual laid-back demeanor.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said, standing up and finishing his coffee. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a stranger.‚Äù

He left the caf√©, but even after the door swung shut behind him, the tension lingered. I stared at the spot where he‚Äôd been sitting, my heart still racing, my hands shaking. The text had rattled me, but what scared me more was the possibility that Wyatt was exactly what the message said he was.

Not who I thought.

But then again, maybe that was the plan all along. To make me doubt everything. To make me question everyone in my life until I was completely isolated, completely vulnerable.

I didn‚Äôt know who to trust anymore. Wyatt. The messages. Even Violet.

I was starting to feel like I was losing my grip on reality.",1,1728296551.0,u_crimsondrafts,0,1.0,False
