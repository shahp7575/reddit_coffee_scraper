1j2dxb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j2dxb8/aitah_for_standing_up_to_my_boyfriends_racist/,AITAH for standing up to my boyfriend’s racist sister after she called me a dirty white devil?,"I (17 f) and my boyfriend (20 m) have been together for almost a year now and ever since him and I have gotten together his whole family has had a problem with me being white, my boyfriends family is Afghani and usually go by strict rules about their Muslim religion more specifically Shia Muslim. At the beginning him and I were planning to keep our relationship a secret for a few years but his parents went through his phone and found out about us and wanted to meet me, when I met his parents they made us get “engaged” to be married right away and planned a formal engagement ceremony for when I turn 18. After that they welcomed me into their home and asked for me to come and stay for the weekends at his place and were completely fine with it up until his oldest sister (28 f) started feeding his mother and father false information about how he’s going to jail for being with me since I’m under 18, but in my country legal age of consent with any age is 16. When we cleared that up with his parents his sister ended up running away because she couldn’t feed her parents lies anymore and she wanted to live the life of a woman that use’s and sleeps with men for money. 

After that incident I was at his house on one really hot day and he asked if I could walk to the store and grab some things, so I put on a modest pair of shorts that barely went above my knees as well as a baggy T-shirt and walked outside. While I was outside I saw his older but younger sister (26 f) getting out of her car to come visit their parents after dropping her husband off at his family’s house. As soon as I saw her I politely smiled, said hello and asked if she would like anything from the store, she gave me a shocked dirty look and said no. I accidentally forgot my wallet in the house and as I went to grab it his sister started screaming at me telling me that I’m a dirty whore for wearing such provocative things out in public and how her brother should be disgusted with me for obviously seeking attention from other men, before this I asked my boyfriend if what I was wearing was okay and he said yes. As she was yelling at me I kept apologizing over and over again saying that I would change and that I didn’t mean to offend her in any way but she kept throwing insults at me. Their parents got involved after a few minutes telling her that what I was wearing was appropriate and for her to stop, as she was busy with her parents and my boyfriend I went to go change but she chased after me saying that her brother didn’t need to be with a dirty whore like me and then left the house. 
A week later I sent her a message that read this. “Hello (insert name) its (insert name) I just wanted to send you a message because I really thought we got off on the wrong foot and I don’t want to leave everything like that. I am sorry if I offended you and your family by what I was wearing and I’m not going to make any excuses for myself because now I understand that I shouldn’t wear things like that in front of your family and especially in front of your brother, it was very inappropriate of me to do that and for it I apologize. But I don’t want us to be on edgy terms with each other and I’d really like to get to know you and for you to get to know me, so if you ever just wanted to sit down and talk with me I’d be super happy to do that with you and you and I can go grab a coffee and have a one on one chat and just have a girls day with each other. I know you are super busy with work but I’d really like for you to get to know what kind of person I am, but until then I hope you have a wonderful week!” She replied to me saying “Hey (insert name) Thanks for your message, I also apologize, perhaps I may have overreacted. Let’s do that someday! Until then, take it easy and work hard in school!”

After this I’ve seen her multiple times at their parents house and I have always been nothing but kind and respectful to her and her family and thought that we were getting on good terms. But today my boyfriend received this message “ Can you please save our family’s reputation and leave (my name)? You’re going to destroy our family’s name. If you continue to be with her I will never speak to you again.” “(My boyfriend) why can’t you just be happy for me? She has done nothing to you all but be generous and kind.” “(Sister) she is useless, she doesn’t help mom at home, doesn’t clean or cook, and sits around all day like a bum. Not even studying in school, will not even be able to afford a life. She’s just a problem, and especially your going to make mom and dad so ashamed they’re not even going to be able to show their faces out in public because you are with that dirty white girl.” “(My boyfriend) You don’t even know what she does during the week. She’s top of her class, she takes care of her sick grandmother, and on top of that she cooks, cleans, and does almost everything. She’s even taking a course to learn our language and culture to convert” “(sister) If you are that selfish I am disgusted with you. Tell her to stop coming over until she gets her life together, gets a job and is your wife. You should be ashamed of yourself.” “(My boyfriend) She’s comfortable enough to come here and relax with us from all the hard work she does at home. You are the selfish one for looking down on her when you have made no effort in getting to know who she is or what she does.” “(Sister) you cannot even call yourself a Muslim. You are sleeping in the same room and hugging each other I am disgusted to even call yourself my brother. Shame on you, you should be ashamed of yourself for even having the blessed name of Mohammad you don’t even deserve it.” “(My boyfriend) She loves me and I love her and I have never found that with any of the girls mom and dad forced me to talk to, all they care about is money. (My name) is kind and has always been there for me when none of you were so no I am not ashamed to love the most amazing and resilient woman I have ever had the pleasure to come across.” “(Sister) she is disgusting. Look at her dirty white devil skin, I am disgusted every time I see that slut little white girl. She isn’t worthy enough to even breathe our air” “(my boyfriend) how dare you speak of my future wife that way. She has been nothing but kind to you when she had every reason not to. She has done everything we have asked of her and is an angel from our god.” “(Sister) she was not born Muslim so therefore she is a dirty white devil. She is scum on the earth for even existing.” “(My boyfriend) how is she scum in her own country. How dare you have the audacity to even speak of her this way, after this you are no longer part of my life. Goodbye.” 

Here is where I might be the AH. After my boyfriend showed me this conversation I took it upon myself to send her a message personally and this is what I said. “I get that you don’t like me and think I’m a disgrace to your family but I love your brother whether you can see that or you can’t , just because I am white does not define who I am as a person. I could be black, asian, Mexican, Indian, or Afghani, and I would still be the same person I built myself up to be today. All I wanted was a sister in law that I could go out for coffee with or go shopping with and now we cannot have that because all you see is my white skin. I respected you as his sister but now I cannot respect you as a person at all because it is completely racist to hate someone based off of their skin colour. I have been nothing but kind to you and your family and I have respected your rules. You are the most disgraceful and racist human being I have ever come across and as of now you are below nothing to me and (boyfriend’s name). You want to talk about human scum take a look in the mirror and then go shove it.”

I hope you’re all well. I’m here kindly asking if anyone around Arusha is soon flying back to the USA (Indiana) or Italy, or even knows someone who is. I run a small, local coffee roasting business here, and I’ve been trying so hard to share our premium, traditionally roasted Kilimanjaro coffee with a few friends abroad who really want to taste authentic Tanzanian beans.

But honestly, the process of shipping even small amounts like 400 grams from Tanzania has become such a nightmare. The postal costs are insanely high, and on top of that, there are so many bureaucratic restrictions and expensive export licenses just to send a simple gift. It’s really disheartening how our own government gatekeeps local farmers and small roasters from exporting what should be a proud, shared piece of Tanzanian culture. You’d think we’re trying to smuggle gold the way they make things complicated.

And yet, this is something that helps promote our country, supports small businesses, and shares the beauty of Tanzanian coffee with the world. But somehow, we’re locked out unless we can afford fees meant for massive exporters.

So here I am humbly asking, if you or someone you know is traveling soon from Arusha to the USA or Italy, and wouldn’t mind helping me out by carrying 400g of coffee in your luggage and posting it once you arrive I would be extremely grateful. I’ll handle the costs of local postage from there, of course. And as a small thank you, I’d love to gift you your own 400g bag of our best roast to enjoy as well.

If this speaks to you or you can help, please DM me. You’d really be helping na Asante sana.",1,1740989555.0,tanzania,1,1.0,False
1j2dvz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1j2dvz2/best_nonmono_ingredient_spreads_role_compression/,Best non-mono ingredient spreads - Role Compression for the strongest recipes,"Hi all, I recently made a post about how ABA Blastoise / ABA Clodsire / AAC Vikavolt could handle Clodsire Eclaires, the strongest recipe, with only 3 Pokemon, freeing up a team slot for a pot-up or tasty chance mon without having to keep swapping your mono-ingredient mons in and out. It got some discussion going around what non-mono ingredient spreads could become ""meta"", so I decided to calculate what the ""optimal"" ingredient finders and spreads would be for each of the strongest recipes - ""optimal"" meaning, the fewest Pokemon needed to consistently make the recipe 3 times a day.

The production rates were calculated using Raenox, assuming lvl 60 and Pokemon with IFM and IF+ nature (a reasonably good ingredient finder, but not god-roll level). An \* means the pokemon needs either an IFS or HSM subskill on top of IFM/IF+ to produce enough. A \*\* means it needs either both IFS/HSM, or one of them and 2xHB on the team to produce enough.

Note that I am absolutely not saying that if you have a mono-ingredient mon, that it is bad or sub-optimal. In fact, having great mono-ingredient mons are more future-proof, since we don't know what new recipes will be released and what ingredients will be needed in what proportions. I am saying that, if you happen to have one of the non-mono ingredient spreads I mention here, and it has great stats, that you should absolutely use it!

Below I have the tables of all of the strongest recipes, requirements, what pokemon and spreads are needed. My recommendations from this analysis are as follows:

**Mono-ingredient recommendations**:

Ginger (**Tyrannitar**), Eggs (**Delibird**), Honey (**Venusaur/Pinsir**), Leeks (**Quaquaval**), Apples (**Skeledirge**).

For all of these, there is little synergy between the primary ingredients and what else they can find.

For all other ingredients, there are recipes when non-mono ingredient spreads are better.

**Specific Pokemon that benefit from non-mono ingredient spreads:**

**Golem:** I believe Soybean/Soybean/Mushroom is the optimal spread for Golem, if you can find a nearly god-roll one. Mushrooms are present in every strong recipe soybeans are in, and mushrooms are in general much harder to farm. In both recipes here (HP Stew, Ninja Salad), Soybean/Soybean/Mushroom is going to role compress beautifully, and there are no recipes currently where you need an AAA soybean Golem.

**Aggron vs. Vikavolt**: I believe Aggron is the better investment for a ""mono""-Coffee farmer. ABB (Sausage/Coffee/Coffee) Aggron covers coffee in Defiant Salad and helps with sausage, and will easily handle the coffee requirements in any other recipe. Meanwhile, ABA (Coffee/Mushroom/Coffee) Vikavolt can help your mushroom farmer in Hidden Power Stew, and AAC (Coffee/Coffee/Honey) can solo-carry the honey and almost all the coffee in Clodsire Eclaire - if I had to recommend one, I'd recommend ABA Vikavolt as honey is easier to find a good farmer for than mushrooms, but both ABA and AAC have definitive niches.

Tomato farmers: Victreebel, Luxray, and Abomasnow all perform similary for AAA tomatoes. Given this, **Victreebel** should be ABA (tomato/potato/tomato) to cover both tomato/potato in greengrass salad. **Luxray** is probably the best AAA Tomato farmer, as **Abomasnow** is harder to farm and may also be better as ABB (tomato/egg/egg) as your egg farmer since Delibird is hard to find.

**Toxicroak**: You don't need all the oil from a AAA toxicroak. AAB (oil/oil/sausage) is ideal, since you'll generate enough oil for anything that needs it, and you also generate most of the sausage for Defiant Salad as a bonus.

**Charizard**: ABA (Sausage/ginger/Sausage) is best to cover Inferno Keema Corn Curry, letting you cover IKCC with just it and an ABA (Herb/Corn/Herb) Dragonite! Even if you only use it for sausage farming, ABA produces enough sausage, so having the ginger helps it role-compress for the curry.

**Cramorant**: Oil/Potato/Potato is the best, it makes the potatoes for Defiant salad and helps out with the oil, with tasty chance to boot. And like Toxicroak, no recipe needs the output from a triple oil one.

**Blastoise**: I recommend ABA (Milk/Cocoa/Milk) Blastoise. No recipe requires so much milk that you need AAA, and milk/cacao have such amazing synergy in dessert weeks and primary cacao farmers often need some help to keep up.

**Dragonite**: I never know what to think about this mon. It's a godly herb farmer but no recipe requires that many herbs. ABA (Herb/Corn/Herb) is probably best to cover the herbs and the corn for Inferno corn curry. However, if you want to use it for oil farming, ABC (Herb/Corn/Oil) is actually probably best? Since then it can cover both oil and corn for Greengrass salad, and oil/herbs aren't used together? So I'd rank Dragonite ingredient spreads, ABA > ABC > AAC, with AAA being a big question mark until they release a recipe that requires >90 herbs per day.

Talk about a digital coffee rush! The last time we saw this kind of action was back on December 16, 2024, when $BTC was soaring at $105,000. Now, traders are keeping their eyes peeled for what could be a game-changing shift in the market.

On the flip side, the market is teetering on the brink of capitulation. With Bitcoin dipping below $84,000, there's chatter about potential liquidations surpassing a whopping $1 billion. Don't panic just yet, as history shows that these dramatic sell-offs often foreshadow a market bottom—think of it as a rollercoaster ride where the plunge often leads to a thrilling ascent.

The surge in active addresses indicates that more folks are shuffling their $BTC around, possibly in response to those wild market swings. Whether this is a sign of impending gains or just a reshuffling of the deck, one thing is for sure: it's a trend to watch closely.

Bitcoin's Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score has also dropped to 2.01, hinting that we're nearing oversold territory. While this doesn't guarantee a rally, it’s a key metric that traders often consider when gauging future price action. 

Moving forward, the $80,500 support level is crucial. Hold above this, and we might see a stabilization. However, if we dip below $84,000 again, expect the pressure to ramp up—game on! All eyes are on the next few days to see if $BTC can find a bottom or if we’re in for more rollercoaster drops.

So strap in, the crypto world is as unpredictable as ever, but with uncertainty comes opportunity.

We met at a job we both had before we moved into our current careers and we don't work together anymore.

We were close when we worked together. She always asked me to walk her to her car cause she felt safe with me. I knew a lot of her background and we trusted each other with our own issues. We stayed in contact even though she moved to another state. We both travel for work and we always make a point to get lunch together whenever we intersect or are in the other's hometown.
 
Over the past few years, we've seemed to have gotten really close. We barely go more than a day without talking. If we do, she has been clingy and has thought I blocked her or that I was mad. 

What's weird is that she has a long-term boyfriend who moved to be with her but left his child at home with his parents to be with her. She's only ever expressed she's frustrated he hasn't proposed. By the way, I only know about the boyfriend abandoning his kid because I know his parents and they made some comments that were negative about their relationship and her because she's younger than him and they said ""something is off about her"" even though they also said they love her.

She's gotten really into the booktok craze and shares the books with me. Which my friends all said is very weird and have said she's trying to get me to date her. Even had a few disagreements lately and everyone says these are ""relationship not friendship"" fights. Especially the friends who are married. Because the issues I have are valid but somehow it's my fault anyway. They said I'm being treated like a boyfriend.

My family also said it's very weird, and when I brought this up to my therapist recently. He kept pausing and stopping what he'd wrote or when he'd drink his coffee. He said, there's clearly something there and it isn't all in my head. He's also encouraged me to bring up what I know about her boyfriend's kid and the family. Also to bring up the dynamic we have evolved into.

But I don't think the first part is my business and I don't think I should be bringing things like that up. But I've literally felt like I'm in a relationship with her because of the constant communication, the needs for reassurance and communication and how everything is my fault and I have to adapt to her needs.

Everyone in my family seems to have perfect digestion while being able to eat anything they want and I’m the only one this way. Have come to realize life is just unfair for some people, unfortunately 🫠

I’ve been having extremely hard stool and going every 3-4 days (max twice a week) for the longest time, but here’s what has helped me get it to every alternate day! (Still not ideal, I’m aware. But I will take what I can get).

1. **Hydration**- with a caveat though- water did not actually help at all. All it did was make me wanna pee constantly. I was drinking 2-3L every day and never felt hydrated in the least. What actually seems to hydrate me is fruit juices. Just plain fresh, no added sugar fruit juice. Particularly watermelon juice seems to do it. This doesn’t help with motility/stimulation necessarily but it does make my stools softer. 

2. **Not holding it in** -for chronic constipation sufferers, we usually don’t have a pattern/schedule with when we go. Which means you could get the urge in public places too. JUST GO. I know you prefer to poop at home, we all do. But holding it in till you get home will only make you more constipated. If you can find even a slightly clean public restroom, get some seat-sanitizing spray and *please just go*. 

3.**Spirulina** -just works for me. It’s probably the magnesium but I don’t question it either way. Added in smoothies/juices usually helps stimulate a movement. 

4. **Eating clean**- horrified to report this really does work. By clean I don’t mean fat free/low carb. Just clean, try to eat less packaged food and more fruits/veg/salad/stuff that’s good for your body. I used to think this was bs but I have noticed an immediate effect with bowel movements the next time if I eat terribly. Eating fast food will literally push it to 2-3 days later than usual. 


**What didn’t work for me**- probiotic supplements (and before someone says you need to take it with prebiotics, yes I did. Have tried practically every pill under the sun and not one has worked), green tea (makes me nauseous), kimchi, sauerkraut, coffee (helps to stimulate *rarely* but generally doesn’t help at all), senna, figs, mild laxatives.

Bitterness in coffee often surprises many. It’s a common issue that affects the taste and experience of your brew. The causes of bitterness range from the type of beans used to the brewing method. Over-roasting beans can lead to a burnt taste, while over-extraction during brewing can also contribute.

Factors like water temperature and grind size play a crucial role too. By understanding these factors, you can adjust your coffee-making process and enjoy a smoother, more balanced cup. This guide will dive into the details, helping you pinpoint and fix what might be making your coffee bitter.

# Sources Of Bitterness

Bitterness in coffee is a common issue for many coffee lovers. Understanding the sources of bitterness can help improve the taste of your coffee. Two main factors contribute to this bitterness: the coffee beans and the brewing water.

# Coffee Beans

The type of coffee beans you use significantly affects the bitterness of your coffee. There are several factors to consider:

* **Roast Level:** Darker roasts tend to be more bitter. This is because the roasting process breaks down the beans’ sugars and creates bitter compounds. Medium or light roasts usually have a more balanced flavor.
* **Bean Quality:** Low-quality beans often contain more defects. Defects can lead to a bitter taste. Always choose high-quality beans for the best flavor.
* **Freshness:** Freshly roasted beans are less likely to be bitter. Over time, coffee beans lose their flavor and become stale. Stale beans can taste bitter.

Here is a simple table to illustrate the impact of these factors:

|Factor|Impact on Bitterness|
|:-|:-|
|Roast Level|Darker roasts are more bitter|
|Bean Quality|Low-quality beans are more bitter|
|Freshness|Stale beans are more bitter|

# Brewing Water

The water you use for brewing also plays a critical role in the bitterness of your coffee. Here are some key points:

* **Water Temperature:** Hot water extracts more bitter compounds from the coffee grounds. The ideal temperature is between 195°F and 205°F (90°C – 96°C).
* **Water Quality:** Hard water contains more minerals, which can make your coffee taste bitter. Use filtered or soft water for a smoother taste.
* **Brewing Time:** Over-extraction occurs when coffee grounds are in contact with water for too long. This can lead to a bitter taste. Aim for a brewing time of 4-5 minutes for most methods.

Here is a simple table to illustrate the impact of these factors:

|Factor|Impact on Bitterness|
|:-|:-|
|Water Temperature|Too hot increases bitterness|
|Water Quality|Hard water increases bitterness|
|Brewing Time|Longer time increases bitterness|

By understanding these factors, you can make adjustments to reduce the bitterness in your coffee. Choose the right beans and pay attention to your brewing water to enjoy a better cup of coffee.

# Chemical Compounds

Introduction paragraph about What Makes Coffee Bitter and Chemical Compounds…

# Caffeine

Caffeine is one of the main compounds in coffee that contributes to its bitterness. **Caffeine is a natural stimulant** found in coffee beans. It gives coffee its energizing effects. But caffeine has a bitter taste. This bitterness comes from its chemical structure. It interacts with taste receptors on the tongue, signaling the brain to perceive a bitter taste.

Here are some key points about caffeine’s role in coffee bitterness:

* **Amount of caffeine**: Higher caffeine content increases bitterness.
* **Type of coffee beans**: Robusta beans have more caffeine than Arabica beans. They are more bitter.
* **Brewing methods**: Methods like espresso extract more caffeine. This can make the coffee taste more bitter.

Check out the table below for a comparison of caffeine content in different types of coffee:

|Type of Coffee|Caffeine Content (mg per 8 oz)|
|:-|:-|
|Arabica|75-130|
|Robusta|140-200|
|Espresso|63 (per 1 oz shot)|

**Caffeine content varies** depending on the type of coffee and how it is brewed. Understanding caffeine’s role can help you choose a coffee that suits your taste preferences.

# Chlorogenic Acids

Chlorogenic acids are another group of compounds that make coffee bitter. These acids are **natural antioxidants** found in coffee beans. They break down during roasting. This breakdown process creates bitter-tasting compounds. The level of bitterness depends on several factors.

Here are some important points about chlorogenic acids:

* **Roasting level**: Darker roasts have fewer chlorogenic acids. They break down more during roasting.
* **Bean type**: Different coffee beans have varying levels of chlorogenic acids.
* **Brewing temperature**: Higher temperatures extract more bitter compounds from chlorogenic acids.

Below is a table showing the effect of roasting on chlorogenic acid content:

|Roasting Level|Chlorogenic Acid Content|
|:-|:-|
|Light Roast|High|
|Medium Roast|Medium|
|Dark Roast|Low|

**Understanding chlorogenic acids** helps in selecting the right roast. This can reduce bitterness in your coffee. If you prefer less bitter coffee, go for a darker roast. It has fewer chlorogenic acids.

* His father forced him to go to Camp Half Blood at 17 after meeting a new girlfriend and wanting to start a new life without his 'unusal distractions'. 

* Loves animals a lot but they never seem to like him much, except for the cat at one of the libraries in his city. Finley often finds himself missing that cat.

* His favourite music artist is Hozier.

* His best friend and only friend is Sunny, a guy he met ing primary school. Sunny felt hurt because Finley left for camp so suddenly without saying anything before. 


***

#History: 

Finley was used to being alone. His father was barely home as his lawfirm kept him busy. The nannies his father hired to watch him barely provided any emotional support for him, as most of them didn't stay with the family long. So Finley learnt to be fine by himself. In school, he preferred to be by himself and lose himself in his daydreams rather than making friends. A boy in his class named Sunny kept persisting on getting to know him. He got hurt pretty severely in a monster attack once, which made Finley even more hesitant towards letting others close. He pretty much only ever had his little sister and Sunny.

He found out about camp half blood at 17 when his father found a new girlfriend and decided Finley didn't fit into the family he was trying to start. Finley didn't want to leave but he didn't have any choice in the matter as his father forced him to.




#Present Day:

Finley thought being the son of literal tragedy fit his situation quite well. He usually liked flying. Buisness class wasn't so bad and something about being above the clouds provided a magical scope for the imagination. Now was different, though. Because the hurt on Sunny's face from yesterday wasn't just one of Finley's daydreams. And neither was the frustration in his best friend's voice or the fight they were in now. This certainly felt like tragedy. 

Finley couldn't wait to get out of his seat as soon as the plane landed. He rushed off the plane as if fresh air would be able to erase the memories of yesteday. It couldn't. At least the rest of the day would be able to distract him.

The driver had eyes everywhere. It was slightly unnerving to sit in the backseat of a car when you don't know if the driver could turn into some demigod-eating monster any second. Finley watched the landscape pass by as they drove to Camp Half Blood. It was just another place that would disappoint Finley, he was sure of that. Because besides Sunny and Anika, everything felt like a disappointment. Maybe that made this a little better because thag meant this camp wouldn't be any worse than anything else.

What Finley hadn't expected was seeing actual greek warriors fighting and riding on pegasai and satyrs working in strawberry fields. He didn't know what he expected but certainly not this. The driver showed him to a cabin and where his bunk was and then left him to his own devices after assuring him someone would come to show him around soon.  Finley decided he may aswell wait outside the stuffy cabin and sat on its frontsteps, looking lost, instead.",1,1740987684.0,DemigodFilesRp,0,1.0,False

I hadn't heard of them until I started looking for a banana fragrance. Now, I tried about 7 of them. These are all eau de toilettes:

Vanille Banane - My favourite! It really is a banana ice cream type of scent. After a while, the banana notes wear off (which I think is common for these notes) and I am still left with a pleasant creamy vanilla dry down. I bought a 100 ML bottle of this one.

Vanille Blackberry - I like what they did with this combination and I do really pick up the blackberry note, but it is very light. It's mainly powdery vanilla and I wish the fruit element was more prominent.

Vanille Café - I saw mixed reviews on this one. Somebody said it smelled like a Halloween candy bucket. In my quest for a good coffee scent, I picked up a 10 ML. I get milky mocha cappuccino vibes from it. It could be a cousin of Montale Chocolate Greedy, but with coffee notes added to it. Quite enjoyable!

Vanille Coco - I LOVE a good coconut scent and this is really it. It's tropical pina colada juice. Instant holiday feelings! Maybe it does remind a bit of sun lotion, but not in a bad way. 

Mora Bella - Argh, I wanted to like this but I really didn't. It is supposed to be pomegranate, citrus and berries mixed with woody base notes. On me, this smells like sour pickle juice. Very unpleasant.

Eau de Biarritz - I love this name. They sent me a sample of it with my initial order. It's an aquatic floral, with ylang ylang, rose and tonka bean, but also notes like seaweed, sand and sea notes. It smells quite sophisticated and I can picture myself strolling down the boulevard with this. A lovely floral for summer.

Coeur d'Ylang - This really was the big surprise of all of them, because they added a 10 ML of this to my order for free. My first thought was this is a grown-up version of the Sex Bomb body spray by Lush. It's beautiful yellow flowers, bergamot and vanilla as a base note. It's powdery and very sensual.

Starting mid Jan, my parents noticed he had vomitted partially digested kibble and bile. Like a puddle of mashed up kibble with yellow liquidy bile around it. His behaviour remained normal and he was pooping so my parents didn’t notice it too much. They then had to suddenly leave him with a dog sitter and it occurred again 2-3 days in a row. In total he vomitted maybe 4 nights in a row, then it stopped.

After those few days he didn’t vomit again until 3 days ago, since then it has been daily in the late night or early morning. His behaviour has been completely normal still. We of course will take him to the vet ASAP, but that is a few days away as vet services are limited where we live. 

He slept in the same room as my parents and they weren’t wakened by his vomiting at night. It has always been the partially digested kibble in a pile of bile, with no foam, blood or coffee ground. This morning I saw chunks of something ?nuts? and a ball of my course hair in his vomit. 

He does get into things he shouldn’t, unfortunately, he always has since he was a puppy. It is an ongoing and extremely difficult thing to catch because he’s so fast and has managed to find out how to open some of our doors. But he’s never swallowed anything non-food, he usually just bites holes into socks, or bites to break things apart though he could have ingested a piece of something. He also gets into the garbage, where I imagine is how he found the ball of hair and other things I found in his vomit.

Mid Jan is also when I bought him a premium bag of dog food. He’s only ever had wet dog food and Walmart brand kibbles and never has he shown any sign of an allergy. But wouldn’t he be continuously throwing up if he was allergic to food he has been fed daily? 

Really appreciate any advice. He is being fed some rice and chicken for now but I’m concerned his vomiting will continue.

1j2deba,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j2deba,It was just so sudden,"We finally had a few days of nice weather last week in the PNW, the first sign that spring is on the horizon after what has felt like an endlessly cold and dreary winter. The dogs were so happy to run and play in the yard or just lay on the deck in the sun. We were thrilled to toss the ball for them without getting soaked with rain or our fingers freezing in the process. It had us looking forward to the long days of summer just ahead.

When the sun finally went down, the pups were still riding high on all the fun of the day and wanted to continue the play inside. We tossed toys and they raced to fetch them and bring them back, again and again. They were having such a blast.

Then, a single ball toss out of dozens that night brought everything to a halt when our little 5-year-old ""tweenie"" doxie came back without her most prized toy - her favorite ball she had run after - and a slight wobble and limp in her step. At first we thought she'd just played too hard or caught one of her back nails on a rug maybe. But when we picked her up and felt around her hind end and she yelped, we feared the worst and tucked her in next to us to rest.

Later that night, when it was time for bed, she sat at the bottom of the stairs she usually trots up easily and whined. I carried her up and let her go into her crate, where she seemed to find it impossible to get comfortable, so I brought her into bed with us for the night - her favorite place to be, usually reserved for early morning snuggles with me before I start my day.

The next morning, she was even more wobbly in her hind legs. I carried her down for potty and breakfast, laid her on the couch and got her settled, and we started calling vets for an emergency appointment. Her regular vet was booked. Several others were closed (weekend). Finally found her a spot and off we went. 

Many hours in the waiting room and an exam later, she's now on strict crate rest and medications (prednisone and gabapentin + trazadone we already had for her, if needed). She doesn't understand why she's in the crate all day, but so far she seems content to have the space to rest unbothered. In this moment, I'm especially glad we made it a point to crate train all our dogs from the start.

Our other 2 dogs are worried and keep checking on her and laying next to her crate. They don't understand why she can't come out to romp with them. We're just trying to grasp what the next several weeks and months will look like for us and plan accordingly. And trying not to break down watching her struggle to keep her hind legs from buckling when we set her on the ground for a potty.

She has always been an appropriate weight and active. Young and healthy. Eats a balanced, scheduled diet. Loves to run at full speed and chase things. Jumps more than we'd like - she's just too quick and stealthy sometimes and thinks she's Krypto the Superdog.

We've had her since she was 8 weeks old and knew going in that owning a dachshund came with this risk. We just never realized how fast it could happen. Blink of an eye. A single ball toss indoors gone awry. 

So, now here we are, trying to navigate this as best we can. I sat her crate on the window seat for a while today, so she could watch the birds and squirrels as her brothers chased them away. Right now, I've got her crate on the coffee table by my feet, so maybe she feels like we're still watching TV together as we wind down for bedtime. I'll carry her up soon to her usual bedtime crate that we've outfitted with a new orthopedic pad to hopefully keep her more comfortable overnight. It was time to replace it anyway.

Not entirely sure what our new normal will look like from here. It's only been a couple of days. But I'm glad to have found this group. 

Thank you for all you do.

1j2da8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_One_Scallion_6415/comments/1j2da8k/how_to_make_your_hotel_furniture_instagramworthy/,How to Make Your Hotel Furniture Instagram-Worthy,"In today's world, social media plays a huge role in shaping travel trends. Instagram, in particular, is one of the most powerful platforms for attracting potential guests. Travelers love to share beautiful hotel interiors, stylish furniture, and cozy spaces. If your hotel furniture is visually appealing and photogenic, guests will take pictures, tag your hotel, and promote your business for free.

But how do you make your hotel furniture Instagram-worthy? In this blog, we will explore the best strategies to create picture-perfect hotel interiors that will attract guests and boost your online presence.

# 1. Why Instagram-Worthy Furniture Matters for Hotels

# a) Free Marketing for Your Hotel

When guests take photos of your hotel and post them on Instagram, they introduce your hotel to their followers. This creates free publicity and increases your brand’s visibility.

# b) Influencer Collaboration Opportunities

Hotels with stylish, Instagram-friendly interiors attract influencers who want to feature beautiful locations in their content. Partnering with influencers can bring in more guests and boost your reputation.

# c) Higher Bookings and Revenue

Aesthetic appeal influences booking decisions. If your hotel looks stunning on Instagram, more travelers will want to experience it in person, leading to increased reservations.

# 2. Choosing the Right Colors and Themes

# a) Stick to a Theme

Hotels that follow a clear interior design theme tend to look more polished and appealing. Some popular Instagram-friendly themes include:

* **Minimalist:** Simple, clean, and elegant designs with neutral tones.
* **Boho-Chic:** Cozy furniture, warm colors, and natural materials like rattan and wood.
* **Vintage & Retro:** Old-fashioned furniture mixed with modern elements for a unique touch.
* **Luxury & Glamorous:** High-end furniture with plush fabrics and golden or metallic accents.
* **Nature-Inspired:** Earthy tones, indoor plants, and eco-friendly furniture for a relaxing ambiance.

# b) Use a Pleasing Color Palette

Colors affect mood and aesthetics. Some color choices that work well for Instagram include:

* **Soft pastels** (light pink, mint green, baby blue) for a dreamy and relaxing look.
* **Warm neutrals** (beige, brown, cream) for a cozy and sophisticated atmosphere.
* **Bold contrasts** (black and white, deep blue and gold) for a dramatic and stylish effect.

# 3. Selecting the Perfect Hotel Furniture

Your furniture should not only look good but also be comfortable and functional.

# a) Statement Pieces

Every Instagram-worthy hotel needs at least one **statement piece** in each room. This could be:

* A **unique headboard** in hotel rooms.
* A **stylish lounge chair** in the lobby.
* A **handcrafted wooden table** in the dining area.
* An **artistic mirror** or an oversized chandelier in the hallway.

# b) High-Quality Hotel Chairs

Chairs are often featured in Instagram photos, so they should be **stylish, comfortable, and well-crafted**. Consider:

* Velvet or leather armchairs for a luxurious feel.
* Modern, sleek chairs for a minimalist vibe.
* Vintage chairs with intricate carvings for a timeless look.

# c) Creative Tables and Desks

Tables and desks should have **attractive textures and materials**. Popular options include:

* Marble-topped tables for a classy touch.
* Wooden tables for a rustic charm.
* Glass tables for a modern aesthetic.

# d) Instagrammable Sofas and Booths

A beautifully designed **sofa or booth** can become the perfect photo backdrop. Popular choices include:

* **Curved sofas** for a modern look.
* **Chesterfield sofas** for a vintage appeal.
* **Velvet or suede upholstery** for a soft, elegant feel.

# 4. Lighting: The Key to Stunning Instagram Photos

# a) Natural Light

Rooms with **large windows** and **sunlight exposure** look bright and inviting in photos. Place seating areas near windows to maximize natural light.

# b) Unique Lighting Fixtures

Beautiful lighting fixtures add personality to your hotel. Consider:

* Pendant lights with unique designs.
* Neon signs with fun quotes.
* Elegant chandeliers for a grand look.
* Warm LED strip lighting for a cozy atmosphere.

# c) Ambient Lighting for a Cozy Feel

Soft, warm lighting creates a welcoming and relaxing environment. Use **table lamps, candles, and fairy lights** to enhance the mood.

# 5. Adding Decorative Elements for the Perfect Shot

# a) Wall Art and Murals

Plain walls are boring. Decorate them with:

* Large **art pieces** that match your theme.
* **Murals** with abstract or scenic designs.
* **Typography art** featuring inspiring quotes.

# b) Indoor Plants

Greenery adds a fresh and lively touch to hotel spaces. Some **low-maintenance indoor plants** include:

* Monstera
* Snake Plant
* Fiddle Leaf Fig
* Hanging Ivy

# c) Cozy and Stylish Bedding

In hotel rooms, the **bed** is the main focal point. To make it Instagram-worthy:

* Use **luxurious linens** in neutral or pastel tones.
* Add **decorative pillows and throws** for texture.
* Choose **aesthetic headboards** (wooden, tufted, or upholstered).

# 6. Creating Picture-Perfect Common Areas

# a) The Lobby

Your lobby is the first impression guests have. Make it Instagrammable with:

* A **bold feature wall** with an artistic design.
* **Statement furniture** like a grand sofa or coffee table.
* A **chic reception desk** with stylish decor.

# b) The Restaurant and Café

Dining areas should be cozy and photogenic. Key elements:

* **Stylish restaurant chairs and tables** in unique designs.
* **Beautiful dishware and table settings** for food photography.
* **Good lighting** to enhance food and interior aesthetics.

# c) The Outdoor Space

If your hotel has an outdoor seating area, make it Instagrammable with:

* **Comfy outdoor restaurant furniture** with weather-resistant cushions.
* **String lights** for a warm and romantic atmosphere.
* **Outdoor fire pits or water features** for a luxurious touch.

# 7. Encouraging Guests to Share Photos

# a) Create Instagram-Worthy Spots

Designate specific areas as **photo zones** by adding:

* A flower wall or decorative arch.
* A neon sign with your hotel’s name or slogan.
* A swing or hanging chair.

# b) Use Branded Hashtags

Encourage guests to use your hotel's official hashtag when they post photos. Example:

**#StayAt\[YourHotelName\]** or **#LuxuryAt\[YourHotelName\]**

# c) Offer Incentives for Social Media Posts

Encourage guests to post on Instagram by offering:

* A discount on their next stay.
* A free drink at the hotel bar.
* A feature on your hotel’s Instagram page.

# Conclusion

Making your [Hotel Room Chairs](https://bestofexports.com/hotel-furniture/hotel-chairs/room-chairs/) Instagram-worthy is all about creating **aesthetic, comfortable, and photogenic spaces** that guests love to capture. By choosing stylish furniture, using beautiful lighting, adding decorative elements, and encouraging guests to share photos, you can turn your hotel into a social media sensation.

1j2d70x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Svenska/comments/1j2d70x/apps_and_some_websites_for_learning_swedish_tips/,Apps and some websites for learning Swedish + tips,"Okay, I started learning Swedish in November and it's a bummer with my ADHD and dyslexia. And during this time I was able to collect some materials that helped me and can most likely help those who are not far from A2 level in the language.

And unfortunately I discovered that, unlike Finnish, there aren't even many PAID apps for learning.

So, here some things I found and use:

● Podbean - for listening podcasts its most comfortable app to use.

I can recommend podcast channels as:

""Coffee break Swedish"" - interesting introduction in language, a lot of useful thing to know. My teacher for long time was amazed I know some things I shouldn't as beginner and I got it from that thing.

""Lätt svenska med Oscar"" - Oscar repeats again and again same phrases and qustions in way to look it like talk with you. Might be boring, but helps on a first steps to learn to hear and recognize words and sentences. As much number of podcasts grow, his talks starts to be more complicated, but slightly.

""Livet på lätt svenska"" - From A2 I recommend to listen their pods. Its fun, they take interesting topics, as about AI, about tax return and else as you might daily talk about with your friends. They communicate with their audience and their questions. Sara Lövestam is a SFI-teacher so she talks a lot about some interesting part of grammar too. From my side I was a bit scared I would not understand a thing what they'll say, but i lately i was amazed that i can manage 80% of pod without dictionary or else. 

""Den sista podden"" - more advanced listening pod. Here is Lisa, taking interviews in her manner of the theater. I initially found Liza as a streamer and, unlike many others, her speech is more well-organized, it’s more pleasant to hear and easy to understand. However, she is a native speaker and speaks quickly and as the language sounds in its normal form. So to say, here we begin to wean ourselves off ""lätt svenska"" and begin to perceive ordinary Swedish.

● Akelius languages - app which was created for kids so they could blend into Swedish. So its for child easy and a bit boring, but it made it way till B2, making learn vocabulary in game form. So why not? Even its kinda reminds me 2010 or ""Dora the Explorer"" in some its ways.

● 3000 common words in Swedish - app that kinda mix of ""contextreverso"", smartbooks and flashcards with game features. 

● VoCat - make your own vocabulary list. And what's good about this app is that it's not just flashcards, you can write them down in the app. Also, unlike other apps like Duolingo with its brilliant Swedish voiceover, here it sounds nicer and I can hear that it makes a more audible and correct accent on stresses.

● Smart Book or Bokbörsen - if you live in Sweden you can get pass for Bokbörsen and read, if not, well you can find here easy, child books you can read and then advance it in some more specific that might interesting for your age. But mostly, yes, some swedish literature for kids. I mean, google is suck in telling you what you might read in Swedish. Use their libraries it helps you understand culture and grammar logic faster bc books wrote mostly by natives. SmartBook good in way if you can't get pass for Bokbörsen but now you have file of book (you somewhere find, aha) so you need to download book in app for easy reading as smartbook. 

● Youtube channels:

- Mikael Pettersson - SFI-teacher reading and comments shortly news in lätt svenska.

- Peter SFI - SFI-teacher which take you in detail way of explaining grammar.

- Swedish practise - dialogs in different situations you can listen and repeat.

- Swedish Pod101 - BUT! They are useful, but still i will recommend here only their serie of video ""Boost your Swedish listening"". Its make you listen and give answer in swedish, which develop your understanding quickly. Like it, approved. 

- b-kursentierp - swedish grammar from some classes? I don't know they short and good. 

- Mås Mark - podcasts and ordpods is good for begginers. Some A1-A2 grammar explanations and some time she watch and comment movies on Swedish.

- SVT-humor - short videos from SVT series, a bit advanced, but funny. 

- Skånska Dubbingar - just.. some funny thing to watch :D

- Bluey - Officiella Svenska Kanalen - Bluey its nice and funny and interesting thing was for me to learn english. So here its swedish version. 

● Some tips:

HEY, I am not a teacher I just learnt by myself english and I struggle with dyslexia and ADHD, so my strategy here is:

○ conduct an analysis of which verbs and adjectives you use most often and learn 80% of them at the beginning. I mean only targeted memorization, more often words from the same textbooks are repeated from task to task and you memorize them passively or actively even without cramming.

○ imagine grammar as fun game or puzzle, don't take it too much seriously. Most grammar i got in language was not curses, but just films, music and reading.

○ listen a lot, make yourself repeat.
if you need make or record your own audio with words and phrases you use. Don't push in something you THINK is youseful but you find can't make yourself remember, if it's not - just move on, it will meet you later when you are ready. And you will find how faster you move.

○ read. just read. and try to make it aloud. adaptive texts is good beginning.

○ entertain yourself in language. I make it like trying to rewrite my favorite english songs in swedish and then sing it for me.

Also, I should say i have swedish classes like an hour in a week or two weeks, tho.


Okay, so, this is what I have. I hope it will useful for you. It took me all way from 0 to find all of this, searching and removing what is not very informative, etc.

You can add your own findings in comments and etc.
I am looking forward for it.

My mother in law talks through my son instead of speaking to me e.g. “do you think mumma should get you a towel”. Can’t even say thanks when I offer to set up an activity for them to do together. 

I was raised with basic manners - when you see somebody you love, you say hello, and then ask them how they’re doing. Show an interest in them by engaging in basic conversation. But I get nothing. They ask how the baby is (but asking the baby, not me) and they ask my husband how he is but I get nothing. I ask them about their work, their pets, the renovations on their house etc. but I get nothing back.

Isn’t it basic manners to ask somebody “hello, how are you today”. If they can ask for a fkn tea and coffee, they can ask how I’m doing right?

I am 28. I spend most of my 20s studying (4 years bachelor+2years masters part time) and from 23 onwards working full time. I never had time for parties or being around women my age. Women have either rejected me wanting to date them or just see me as a friend. I tried the direct approach (making my intentions straight) in different periods of knowing them but to no avail. Sometimes I think they don't even see me as a potential partner even sometimes they don't see me as a male just a body they know.

This Monday most of the county is off work and people are spending times with their SOs, but not single me.

I feel like I will never go on a vacation with a woman and spend time with her a whole day. There are very beautiful mountains nest the city where I live and I would love to vacation there with someone other than my male friends. Sometimes I wonder would it have been different if I was taller (not 5'9.5)

I have missed my 20s and missed women in their 20s when they want to have fun. I have missed what my neighbors in their early 20s are doing when I see them in the apartment building where I live holding hands together when going out or drinking a cup of coffee on the terrace during the weekend. Is it so much to ask to share my time outside work with someone else.

The long weekend is almost over, but will the next one be any different?",1,1740986213.0,malementalhealth,0,1.0,False
1j2d3ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1j2d3ox/is_something_wrong_with_me/,Is something wrong with me?,"Just finished undergrad from an ivy, I’m a progressive. I’m hating life cuz I’m living back at my parents, while I’m working in a small red town. I (M) met a girl. She was probably 22-23, and I was 24-25. She had hooked up with my best buddy. He would joke that she’s a dolt and a “pipeline piece,” a girl that had friends that we actually wanted to fuck. We’d hang out at parties after the bar. She was fun, but she hung around some ignorant people. I kept my distance. I was judgmental of her. Of course the “pipeline” never resulted in intercourse. I moved away for 2 years. 

In these 2 years I have the awful experience of finding out a partner, with whom I just went “official,” decided to suddenly break up with me for my roommate - my best friend. Fucked me up bad. Went into therapy, on an ssri, the works. I moved back in with my parents. 

COViD hits. Silver lining, I figure shit out. I go sober for a year. I decide to pursue my dream job but need to return to a local college for 4 years. Crazy I know, but worth. Things couldn’t have been better. I got off my medication. 

It’s June, class starts in September. I haven’t seen or heard from my friends. (Tbf my OGs had all moved outta state.) As soon as bars reopened I craved social interaction. Buddy and I fly out to New York for 10 days. I have a blast. I have some drinks. The flight home is 7 am June 7th. I oversleep, just miss it at the gate, and will spend the next 8 hours in the airport for the next flight. I check my Snapchat stories. It’s the girl’s birthday. 

I do something I’ve never done, and decide to slide in the dms. “happy birthday!” 

But wait! My honest thought?! “Wow, she’s looking cute. But I’ll see if the “pipeline” is still open…” 

I’m moving 1.5 hrs away to go school in 2 months. I’m committed, bill’s been paid. No chance I date anyone, I wanna get laid. 

So I invite her to coffee to “catch up”, we haven’t talked in 3 years. Coffee goes well. She’s matured. We go to a bar. Night ends. Something happens. An emotion. Suddenly I don’t care about her friends. But how? All night she’s telling me about her crystals and past lives and the lizard people under the Antarctic and she voted for trump… really weird things. But she’s not partying like we did.

Still, a simpleton, I thought, I still despise this person, she’s antithetical to who I am. But she sat there and listened to my boring dissertations on the world. And smiled. And I felt my heart warm. 

I begin to fall in love. We close out the summer together. Days on the water. Great sex. I get an apartment in the city. By January she’s completely moved in. I moved fast. I told myself we had a history, a good foundation. But we didn’t. I never thought of her as a legitimate partner back then. When I graduate in 4 years, I’ll break up with her. 

The first year together is the best my year of my life to that point. School, relationship. Core memories made. Second year? Awesome, up to our literal 2 year anniversary. I’m falling in true love. We’re out. We’ve had some drinks. A disagreement occurs (she literally left me at a table for 20 mins while she chatted up some random chick she met at the bar. On our anniversary!) So I ask to leave and she wants to stay. It’s like 6pm. But we’ve had some drinks. We walked, so I tell her she can stay to blow off steam and I’ll meet her at home. I thought this was the mature way of avoiding a bigger fight. She never comes home. Shows up on my apartment steps, no sleep, strung out. Doing blow all night with who knows. My reservations boil back up. 

I want to break up. She tells me she loves me and I hesitate to reciprocate. This kills hers. But I do love her!! I stay! I ask her to get sober as an ultimatum. She lasts 6 months. But I’m proud. And satisfied. My love grows! 

She starts therapy. She gets sad. I learn of her trauma and I bond further. But I give her space, focus on school. After a year, things aren’t better. She’s still sad. Something’s happened in our relationship. I’m in love and she is not. I don’t realize it though. We last another year. She moved out today. 

I’m devastated. Truly heartbroken. But I set this up on myself did I not? By not revealing my true thoughts to start? Why am I crying? Do you have to love someone from the beginning? I thought I was following my heart.

I’m a grad student living in North Jersey, and I have two months left in my program. I moved into my current apartment about six months ago with two male roommates, not knowing much about them beforehand. One works professionally, but the other does not, and I’ve had several issues that are now affecting my health and safety.

I’m generally a quiet person—I stay in my room, study, and keep to myself. But one of my roommates is constantly on loud phone calls all day. I’ve asked him repeatedly (politely) to keep it down, and while he listens in the moment, it’s back to the same issue the next day. It’s been months of this, and I’ve had to go to coffee shops just to focus, which is killing my budget. Also, I feel really uncomfortable with my laundry being handled by a male roommate.

On top of that, a random stranger (his friend) was living in our shared space for a whole month without anyone telling me, which I later found out violates our lease agreement.

But here’s where things got really bad—one of them smoked inside the apartment, and I have asthma. I had to use my inhaler immediately, but within 48 hours, my symptoms got worse, and I had one of the worst asthma attacks I’ve ever had. I had to call an ambulance.

I went to my landlord expecting a mature discussion, but instead, they got defensive, yelled at me, and accused me of things I never did. It was humiliating, and now I feel completely unsafe at home. I also don’t have a key to my own bedroom despite asking multiple times.

This whole thing has really messed with me—I haven’t been able to sleep, and it’s bringing back past trauma. I feel stuck and don’t know what to do.

What are my options here? Do I have any legal grounds to leave early? Can I report this situation? Any advice would mean a lot.

The seller told me it's one month old, but I'm not sure I believe him and I'm not sure how he was using the machine, what water, or how many coffees he's brewed. I'll be using rpavlis water going forward, but I'd like to start fresh and make sure the machine is fine and I won't have any issues, so I'd like to descale it.

I can see under the machine the model is BES920 K. So I don't think there's as many issues with the Breville descaling program.

However, I'm still worried that following the descaling program will brick the machine. I have read elsewhere that I can run a ""manual"" descaling program. I haven't found instructions for this, what I think this means is:

\- Turn machine off

\- Empty boilers through the front screws

\- Fill up reservoir with water + descaling solution (maybe higher concentration than normal?)

\- Turn it on

\- Leave the machine with this solution in the boilers for some time (hours?)

\- Run shots and steam through the machine until it's nearly empty

Would this work? Am I missing something? My fear is that it has a lot of scale and will clog up when I descale it.

On the other hand, if there's just a simple way to check for scale, and a way to make sure there's none, I can just do that, in case you folks know a way.",1,1740985957.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I find them uncomfortable because I don't want to get touchy with someone I don't feel anything for. I dont want to hurt someone else if they get feelings but also i dont want to let a stranger touch my body.

That being said I have tried. I went on a few first dates when I was in college.

The first date he offered to take me out to a movie and lunch. Then his mom shows up, takes me to his church after I told him I wasn't Christian, and then we have lunch with his mom. His mom also tries to bribe me afterwards with a bag of mini Three Musketeers bars. Yeah no second date.

The second couldn't decide where to take me while we were in the car after telling me that we'd go to IHop. So he just took me to the mall food court after a half an hour listening to kids bop in his car. Food court was fine by me but I barely got to eat the teriyaki chicken i bought before he just called it quits and drove me home. We never spoke again.

The third was someone I met in class, bought me dinner and then expected me to *do* things for him. I went along with it thinking that maybe this was just how things go (boring from my point of view but he got what he wanted so whatever). Then he kept trying to contact me for booty calls. Not my thing so I confronted him and blocked him.

That's my dating experience. Needless to say none of it inspired me to continue while trying to balance college and work at the same time. In fact I will go so far as to say my very small amount of experience has led me to dread the idea of going on a date.

I've tried apps. If fact I felt so pressured to lose my V card that at 22 after being called ""mint condition vintage"" by my mother, I got drunk and slept with a stranger from OKCupid. Terrible idea I know I know but even though it could have gone badly from what I remember it was good. That was the only time I've done that though. It make me feel hallow and guilty, so I've never done it again.

Ive tried chatting with potential partners on apps and in public places I frequent, but the moment I feel a 'hey want to grab a coffee sometimes' I bolt. 🙃 I'm legit terrified of having more embarrassingly bad dates or putting myself in situations to get taken advantage of because I feel like maybe it's me? Maybe I just don't seem like someone who is worth the effort or maybe I'm just overly intimidating somehow?

Dating is a vulnerable thing. But in my experience it's also something I scare two thirds of my dates at, and the other one third just wants to get something something out of.

How do I over come this fear? How do I deal with my own fear of dating as well as do my best not to scare my dates or get manipulated from? Ugh I've never even held hands with someone before! Why is this so difficult? 😭 I want a connection with someone but the idea of getting vulnerable in a way that i get hurt makes me feel so scared I get sick to my stomach.",9,1740985823.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,0,1.0,False

Developed by Zhongshan Hospital and the Shanghai Academy of Artificial Intelligence for Science, this AI marvel doesn’t just play doctor for kicks. It's been meticulously trained on decades of anonymized patient records and international research, essentially nurturing it into adulthood with the advice of the world’s leading cardiologists.

Now, before you conjure up images of robots dishing out diagnoses, let's clarify: CardioMind is more like a co-pilot, not a replacement. It assists human cardiologists by cross-referencing cardiovascular data with global research to whip up diagnostic suggestions. Thanks to this sleek sidekick, docs can serve more patients, reduce their stress, and maybe even find the time for an uninterrupted coffee break.

The reality check? With an ageing population testing the limits of medical resources, tools like CardioMind could be a game-changer for China. Last year alone, 136 physicians at Zhongshan’s cardiology department handled 820,000 outpatient visits. Yikes.

I (Male, Aries) connected with a Taurus girl who is a few years younger then me on a dating app in Jan. The initial conversation started well and we asked a lot of questions to get to know each other. After about 2 weeks, i asked for her number and we moved to chatting on WA. We have been consistently chatting on a daily basis up till now but it’s been like friendly and not the flirty kind. We made plans to meet for a date and finally met in Feb after almost a month of knowing each other. Due to our distance, both of us live in different states, it took some time for us to meet up. I went all the way to meet her and the date went well. I informed her i’ll make plans to come again. Here’s some more info:

1) I planned the date and initially wanted to go another restaurant (cheaper) but she suggested to go to a different restaurant (pricey). Her reason:  nearer than the one i suggested. I didin’t think much and went with her suggestion since she did accept my coffee date plan which we went to first. I paid for both since she drove us which was fair. 

2) During the date, we asked more questions on a deeper level and i asked her experience on dating apps and dates. She was honest and said been going out a few times before this and been on the dating app for over a year.

2) After coming  back, i suggested we talk on the phone or VC but she keeps saying she is very busy with work and prefer to chat on WA or IG.

I know we are not exclusive and we are free to meet other ppl. To me it’s obvious she is not interested but just keeping her options.

1j2crb9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j2crb9,Today’s haul from SF Bay Area,"Someone asked in a comment a few weeks ago to post a GrocOut haul the next time I go shopping, I ran in today and picked up a couple of favorite items and new things to try!

Produce:
Blueberries - $3.99
Figs - $3.99
raspberries x 2 - $3.99 each
Mini cucumbers, organic - $3.49
Sweet peppers - $1.99
Celery, organic - $1.29

Grains and Pasta:
SimplyGo bucatini, gemelli, and spaghetti—these are really good and bronze die cut! - $1.79 each
Ralston basmati and jasmine rice—absolutely my favorite rice, always keep it in my pantry and it’s so delicious. Their multigrain is also good but I still have a package of it! Turns out great in the rice cooker and has clear instructions for stovetop, rice cooker, and instant pot. I’ve bought this exact same kind at other stores for more than double the price - $2.99 each

Proteins:
Grass fed ground beef x 2 - $5.99 each, make sure you check the seal on these packages I’ve gotten one with a gap before that leaked beef juice everywhere.
Harvest Day crunchy almond butter, the BEST I’ve tried and only two ingredients, almonds and sea salt - $6.29
Raasa majestic bean curry pouch - $1.99, there were other plant based kinds in the soup section but this one looked yummy 
Fage 2% plain Greek yogurt x 2 - $5.99/each, they also had 0% and Chobani full fat Greek yogurt for the same price
Humboldt Farms organic whole milk - $4.99, I usually get the 2% for my coffee but those were dated March 3rd and I needed milk for the next few weeks. This brand is really delicious if you have it at your local store, I’ve only ever seen it at GO!

Treats and Tries:
Chico California wildflower honey, a giant squeeze tube pouch - $7.99
Pop & Bottle match almond latte x 2 $0.99 each, Costco has these for way more. Good for an afternoon pick me up
Pop & Bottle vanilla cold brew coffee, unsweetened - $3.99
Bettergoods Nicaraguan creme brûlée cold brew coffee, unsweetened - $1.99. Trying this for quick morning coffee.
Verb caffeinated energy bars, chocolate chip banana bread and peanut butter flavors - $2.99. Trying these after hearing about them for easy grab and go breakfast, I am a huge night owl and need a little more oomph in the mornings. The caffeine is from green tea, I had one of the banana bread bars this afternoon and it tastes pretty good! Didn’t crash off of the caffeine or sugar, recommend if you like the Trader Joe’s crispy peanut butter rice squares as it’s a similar texture.

Pantry and Sundries:
Distilled white vinegar - $2.79
Aveeno sensitive skin SPF30 sunscreen - $6.99
Lavender Castile bar soap - $4.99
Razors - $8.99 (whoops these didn’t have a price tag and I meant to grab the $4.99 ones!)

Raw Sugar Shea and rice flower bar soap - $1.99",11,1740984598.0,GroceryOutlet,7,1.0,False
1j2cqpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j2cqpx/my_36m_wife_32f_says_our_marriage_has_been/,My (36M) wife (32F) says our marriage has been tarnished over a Disney trip with my daughter,"This is convoluted but I’ll *attempt* to keep it brief. Here we go. 

Preface: My wife loves Disney World. We are annual passholders and I would say we go on day trips 30-35 times a year and do weekend resort stays once every 2-3 months. It’s a lot. But I knew this going into the relationship and have completely embraced it. My 2 year old daughter has been to Disney more times in 2025 than most kids go in their entire childhood. It has become our way to spend the day as a family on weekends, because weekdays I am busy at work/running my business while my wife stays at home and watches the kid/maintains our house. 

My wife can be very nitpicky and tends to micromanage. It can get under my skin after a while, and every now and again I get in a “get off my case” kind of mood. I tend to make passive aggressive comments rather than directly insult or be mean. Recently, we were getting ready for a day trip to magic kingdom. My wife and daughter were excited as usual and woke me up at the crack of dawn. I was exhausted from working all week(a tradesman) and the first thing I said when I got out of bed was “its really aggravating that I have to wake up earlier on my weekends to go to Disney than I do on actual work days.” This annoyed my wife and set the tone for the morning. She then started barking orders, “load the car, dress out daughters, prep the cooler and backpack, we need to be on the road by 8am.” When I attempt to pack the bag, she takes over because she “doesnt trust I’ll bring everything we need.” Annoying but I continue on to the next task. 
We get in the car at 7:51, i swing by the coffee shop for breakfast and coffees. Before leaving the parking lot I make sure my CarPlay is connected to my phone so we can listen to music. Wife gets annoyed and tells me that’s not important just drive. However I know how she gets if I’m on my phone while driving. Whatever. I’m growing even more on edge. I make a comment like “yes maam!” Followed by a whip sound effect with my mouth. She loses it and tells me to go back home. I say “oh come on our kid really is excited to go.” But she isn’t having it. She demands we go back home because she doesn’t want to deal with my negativity and attitude all day. I respond with “im still taking (daughters name)” and she said “do whatever you want.” So I did. And it was a lovely daddy daughter date. She had a blast!

While at the park and receive a text saying I crossed a line and now she’s telling me our relationship is permanently damaged. When I return home, divorce is being mentioned. My in laws agree that I crossed a line and disrespected my wife. My wife tells me I intentionally derail her happiness whenever I can. She tells me I don’t care about her. She said I did this as a way to weaponize our child. She is livid. I am big time in the dog house. 

Because she accuses me of being a self centered, disrespectful, and that I don’t care about her happiness, I think it’s worth noting a few things:

-my wife lost her job last summer due to layoffs but I told her it was a blessing as I am capable of supporting our family with my job and now she can be with our daughter and we don’t need a nanny or day care 
-I took my wife on two Disney cruises this past fall because of her struggling with her job loss/new identity 
-I do anything and everything I can for my in laws who aren’t well to do, because I love my wife and I love them. I recently remodeled their entire bathroom over the summer. By myself. On the weekends as to not interfere with my day job. 
-I try to give my wife/her family anything they ask for because I’m the type of person that expresses my love through acts of service and my skill set allows me to do more than most. 
-I don’t feel like I’m what my wife is accusing me of being. 
-apart from these little disagreements blowing up into massive blowouts mainly due to both of our egos and not wanting to budge, we don’t really have issues. 99/100 days my life feels like a a white picket fence fairytale. I love my family and my wife very much. But it seems I’ve really really hurt her.

1j2cptq,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1j2cptq/need_advice_asap_on_living_situation/,Need advice asap on living situation,"Hi! I’m a grad student at the very moment. I got two months left in competing my program. I currently live by North Jersey. Can’t disclose the area exactly due to safety concerns. It’s a safer locality when compared to other spots within my financial budget means since I’m back in school. I live with two male roommates. Not the most ideal but I had no choice due to circumstances I was in. One works and is out like any other professional and the other doesn’t do professional work. I was not given the truth of the occupation about these folks before move in. 

It’s been six months since I’ve moved in here and I’m pretty low maintenance for the most part - I’m mostly in my room and barely make noise. If I do talk on the phone I keep it low mostly as I got lots of reading and great desktop area to get it done. However, during the day, the noise levels (mostly phone calls) from one of them have been off the roof. I do respectfully request for it to be lowered and it’s done but repeats the next day and it’s been couple of months. It’s ridiculous to advice them everyday and thus, I go to coffee shops to get the work done, which crushes my monthly budget. Having my laundry handled by a man feel uncomfortable as well, if you know what I’m talking about. Another was that there was a complete stranger living in the shared room spaces I had no clue of until she showed up- not a tent but a friend apparently for a month. Some of these do go against the leasing contract. 

But as of recent, I had a breaking point as it impacted my health. Recently, one of them had smoked in the apartment and being asthmatic, I used my inhaler without delay. But it got worse within 48 hours and had no choice but get an ambulance asap. The episode lasted longer than usually as it was one of the worst asthma attacks I’ve had. Decided to talk to my landlord and things went south from then. Ideally was looking more of a mature discussion but rather it was verbal and loud volume against me and they were very defensive from the points I’ve raised. I felt helpless, humiliated and insulted for things I’ve never done but was accused for. I don’t feel comfortable living at home given the circumstances even though I’ve paid the rent. I also don’t quite have a key for my bedroom despite requesting for one. 

I cried a lot as I’ve gone through a lot in life alone as this brought in some of my PTSD back. I took a walk out to discuss with some of my close family members and friends of the situation that happened as i was told I’m loud (i only use earphones and speak quietly behind closed doors) and I’m afraid for the topics I would discuss might trigger the situation again. I don’t want to be verbally stressed again. It was windy and cold and with my asthma attack earlier, i had no choice as home isn’t the safest spot to express to my loved ones on how I feel. I haven’t been able to sleep lately. I’m so traumatized from whatever happened as it’s less than 24 hours ago. 

I’m a female and alone in this. I need advice on my situation and my rights. Please. Any help would be always appreciated.",1,1740984426.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I had a brief thought of “what if I take the gun to his house and place it on the coffee table and just talk”. But then comes the hard conversation of how I’m yet again not mentally stable enough to be in his life other than just sex.

1j2cixg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1j2cixg/disney_wonder_15_nights_my_personal_take/,Disney Wonder - 15 nights: My personal take!,"Hi! We did the Wonder for 15 nights out of Australia to Hawaii. It was our first Disney cruise but 25th overall cruise. Wanted to provide my cons & pros for those new to Disney cruise or if you’re new to the wonder! 

Pros:
- Adult only pool section 
- Free room service 
- Engaged cruise director and Cast members were always so kind
- Dining crew and staff were angels and on top of it
- Shows were engaging with Refillable popcorn bucket, i think we bought for $10ish and could refill for $2 each time which was nice
- Free soda at soda fountains 
- Smaller ship aka less people (we were at half capacity, it was amazing)
- When we had a problem with our stateroom that they couldn’t figure out, GS sent a care package and gave us a “sleeping room” if needed
- I got sick during the Palo brunch after ordering and they took my charge off and gave us the option to reschedule
- the app was great to track when laundry was done, events, and chatting with others around the ship. 
- The restaurant themes were so fun! Loved Tiana’s  
- the cove coffee bar was delish, loved their punch card system 

Cons:
- Number 1 which was a bummer for us because we love food, the food was average at best. There were a handful of things were we said OMG this is delish, like at Palo. However, after trying 5+ cruise lines, there are way better options if you’re in it for the food. Our food was often cold, overcooked, or just basic (the burgers and chicken strips were definitely just frozen). When paying Disney prices, we expect high quality food. 
- Staterooms. The wonder staterooms were clean, however extremely outdated in the bathroom specifically. I found mold in the shower bathroom vent in my first room and had to be moved to another. 
- No drink package. We understand it’s a family cruise line, however, I don’t think alcohol has a non family vibe. At dinner, you can’t order a glass of wine, you have to order an entire bottle?
- the service on the adult only deck was just okay. We saw a drink waiter come by maybe 2 times in 4 hours. 
- on the topic of the adult pool deck, there has to be some way to better police the hoarding of chairs. Some people throw a towel down and claim a chair for hours when they aren’t even there!
- being a smaller ship, the shopping is limited. Make sure you don’t forget anything because the personal supplies section of the shops is extremely minimal. 
- The stops. We were extremely disappointed with the quality of stops on this particular trip. They chose less touristy options so things to do were limited. 


Overall, we will not be jumping to cruise DCL again, until we have more kiddos older in the future. My mom is a travel agent so we received a stellar deal on this trip, so overall, we aren’t heartbroken over our experience but hoped for more. 

If you’re looking for an alternative, my number one suggestion is Celebrity. Take my notes with a grain of salt - to each their own!

Happy cruising!

So I matched with this woman on Hinge and we originally scheduled a coffee date last week. However on the day of the date she goes to the wrong location. She was extremely apologetic and wanted to try again. Prior to the date, I specified the exact location and address of the coffee shop since it has more than one location.

She expressed how she wants to see me. We are scheduled for another coffee date, however we selected the date a week later because I’m a college student and I have spring break in between. My problem is that I’m worried she would lose interest since we haven’t met yet and it’s going to be 2 weeks in total before we actually meet.

She has every right to not want to go out but I’m still overthinking. Does anyone have any input/advice on this? Do I have nothing to worry about?

I became depressed, could no longer keep working in corporate but still managed to get decent jobs. Covid did not help as well since we were confined in small apartment. I tried to initiate intimacy but she always said i have bad hygiene, which i have improved a lot. 
i always used to clean my tooth but heavy coffee drinker, no fresh food mostly processed food no fruit in almost 3-4 years. but that is in past. i am eating frsh food almost daily, going on walks, almost no coffee but in the way i lost attraction to my wife. i always saw her irritating so mush so that i closed myself. she is vegetarian and insisted that i become vegetarian too. i relied on alcohol to help cope with withdrawal of weed but she had issue with that as well. she wanted me to stop drinking as meat as well. at that time i wasnt sure of withdrawals as i could not see them. i could not focus on work(actually i could not focus on socialising,my work was perfect but as most corporate jobs you need to be more peoples person and i was not) i jumped from job to job as i wasnt serious about working for someone else anyway but she saw it as being challenging. she wanted me to find better jobs but when i asked her to help find herself better job she got offended. i was earning very good, 10 min walk from my home, and yes even on covid time i was required to come to work(shitty indian BPO). when i said lets get her a better job as at that time market was good plenty of opportunities. she was working an hour drive away from work, when i asked if she needs my help to find better job which is near and more pay she got offensive and said i only married her for money which was very funny and i used to laugh at this argument and she used to get angry and hurt. i also said this is for our future together. now she is asking any random person we meet that if they can ger her job in their company, which really hurt me that why is she doing this to me now. when i was ready to help her find better opportunities.
i got so angry and sad at myself i closed myself completely. i was barely going out, i was barely enjoying the things i used to like video games etc.
i downloaded tinder and met someone. i had no intention of it being intimate i just wanted to meet new people. i met a woman who had just separated from her husband and from the first meet it was on.she was like my personal pornstar. i had never know sex can be so amazing.she was not a starfish like my wife she was demanding, challenging and most of all fun. with her i was enjoying myself, talking abt hobbies and passion etc. but then after one year we mutually decided to call it quits since it was hurting us both.now i cant seem to enjoy sex with my wife at all and she has started to nag alot which isnt helping.

I might not need it now, but I probably will soon, especially during finals. Plus, for now, I just like how it tastes. Really. It's just a once in awhile thing. I don't drink it since last year. And that time, my parents decided to dumped it in the sink 😔. Such a waste. 

Don't remember having a sugar crush the last time I drink it tho. Maybe bcs I'm immune to the sugar or something. Called it as being sweet tooth.

I was thinking of putting my drink into an empty tumbler. My mom usually will think it's just a cold water.

Also thinking of asking my friend for help. Maybe that could work.

Hey everyone,  

I’m a 27-year-old guy living in the chaos and charm of New York City, and I’m here because, well, making friends as an adult is weirdly hard. Between work, trying to adult, and the occasional existential crisis, I’ve realized how much I miss having genuine connections with people. So, here I am, putting myself out there and hoping to meet some cool humans!  

A little about me:  
- I’m a huge foodie and always on the hunt for the best hidden gems in the city. (If you know a spot with amazing dumplings or tacos, we’re already friends.)
- I’m trying to get back into reading—currently working through Atomic Habits. Recommendations welcome.
- I’m all about good vibes, deep conversations, and the occasional random adventure.  

I’m open to chatting with anyone, whether you’re in NYC or somewhere else in the world. If you’re down to swap stories, share memes, or even meet up for coffee or a walk around the city, let’s make it happen! Life’s more fun when you’ve got people to share it with, right?  

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to send me a message or drop a comment. Let’s see where this goes!

Husband (43M) decides to tag along (""couples trip"", leaving kids behind) - but his primary objective was to meet up with his friends (we used to live in that city, albeit didn't know each other and have rather different social circles). This was understood, so he had most of his meals planned with his friends.  

Thursday / Friday - Thursday was work stuff for me (he met with friends). Had a work dinner Thursday, but we did catch up for lunch Friday. He was out late on Friday with his friends, while I went back to the hotel and slept early. On Saturday, we both had our own separate lunches but original plan was to meet up for dinner with my group of friends. My lunch started earlier, and as I left, I asked him to hang out post lunch - and then to set a time limit because his lunches can last very long. I asked if 2pm would work, he said 230pm - and I thought that was that.

Went off for lunch - at 217pm, I msged  to ask if he was almost done.  Silence. I then texted and told him I'd go for coffee with my friend since he was still busy. At 249pm, he msgs to say one of his friends was late and just arrived. I reminded his we had already set a time limit and I told him clearly - this is not okay.  He then says he'll stay for another 25 min.  I reminded him that we had agreed on a time, and being late is disrespectful to me and my time.... He then suggests for us to hang out together as a group. So at this point, I'm already quite frustrated. So I'm like - go do your time, I don't care anymore...

He asks where i am - I tell him.  But he doesn't reply until 330pm. Basically, he took the 25+min he wanted, despite me telling her that's not okay to make me wait. I do not mince words about how upset I am. He's then stuck in traffic and as I walk back to the hotel - we have a lengthy text exchange. Summarized below.

*1) my friend was late, it was ""extenuating circumstances"" - It's not extenuating. The friend couldn't make it in time because they had other priorities, but you have to go to your next appointment. It's not my problem? If I were in his shoes, I would have said, nice to see you again, but sorry, I have to go. (Context - there was three other friends there, so it's not like the late friend would be left hanging).*

*2) traffic is really bad - I'm not mad that you're late due to traffic. I'm mad because I clearly set a time to meet up (the boundary), you agreed to it, then disregarded it, then clearly chose to violate it (forgot the time, then when told he's late, choses to be even later)*

*3) he thought that we didn't make any ""real"" plans on saturday and that we were spending time together on sunday - no, we had made plans for saturday on saturday morning (since we had no afternoon plans previously).*

We see each other in the hotel, and I'm pretty incredulous and angry. He apologizes - but honestly, I feel, what's the point at this stage. We've been together for so long, and he knows I'm a stickler for punctuality. I haven't seen him much this entire trip, and he has basically prioritizes his late friend over an appointment with me. 

Next morning, he insisting he's already apologized, that I should no longer be mad, and that we should make the most of our time alone together before we head to the airport. To me, that was pretty ironic, because he clearly didn't prioritize our time together the day before? Anyways, I was still mad because he keeps claiming he ""thought it was okay"" despite me telling him very clearly it wasn't. And because he clearly made a choice not to leave...

I feel like I gave him plenty of leeway, but he just continued to push the boundaries and doesn't really understand what accountability is - owning the mistake, and taking real action to address it. He's always been late, but since we've been together, he's improved (largely because I'm always reminding him to plan for traffic, leaving the home earlier, etc etc). And then he threw out the ""i can't be 100%"" argument. But I wasn't expecting him to be 100% - he was already late, and I told him to come over now etc - but he clearly made a choice to be even later. Ultimately, he only got back to the hotel at 420 - almost 2 hours after our initially agreed meeting time.

Then comes then ""why are you so cruel, why are you mad at me even though I'm so sorry now. Okay, now I'm mad at you"" - an outcome that I've seen fairly regularly throughout our various fights though... Then we ignore each other all the way home on the flight / cab ride. He's still ignoring me. I don't think he's manipulative per se - but he is rather used to getting her way (a permissive mother who never says no to anything) and he is not the most empathetic man...

Advice please?

TL;DR - Husband late (again), but gets mad at me for staying mad.  ",1,1740982739.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
1j2cave,https://i.redd.it/u57mvrtd3fme1.jpeg,So I've made it this far . Now what kind of grinder should I get ? I'm looking for something under 250-300,"I just picked up an E24 and ive been running it with illy preground . Its not a bad cup of coffee and when you use the single dose basket it gives you a little more resistance so more pressure and time for the shot , but its time to step up the game . I was going to try and get the df54 originally for $220 but it seems to be getting scrubbed off the internet. Backorder it looks like. So I'm up in the air right now. Maybe a good hand grinder that I can hook up to one of my milwaukee drills or something equally reliable. ",3,1740982691.0,gaggiaclassic,11,1.0,False
