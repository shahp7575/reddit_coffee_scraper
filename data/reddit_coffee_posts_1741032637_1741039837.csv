i dont even know where to start anymore. im 21f and my mom is 58. of course when i was small i couldnt realise her symptoms because i was a kid and then an annoying teenager, but my mom got to retire for a very good sum of monthly money, which she took as she would be getting a lot more money than when she was ever working. but this caused her to just close off socially, she was a stay at home mom and just got cut off out of society, she didnt have places to meet people anymore so she just stayed inside. she has 2 friends who also just refuse to go out to a simple coffee, and they just talk over the phone. whatever i offer to sign her up for (like book clubs or sports/exerciss/dance/walking) she refuses as she thinks its dumb and she doesnt have anyone to go with.

lately she has developed severe depression and debilitating anxiety attacks, and my dad had to take her to the emergency room and she got pilled up and is now taking doses of anti depression pills and anxiety medication and she doesnt get the panic attacks anymore, but she still doesnt want to go anywhere and isnt mentally well. i dont live at home anymore and i worry so much, i worry shes going to do something to herself if she cant handle it anymore, but her prison is so comfortable that she doesnt want to get better. or she does but doesnt 

its killing me to be 5 hours away and just worry the whole time did she leave the house that day while i need to study and work. its been so long that shes gotten so adjusted to not have anything in life to live for but collect money for me and my brother when shes gone, she doesnt want to understand that we dont care about some stupid money once shes gone but we just want experiences and memories with ther while shes here.",1,1741039742.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1j2uwn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1j2uwn3/overwhelmed_by_fiances_clutter/,Overwhelmed by fiance’s clutter,"I’m currently 7 months pregnant and nesting mode has kicked in hard. The current issue I’m facing is it feels absolutely impossible to make a dent in the house because my partner is a borderline hoarder. 

We live in quite a small two-bedder, so space is limited. In its current state, there isn’t an empty surface in the place, our living room has a load of his gym equipment in it and also functions as his workspace so the walls are covered in notes (in fact every wall is covered in some kind of note/postcard/random bit of art), the walls badly need a paint, it’s impossible to clean surfaces/floors because of the sheer amount of stuff. I’m a fairly tidy person who enjoys uncluttered, calm spaces, and I’m becoming increasingly more stressed by the fact that once our child arrives, we’ll have even more stuff and less room. 

Yesterday I got so emotionally overwhelmed I  snapped and had a meltdown at him about the mess. I unpacked all of my books out of a suitcase and put them on the only free surface in the house, the coffee table, to make the point I haven’t even been able to unpack my belongings since we moved in because the bookshelf is full of only his books. 

I then drew up a list of things I wanted to tackle together in a specific room, and his answer was to largely ignore me all day and go off and angrily clear out a space outside of the house. Not what I asked. It’s like he sees it as me trying to make him part with his things when actually all I want to do is return the communal areas into neutral spaces and be able to have guests over without feeling embarrassment. Please, any advice on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated.",1,1741039654.0,declutter,0,1.0,False

Not rings - screams. A shrill, desperate wail that echoes through the house.

She knows what’s coming. Knows what she has to do.

Her hands are drenched in blood - not hers. Someone else’s. The shovel feels impossibly heavy as she drops it onto the disturbed earth. The grave is shallow, but it doesn’t need to be deep...

The woman on the other end of the call whispers, ""It’s done. Thank you, love.""

Tears spill down her face. She did this. She had to.



\-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.



The phone rings.

She doesn’t want to answer. But she does.

""You owe me.""

Her mother, alive and well, hums softly in the kitchen, completely unaware of the horror unfolding on the phone.

""What… what do you mean?"" she stammers, gripping the receiver so tightly her fingers ache.

""You think gifts come without a price?"" The voice drips with something dark. ""You wanted her back. I did it. Now it’s time to repay me.""

A horrible sound plays in the background. The wet, meaty sound of something being cut.

""You’re going to bury what I tell you to bury,"" the woman continues. ""Make it disappear. Like it never happened.""

Her stomach lurches.



\-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.



She wakes up to the smell of coffee. She doesn’t drink coffee....

She stumbles into the kitchen, eyes still blurry from sleep. And there, standing by the window, sunlight pooling around her like a dream -

Her mother.

Breathing. Smiling. Alive.

She drops the phone from her hand. The old Motorola V3. The one she found in a box in the attic yesterday. The one that shouldn’t even work...

But it did.

And she answered it...

And the woman on the other end promised her something impossible.

""Change is easy,"" the voice had said. ""Tell me what you lost, and I’ll fix it.""

She had whispered her mother’s name.

And now she was here. Alive.

A miracle.

A miracle with a debt attached.



\-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.



The house was too quiet.

She had moved in just a week ago. It smelled old, forgotten. Like something had been left behind.

And then she found the phone.

Tucked away in the attic, inside a dusty wooden box. When she flipped it open, the screen lit up.

An unknown number. A call coming through.

She answered.

""Hello?""

A pause. Then, a woman's voice. Soft. Familiar.

""... I lived in that house before you,"" the woman whispered.

Something in her voice made her shiver.

""I can prove I’m from the past..."" she continued.

""How?""

""Tell me something you wish you could change.""



\-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.



She scrolled through the news, her stomach twisting.

The face on the screen was familiar - the previous owner of her house. A convicted murderer.

Her crimes? Unthinkable. Bodies buried in shallow graves, their remains found after years of decay. Victims who were never given peace.

Her last recorded words before execution?

""Someone will finish what I started.""

And now, standing in the backyard, hands stained red, she realizes...

1j2uva8,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1j2uva8/straight_bf_jealous_or_insecure/,Straight bf jealous or insecure?,"So I (27F) am bisexual and have been dating my straight boyfriend (30M) for about 3 years. He’s known I was bi since the very beginning. Over time he’s always made random comments that bother me about how he doesn’t know what I’m getting up to when I have sleepovers with my female friends, things of that nature. He just always passive aggressively makes comments that subtly imply I’m cheating on him with my female friends (ironically he only makes these comments about female friends of mine that he would consider attractive). No matter how I address these comments and explain they bother me, they still continue to happen.

Over the past year or so, I’ve gotten closer with a friend of mine (who I have known about 7-8 years) and she and I hang out pretty often. I don’t have a chance to see my friends as much anymore (due to most of them getting married, having kids, etc.) but this one friend has the same availability as me so we’ve just gotten closer. She is strictly my friend there is absolutely no romantic or sexual attraction between us at all. Neither of us feel that way about each other at all.

However, my boyfriend has become increasingly jealous(?) of my friendship with her. Often making the same snarky comments about when I just go get coffee with her, how often I see her, whether she’s “really straight,” and most recently, he’s mad that I posted a picture on my Instagram story with her when she and I went to a museum, but I never post any pictures with him. (I do want to note I posted it mostly because we went to a museum- something fun, out of the ordinary for me, and picture worthy. My bf rarely, if ever, does things like that with me.) I understood he wanted to take more pictures together but he still was unsatisfied with my answer.

He also makes snarky jokes/comments regularly about how easy it would be for me to cheat… or whenever I let him know of my plans to see my friend he just sighs and says something along the lines of, “well if you’re gonna cheat, you’re gonna cheat…” mind you he actually DID cheat on me. And has only been making these types of jokes and comments even more since I decided to forgive and move forward with him. 

It seems like it’s been a build up of this insecurity and/or jealousy for him, and I’m not sure if I’m just overreacting and just need to be more understanding towards his perspective. Just confused and frustrated but don’t want to be insensitive or selfish if that is what I’m doing.",1,1741039559.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False

1j2urnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/1j2urnc/something_about_submechanophobia/,Something about “Submechanophobia”,"The story follows Caden, who has a grandmother sent to a nursing home due to an accident after showing an episode of early-onset Alzheimer. What's interesting here is the implication of this for a woman that has been around for at least the '70s.

“The old wooden floors creaked under his feet. Grams's place was a two-bedroom home, wallpapered with tiny pink flowers. Her furniture dated back to the seventies; the matching brown-and-orange couch and recliner sported knitted doilies. There were piles of newspapers and magazines on the floor and on the coffee table. Baskets of yarn and unfinished knitting projects were placed around the living room. Her kitchen counters were avocado green, which clashed with the yellow linoleum. Even the dishes in the cupboards were old.”

So, Caden is 19, but it has been exactly a year since ’Grams’ has been out of home. But there's something else to note, this being that Caden wss actually taking care of Grams for years; while still assisting to school. He also mentions that he was been living with Grams since his 6, and he constantly mentions how he was being teased by kids. And he even mentions how the Alzheimer slowly made her Grams forgetting stuff like crafting, implying that the “early-onset” was advanced enough. In present time, she tends to forget about Caden's workplace every few minutes, because she's lacking of a short-term memory.

All of this to reach the conclusion that, unless Grams is a rare case, she's around her mid 60s, and started developing Alzheimer on her '50s (again, the usual).

So, what does this mean for a chronological placement for the story? She's at the very least younger than 70, but she has been living on her house since the '70s or even before that, but the truth is that it has remained unchanged since then.

If she was younger than 10, the story would be set between the late 2020s to the mid or late 2030s. If she was younger than 20, the stroy would be set between the late '2010s to the mid or late 2020s.

This second option seems to match quite well with “The Storyteller”, since it's implied that a Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex has opened recently at the beginning of the story, while “The Storyteller” takes a place, at the very least, a year after the opening. And the story, following “The Mimic” logic, was set in 2018.

But, the first option also matches with the usual idea of setting Security Breach in the mid 2030s, even in the 2040s.The truth is that things would be easier if there was some hint to how older was Grams during the '70s. But since there isn't, I guess there's not much else to do.",1,1741039297.0,fivenightsatfreddys,0,1.0,False
1j2urc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpain/comments/1j2urc9/my_success_story_4_years_later/,My Success Story 4+ Years Later,"Hey All, 

Some people were commenting on previous comments I made from years ago, asking what worked for me.  I know first hand how bad the pain is, how negative the outlook feels, & how debilitating hernaited discs can be. 

There is a few post in my profile with my story so I won't re-tell it all.  The long story short though is that I started suffering from two herniated discs in October of 2020.  (I ""threw my back out"" years before playing pickup baseketball but there was no nerve pain and the back issues went away after a few days).  I went through months of hell & doctors from a leading hospital/university told me that I would never recover without surgery and that I was risking permanent damage....they were wrong.  

A good friend of mine is a leading physical therapist.  He oversees 45+ clinics and personally treats many UFC & NFL players. He was the only one that was right on treating my injury.  He has seen MRI's that have looked like mine did, only to be cleared up weeks a part.  He gave me a lot of research-based tips, exercises and general information that was very impactful in my recovery.  Below are things that I attribute my revocery too, some information from my friend, other things I implemented, research & found on my own (if you're in the midst of it right now, I know you are also looking everywhere for possible answers):

1) SLEEP. 

This is the single most important factor. Sleep.  My PT friend would tell his early morning patients to skip the therapy session to sleep if they did not get enough.  Research shows this is the most important factor in injury prevention & recovery.  It is our super power. 

I changed my entire lifestyle around this.  Previously, I would go to the gym after work, take pre-workout and stay up late at night.  I was not only getting too little sleep, but the quality wasn't good.  I found Dr. Rangen Chatterjee on social media and listened to a few of his podcasts on sleep he did with leading experts.  

I started going to the gym in the morning, no more pre-workout at night keeping me up.  No more coffee after 12pm (listen to the podcast.  Afternoon coffee is like drinking a 1/4 cup right before bed!) Made other changes to improve sleep quality

2) Walking - Motion is lotion.  I'd walk in the mornings, take breaks from work and move, walk after work. 

3) Exercises.  I didn't read the back mechanic but I did implement some exercises I learned from PT.  Pressups, nerve flossing that type of stuff. 

4) Physcial Therapy - Nneeds to be a high quality place.  My friends rule...if they do not have dumbbells over 50lbs...do not go there. The place I went to had me doing MEANINGFUL strength exercises.  I'm talking about them strapping me in and doing back extensions.  This fucking hurt but I found it helpful.

Muscle imbalances put strain on your lower back.  Prior to this injury I had been neglecting glute exercises while have a strong upper back & hamstrings.  It put so much strain on my lower back.  

They gave me a ton of core exercises and not just planks and BS.  I'm talking about band work, resistence training...etc. 

Also, they had a traction machine....not sure if that helped but I enjoyed it.  

5) EDOLA exercises.  

These are centered around opening up and creating space between your discs. 

6) CONSISTENCY....I did these things religously. Everyday. just like everything else in life, you need to be consistent to see improvement. 

SUCCESS: Studies show that around the 8 or 9 month mark that a lot of herniatied discs spontaneously regress. The worse the herniation, the higher likelyhood that it would regress & heal on its own.  It happened to me.  Cried an entire 6 hour flight home, expecting to be in a world of pain the next day....instead I woke up and cried tears of joy.  I could bend over without pain. 

From there I continued with this regement.  My confidence improved in my back & physical activity slowly.   I do not deadlift anymore.  I do single leg squats but I am not putting more than 110lbs on my back...I do not compete nor am I a pro athlete.  There are other exercises to build muscle that are not only more effective but have a significantly less strain on my spine. 

You probably will never be 100% again...i'd say I'm 90+% though & am much better condition physcially.  I jump role everyday.  I can run, jump, sprint, dive, have sex...all that shit I used to be able to do that I couldn't.  Sure my foot may fall asleep if I sit on the toilet too long.  Every once and a while I have a little tightness in my piriformis, leg or back spasms.  But I know what the cause is now & I have the exercises and tools to keep it from being an issue. 

Hope this helps.

This is what changed: 3 months ago I went on daily 10mg rosuvastatin, cut alcohol back to 1 drink/week max, watched my refined carb & satfat intake like a hawk (more on that below), dropped about 20lbs (5'8"" middle aged male, 192lbs to 173lbs).

I've always eaten pretty healthy. Apparently we're an ""ingredient household"" according to the youth. Not a soda drinker or big snacker, don't eat much beef or pork, don't eat out a lot, and eat vegetarian about half or more meals. The biggest change was the alcohol consumption: went from 2-3 per day to a strict 1 per week or less. I also cut out almost all cheese and meat sticks (salami, prosciutto, etc), basically no more girl dinners. Smaller changes included switching to brown rice (at first) and then barley (wayyyy better than brown rice IMHO), replacing 1T/day sour cream with fat free Greek yogurt, switching to Instant Pot sweet potatoes instead of roasted white/yellow potatoes. And striving to eat until I felt 80% full instead of filling up completely. Even smaller changes were to incorporate 1 square of dark chocolate per day and a couple tablespoons of peanut butter per day most days, and enjoy 1 dirty chai per week from the local coffee shop.",1,1741039015.0,Cholesterol,0,1.0,False

mediocre. CPT (colored people's time) a black man’s thing, and I’m doing everything black this
month.
I’m being late to stuff. I’m getting sassy with Barista’s and Grocery store workers... I’m
focusing on my Bowel Movements.
Which brings me to one of this show [ Neal Brennan’s Blocks] Sponsor’s: Tushy!
So I was given access to an early Tushy Prototype some time ago. Take a Tushy bidet and then
a squatty potty, add it to your mourning routine. Mexican food will no longer be a problem for
you, ever again – Best times in my life were their first morning mission, with or without coffee, I
was able to complete it.
Buy a Tushy!
Question: Why is this month so short? Why doesn’t black history have a longer month!?
I think it’s because this is the month where my boss will request I put on an extra presentation
on the impactfulness of black people on commerce in America, as the only black person in an
office setting.
A heartfelt and beautiful presentation which I won’t be getting paid for, and no one will
remember…
Sounds suspiciously like a throwback to slave labor, Mmm-mmm, cut that shit off quicker.
Be mediocre all the time Black people but especially mostly during Black History Month.
I want to explain This Black HISTORY MONTH (In March), why it’s important, that there are still
circles that vehemently believe and defend Bill Cosby’s innocence.
I’m sorry what!?
Preface, I am not writing as a defendant of Cosby, nor to blame and victimize anyone involved in
this case, alleged or otherwise. I recognize the acquittal per his release as a fact of the case,
just as much as I accept every person’s right to defend their right to retribution with high morale.
I just kicked syphilis, cut me some slack.
I like to consider anyone with a theory of Bill Cosby’s innocence in possession of a

[WNT- weird ass theory.]
WNTS are an important contribution to our lexicon within’ black community, and let me tell you,
just because Black folk “invented them,” Or more likely discovered them. WNTS equitably the
the blacks have the right to express them over the oppressor at all times.
WNTs are what won the Trump presidential election, both times. WNTS are what Neal says
“Your uncle has said stranger things on the porch.”
My WNT, about Bill Cosby, started developing when I was nearly six years ago.
My dad passed away due to complications from “crack addiction.” The 90’s were a weird time. If
I could get anymore stereotypically black. Was this written by AI? No–bitch, that’s my real
fucking- life. My family owns a dresser of cassette tapes with beautiful films pirated from cable
television. And I still haven’t had to do pornography. What a miracle I am.
My dad left me one w/ 3 recorded assets.. Honest to God gems: “Who Framed Roger Rabbit,
“Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the making of Featurette” which is the best love story known to
mankind. Finally, and one episode of the Cosby Show, not even the whole episode, just this one
scene. [Cosby Show. The Cosby Show: ""Night time is the right time"" ] Not even, Just one. In
my attempts to come to know the personality of the man I only know as my birth father, I
watched this tape on repeat some days. Just hoping to feel his presence near me. Bill Cosby,
whether he wanted to be or not be, is an as important part of how I remember my father.
What is it to be a cultural phenom? That represents loads of people in an affinity group. An
affinity group that historically has been well, you know; what being black is – at this point, right!?
It’s hard to fathom to fathom, if you’re not black.

BETTERHELP :
Since My dad, I’ve been in Therapy on and off for 30 years.
I have used BetterHelp. My Boyfriend, sent me a subscription when we first started dating,
because I guess flowers were weird… BetterHelp was able to set me up with a therapist who
specialized in a type of grief counseling that I hadn’t used in the past. BetterHelp also has group
therapy if you need something with more people. You can connect via phone, video, even
message or text your therapist when you need to. I liked leveraging my answered journal
prompts when I was in therapy to help me keep track of my WNTS vs my needs.

My name Arlechino, If my favorite comedian in the world, crossed loads of cultural thresholds, in what I
believed was the “right way,” IE becoming the best black comedian in the show business ever,
the GOAT (if you will) and it turns out that he just got found out as doing some of the most
horrible acts imaginable on the planet, he’s not the bad guy. Those women aren’t even victims,
or anything at all, because I don’t know who Janice Dickickson is, and if my uncle knows, He
would rather be talking about Mary J Blidge.

Bill Cosby never becomes a villain to me...
In conversations about comedy, or otherwise, and I’m the bad guy, because arguably Bill Cosby was never
bad at comedy. Right!? Right!?!

No one disagrees with me… And no has disagreed with yet.

I’m the villain, because he made me laugh so hard, when I was a little boy, my daddy’s first son,
and made me feel so good about myself, and now I’m the “bad boy,” Because I let him fool me
into believing he was the best guy, and those women embarrassed and shamed me, because
that woman let that fooling happen.

 I am the self-aware Arlechino. And I don’t read the news-- 
As because my affairs are no longer current.
 It was the 90s and it was a weird time.

In comedy as a member of the black audience, you are always the top Arlechino.
No Schemingin the synagogue. My perception is that the joke I’m hearing live in Person– was written just for
me. 

Bill Cosby came from the heavens also known as my television, from the catacombs of my
father’s grave, – to remind me of how important I am.

As the audience member, I am not just the king of this court, I am the ruler and the judge. The
Balcony doesn’t exist and, I’m at front row to a catastrophe that I simply do not believe in and I have
loads of tomatoes to throw. 

It’s a good thing I prefer … potatoes…. The shit better be good. Thisstarch is good for some of you bitches.

 Peel through. 

And if you do decide to put me in a
balcony, there better be four curtains behind me, a rope there for me to jump down on– Cause
Diddy had tickets to this thing, and I have stood face to face with Cosby, his teams and his
people multiple times on and off, in my  professional child acting opportunities and jobs. I’m
watching real close.

I am a the black Arlechino, and Bill Cosby really did this bad thing and people keep talking
about, So it’s my horror story today. The Bill Cosby Story, is a horror story, and because it all
lives in my television, My papa and I’s last happy place before he went away forever.. my
opinions dictate my experience of that story…

That man who you say, did these horrible things, has hands on my body. But who cares I just
got microchipped. It’s all good. Tell me more about this man. My voice is a little different than
yours brother.
And as a black person in my affinity group which is a small group but a mixed one: Bill Cosby
has met a lot of kids. Not just black kids. He’s met a lot of kids. He might at this point be in
costume. Let’s just talk about Cosby.
I am the horror story, and the kids know. Mind you it’s not really my story. It’s the victim’s story,
and it’s Cosby’s story. It’s a network story, It’s what was what happening on the white side, and
What does Cosby mean when he says “The Dutch Man.” And points at my uncle Neal in the
back of what I presume was a dressing room??
But in Black Culture often the central focus of celebrity is not the star, but who the star
represents. I was told to root for Bill Cosby at 6 years old, the day my father died.( Microchipped
or not) I was told to cheer him on immediately about 5 years ago. I’ve been six years old with
Bill Cosby for a long time, and he has touched my skin. You are telling me to accept that a man
who has touched my very skin has rapped 60 women with his fucking wive’s help, women who
look just like me?
Ok, bitch, let’s talk — And send me to a job application to onlyfans while you’re at it.. That’s
hell!??
Jesus Fucking Christ. Ok!?
Careful what you say black man!? Cause I would scream in the street for that?
Now I’m also the dictator in the audience of the blackest bitch in the room who you can’t see.
I’m not just Arlechino, I’m just waiting to be bated to switch to Brighella any fuckin’ day now.
I am shouting back at the screen if It’s true or not, If it’s meant to be a joke ‘Cause Cosby was
the first great black comedy. On my television. A Juggernaut, My hero. My Isaiah Bradely.
Those crimes that he is accused of are what my people might call “Some ‘white people shit’”
And if he did those crimes that’s his “white” record that has nothing to do with me. Because I’m
black and he’s black, and black people don’t do things like that,,-- my guy!!!
What’s worse, if he did this, I am even further embarrassed because Cosby may have believed
that was funniest thing in the world the world to do. Which by my account, to drug and GRAPE
someone is one of the foulest acts known to man. Maybe that’s what makes it so funny. I dont
know it’s the 90’s and I just kicked syphilis.

It implicates me in his sick joke whether I believe he did it or not, because despite being
acquitted, he still stands accused by 60 women. And I saw him last year twice.
If and when it comes out, that, hypothetically, Neal Brennan has his own Cosby-esque
Skeletons, do you know who ends up being the asshole!?
Not Neal, No no no no no.
The asshole is me–
giving the standing ovation during the second showing.
Long after the skeletons are uncovered. Because I can’t believe Neal, my favorite stand up
comedian would ever do something that might require a skeleton day, that’s why I fuggs with
him. Right!?
Right.
Good thing Neal looks like a Skeleton so we know not to stand up for him at the end of his
concerts.
A true WNT about Neal: He’s most likely eating pork on Sunday. When he says Ice Cream but
he just means bacon. Damn it to hell, Neal!
Being a member of the comedic audience is living between the sense that something is off and
the scandal is breaking any day now. As a fan, I am living in between the moment the bad thing
happened which I never witnessed, and the moment the bad thing finally goes public.
As a native Angelino, I am not only familiar with that in between space, – I’m fairly addicted to it.
Neal simplifies this as “Star Fugging’” But I like to call that in-between space FOREPLAY…
And we doing Orirgies all the time.
It’s why I live here.
I believe all overtures are bullshit.
And why My first lesson in comedy was If you want to tell the truest most funny joke – just say it.
Don’t be a pansy. Tell a room full of people you think
“Bill Cosby is a Rapist”
Shout out to Hannibal Burress.

The saddest part about a story like Bill Cosby’s and the preceding and coming scandals, is that
it removes a sincere audience member’s internal sense of trust of character.
As an audience member, and an unlikely unwilling participant, the most important person in the
playspace of entertainers I can tell you is the audience, Which means having more respect for
the performers. ( My bad Bill)
This causes me to distrust and dislike myself for getting into bed with that type of person at all,
especially as a fan let alone a business partner.
Neal might be Bill Cosby’s Dutchman but to that I say I would have to “Go read that fucking
play.”
Too I was sent Another Country by James Baldwin – first.
This can insight self hatred, “This Cosby Scandal.” And I would simply prefer that scandal be
false. Therefore that hope is always my interior. Don’t fuck with my insides. Dont make me bleed
my own blood bitch, I bleed for free.
We need spaces to make our “WNTS” real for a second just to “court the scandal.” That’s
the community of ActTive Listerns developed over the HNF era.
That’s what Neal calls “ Your uncle has said crazier shit.” WNTS, That’s what we need feelers in
the community for. Feel through that shit.
When I say WNTS- I mean theoretical needs, expressed and disposed of in a safe community.
That’s what I mean.

Taking these out and living an ideology that makes me entitled to a space where the character Bill
Cosby depicted in these cases as the perpetrator is innocent but as the perpetrator in character, is
mental illness.
A WNT in Community would be the guy in front of the Laugh Factory saying to me “ Prince is not
a real Guy.”
My response in order to let him know he is safe enough to be himself in my space is to respond: 

“ Yeah that’s ok, Neal Brennan has been Michael Jackson, at least once between 2002 and
2006, [ Work it JT] and nobody knows who Eminem is.
( It’s Chris Evans, for sure. It’s Chris– Go big or go home – Happy Black History Month!)
You Rock My World Baby Dzaddy. 2:17
CLUE: The only need in regards to WNTS is reading the scifi and discerning whether or not the
need is tangible.
And the need is community.
Finding that need through a varied arrangement of exploring your WNTS is incredibly beneficial.
Therapy, an artist community, and physical hobby that is nourishing to your ugly joints. Will give
you a lot to start with.
Community is reading the scifi of the WNT before pulling dumb ass hoe ass moves. Like
slipping into NEal Brennan’s DMs or telling your ward that Jews are the reason for slavery, WTF
Kanye! !? those moves are mental illness.
Please remember that there are victims involved here. On the flip-side, were I a victim of Bill
Cosby, I imagine there was a moment of despair which was met by a moment of hope that
lunged ,e right back into despair again. Was I hypnotized, was I murdered, was I trafficked, and
where are my fucking clothes?
If I had awoken, have been drugged and takin’ advantage of in the most intimate way, by a man
with an entire world, that we all believed in– My hope would meet me with, well maybe I can be
a part of his world now too, and the despair overwhelms me once I realize that he never wants
to see me again, and I can’t find work and I have to go find work, and all I want is to be near him
just to ask his what happened last night.
Did I deserve it because I hoped he would love and care for me after that moment of harm? Or
did I deserve it because I was with this married man at all, and Does, he has the right to
judgment via taking such a grotesque action? What do you want the victims to say?

Therapy can be very sexy. The space in between to read this scifi my foreplay, These
perspectives, and a safe space to flesh them out is mental wellness.
I do defend and protect my right to the comedy communities that will agree with me in making it
possible to express that interior and exterior view of Cosby’s innocence but do so as mocktail.
If I meet a victim on the street, and have the audacity to “mock the trial,” then I better bow before
the real heroes, the women and men who came forward and didn’t stop telling the truth.
Finally and most foreboding, I perceive that the comic and entertainer’s job is to set people free
and all of that freedom is negated when that person is simultaneously poisoning and enslaving
the community at the same time.
Think about that.
Not with words alone. But with ideas → Constructed plans set into action, and beliefs that
display the behavior depicted in the Cosby case was simply “not that bad.”
Also, how much do you hate white people that Cosby has to be falsely accused all the time.
White people must suck a lot.
I just watched Zeleksy get told off by Trump. I just don’t know about white people.
Do you understand how dangerous this world is for women, let alone Black women and women
of Color? What the fuck do you want from the court system? Bill Cosby was acquitted. It’s also
ok to say about Bill Cosby Especially when not one of the 60 victims has rescinded their
testimony. That’s 60 women.
“Bill Cosby is a rapist. Happy BHM.”
I love you all so much, all 199 of you, and guests and visitors long. You are sincerely loved this
black history month.
With hope and despair, your real life mulatto equitable sex experimenter who leverages sexy
white men for global commerce on purpose.

1j2ujns,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_elowenarmstrong/comments/1j2ujns/are_we_travelling_through_time_without_realising/,Are we travelling through time without realising it?,"Time travel is a popular concept in fiction. The idea of moving into the future or past. There is no current scientific evidence that it is possible. Yet.

I’ll tell you what I think. Time is not what it seems. Better yet, it’s not what we perceive it to be. What if time, which we perceive as linear, truly is fluid, shaped by observation and consciousness? And if so - could we already be travelling through past and future, without realising?

Walk with me.

I am a philosopher which means I ask impossible questions. But I am also grounded in science, so I at least try to answer them.

My philosophical belief, in the universe’s apparent and overwhelmingly natural indifference - echoed by Sartre, Nietzsche and Camus - is grounded by science. Purely speculatively, but perhaps as logically as a philosopher does, I question whether time itself is truly linear. I think not. Not in the traditional human sense of linearity, at least.

We experience time as linear because our consciousness is structured to observe it sequentially. We know that, because we can remember yesterday, we are present now, and we are hopefully likely to wake up tomorrow. The clock ticks, and it goes forward, not backwards. But time itself, as it exists, exists on its own, and is not bound by human perception, as most things that exist truly aren’t.

We think of time, as a backdrop to events, because that’s how we perceive it. But what if it isn’t, and it behaves the same way as everything else we perceive? What if time behaves more like a force - one that seeks equilibrium, like gravity counteracting inertia? So if forces adjust to maintain balance, could time do the same?

We know that in physics, forces do not act in isolation. In classical physics, Newton’s Third Law states every action, has an equal and opposite reaction. What if time is a force, that we have simply failed to recognise? Could time, too, follow this principle then?

In our personal lives, seemingly small actions in the past, have seemingly massive ripple effects in the future - something based in chaos theory, which we also coin as as the “butterfly effect” in popular culture, why events that once were considered random, now become critical moments in hindsight. Why does it appear the universe, somewhat, course corrects, in ways we don’t immediately understand?

In physics, systems resist imbalance. Gravitational forces counteract collapse. Electromagnetic fields seek equilibrium. The fabrics of the universe appear to favour balance and will counteract imbalance, throughout every level, even on a human level.

Think about where humanity is right now. I’m specifically thinking about the climate clock, but you could be thinking about something else. I’m thinking this, because of this notion that we have limited time to save ourselves and our planet, because of climate change. It’s true, yes, but it’s a natural consequence of the current progression, a crisis. But what if climate change, is not just a “crisis” but a form of imbalance correction, a planetary response mechanism, due to disruptive human activity? The planet won’t suddenly blow up and cease to exist when it gets too hot for humans to occupy it. It could correct, by getting rid of us, the cause of the imbalance, and rebalance itself, and most likely start over until we get it right. It naturally seeks balance even on this macro, real-world level, like everything does, including on a classic physical level, on a quantum level, even on a cosmological scale.

Dark energy behaving in a way that suggests it counteracts gravitational collapse, to balance expansion and contraction. Star formation, planetary system stability and black hole event horizons operating in a way to preserve balance, as opposed to immediate decay. Electric fields adjusting dynamically to reach equilibrium, even Maxwell’s equations describe how electromagnetic fields don’t operate in isolation, they adjust to maintain field balance. In my eyes, Newton’s Third Law, present on every level, not just classical physics. So why not time, if not for the sake of linearity, governed by human perception? What if the law applies to time too?

The Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory, a favourite of mine but not accepted widely, suggested that electromagnetic waves do not just move forward in time, but also backward. This is where my philosophy, truly meets physics and asks even more questions. If time truly flowed in one direction, that should’ve been somewhat impossible, right? There would be no reason for that. But, what if Newton’s Third Law applies to time? And time is operating through a balancing mechanism, where past and future are not separate, but in continuous equilibrium, equal and opposite forces, and the Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory observed it, but didn’t realise it? What if, they didn’t interpret what they saw in all the ways they could have? What if this interaction isn’t just a mathematical curiosity, but a deeper reflection of time’s equilibrium - one we don’t yet understand? What if the Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory observed time in action, in its equilibrium, but didn’t realise it?

What if time isn’t linear, and its events aren’t randomness, but actually this unfolding of reality as we know it, is balance at play? What if time is operating through a balance mechanism, that manifests as events, not just moving in a fixed direction?

What if, every action truly has an equal and opposite? Not just in physics, but in time itself?

We know, the universe isn’t cruel or kind, it simply unfolds, and unfolds in to balance. In spirituality and pop-culture, they describe it as karma. In physics, they describe it as entropy. In my philosophy, I wonder, what if this unfolding is, as an emergent function of time, where it is correcting itself, a balance mechanism we do not yet understand?

Let’s keep talking spirituality, pop-culture and philosophy, and I’ll bring it back to physics eventually.

The “Burnt Toast Theory” on TikTok. An idea to reframe life’s inconveniences and failures within the belief that everything that happens is a part of a bigger plan for your life. The idea, that seemingly chaotic moments, actually saved you from an unknown that could potentially be even worse, and it’s understood intuitively, which is why it’s popular ie, “Just look on the bright side of things right?”.

I think I could agree with TikTok here ie “Yes, seemingly insignificant or presently disheartening moments can dramatically alter the course of the future.” But, as usual, I will always ask questions. “Why is that even something we can consider, or comprehend, in the first place?”

What if that chaotic moment, truly did happen, to truly alter the course of the future? But why? Why could the course of the future even be altered in the first place? And if it can - then how?

Now, I can talk physics again. Could time, not be forward moving, not linear? Instead, self correcting? A tiny imbalance today, triggering a massive shift in the timeline later. What if, that’s quantum entanglement in action, where two particles are linked across space and time, interpreted on human level, by the human experience? Now we can step into retrocausality.

Along this line of questioning, is time, a fixed line? Or a responsive structure? Could time, a self correcting structure, be influenced? I think, yes, we know that, quite simply intuitively without formal experiment. We know that what we do today, in the present, will affect the future. If I spill a cup of coffee on myself, I know that in the next few moments, my shirt will be wet.

When I make conscious decisions presently, I am changing the events of the future. So, can consciousness therefore manipulate time? I will take it a step further now. Time doesn’t just pass, it is something we perceive, structured by observation, consciously. What if time isn’t even a static dimension, but an emergent property of conscious observation? Or more simply put, does consciousness itself, when acted upon by time, create the very perception of the linearity of time itself?

So how far does this go? Theoretically, if we could manipulate consciousness at a deep enough level, would we theoretically manipulate time itself, and then theoretically manipulate the perception of linear events? Could we make decisions in the present that don’t only influence the future? The past doesn’t physically exist in the present - except in our memories, for now. So maybe, even influence the past too? Existing theories in quantum time mechanics come to mind, such as John Wheeler’s delayed choice experiment, the idea that decisions made in the present can retroactively change past events, and the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics, where particles can send signal backwards in time, in alignment with this concept.

I’ll tell you what I think, and ask one more question, the same one I had originally.

I don’t really think time travel is just about moving thorough space, but the manipulation of consciousness. If time is consciousness based, we could already be influencing the past, present and future, just in ways we don’t understand yet, even though we could already be seeing it when it happens. So, are we already travelling through time without realising it?",1,1741038736.0,u_elowenarmstrong,0,1.0,False

Also had a consistent low grade pain in the middle left side between the navel and ribs. Was put on PPI that came with their own problems that I wasn't even sure if was the affliction of the PPI. Also changed diet but after about a month it was still there so I was referred for an Endoscopy that I just got a few days ago and the results are actually pretty much what I expected.

I'm mostly better now with just some mild discomfort. I still avoid greasy and spicy foods, I don't drink, and had quit coffee but now just allow it as an occasional treat instead of daily. I'm off PPI and after 2 months I weened off it and did have rebound acidity for about 2 weeks. All controlled with Pepcid as needed. I still take a half of a Pepcid tablets several nights a week kind of out of paranoia if I feel any bit of unsettling. I'm over the hump but I suspect I'm prone to relapses so I will maintain this sort of diet, which really wasn't too far from my normal anyway except for the coffee and acidic condiments like mustard and vinegars.

Hi (my name)!
Hope everything is okey with you!

I've been thinking and feeling a little guilty about how I ended things.

I really hope you can look back and that it's not just bad memories but also fun ones etc. I like our memories and always will. When I look back it's only good things even though my feelings subsided. 

If you feel like talking sometime, going for a walk or coffee or whatever, let me know. 

Hugs (her name)

My response:
Hello!
Everything is good with me. 

I only have good memories of the time we spent together. 

But of course, the way you ended things hurt a lot, and it was not a good time for me. But I can't blame you for your feelings, I just wish you had been more open, and we could have talked about it instead of everything ending so abruptly. 

Hope everything is okey with you, the family, the horses and the cat. 
Hugs

Her response:
Yes, I get it. I just think it's really hard with breakups and hurting someone.

My response:
I understand that, but I actually think it made it a lot worse. I didn't understand what had happened, didn't get a real answer, and I was generally confused because I thought everything was great between us. 

But that's in the past now, nothing that can be changed. But I appreciate you writing this, so thank you.

1j2uh0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1j2uh0c/elevation_adjustment_on_aiden/,Elevation adjustment on Aiden,"So I recently realized how much the temp of my brews was being dropped by my location elevation setting.  For example, where I live is 2700ft - which typically would correspond to water boiling at 205F.  However in practice (I don't know the specifics of why) when I measure boiling water with my Thermapen, it's 207.5-208 as the high temp.   I've lately thought that some of my brews have lacked a little of the punch that I would have expected (typically just using the instant brew w/ light profile).  So I dropped my set elevation from 2700ft to 2000ft, which allowed to Aiden to brew a little hotter - stated 206 as the set temp today.  

This was the only change I made - otherwise using the same coffee with the same grind settting, and what I got in my cup just now was a significant improvement.  I feel like the elevation compensation may be dropping the temp just a bit too much.  ",2,1741038546.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False

1j2ufet,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1j2ufet/spgc_bull_thesis_and_why_im_holding_for_2_weeks/,SPGC ⛳️ Bull Thesis 📈 and why I’m holding for 2 weeks,"First post got manually removed by pennystocks-ModTeam for “pumping a stock”. So I’m changing all references to the 1st person POV.

No ChatGPT Bullshit. Just pure hopium and coffee.

First off, I’m sorry to those who are not invested in SPGC and hated hearing about it for the past month plus. I’ll just have to hear about it for another 2 weeks before this is finally done.

Let’s look at today’s price action. Opened -38% from Friday’s close. Lowest point of the day was -51%, and we gained all that ground back to barely close in the red of -9%. Find me another stock with that recovery and retail conviction!

So why did the price drop massively since Wednesday’s close?

I would say due to excessive naked shorting but others will say it’s because of the lack of investor confidence.

Some have unfortunately misinterpreted what was voted for in the Wednesday meeting, but here’s the truth. A company can only do 1 reverse split per year to hit their $1 compliance or risk getting delisted. That means that the reverse split that was approved for SPGC can only take place after July 2025.

The warrants that were bought in October and December were bought in the $3 and $2 range. Exercising them at $0.70 and below and selling all their stocks would put the early investors at a MASSIVE loss. I don’t know about anyone, but I’m here to make money.

Look at the massive amounts of short interest (more than 100%), that means that there are more shares sold than actually exists, which means short squeeze if I 👊 choose to buy and hold.

Lastly, why do I believe in this company? Google SPGC’s preliminary Q4 results, it was released In January 2025 as a little teaser of the real 10Q/ 10K that’s going to drop during their earnings report in 2 weeks. (hint: 1000%)

Also the company has filed to buy back $1M of their stocks, which means that management thinks that the stock will likely go up in price.

So I’m just going to buy and hold for another 2 weeks. If there’s anyone who has a bear 🐻 case for this, comment it and see if there are holes in my thesis! ",22,1741038433.0,pennystocks,6,0.89,False

1j2udyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1j2udyp/ex_is_emotionally_combative_toward_our_17_year/,Ex is emotionally combative toward our 17 year old... what to do?,"I was married for 18 years and have 3 children;  divorced for 8 years.  Horrible divorce that dragged on for several years.  Our oldest (31 yr old son) is very close to his dad, basically is treated like a king.  Our girls (25 and turning 17 this month) have been the object of their dad's meltdowns, tantrums and overall hostile behavior on and off since our divorce.   I am not a psychiatrist but if there is a definition of a narcissist I don't know how my ex would NOT fall into that category.   He is 65 years old by the way, not remarried, and semi retired but has a lot of money - and tries to use his money to ""buy"" people which I think is what is going on with our son.  

This is the pattern that played out with my older daughter and for the last 8 or 9 months my younger daughter:  He would act ""normal"" as in offering emotional and financial support to our girls, he would call them regularly and want to see them, would appear very loving and invested in their lives.  This behavior would last anywhere from a few months to a year.  Then inevitably there would be drama just when they thought their relationship was stable.  For instance, our older daughter couldn't go to his family reunion one year, she had a conflict but had always gone before.   My ex unexpectedly lashed out at her by text message that she was doing it on purpose to make him look bad, that a daughter who loved him would show up, and that he didn't think their relationship was a good one if she didn't attend.  When he wrote him back and said she was also sad she would have to miss it, he doubled-down and continued to berate her.  Then he continued to text her over the next few weeks telling her that he wished he could understand why she didn't love him.   She didn't text back (this type of thing had happened in the past), and ultimately he texted ""nevermind, we don't have a relationship, you can either fix it or else I don't want to see you"".   A few months went by and he began texting her random pictures of herself as a small child saying ""what happened to you?""  and occasionally texting her random pictures of her without any text at all.   Eventually he acted like nothing had happened and reached out to her ""I hope we can repair this someday"".   She finally let her guard down and they began to communicate again, which led to them meeting for dinner, and then regularly seeing each other.   That is, until the next meltdown... the cycle kept repeating for different reasons on his part but always the same pattern!   After a lot of therapy and realizing this ""ping pong"" game was way too sick, she blocked him and they didn't speak again until she and her husband had a baby last year.  My ex reached out to ask if he could see the baby- she agreed but put strict boundaries on it.  He is allowed to have short visits when her husband is present too (we believe this keeps her dad in line, having a ""witness""), and she told me if he ever stepped out of line she would never let him see the baby again.   He is abiding by the rules of course as he HAS to if he wants to see his granddaughter.

I'm very happy my older daughter has learned how to manage her relationship with her dad, who again I think is a very sick person.   But he has continued to play the game with our younger daughter.  We had 50/50 custody until she turned 16 and was able to choose NOT to live with his shifting emotions;  she initially would go to see him over weekends but that become intolerable to her (she said he was treating her like she was his therapist, rehashing our divorce over and over, and just being incredibly selfish by forcing her to go out to dinner with him and his obnoxious alcoholic friends).  So she pared it back even more.   She asked him if they could just meet for coffee which they did twice.  He asked her why she won't come back to live with him at least part of the time and when she was honest with him and told him, he got mad and later texted her ""you obviously don't care about me"".   Knowing what her sister went through, my younger daughter stopped engaging and no longer responded to him when he put out the ""bait"" to draw her back in.   Because she didn't engage, he started to send her text messages out of the blue proactively telling her not to expect to have a relationship with him-  to underscore that, just before Xmas he sent out holiday invitations to our kids/family for Xmas day and then quickly texted our younger daughter to say ""you're not invited by the way"".   Incredibly mean things like that!  As a result, our older daughter decided not to go even though she was invited, just sickened over the way he was treating her younger sister.   

It's heartbreaking to see a man treat his kids this way-  since our younger daughter is almost 17, I am trying to figure out how best to advise her or if I even should or need to advise her.  She has a therapist who is helpful but I also think that therapist doesn't fully grasp this extreme behavior.   Maybe I'm doing enough just by being there for my daughter and her sister provides support as well.   She is also aware that her dad doesn't provide any financial support - everything is on me because my ex happens to LOVE legal drama and if I took him to court to pay child support it would cost more in legal fees than he would have to give me.  He is very adept at hiding his assets and I know from during our divorce that it would never benefit me by the time I paid the legal fees so I just stretch myself to pay for everything - now that she drives, I have bought her a car and pay for car insurance, plus expensive classes to prepare for the SAT, a summer college class she will be taking, etc.   And as  I did for my older daughter, I will end up paying for college entirely myself even though my ex has way more money than I do.   

The level of cruelty is just heartbreaking and if she was 10 I would seek sole custody but she's almost an adult and already lives with me.   He began exhibiting this more extreme behavior with our older daughter after our divorce when she was also around the same age.  It's like he is able to somewhat contain himself when they are young enough that I could take them out of the situation and as soon as he feels comfortable that's not an issue, he unleashes such anger.  I just don't want my younger daughter to have to endure this.  I truly think some day he will ""have"" to respect boundaries with her just like he now does with my older daughter - because he will want some level of access to a grandchild.   Or maybe he will need a nurse in his older years and suddenly have a revelation, who knows, but in the meantime I don't know what if anything I can do.   He still texts my younger daughter once in a while to remind her that she's responsible for them not seeing each other, it's almost like he is talking to a partner.  Again she doesn't respond but just having those messages turn up on her phone is so heartbreaking.",0,1741038329.0,Parenting,0,0.5,False

This was a cute TikTok. And then I turned to see how it played out in my life.  

Just this morning, I told my husband I was in a terrible mood and that I would go for the morning workout.  

He saw me upset and said yes. Then he asked what I was going to do after I got back. I said, “I don’t know, apply for jobs, I guess.”  

I went to work out, came back home, took a shower, and went to my office room (which is usually cold because it’s on the lowest level). But today, it was warm. My laptop was charging.  

He came down with a cup of coffee and said, “Here you go.”  

I just looked at him and then at the heater.  

He said, “I don’t know, you were already upset. I didn’t want you to be cold too.”  

“Fall in love with the person who, if they lose the ability to express love in words, you could still feel their love. Because it doesn’t matter what people say; what matters is what they do.”  

Did my husband say he loved me today? No, he didn’t.  

Did I feel it? 100%.

And I sat down with the cup of warm coffee, in a warm room, feeling slightly better. If I had to practice gratitude, it will be for this man in my life.

It has worked really well for months. Apparently I got a little too comfortable and cocky. Last night instead of eating 12 corn chips with salsa, I just kept eating them, like I did in the BT times (before tirzepatide). Big mistake. Side effects back. All my fault. 

I’m in my 9th month and have lost 80lb. But last night the binge eating behavior just came roaring back. It was really interesting because even though I was going through the motion, the chips didn’t taste good or bring comfort, so the tirzepatide was working. It happened because I got too tired and I’m under stress. I delayed today’s dose a bit but just because I couldn’t move. It’d 2:30pm and I’m just having my morning coffee/protein shake. 

Good lesson to learn again, I guess. It was the first time I’ve purposely overeaten since I started tirzepatide on June 18, 2024. Won’t be eating corn chips again for a long while. I know since the food noise is back that I need to dose up a bit, but I put that off until the side effects subside.

Am I reaching for the stars or the void with this?,"So it started in summer of 2023, we met online, got off great and were glued for months. She was then as she is now, alluring, intelligent, funny and attractive with looks and personality (bubbly, witty, smooth). After about 4 we officially became a couple though things changed fast. From around October (-23) right through till the end of January (-24) felt like everything we'd grew was just no longer there, the talks of dates, meets, adventures, pets, everything you could imagine just gone.. We split about 4/5 months later and went no contact.

January of this year we reconnected, identified that we would need to communicate before starting a relationship again, we outlined some boundaries to keep from both of us. No relationship, exclusive, nothing sexual, open to relationship memes/videos gifs that sort of thing.

She knew what direction I wanted us to go in and voiced that she needed time before we would commit to the big talk about us and the future. From then till now has been a journey..

We seemed to bond and connect well, we called and laughed for hours, figured out ways for us to connect and play games together. Everything was close, everything was happy and this time it seemed calm, it felt honest but most importantly it felt genuine. 'It felt', well that all switched went full uturn. Cold, distant, only responding not talking or engaging.

Ended up with this weekend in silence of each other, we spoke last night and it started as that she can't see us having a future at all. This was in response to a video I sent her (video context: a relationship 'I want you as my last of everything' type list).

We continued to speak, from my perspective the chat seemed calm and open.. But honestly, maybe just dead? I mentioned to her that we have spent the last 2 months together always delaying the chat of an us.. And then throwing it away because things don't feel right..

I told her early on when we reconnected that my main problem, is that I have to let go of the past, I haven't told her what it is exactly that I need to let go of however it's purely the fact that I'm still to this day convinced she has no idea why I wrote her a letter forcing us into a 2 week break at the start February (-24). It was the switch up.. The 'I don't have 5 minutes to eat food/ drink tea or coffee with you' the fact that I sat patiently for 5 months of our relationship..

Maybe if she could just understand it, it's a year ago I have no attachment. My distain from it comes with the fact I'm not even sure she's paying any mind to me or us. It comes over as a sort of 'I need a pick me up let me go cosy up' type of deal.

Well when we spoke last night we agreed to give it one more week, try and talk and if no different then it's time to go our own way.

We spoke today, alot more than I said I would anyway. She's been present, fast replies typically 20mins to an hour.. Too much advice these days is 'just break up and move on' am I reaching for stars or the void right now?

Do I continue to push for what I want? One line that she said last night stuck with me hard ""I don't want to let you go but you know.."". Well I don't know and I want to ask her, I'm just deflated. I've been trying at this for what feels like a long time. We both have regrets and wanted to do things differently. Could she be hiding something more? Could it really be dead? Could she just be distracted by the pretty big irl stresses, if I'm being honest she has so much going on right now irl. 

I just want to continue being her rock for her to lean on, I'm doubting whether it's even worth my time anymore

I was competent in the work required, was just starting to actually get some real ownership roles in projects and really clicked with my co-workers. Free coffee, subsidized food in a work canteen, could work from home pretty much whenever I wanted, the whole 9 yards really. Then there was a round of redundancy and honestly I just took the money because it was *too good* of an offer for the couple of years I'd been there.

After a small career break I've started a new job for the past few weeks which *on paper* should be a real step up for me. The salary is massively improved (+35%), and the progression opportunities are probably better in the long term with a lot of the people I've met having worked there for 10+ years. 

The issue is honestly that the environment is just killing me. The organization is so much larger and I feel disconnected from everything else, my colleagues are not at all in the same demographic with half the department being near retirement and uninterested in forming any new social ties and the office area itself is just... not as nice? The building is much older and everything is just a bit run down. Coupled with losing a lot of the other ""niceties"" like free coffee, really flexible working arrangements and honestly the more chill vibe, this new role just feels oppressive in a way I can't quite put into words.

Even typing this I feel whiny! I know it shouldn't be a big deal but I really didn't expect the number of small differences to make me feel this way or that just the general *look* of the office would affect me. I suppose I'm realizing that I was maybe just spoiled by my first role and perhaps I shouldn't expect those things again? It just feels like I made the wrong choice because I really could have seen myself staying for *years* had nothing changed, but I prioritized the money over my current life satisfaction.

Brings me to the purpose of the post in that I've never had to ever actually consider *quitting* a job before, all my previous jobs just sort of ended 'naturally', let alone looking for a new role just a few weeks after starting a big new one. I guess what I'm asking is how do you mentally handle that after such a short period of time and am I being stupid to let the small stuff get to me?",2,1741037881.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

She was then as she is now, alluring, intelligent, funny and attractive with looks and personality (bubbly, witty, smooth). After about 4 we officially became a couple though things changed fast. From around October (-23) right through till the end of January (-24) felt like everything we'd grew was just no longer there, the talks of dates, meets, adventures, pets, everything you could imagine just gone.. We split about 4/5 months later and went no contact.

January of this year we reconnected, identified that we would need to communicate before starting a relationship again, we outlined some boundaries to keep from both of us. No relationship, exclusive, nothing sexual, open to relationship memes/videos gifs that sort of thing.

She knew what direction I wanted us to go in and voiced that she needed time before we would commit to the big talk about us and the future. From then till now has been a journey..

We seemed to bond and connect well, we called and laughed for hours, figured out ways for us to connect and play games together. Everything was close, everything was happy and this time it seemed calm, it felt honest but most importantly it felt genuine. 'It felt', well that all switched went full uturn. Cold, distant, only responding not talking or engaging.

Ended up with this weekend in silence of each other, we spoke last night and it started as that she can't see us having a future at all. This was in response to a video I sent her (video context: a relationship 'I want you as my last of everything' type list).

We continued to speak, from my perspective the chat seemed calm and open.. But honestly, maybe just dead? I mentioned to her that we have spent the last 2 months together always delaying the chat of an us.. And then throwing it away because things don't feel right..

I told her early on when we reconnected that my main problem, is that I have to let go of the past, I haven't told her what it is exactly that I need to let go of however it's purely the fact that I'm still to this day convinced she has no idea why I wrote her a letter forcing us into a 2 week break at the start February (-24). It was the switch up.. The 'I don't have 5 minutes to eat food/ drink tea or coffee with you' the fact that I sat patiently for 5 months of our relationship..

Maybe if she could just understand it, it's a year ago I have no attachment. My distain from it comes with the fact I'm not even sure she's paying any mind to me or us. It comes over as a sort of 'I need a pick me up let me go cosy up' type of deal.

Well when we spoke last night we agreed to give it one more week, try and talk and if no different then it's time to go our own way.

We spoke today, alot more than I said I would anyway. She's been present, fast replies typically 20mins to an hour.. Too much advice these days is 'just break up and move on' am I reaching for stars or the void right now?

Do I continue to push for what I want? One line that she said last night stuck with me hard ""I don't want to let you go but you know.."". Well I don't know and I want to ask her, I'm just deflated. I've been trying at this for what feels like a long time. We both have regrets and wanted to do things differently. Could she be hiding something more? Could it really be dead? Could she just be distracted by the pretty big irl stresses, if I'm being honest she has so much going on right now irl. 

I just want to continue being her rock for her to lean on, I'm doubting whether it's even worth my time anymore

Nobody else we knew/know drank it and we don’t know how it made its way into our family.

So far I have:

\- Despite being called Scandinavian, it seems like it might just be a Midwestern American thing - I live in Europe now and not a single Scandinavian I’ve ever talked to has heard of it

\- I contacted the church that sells egg coffee at the Minnesota State Fair ages ago and they sent me a scan of their recipe but didn’t have any information on the history

\- There are brief references to egg coffee in the book The Exorcist (1971) and the film Spellbound (1945)

Any information beyond this would be greatly appreciated. Anybody know where it actually came from? How was it popular enough to be a cultural reference in the mid-20th century but most people have never heard of it?",5,1741037658.0,AskFoodHistorians,10,1.0,False

Those included an initial set of tariffs on about C$30 billion ($20.6 billion) worth of goods from US exporters — including orange juice, peanut butter, wine and coffee — and a second tranche on C$125 billion of products, including cars, trucks, steel and aluminum, which would come into effect in a few weeks.

She wasn’t into it - felt like it was too complex and said she prefers her simple overnight-refrigerator-soak cold brew, and an occasional flavored keurig pod.   But since I also went to to local roaster and got 2# of freshly roasted beans as part of the gift I figured I’d leave it on the counter a while and maybe try to use up those beans?

I’m not a coffee drinker at all, but since she wasn’t going to use it, I decided to try it myself - and now I’m flat hooked on the cappuccino it makes, and have been getting into tinkering with the other drinks as well.   So plot twist- the Keurig might be a goner because I took over its counter space in our small kitchen. 

As a non-coffee drinker, I’ve been trying to learn more of the processes and nuances of various espresso methods/techniques, and trying to equate them to what the settings on this machine actually do.   Some are straight forward - water temp, drink size, strength, but I can’t figure out wtf this “aroma” setting is changing?  It definitely produces a different drink between the top and bottom (of 3) settings, but how/why?  Anyone know what it’s doing in there?

As an aside, I couldn’t find much actual user-produced content on this machine at all, just bot-farm videos or marketing clips on YouTube.   In contrast to the mountains of KF7/8 videos the KA marketing machine has been able to flood the market with.    Watching some of those videos, it seems like the machines are nearly identical in settings and capabilities (with the exception of the removable hopper and bypass - which I’m not sure i would use, especially since I’d have to purge/waste between every swap).  I paid full price for the Bosch at Costco hoping it will go on sale again soon, and did so because of the Costco return policy in case the gift was a dud.   But since I’m now ready to die on the hill of having this or a similar machine, the KF8 with a nearly identical feature set for a few hundred bucks cheaper (assuming I’d find an insider discount) is intriguing.  I like the idea of a metal cabinet vs plastic - but I also like the years long Costco return window, so I’m torn. Any advice from the seasoned veterans in this audience would be appreciated.

First off, I’m sorry to those who are not invested in SPGC and hated hearing about it for the past month plus. You’ll just have to hear about it for another 2 weeks before this is finally done.

Let’s look at today’s price action. Opened -38% from Friday’s close. Lowest point of the day was -50%, and we gained all that ground back to barely close in the red of -9%. Find me another stock with that recovery and retail conviction!

So why did the price drop massively since Wednesday’s close?

I would say due to excessive naked shorting but others will say it’s because of the lack of investor confidence.

Some have unfortunately misinterpreted what was voted for in the Wednesday meeting, but here’s the truth. A company can only do 1 reverse split per year to hit their $1 compliance or risk getting delisted. That means that the reverse split that was approved for SPGC can only take place after July 2025.

The warrants that were bought in October and December were bought in the $3 and $2 range. Exercising them at $0.70 and below and selling all their stocks would put the early investors at a MASSIVE loss. I don’t know about you, but I’m here to make money.

Look at the massive amounts of short interest (more than 100%), that means that there are more shares sold than actually exists, which means short squeeze if YOU 👊 choose to buy and hold.

Lastly, why do I believe in this company? Google SPGC’s preliminary Q4 results, it was released In January 2025 as a little teaser of the real 10Q/ 10K that’s going to drop during their earnings report in 2 weeks. (hint: 1000%)

So I’m just going to buy and hold for another 2 weeks. If there’s anyone who has a bear 🐻 case for this, comment it and see if you can poke holes in my thesis! ",17,1741036637.0,Shortsqueeze,4,0.9,False

Where are your MC and Cove now?



Oh my gosh, HI ! It’s so good to see you ! I haven’t seen you since the wedding ! Do you have time for a coffee ? Great, sit down and I’ll bring you up to speed!

Here’s your coffee and a nice bagel and cream cheese. I thought you might be hungry.



So it’s been two years now since we saw you at the wedding. So much has changed! Where to begin ? I’m guessing by this time that you can guess that I have good news by the smile plastered on my face.



Well, Cove is doing absolutely fantastic ! Somethings in our life have really let him live out his passions. I’m going to keep the big reveal secret for a moment if you don’t mind. Don’t want to give it away too early. He is working full time at ORCA, he’s now a manager in charge of guest services and the lead for the Recovery Department. That’s where injured sealife is brought in for medical treatment and rehab before they are released. Do you remember hearing about that pod of beached dolphins that were found just outside of Sunset Bird last month ? My sweet husband was right there helping to retrieve the injured ones and getting the others set back out to sea. He personally worked under the direction of the veterinarian who cared for the dolphins that they took in ! He was so proud ! I was so proud ! I’m like “that’s my hubby !”



He has opened up so much from his early days. I’ve been at his side constantly

working with him on his social skills and he’s absolutely blossomed ! It’s a far cry from the shy little boy that he was. What’s that ? No, it’s not because of me. He’s done this on his own. I’m just his cheerleader and support system. He says otherwise but , ok , I gave him confidence but he’s worked so hard. You would not know that he was Autistic. I am so proud of him ! Every day I fall deeper and deeper in love with him. He’s my rock and my safe haven in life.



Oh and guess what ?! We are daddies now ! Can you believe it ? I have a big Covey and a little Covey now ! His name is Benny ! He is SO MUCH like his father ! No, not me...Cove ! Yeah, well we adopted him from an orphanage. It was one for children with non-traditional learning abilities. He does have Autism and we believe he may be dyslexic. No, I could not be so selfish as to have a biological child when there are so many kids already out there that need homes. Cove agreed with me. He was SO SWEET ! He came right up to us and wanted hugs. We didn’t choose him, he chose us. I mean, it wasn’t even like that, it was more like, you recognized your family and went to them. The moment he snuggled into my neck after I picked him up my heart nearly broke. Then I saw Cove looking at us with tears streaming from his beautiful blue eyes, the proudest of proud fathers and I lost it. I was crying, Cove was crying, Benny was completely lost as to what was happening ! We couldn’t sign the papers fast enough. He came home and all is right with the world. We have Benny homeschooling to meet his needs. Yeah, I’m with him along with his teacher. We decided that for his needs, the teacher will come to the house for him as long as he needs. We’re not rushing him. I’ve retired so that is not a problem. Oh, I’m 26. Yeah, I know it’s a big young to retire but I’ll get to that soon.



Cliff is doing great ! He’s seeing someone and they are getting on like a house on fire ! Could we be hearing wedding bells ? Maybe ! Oh and more good news, Kyra got remarried ! We flew out to Nevada and we had a blast ! Kyra’s new husband is the salt of the earth. He took to his new step son like a duck to water but then , who couldn’t love Cove ? Amiright ?! Yeah, I’m biased as his husband, what’s your point ? My moms are doing great ! They’ve both cut back their work loads and one’s gone remote and the other is part-time.

Yeah, well their jobs always paid well and they invested wisely so good on them. Plus, they had a little help from a guardian angel.



Lizzie is good, she’s just working away. No, I don’t think she’s dating at the moment. We don’t keep in touch as much as when we lived together. She moved a few towns over from Sunset Bird into Willowvale. Well, you know that people in “The ‘Vale’” are kind of bougie. I think that she likes to run with that crowd. No, I’m not being disparaging, I love my sister. She just gravitates towards the more affluent crowd where Covey and I are just well, basic. We don’t seek that stuff out to be happy. We have each other and now our son.



Oh the SurfShop is doing great ! Some guy has actually bought up the waterfront district and the boardwalk and rumor is that he’s redeveloping the whole area to take advantage of Sunset Bird’s beautiful coastline and ocean front access ! Curiosity is driving a lot of people to Cliff’s shop because he’s one of the original store owners still left. Well, you know how people love a good gossip and they trust Cliff. While he has them hostage, as it were, he sells them quite a bit of merchandise. Natural born saleman ! I love Cliff so much. He’s literally the father I never had. Well, yeah. That would make Cove my brother but let’s not go there ! He’s the greatest person I could ever have for a father-in-law !



Our friend Derek is still around, still buff as all get out ! My cousin Lee came to visit for a whole month last year. I swear that she, Cove and I never stopped laughing ! It was so good to be able to see her for so long. Benny was her constant shadow always wanting “uppies” as he calls it. I teased her each time I saw it by saying “someone’s giving off mommy vibes” or by slyly asking “Could you pass the salt, Mommy, please ?” You should have seen the black and blue marks on my shin from when she kept kicking me ! All in good fun but I think she’d make a great mom. Or it could be that our beautiful child brings it out in people.



Me ? Well, mostly I’m the same. Loving my beautiful husband more and more every day. Loving our child and just enjoying our idyllic life. Yeah. Hmmm ? What else ? Oh, I won the lottery. Yes, I’m serious. No, it’s not a joke. Well, nothing personal but I’m not going to tell you exactly how much but let’s say north of $250 million. We were in shock too ! I wasn’t going to lead with that news, you wouldn’t have heard a word I said after that. It’s called a buildup ! Well, Cove is actually retired. He does still go to work at ORCA but he donates his time. He always loved the job but now he doesn’t have to worry about taking time off or being out sick. He does it when he wants to. So that’s a lot of stress off, not having to work to pay bills. Benny’s teachers and whatnot are paid directly by me. No, we decided that we weren’t going to mess around with insurance. That’s too much of a hassle and they are always cheaping out on you. Our son gets the best help we can afford. Oh and I’m the guy who bought the waterfront. It’s going to be rehabbed into a place where tourists can visit, locals will have a nice place to dine and shop.



Oh it’ll be tasteful. We’ll have intersting things like we will only use flowers and plants native to this area for decoration. Free music from live bands in the evening. Drone “fireworks” at night.



Well, I chose drones for that because they are more environmentally friendly. No waste into the ocean, GPS so they can be retrieved in case they crash and they will be powered from a solar battery bank. Yeah I wanted to be respectful of my hubby’s concerns for the environment, especially the sealife so I went with drones instead of traditional fireworks. It is going to be a big investment but what I am aiming to do is two fold: increase the quality of life for the residents of Sunset Bird but also be a get away destination from people from The Vale and also Driftwood Pines. They are an afflulent community too.

I feel confident that the money will come back to us very quickly when our neighbors see the new and improved Sunset Bird and its quaint little seaside town-ness. We’ll have restaurants, a small high end shopping area and attractions. I want to build a free attraction called Cove’s Ocean Odyssey. It’ll be a marine setting with touch tanks and tubes for fish to swim through, with specia lighting and sound to make you feel like you are underwater. I’ve asked Cove to narrate the walk-thru where he can talk about keeping our coral reefs healthy, reduce waste in the water and protect marine life.



He’s very excited about it!I’m also going to buy six boats for multi-function use. During the day and at night, they will be free water taxis that bring people back and forth from The Vale and Driftwood Pines to here.



However, at night, we will reduce the number of taxis down to three. The other three will be for romantic dinner cruises. Do you remember how good the food at our wedding was ? Well, they will be our caterers. When he’s ready to retire, I’m buying the surf shop from Cliff to keep it in the family for Benny and his partner. Cliff agreed to get his captain’s license and be in charge of our little armada. He’s tickled pink !



It’s going to be a lot of work, sure but when you get a blessing like this, you’ve got to jump at it. I really don’t want to sit back and just count our money. I figure if it can help my family and the local economy then do it. Oh, yes, we did give money to the family. More than enough, let’s say. WAY more than enough. Also, I have my eye on a huge plot of land on the East Side of town. I’ve been thinking of buying it to build a small industrial park there. We’d lease it out to companies that agree with our “green” ideals like at least 60% solar, no toxic emissions, etc. Again, jobs creation and growing our money.



You’re right, a lot has changed. Also, things are very much the same. I’m still in love with my childhood best friend. We fall deeper and deeper in love all the time. I love my husband and my son with all my heart and soul. They are at the very heart of everything I do. This is our love, this is Our Life from the Beginning and for Always. I wouldn’t have it any other way. Thanks for listening ! It was so good to see you again. No, no, don’t worry about it. The coffee and bagel are on us.

I’m currently at S1 E7, about to go into the season 1 finale and .. I still don’t quite know what to make of this show 😂

no spoilers from you guys of course please but let’s discuss: going in I was expecting it to be a sci fi-horror with paranormal shit going on in that town for some reason.. I don’t know why but I always associated the show’s title with mystery and while watching the whole atmosphere just felt kinda sus however as the show kept going I was totally surprised that it’s more of a.. (high school) drama ? I don’t know how to describe it. It’s weird..

I watched 7 episodes so far and nothing really ""happened” all that much plot progression wise but I’m still intrigued since there are things I noticed that feel kinda off.. I need to know, is it just me over- analysing because I want something to happen or am I actually catching on to something..

1.	⁠Despite being 7 episodes in and spending equally enough time with this quite huge cast of characters I have the feeling that I still know nothing about these characters whatsoever..I know what is going on ""with"" them, sure, but I don’t ""know"" these people 👀.. every single one of these characters behaves so random, almost like they’re not real people. It’s almost like these people only play a role that they were given without being able to ""break character”, you know? But sometimes there are these raaandom ass little moments where they do behave out of character, almost like there’s a glitch in the matrix. Scenes that come to mind are the baguette eating scene with Audrey’s dad .. huh? why?😂, then the fish being in the coffee how? why?, Audrey (at least I think?!) breaking the fourth wall talking about ""the music"" that was part of the soundtrack and dancing to it, Bobby randomly crying all of a sudden having a full on mental breakdown, Laura’s parents’ weird hallucinations, Agent Cooper’s strange dream 1/2 episodes ago— yeah all of that, that one colleague of Sheriff Truman not being able to handle a gun/ dropping his gun and not being fitting for the job in a way, Sheriff Truman behaving weirdly after being caught by Cooper bingeing on the donuts as If he just committed a hate crime or something, Cooper addressing a Diane during his voice recorder memos, Nadine with her mysterious eye patch and neurotic behavior and so on..
2.	⁠Laura. It seems like she is the only one that is aware that she’s ""the protagonist"" of a tv show.. talking about ""how all men like her and think she’s sexy” and all that. Then James’ reaction to seeing Laura’s cousin and pointing out how they look exactly alike almost like they actually are the same person and Laura’s actress just got ""re-cast”
3.	⁠Food. This is noticeable with Agent Cooper. He mentions every. damn. episode at least 2 times how much he loves black coffee and how great the pie is as If he’s payed to say that or something by the way all he ever seem to eat is pie, coffee and doughnuts and you see the characters bingeing on these almost as If that’s all they get to eat all day
4.	⁠The color red. First noticed it with Audrey’s dad’s ATROCIOUS red polka dot tie and all of a sudden red was everywhere: red curtains, red drinks, red lipstick, red phone, red doors, red straw in drink, red car, red present box at the parfumerie, red shirts, red blood dripping on the doughnuts after Waldo (the bird) got shot and so on. No way this is not intentional.
5.	⁠The evil. A couple episodes ago it was randomly mentioned there’s a ""mysterious evil in these woods” to agent Cooper, Laura also said “it would draw her back to the woods, she knows it would” yet no one ever addressed it again and agent Cooper didn’t seem to care either😂
6.	⁠not having a sense of space and time. I noticed we only ever see these characters at different locations but barely get to see how they actually get there which leaves a disorienting feel of how big Twin Peaks actually is and where everything is located, you know?
7.	⁠The soundtrack. I mentioned how Audrey was seemingly dancing to the soundtrack before but the whole soundtrack in itself is weird since most of the time it’s just elevator music or the theme song playing over and over again..
8.	⁠Invitation to love. I hope that’s the title but I mean the weird tv show everyone keeps watching and that we see more clips of every episode.. what’s up with that..👀
9.	⁠Birds. Yeah.. they keep mentioning birds. Not only is the first image of the intro a bird but Laura seemingly had bird markings on her dead body, Waldo (the bird) was allegedly witness to the crime, If I remember correctly during Laura’s funeral or at another point they kept cutting to a black raven/ crow, they were talking about owls and one of the characters (I think the Sherriff or his colleague?) said he was scared of birds..

yeah to sum it all up: it feels very Truman Show- esque

Am I tripping or am I on to something with my assumptions?😂

I'm thinking Niche zero, DF64, Mignon, and probably loads of others that I'm not thinking of atm. What are the equivalents for espresso machines?

I'm just getting into the hobby and have settled on one of the above grinders (or a coworker might give me a steal on a Sette 270, which I wouldn't otherwise buy). For machines, I'm facing much more analysis paralysis. What are the machine equivalents to the above grinders? 99% of the time, I'll be drinking espressos and cortados and won't be making more than two milk drinks back to back. I'm used to waking up an pouring a cup from an SCA-certified drip machine that kicks on 30 mins before I wake up. I'm willing to do a bit of work/waiting, but ideally, not a 10+ minute warmup time + pulling/steaming.

I don't currently drink light roasts, but I could see myself becoming the coffee nerd that eventually *does* drink them, so I'd rather spend a bit more now to get something capable of brewing specialty coffee later. Bambino+ seems like it would be great, but Lance Hedricks' video on it was a bit ambiguous as to whether you can do light roasts after purging for temp. stability. Bambino+ is on the lower end of the budget, but the competition in that range otherwise seems to be single boilers, and my understanding is they'd all require substantial warmup time. Ascaso seems like the next best option, but it's significantly higher-price-if I went that way, is that the ""good"" Bambino plus? Is there some other machine that warms up sufficiently quickly to pull a shot in the AM or when taking a quick break when WFH?

**Given the above, what would you recommend?**

For larger volumes/entertaining, which will be super infrequent, I'm thinking of getting an external milk frother or something. Since I assume dual boilers will be out of my budget, this seems like the best option for making 4+ drinks without going insane--something like the Nespresso Aeroccino.

This time no such luck, it is 27 years I have been smoking and I know I will think about it at least once a day for the rest of my life.

Only have about 2 beers a day but I quit those too, double whammy. The beer I don't really care about except for the insomnia it cures but I am constantly wanting to inhale that warm smoke.....perhaps I should vape? I heard things like ""popcorn lung"" so trying not to justify getting a vaping machine. I only smoked about 1 roll up every hour and the way I roll them up it works out like 1 cigarette smoked 1/3 at a time every 3 hours but still if you smoke your immune system is damaged and remains so and that means wearing a face mask at the shops and looking like the only twit to be still doing that.

New York marathon

I am a vagabond at Heart and a passionate walker at night
I march through every city I visit, and dream myself marching through all the city’s I have never
visited
I am the brown horse between the cyclists in France and I write storys and poems in languages I
don’t recognise any longer
I walk through fields of golden brown and bright green clover
I am running around angrily searching for happiness or a gun or a coffee place
I travel endless Roads and highways in order to reach the forgotten gates of Eden just to find that its
empty and all its fruits and plants are dry
There is nothing in life that’s not achievable except youth
My trophy’s are blisters and bloody socks
There is dirt from all around the world on my once white sneakers
I felt restless in London and agitated in Vienna
My body was electrified in southwest Italy and the waves in Greece had me unsettled
I jumped out of a cap in Knightsbridge and ran all the way to Oxford street
I ran away
until one day I ended up in the white room with a white bed and a small window and nothing but
sickness and pain
And that’s when I realised every race has to end

1j2tdsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Braves/comments/1j2tdsr/vip_package_at_cooltoday_park/,VIP Package at CoolToday Park,"This is a write up of the experience my husband and I had with the VIP package at CoolToday Park on 2 MAR 2025. The Braves were playing the Yankees, the game started at 1:05 PM. 

We arrived at the parking lot around 9:45 AM, there were signs pointing to the VIP check in so it was easy to find. When we got to the tent to check in it was 9:50. We were given both a lanyard with a small placard that had the date on it, and also a ribbon wrist bracelet. I was not familiar with the ribbon bracelet thing - definitely don’t over tighten them since it’s super hard to loosen it (you’ll need to either twist it or use a straw hack to loosen it). There were around 40 folks ahead of us already lined up. They scanned both our ticket for the VIP experience and our game ticket. A few parties came in after us, but we were definitely one of the last to arrive. I’m guessing about 50-55 people get to buy the VIP package (it was sold out when we went). They started letting us in right at 10 and went through Security. 

We entered through the LECOM Legends Club, and they already had some food out but everyone was already beelining to batting practice. Even though we were one of the last parties to check in, my husband and I still got to stand right up against the temporary white picket fence they put up behind home plate to watch batting practice. The view of the players is amazing! At some points during the morning there were a lot of guests in the space and the crowd would sometimes get two deep in a few places. 

Olson, Ellis, and Cooper were doing BP already when we all arrived. My husband is the baseball fan (me less so) and I left to grab some food in the club while he stayed to watch BP. He did get a signature from Ellis and only one other Braves player gave out signatures. The other player only signed for kids. I heard from other folks that they got signatures from Snitker the other day but he didn’t sign when we were there. Signatures definitely seem to be hit and miss.

Once the Braves were done with BP (around 10:40), most of the crowd came into the club to get breakfast. They had biscuits and gravy, sausage, eggs, tater tots, bacon, fruit, and donut holes. The food was tasty and the hot food was kept warm. There was also a popcorn machine and M&Ms and Reese Pieces. Beer and wine were free, they also had a jug for OJ, coffee, and water. Bottled water was not free, it was four bucks. 

The crowd mostly went back outside when the Yankees started BP around 11:15. Their players were much more generous with signatures, about five or six folks came by the VIP section to sign, including Aaron Boone. Sorry I’m not a baseball fan myself so apologies for being bad with names! 

In order to get to your seats you have to go up one deck - there’s a stairwell that’s less crowded (exit out of the main entrance to the club) otherwise you need to take the stairs next to one of the seating sections which can get crowded with people (near where you watch BP). You can come and go to the club anytime you want throughout the game. We visited once during the game so my husband could grab a beer, they also have bathrooms in there which are much less crowded than the ones in the park. 

I was a little disappointed in the food selection….I expected them to switch the food out for lunch fare but the only addition for lunch were cut up hot dogs. The breakfast food stayed out the whole time. They also stopped replenishing the food, so the food would eventually disappear and wouldn’t be replaced with anything else. 

One major pro was that the club is open one hour past the end of the game. So we went back and relaxed there as we waited for the parking lot to clear out a bit. We left about 35 minutes past the end of the game and we got out of the parking lot in a few minutes.

The staff at the park were absolutely amazing! Everyone was very friendly and easy to talk to and they were very attentive. 

I’d caution anyone doing the VIP package to manage your expectations for signatures. Overall though, I think it was well worth the money! The lounge was a nice spot to relax and get some grub, and it was pretty nice to watch BP that close. I would do it again the next time we make it to Spring Training!

For some context I’ve been very sick over the past month with one A&E admission and three different courses of antibiotics. Today was my first time going out, to the cinema by myself. Some things led to my heightened anxiety (obviously health fears, anxiety about going out which has increased while I’ve been bed bound, didn’t eat enough in the morning, had a coffee, mixing medications and I smoked some weed before the cinema). 

I was fine during the adverts and really excited to see the film, but about 2 minutes in I don’t know why but the panic attack triggered then. I started thinking about the medications I had mixed, wondering if they interact negatively. Then my heart started racing. 

My heart rate is typically lower than the standard, so I noticed as soon as it started beating quicker. I tried to distract myself with the movie and with deep breaths, but after another 5 minutes it literally felt like my heart was going to break out of my chest. I thought “oh my god, I’m going to die here”. I grabbed my stuff and sat in the foyer of the cinema. My heart hadn’t really calmed down much, so I called my dad to ask if he thought I should call 999. 

He reassured me, going through my symptoms and told me to just wait and see. 20 minutes later my heart had slowed a bit, and I felt less like I was going to die. I tried to go back into the cinema, but I felt so sensitive to sound and light that just stepping back inside made my heart race again. I left and got an uber home. 

When I’ve had panic attacks before, it’s really been like hyperventilating and a fuzzy mind - not like a full on heart attack. After that, I’m starting to wonder if I have even had panic attacks in the past. It happened hours ago and my chest still hurts a bit. 

Learned my lesson a bit not to push myself right now when I’m so sensitive. ",1,1741035560.0,PanicAttack,0,1.0,False

Arthur Gallagher insurance heavy into buying up local small insurance companies. I would say they are billionaires so they contribute to Trump. 
Look at your group insurance at your workplaces and tell employer u would like them to switch. Car and house insurance not sure how many local or Canada wide insurance companies there are but even if we moved a 5000 policies Canada wide.  They would get the point. 


Tesla. But we already know that VW seems to be investing in Canada so maybe a car from them. 


Costco. Yes I know this is a touchy subject. But maybe we could strike a deal where they only buy Canada made hotdogs for there canteen. Or have a section of local meats and cheeses. Yes stock might be limited but everything helps a small business. Or even a section of Canada manufactured products . Section for locally brewed coffee or in some regions stock a different microbrewery every month.

I'm just getting back into marathon training in my 40s, after taking half a decade off due to nagging injuries that I've finally found a good way to manage.  I typically run and lift fasted, mostly because I just don't feel hungry when I first wake up.  A cup of coffee is about all I need to clear the fog.

I went for my first longish run this past Saturday. And because I know I'll want to eat prior to my race, I decided to eat something light beforehand to get into the habit.. I had a slice of toast with a little peanut butter and honey on it.  I ate about 30 minutes before I started my run. 

The long run went well overall, but I felt like that food was just sitting in my stomach for the first hour or so, making the first couple times to do nutrition on the run not-so-fun since my stomach felt kind of full already. 

So what's the consensus, if any, on eating prior to your shorter runs?  I don't feel like I need it really, but I also worry just eating before the long runs won't allow my body to adjust to absorbing that fuel in a timely fashion.

So I was last weekend at a club. I got very dr*nk and somehow I met a girl there. Long story short we maked out and I brought her, after the club, home. Next day I met her again but sober. I was very embarrassed of me, bc I didn’t know anything about her. Her Name, Face etc, I forgot everything.
We went to a coffee date where I got to know her. She was nice but suddenly I dont really had the same energy. We talked a lot and she said that she’s not from here and heads tomorrow into another town. I felt bad, bc she was for a small vacation here and didnt really see anything here. So we spend the day together and I did some sightseeing with her through „my“ town at night. It was all fine but somehow I dont really felt that good with her. We went after that into a cocktail bar. With some cocktails we went together again into an club and after some beers with her it got spicy and we slept together. But even with this, I just didnt feel good with her yk? I think at the end she saw that I’m feeling not this good with that situation. After that she went into her hotel and till yesterday, after she left, no reaction between her and me. 
Now my question. Should I write her an goodbye message bc she leaves tomorrow? Was it just an ONS and I‘m just overthinking? 
What should I write in that message?

Can my story can uncover something about me?","I will try to keep it short. But I will not fill up everything. Maybe it's an interesting read, maybe not, I cannot promise anything. Maybe it would be all over the place and not chronological, but I will try to keep it neat. I apologize in advance if you feel confused. Maybe I will parse it through an LLM and I will correct it(looks like it feels really unoriginal after parsing through LLM, so I will keep the original format).

**Initial background**: I'm a 33 year old man. I've been delving into Jung for a few years now. My spiritual/esoteric journey began by watching Jiddu Krishnamurthi like 10+ years ago. I don't know how I started, but regardless of how it started, I'm glad that I took this journey because I come from a country(India) with no or little mental health support. I believe I suffer from a lot things, from anxiety, lack of courage, self doubt, depression, self sabotage, etc.

**Social Class**: I'm also from a low caste family which came from what look like dirt poor(from my father's side), where my father's parents owned a few pots, no toilet(they ran to the beach to do the toilet business), and they lived in a village, where most of the people there were involved in fishing, as it was our caste's task. In terms of hierarchy, we are lower, but in the past we were mercantile, but the British Raj(British Empire) and the socialist regime from 1947 to 1991 of independent India, the govt. didn't help in fishermen to start their own fishing business by financing it, and my dad had to go out of his village, and to another state to start working in fishing trawlers as they were well paid than just going on wooden rafts(you can google this name, *Kattumaram*, the infamous ""Catamaran"" traces it's origin to this Tamil word).

**Place where I was planted/bloomed(or not bloomed)**: Now having grown up in a different place from my dad's place of birth(where they spoke a different language, and slightly different culture), has made me an uprooted, rootless, cultureless person. I don't even know how to read or write my mother tongue Tamil. My parents were too busy with trying to food on table, my father in his fishing trawler, and later busy trying to transition his career which is more stable in a supply vessel(or tugboats), my mother was working as best as she could to take care of my brother and me(including doing all the chores because of the cultural aspect of not letting male child work and also being in a distant land away from hometown not in the midst of relatives). As opposed to the sandy beaches my father played in, and beaches he swam on. Or the village my mother grew up in. And oh, the only saving grace(or maybe a curse as well), I studied in an all boys school which is Christian/Catholic, which is quite rare in a non-Christian country. The only time I felt enamoured is studying in the old building built by Jesuit Priests. It felt like a sanctuary.

**Mother complex**: My mother being the only female child of her family. I believe my mother liked my younger brother more than me, because she thought she almost lost him in childbirth due to him suffering from epilepsy and diarrhea. I was born only a few years ago, so the difference between me and my brother is approx., 2 years, so I'd assume my parents took only 1 year break before attempting for my brother.

When I started to watch many of the spiritual videos, I felt a void of lacking the mother's love/distant, I felt no support for the first time I lived far away from my parents when I first left to study my Master program in a foreign land in my early 20s, which I later dropped out from due to the difficulty. At one point, I didn't want to talk to my mother constantly, I felt like it was a chore.

**Shadow/Issues at hand:** Due to my cultural background, I struggled with most tasks, like cleaning up, cooking food for myself, and if I have to be honest I looked like a hoarder, all the anxiety popped up all of a sudden. So unable to even function normally due to heavy sheltering. So pretty much dysfunctional, but it has improved a lot now. I'm more functional now, still not good enough.

* Lost in motivation to continue and heavy dysfunction and struggle in my early 20s, I went back home to India.
* Was super anxious about everything, and super obsessive personality about sciencey things.
* Was using porn as a cope throughout this time as a emotional hole filler. I believe I used to watch FTV to see slender western women wearing transparent clothing, this was in my probably 11-12 when I started this as my mother used to leave us to go to shop to get groceries from market. I also started to watch pornography in internet cafe when I was going once in a while and then when I got access to internet in my house, and also on phone, I used to watch as many time and masturbate to pornography, instead of going out socializing or doing a relaxing hobby or learning.
* After I dropped out, I went back home to India, was jobless for 5.5 years and I only was doing bare minimum(of just applying to jobs on job sites), doing self sabotaging things such as posting on 4chan, and imageboard, masturbating, not exercising etc. But I was trying to get on my foot, I tried to apply to go back to the same foreign country I was in for another Master degree, and luckily I got back. In the meanwhile, I was doing some studies which involved a field other than my own, I was not sure what I was doing, and also I bought Bitcoin and some cryptocurrencies, this was like midway in the time of my joblessness. Meanwhile my brother slogged his ass off and established his career, had to work in a really dirty job, beneath his qualification, but eventually got a great job. All the while with the emotional support of my mother. I felt distant from my mother, I couldn't communicate with my mother.
* I tried dating people online, during the pandemic, when I was stuck in this foreign country, I tried connecting with people on Reddit and tried to get in touch with women and understand their psyche, be befriending them and I have never once tried to be a creep, I was only pedestalizing them and that definitely creeped them off. I barely got to date. The only female friend I made during the pandemic is one of my classmates I accidentally met IRL when I decided to go on a walk while trying to do my internship. Recently, a few months ago, I finally was able to meet a long time chat friend from Reddit who also shared similar story, but she was kicked out of her uni in another country, and she came to the country I'm in to do her Master program. I'm not particularly attracted to her because she's BPD and not the most attractive. She's peculiar. But I still find her company decent while on chat, but not IRL. She has not been the same ever since she met me IRL. But my actual female friend from my IRL seems like the only genuinely interesting and nice person I have met and she happens to be a woman, I'm also not attracted to her physically, although initially I was interested in taking any woman, but she turned out to be dating only women at that time, she was dating a much older woman, like twice her age. I realized that even women have relationship problems and sex is not just the only thing in their lives.
* I'm taking more time than I need to graduate. Like 3x the time to graduate. It's not good. But I'm finally going to finish it. I'm currently doing my thesis.
* I constantly feel like I'm wearing a mask, I had at one point psycho eyes because I was wearing actual masks during pandemic and I rarely  used to go out so I had to look at others in piercing way due to my overconsumption of coffee and now I have stopped it, but I'm back on energy drink, which is fine because I'm not spiking my cortisol and being restless and anxious like when I was drinking coffee.

I posted recently that I am adding a second espresso machine to my existing Breville Oracle Touch which will go in a different location from the Oracle. I wanted to take the opportunity to upgrade from the Oracle to perhaps get better quality espresso and continue my coffee journey, and I have landed on the Profitec Move as a good option. I like the dual boiler (we drink milk drinks, and I'm a little spoiled already by the Oracle Touch in that regard).  Also like the look of the machine. I recently picked up the Df64v, and have been using it with the Oracle, and often the output volume varies greatly when I pull back to back shots. I'm wondering if I use the Df64v with the Move, will it yield better espresso drinks more consistently than the Oracle once I learn to use it. Does that sound like a nice ""upgrade"" path for me? Once the Oracle breaks (again, already broke once and we fixed it for like $400) we would probably go to something like the Bambino Plus, and eventually both machines will be in the same location down the road (just not for the next couple of years). Am I on the right track to consider the Profitec Move? BTW I'm not slamming the Oracle: I have used it daily since the 2020, and it only broke about a month ago. We got quite alot of use out of it.

PROMOTED

I do not want to be a spoiler but let me say in a few words: *With Love, Meghan* is part [*Secrets of the Blue Zones*](https://www.netflix.com/title/81214929) meets [*Finding Italy*](https://www.cnn.com/shows/stanley-tucci-searching-for-italy) with Stanley Tucci. It is a culinary, hospitality, and human connection masterclass. It was not at all what I was expecting, but I found myself caught up in the wonderful soundtrack and the freshness of each episode, where I learned how to do something not just new but, perhaps, something magical. Something peaceful. Something transformative when it comes to being a hostess in my home, in my garden, or simply with myself.

I love the first five minutes of the opening episode because Markle and a friend are standing with a beehive. Mining honey. Who knew that the Duchess was an apiculturist (a less common term for a beekeeper)? Both apiarist and apiculturist come from the Latin word *apis*, which means “bee.” Bees are such small yet powerful creatures, dating back to the time of the [dinosaurs](https://theconversation.com/did-bees-live-in-the-time-of-dinosaurs-125792). They make honey, which sustains us and heals us naturally. And yet, a simple sting from one of them can kill the biggest man or beast.

I believe she was being intentional with this opening around bees, signaling to us that she is not just okay—she is thriving.

With Love, Meghan. (L to R) Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Mindy Kaling in episode 102 of With Love, ... \[+\]

Netflix PR

As you move through each episode, you will notice something refreshing. The music ranges from a good mixture of instrumental R&B, new age, pop, and smooth jazz. And occasionally, a throwback to the 1950s bossa nova beat and 1960s Motown era. Hints of the Archies—""Sugar, aww honey, honey."" Frank Sinatra. A verbal shoutout by Markle to Beyonce’s song “Cozy.” And even a little ditty reminiscent of the Elvis era meets an Amy Whitehouse vibe. Great music. Great vibe.

Markle opens the series by talking about facing our fears and being connected. Being hospitable is one of my big things when people come to our home. So, I was thrilled to see how she spoils her guests with bedside gifts and refreshments. For my part, I have a bedside crystal water pitcher and glass set for guests, filled with fresh spring water in the morning and again at night.

In this series, viewers will learn how to make truffle popcorn from a literal ear of dry corn on the cob. This is a show for people who have time and love to cook, nurture, and connect with food, family, and friends.

Markle even threw in a great comment (while hanging with her bestie Daniel) about “sealing our edges”—Black women will laugh because it is a shout-out to her mixed race heritage as half white and half Black. Some will not catch when her friend Daniel says, “Lay it down, girl,”—talking about black women and how we take great care to have smooth hair edges. I laughed out loud. I caught it!!

In a nutshell, here are a **few takeaways** I can share without spoiling the series for you in advance:

1. **This show is not for everyone.** This show is for women (and some men) who have the time to be “present” and who entertain a lot. It is great for women who have children and, perhaps, houseguests often. It is for foodies and cooks. Bakers and homemakers. People who like home remedies, home cooking, and hospitality.

2. **This show opens us up to a different Meghan Markle.** She has grown wiser deeply since *the TIG* blog. And she is most of all at ease with herself. Something my late paternal grandmother used to tell me in my twenties: “One day you will get comfortable with yourself. And that is a great day in a woman’s life.” Meghan is 100% comfortable with herself.

3. **This is not a show you binge-watch.** You need to take it all in. It is a sensory treat, a delightful breath of fresh air when it comes to lifestyle shows. This series has it all: How to throw a good kid’s party. How to have “girls brunch in the garden.” And how to be present—the greatest gift of all the many I found in this series.

**My final recommendation**: Watch *With Love Meghan* with your girlfriends. With some great sangria or French press coffee. Take notes. Take it all in. Try some of the featured dishes and sweets. Try to make her famous Sun tea this summer. Just whatever you do watch it! You will thank me later.I was given a sneak peek at the new Netflix series “With Love Meghan” before the official Tuesday, March 4 release.

In January, I penned a column on [Forbes.com](http://Forbes.com) saying how much I was looking forward to Duchess Meghan Markle’s new Netflix lifestyle show, *With Love, Meghan*. More than that, [I shared five life lessons](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sophianelson/2025/01/04/meghan-markle-offers-life-lessons-in-success-resilience--grace/) I believe the Duchess, now in her early 40s, has taught us about the power of resilience, grace, and success.

Whether you are a fan or not, the objective truth is that Markle has lived through a[ very public “baptism by fire” ordeal ](https://www.newsweek.com/prince-harry-keeping-meghan-markle-away-britain-security-tabloids-1930515)and likely much more private tribulation with the Royal Family in the U.K. In 2020, she returned to the United States with her very own prince—the youngest son of the late Princess Diana and reigning British monarch King Charles III, Prince Harry. Also known as the Duke of Sussex.

So, you can imagine I was quite humbled by the opportunity to have an early preview of “With Love Meghan” at the request of Netflix. I watched the first five episodes of the show, which will air on Tuesday, March 4, 2025.

PROMOTED

I do not want to be a spoiler but let me say in a few words: *With Love, Meghan* is part [*Secrets of the Blue Zones*](https://www.netflix.com/title/81214929) meets [*Finding Italy*](https://www.cnn.com/shows/stanley-tucci-searching-for-italy) with Stanley Tucci. It is a culinary, hospitality, and human connection masterclass. It was not at all what I was expecting, but I found myself caught up in the wonderful soundtrack and the freshness of each episode, where I learned how to do something not just new but, perhaps, something magical. Something peaceful. Something transformative when it comes to being a hostess in my home, in my garden, or simply with myself.

I love the first five minutes of the opening episode because Markle and a friend are standing with a beehive. Mining honey. Who knew that the Duchess was an apiculturist (a less common term for a beekeeper)? Both apiarist and apiculturist come from the Latin word *apis*, which means “bee.” Bees are such small yet powerful creatures, dating back to the time of the [dinosaurs](https://theconversation.com/did-bees-live-in-the-time-of-dinosaurs-125792). They make honey, which sustains us and heals us naturally. And yet, a simple sting from one of them can kill the biggest man or beast.

1j2szlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/1j2szlb/pieper_bloomquist_a_north_dakotan_painter/,Pieper Bloomquist: A North Dakotan Painter Bringing Swedish Folk Art to the People,"To spend time with one of Pieper Bloomquist’s paintings is to be surprised and delighted.  
  
At first glance, you may think you’ve stumbled on a long-lost Nordic painting, full of muted egg tempera colors and folk-art figures. But looking closer, you’ll notice the figures are playing baseball, and the medieval script next to them is in modern English. It’s a moment that prompts a double take: What is going on here?  
  
Bloomquist, the North Dakota recipient of 2024 Midwest Culture Bearers Award, has dedicated her life to two traditional Swedish folk art painting practices, dalmålning and bonadsmålning. Along the way, she has found a way to blend these historic techniques with contemporary stories to create something all her own.  
  
After working as an oncology nurse for years, Bloomquist has spent much of her life listening to people’s stories and helping them through difficult times. Art became a way to manage stress and express her thoughts.

Her paintings show scenes like elders sipping coffee at a local Cenex, children climbing apple trees, or a North Dakota community rallying to move a church. Each piece bridges the past and present.

“I want the original paintings to be valued as tools that have allowed us to tell our stories,” Bloomquist explains. “But I’m very careful not to romanticize those old paintings. I recognize this tradition needs to stay relevant.”

I had diarrhea nonstop every hour for a week straight, lost weight and only after taking a round of antibiotics did I get better. 

Since then I’ve struggled with really messy and loose stools and leakage. I had some issues before the trip too, diarrhea a couple times a month, but mostly managed by eating habits and diet. Since being sick I haven’t had any diarrhea aside from self induced for a colonoscopy prep

In November I had a colonoscopy and diagnosed with ibs.  I’ve been struggling to get a handle of this. 

I’ve had some success since then, I’ve found that eating late at night will give me issues the next day, beer, and I’ve found that coffee can cause me more issues. Some rare days I have really good bowel movements, no mess. Others I don’t. 

Dairy doesn’t seem to cause me issues unless I eat too much in which case I just get backed up. My dr told me I don’t go enough, despite the fact that I go most days, but for me the main concern is the leakage. I find that part extremely stressful and I feel like me being sick must’ve damaged some nerves or something. It’s been like pulling teeth to get my dr to help with that.

Can you help me do the maths?

Let's take UK prices. Wholebean coffee is around £2.00 per 100g (e.g. Lavazza quality). Arabica coffee has around 1.5% of caffeine, so in a double (18g) there woule be 270mg of caffeine.

Nescafe Gold has around 25mg of caffeine per 1g of coffee granules. So to achieve a double level of caffeine I'd need 10.8g of instant coffee. Nescafe Gold costs around £7.00 per 200g, so £3.50 per 100g.

So one double of wholebean coffee would cost £0.36 whereas the equivalent double with instant would cost £0.38.

So instant more expensive than wholebean or am I doing the maths wrong?

The room smelled like sweat, blood, and stale coffee. Captain Vincent Voss sat slumped in the chair, his uniform a shredded mess of singed fabric, dried blood, and blackened stains from things he couldn’t begin to identify. His boots left muddy imprints on the tiled floor, and his gloves were still tacky with grime.

“You’re going to need to take a shower after this,” Major Lorne muttered, eyeing Voss with a mixture of disdain and something close to pity. He tapped the recorder in front of him, its red light blinking steadily.

Voss leaned back in the chair, ignoring the stiff ache in his shoulders. “I just walked out of hell. You can live with the smell.”

Lorne sighed, flipping open a folder filled with photographs and reports. “Fine. Let’s get this over with. Tell me everything, Captain. From the top.”

Voss’s jaw tightened, his eyes narrowing at Lorne. “Everything?”

“Everything,” Lorne repeated. “What did you see? What happened in that facility?”

Voss exhaled slowly, his voice low. “It started the moment we landed…”

The Landing

“The fog was so thick, you couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead,” Voss began, his voice low. “Our transport touched down a few klicks from the facility. It was quiet—too quiet. Just the hum of the engines and the crunch of gravel under our boots. The place looked ordinary at first glance, just another bunker buried in the middle of nowhere.”

He paused, dragging a hand across his grimy face. “But then we got closer, and we saw the doors. Twisted. Charred. Like something had forced its way out—or in. Whatever it was, it didn’t care much for subtlety.”

“What were you thinking at that point?” Lorne asked, his pen poised over the notepad.

“That we were in over our heads,” Voss admitted. “Command gave us next to nothing—just the usual orders: secure the site, neutralize the threats, and shut it all down. But seeing those doors… I knew this wasn’t going to be anything close to a standard op.”

---

Inside the Facility

“The air was… wrong,” Voss said, shaking his head slightly. “It felt heavy, like it was pressing down on you. Charged with static. Every step we took made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.”

“The facility was dark—pitch black. Flashlights barely did anything. Just pools of light in an ocean of shadows. It felt abandoned, like no one had been there for years. But it wasn’t. Bloodstains were smeared across the walls, some hand-shaped, others… dragged. Shattered glass crunched under our boots. Desks overturned, equipment smashed. Signs of a fight, a bad one. But there weren’t any bodies. Just… nothing.”

“And then you found it?” Lorne prompted.

Voss nodded. “Yeah. We turned a corner, and there it was—the Animus. Big. Alien. Like nothing we’d ever seen before. It didn’t belong in our world.”

“Describe it,” Lorne prompted.

“Crystalline conduits running all along its surface, glowing faintly. It was humming—not like a machine, but like something alive. And at the center of it all… the core. Pulsing. Waiting. It felt like it was watching us, even though it didn’t have eyes. Just… watching.”

---

First Contact

Voss leaned forward, his expression darkening. “We didn’t get long to admire it. Holloway spotted the first one—a Grimlock. It stepped into the light, and we froze. Used to be a miner, I think, judging by the tatters of its uniform. But it wasn’t human anymore.”

“What do you mean?” Lorne asked.

“Pale skin, stretched tight over its bones. No eyes—just empty sockets. But it moved like it could see us just fine. And fast. Faster than anything I’ve ever seen.”

Raines had been the first to react, raising his rifle with shaking hands. “What the hell is that thing?”

“Grim,” Holloway muttered, her shotgun already aimed. “Blind as a bat, but it doesn’t need eyes. It’s hunting us.”

“Grimlock,” Voss said at the time, the name slipping out instinctively. “That’s what we call it. Grimlock.”

“And then?” Lorne asked, pulling Voss back to the present.

“We opened fire,” Voss said bluntly. “It didn’t go down easy. Took a shotgun blast at point-blank range before it stopped moving. And then the others came. Not just Grimlocks. There were worse things—the scientists. The Nothics.”

Lorne’s pen stilled on the page. “The researchers?”

“They were coordinated,” Voss continued. “Intelligent. They used the shadows, split us up, drove us into corners. And the worst part? They were psionic. They got inside our heads. Made us see things—hear things. Memories, fears. Stuff we didn’t even know we still carried. It was like fighting ghosts.”

Holloway had named them during the chaos, her voice cold and sharp. “Nothics,” she spat, glancing at the grotesque, eye-riddled forms. “They don’t even look human anymore.”

The name stuck.

---

The Shutdown

Voss’s voice grew quieter, more measured. “When we reached the Animus chamber, we found Reed. Or what was left of her. She wasn’t… human anymore. Her body was twisted, her skin riddled with too many eyes. But she was still in there. She recognized us.”

He glanced down at his hands, his expression tightening. “She told us how to shut it down. We had to sever the conduits—cut the Animus off from its power source. But it wasn’t that simple. The machine fought back. Tendrils of energy lashed out, dark shadows moved like they had a mind of their own. It wasn’t just a machine. It was alive. And it didn’t want to die.”

“What happened to Reed?” Lorne asked, his voice softer now.

Voss hesitated, his jaw tightening. “When we severed the conduits, she screamed. Like it was ripping her apart from the inside. We thought it killed her, but… she survived. Barely.”

“And now?”

“She’s… connected to it,” Voss said, his voice heavy. “I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s like the Animus left a piece of itself in her. I don’t think she’ll ever be free of it.”

The room fell silent, the faint hum of the recorder the only sound. Lorne leaned back in his chair, tapping his pen against the folder. “The Animus is dormant now?”

“For now,” Voss replied. “But it’s not dead. It’s waiting.”

Lorne scribbled something on a notepad. “You understand the implications of this, don’t you? The Animus. Reed. The contamination. This isn’t just some rogue experiment. It’s… something more.”

Voss’s fists clenched, his voice hard. “I know what it is. And I know what it’s doing to the people out there. Grimlocks. Nothics. Entire towns gone. Are we just going to ignore that?”

“That’s not your concern anymore,” Lorne said coldly. “The Animus and Reed are classified. Command will handle them. Your job is done.”

Voss shot out of his chair, his eyes blazing. “Done? Do you have any idea what we just went through? What we saw? This isn’t over. Not by a long shot.”

Lorne stood, unfazed. “You’re dismissed, Captain. Get some rest. You’ll need it.”

As the door closed behind Lorne, Voss slumped back into his chair, his head in his hands. The images of the Animus, the monsters, and Reed’s broken form played on a loop in his mind.

Under his breath, he muttered, “This is so f***** up.”",1,1741034452.0,serialized_stories,0,1.0,False

As much as I try to pretend otherwise, I'm a spender. It recently took a huge step forward into losing most of my savings gambling. Even if I quit that, I still like to spend on impromptu shopping, ordering food, occasionally buying random crap I don't really need. I have a LOT of stuff I don't need, or even like anymore. 

It's like my subconscious knows this is bad; I feel intense guilt and shame when I compare myself to ""savers"" who haven't bought new clothes in 20y, never order in, never travel, only have ""free"" hobbies (or none at all), never go out, shop once or twice a year...and are (allegedly) happy this way. 

A big part of why I spend like I do is boredom. I don't make very much, or remotely enjoy what I do, so I rationalize that if I'm never going to have wealth, why not go out for a fancy coffee once a week or indulge my stationery collection? It's a dopamine burst, a break in monotony. ""That $10 could have been invested for retirement"" - I'm never going to retire, so who cares? 

At the same time, I don't like constantly losing the arguments with ""savers"" I have in my head, I still feel ashamed. I still believe I should at least be more of a saver, but I still can't entirely rationalize it. What's the benefit besides avoiding moral condemnation? ",0,1741034331.0,personalfinance,27,0.25,False

Starbucks espresso beans (sorry!) 2. Ceramic cup... WTF? 3. Tamp it good! 4. Less pre-infusion 5. Love the process. 6. Set up the night before

Just a couple weeks ago I had some doubt about my relationship with Robbie. I mean, I loved our time together but the espresso I was making, while better than my recently deceased Nespresso, was rarely great. Was it worth the fuss? The cost? I love bittersweet but was getting too powerful bitter and not much sweet. I felt as though my results had actually gotten worse over time. Then came a few discoveries.

STARBUCKS ESPRESSO ROAST BEANS

About 2 weeks ago I bought Starbucks Espresso beans to see how close to that familiar standard of espresso I could get. I have been a fan of Starbucks since around 1990 when I happened upon this cute little coffee shop across from my hotel in Chicago. (The windy city was their first foray outside the Pacific Northwest.) I was there in 1994 on the Upper West Side the morning the first of their now 2 million Manhattan locations opened. Probably at least 80% of the espresso shots I've had in my life - not counting Nespresso - have been in a Starbucks. So yeah, that's my standard.

So far those are, by far, the best beans I have tried. Granted they are the only true espresso roast beans I've tried yet so I'll try some others. Frankly, all the bags of medium and lighter roasts I've tried could go in the trash if I wasn't too cheap. So I slog through them here and there but to no avail. I'm a dark roast espresso guy. I just love that taste it leaves in your mouth, like you just had a nice piece of dark chocolate without calories and with a nice coffee buzz.

CERAMIC CUP

Here's an odd discovery. I realized that my results seemed to decline after I replaced my tried and true ceramic espresso cup with the fading peace sign (a sign of our times?) with a borosilicate glass espresso cup. I went back to the ceramic and instantly the taste noticeably improved. I did back-to-back shots one way then the other and, for me at least, it is confirmed. Ceramic just seems to smooth the edges and improve the taste. Anyone else find this?

TAMP IT GOOD. TAMP IT INTO SHAPE with apologies to Devo

I tamp HARD. First a stir with a WTD tool, shake it fairly flat, insert and turn the Cafelat tamper to smooth the top. Then press down with thumbs on opposite sides of one axis, then the other axis. I'm confident that gets it level without any fancy, shmancy tampy. I top it off with a paper filter - I found early on that helped the shot quality and ease of cleaning - plus the shower screen.

SHORT PRE-INFUSION

After adding water off the boil and getting Robbie's arms up and the portafilter in his belly, I press the arms down very lightly until I see the first drop or three then go for the press. I used to do a good 10-15 seconds of pre-infusion after first drops but found this made the shots too strong and too bitter.

ENJOY THE WHOLE PROCESS

I am typically an impressively lazy person. Hence my many years with Nespresso. I could be drinking a double shot within a minute or two of waking up or having a hankering. So I couldn't be more surprised how much I have come to enjoy the whole process of my new coffee routine. After all, drinking an espresso is only a minute give or take. The 8-10 minutes it takes to make/drink/clean up after is all part of and expands the experience. 

THE NIGHT BEFORE

One last important piece of the puzzle. I get that first morning shot set up the night before mainly to not wake my wife. Mad wife, bad life. I grind, prep, add the filters. Then I fill the open space above the shower screen with a small baggie and place the whole portafilter in a ziplock bag pressing most of the air out. My ceramic faded peace symbol cup is on the scale between Robbie's legs ready to go. When I get out of bed I click on the kettle first thing. I handle those those early morning got-tos and throw on some clothes. By that time all I've gotta do is take the portafilter out of the bag, pour water in it and let Robbie do his thing. Is the taste diminished? If so it's subtle. But the thought while getting out of bed that I'll be knocking back a shot in no time with no hassle is worth it.

NUMBERS

18g in 39-40 out. Usually 35-40 secs though I find the grind and tamp determines what the flow will be. Que sera, sera.

I have a question about a girl I met. To understand my problem I better describe it a little bit. 

So I was last weekend at a club. I got very dr*nk and somehow I met a girl there. Long story short we maked out and I brought her, after the club, home. Next day I met her again but sober. I was very embarrassed of me, bc I didn’t know anything about her. Her Name, Face etc, I forgot everything.
We went to a coffee date where I got to know her. She was nice but suddenly I dont really had the same energy. We talked a lot and she said that she’s not from here and heads tomorrow into another town. I felt bad, bc she was for a small vacation here and didnt really see anything here. So we spend the day together and I did some sightseeing with her through „my“ town at night. It was all fine but somehow I dont really felt that good with her. We went after that into a cocktail bar. With some cocktails we went together again into an club and after some beers with her it got spicy and we slept together. But even with this, I just didnt feel good with her yk? I think at the end she saw that I’m feeling not this good with that situation. After that she went into her hotel and till yesterday, after she left, no reaction between her and me. 
Now my question. Should I write her an goodbye message bc she leaves tomorrow? Was it just an ONS and I‘m just overthinking? 
What should I write in that message?

I’m going through a tough time and I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar. I’m currently studying Nursing at university, but honestly, I’m not sure if it’s what I really want. I chose this degree mostly because of family pressure and because it seemed to have good job prospects, but I’m feeling more and more disconnected from it.

The problem is that I’m not only unsure about my future — my parents also don’t trust me. I failed 5 out of 6 subjects in the first semester, so this semester, I decided not to study Epidemiology in order to focus on passing the other 4 subjects and saving my scholarship. Even though I’m trying to turn things around, I feel like my parents only see my failures and not the effort I’m making.

The other day, after an exam, I mentioned that I thought I might get a 4 out of 10 (I had coffee before the test and it made me feel awful — I was shaking, had a headache...), and that’s when my parents told me that if I plan to leave Nursing next year, they won’t let me switch to another degree because they see me as indecisive and think I’m not capable of completing any degree.

I know I’m lost — I admit that — and it frustrates me because I don’t know what path to take, but it also hurts that they won’t give me the space to figure out what I really want to do.

Has anyone else been through something like this? How do you deal with doubts about your future when it feels like neither you nor the people around you believe in you?

Let's take UK prices. Wholebean coffee is around £2.00 per 100g (e.g. Lavazza quality). Arabica coffee has around 1.5% of caffeine, so in a double (18g) there woule be 270mg of caffeine.

Nescafe Gold has around 25mg of caffeine per 1g of coffee granules. So to achieve a double level of caffeine I'd need 10.8g of instant coffee. Nescafe Gold costs around £7.00 per 200g, so £3.50 per 100g.

So one double of wholebean coffee would cost £0.36 whereas the equivalent double with instant would cost £0.38.

So instant more expensive than wholebean or am I doing the maths wrong?

I've seen enough posts about ""GTA VI MUST HAVE REALISTIC GORE"" so I got tired of explaining why GTA VI will most likely not feature gore, not even on RDR 2 level. If you see another of these posts, please direct OP to this post so they might understand why gore is not possible in GTA.

https://preview.redd.it/yg5ldiua8jme1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e122934550f732a3d0af36d3297b824b4dc1e58

The Grand Theft Auto franchise has always been at the center of controversy due to its themes of crime, violence, and moral ambiguity. However, while past entries have pushed boundaries, i**t is highly unlikely that GTA VI will feature extreme gore**. The primary reason for this is that excessive violence in a modern-day setting would expose Rockstar Games to unprecedented levels of scrutiny, potentially leading to bans in multiple regions.

**The Game Is Already Under Intense Scrutiny:** GTA VI is perhaps the most highly anticipated video game of all time, but it is also launching into an era where media and political scrutiny of violent entertainment is at an all-time high. The game is already perceived negatively by many policymakers and advocacy groups. If it were to include hyper-realistic gore mechanics—such as full dismemberment, detailed wound simulation, and excessive blood effects—Rockstar would be providing critics with the perfect justification to advocate for restrictions or outright bans.

https://preview.redd.it/72y4d3lbbjme1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=20f6901eb082df2d52cad84bc54bca3bd8021619

The GTA franchise has faced bans and censorship in multiple countries over the years:

* **Brazil**: GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas were all banned due to their violent content and depiction of criminal activities. San Andreas was particularly controversial due to the ""Hot Coffee"" mod, leading to its prohibition.
* **Australia**: Several GTA games, including GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas, were either banned or heavily censored. San Andreas was pulled from shelves due to the ""Hot Coffee"" controversy before being re-released with an MA15+ rating.
* **Germany**: The country has strict video game laws, and GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas were all indexed by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons (BPjM), restricting their sale and advertisement.
* **China**: The entire GTA series is effectively banned in China due to strict censorship laws regarding crime and violence in media.
* **Thailand**: After a tragic incident where a teenager mimicked a crime from GTA IV, the game was banned outright.
* **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**: GTA IV and GTA V were both banned due to explicit content and violence.
* **Saudi Arabia**: Multiple GTA games have been banned due to religious and moral concerns.
* **South Korea**: GTA III and GTA IV faced distribution issues due to age restrictions and concerns over violent content.
* **United States**: While not officially banned, GTA V faced significant backlash due to petitions related to depictions of violence against women. The game has also been the subject of various legal battles and congressional hearings.

**“The Game Won’t Be Banned”:** A common counterargument is that GTA VI, being such a massive release, will not face significant restrictions. However, history contradicts this belief. Every major GTA release has been banned or censored in multiple countries, including Australia, Germany, and Brazil. Even GTA V faced attempts at banning in the United States due to its depiction of violence against women. With the current political climate, a game that allows players to commit ultra-violent acts in a hyper-realistic, modern-day Miami setting would undoubtedly attract far greater opposition than previous entries.

**Context Matters:** Some may argue that Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) featured a high level of brutality without facing significant bans. However, the historical context of the Old West fundamentally alters the perception of violence. The game’s setting in the late 19th century, a period known for lawlessness, makes its depiction of violence appear more contextualized rather than gratuitous.

Similarly, The Last of Us Part II (TLOU2) included extreme gore mechanics, yet the game did not face major bans. This is because TLOU2 is a linear, story-driven experience that portrays violence as a tragic and emotional consequence of survival. GTA, on the other hand, is an open-world sandbox that gives players the freedom to engage in violence for entertainment purposes. This distinction is crucial: a post-apocalyptic survival story justifies gore in a way that an open-world crime game set in a modern city simply cannot.

1. **The Political and Legal Risks Are Too High** GTA V came dangerously close to being banned in the United States. With increasing concerns about media influence on real-world violence, a new GTA installment featuring extreme gore would provide politicians with a direct opportunity to push for new restrictions. The gaming industry is already under significant legal pressure, and GTA VI’s immense popularity means it will inevitably be a major target for regulation. According to scholars such as Ferguson and Kilburn (2009), while no definitive link between video game violence and real-world aggression has been established, the perception of such a connection continues to fuel political discourse and regulatory efforts.
2. **Financial Risk:** The $2 Billion Investment It is reported that Rockstar Games has invested approximately $2 billion into the development of GTA VI. Given the immense financial stakes, the company is unlikely to take excessive risks that could jeopardize the game’s availability in key markets. This game is not just another title—it is meant to be the defining open-world experience of the decade. If Rockstar includes elements that increase the likelihood of bans or heavy censorship, they risk alienating investors, reducing sales, and damaging the long-term profitability of the franchise. According to industry analysts, the success of GTA VI depends on its accessibility across global markets, making censorship concerns a key factor in development decisions (Tassi, 2023).
3. **Why Avoiding Extreme Gore Is Better for the Series** Beyond financial and political concerns, Rockstar has a creative incentive to steer away from ultra-realistic gore. Over-the-top violence might initially appeal to some players, but it would also increase the likelihood of bans, which would severely limit the game’s reach. GTA thrives on player freedom, satire, and immersive world-building—none of which require extreme gore to be effective. Rockstar is likely to prioritize a balance between violence and accessibility to ensure the game reaches as many players as possible without unnecessary controversy.

I understand that this might disappoint some 14-year-olds eager for gratuitous violence, but the reality is that GTA’s success depends on its ability to remain widely available. Rockstar is crafting an experience that will define open-world gaming for years, and sacrificing that for unnecessary gore would be a short-sighted decision.

GTA VI will undoubtedly feature violence, but Rockstar will likely avoid extreme gore to mitigate controversy and ensure the game remains accessible worldwide. The combination of intense media scrutiny, historical bans, contextual differences with other violent games, and significant financial risk makes it highly improbable that GTA VI will push the boundaries of gore to an extreme level. Instead, Rockstar will focus on delivering a refined, immersive experience without crossing a line that could threaten the game’s success.",0,1741033791.0,GTA6,25,0.27,False

I was drinking about 6 espressos a day, but despite all that caffeine, I was frequently feeling tired and wanted to stop being dependent on it.

Surprisingly, I didn’t experience any major withdrawal symptoms aside from having trouble falling asleep during the first week. No headaches, no feeling (even) more tired.

However, as the weeks went on, I started noticing some unexpected other effects:

* My ability to focus on my work dropped significantly.
* My anxiety increased a lot.
* I felt hyperactive, constantly overthinking negative stuff, which only made the anxiety worse.

About a week ago, after having drunk zero coffee for 2 months, I decided to treat myself to a cappuccino on my way to work - and it was a night and day difference. It gave me an extremely calming effect: my mind felt quiet and so at peace that I almost wanted to doze off. Once I got to work, I found it super easy to focus and get things done. It legitimately felt like a kind of ""high"" where I was just happy to work and stay in the zone. I even find that I start talking at a lower pace and have more patience in general.

As the caffeine wore off later in the day, I became restless again - checking my phone, seeking distractions, etc.

Since then, I’ve started drinking coffee again, sometimes using caffeine pills to compare and they both have the same effect: caffeine makes me feel noticeably more relaxed rather than jittery or energetic. I tried to set a rule for myself to abstain from coffee on the weekends to try to avoid building a tolerance, but I had to abandon that idea because I simply could not unwind without it.

When I was off coffee, I genuinely felt like I was losing the ability to do my job due to the lack of focus. Now, with caffeine back in my system, I can think clearly and work confidently again.

A little backround: 
Me (22M) and my gf (18F) haven't been together for a very long time, just over 4 months to be exact. We met through out shared hobby volunteer firefighting.
It's been going really well for the last months. I was regulary employed, she works full-time too and we built a very comforting and great relationship with one another. 
It got to the point where we saw each other daily, I spend a lot of time at her place and with her family and spend most nights too.

This year marked a big change in my life as I joined the military and it changed many things in my life:

I would be away for the whole week, only being home 2 days on the weekend.

We keep in contact through videocalls and texts and then spend most of the weekend with one another.

Recently she noticed a change in me and it effected her and our relationship. I started being absolutely negative and de-motivated about just anything.
I've always had a more negative way of thinking, mostly seeing my problems and not my successes and she noticed it from the start too. But now it's gotten to the point where it changes the way the feels about me.

I'm very focused on her and can see for myself that I value her way higher than my personal needs and the only thing I want to do when I get home is to spend time with her and only her. Yet I kept seeing everything in such a negative way and started complaining about the littlest things that she is starting to get dragged down with me. She noticed she is quite satisfied with herself during the week and is feeling well but the last few weekends she is feeling down and not happy as I am always around telling her how bad everything is.

A few examples:

She was sick one weekend and we spend all the time in bed together, watching Netflix and she wanted to mostly sleep. I dont like to come back from a week of service to just lay around the whole weekend instead of going out and seeing something diffrent in my hometown. Even though I could've left at any moment during my stay to do my own thing I wanted none of it at that time and wanted to rather stay with her, secretly being annoyed she couldn't spend the time with me how I pictured it. Which I now realise sounds insane.

The week after that she was well again and I was thrilled to be spending all of it with her without anything to hold us back. I forgot however that she was dogsitting for someone from our fire department that I don't like. The pure presense of the dog annoyed me in a way that I spend the whole weekend just nagging away at everything I could and blaming the dog that we couldnt spend quality time together, even though we absoluty could've just taken the dig with us.

Last weekend I was already home mid-week and everything was fine. We spend the evening I came back on together. She had to work the next day. I picked her up from work and we went to my grandparents for some coffee. She had to work the next day and as a few friends wanted to grab a beer I went to a local pub and slept at home that night. On friday we went shopping. I was looking for a particular item and as I couldnt find it in 2 seperate shops I got fed up with the whole day and had no motivation for anything else. Even though we could've had a nice shopping day were I just didnt get what I wanted but still had fun, I was just annoyed for tge rest of the day and let that out on her. Throwing faces and getting annoyed when she wanted to look for something herself even though I dragged ger through half the city just for myself before. At night she wanted to decorate the house with her sister as her mothers birthday was the next day and I got extremely annoyed how she didnt want to lay in bed with me instead because we had an exhausting day. Getting mad for her taking 2 hours to finish everything, completely overlooking the whole situation.

I could go on but those were the main issues in the last few weeks. We went to a party on saturday and it really made everything worse. I got way too drunk, trying to always have her attention on me, dragging her from conversations, getting her mother mad at me for being annoying and even trying to pick a fight with the owner of the dog who ask me why I looked so upset when he picked the dog up.

Okay wow, now that I typed all this down and tried to keep it as compact as possible, I realise I might have more issues than I knew of. It sounds insane. My main points for this post however where:

-Seeing everything negativly

-Having a whole day ruined by a single action, then acting like a child about it

-Having my girlfriend as the center of my life and having my life completely revolve around being with her all the time

She told me she noticed all of this, noticed that this is a rather new behavior and it is effecting her negativly. She wants to stay with me but only when I work on getting better and not negativly influencing her quality of life.

We talked a lot about this and a few things I want to start improving on:
-Focus more on myself and my hobbies, spend some time apart from each other
-Try to see the positive whole picture and not the single negative actions
-Be less controlling and jealous

I dont really know if this is enough for someone to at least give me a hint or if someone had a similar experience but I want to start somewhere. I havent noticed this before but it is effecting the person I hold closest to my heart and my own quality of life.

I often dont notice these actions while I do it, I notice what happend only afterwards or when I am confronted by it. Its honestly a bit scary. I want to be better and dont drag people around me or myself down because of my issues. The last thing I want is for this relationship to fail, I have never been so happy before in my life, before meeting this awsome person.

Price will be $2600

Okay, I've taken more pictures from the storage unit of his box of iPods and a second box of (mostly Belkin) accessories. iPods are still in original shrink!

To make this as painless as possible for me, I am sticking to those that have a reasonable post history IN THIS (or similar) iPOD FORUMS. This way they go to someone that will appreciate them.

Separating, packaging, and mailing it all is more than I can take on right now, for reasons that will be readily apparent should we meet. For this reason, the purchaser will have to meet me at the storage locker in Pacifica to pick up. I don't have Venmo or Stripe or Apple Pay. I would ordinarily accept crypto but I'm stuck in a verification loop with my Coinbase, so will have to ask for cash in newer bills (that can be UV verified as a measure of protection for me against counterfeits).

Along those lines, I understand there are Chinese counterfeits. I can only assure you that these were purchased by my meticulous father (commercial and military pilot) at Costco at the times they were on sale there. No, I don't have receipts, but I can show you enough other random unopened Costco packages tp convince you, LOL.

Meeting details can be arranged in any way that makes you feel comfortable, but there's really nothing to worry about. We can meet at a local coffee shop where everyone knows me.

Looking for an immediate sale at $2600 for the iPods, cases, battery (adapter?) package deal, accessories, and all.

DM only if you have cash in hand and are able to meet in Pacifica today or tomorrow before dark.

I wanted to ask here something friendship related. I went to med school for a while but I have quit for a different profession. In med school I met my best friend. We still live in the same city and I see her regularly but I noticed that she is becoming more and more critical of me. For example, when we went shopping for a jeans for myself, the jeans would almost fit but then she said yeah but the issue is your booty that the jeans do not fit well. I was like, ok, thats your opinion, but it felt somehow weird she would point out a particular body part of mine. So a few weeks later I told her that I still have not found a pair of jeans and then she said well your booty is just too fat. It came across as very dismissive towards me and insensitive. Now I am doubting my body and that my booty is maybe really too fat. 

Yesterday we went studying together and when I accidentally dropped my lit from my coffee cup she said something like yeah, good that you are not studying medicine anymore, really good you are not studying it anymore, you would probably be the type of doctor where I would use a gadget wrong and then the whole blood is spreading through the room. I was kind of really sad she would say something like that. She makes it oftentimes really clear how great it is to study medicine and that she will have no issue finding a job after her studies and that she is super confident she can do this all but at the same time she puts me down for my decisions instead of being interested in it... I am currently studying something law related and then today she said like yeah but law students only have to study paragraphs by heart, so again something where I felt like she needs to feel better that studying medicine is better. 

It really starts to frustrate me that she looks down on me, like even when I talk to her she sometimes has this condescending way of looking at me when I say something, like almost I am not being taken seriously by her, its hard to explain.

Before I confront her, I just wanted to ask you guys if you think that something is wrong here in this friendship or if I am just being too sensitive? Every time I a around her I feel like some sort of failure if that makes sense or that something is not quite right with me. Thank you!

**Monaco:** Emilie De Rochefort(Sorry Asuka’s fans, but Lili is going to be in this tournament instead of her. But hey, think of this as a semi break between those two as Lili tries to prove that she is not just some rich girl, but a credible fighter).



**France** Victor Chevalier (Since Raven and Master Raven can’t get shit done, the Phantom Raven has to do it himself with refined violence)



**Poland:** Lidia Sobieska(The Prime Minister of Poland has unfinished business. For the pride of her homeland and her family’s legacy! Osu!)  



**Sweden:** Lars Alexandersson(The only other “Mishima” aside from Kazuya in the tournament. Only this time Lars is going to embrace his Swedish heritage)



**Russia:** Sergei Dragunov(Would you rather have the waifu robot with chainsaws or The White Angel of Death that virtually has no weakness? Either way, you’re fucked. At least Dragunov is a better rep for Russia unlike Alisa who can't even speak Russian). 



**Brazil:** Eddy Gordo(Unlike the other Brazilians like Christie and Katarina, Eddy is a legacy character and honestly I'm loving his redemption arc in this game. He feels fresh/new compared to the other legacy characters iMO)



**Thailand:** Fahkumran(Probably the most popular Tekken 7 newcomer in this subreddit next to Claudio is back. No one will withstand the wrath of this deadly Muay Thai fighter)  
  
  
**Philippines:** Josie Rizal (Wait, two Muay Thai fighters in one tournament and none of them is Bruce? Sorry Bruce fans, but your boy is going to have to wait for the next tournament. Hopefully this time Josie represents the Philippines a little better than last time.)



**Peru:** Azucena Ortiz(Oh you thought that you could escape the Coffee Queen? Think again buckos. Only this time she is going to be more obnoxious in the worldwide stage) 



**South Korea:** Baek Doo San(I decided to change things up and bring back Baek instead of Hwoarang. Think of Hwoarang deciding to not be in the tournament because Jin is not there. Anyway, Baek is back and ready to prove that he still got it. Step aside young fella)



**Spain:** Miguel Caballero Rojo(Rejoice because the Spanish Bull is back! I mean sure, he can’t get his revenge on Jin since he’s not in the tournament but hey Kazuya is the next best thing. Every Mishima will die by his hands…yes even Lars who has nothing to do with his sister’s death).   
  


**Italy:** Claudio Serafino(The Sirius Exorcist has a mission. To eradicate Kazuya forever. Winning the tournament while repping Italy is just an extra bonus for him.)



**China:** Feng Wui(I picked Feng instead of Ling, Lei, and Lee because he doesn’t have “L” in his name. Okay all kidding aside, IMO Feng has the most to prove while entering the tournament. If he truly wants to be the best in the world, he has to prove it by winning the tournament while defeating the heavy hitters like Paul, Kazuya, etc)



**Egypt:** Zafina(Zafina needs to cut the bullshit and just tell us that she is from Egypt already. She is lowkey one of the reasons why Shaheen is in the game due to her ambiguity pissing off the Middle Eastern community. Embrace your heritage Zafina while you still have Azrael by your side….. before Kazuya takes it away from you but i digress)



**Saudi Arabia:** Shaheen(Yes, the so called most boring character in the franchise is in the tournament. Only this time he has the country of Saudi Arabia supporting him to the fullest so he is no longer just fighting for his fallen friend. I’ll leave it up to you guys to debate whether that makes him more interesting or not)



**Ireland:** Anna Williams(I love Nina but she needs a break. It’s time for her little sister to get the spotlight. The events of Tekken 7 rekindled her flame and she's out to prove that she is indeed better than her sister)



**Germany:** Niklas Kliesen(I’m not a huge fan of Leo to be honest and Daddy Kliesen seems much more interesting. He is also a Bali Quan practitioner, so let’s see what he can do in the King of Iron Fist Tournament. In addition, since my girl Reina is not in the tournament, we need another newcomer to replace her).   
  


**United Kingdom:** Steve Fox(He is done playing around! The world's greatest boxer is in the tournament to finally seek revenge against Kazuya. No more distractions for him) 



**Mexico:** King(I’m going to be honest. I wanted to replace King with Armor King, but apparently his country of origin is unknown. Which makes sense since Armor King is based on Black Tiger and Black Tiger never represented a country since wrestlers from different backgrounds played that role. Anyway, King is in the tournament instead. Maybe this time it’s a completely different King from the past two iterations.)



Hopefully I haven't forgotten any country. This took me awhile so I'd appreciate any feedback. Also writing this made me realize that perhaps he need a little more country's representation. Only 22 countries is represented in Tekken. Still not a bad number for a Tekken game

1j2s5tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1j2s5tv/fragile_male_customer/,Fragile Male Customer,"This isn’t so much of a rant, as an irritating customer story that I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. 

Years ago I managed the satellite location of a local coffee chain that was on a corporate campus. This was awesome in a lot of ways, one of which being we basically had a closed customer base, so we got to know our customers really well. 

Most of our customers were wonderful. They were kind, understanding, and genuinely seemed to respect us and our craft (which is unfortunately rare in this industry). Then there was Mr. Pink. I don’t actually know what his real name was. None of us did. It didn’t matter, though. We wouldn’t have used his real name anyway. 

Some information: in addition to the usual coffee and tea drinks we also made smoothies, and would give customers a bubble straw to go with them. We used the colourful straws, and some people would request a specific colour. I get it. I have no problem with that. 

Anyway, back to Mr. Pink. He came in to the shop one day and I assumed he was a new hire since I had never seen him before. I was talking to him; just asking him getting to know you questions and making his smoothie. I went to hand him his drink and I grabbed a random bubble straw. I didn’t pay attention to what colour I grabbed since he didn’t ask for anything specific, so I handed his drink out with a pink straw. He looked me right in my eyes, and with his human person mouth said to my face, “I don’t mean to be a girl about this but can I have a not pink straw.”

I just blinked. My brain stopped working. I had just been insulted by this stranger in like three different ways, all over the colour of a straw. 

After a few seconds my brain booted back up, I took the pink straw back and gave him a different one. Then I pointed to his strawberry banana smoothie and said, “you know that smoothie is pink, right? You gonna be okay?” He just took his drink and walked away. 

Unfortunately he became somewhat of a regular. But every time he came in we would give him a pink straw. He would always ask for a different one. ",9,1741032763.0,barista,10,0.72,False
