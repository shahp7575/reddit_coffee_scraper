1kez8mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4rAsexual/comments/1kez8mx/34_m4f_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,34 M4F - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* Due to my personality and desires, I could be considered part of the ace/aro spectrum. **I'm a lifelong demisexual who's becoming more demiromantic with age. In a digital/online context, I'm much more graysexual** due to it not requiring actual physical touch. I get along very well with people across this spectrum despite having sexual desires myself. If nothing else, we can have amazing conversations.
* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

I have a Gaggia classic Evo Pro and  a Lelit Mara X V2 . I got the Lelit as an  end game machine upgrade to my Gaggia and I have been enjoying it but I have had a bit of trouble getting it dialed in with a couple of my lighter roasts that I really like. Well I hadn't used the Gaggia since I got the Lelit and had cleaned it and put it away , Was trying to sell it locally but hadn't really had any luck with it, But i decided to get it out the other day because I felt like it was a waste of it just sitting in storage and I've pulled a couple of shots on it with the same beans and the same grind setting that I've been using on my Lelit .. They were phenomonal . Well balanced with a thick body . At a 1 to 2 ratio .. To get anything that approaches well balanced with the Lelit I have to almost pull a 1 to 3 with these beans. So I have a couple of theroies about why the Gaggia is pulling better shots but wanted to see what ya'll think . Theroy one is that the gaggia doesn't have pre infusion , I have always heard that pre infusion makes your coffee better but it's definitely better on the Gaggia than the Lelit so maybe the pre infusion is producing less quality shots. Theory 2. The Gaggia seems to be almost boiling hot when the water starts to come out of the group head and maybe the higher temp is giving me a better shot. I have the marax set to brew mode but with the highest temp setting on the PID switch . Thought?

1kez2jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1kez2jm/my_26f_hs_classmate_23m_came_to_my_birthday_party/,My (26F) HS classmate (23M) came to my birthday party and it blew up in my face,"2 weeks after our blowup, Sheldon (23M) texted me (26F) to have a sit-down. He relented, saying that he shouldn’t have minimized my efforts to see his POV and the fact that I even watched those movies should have been acknowledged as a good faith effort. I agreed to make a more conscious effort to participate in Sheldon’s activities, but still recognize when it’s not my cup of tea and bow out. With that said, my co-workers were throwing a birthday party for me next month. Nothing fancy, just a bunch of my friends at my favorite bar: singing karaoke and drinking the night away. Something I assumed Sheldon would not be interested in,…

The following week, I picked up Sheldon to go to the local mall to get his trading card pre-order and have lunch at a new Thai place. During lunch, I ran into a few friends who were on their way out. One of them said: *“Can’t wait for the 1st!”* Sheldon asked what was going on on that day, and I absent-mindedly mentioned the party.

*Sheldon: “That sounds like a blast, I’d love to come.”*

I stopped mid-sentence. He was not kidding. At a loss for words, I just stuttered: *“Are,… Are you sure? This isn’t something we’ve done before.”* Sheldon said eagerly: *“I said I’d like to go.”*

This should come as no surprise, but Sheldon avoids most gatherings (save for study groups, labs, and D&D sessions) because he is a bit of a germaphobe. The fact he allows me to hug him is pretty huge. He also avoids places with loud music/noises, so he doesn’t go to concerts, sporting events, bars, or clubs - hence my surprise that he’d be eager to my birthday party knowing where it was going to be.

I’ve never questioned Sheldon’s resolve to do anything he sets his mind to, but now he will be in my element. I thought to myself, OK I’m going to mentally prepare him for what to expect. Among a smattering of other tidbits including my friends/co-workers (roughly 20 people were coming), I made sure to let him know about the bar itself (menu items, tipping the KJ, tabletop games, noise levels, etc.)

The night of my birthday party, I introduced Sheldon to as many friends and co-workers as I could but as the night went on, I had quite a few drinks and admit I didn’t check in on him as much. A couple hours later, he tapped me on the shoulder to tell me he was leaving. I reached over to hug him and say goodnight, but he pulled away and quickly walked out the door. I don’t remember much about that night, but I do remember that.

I awoke the next morning to a barrage of texts, all from Sheldon. I was still quite groggy, so I didn’t want to read any of them until my head stopped pounding. I heard my phone ring but I ignored it and went back to sleep. About an hour later, Sheldon was knocking at my door. I opened up and he stormed in: *“I want to talk about last night!”* As I was still nursing my hangover, I asked if we could talk later. Sheldon was clearly fuming from the minute he left the bar, so he was insistent we have a sit-down right there and then. Before I could get the coffee brewing, he pulled out a sheet of paper and began listing his complaints in chronological order:

1. I deliberately chose not to drive or offer him a ride\*
2. I didn’t explicitly introduce him as “my friend”
3. The cups and utensils weren’t properly cleaned
4. The KJ dissed him+
5. He felt ignored because we (friends/co-workers and I) didn’t engage in conversation with him

*\* Normally I would be the one to drive Sheldon but as I planned on drinking that night, I planned to Uber to the bar and have a friend take me home. I did make sure to let Sheldon know ahead of time so he could plan his route.*

*+ Apparently the KJ didn’t have the song he requested. KJ may have laughed at him, hence the diss.*

Not knowing where to begin, I started by addressing the complaints I had no control over, such as the bar:

*Me: “I’m not sure what you’d like me do about the cutlery and the KJ.”*

*Sheldon: “Well, I’d appreciate it if we never went there again.”*

*Me: “Yeah, I can’t force the group to boycott the bar. So I’ll just say that if we have another party there, you’re under no obligation to attend.”*

*Sheldon: “Fine. Now let’s discuss how you ignored me. You know I didn’t know anyone there.”*

*Me: “There were people I hadn’t seen in a long time that I wanted to catch up with.”*

*Sheldon: “Oh that’s right, cuz you’re sooooo popular and I’m not as important as your other friends. I make so many accommodations for you, and you can’t do one thing and make sure I’m ok?”*

*Me: “First of all, it’s not just ONE thing if you made a list. Secondly, are you serious? I shouldn’t have to baby-sit to someone at my own birthday party!”*

*Sheldon: “Pffft, I can see why FWB didn’t want to stick around.”*

That was the last straw. I confided in Sheldon about my FWB, my ectopic pregnancy and my surgery after I was fully recovered. He admitted he didn’t fully understand it, but he was sympathetic. I never thought in a million years he would hold that against me. I was pissed and I let him know it.

*Me: “You say you make accommodations for me, but you don’t use that to guilt-trip people. Also, friends don’t bring issues or complaints to each other in an attempt to fix or humiliate them. We accept friends as they are or don’t. Oh that’s right - you don’t understand because you don’t have friends!”*

Sheldon was shell-shocked to say the least. Without a word, he grabbed his jacket and slammed the door behind him. I do feel bad that I took a cheap shot about his lack of friends, but he had no right to weaponize personal information that was disclosed to him in confidence. Did I overreact?

*TL;DR - HS classmate catches wind of my b-day party and asks to attend. Gets mad I didn’t check in him while at my party. Comes to my place demanding a sit-down despite my hang-over. Makes rude comment about former FWB and I snapped at him.*",1,1746405941.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

I have V60 kits at home with a good grinder but never ever my coffee smell and taste like this. I followed the Kasuya methos almost all the time btw but never achieve this kind of results.

1keyzfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cedarpoint/comments/1keyzfr/opening_weekend_thoughts/,Opening weekend thoughts.,"So opening weekend was a mixed bag for sure. The park seemed to be doing their damnest to get anything up and running that they could. The rides that did open had pretty good ops, especially for opening day. The weather played such a huge part in screwing up stuff. Coasters generally don't like cold, wet, and windy conditions. However hats off to the park for making solid attempts to open rides and keep people happy. (Just saw that Millennium Force valleyed due to the cold and wind, that really sucks, but it shows the park was trying but the weather was winning a lot of battles.)

Food lines were longer on Saturday, but they did move pretty good. Food lines were pretty short Sunday and service was quick. Quality wise it was all about the same as last year, but some things were just a bit different. Hell, the steak option at Grand Pavilion was different from Saturday to Sunday, but thats probably just early season stuff. 

I know a lot of people were pissed that TT2 didn't open Sunday, but the park was running train after train after train and while they were making it over the top hat, they weren't consistent. Some would go over fine, others barely made it. I'm sure there is some sort of criteria that they weren't meeting in order to open the ride. Plus judging by what happened Saturday if they would have loaded a train in these conditions it wouldn't have made it over. Yes it sucks, especially for the people who waited for a few hours in the hope it would open (myself included), but it is what it is. That is the risk for waiting for a ride in these conditions. Those people who decided to yell at the ride ops who announced that it wouldn't open, you should be ashamed of yourselves. They don't make that call, and they're just relaying the message.

A few positive things... the premium drink plan that included coffee and hot cocoa came in clutch this weekend for sure. Fresh warm beginets from French Quarter hit the spot when you're chilly. Also Sirens Curse looks nuts in person, can't wait to ride it!",2,1746405675.0,cedarpoint,0,0.75,False

1keyypr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1keyypr/its_been_a_month_since_i_last_spoke_to_her_was/,It's been a month since I last spoke to her. Was she toxic?,"Starting from the beginning...

I'm 20 years old, and a few months ago, I started seeing a 23-year-old woman. I'll call her L.

We had a very strong connection right away, but things have been really difficult between us.

From the beginning, it was already hard to go out with L (it took about 2–3 attempts before we managed to meet up), and even after we did, things didn’t get easier.

L has borderline personality disorder, trauma from her ex-boyfriends, and from the start, she said she didn’t want a relationship.

The problem is, even though she acted that way, she also showed signs of wanting something serious, like being romantic, giving gifts to me and my family, wanting me to go out with her and her family, and—believe it or not—getting jealous.

Anyway, despite the good moments we had, these past months were also full of ups and downs, with her wanting distance during her crises and me always being patient, trying to talk to her and make her feel better.

It went on like that until mid-November, when we broke up for good. She said we should just be friends and that we wouldn’t be hooking up anymore.

At that time, I randomly met a girl on Instagram (I'll call her N). N ended up helping me during that period. She supported me through the breakup and even gave me advice about the situation.

N invited me to go out about three times, but I declined all of them because of L.

L and I had some fights before, but I consider this one the worst.

It was December, I was coming back from work when L messaged me saying she woke up horny and was going to have sex because someone had invited her (she said it was a guy she had hooked up with before her last ex).

I tried talking to her at the time because I was upset, but instead of replying, she went to play League of Legends.

I spent the whole day trying to talk to her about it, but she kept saying to give her some space. We only talked normally again when I didn’t bring up the topic.

The next night, after things had cooled off, I brought it up again. L said she didn’t go through with it, but she also didn’t admit that it was a lie. She just said she lost interest.

So I told her about N and how N had invited me to go out (which was true). I said this girl didn’t seem romantically interested in me—she seemed to want friendship only. She had invited me twice for coffee and once to a book club she was organizing with her friends at her house.

I told L and asked if I could go. I even said that, if she wanted, we could date and I wouldn’t go. That I was only considering it because she didn’t want a relationship with me.

L said it was fine, but from her tone, I felt it wasn’t.

The next day, L made plans with her cousin and pretended to be on a date just to make me jealous. That’s when she finally admitted she had said all that just to test me. She also compared me to her exes.

She blocked me on WhatsApp, and in desperation, I ran out of the house to go see her and brought a bouquet and some things she liked (energy drink and chocolate) to try and fix the situation. I also messaged N, said we couldn’t talk anymore, and blocked her.

In the end, L and I made up, but everything got even worse.

Some time after the fight, L said I screwed up by blocking N, and even though she told me to unblock her, I insisted on keeping her blocked.

Eventually, I started thinking it over and realized I had been a jerk to N, and it didn’t make sense to keep her blocked because of L.

L had always been honest with me from the beginning and said she didn’t want anything serious (even though she showed otherwise). She always made it clear I was her best friend.

Because of that, a few days ago, I ended up unblocking N and apologizing. She accepted the apology but said she didn’t want to be involved in this drama anymore.

The thing is, I didn’t tell L that I had unblocked N.

On Saturday, we went out for coffee and were talking until we brought up the topic of our last (now second-to-last) fight.

She ended up wanting to see the girl’s profile, and after a bit of pressure, I admitted I had unblocked her.

From that moment, her mood changed during our outing and she wanted to go home. That night we were supposed to watch Big Brother Brasil together, but she didn’t want to anymore. After midnight, she sent me a video crying. I tried talking to her, and she said I wasn’t honest with her.

Sunday came, and things only got worse. She said all she wanted was honesty and told me I was never honest with her, that I always lied, and she didn’t want a lying friend.

I kept trying to calm her down, but it just kept escalating. She called me, cried harder than ever before, and asked for N’s profile.

She followed N, N talked to me, and I explained the situation. N was pissed at me, said L and I were both crazy and immature, and that she had bigger problems than this. She said she never had any romantic interest in me and that the whole idea of friendship was dead. Then she blocked me and L.

I told L what happened, she asked for screenshots, I showed her, and it made her feel even worse. She sent a long message saying she forgave me but that it would be better if we went our separate ways. That she couldn’t pretend nothing happened.

I insisted and insisted until she got angry and blocked me (something she said she wouldn’t do).

I got blocked on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and several fake Facebook accounts I created trying to talk to her.

I even went to her house with a chocolate bar and a letter saying I was at the park near her place, but she didn’t show up or unblock me. She only unblocked me after I started sending 1-cent Pix transfers to her bank account, just for her to see the messages. She replied very rudely, told me not to bother her, and blocked me again.

L ended up messaging my mom saying I was harassing her and that she’d go to the police if I kept doing it. My mom talked to her, said she liked her but that, for both our sakes, it was best we stayed apart. L played the victim, said she was trying to move on, but I kept bothering her.

My mom came to talk to me and told me to stop bothering L and asked what had happened. I explained the whole story. My mom thought it didn’t make sense. She messaged L again, said she had talked to me, and also said it didn’t make sense for L to be mad at me since we weren’t even dating (which she always stated and confirmed again to my mom). She said my social media and phone were mine, and I could block or unblock whoever I wanted. I didn’t need to give anyone explanations for that.

Some time later, on Wednesday, things got even worse. I had lent my phone to my mom to check some stuff on my bank app. Everything was fine until suddenly my mom started arguing with someone on my phone. When I checked, it was L.

Basically, even after I stopped bothering her, L kept posting lots of indirect messages on Facebook saying she preferred to be seen as the bad one, that it was a blessing in disguise (livramento), that she didn’t want dishonest people, etc. She posted all of this while having me blocked and while still having my mom on Facebook (she knew my mom was there). At first, she posted on her stories so my mom would see it, but later she started posting it on her feed.

My mom got tired of it, took a screenshot of one of L’s indirect posts, and posted it on her WhatsApp stories, indirectly calling L toxic.

L saw it, liked the story, and reacted with a clapping emoji, but behind my mom’s back, she unblocked me and tried to turn me against her. She said now she understood why I was messed up, because my mom was just like me, and that it really was a livramento.

Long story short, L and my mom had a big fight. I still tried to calm things down with L, but she never apologized. She told me to delete all our messages, not to share her address, and said this could turn into something serious. She also said she had sent my mom’s audio messages to the police (which was a bluff).

I tried a bit more, and she said it wouldn’t work, and that it would be better if we stayed away from everything. She blocked me and asked her cousin to block me too.

It’s been a month since I last talked to L… and it hurts so much...

Even though my friends and family, who know the whole story, say she was toxic, I still miss her. If she came back, I would definitely take her back and try to fix everything...

I keep thinking that, if I hadn’t been so emotional and had just kept N blocked, L might still be here...",2,1746405616.0,BPDlovedones,2,1.0,False
1keyyny,https://i.redd.it/f6lls8li0vye1.jpeg,Looking for a link to “I Let His Mistress Win the Engagement Ring”?,"The day we were supposed to get our marriage license.

My boyfriend turned off the alarm and intentionally drove away, ensuring I’d miss the appointment. By the time I reached the registry office, I was greeted by the sight of his friend Miriam standing beside him, both dressed in matching white shirts, posing for the camera. Their closeness was evident, their smiles bright and carefree. Upon noticing me standing nearby, she had the nerve to blame me.

""It’s your fault for being late! We almost lost our spot!""

""Thankfully Miriam was here to help. We just took a little keepsake photo, you don’t mind, right?""

""Not at all.""

I laughed softly as I slipped off my engagement ring and handed it to his so-called friend. The ring, which had always been a bit loose on my fingers, fit hers perfectly. My smile grew.

""Wear the ring for the photo; it feels more genuine that way.""

Clayton's expression shifted immediately.

""Adaline, what are you doing?""

""Nothing much. I was up late working last night, feeling a bit worn out, so I'm heading home.""

I turned to leave, but Clayton caught my arm suddenly.

""Hold on, it’s almost our turn. Don’t worry, the photo with Miriam is just digital. Only ours will go on the documents.""

Miriam approached, her demeanor fake-friendly as she linked her arm with mine, her voice overly sweet.

""Oh, Addie, I’m so sorry.""

""I just thought it’d be a shame to end things right before the wedding, so I wanted a photo to remember it by. Had I known it’d cause a misunderstanding, I wouldn’t have come.""

""How about this? Once you two get your license, lunch is on me!""

She waved her ring-clad hand teasingly in my face.

I glanced at the two of them holding onto me, their matching shirts, identical rings, and even their unconscious synchronized movements indicating a long-standing familiarity.

""No thanks, you two enjoy yourselves.""

I shook them off and left amid the curious stares of the staff.

Miriam pouted charmingly, tugging at Clayton's sleeve.

""Clay, is Addie mad at me? I shouldn’t have come; it’s all my fault.""

Clayton’s expression darkened, and he dismissed her concerns.

""Miriam, it’s not your fault. If Adaline can’t appreciate what she has, that’s her problem. Forget her, let’s continue.""

After leaving, I hesitated for a moment before setting my phone to do not disturb. Then my stomach growled, so I found a place to eat.

Thinking back over the past five years, all our arguments leading to near breakups were because of Miriam. Barely an hour into our dates, Clayton would invariably be called away by her messages.

So when I saw them posing so affectionately for their photo, it felt like a weight lifted off my chest, and for the first time, I felt a profound sense of relief, a release from a stifling atmosphere.

After getting home, I washed up and fell into a deep sleep.

I slept soundly, with dreams where familiar voices called my name.

The next day, I woke naturally to find Clayton sitting at the table, sipping coffee. As soon as he saw me, he adopted a superior attitude.

""Adaline, what’s up with you? Waking up so late, my suit isn’t ironed, my tie isn’t ready. What am I supposed to wear to work?""

I looked at him perplexed.

""You can handle it yourself, can’t you? I didn’t plan on preparing anything for you.""

Clayton was furious.

He slammed his coffee down and hit the table, glaring at me.

""What’s your problem? Is it really worth it over something so trivial from yesterday?""

""I’m not upset at all.""

""I know you’re still mad about yesterday, but I only see Miriam as a friend. Of course, I’d help a friend in need. Look, next time we’ll get an afternoon appointment; surely you won’t oversleep then?""

""I’m not angry. If you want to help her, go right ahead. I have no problem with it.""

""Could you at least be nicer to Miriam? She...""

""There’s no need to explain further about you and Miriam; I get it. You’re like two peas in a pod. I’ve got things to do, so let’s drop this.""

I cut him off, grabbing my makeup bag and heading into the bathroom.

It was the first time I didn't want to hear him defend Miriam, and I faced him with indifference.

I added her on facebook, it was a long time ago but I dont think she knows me and if I exist and before she has a girlfriend, but now she's single ever since last year and I just followed her ig around early of April. 

During College week, which was 3 weeks ago she was there on our school, and there was that day we started to do eye contact. The longest was 5 seconds, the next day, we did eye contact again but I always pull away bcause of my anxiety. It was Tuesday when we have 3 different encounters. 

The first was, I was on a stall, trying out rings to figure out my ring size with my friend until my friend mentions that she's coming and saw her from afar so I look up to confirm and she was, and our eyes met, then I looked away then when she walked, and stopped by the stall where I was and my friend, she just said randomly ""The watch looks cool."" The pointing the watch while her gaze was om me then after she walks away with a friend. 

The second encounter was me and my friend was standing by near the coffee stall where she was sitting by because probably she's friends with the owner. So while standing by, she just go by behind us, my friend noticed it while I was focused during the car show, so my friend mentioned, she keeps pointing or signalling my direction with her friend and I also felt shivers like somoen was staring or looking at my back, not to mention I was wearing a backless top. Then she suddenly just run by my side that caught me off guard, she seems hyper it actually startled me a little. 

The third encounter same day, when I was walking my friend to the gate then just in time I was returning back to the entrance when she come out with her motorcycle and her gaze was on me again, and I caught her again but I pulled away because of my anxiety acting up. 

Then the next day of the college week, I go to school alone then we've encountered again, we did eye contacts, there was this time when we literally just walked by in front of one another and we were quite close when we did the eye contact and it was intense but sadly I break the contact because I hate my anxiety. 

There's also this day when she slide into my dms on ig but just to ask about the winner of the battle of the bands because I was there to that day too and we did eye contact. So i replied then yeah she replies bragging her previous major (radtech) and saud thank you to me then I replied welcome with hahaha then she last chatted me by reacting heart to my message. 

It made me sad, wishing she could add more to the convo. And also I noticed when she's pretty famous here in our school and has lots of followers, and lots of friends in my school too but why did she bothered asking me that when she knew a lot of people that she is closest with that goes to same school as me and ask them instead of me that I am a complete stranger to her. 

The next days of the collegian week we always did eye contact and not to mention even though she's working now, we always crossed paths every week after the college week atleast for once or twice coincidentally and doing eye contact and I know she already recognize me includes my face and name now knowing we've been mutuals now and I've been sending her signals on ig by liking stories, posting songs on my note but never replying to her stories because of anxiety again. 

Not to mention, she's been liking my stories not always but frequently whether it is my face, about school, and even the useless stuffs, she likes my stories. She's the first viewer and liker always when it comes to my stories and same as me to her. I added her to my close friends list and also her adding me too, to her close friend list. 

The last time I saw her we eye contact again but this time I smiled at her then she was already looking at me while I was about to walk pass to her and then she gave me a nod but not a normal nod but rather a slightly swag nod then I look away smiling, failing to keep my composure. 

I was with my friend to who had witnessed it and of course we've laugh.....but seriously I don't know what to do anymore. She's still there everywhere. I haven't seen her this week too so...... I am seriously losing my mind over her.",0,1746405159.0,lesbiangang,0,0.4,False

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and the occasional postcard, and I'd like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to also give that to someone else as well.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. *My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal* \- cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

***Basic and personal details of myself and the people I like to engage with:***

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US.

*I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion* \- it's one of my most desired interaction regardless of the form of relationship. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

*The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.* Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.

On that, *being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.* We're in a written realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, defeats the point of this, does it not?

*More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

*I'm INTJ and am Type 5.* I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

***More details of my exchange preferences and goals:***

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so don't think how we start is necessarily how we'll need to be forever.

My go-to communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items or more artsy sorts of communication. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue, depth and meaning, and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

*Think we could have a great exchange?*

Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

*Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance.* If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details.

* Rent: $1,800/month per person  
* Utilities: Just over $100/month per person (includes internet)  
* Move-in: Anytime after July 4  
* Lease: We’d sign a new lease together

Hey! I’m looking for a new roommate to move in sometime after July 4. My current roommate is moving out, and the spot will be open in our 2 bed / 1 bath apartment on 105th Street in the Upper West Side / Manhattan Valley area.

**About Me:**I’m a 23-year-old science teacher at a middle school in the Bronx. I work Monday–Friday, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and I’m usually in bed by 10:30–12:00. I’m up around 6:00 AM but keep quiet in the mornings. On weekends, I stay up later and like to host friends occasionally—totally cool if you do too.

My hobbies include playing guitar, gaming, and cooking (I’ll probably offer you samples). If you play an instrument, even better—I love to jam and sometimes perform at open mics. I’m laid-back when it comes to shared responsibilities: I keep things clean but don’t sweat a bit of clutter. Ideally, we’d be friends—my door is rarely closed.

**About the Apartment:**The apartment is a 2 bed / 1 bath on the third floor. The available bedroom has a closet and gets good natural light. The common room has two windows and is connected to a small kitchen with a gas stove/oven, dishwasher, microwave, toaster oven, and Keurig.

The bathroom is compact but has a bathtub, and there’s a fire escape right outside the kitchen window. In the living area, we’ve got a small table with chairs, a futon-style couch, a Yogibo, and my CD stereo setup.

Pets are allowed—I know someone in the building with a dog. It’s generally very quiet, and sound doesn’t travel much between units.

**About the Area:**We’re a short walk from both Riverside and Central Park, with quick access to the 1 train for an easy commute downtown. The neighborhood is pretty relaxed but still has plenty of solid bars, restaurants, and coffee shops around.

If this sounds like a good fit, shoot me a message—I'd love to meet up or give a tour.",1,1746404046.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The backpacks featured in this guide prioritize a balance of style, comfort, and functionality.

**Laptop Compartment Protection**

The laptop compartment is paramount. we're looking for dedicated, padded sleeves that can accommodate laptops up to 15.6 inches (and some that can handle even larger sizes). Superior models incorporate shock-absorbing foam and a suspended design to prevent direct impact to the bottom of the pack.Internal dimensions are always specified accurately, ensuring your device fits snugly and securely.

**Ergonomic Design and Comfort**

Comfort is queen. Adjustable, padded shoulder straps are a must, preferably with breathable mesh to prevent sweating. A padded back panel with ergonomic contours helps distribute weight evenly and promotes airflow.Some backpacks feature sternum straps and hip belts for added support, especially useful when carrying heavier loads. The designs consider the female physique, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit.

**Stylish and durable Materials**

It’s not even a big deal - she’s a full-time content creator I guess, and that’s her job. But I can’t believe some people live their whole life like this.

Again, not her fault, but ugh. It sucks. I get that people need to make money but once you *see* it, you can’t unsee it.

I think I’m just burnt out and bitter. I’m drowning in work and school, and meanwhile she’s doing haul videos and slow-mo coffee shots. It’s not even that I think she’s a bad person - it’s just boring as hell once the illusion wears off.

I think the bubble really popped for me once I started watching her vlogs. But honestly, if she’s enjoying herself and it’s a comfortable life for her, it’s not my place to judge.

## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee-scented candles boast a combination of high-quality ingredients, exceptional fragrance throw, and impressive burn times. Each of these elements contributes to the overall experience and longevity of the candle.

**Wax Composition:** the type of wax used greatly affects the candle's performance. Soy wax, known for its clean burn and environmentally friendly properties, is a popular choice. Beeswax offers a similar clean burn and a subtle honey aroma. Paraffin wax, while cost-effective, can produce more soot and may not be as environmentally conscious. Higher-end coffee-scented candles frequently enough utilize a blend of soy and beeswax to maximize fragrance throw and burn time while minimizing soot. The specific composition is a critical factor in determining the air quality impact of the burning candle.

**Fragrance Oil Concentration:** The concentration of fragrance oils determines how strongly the candle emits its scent. A higher concentration typically results in a more potent aroma, filling larger spaces effectively.However, excessive fragrance can be overpowering, so a balanced concentration is essential. Look for candles that disclose the percentage of fragrance oil used, ideally between 8% and 12% for a strong but not overwhelming scent.Also, the source of the fragrance oils (natural vs. synthetic) greatly impacts the scent’s authenticity and complexity.

**Burn Time:** Burn time indicates how long a candle will last before the wax is completely consumed. Longer burn times mean more value for money, especially for candles that are frequently lit. Burn time is influenced by wax type, container size, and wick type. Premium coffee-scented candles often boast burn times ranging from 50 to 80 hours or more. Ensure proper candle care, such as trimming the wick before each lighting, to maximize burn time and prevent tunneling.

**Wick Material:** The wick material plays a notable role in the candle's burn quality. Cotton wicks are common and provide a consistent flame. Wood wicks, while less common, offer a crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace, adding to the ambiance. The wick shoudl be appropriately sized for the candle's diameter to ensure even melting and prevent the wax from tunneling. Lead-free wicks are a must to ensure safety and prevent the release of harmful chemicals into the air.**Scent Profile Composition:** Coffee-scented candles rarely offer a single coffee note.The best options include balanced combinations. Popular complementary scents include vanilla, caramel, hazelnut, chocolate, and spices like cinnamon or nutmeg. A well-crafted scent profile creates a complex and enjoyable aromatic experience. Read product descriptions carefully to understand the layering of scents and ensure they align with your personal preferences. Its also helpful to check for reviews that describe the scent's authenticity and overall pleasantness.

**Container Design and Material:** Although secondary to the main scent,the candle's container plays a pivotal role in the aesthetic appeal and contributes to the overall ambiance. Glass jars are the most common, offering visibility of the melting wax. Ceramic containers can add a touch of elegance and are often reusable.The container’s design should also align with the candle's scent profile. A rustic burlap wrap might suit a more masculine coffee scent, while a sleek metallic jar might complement a more modern, sophisticated blend.

(EDIT)in ZZZ their first 3 weekly boss doesn't cost battery(Resin).

They have coffee that can be drank once a day that replenishes 60-80 Battery(Resin) everyday.

You can meet up and hangout with your favorite Character. Even makes a comment if you try to take a picture of them

Talent, Character upgrade, Weapon Upgrade materials are open all week (means you don't have to wait certain days to farm certain material).

Their version of Sanctifying elixir is no so hard to get, cost less and has no limit on which artifact you use it on.

Farming Artifacts isn't as hard as to get as it is in genshin because in ZZZ you can dismantle the useless artifacts, and if the artifact is already upgraded, it refunds some of the money you used and materials. They have their version of Strongbox too but cheaper cost.

If your resin gets full, for every 8 minutes that passes after being full, it turns into backup resin that you can use to replenish your resin (max 2400).

They have a dedicated training ground that you can use to practice rotation. And you can select what mob and level.

Doing weeklies gives you a material that you can use to exchange with resources.

Overall Genshin would be a lot better if they have these QoLs",0,1746402881.0,Genshin_Impact,58,0.47,False

i have been searching for a job for over a year. i live in the middle of nowhere currently but am moving to a city soon. the issue here is i have been trying to apply for jobs ahead of time so im already set up for the move, but everywhere either wants a degree or a 110% working-bodied robot. 

i was a late grad due to covid, was supposed to grad 2 years early and have full ride by 2021 for science. we all know what happened to that. and now im effed. all i want is to survive. i dont even want to make a whole lot just enough to eat something other than ramen since i have dietary restrictions.

disabilities getting in the way: 
-combination PoTS AMPS that im 99% sure is misdiagnosed EDS since my shoulders and hips like to dislocate as they please, im just too broke for genetic testing and my dad refuses to go to doctors(EDS is a majority genetic issue, would have gotten from him)(symptoms of this affecting ability to work: fainting if standing too long and blood clot risk due to blood pooling in feet, joints dislocate when lifting/moving more than 20lbs, chronic pain bad enough i used to use non-prescribed-pills as a teen, however i now am a strictly medical cannabis user since its non-drowsy/addictive for me personally)

-Bipolar and ASD, as much as i like to convince myself i can blend in i know i cant. if im having a bad day no matter how much i try to hide it sometimes the bottle is too full and i break down, however im fairly good at keeping it out of the eyes of customers/coworkers. but having it known i have these things is an issue for being hired, but the employer not knowing is an issue for keeping the job because if im overstimulated and want to put on some noise cancelers the employer needs to know why. 

the ASD/Bipolar one is the main hurdle i feel. especially due to the lack of a degree and my mom heavily sheltered me and i genuinely dont know how to apply for a job or interview(“you cant work untill your done with school!! and you cant have your own money!! but also im seceretly doing crack for 3 years and going to spend all of “our”cough cough your college fund- moneyyy on drugsssss and refuse to admit its my fault your homeless nowww yayyyyyyyy!!!”) i was essentially isolated aside from school/partners till i was 19(not even 2 years ago).

let me repeate- however ashamed i am of this- i am nearing *21 years old* and dont know how to cook, apply for jobs, do taxes, talk to people, make friends, present in public, etc. i had to have my lawyer apply for me for snap/public aide but than i had to move to another state on a whim and all of it was useless. im good with money because i had to teach myself to be. but due to my mom sheltering me for 18ish years than throwing me to live in my boyfriends truck and dissappearing i have a grand total of 3 months of job experience i got because my boyfriends was a hiring manager at a coffee shop before it got shut down :D looks super good and definitely will get me hired right?! 

i apologise for all the sarcasm in this im just so frustrated and i hate the fact i can feel myself withering away on my diet of strictly ramen and minute rice because its all i can afford with the quarters i picked up in the wal-mart parking lot unless canned beans are on sale. i havent had a fresh vegetable in years. i tear up whenever i think about it honestly. all i want is money to eat something that doesnt make me feel worse and worse every day and exascerbates my inability to function. i havent had a not-plant-based protien that wasnt from mcdonalds in over a year. and just want to buy a effing chicken breast and some effing potatoes or something. but i cant. because the hundreds of jobs i have applied to decided i wasnt even worth of a deny call/text/email, let alone the idea of giving me a job. 

all the websites i can find for applying to disability friendly no college degree jobs are locked behind a paywall or lie about the no degree aspect. im sorry i lost the genetic lottery with being lower(lets bffr lowest) class, disabled mentally and physically, and still having enough self respect to not go back to selling myself for food again.",1,1746402711.0,jobs,2,1.0,False

My ex is undeniably one of the most captivating and amazing individuals I've ever met and I feel incredibly fortunate to have shared 7 incredible years with him. Our relationship was built on a foundation of love, respect, and trust, and I'm grateful that we were able to experience such a deep and meaningful connection with each other. Even though things didn't work out between us, I'm still so appreciative of the time we spent together and the memories we created. He's an amazing person who deserves all the happiness in the world and I'm quietly sending him love and positive vibes. 

Me and hun were together for 7 beautiful years but broke up about 6-7 months ago (see previous post beneath this one for context), but only recently rekindled and decided to stay friends. Fast forward Wednesday, he told me that feelings are growing for another girl and out of respect for her, he’s no longer going to stay in touch with me. I think I took the news fairly well….or atleast I thought so because I was sitting at my favourite LOCAL coffee shop today, sipping on a latte and suddenly the thoughts of my ex just started flooding back in. 

Next thing I knew, I was getting VERY teary and of course, because the universe loves a good dramatic twist, his friend happened to be sitting just a few tables away. I just ran out of there wiping away my tears - went home and indulged in a Ben & Jerry's Netflix marathon. Tears are still flowing but I'm sending good vibes to my future self, where heartbreak is just a distant memory.

I think I’ll sleep it off because I can’t shake this feeling. Hopefully I’ll be ok in the morning. I’ve removed him from my social media and blocked his number so I guess that’s few steps towards recovery. 

I’m just so unsure what I’ll do moving forward. Any tips is very much appreciated.

I am running the bid with dehydrated mill food recycler food scraps and spent coffee grounds from the coffee company I co-own, as a trial to see the useful and validity of using worms as a coffee green recycling project. Outside of a few worms in one (the hungry bin) of my 6 total bins (3 urban worm bags, 2 garden project 2 towers) having possible string of pearls / sour crop, it's worked exceedingly well since February. I have around 15k worms, in set parameters. 4 (including this bin) with majority india blue mixed with true rw (jim's and then urban worm co) and then 2 with pure 2 lb x 2 bags of red wigglers in each bag one with just shredded cardboard and one with coco coir and cardboard. Each bin doing very well, the wigglers doing the best in terms of volume and uniformity of castings, the india blues are just thriving and breeding the most. All bins booming, and tons of cocoons and wisps. After my research is done I think there is enormous potential in the coffee industry, our main recyclable products generated are chaff (paper skin of beans), spent grounds from large scale cold brew brewing , cardboard,  and a massive amount of burlap and jute bags that can be shredded... the industry pays to get these removed. A worm farm, at scale can breed, generate profits from castings and worms at $40 a lb, be truly green and ethical, and turn a costly recycling headache for any large scale plant or trade house into a money making endeavor with minimal upkeep. 

In my farms the mill recycler scraps seem to be doing well, as we are testing using dehydration on all the products above plus food scraps and other food products our plants, cafes and trading companies generate into an easy to store and spread pre blend. In the future hot composting / pre compost would be greener but we need speed for the trial.

I tried calling Sarah right away and when she didn’t pick up, I messaged her 911. We met up, and I told her everything, including that James asked me to grab coffee. She got quiet and seemed really upset. Now she’s being distant and doesn’t really want to talk to me.

So for context I (23F) have been with my parter(25M)( calling him Jake for stories sake) for 2 years. I have a daughter(5F) from a previous relationship and I co-parent with her dad the best I can. My partner and I met in 2021 and started off just as friends but got serious a year later and began dating in 2023. The problem starts with his ex fling,we’ll call her Jane for stories sake. So Jane and I have been friends since we were about 9 and we drifted apart throughout secondary school but became really close again in 2021 when she introduced me to Jake. We were all very good friends at the beginning and would often spend days with each other hanging out but Jake and Jane were in a bit of a fling. It lasted for about 2/3 months and Jane saw it as love and Jake saw it as a breakup healer as he split up with his long term girlfriend 2 months prior. In 2022 I started having ✨extracurricular activities ✨ with Jake  and Jane was fine with it as we did have a conversation about it but unfortunately that year Jane had left me in some unfortunate situations and wasn’t necessarily the best friend and we didn’t speak to each other anymore and were not on the best of terms. We still are not on best of terms and don’t speak anymore but Jake and Jane do. For context Jake has recently bought a house for us and we’re are renovating it together but his grandparent recently passed away aswell. Jane is the type of person that borrows money and “forgets” to pay it back. Between Jake and I she owes us about £500. Her and Jake used to message 2/3 times a week but she has been an awful friend to Jake over the past few months ,and when he messaged to say about a family members passing she not only thought it was a joke she then took a month to message asking if he was okay. She recently sent him a message more or less saying how she misses him so much and she is so sorry and how much love she has for him and he’s told her off saying about it but she’s sent 3/4 messages asking him to meet her for a coffee and a catch up. This makes me feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable especially since he keeps replying but he brushes it off saying he’s just being friendly and doesn’t want to hold a grudge and also I don’t get a say in who he speaks too. So since then I’ve been quite annoyed with him as not only does he speak to Jane he speaks to 2/3 of the previous ✨spicy partners✨ he has been with whereas I have cut all of mine of apart from my daughters dad out of respect.

I used to have no idea where my money was going. a coffee here, takeout there, or that app subscription I forgot to cancel it all piled up. One day, I added it up with my friend and realized I was spending about $1,200 - 1,500 a year on coffee alone. My buddy laughed and said, “Dude, you could’ve gone to Italy with that!” That hit me hard—I kept thinking, “Man, that could’ve been a new phone or a weekend trip.” 😅😅

That moment pushed me to take control of my spending. Most budgeting apps I tried were either too complicated or loaded with finance jargon, so I decided to build something better: [**xWalletPro**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-tracker-ai-xwalletpro/id6744541339), my side project. It’s designed to **catch those sneaky small expenses in seconds** and give you clear insights, like “Wow, $200 on takeout this month?” **No cluttered charts or Wall Street terms** just info you can actually use.

What makes [**xWalletPro**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-tracker-ai-xwalletpro/id6744541339) different is its **AI forecasting tips**. Unlike standard apps that just show what you spent, it predicts what’s coming, like “You might overspend on groceries this month.” It’s a game-changer for planning bigger goals, like a vacation or a new gadget.

Right now, I’m experimenting with some forecasting features to make it even smarter, but I’d love to hear what you think about the first version. For the predictions to get really sharp, I’d recommend logging your expenses regularly for a month or two it learns your habits over time.

[**xWalletPro**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-tracker-ai-xwalletpro/id6744541339) super simple: no setup needed, works offline, and keeps your data private (a must for me). **It’s live on the** [**App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-tracker-ai-xwalletpro/id6744541339) **if you want to check it out.** I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I quit in 2022 for about 2.5 months, then again last January. I made it to July when I caved and bought one. I work at a summer camp and have a really intense/stressful job and just needed something. I thought I’d quit after camp. Well! I didn’t lol. 

Im a high school English teacher! I tell these kids CONSTANTLY about not vaping. I tell them I used to and quit - so I’m really feeling like a fraud and a major loser. So I’m quitting again. I went to run a stair loop on the dunes where I live, I made it about 90 seconds before feeling like I needed an inhaler. 

Another aspect of my quitting journey - Jesus and prayer! Now if this isn’t for you / your beliefs please be considerate or ignore :) I have really developed a deep and personal relationship with Jesus and fully believe He will get me out of this addiction. Vaping has become an idol! It’s the first thing I grab in the morning, and hit it while I read the Bible lmao. It’s an idol. The enemy is using it to tempt me, break me, waver my faith. I am super excited to invite Jesus into this quitting journey this time. I have verses to read and memorize when I’m having withdrawals, and I pray constantly. If anyone else is a Christian and wants to talk about this, pls message me !

I find that always having a beverage helps me. Dr Pepper, Diet Coke, COFFEE. you already know. Also sugar free mints. I used to eat sour patch watermelon last year but I’m trying to cut down sugar (going to be extremely hard while also quitting nic I know).

Honestly, I’m starting to think this stuff might be fake. Either that, or it’s just poorly made, because I’ve never had such a high dose of caffeine not affect me at all.

So, I’d be really cautious if you’re thinking of buying this. It didn’t work for me at all, and I’m not sure what’s going on with it, but it might not be what it claims to be.

1kexie0,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/1kexie0/hotel_reverie_concept_is_ridiculous_and_made_the/,Hotel Reverie concept is ridiculous and made the episode unwatchable,"A new startup wants to cheaply remake movies by putting actors in a simulation. Okay, fine, pretty classic concept. We're putting a twist on an old classic romance movie by genderswapping the main character since a famous actress is the first one to volunteer. Okay, sounds interesting, and it makes me happy to see gay characters in mainstream places like this. Beside the new black female actress now in the main role we are changing nothing else about the movie and in fact the entire goal of the simulation is to be as close to the original movie as possible, and when inevitably things go differently from the original movie, everything breaks, the character AIs become sentient, and we trap an A-list actress inside a frozen black-and-white old movie world for multiple months and run the risk of killing her or leaving her there forever. *What?* Did we lose a thread here?

I just don't understand the point of the technology. I can understand the theming and the satire of bad remakes or whatever but in what world is this going to be something that somebody considers putting in the time and obscene amount of money into producing? Especially when it's so ridiculously prone to error--both the software itself and the things they probably should've thought through for more than two seconds? Did they at no point consider double-checking that Issa Rae could play piano, seeing as it's an important plot element and it screws up the entire movie when she can't? They didn't consider giving her a little direction or making sure she knew her lines before she entered the movie, seeing as the tiniest mistake butterfly effects into the entire plot breaking down? Why did they even bother to make AI characters that realistically react to everything and a world with internal logic that changes based on what happens, if they're just going to desperately try to stick to the plot of the original movie anyway? Who is going to go see a movie in theaters that is just the same exact old movie, black-and-white and everything, except now the main character is a different actress? What is the point of a bunch of nerd characters sitting outside going ""exposition delivered"", ""romantic tension rising"", are these metrics we're measuring? Are these statistics we're keeping track of? What is the point of saying ""character backstory delivered"" like it's some big operation when she's literally just reading the line off the script? Hello? Can anybody hear me? Why is my wife's boyfriend so much more attractive than me? It's just so full of plot holes and inconsistencies and it killed what I think could've been a very good love story otherwise. Like, I love the love story. It was genuinely heartbreaking, and I do think it was fairly well-acted, especially on Issa Rae's part considering the script she was given. But every time something sad happened all I could think about was that stupid nerd dude going ""exposition delivered"" and spilling his coffee and then I was too busy laughing to actually feel something. Just ridiculous all around

Lance found himself behind the counter of 'Bean Hive', a small, cozy coffee shop tucked away in the heart of Maplewood. The scent of freshly ground coffee beans filled the air, a comforting aroma that reminded him of simpler times. His life as a soldier had been a whirlwind of noise, adrenaline, andLean muscle memory commanded his movements as he navigated the espresso machine, his large hands handling the delicate porcelain cups with surprising gentleness. This was a far cry from the rough world he'd left behind, but it was a welcome change.  
  
The bell above the door tinkled softly, signaling a new customer. Lance looked up to greet them, his gaze meeting that of a woman standing at the threshold. She was an intriguing blend of elegance and approachability, her eyes as warm as the sunlight streaming through the window. A cascade of chestnut curls framed her face, softening the stern lines of her charcoal pantsuit. Crow's feet crinkled at the corners of her eyes, hinting at a life filled with laughter and maybe even some sorrow. She was, in a word, beautiful.  
  
""Good morning,"" Lance said, his voice a low rumble. He was used to the gruff camaraderie of the army, but his time tending bar in off-duty hours had taught him the importance of a pleasant tone.  
  
""Morning,"" she replied, stepping closer to the counter. ""I'll have a large Americano, please."" Her voice was just as warm as her eyes, with a hint of something else—was it curiosity? ""You must be new here. I don't think I've seen you before.""  
  
Lance nods, extending a hand. ""Lance. Former soldier, now barista. Trying something new.""  
  
Her hand was soft, her grip firm; she held his hand a moment longer than necessary. ""Eloise. Regular here. Welcome to 'Bean Hive', Lance.""  
  
As he prepared her coffee, Lance felt a strange sensation in the pit of his stomach. It wasn't the adrenaline-fueled excitement of a mission or the thrill of a successful combat operation. It was something different, something he'd never felt before. A subtle, intriguing spark, kindled by her touch and nurtured by her smile.  
  
Eloise watched him work, her eyes following his hands as he filled her cup and added a precise amount of milk. ""You're wasted here, you know,"" she commented, once he'd handed her the drink. ""In the military, I mean. You've got a gentle touch.""  
  
Lance chuckled, a deep, resonating sound that seemed to fill the entire shop. ""I've always been a bit of a contradiction, Ms. Eloise.""  
  
She smiled, taking a sip of her coffee. ""Call me Eloise. And I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy exploring those contradictions.""  
  
As she walked away, Lance couldn't help but feel that he'd just stepped into something far more intense than any battle. A conflict of a different sort, one that didn't involve bullets or explosions, but something just as powerful—desire. And it was brewing.

I told her I did not feel comfortable with that and she said she understands and would not grab coffee with him. Then fast forward to April I leave the country for work and I am gone for a month and come home to go on vacation for a week. We had a perfect vacation sharing how much we had loved each other and that it’s almost time for the next step but the last night of vacation she hands me her phone to set an alarm in the morning and I notice two dm’s from the same guy she had asked to get coffee with. I read through the messages and found out she had went to his apartment when I was out of the country. Then reading messages after they shared sexual memes and he had made comments about him being horny and her sending winking faces. I found out that before we dated him and her had a sexual relationship as well. I do believe her that nothing happened that night but still with sexual messages her knowing that I did not want her to see him would I be over reacting and would I be stupid to give her a second chance. I feel completely betrayed and have lost trust that I don’t think I could ever restore. But our love was so perfect before this. She said he is just a friend and she only views him as a friend but this is the one thing I asked her not do in our relationship was to hang out with other guys alone as I would never with a female. ,38,1746400887.0,AmIOverreacting,48,0.96,False

Am I even considering this?,"So. About a year ago, my ex (about to turn 17, I had just turned 18 – yes, yes, I know) broke up with me out of the blue. No warning. One day we’re cuddling and watching movies, the next he’s decided – with the confidence of a man twice his age and none of the life experience – that our relationship is a “distraction” from his mental health journey and needs to go.

Yes of course I was sad he wanted to brake up with me, but I was so mad that I didn’t get any say in it. No conversation, no pause, no “can we try a different approach?” Just BOOM: “I have decided. It is over.” I could just sit there (sobbing like a real girl boss) and helplessly watch him tare appart everything we had built up.

It sucked sooo much. He was my first real relationship. First kiss. I was all in. And while we had issues (immaturity, lack of communication, him treating my favorite movie like an annoying YouTube ad), I didn’t think that was how it would end.

Anyway, he distanced himself from me, unfollowed from instagram and we’ve only seen each other at church since. I’ve been civil. Friendly, even. But since it was him who took a step back, it was up to him to decide where we stood now. And it was kinda far appart and not much more then awkward nods and polite ”all good?” ”yes, what about you?” ”I’m good”. Yeah…

That was until a few days ago. Out of nowhere, he follows me again on Instagram and sends me a message: “Hey, can I ask you something?” And I’m like…huhhh??

Turns out he wants to talk to me about some things so we got coffee, and he told me he’s felt like shit and been meaning to apologize since November. He said he was selfish, thought only of himself, treated me poorly, and deeply regretted how he handled both the relationship and the breakup. He admitted he was too ashamed to talk to me until now.

Then he asks if we could be friends again. And maybe, way down the line, when we’re Real Adults™ with jobs and emotional maturity, maybe see if something more could happen between us – if we reconnect on a deeper level.

So here’s the dilemma: I’m not heartbroken anymore. I’ve healed. But I still care about him. I still think he’s cute. And I miss the good parts we had. There’s definitely some part of me that wants to believe in second chances. But also… I promised myself I wouldn’t go back. And I TOLD HIM when he was braking up with me ”then this is goodbye forever, because you cant just come back like nothing happend”. And I stand by that, that the version of him I dated is not someone I’d ever take back. Am I betraying myself just by considering this?

He says he’s changed. He wants to prove it. And I want to believe that people grow. But how do I even navigate this? Can you actually be friends with someone you loved without slipping back into old patterns? Is it stupid to even entertain this “maybe someday” fantasy? How do I protect myself and keep an open mind?

1kexcs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_castSlide/comments/1kexcs0/sweet_little_sub_switch_or_soft_dom_mommy_wanted/,Sweet Little Sub Switch or Soft Dom Mommy Wanted,"Hey there! I’m a guy in my 20s, a switch who loves to play both sides—sometimes a dom-leaning daddy with warm protective vibes, other times melting into golden retriever vibes that just wants to be loved and good. I’m looking for a real connection that could grow into something long-term, with either:

* An adorably subby little girl / switch who loves affection as much as I do
* OR a soft dom mommy (gentle but in charge)

About me: I'm a good looking dude like to dress and feel nice, stay in good shape and clean up nice I'm told. Have a good job and friends, I just hope to find someone that can connect with me on a deeper level. Physical touch, romance and passion are my love languages, I love love bombing and affectionate people. I thrive on PDA (hand-holding, sneaky touches, proud kisses), cuddles, and playful power exchanges. My kinks include praise (giving/receiving), breeding, begging, breath play, age/milk/cum play, and love bombing—think sensual, not strict. Not into receiving pain but I can give it if you are really into it, even if I don't enjoy causing others pain, do really like power dynamics and taking and giving power, submission and connections. I am happy to facetime so we both know we are real haha, we can also call, text and just get to know each other more. I think consent and trust are very important to be vulnerable in relationships and make them last. I don't really expect much to come from this post but I hopeful someone special might read this, just like I found my way on here.

You might be my match if:

\- You’re a warm, affectionate partner who loves teasing or being treasured

\- You’re open to soft domination, switching, or leaning fully subby

\- You want dates, laughter, and real intimacy alongside kink

Let’s chat and see if we click! I’d love to share what we like, hopefully we share interests outside kink too, but of course it would be great if we share fantasies or can help each other fulfill them, eventually meet up for coffee (or a cuddle session) and then some capital f fun. Serious inquiries only—I’m here for the kind of connection that lasts.

Would be very nice if you are into exploring switching dynamics and alternating between sub and domme, one day I could be calling you my good girl and domming you, and another you might tell me I'm a good boy and we get wild. 😉

1kexbix,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kexbix,I am really liking the Breville Luxe Brewer Thermal - BDC465,"*I would first off like to say that I never owned the previous version -- the Precision Brewer -- so I won't be able to tell the difference between the two except from what I have read in the manual of the prior version.*

# What's New

* The tank is removable
* The tank has a charcol filter
* The screen is new
* The dial and start/cancel button are now the same
* Vents on the side and back of control center
* Longer Cold Brew times
* New look
* You can customize bloom volume (which seems new to the US model, maybe)

# What's Removed

* There are no more Fast, Gold, Strong or Over Ice settings any longer
* There are no settings to select basket type, or standby time.
* The pour over option seems to have been removed as well.

# My take on the Removed Settings

There has been a lot of confusion online about the *Fast*, *Gold*, *Strong*, *Over Ice*, *My Brew*, and *Cold Brew* settings on the older Breville models. From what I’ve gathered in various forums:

* *Cold Brew* and *Over Ice* could only be used with **20 oz or less** of water
* *Gold* was limited to **40 oz or less**
* *Strong*, *Fast*, and *My Brew* worked with **any water amount**

With the new **Luxe model**, it looks like Breville tried to **simplify the brewing experience**. The differences between *Strong*, *Over Ice*, *Fast*, and *Gold* were subtle—mostly just changes in water flow, bloom time, and brew ratios. But because those settings weren’t always intuitive, it was easy to end up with **mediocre coffee**, especially compared to machines like the **Oxo** or **Moccamaster**.

I think Breville made the right call here. While some might feel like options were removed, **all of the capabilities are still available** through the *Custom* menu. It’ll take more user feedback to know for sure, but my guess is this simplification will be seen as a **positive change**.

# Key Improvements in the Luxe Model

* **Removable Water Tank** A major convenience upgrade. In setups with limited overhead clearance (like mine), you no longer need to slide the whole unit out to refill.This might actually be my favorite feature of the Luxe. It alone could make the upgrade worthwhile if you’re in the market for a new coffee maker.
* **Adjustable Bloom Volume** Lets you control how much water is used to pre-wet the grounds and how fast it flows—giving you more control over flavor extraction.

# In Conclusion

This is a solid coffee maker, and has features that are unique to the market. I am not sure if it is better than Mocamaster or Oxo, as I have never owned those machines. However it does make an excellent cup of coffee with some fresh coffee beans that I had ground for a french press.

I used to have no idea where my money was going. a coffee here, takeout there, or that app subscription I forgot to cancel it all piled up. One day, I added it up with my friend and realized I was spending about $1,200 - 1,500 a year on coffee alone. My buddy laughed and said, “Dude, you could’ve gone to Italy with that!” That hit me hard—I kept thinking, “Man, that could’ve been a new phone or a weekend trip.” 😅😅

That moment pushed me to take control of my spending.

What makes [**xWalletPro**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-tracker-ai-xwalletpro/id6744541339) different is its **AI forecasting tips**. Unlike standard apps that just show what you spent, it predicts what’s coming, like “You might overspend on groceries this month.” It’s a game-changer for planning bigger goals, like a vacation or a new gadget.

Right now, I’m experimenting with some forecasting features to make it even smarter, but I’d love to hear what you think about the first version. For the predictions to get really sharp, I’d recommend logging your expenses regularly for a month or two it learns your habits over time.

I know this might be able to be posted in a college group but I wanted to post it here because I thought maybe there would be a wider audience.

After coming to uni, I couldn't find a job. I couldn't afford gas or to eat if it wasn't in the dining hall, I couldn't afford to go get a cup of coffee. I had no friends and my classes were a struggle. Between not being used to the pace of classes here, I was also in 16 credit hours and taking multiple, very difficult classes (notoriously difficult classes according to everyone I tell). 

My second semester was just as difficult, but now I was on academic probation and forced to take a class. I was able to get my grades a bit better but not enough to push me into academic satisfaction. This semester (my third), I was finally able to get a job and save up money, which helped a lot. My grades were improving bc I wasn't as nervous about everything and while they weren't perfect, I was doing well. My only issue was math and I am pretty sure I'm not going to get any higher than a D in it.

About a week ago, I found out that to keep my classes for next semester, I had to pay the school essentially all of the money I had saved up to help pay towards my bill. Because it was late, they added $30 dollars towards my outstanding balance and I have been forcing myself to leave bed ever since. I don't want to get up, I make myself eat because I have to or I'll get too tired during work, and I barely have enough energy to shower or study, although I force myself to do so.

Currently, I don't think my grades are high enough to keep me in college and that fact is killing me. I will be existing and suddenly break down in tears. I am having nightmares constantly. I am trying to pack my dorm for move out tomorrow and I started bawling bc I realized I might not be back next semester. 

If I don't come back, I have no plan. I can live with my dad, but he keeps making comments about how he wants me to move out. I am not sure what to do or where to go from here. I am doing my best to study and hoping my finals go well but I am genuinely not sure what to do. The plan was to graduate college. I didn't have any other plans.

It was just a coffee shop date, 50/50 split, and while I felt a bit awkward, I realized he was really into me. He then started talking about a second date and all, and I kept saying ""Ah I think I have to work that day"", but he kept going through the days of the week and I crumbled. 

I have some trauma with men not handling rejection well, including a guy telling me once at a party that he could twist my arm so hard that it'd break, so when it comes to this sort of thing I capitulate often just so I can keep the peace. I don't think this guy was that caliber--I just don't think he understood social cues and was just into me more than I was to him. And I will admit, I mask any feelings of disinterest purposefully and try to seem happy. 

So I sat on it a few days, trying to talk myself into being excited, but every time I thought about it I would get really worried and be dreading it. I talked to my friends and they told me to just pull the plug now since there were no concrete plans made yet and he hasn't really wasted any money in trying to buy dinner or something and it was a first date--there's no feels involved presumably.

 So I did, I wrote him that while I thought he was a great guy, I didn't feel any romantic connection and I hope he finds his person. I didn't mention anything in particular he did wrong or my trauma, as I've heard guys say that they don't like that. I sent the message, deleted my account (I checked with the app I was using--deleted account messages stay unless you unmatch them prior--also deleted the app because I realize that I need to take a break from dating to work on my anxiety).

 I feel relieved I also feel terrible, like I'm a heartless bitch who led him on. I can't stop thinking that I'm a liar, an assjole, etc. ",13,1746399919.0,dating_advice,25,0.93,False

1kex0ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/3rdGen4Runner/comments/1kex0ny/rhythmic_grinding_noise/,Rhythmic grinding noise,"Mine has been developing a rhythmic grinding noise that is most noticeable beyond 2nd gear, being most noticeable in 5th.  It sounds like a coffee grinder being turned on and off.  Gear selection, clutch position, and throttle position don’t seem to change the noise.  It does increase frequency and sound level with speed, being about twice a second at 70mph.

A shop I normally take it to cannot seem to find the problem right away.  They looked at basically everything on the front end.  The front diff fluid was clean and very little metal material on the magnet.  Bearings felt okay, they told me.  Best they could say is to come back upon it getting noticeably worse.

I can’t say the exact moment it began, but it seems to have started after testing the 4x4 on a gravel parking lot several months ago.  Yes, I did put it back in 2wd before going back on pavement.

It would be difficult to capture on video.

If anyone else has experienced this, I’d appreciate any insight.",1,1746399844.0,3rdGen4Runner,1,1.0,False

This seems like the best place here on reddit to post this to hopefully reach like-minded people. A little encouragement and support goes a long way.

This is my eating and exercise plan to go from about 250 to 170.

I get up drink a full glass of water...and toast 3 slices of multi-grain/whole wheat, high fiber/low carb bread. With it, I eat about 300 grams of plain bio yogurt with low/no sugar...I usually sprinkle a splenda in it.  
  
Later in the morning, I drink a big coffee with stevia and milk...and eat 250 grams of no sugar cottage cheese along with my coffee.  
  
In the afternoon, I eat a big salad with varied veggies and pour 100 grams of 100% tahini over it. There is a ton of protein in this tahini jar...kind of like natural peanut butter...but whole sesame seeds.  
  
And then in the evening, I have a nice portion of leftover roast from the weekend or chicken or fish, mixed with either sauteed vegetables or with a side of oven-roasted vegetables, or sometimes with a yummy vegetable soup.  
  
I make sure to drink at least 3 liters of water or seltzer a day. And I started to exercise-walk everyday for about an hour outside with my daughter at night.  
  
I hope to successfully lose all of my excess weight (mostly around my middle) following this eating & exercise plan, within a year. I started this recently at 255 pounds, and am now 10 pounds thinner and healthier...on the road to about 170.",2,1746399775.0,loseit,2,1.0,False

I plan to make my mother a coffee shelf for Mother's Day. Something simple, just a 2/6 board, some sort of brackets, and hooks on the underside of it to hold mugs. The top will only likely hold a basket with coffee grounds and possibly a potted plant, so I am not expecting any major weight issues. I am a little tight on budget, being a college student, but I have access to a workshop and basically any tools I might need. 

I would love to use a jigsaw and angle grinder to create a fake live edge, but I am worried that might look a little strange on a wood like poplar, and woods like cherry are hard to find in my area and are a little expensive. I also plan on using a dark stain to match the rest of her pantry. Does anyone have any recommendations for wood type?

1kewz8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1kewz8n/stupid_things_i_do_in_pokémon_sleep/,Stupid Things I do in Pokémon Sleep,"Some questionable things I do in game I maybe wouldn’t recommend, but am writing anyway. Maybe you’ll get inspired, or maybe I’ll finally get the counselling I desperately need. Enjoy!

1. Plan recipes for several days. Doing that right now for the salads event, and my mind is breaking. I have like 5 meals ahead before ingredients become an issue, including 2 each of the coffee salad and yogurt. Might not even do dinner tonight just to have that much more ready to go for tomorrow

2. Run ABC mons. Yeah, don’t do that. You massively lose consistency. I don’t actually have any unlocked yet, but I’m still gonna run em, especially my Walrein and Steelix which are both berry specialists (and therefore ingredients are usually an afterthought anyway). The 1 attractive thing about ABC is variety, but it’s not really that great, to be honest 

3. Withholding skills. Ingredient Magnet has this neat interaction where it will ask you to empty your bag before it triggers. This literally means 1 ingredient below a full bag. You can use this to your advantage in 2 ways. My Vaporeon for example has an inventory of 26. A level 7 IM is 24 ingredients. A single trigger will nearly fill that inventory, and then no more triggers. But it will continue to gather until it can finally let loose, and in Vaporeon’s case, a skill specialist, can save up ANOTHER trigger for even more ingredients later. More recently, with Metronome and Skill Copy, this can be somewhat of a spoiler as to which skill will show up (kinda ruins the mystery, IMO, but whatever). On the other hand…

4. Trigger IM on a full bag. Some of my favourite Pokémon are berry specialists with IM. This lets them load up for sneaky snacking on PRINCIPLE, while doing what they’re supposed to be doing. It’s extremely limited for just these guys though, since you lose out on the ingredients they get sometimes. Remember Walrein and Steelix? Yeah, they’re my favourites to do this on

5. ALL of the Helping Bonus. Easily my favourite gold sub. My Gardevoir and Vaporeon both have it. HB is helpful even if only to justify having a mon in a slot near constantly. I wouldn’t recommend stacking a whole bunch at once, but I have. Kinda funny to see, but it’s a lot better if you have decent speed in the first place

6. Test the waters. I’ve been burned many times by a hungry mon scoring a crit on the Great Biscuit I just bought to PRECISELY fill its gauge. I will now use a regular biscuit just in case this happens. Fun thing for newer players; Shinies will ALWAYS be filled by ANY biscuit. And this is why I…

7. Keep 100 points for safe keeping. You never know when a Shiny will show up, and that is not something you wanna miss. Even if they’re not great, it is a player’s NIGHTMARE to miss a Shiny

8. Reset the rewards. You can instantly reset the daily rewards by changing your bedtime. I will do this just to get early rewards again faster. I wrote a whole thing about this when apples were MUCH weaker, and I have used that many times for just blasting colas out. Would only recommend once you get the second diamonds reward; you miss out otherwise 

9. Overload the bag. Tickets will let you go over the bag limit IF you are below the limit before using them. Combining this with daily rewards means the technical maximum for the bag 744 ingredients (M and 15 honey). I might occasionally do this to make emptying my bag for a big pot slightly less painful, not often caring what the results are. Somewhat helpful for Master 20 with a ticket active. Not really  good idea if you’ve got semi decent mons already 

10. Write all of this down. You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. You’re awesome, and you’re doing great. Sometimes you just need to reflect on yourself

1kewyeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1kewyeh/collagen_conclusions_my_joint_pain_story_with_a/,"Collagen conclusions, my joint pain story with a happy ending","Ten months ago I decided that losing my joints was unacceptable and started looking at supplements.  I found Collagen, did research, and found a great metastudy ([my post is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1egoe0p/good_metastudy_on_collagen_supplements_for_pain/)).  Some results appear to take 3 months to show up, so might as well get started, right?  So I started taking it and nearly immediately had results... and issues.  

I'm a supertaster.  It is not a superpower, it is hobbling: there are many things I can't stand, including coffee.  Collagen's aftertaste is not palatable for me. I struggled for months to get enough without puking, disgracing mug after mug of tea with this cowhide-derived powder (do not get me started on the taste of the seafood-derived stuff!).  

* 5 grams daily: reduced pain
* 10 grams daily: can lay on my side to sleep for a few hours
* 15 grams daily: couldn't choke it down 

Nevertheless after the first 2 weeks I got my thumbs back and could open jars again ([my post on that is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1ex3799/holy_that_worked_collagen_supplements_for_joint/)).  So I kept drinking my disgusting cowhide-tasting-tea.  I was averaging 5g/day, though I'd miss whole days sometimes.  I got HRT in the middle of this struggle and didn't find it helped with my joint pain at all, only the Collagen was making a difference, lucky me. 

Three weeks ago I found that I can just do 3 shots in the morning, each with 5 grams, and get all 15g in.  I just hold my nose and have a bite of something strong immediately after.  I rarely gag when it's only three glugs and then a reward.  It's a quiet morning ritual now, and the dogs appear to enjoy cheesy wakeup time.  I did a spreadsheet to find the cheapest; Vital Proteins is super popular but also very expensive.  I get Anthony's right from the company, subscribed, at 2/3 the price of VP and no perceptible loss of quality. 

My joints feel bulletproof now.  I've added 5 minutes to my rowing and half an hour to stoop-labor gardening.  I sleep on my side all night, not just to fall asleep.  My shoulders don't ache after yoga or after I get up from lying on them.  I buzzed and shoveled out the patio's weeds last week.  I can open difficult jars and use power tools again!  So I recommend trying this for those of us who have joint pain -- because (especially for those who are not supertasters) it's such an easy solution compared to acquiring HRT, or therapy for/waiting out frozen shoulder, or any of those awful connective-tissue issues I hope none of us have to suffer.  

Best of luck to all of us. ",147,1746399666.0,Menopause,49,0.98,False

I typically write this sort of stuff off with him, in the spirit of not holding against him what he wasn’t taught.
