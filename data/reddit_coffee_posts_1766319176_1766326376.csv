I know this is probably a question you get a lot, but I’ve never really been a work from a coffee sho person. I have a ton to do this week though so I thought I’d get cozy somewhere.

The thing is- I’m very picky with my coffee. If I wanted shitty coffee and a ton of seats I’d go to a Panera or something.

I love Kinship, but their Steinway location has minimal seats and no bathroom. Their Astoria park location is way too far.

Any great coffee shops with solid espresso drinks that you can get real cozy at for a few hours?

I'm an older female, divorced and feeling like I'd love to go on a date. Just coffee or a drink with someone interesting and kind. Maybe something more with the right person. Ultimately want to find the real love of my life but I'm not in any rush. I'm fit and attractive and I have my life together. Would be so nice to find someone who isn't crazy. I'm hearing that's a tall order these days, lol.

I've heard some apps work better than others, depending on what city. Someone told me recently that Hinge is the best for the Nashville area? Are there any that work better for this area? I'm guessing they're all the same but thought I would ask here regardless.  
  
Is it worth paying if you're female?

I'm aware that it's a bit of a minefield, takes time and effort and that going in with zero expectations is the best plan. 

Thanks for your input, if you have any to share.",0,1766326098.0,nashville,1,0.5,False
1ps7c32,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelSafetyStories/comments/1ps7c32/your_sister_deserves_it_more_my_dad_said_when_i/,"Your sister deserves it more, my dad said when I blew him away with a fancy trip to Greece for his retirement. So I smiled and agreed, making sure their dream vacation turned into the craziest mess they would never forget.","Hey everyone, I never thought I'd be the guy sharing this, but let’s just say my family trip gift turned into something none of us saw coming. It started as a sweet retirement surprise for my dad, but when they decided to swap me out for my sister, I figured it was my turn to show them what being taken for granted really feels like. Hang tight, this tale's filled with family drama, a bit of karma, and the most tranquil cup of coffee I've had in my life.	I’m Greg, 31, a dude working as a doctor in San Francisco. I’d been cooking up this Greece getaway for six months, not for me but for my dad. The guy was finally retiring after 40 years in construction. I thought he deserved something big, not some lame watch or a “Best Dad Ever” plaque. I wanted him to see the world — the blue rooftops, the Santorini sunsets, the food, the ocean breeze, all the luxury vibes.	Flights, a swanky hotel, a cliffside suite with a private pool, tours, a private driver, a local guide, fancy dinners—all under my name. The plan was simple. Surprise my parents at the airport, hand them their tickets, and let them know their son had officially outdone every Hallmark commercial out there.	I got to the San Francisco airport early, holding this little sign that said, “Welcome to your retirement gift.” Yeah, a bit cheesy but it felt right. They were coming in from Denver, and I hadn’t seen them in nearly a year. Honestly, I was pumped. Their flight landed, people started pouring out, and then I spotted them. Mom in her beige cardigan, dad strutting like he still owned every job site he’d ever worked on. But right behind them came something that gave me a chill. Jessica.	They’d just flown in from Denver, and the Greece flight was set for early Saturday morning. The plan was for them to crash at my place overnight before the big send-off — my 37-year-old sister. The same Jessica still living in my parent’s basement, still sorting out her life, still complaining about back pain from gaming too much. She was rolling in with a pink suitcase the size of a fridge, waving like this was her celebration. 	“Hey Greg,” Dad called out, grinning. “Surprise.” Uh, surprise? I forced a smile. “What’s she doing here?” Mom wouldn’t meet my gaze. Jessica smirked and said, “Oh didn’t Dad tell you? Dad laughed like he had the best news. “Your sister needed some fresh air.” So she’s taking your spot. You don’t mind, right? I stared at him as my little welcome sign started drooping in my hand. My spot. “Yeah,” he said, patting my shoulder like it was no biggie. “You know how much Jessica’s been through lately. We thought this trip would help her recharge.”	Recharge? That hit me like an awful punchline. Jessica spends most days lying around with a controller in hand. What exactly was she recharging, her Wi-Fi? I smiled, but it wasn’t a nice smile. Nice? I didn’t know my gift came with a “replace the giver” option. Dad laughed again, totally missing the sarcasm. “You’re always so funny.” Funny wasn’t what I felt inside. It was more like, really? You’re doing this again? But I’d figured out long ago not to show that. You give them an inch of emotion and they’ll turn it into guilt or pity for Jessica. So I just stood there, calm and collected, watching my parents fuss over her like she’d just come back from war.	Mom gave me that nervous half-smile she always wore during these moments, like she knew it was wrong but didn’t have the guts to call it out. “We thought you’d understand,” she said softly. “You’re always so busy with work anyway. You’re successful, so you don’t get to have feelings.” Jessica yawned and chimed in, “Don’t be mad, Greg. You wouldn’t even enjoy all the walking and sun anyway.” I looked at her gigantic suitcase, then at her. “Wouldn’t want to interrupt your busy rest schedule.” Her smirk twitched for a second, and that alone gave me a bit of satisfaction.	Dad clapped his hands. “Well, let’s get moving, Greg. You got the car, right?” Of course, I did. I rented a black SUV just for this. The irony of driving them to the luxury getaway I paid for wasn’t lost on me. Jessica hopped into the front seat without asking, scrolling through her phone like she owned the place. Mom sat in the back, quiet, avoiding any eye contact. I wasn’t mad in a shouting way. I’d passed that stage years ago. I was calm. Too calm. 	The kind of calm that comes when you finally decide you’re done being the family’s safety net. When we rolled into my driveway, Dad stretched his arms and said, “You always have the best place, son. You should be proud.” I am, I said. Especially since I worked for it. He laughed, thinking I cracked another joke. As they unloaded their bags, I caught Jessica’s phone pointed at herself. ""Leaving for Greece. Can’t wait for the beaches,"" she said to her four followers.	I stood there, hands in my pockets, watching her post a trip she didn’t earn, with money that wasn’t hers, on a vacation that wasn’t meant for her at all. And as silly as it sounds, I smiled. Because right then, as she posed in front of my car, I realized something: they may have replaced me for the trip, but I still held all the reservations. And that meant the game wasn’t done yet. Not by a long shot.	I unlocked my place and started hauling luggage. Funny how fast people turn into “help yourself” tourists when someone else is covering the costs. I dropped a suitcase in the guest room, another by the bathroom, and tried not to make a face when Jessica tossed a comforter on the couch like she’d claimed the best spot. “Your place is so cute, Greg,” Mom said, nodding. “So proud of you.” Dad clapped me on the shoulder. “You did good, son. This will be great for Jessica.”	Yeah, I said. Glad you think so. I kept my voice light because yelling at sixty isn’t worthy and tempting them for a scene would just make it more dramatic. There’s a difference between punishment and spectacle. I wanted results, not noise.	“You know Greg did all this right,” Dad said, smiling like he’d built the itinerary himself. Jessica laughed, loud and self-satisfied. “He’s such a sweet brother.” She looked at me like she expected confetti to rain down on her. I smiled and played along. Sarcasm is a handy tool, dull enough that most don’t notice the sharp edge. “Yeah, I did the hard part. Picking the restaurants with comfy chairs,” I said. Nobody caught the jab. 	After dinner, I excused myself. I had a late-night meeting with my laptop. Which was true in the sense that I was meeting whatever version of justice I could drum up from a chair and a Wi-Fi connection. My travel account had been my little thing for months. Every confirmation, every payment, every special request was sitting there under my profile. That’s the plan. When you’re the account holder, you pull the strings. And tonight, I planned to cut a few.	I logged in, the dashboard loading with that soft blue from the travel site I used. The Greece itinerary was right there. Outbound flight, return flight, three hotels, two private transfers, a winery tour, a local guide for two days. All paid. All pretty. My fingers worked in silence, like a doctor at work. First, the hotels. I clicked into each reservation, hit cancel, and confirmed. The system asked about refunds. Some suppliers had non-refundable rates but would give partial credits. Fine. I didn’t want them refunded. I wanted the illusion I let some charges stay as credit in my account so if they glanced at it, it still looked real.	Next, private driver? Gone. The tour operator? Canceled. I left a few small fees linked, little financial breadcrumbs just to fluff the look of legitimacy on the PDFs I planned to create later. No fraud, no fake documents. Just a bunch of administrative clicks from the one in charge, the airline. That was my knife.	I’d booked the outbound/return as separate one-ways, so dropping the return was easy. One click. The system asked me to confirm. Are you sure? It said like some conscience in code. I hit confirm and the cancellations showed. While processing, I saved screenshots of each cancellation notice. I copied old booking confirmations too, the ones still showing the hotel name, the guide’s email, the transfer code. Those originals would come in handy as props. Folks glance at a printout and think it’s gospel.	The next day, I planned to hand them those props. They’d never know how they strayed. Then I printed, formatted the pages to look official. Headers, dates, little logos. Nothing forged, just screenshots and old confirmations that would convince anyone in a hurry. I slipped them into a clean white envelope and wrote in neat letters: open when you land, just one more touch.	In my desk drawer, I found an old expired company card, nothing active, just a relic. I slipped it into a small leather holder with a note saying backup card. If you need it, treat yourselves. I knew it wouldn’t work for a cent, but it looked the part. I didn’t want to scam anyone. I just wanted them to feel that sting of expectation. Then reality hit. I tucked the envelope into a drawer, planned to grab it in the morning, checked the locks on the doors, and turned off the living room light.	I hit the bed with steady breathing I’d used on late nights at work. Bon voyage, freeloaders, I murmured into the dark. The plan was set. The next day, I’d give them their tickets, and they’d waltz right into it, smiling, excited, and totally convinced they had the world handed to them.	Morning came, bright and annoyingly cheerful. Saturday flight day. I got up early and leaned into the role of the good son. If I was pulling this off, it had to look genuine. I whipped up breakfast, the whole shebang. The smell filled the kitchen, and by the time Mom walked in, I was halfway through plating. “Wow, someone’s up early,” she said, surprised. “Big day,” I replied, flipping an omelet. Can’t have Greece on an empty stomach. 	Dad walked in, rubbing his eyes and grinning. “You’re spoiling us.” “Yeah,” I said. “That’s the plan.” Jessica appeared last, still in pajama pants and clutching her phone like it was glued to her hand. “You didn’t make oat milk lattes?” I handed her a mug of black coffee. “It’s organic,” I said. She made a face, plopped down, and I carried their luggage outside. 	The morning fog was lifting off the city, humming to life. Just as I shut the trunk of the SUV, my neighbor, Mrs. Lanson, strolled out with her tiny dog. She smiled at the sight of the bags. “Heading somewhere exciting?” she asked. Dad puffed up immediately. “Our son planned a Greece trip for us. Retirement celebration.” Mrs. Lanson clapped her hands. “How wonderful. Greece. What a good son you have.” I grinned. Oh, they’re going to love every second of it. 	We piled into the car, the drive to the airport breezy with light Saturday morning traffic. Jessica talked non-stop about restaurants she had to visit, souvenirs to buy, and what pictures would get the most likes. Mom asked if everything was confirmed. “Every last thing,” I said, and it was, just not how they thought.	At the terminal, I parked and started unloading. A porter came over and Dad tipped him like he was already on vacation. I kept the envelope in my jacket pocket, which had their printed confirmations and the expired card tucked neatly inside. Inside the terminal, Jessica complained about the check-in line. “Can’t you just do that priority thing?” she asked. “I’ll handle it,” I said, heading to the kiosk. 	I was still the booking holder, so the check-in system let me print their boarding passes and luggage tags. While I worked, Jessica argued with a staff member about her carry-on size. When finally our turn came at the counter to drop off bags, the airline agent smiled. “Heading to Athens, right?” Dad nodded enthusiastically. “That’s right. My son set up everything. Private driver, hotel on the cliffs.” 	The agent started typing, then looked up. “Where are you staying? Do you have a hotel reservation?” I jumped in quickly. “Oh, it’s through a local company, I booked it direct. Way better rates that way.” I laughed lightly and she nodded, relieved not to pursue details. “Got it,” she said, printing luggage receipts. Crisis averted. I glanced at Dad, who was too busy on his phone to notice anything.	After security, we stopped at the entrance to the gates. It was the usual pre-flight goodbye scene. Mom checking her purse for the tenth time, Dad patting his pockets, Jessica snapping another photo. I pulled out the white envelope. “Here,” I said, handing it to Mom. “Open it when you land.” 	She smiled. “What’s this?” “Just confirmations and a little something extra.” I looked at Jessica. “Everything’s prepaid, but just in case you spot something nice, that card’s loaded. Treat yourselves.” Her eyes widened. “Seriously?” “Yeah,” I said, straight-faced. “Consider it pocket money.” Mom looked touched. “You didn’t have to.” Dad interrupted. “He’s always thinking ahead. That’s my boy.”	Jessica slipped the envelope into her tote like it was gold. “I’m going to buy something designer,” she said. “I’m sure you will,” I replied. Their flight was boarding soon so they headed for the gate. Jessica gave me that smug smile, the kind that always got under my skin growing up. “Try not to miss us too much, little bro.” I smiled back. Not in the slightest.	I walked back through the terminal feeling lighter than I had in years. The drive home was calm. The city looked different when you weren’t the one always giving. When I parked in my driveway, the house felt quiet in the best way. I poured myself another coffee, settled on the couch, and finally let out a breath. They were 35,000 feet in the air, smiling, thinking they were living my generosity. And I was home free, enjoying the first vacation that actually belonged to me.	That peace lasted almost a full day, just long enough for them to cross the ocean and time zones. By the next morning, my phone started buzzing nonstop across the counter. Mom, then Dad, then Jessica. One after another, like an alarm I had no idea I set. I let it ring. Then a few minutes later, a text popped up from Dad. “We’re here, but there’s a problem with the driver. Call me.” I grinned. “Problem with the driver?” That sounded like the opening act. I didn’t reply.	Five minutes later, another text. “No one showed up. We’ve been waiting over an hour. Please check.” Then came the first voicemail. I hit play, just wanting to hear his tone. “Hey son, not sure what’s going on. The driver never came. Can you reach out to the agency and see what’s happening?” He sounded calm, hopeful even. The kind of calm that wasn’t going to last. Then another came in. Mom this time. “Sweetheart, the hotel said they can’t find our reservation. Maybe it’s under your name.” That made me laugh out loud. It was under my name alright, just not active anymore.	I flipped the phone face down and started a load of laundry. By the time I came back, I had seven new voicemails and a bunch of text messages. I played the next one on speaker while folding a towel. It was Dad again, voice tighter now. “Greg, the hotel says the booking was canceled weeks ago. They’re saying we need to make a new one. Call me back immediately.” I didn’t.	Then came Jessica’s first message. Voice note, of course. “What is wrong with you? The tours are invalid, the driver’s number doesn’t work, and the airline says our return flight isn’t even booked anymore. Are you kidding me, Greg?” I paused folding to chuckle. “Guess they found out about the return tickets,” I muttered to myself. More messages rolled in one after another. “We’re trying to reach the tour company. All canceled. Do you know how embarrassing this is? You’re paying for this, Greg.” I poured another coffee. The more they panicked, the calmer I felt.	It wasn’t even satisfaction. It was just quiet relief, watching all the pressure I used to carry land where it belonged. A few hours later, another text from Mom. “We had to book an Airbnb. It’s not great. Please call us.” Attached was a photo. I opened it. They were standing in front of what looked like an ancient yellow apartment door with peeling paint. The caption read: “This is all we could find.” Jessica’s face in that photo was priceless. Wrinkled nose, hand on her hip, sunglasses crooked. I scrolled down to another message, furious this time. “Your stupid card doesn’t work. It got declined at dinner. Did you actually think this was funny?” I took a sip of coffee, smirking. Oh, I did, I whispered.	Then Dad again. Voicemail 14, still trying to sound authoritative. “I don’t know what game you’re playing, but you need to fix this, son. You ruined your mother’s trip.” “I ruined my own trip the second you swapped the guest list,” I said calmly. “For a second, nobody spoke. Even Jessica froze. Dad’s face twisted like I slapped him. “You think you’re clever, huh? We raised an ungrateful child.” “Yeah,” I said. “You raised two kids. Actually, you just never stopped raising one of them.” Jessica gasped. “Oh my God, you’re unbelievable.” “Thanks,” I said. “Now, unless one of you needs medical care, this is my workplace, and I’d appreciate you leaving before I call security.”	That broke the quiet. They spun around and stormed out, Jessica muttering something about exposing me online. The hallway door slammed so hard the frame shook. My nurse poked her head in a second later, eyes wide. “Was that your family?” “Unfortunately,” I said, taking another sip. “But they’re discharged now.”	By the afternoon, the smear campaign began. It kicked off with Mom posting long, teary paragraphs about how their own son ruined their lives, how they were humiliated and broke, and how kindness was repaid with cruelty. Then Dad jumped in, calling every relative he could reach to tell the Greece story but with a twist. In his version, I’d hacked their trip, stolen their money, and laughed while they suffered abroad.	By Friday, my phone lit up with messages from cousins, aunts, and folks I hadn’t heard from in ages. “You went too far, Greg. They’re your parents. Show some respect. Everyone makes mistakes. You should have forgiven them.” One relative even texted, “You’re lucky Grandpa doesn’t hear about this. He’d lose it.” I grinned. Perfect, I mumbled. Exactly who I wanted to hear about it.	Sure enough, two days later, Grandpa called. Now, my grandpa’s not a man who wastes words. Retired military, sharp as ever. The kind of guy who can silence a room just by exhaling. He said, “I’ve been getting calls all week about you and your parents. I’m done hearing both sides secondhand. We’re having dinner tomorrow night. Everyone’s coming. We’ll settle this like adults.” I could hear the clinking of his old pocket watch chain over the phone. It was the sound of finality. “Sure,” I said. “Tell everyone I’ll be there.” 	He paused. “You’re not going to start yelling, are you?” “No, Grandpa,” I said, smiling. “I’m bringing receipts, not a megaphone.” He chuckled once. “That’s my boy.” When I hung up, I stared at my calendar. Tomorrow night, 7pm, the grand showdown. Part of me felt exhausted already. Another part felt ready. I wasn’t going to explain, beg, or justify anything. I didn’t need to. They wanted an audience? Fine. Let them have one.	I spent that night combing through my files. The travel receipts, booking confirmations, the email trails. Every single thing was organized and printed. I wasn’t there to argue. I was there to end the noise. Permanently. Before I left work the next day, I told my receptionist, “If anyone calls claiming to be my mother again, tell them I’m in—busy for the next 10 years.” She laughed, thinking I was joking.	That evening, I drove across town to Grandpa’s place. The same one that used to host every Thanksgiving when I was a kid. As I parked outside, I could see silhouettes through the window. Mom pacing, Dad animatedly talking, Jessica scrolling on her phone like it was a shield. Grandpa sat at the head of the dining table, quiet, unmoving. 	I took a deep breath, straightened my jacket, and headed toward the door. On any other night, this would have been just another normal family dinner. But tonight? Tonight was about me not being the family’s scapegoat anymore and showing what boundaries look like. I rang the doorbell once. Grandpa opened it himself, expression unreadable. “Glad you came,” he said. “Wouldn’t miss it,” I replied as I stepped inside. 	The air was thick, tension almost physical. Everyone turned toward me. This wasn’t going to be a fight. It was a reckoning. The whole family was gathered around the table like a court hearing. Grandpa sat at the head, his expression saying one wrong word and you’re done. Mom sat beside Dad, nervously whispering. Jessica scrolled through her phone, pretending she didn’t care. I sat across from them, hands folded, calm as a surgeon before a procedure.	Grandpa cleared his throat. The chatter died instantly. “Well,” he said slowly, looking straight at me, “I’ve heard the stories. You stranded your parents in a foreign country, left them broke, humiliated, and, well, furious.” He leaned forward, eyes sharp. “Is that true?” I met his stare. Mostly his brow furrowed. “Greg, that’s not how family treats family. You went too far.”	I didn’t flinch. They went first. He raised an eyebrow. “Explain.” So I did. I told him everything. But not emotionally, just facts. Calm and measured. How I had been helping them with bills since my 20s, how I paid for repairs, birthdays, flights, and emergencies that somehow constantly benefited Jessica. I described how I planned the Greece trip, a retirement gift meant to celebrate Dad’s hard work, how I saved, booked everything under my account and wanted to make them proud. Then I laid out how it all crashed before it even started. 	“How they replaced me without a second thought. Dad showed up at the airport with Jessica instead of me,” I said evenly. “Told me she needed fresh air, that I wouldn’t mind giving up my spot like it was nothing. Like I didn’t exist.” Jessica rolled her eyes. “Oh, please, you’re exaggerating.” I looked at her. “You took my seat on a trip I paid for, Jessica.” 	The room went silent. Even Grandpa didn’t jump in. I continued. “You all humiliated me that day. Not by taking the trip, but by proving I never really mattered to this family unless I was paying for something.” Mom whispered, “That’s not fair.” “It’s accurate,” I said. “You’ve enabled her for years. Every mistake, every failure. She never faced consequences. I worked my entire life, and you rewarded her laziness by taking my place. So yeah, I let you go to Greece. I just made sure it matched what you gave me. Nothing.”	Grandpa’s expression hardened. He sat back, arms crossed. “We made a mistake,” Dad said, voice rising. “But what you did was cruel, Greg.” “You stranded me in my own family,” I said. “You just finally got a taste of it.” 	Jessica slammed her phone down. “This is ridiculous. You’re all acting like I’m the villain because I wanted to travel. You’re so dramatic.” Grandpa turned to her slowly. “Jessica, be quiet.” She froze. Grandpa rarely raised his voice, but when he did, the air shifted. He looked at her the way only an old man who’s run out of patience can. “You’re 37 years old, still living off your parents, and you've got the nerve to act entitled to others’ work? Your brother gave your father the gift of a lifetime, and you take it because you needed fresh air. Shameful.”	Jessica’s jaw dropped. “You’re taking his side.” “His side is the only one that makes sense,” Grandpa said. “Your parents enabled this, and now they’re crying about consequences.” Dad started, “We didn’t…” Grandpa slammed his hand on the table, making the plates rattle. “Enough. You two raised one child to work for everything and another to expect everything. You took from the wrong one.”	This time the room went dead silent. He turned to me. “Greg. You got receipts?” I nodded and slid the folder across the table. Everything. Flights, hotels, refunds. I didn’t make a penny from it. Just deleted their comfort. Grandpa skimmed a few pages and then looked back at Mom and Dad. “You’re going to pay him back. Every cent. Every booking. Every fee.” 	I clarified that most of the big charges were already refunded or credited back to me. What they owed was just the non-refundable stuff and the hassle they created. Dad’s eyes widened. “Dad, come on. We can’t afford…” “You should have thought about that before stealing from him,” Grandpa cut in. 	Mom’s lip trembled. “We didn’t steal. We just…” “You took his gift and gave it away,” Grandpa said coldly. “If that’s not stealing, it’s something worse.” Jessica crossed her arms. “I’m not paying him anything.” Grandpa turned to her. “You don’t have to. You’re done. No more help from this family. No money, no excuses. You want to live like an adult? Start acting like one.” 	Jessica jumped from her chair. “You’re all toxic. Every one of you.” Grandpa’s voice boomed. “Sit down.” She froze mid-step, eyes wide. He pointed to the door. “Actually, forget it. Go. You’ve said enough.” She stormed out, slamming the front door so hard the windows shook. 	Mom started crying softly. Dad stared down at his plate, speechless. Grandpa stood still, calm. “You two owe your son an apology. Right now.” It took them a moment, but they did. Dad’s voice cracked. “Greg, we’re sorry. You didn’t deserve that.” Mom nodded through tears. “You’ve always been good to us. We just didn’t see it.” 	I nodded. “I know.” We ate in silence after that. The food was cold, the air thick. When it finally ended, Grandpa walked me to the door on the porch. He handed me my folder back. “You handled yourself like a man,” he said quietly. “You didn’t yell. You didn’t throw punches. You showed them the truth. That’s more powerful than anything.” I nodded, smiling faintly. They needed that. 	He nodded back. “They did. But don’t carry their mistakes any longer. You did your part.” I thanked him and walked to my car. The night air was cool, the streetlights humming softly. For the first time in years, I didn’t feel like the outsider in my own family. As I pulled out of the driveway, I glanced in the rearview mirror at Grandpa’s house fading behind me. It wasn’t just revenge anymore. It was closure. 	    At the end of the day, I’m still asking myself the same thing.       Was this justified payback, or did I let resentment turn me into the villain of the story? What would you have done?

1ps7akj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1ps7akj/aiden_aeropress_w_fellow_prismo_espresso/,"Aiden + Aeropress w/ Fellow Prismo = ""Espresso""","Decided to keep the Aiden over the XBloom Studio - mostly because of batch brewing. But there are some things on the Xbloom that really shine. The app, for starters is amazing compared to Fellow's, showing the whole brew process in real time, and super highly customizable. Of course the built in scale and burr grinder are cool too, but it's definitely more to futz with.

There's a recipe in the Xbloom app someone made for Aeropress Espresso-like drink - that is super fine grind, 1:5 ratio, 90ml pour, 185 F, 26 second bloom. With the Fellow Prismo attachment for aeropress, it makes it so it doesn't leak out to brew into the AP (no need to do inverted), and forces the crema out with the rest so you can get a delicious and foamy condensed shot. Not exactly the force of espresso, but super close for not using an espresso machine. I like to use a paper AP filter in addition to the metal one on the Prismo, to filter out the additional cholesterol bits. 

Was trying to see about setting a profile up on Aiden - but the options in the Fellow app are too limited: 1:14 is the lowest ratio possible for a profile in the app., 5oz (148ml) is the smallest pour. Would be great if the app could allow folks to dial in and choose their own ratio and pour amount, by ml that aren't limited to the exact increments they currently do.

Looking like to recreate it on Fellow - would do something like this:

1 cup (148 ml) at 1:5 ratio is 29.6g of coffee. Set up a profile at 185F - run the profile for 1 cup - it will tell you to add 10.7g of coffee (bc 1:14 ratio is the lowest) but add 29.6 instead, with single cup basket and no filter. Put the coffee into the AP and run the profile into the Aeropress with your super finely ground beans, bloom, stir well and press - you get a shot and a half or so of super concentrated deliciousness.

She said we were perfect for each other. Our first date was at a coffee shop, and then we arranged to meet up at a botanical garden the next week. While we were at the botanical garden she told me about her peanut allergy, which she described as life-threatening. I told her that must be stressful, and she said it was. We arranged for a lunch date this week at the end of the date.

After that date I started thinking. I love peanuts and eat them all the time. I put peanut butter in/on a lot of stuff, including my dog's toys, which he drags all over my apartment, getting invisible peanut oil everywhere, I'm sure. I can't see a potential relationship with this woman ever progressing to a serious stage without me changing my diet and habits.

At this point we've only been on two dates, and I think it would be more respectful of her time to not go on a third. So I called her and told her I was sorry, but we need to cancel. She asked if I wanted to reschedule, and I apologized but said I didn't think we would work out long term. She asked why, and I was honest. I said I really like peanuts and would be nervous about potentially harming her. She said there were a lot of safety precautions we could take to keep her safe, and I admitted I know that but don't want to do them.

She said ""wow"" and told me I'm immature. I apologized again, but she hung up. She told my friend what happened, and my friend is confused by my reasoning. She said her coworker said I'm a massive douche. I don't feel like I am. We only went on two dates. Two dates doesn't imply any commitment. I asked her if she agrees I'm a douche. She said she's not sure, but that my logic is ""definitely weird."" Do you guys agree?",2,1766325923.0,AITAH,3,0.75,False

When I got home from my 8 hour shift yesterday, my mom delivered me some devastating news. They were planning to kick me out if I didn’t start cleaning. 

A little background, I work two jobs. 40 hours in total, I still barely make enough. But everyday and on my days off, without fail, I deep clean my parent’s house to the T. All the dishes, litter boxes everyday, vacuum the carpet, sweep and mop the kitchen, clean off the table, pick up the coffee area, do the laundry, take all the laundry that’s folded to their designated rooms, clean and wipe down the office. 

Recently, I’ve had a decline in energy to clean. I am totally burnt out. 

Because after I clean, without fail, 6 hours later when my parents get home, they make a huge fucking mess. 

Candy wrappers everywhere, more clothes on the couch, my step dad’s whiskey glasses gathered on the table and my mom’s cups on her side of the couch on the end table. It’s irritating, literally grates my nerves. I don’t have many days off and at times I don’t return home till 9pm so then, the house will continue to get messy until my day off. 

My mom works too, she works in the mornings so she has the afternoons off. She sometimes does the dishes and folds the laundry but she never puts the laundry away so it lays stagnant on the couch until the cats sleep on it and it has to be washed again. I am stressed. So fucking stressed. 

My step dad wants to kick me out. My mom is a good person but she never puts her kids before a man. So she’ll let him kick me out I’m sure. 

And he wants me to move in with my older brother that raped me and my mentally deranged eldest sister.

Basically my NS said that I was not meeting his unspoken expectations and then when he finally verbalized what they were, the therapist pointed out that they were unreasonable and asked if I was on board with them.  The therapist also pointed out that NS responds with emotion that is out of balance with what is actually appropriate for the moment.   I am at the quiet angry phase where I am just done.   NS said that I and our marriage are a disappointment to him (for someone who lives off his trust fund and hasn’t worked in 12 years.  I own a business).   Therapist said that he can either love and accept me for who I am or divorce.  

Anyway.  In case I slip into feeling like this relationship will work - I had my AI list his abusive patterns:

```
RELATIONSHIP ABUSE PATTERNS - REFERENCE LIST
□ Emotional invalidation and dismissal - Consistently dismisses your feelings, accuses you of being defensive when you try to explain yourself, and makes you feel like your emotions are wrong or inappropriate
□ Gaslighting and memory manipulation - Accuses you of lying about incidents you don't clearly remember, causing you to feel ""disoriented"" and question your own recollection of events
□ Unreasonable expectations and constant criticism - Demands you anticipate his needs (like making hot coffee, noticing when he's home) and criticizes you when you don't meet these unspoken expectations
□ Emotional manipulation through victimization - Consistently positions himself as the victim while making you responsible for his emotional state, saying you should feel ""empathy"" when he's hurt rather than your own valid emotions
□ Stonewalling and communication control - Shuts down conversations when they don't go his way and resists therapeutic communication tools that might level the playing field
□ Making you feel ""set up to fail"" - Creates situations where you can never meet his expectations and you're constantly disappointing him
□ Minimizing your efforts while demanding appreciation - Doesn't acknowledge your attempts to improve communication or be mindful of his feelings, while simultaneously demanding recognition for his own efforts
□ Explosive emotional reactions that intimidate you - Has intense emotional outbursts and admits to a pattern of ""sucking it up until I can't take it and then I burst""
□ Historical incidents of verbal abuse - Past incidents of lashing out and verbal aggression that remain unresolved
□ Controlling your autonomy and interests - Criticizes your activities and interests as barriers to him rather than respecting your independence
□ Weaponizing therapy language - Uses therapeutic concepts and communication rules as weapons against you rather than tools for mutual understanding
□ Creating no-win scenarios - Criticizes you for being defensive when you explain yourself, but also criticizes you for not communicating enough
□ Emotional withholding and punishment - Withdraws emotional support when upset and makes you work to regain his approval
□ Resistance to professional help - Resistant to changing therapists or trying new communication tools that might help break these patterns

As an IEE, I’ve found myself liking an SLI (how surprising right?). It’s actually gone beyond just a crush. I’m interested in Tarot, and I believe he is the soulmate that the cards foretold. The reason I think he is an SLI is because of his clothing style, his love for IEE characters, his very relaxed posture, his Delta values, etc.

​We met once for a non-romantic reason (I shared some spiritual knowledge and gave him a gift). We chatted very pleasantly for a few hours and then went our separate ways after the meeting. He laughed at my jokes the whole time and was very polite. Plus, he paid for my coffee. Since then, because there hasn't been much of a reason, we haven't interacted for a month.

​According to both what the Tarot says and the general advice that one shouldn't ""crowd"" or ""stifle"" an SLI, I feel I should wait for him to make a move. However, I get butterflies every time I think of him! I truly feel the duality.

​What should I do? If he does make a move, how should I react? Could any SLIs give me insights into what you like and dislike? Can you share your experiences?

Maybe today the Daishonin would write “there is no reason to be troubled by the defamatory attacks of former members who park their lives in Sgiwhistleblowrs on Reddit.” The size, shape, and format of defamatory attacks might be different but the basic idea is intact. I will continue comparing what they write there, comparing what I read in publications to what I witness in my own faith. I will respond the best way I can. And when the dust from their attacks reaches my nostrils, I will just have a hearty old sneeze.

>Accordingly, there is no worse disgrace than being lauded by ignorant people who follow every whim of public opinion. This was a conviction shared by Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda, the Soka Gakkai’s first and second presidents, and it is also one that I have embraced, as their successor and third president… 

Yesterday someone on WBers posted an image of Daisaku Ikeda implying that his work could be compared to Jeffrey Epstein’s. It’s a vicious, vicious attack not worth a single byte. But, more concerning, then comes the unquestioning recognition and clapping on by other WBers, led by you, Blanche. You might want to remember, friends over the hedges, “there is no worse disgrace than being lauded by ignorant people.”

Bingo!

Got to run! We are preparing a feasty “Welcome to the Winter Season” brunch with the strongest possible coffee we could find for our feisty friends who perhaps might have some headaches this morning.

What led to this turn of events? I watch as my knuckles, that are wrapped tightly around the hilt of the blade, turn white while crimson blood drips down the palms of my trembling hands. Drip… drip… drip… The sound echoes in the hollow space of his once clean room, louder than the ragged breaths just barely escaping my lips. His eyes still open, still impossibly soft and warm even as the light slowly fades from them. Despite everything I just did to him, there is no trace of hatred in them. No fear. Only a haunting calm and an emotion I can't quite distinguish, which makes my stomach twist. He was my sun, the one thing I had that added color to my grey world, and now he was gone. He's nothing more than a lifeless body now that will soon decompose and turn into nutrients for soil. The night itself feels like it is holding its breath with me. I tell myself it had to be done, that people like him deserve to die, but it feels like I have carved my own heart open instead.

 The room is consumed with a haunting silence now, as if the walls themselves are mourning him. The faint echoes of the bustling city start to fade away, leaving me to feel the full weight of the actions I've just committed. Every inch of this room is a reminder of him. A piece of him. The way he hummed while painting. The way he would look up from writing and stare at me, as if I was the only real thing in his world. And now, it’s as though the room refuses to accept that he’s gone. I almost expect him to blink, to sigh, to call my name one last time. But the stillness in this room is absolute.

 It was never meant to end like this. We were never meant to part ways from each other. I used to laugh at the idea of tragedy. I used to think something as soul shattering as this could never befall me. How could love and ruin exist in the same breath? That's when I met him. The boy with paint-stained fingers and a crooked smile. The boy who could make all your despair disappear with just a single smile. I remember the first time we met, the way he looked up from his beat-up sketchbook. Our eyes met with a familiarity that felt wrong. “You look like someone who’s lost,” he said. Maybe I was. I never would have guessed the dark secrets that were hidden behind that gentle smile. I did not know that every word he wrote was a confession disguised as poetry, and every drawing created was him admitting to causing a tragedy. Back then I only saw the light in him. I only cared about how bright my world became. I could only ever see someone who listened in a way no one else ever had. That made me forget that where there is a bright, blazing sun, a darkness that consumes everything always follows. I should have been more guarded. I should've seen the lie hidden in that perfect, gentle smile.

 I wonder now if love blinds us because it wants to protect us, because it wants our world to crumble gently. As if knowing we aren't capable of feeling the full weight of losing something so precious.There were always questions I never asked, stories he stopped halfway through, nights he’d stare at his hands as if they weren’t his own. Maybe I never wanted the answers, that once I started asking questions the illusion of my blazing sun would fade away. That I would lose this overwhelmingly comforting warmth I obtained. Though if I had asked, perhaps I wouldn’t be standing here, in this room, with blood drying on my skin, wondering when our love turned into despair.

 Sometimes I think I fell in love with the sound of my own safety. He made me feel like I could stop running from myself. He made me forget that the world could collapse at any moment. The nights we spent with each other blur together now. The laughter we shared over empty coffee cups, his voice reading half finished stories aloud while I dozed off, the way he would look at me when he thought I wasn’t paying attention. But when you are standing directly in the rays of the blazing sun, it makes it difficult to notice the shadows, the hidden darkness that follows. There were moments, small and sharp, when something flickered behind his eyes. I noticed all the thoughts he did not share. All the moments of silence that lasted a few seconds too long. I should have known. How could I not have noticed anything? I should have seen all the blood that stained his hands. I should have noticed all the times his words did not match his eyes. Every time he forced a smile. All the scars that were hidden underneath his skin. All of the flickering, fiery, red signals I willfully ignored, just to keep the presence of my beautiful light pure.

 Now I've seen it all clearly. Too clearly. The moments that never made sense. The nights he visited smelling of metal and rain. The way he sketched faces in rushed anger only to tear it from his book before I could see. I remember how he’d shiver when sirens passed, how his laughter sometimes sounded like a cry. All of these memories that once blinded me with love now force me to see the truth. He was begging me to see him, and I refused.

 My eyes drift over the aftermath of what I've just done. A room once littered with joy and comfort, now is heavy with regret, the metallic tang of blood filling the air. I look around at the scene, at the once warm body that has yet to learn of its own death. I notice the cluttered desk and instinctively step towards it. Worn out notebooks and sketchbooks stacked in a careless perfection. The leather cracked, pages worn, and pages that have turned soft with age. I mindlessly reach for one, then another, as if being compelled by another force I could not name. At first glance, the sketches seem somewhat innocent. Faces. Movements. Smiles. But the more I look at the images, they start to shift. The smiles fade. The warmth in their eyes disappears. I have finally seen the depth of all the suffering he's caused. I started recognizing the faces, features, and expressions. Each drawing of a person I had seen plastered on the window of the cafe he and I would frequent. Each one correlated to a missing persons poster. Each person whose life was taken.

 My knees buckle as I keep turning the pages. The ink smudges beneath my trembling fingers. Some of the sketches are incomplete. Just eyes, mouths frozen mid scream, hands reaching out asking for help. Between the pages, faint stains of rust colored fingerprints. His fingerprints. He documented every sin, every life he forcibly took, as if he needed a reminder of what he had done.

 And the stories he wrote. Oh god, the writing… Lines that should've been sweet poetic poetry, confessions that were disguised as stories, notes that depict him slowly losing his soul. Each tale written ended with a quiet death. Someone surrendering. Begging for mercy. Each line written in blood red ink displayed the guilt he could never speak aloud. The world blurs together as my tears drip on the pages. The ink starts to bleed through. I can almost hear his voice reading the words out, soft and gentle, speaking of death as if it was something light. His handwriting trembles in some places, rushed in others, almost as if he was trying to run away from accounting the things he's done.

 These notebooks aren't just confessions. He was crafting eulogy for the person he used to be. Before death and sin consumed him. And now, here I am, left to finish his story. I stumbled back, my chest tight, breath hitched. Faces, words, confessions, all of his sins spread in these books as a gallery of horrors for me to see, beneath them all, a folded page. My name messily sprawled across it. My hands trembling, drenched in a cold sweat, stained with red.

 I hastily unfolded it.

 To you my only light,

If you are reading this, I could not bear to tell you the truth myself. The parts of me I tried so desperately to hide from you; however, how can our love last if all I do is lie? How can you trust me and love me when you can't see the depth of my sins. You always referred to me as your sun, you told me my soul was pure, yet everything I touch is always consumed with darkness. If I view myself as a monster, how could I not expect you to do the same? Your presence in my life is the only thing that made me wish so desperately I could be human. You made me believe in redemption, even if I do not deserve it. I wanted to be someone worthy. I wanted to change. But before I knew it, you started to catch on. There are too many words I couldn't find the courage to say. The way your laughter felt like sunlight on old wounds, the way I kept you close to feel alive again, to feel more human. You made me forget the monster I had become. I wanted to stop seeing the faces that haunted me at night. I wanted my hands to forget the feeling of life draining from someone. I wanted to feel as though my existence wasn't a sin. As if all the tragedy I bestowed on others was just a bad dream. That it wasn't me willingly committing these acts, but a force that took over my body. I so desperately craved forgiveness, but I knew that forgiveness was never mine to have in the first place. You were the first pure thing I've ever held in my bloodstained hands and even that I ruined. Every time I made you smile I thought, “maybe this is what freedom feels like.” Maybe this is what God meant when he created light. But the moment I was consumed with love for you, I knew I doomed us both. Sometimes letting go feels like drowning in silence. I cannot describe this eternal longing, only that it burns and blesses in the same breath. You became an ache in my soul that I was never capable of naming, you were both my punishment and lifelong prayer. I know it's cowardly to run from you after discovering my secret, but my heart cannot bear to see anything but love in your eyes for me. Please don't forgive me and please don't search for me. To the girl who taught me what it means to be human, goodbye.

 My tears dripped onto the page. The ink runs down it like veins. The words sprawled across the page felt fragile, raw, and alive. He loved me. Even though the darkness inside of him devoured others, he had seen me, and he wanted to protect me from himself. He tried to change… for me. No, he had changed for me. How cruel it is that the love I feel for him absolves even the unforgivable. But if he truly was trying to change, if he truly did feel despair for the horrendous acts he committed, what did that make me? A murderer? A hypocrite? Someone exactly like him? I became the very part of him that he was desperately repenting for, the rot beneath his charm, the sin that needed to be punished. Even if I believed I was the next victim, how do my actions differ from his?

 The air in this confined space seemed to thicken, the smell of rot prevalent. I looked around the room that had traces of him, oil paint that had yet to dry, and rainwater that leaked from the windowseal. His art was everywhere. Every painted face gazed at me, seeing all the things I never wanted to be, judging me for the irreversible sin I have committed. Their smiles eternal, their eyes filled with life that would never be seen from him again. He had written about the color I gave his world, how my voice was like a beautiful, soft spring after suffering in winter for a millennium. And now, the color and warmth he gave my world faded back to a black and white winter.

 I watch as the letter falls from my fingertips, landing on his bloodstained chest, as if trying to stitch our fates back together. I reach for him instinctively, trying to feel even just a fraction of his warmth. Trying to convince myself that he was still here. But to my dismay, none of the warmth I so desperately crave is left. The blade lay at my feet, half buried in my shadow. For a moment I thought I could put everything back, that maybe I was just stuck in a nightmare, that I could walk away as if none of it had happened. 

 I think back to that summer. The summer where we first met. The summer we were infinite. The sunlight danced on his face, and I remember thinking, “The world could never be cruel to someone as pure and warm as him.” He used to say, “Maybe if we never wake up, we can see the sun.” And I laughed, not knowing what he meant, not knowing every word he spoke was a plea for redemption, a realization he could never live a life without unforgivable sin.

 We spent that summer drifting between reality and something else I can't quite name. It was a peaceful, quiet place, where time seemed to stand still. He referred to this place as a Promised Neverland, a space where fleeting beauty felt eternal, a place where those who are broken could rest without worry, even just for a moment. Back then I could never fathom why he would need such a place, but now I fully understand. He was being haunted by his past, haunted by all the tragedies he caused, and now the same is happening to me. Even that infinite feeling summer we shared together, that summer that was a sanctuary of light and laughter, was doomed to fade. And now, looking at him, I've come to realize, nothing ends the same way it begins.

 The night is eerily silent now, a kind of quiet that is mocking the chaos happening in my heart. Maybe this is how the sun feels just before disappearing into the horizon, a last burst of a beautifully brilliant warmth. How could the world be so still while a tragedy is befalling me? Now I am left with a devastating truth. I killed the only person who made my life worth living. Even if he was a murderer. Even if he considered himself a monster. After all, monsters can feel love too. Monsters can desperately seek forgiveness, they can try to repent.

 I reach for him again and press on his wound. His blood already dry, but it feels like it's still flowing. From him into me. For a brief moment I pretend he's just resting. That I can still hear the sound of his breaths. Regret is so painful. Too painful.

 This room, once used as our sacred haven, has started to come to life. The walls whisper the sweet memories we shared. Our laughter lingers in here, taking away every breath I manage to gasp out. I can hear the echo of his voice softly whispering my name the way he used to when the world grew too loud. Too overwhelming.

My heart aches with the cruel realization that the world does not mourn with us. The stars still shine. The city still moves. The world will not stop just because my universe shattered. Just because the only thing that gave me purpose has disappeared. The world will continue as if this moment does not exist. But here, in this room, time stands still, love and ruin frozen together in their final breath. 

My fingers clasp around the cold blade, once again. I tell myself I cannot bear to live with the weight of this sin. That I cannot live a life without him. How am I supposed to go back to a world of grey when I've seen colors so vibrant they burned. I fought so hard not to become another victim, to carve my own path away from all of the horrors he committed. I convinced myself that ending him meant I had taken back control, that I had survived all the things he's done. 

But survival, it seems, was not written for me to claim. Killing him only made me become the final piece of his story. His final masterpiece. The ending he could never achieve himself. The color he bestowed upon my world is fading now, slowly bleeding out of me. I start to feel weak, the room starts spinning, and the only thought that can cross my mind is how everything he left behind, his words, his art, his darkness, has now become my everything. 

The girl lays motionless beside her lover's body. The world outside continues, unaware that something sacred has just ended. The window of the room is still slightly ajar. A breeze slips through the crack, carrying the faint scent of lilacs, a flower often used to symbolize first love. 

No one would see her eyes, distant, cold, and finally closed. The letter addressed to her lay beneath her fingertips, the page stained with the last of her tears. The only sound echoing in the room, the faint sound of a heartbeat slowing, finally stopped.",2,1766325191.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

in chicago i had 10 years of relationships. people i could grab coffee with, former colleagues who would refer me for roles, industry contacts who kept me in the loop on whats happening. moved to austin and suddenly i had... my partner and our realtor.

spent 6 months trying different approaches to rebuild my network. some worked, most didnt. sharing what i learned.

---

**what didnt work: linkedin cold outreach**

my first instinct was to just start messaging people on linkedin. ""hey i just moved to austin, would love to connect and learn about the marketing scene here.""

sent probably 50 of these messages. got maybe 5 responses, 2 actual coffee meetings, and both of those were awkward because we had nothing in common besides being marketers in the same city. one guy spent 45 minutes trying to recruit me into his mlm side hustle.

the problem with linkedin cold outreach is theres no signal for who would actually be a good connection. youre just guessing based on job titles and hoping for the best. most people ignore cold messages anyway, and the ones who respond arent necessarily the ones youd actually want to know.

---

**what didnt work: networking events**

austin has tons of marketing meetups and tech events. i went to probably 15 of them between april and july.

the format is always the same. you show up, theres awkward mingling, you exchange business cards with random people, maybe you have one decent conversation, then you go home and never follow up because you dont remember who was who.

i collected maybe 100 business cards over those months. actually stayed in touch with 2 people. thats a 2% conversion rate for hours of uncomfortable small talk.

the events that worked slightly better were smaller and more focused. a dinner for 12 people in b2b saas marketing was way more valuable than a 200 person ""austin marketers"" happy hour. but finding those smaller events is hard and they dont happen often.

---

**what kinda worked: warm intros through existing network**

i asked my chicago contacts if they knew anyone in austin. this was more effective than cold outreach because theres social proof built in. ""hey my friend sarah is moving to austin, you two should connect"" is a much better opener than a random linkedin message.

got maybe 10 intros this way and most of them turned into real connections. the problem is this approach doesnt scale. i burned through my chicago networks austin connections pretty quickly. and it only works in directions your existing network already extends, which for me didnt include the startup scene i wanted to get into.

---

**what actually worked: walnut**

ok so this is the thing that actually changed the game for me and why im writing this post.

a friend recommended walnut after i complained about how hard networking was going. its an ai platform that builds what they call a ""digital twin"" of your professional self. sounded gimmicky at first but i was frustrated enough to try it.

the setup takes maybe 30 minutes. you connect your linkedin, upload your resume, answer some questions about your goals and what youre looking for. it analyzes your background and builds an ai model of who you are professionally, your skills, experience, industries you understand, types of problems youve solved, communication style, etc.

then it uses that model to match you with people. not just ""you both work in marketing"" matching, but actually thoughtful connections based on complementary backgrounds, shared interests, potential mutual value.

the first match it suggested was a vp of marketing at a series b fintech in austin. the reasoning it gave was that my experience doing integrated campaigns at a regulated financial services company in chicago would be relevant to challenges shes facing with compliance-approved content. thats a connection i never would have found on linkedin because i wouldnt have searched for fintech specifically, and she wouldnt have searched for someone from traditional finance.

we had coffee and it was immediately useful for both of us. she had questions about how larger companies handle marketing compliance, i had questions about the austin startup scene. weve stayed in touch and she introduced me to three other people in her network.

---

**how the matching actually works**

what makes walnut different from linkedin is the depth of the matching. linkedin knows your job title and company. walnut understands the actual substance of what youve done.

from my profile it understood that i have experience with:
- marketing in regulated industries (financial services)
- integrated campaigns across digital and traditional channels
- building teams from scratch (grew chicago team from 2 to 15)
- working with enterprise sales cycles
- navigating corporate bureaucracy

so when it suggests connections its not just ""heres another marketing person."" its ""heres someone who needs the specific type of expertise you have"" or ""heres someone whose experience could help you with challenges youve mentioned.""

over 4 months walnut introduced me to maybe 25 people. of those, i had meaningful conversations with about 20. thats an 80% hit rate compared to 2% from networking events and maybe 4% from linkedin cold outreach.

more importantly the conversations were actually good. because theres real context for why were meeting, we skip the awkward ""so what do you do"" small talk and get into actually useful discussion.

---

**the digital twin stuff**

walnut has features where the ai can act on your behalf. like it can reach out to potential connections, respond to messages, schedule meetings. i turned most of that off because i prefer to control my own outreach.

but theres one feature i do use which is the opportunity surfacing. it scans for jobs, projects, speaking opportunities, etc that match your profile and flags them. found out about a marketing leadership role at an austin saas company this way before it was publicly posted. didnt end up pursuing it but good to know whats out there.

theres also something where it can prepare you for conversations. before a meeting it gives you background on the person and suggests talking points based on what you might have in common or where you might be helpful to each other. kind of like a cheat sheet for networking.

---

**where im at now**

moved to austin in march. by october i had a solid local network. not as deep as 10 years in chicago obviously, but enough that i feel connected to whats happening professionally in this city.

specific outcomes:
- regular coffee/lunch rotation with maybe 8 local marketing people
- got invited to join a small cmo dinner group (the kind of thing you only hear about through relationships)
- two consulting projects that came through network referrals
- strong enough local presence that when i eventually look for my next role ill have warm paths into austin companies

also just feels better psychologically. the first few months after moving i felt professionally isolated even though i still had my job. now i feel like i have a community here.

---

**honest limitations**

walnut isnt magic. a few things to know:

the quality of matches depends on how much you put in. if you just connect linkedin and dont answer the goal questions or provide context on what youre looking for, the matches will be generic. garbage in garbage out.

it works better in certain cities and industries. austin and sf have lots of users. if youre in a smaller city or niche industry there might not be enough people to match with.

theres a bit of a chicken and egg problem. the matching is only as good as who else is on the platform. but that seems to be improving as more people join.

and some people are going to be uncomfortable with the ai-acting-on-your-behalf features. i get it. i turned most of them off too. but you can use just the matching and discovery features without any of the autonomous stuff.

---

**tldr**

if youre rebuilding a network from scratch, whether from relocation, career change, or just not having invested in relationships earlier in your career:

1. linkedin cold outreach has terrible conversion rates
2. big networking events are mostly a waste of time
3. warm intros through existing contacts work but dont scale
4. walnut (or similar ai-powered matching) actually works because it matches on substance not surface level job titles

took me 6 months and a lot of awkward coffee meetings to figure this out. hope this saves someone else the trouble.

1ps6y36,https://i.redd.it/sotfwjlzak8g1.jpeg,KANADE CHAPTER 3 MINI ANALYSIS IS FINALLY HERE!,"Some notes:

This is my first analysis and it’s a small one, so tell me if there’s anything I should improve on. I looked at a few videos to refresh my memories and this video in particular helped me out, so credits to them:
https://youtu.be/0rlSst3IVVQ?si=-kxWqOamlek-bmEl

Kanade is operating within a fixed system, the killing game, so her scheme required a lot of complexity thinking (which is further convoluted due to the people actually in her trial. Them being, Hibiki, Sora, Syobai, Mikado, Yuki, Iroha, Nikei, Teruya, Yoruko and Shinji)

Kanade was extremely cautious the entire plan through, her plan was extremely convoluted. She most definitely thought over about her plan decompositionally. There are several different moving parts (a total of 23 tactics with contingencies and adaption) to create her strategy, breaking them down into smaller singular moves to keep track and have control over her strategy.

Although she was planning the double culprit as the killing game started, her plans relied upon her setting (strategy logistics + logical manipulation). One thing that’s important to note is that the cast arrived at the third island and meanwhile Kanade was orchestrating her strategy, which i believe took 3 days. This was also to further stalk Iroha and learn her routine to drug her. 

She also adapted her plan for the new setting (planning acclimation, strategy flexibility, strategy logistics, strategy complexity, PSI, FRI, fluid intelligence)

Chapter 3 strategy analysis:

Kanade has 3 plans:
- Firstly frame Hibiki
- Secondly frame Iroha
- Lastly, confess herself as the culprit 
(Planning aim + intricacies + acclimation + recovery + coverage + contingencies)

Kanade implementing her plans is extremely stressful for her and requires multiple singular tactics to develop strategies that are resilient and have to be aligned. This entire chapter portrays mental fortitude, stress tolerance, multi-tasking, discipline and emotional engagement. 

To prevent Iroha from having any alibis in the afternoon, she drugs her coffee. However, Sora drank it instead. (First instance of divine luck). First tactic. (Logical manipulation, concealment, acting skills, EU, planning intricacies, strategy orchestration)

Kanade then texts setsuka to come to the pool area. Setsuka arrives at the pool while Kanade was hiding inside. Kanade chooses her because Setsuka was close to Hibiki and threatened Kanade’s complete control over Hibiki. Killing her would further psychologically damage her sister. Second tactic. (Psychological warfare, demoralisation, emotional manipulation, decision making, EU, EE, EP, EF, inter emotional management, perception, observation, VCI, strategy logistics, strategy orchestration)

The pool records are currently displayed as:
8:44am | (Kanade)- IN
8:45am | (Setsuka) - IN

Remember that entries and exits are anonymous, i’m just stating the names to cover any confusion. 

She deduced that she can creatively and logically manipulate the logs. (Deductive reasoning.)

Rules: A person has to enter an ‘attraction’ with their handbook.
Whenever used the first time, the system registers it as ‘IN’. If the same handbook is used again, it is registered as ‘OUT’
The handbook’s owner name is anonymous 
You don’t necessarily have to use your handbook
A lot of her VCI, misdirection, strategy shielding and concealment feats in this chapter is due to constant exploitation of this specific deduction. 

As soon as Setsuka enters the pool, she’s knocked unconscious by the taser. Putting blood packs all over her to make it seem like she was dead. Third tactic. (Fabrication, acting skills, EE, EF, concealment, emotional + logical manipulation, demoralisation, psychological warfare)

Kanade steals Setsuka’s handbook and texts Hibiki to come to the pool, Kanade gives Hibiki her own handbook to enter into the pool. Fourth tactic. (VCI, FRI, strategy logistics) 

Hibiki saw Setsuka’s ‘dead’ body and this breaks her. Fifth tactic. (Psychological warfare, emotional manipulation, logical manipulation, VCI, EE, EU, EF, EP, inter emotional management, foresight scope, concealment, acting skills, fabrication).

The pool records are currently displayed as:
8:44am | (Kanade)- IN
8:45am | (Setsuka) - IN
9:22am | (Kanade) - OUT {actually Hibiki entering}

It states that the first anonymous person leaves the pool through the records, but this is actually Hibiki going inside the pool. Therefore, Hibiki, Kanade and Setsuka are all in the pool, whilst it displays that the second person is only at the pool through the logs. (Logical manipulation, concealment, strategy orchestration, VCI, FRI, fabrication/falsification, misdirection) 

Kanade and Hibiki both stab Setsuka’s torso simultaneously, in perfect synchronisation to make themselves the culprits. (Hibiki is manipulated by Kanade.) Sixth tactic (Perception, PSI, strategy complexity, strategy logistics, decision making, setting up traps, EU, EE, inter + intra emotional management, abstract reasoning). The reason why it’s intra emotional management is because of handling the extremely stressful situation of synchronising herself with hibiki, although she can do this, the stress of messing it up is still heavy as the entire strategy falls apart if this isn’t completed properly. (She does have the contingency in place, but it would still be preferable and more efficient to get it right the first time). The entire strategy pivots at this vital tactic. 

Kanade also brought a medkit (specifically antibiotics) just in case Setsuka didn’t die properly, (to heal her and then try again). This antibiotic bottle dropped which was the next instance of divine luck. Contingency. 
(Planning contingency, cautiousness, critical thinking, abductive reasoning, planning coverage, strategy shielding, planning intricacies, decision making, intra + inter EM, EF). 

Kanade then uses Setsuka’s handbook to leave the pool so she can get the tools for the dismemberment process. The logs display that Setsuka left the pool. 

The pool records are currently displayed as:
8:44am | (Kanade)- IN
8:45am | (Setsuka) - IN
9:22am | (Kanade) - OUT {actually Hibiki entering}
9:54am | (Setsuka) - OUT {actually kanade}

Note that Kanade uses Setsuka’s handbook to exit the pool, but it manipulates the log to make it seem that both people who entered the pool at 8:44am and 8:45am left individually at 9:22am and 9:54am. When in actuality, Kanade leaves the pool, and Setsuka’s dead body and Hibiki in her manipulated state is still inside the pool. Seventh tactic. (VCI, FRI, Concealment, fabrication/falsification, misdirection, logical manipulation, strategy complexity, strategy logistics, planning coverage, EE, EF, strategy alignment)

Kanade returns with her tools within 3 hours. She assumed Iroha was drugged, therefore allowing her to frame Iroha due to her lack of alibi. 

The pool records are currently displayed as:
8:44am | (Kanade)- IN
8:45am | (Setsuka) - IN
9:22am | (Kanade) - OUT {actually Hibiki entering}
9:54am | (Setsuka) - OUT {actually kanade}
12:54pm | (Kanade) - IN

Hibiki leaves a sign outside the pool to deter anyone from entering. This simple singular move is entirely logical and makes the others believe that there is some sort of technical/maintenance issue with the pool, therefore they wouldn’t enter it. It’s also due to their fear of breaking the rule, that perhaps monocrow/mikado would punish them. It entirely castles Hibiki and Kanade to dismember Setsuka’s body. Eighth tactic. (VCI, FRI, EU, EF, concealment, logical manipulation, fabrication/falsification, misdirection, strategy alignment, strategy shielding, planning coverage, observation, perception, indirect manipulation)

Kanade dismembers Setsuka’s body into pieces so it can be transported, this process took 5 hours. Nineth tactic. (Strategy alignment, EE, stress tolerance, mental fortitude)

Kanade hides Setsuka’s torso due to the stab marks revealing that the killer’s dominant hand (since Kanade is left handed). This would damper her plan. Note that Kanade considered this, which is why she targeted Iroha and stalked her, as only herself and Iroha were left handed. Furthermore, the stab marks also display that there were two killers, which the entire strategy relied upon. Tenth tactic. (Strategy shielding, planning coverage, planning contingencies, strategy alignment, critical thinking, abstract reasoning)

Hibiki disguised herself as Kanade, using Setsuka’s hands to alter her appearance (body shape) and to have constant access to Setsuka’s handbook. What’s important to note here is that Hibiki is simply following orders from Kanade. Kanade’s project on Hibiki was going on for several years, developing her into a puppet. Part of her plan was to decoy herself so it looked as if she had an alibi, which obviously worked. Kanade had to know herself, what she is, her emotional state, behaviours, how she acts, how she looks like etc. and this was developed into Hibiki for several years. This displays an immense amount of emotional realisation, recognising her own emotional and behavioural states to indirectly deceive everyone into believing she was present at the parade. Eleventh tactic. 

The pool records are currently displayed as:
8:44am | (Kanade)- IN
8:45am | (Setsuka) - IN
9:22am | (Kanade) - OUT {actually Hibiki entering}
9:54am | (Setsuka) - OUT {actually kanade}
12:54pm | (Kanade) - IN
17:24pm | (Hibiki) - IN
17:25pm | (Kanade) - OUT

Hibiki (manipulated by Kanade) uses Setsuka’s handbook to text Iroha and tells her to come near the Haunted Mansion at 18:00pm. Because this would prevent Iroha from going to the parade and this will prevent any alibi she will have for the evening - making her more suspicious. It’s important to note that Kanade currently assumes that Iroha was drugged for the entire day, although she wasn’t drugged and instead Sora was drugged, this singular move would’ve strengthened her original tactic, but because of this plan failing, this specific tactic wasn’t as effective, but her meticulous planning, this singular move was fortified. Twelfth tactic. (Strategy alignment, strategy shielding, EF, EU, logical manipulation, indirect manipulation, perception) 

Hibiki (disguised as Kanade) removes the pool sign and goes to department A. Hibiki removes her disguise and enters the haunted mansion so Iroha would see Hibiki. This is done so Iroha would tell everyone that she saw Hibiki enter the ghost house and it will make Iroha herself look suspicious. And make it seem like Iroha is trying to frame Hibiki because there was seemingly no evidence that Hibiki entered the mansion. Thirteenth tactic (Indirect manipulation, logical manipulation, strategy complexity, strategy alignment, strategy shielding, EF, EU, EP)

Hibiki enters the ghost mansion with Setsuka’s handbook. This is to conceal the time and location of Setsuka’s death, to make it seem that Setsuka entered the mansion and got killed with no ‘out’ record. Hibiki would leave the mansion with her own handbook to manipulate the logs into displaying 2 ‘in’ records. Obviously, this was devised by kanade. Fourteenth tactic. 

The haunted house records are currently displayed as:
17:55pm | (Setsuka) - IN {actually Hibiki}
17:57pm | (Hibiki) - IN {Hibiki exiting the haunted mansion}

(Strategy alignment, strategy complexity, VCI, FRI, planning coverage, planning intricacies, logical manipulation, indirect manipulation, abductive reasoning, concealment, misdirection, fabrication/falsification)

Hibiki cut the wires to the fuse box to diffuse all the lights in the mansion, and later put out the fire in the fireplace. The blackout was done to reduce vision for anyone else coming into the mansion. This was to put more suspicion on Iroha, as she was near the mansion when this happened. One thing to note is that Hibiki caused the black out in two minutes, this suggests that Kanade had previously mapped out and definitely visualised the haunted mansion and where the fireplace + fusebox would be located. Making it easier and more efficient for Hibiki as she would’ve told her the locations of the light sources. This would’ve been part of her preparation process before implementing her strategy. Fifthteenth tactic. (Logical + indirect manipulation, concealment, strategy complexity, strategy logistics, strategy alignment, strategy shielding, planning coverage, planning intricacies, perception, VSI, observation, VCI, misdirection, fabrication/falsification).

Hibiki, disguised as Kanade, met up with everyone else to make it seem that Kanade has an alibi. This was another creative trap set up by Kanade. 16th tactic. (Logical manipulation, fabrication, strategy alignment + complexity, social awareness, setting up traps)

Note that Kanade had planned this entire thing out extremely intricately, down to the specific timings. Because as Hibiki met up with the others, the real Kanade was implementing the next strategy at 6pm. The same time where Hibiki met with the others. Completely concealing the next stages of her strategy. Kanade stuffed Setsuka’s chest in one of the parade dolls that travelled from department C to A because the chest was too large to fit in the chimney. Kanade would’ve visualised the size of the chimney and concluded that it wouldn’t fit Setsuka’s chest, opting for another route to retrieve Setsuka’s chest, in which was an extremely clever and creative manner. Sure, later on the class would’ve found out about this during the trial, but retrospectively this was obviously at the work of divine luck. The concealment of the body part and transportation of it was way too innovate and out of the box for anyone without divine luck to think about. It really displays Kanade’s creativity throughout her strategy, which stems from the accumulated knowledge from her previous 50-60 murders. She utilised her setting extremely well, and was aware of several approaches that she could’ve done. She transports the body parts divergently through different means that were castled and protected due to her fake alibis. 17th tactic. (Strategy logistics + alignment + complexity + resilience + shielding, planning intricacies + coverage + acclimation, divergent + critical + holistic thinking, abductive + abstract reasoning, concealment, FRI, EE, EF, crystallised intelligence, fluid intelligence, VSI, FRI)

At 6:10pm, she gets on the monorail and throws the body pieces successfully (due to her pitcher talent) from above, into the chimney of the ghost house. The ghost house was in the monorail route between C and A. She uses the monorail timetable to her advantage so she can throw 7 body parts down the chimney instead of 4. The monorail passes C-A only 4 times per hour. There are two trains going in both directions. Kanade gets on the second train at 6:10pm and throws one body part between C-A. Then she gets off at stop A from train 2, from that stop she takes the first train to go in the opposite direction at 6:20pm. She goes back through the A-C route and throws another body part. She gets off the first train at C to take the second train from the same stop. This process repeats until she throws all 7 body parts using both trains in an inter exchangeable manner. The aim of this section of her strategy was to pass through the C-A route as much as possible. (There are only 3 stops). This entire 18th tactic is severely underrated for some odd reason and glossed over. This entire process is rigorous and a huge physical burden, coupled with the fact that Kanade is transporting body parts. Of course, she’s done similar before, but this was extremely stressful because even 1 miss (out of her 7 attempts) would mess up her entire strategy’s progress. The sheer timing and repetitiveness definitely wore Kanade down in some way. It’s a very clever exploitation of her surroundings and was able to conceal all 7 body parts successfully due to her out of the box thinking. She also obviously had to visualise the precise points to throw each body part (including the weight, height, force etc.) and this was the first time she was doing anything like this. She had to be successful no matter what, so she had to calculate the necessary calculations to actually throw each body part, mind you off a literal moving vehicle into a small hole (considering it couldn’t fit Setsuka’s chest which is 90cm). I would imagine she did the calculations beforehand, but even then it’s extremely impressive considering the stakes and how she did this the first time (which is aided by her talent but doesn’t take away the merit). Also the fact that she recognised her own strengths and utilised her dart throwing ability to her advantage displays her intrapersonal emotional and physical awareness. 18th tactic. (Strategy complexity + alignment, PSI, learning ability, FRI, VSI, WMI due to memorising the monorail timetable and the quickest route to maintain A-C/C-A, EE, ER, perception, observation, intra EM, mental fortitude, stress tolerance, planning coverage, planning intricacies, crystallised + fluid intelligence, critical + convergent + decompositional thinking, abstract reasoning)

It’s important to note how much effort, physical and mental toil, Kanade put in her plan, it took 3 days to plan it out fully, and an entire day executing it, whilst maintaining her composure during the class trial. Insane amounts of intra EM, EE, mental fortitude, stress tolerance and strategy alignment. 

Kanade then goes to the storehouse in department A where the parade dolls had arrived from department C to retrieve Setsuka’s chest from the doll. Meanwhile, everyone else started to search for Setsuka, Hibiki (disguised as Kanade) went to search in department A. Hibiki removes her disguise here. Kanade obviously predicted that everyone by the time of the parade’s finish would start to panic due to Setsuka’s absence, so she planned that Hibiki would ""search"" for Setsuka, whilst in actuality she would be progressing her strategy further. The blackout was to divert Sora’s attention. 19th tactic. (Strategy alignment + logistics, concealment, foresight scope + horizon, logical manipulation, planning coverage, misdirection)

Kanade hides behind the haunted mansion and waits until Sora leaves, so she can signal Hibiki to carry Setsuka’s chest from the storehouse to the mansion. The body parts that Kanade threw from the monorail and into the chimney of the mansion, had landed on the fireplace. But Sora didn’t see them because the area was dark due to the blackout. 20th tactic. This is simply Kanade’s strategy progressing, so strategy alignment can be awarded here. 

Hibiki enters the mansion by scanning Setsuka’s handbook with the hands disguised as her chest (to alter her body appearance to match Kanade’s). Therefore Hibiki herself doesn’t have an out record but it doesn’t matter since the logs don’t reveal that information. So once again the logs are manipulated. All it shows that 3 people entered the mansion that day and only 2 of them left, although Hibiki and Sora only actually ever went to the mansion, it fabricates the murder location to make it seem that Setsuka was murdered in the mansion.

The haunted house records are currently displayed as:
17:55pm | (Setsuka) - IN {actually Hibiki}
17:57pm | (Hibiki) - IN {Hibiki exiting the haunted mansion}
19:24pm | (Sora) - IN 
19:36pm | (Sora) - OUT
19:42pm | Hibiki - OUT {Hibiki actually entering}

(VCI, logical + indirect manipulation, concealment, misdirection, fabrication/falsification, strategy logistics + alignment, strategy complexity, planning coverage)

Hibiki places the body parts from the fireplace and on the altar (including the chest and the hands in her possession) and brought the blood packs that kanade stole and splattered them all over the floor. It’s important to note that Hibiki is still in her puppet state, and she placed the body parts in the dark. Kanade obviously planned this and would’ve told Hibiki where to place the different body parts due to the lack of light. 21st tactic. (VSI, FRI, fabrication, strategy alignment, perception, EF) 

Hibiki drops her hairpins near the ‘crime scene’ so Kanade can strengthen and shield her strategy just in case of her original plan failing of framing Iroha, she can frame Hibiki instead since it would make logical sense that Hibiki in a traumatic state would become desperate, as thats what her personality before suggested. 22nd tactic. (Strategy alignment, planning intricacies, logical manipulation, sophistry, strategy orchestration, misdirection, strategy shielding)

Hibiki uses Setsuka’s handbook to lure everyone to the fabricated crime scene, as she hides behind the folding screen. Then Hibiki pretends to arrive alongside everyone else to discover the body, and Kanade snaps her out of her trance state. Kanade’s strategy relied on many pivotal parts, such as throwing the body parts into the chimney and the double culprit synchronisation, however it’s crucial to consider her manipulation and exploitation of Hibiki, as without Hibiki, Kanade wouldn’t be able to execute her double culprit plan. Hibiki’s memories of what she’s done is completely erased and Kanade only knows the entire truth, this further shields her plan as there would be a high chance of Hibiki confessing to the double murder if she had retained her memories. Kanade is in complete control over the narrative and has several avenues of sophistry and logical manipulation throughout the trial, marking as several contingencies. 23rd tactic. (Information control, strategy logistics, strategy complexity, strategy alignment, strategy shielding, planning intricacies + coverage + contingencies, concealment, misdirection, emotional manipulation, EE, EF, EU, EM, acting skills for Kanade acting as if she wasn’t involved, and it’s very impressive to note that no-one suspected her due to her appearance from the fatigue of actually executing her plan, so that would also be crystallised intelligence due to the prior experience of orchestrating complex murders.) 

The first half of her strategy is extremely complex and revolves around 3 major points. Exploiting Hibiki’s puppet state, the double culprit trick and the transportation of the body parts. There were (from what I revised) 23 tactics that all had to be harmonious to complete her strategy, which boosts her strategy alignment considering the fatigue, mental fortitude and emotional management due to the stress, and her emotional engagement with the actual strategy itself. She was very cautious and meticulous in her planning, predicting the others actions well ahead and using her environment to her advantage. The fabrication/falsifications of the log systems is very impressive considering how versatile it is (including the versatility of other tactics), as she would use them to frame Iroha/Hibiki. She had a deep understanding of what she was doing and all the moving parts, she had good social integration within the actual class due to their dependence on her from the first and second trials. She has good social awareness due to her gauging Setsuka’s influence upon the group as a whole (and on her sister). This plan required a ton of thinking + reasoning, especially an expanded perspective. 

During the trial:

Every plan was executed and set in motion, Kanade would firstly frame Hibiki with the evidence. Stating that it wouldn’t be illogical due to Hibiki’s deteriorated mental state. That Hibiki would do something just as desperate as murdering Setsuka, utilising the ghost house to further push her ‘sound’ reasoning of the motive behind the crime. This trial up until this point has been extremely short, and this was due to Kanade’s preparations. She already built enough influence and lead her class twice before in each class trial, so she is trustworthy by this point to vote out Hibiki as the perpetrator. They would be partially correct, but would ultimately lose the trial anyway due to the trick. However, syobai finally intervened. But of course, Kanade expected Syobai intervening and correctly predicted all of his arguments beforehand, giving her much stronger refutations and better premises. It’s specific to note that Kanade has extremely good intra EM throughout the trial, although as mentioned before for other reasons, Kanade is arguably in an extremely advantageous position (if there was no divine luck involved) due to her information control and directing the narrative. But despite that, she doesn’t get too cocky/arrogant and pushes on to finish the class trial. Another thing to recognise is Kanade’s cognitive decoupling. Kanade whilst constructing her plan, obviously foresaw all of Syobai’s arguments and the direction that the class trial would go in. Kanade cognitively decoupled herself, detached herself, and saw herself through the others and mostly Syobai’s perspectives. She then pieced together her own case, solving it and finding points of interest that would arise suspicion or give a clue, so that she can later refine her arguments to cover them up. I’m sure this is another feat that most people don’t even realise, but it buffs Kanade exponentially in several categories, mostly EP, EU, perception, strategy shielding, sophistry, all thinking categories + all logical reasoning categories. Her case is extremely complex and requires an insane amount of deductive, inductive, abductive and abstract reasoning skills. 

(EF, EP, EU, Intra EM, Inter EM, foresight scope and horizon, logical manipulation, indirect manipulation due to her reputation, leadership, influence building, sophistry, concealment, information control, FRI, creativity, VCI due to the constructed arguments and refutations, psychological warfare due to the demoralising feelings the class went through of trying to solve the case but being unable to do so, social awareness, planning intricacies + coverage, strategy resilience, mass manipulation, acting skills due to this phase of the trial revolving around her creating logical theories to solve the case, critical + complexity + holistic + convergent + divergent + decompositional thinking, deductive + inductive + abductive + abstract reasoning, crystallised + fluid intelligence, cold reading, situational adaptability, environmental adaptability due to adapting her original plan to consider and utilise the resources of her environment, decision making, caution, demoralisation, psychological warfare)

After her plan of pinning the murder onto Hibiki failing, and refuting Syobai’s accusation, she utilised the deadlock to propose that Iroha would be the murderer. As it would match up and recognise Syobai’s original arguments. That the killer is left handed, which only applies to Kanade and Iroha. Kanade had already defended herself and directed the narrative into pressuring Iroha into a confession. She already foresaw Iroha being unable to properly defend herself, which gave her more credibility in her theories and generally increase the suspicion on Iroha. Furthermore, Iroha could be blamed for the suspicion previously mounted onto Hibiki as Iroha was situationally manipulated and confirmed to be by herself the entire day, other than seeing Hibiki. Kanade predicted this through pattern recognition, abductive reasoning and EU, understanding Iroha’s behaviours and her inability to defend herself. It’s a very good strategy due to her adaption from blaming Hibiki to blaming Iroha, validating Syobai aswell. (EP, EU, EF, logical + indirect + mass manipulation, social awareness, strategy shielding + flexibility, planning acclimation + coverage + intricacies, situational adaptability, sophistry, misdirection, acting skills, perception, observation, FRI, VCI, fluid intelligence, critical thinking, abductive reasoning, information control, psychological warfare, demoralisation)

This strategy only failed due to the intervention of divine luck, specifically Mikado stating that he saw Iroha painting, giving her an alibi. 

Kanade’s concealment of the transportation of the body parts is extremely creative as mentioned before, making Sora and Syobai stumped. There were various logical inconsistencies for Syobai’s theories of how the body was transported (via the monorail and chimney) that Kanade pointed out. It’s interesting to note *how* Kanade refuted the arguments. Although logically it made sense (reinforced by her reputation of being logical and correct throughout the first two trials) she was starting to crash out. But this for some reason is always interpreted as “KaNaDe hAs sHiT eM” no, you just don’t know how to comprehend the media. This was a strategic move that Kanade done to direct suspicion onto her. Her previous strategies failed, but even those failures are successful due to it aiding the next strategy. Accusing Hibiki -> Fails -> Aids her to accuse Iroha. Accusing Iroha -> Fails -> Aids her to direct the suspicion onto herself. Another thing to note about Kanade’s Intra EM, and this applies to other high/top tier characters aswell, EM ‘anti-feats’ don’t even matter that much. Kanade is believed to have bad Intra-EM (which she doesn’t, I’ll touch upon this later). Character’s are always going to crash out, it’s literally just normal human behaviour, what matters is when they actually crash out. Yuuichi has good Intra-EM, but when he was referred to as ‘Yuuichi Shiba’ by Tsukino, Yuuichi grabbed her hand and stated seriously to ‘not call me by that name’. This wasn’t a major anti-feat because of the minimal consequences that followed. Or Light Yagami falling for the Lind L Taylor trap (I’m probably going to make a separate post of this bc many people are mistaken that this is an intra-EM anti-feat), sure the consequences was that L was able to confirm his deductions, but it wasn’t detrimental to Light. Light Yagami, holistically and retrospectively, had no reason to suspect the broadcast, and it was simply a really good feat by L to exploit Kira’s emotional state. Anyways, there are only small ‘anti-feats’ for Kanade (which are explanable) in intra-EM, but is outside of ch3. (Creativity, critical thinking, divergent thinking, strategy alignment, strategy flexibility, situational + social + cognitive adaptability, FRI, VCI due to refutations, PSI due to processing of Syobai’s arguments and quickly refuting them, foresight scope + prediction, EP, EU, Intra-EM, EF, Inter-EM, EE, planning intricacies + coverage + acclimation + recovery, all cats logical reasoning, concealment, misdirection, acting skills due to acting like she was being cornered, sophistry, cunningness, perception, observation, social integration, leadership, influence building, social awareness, all categories manipulation, unpredictability, psychological warfare, demoralisation, judgement, decision making)

So, Kanade helps lead the entire class to the actual culprit of the case, herself, and indirectly makes Sora deduce that Kanade is the culprit due to her ultimate pitcher talent. It logically makes sense after Sora’s deduction, and this directs the suspicion onto Kanade, which was aided by her previous strategies failing. It’s very interesting to note that Kanade strategically puppeteer and manipulated the entire trial and the narrative, the trial’s complexity was extremely rigorous and gruelling, which pushed everyone to think. Even Mikado was actually providing helpful insights. It’s not that the people in the trial were necessarily dumb, but rather disadvantaged due to Kanade’s better premises. There are 10 people actively against her, and they are still manipulated to firstly dissect Kanade’s strategy of framing Hibiki, then dissect her strategy of framing Iroha. She strategically accused herself last because she knew the exhaustion of the trial (further pushed by the extreme amounts of stress) would cause misjudgements within the class, making them vote her out as the sole culprit, which was her plan. (EP, EU, EF, all cats manipulation, information control, all cats deception except for bluffing, perception, observation, psychological warfare, all cats thinking, all cats reasoning, general adaptability, foresight scope + horizon, social awareness, leadership, influence building)

But of course, Sora had intervened again, due to her intuition (divine luck) and solved the final piece of the puzzle. Aided by Syobai’s theory of the double culprit due to abdominal area being missing. Further reinforced by the medicine bottle. 

The fact that Kanade’s strategies held up even against several instances of divine luck genuinely portrays how invincible, intricate and intelligent Kanade is. And of course, her strategies were curated under the guise of previously assuming that she was in a somewhat realistic reality (however she would deduct that she’s in a simulation later on), and had no idea of a literal divine force against her. And this divine force had to intervene several times throughout her plan just to BARELY overturn her, she lost only ever barely, and it was down to literal luck. This incredibly boosts all of her categories, especially planning, strategy and trap evasion. 

“We’re not sure how the culprit didn’t notice this, but it was this single bottle that allowed us to prove the double blackened theory” - Sora. 

This demonstrates that it was uncharacteristic for Kanade, who has gotten away with complex murder schemes over 60 times, who curated an extremely intricate, cautious and convoluted plan would gloss over something so big. It was also the only time Kanade actually lost her cool (not an intra EM antifeat) since it was impossible for her to mess up like that. There were various instances of divine luck at play, and even against these odds Kanade’s strategy’s resilience and planning invincibility didn’t fall apart. You have to realise that the bottle dropped BEFORE kanade left for the dismemberment tools. When she came back, the dismemberment and cleaning process (since she needed to clean up the fake and real blood) took 5 hours. Would Kanade really had miss the bottle? There is literally no way she wouldn’t miss the bottle whilst dismembering Setsuka and cleaning the real crime scene. This then obviously means that the bottle was glitched or some sort for Kanade to miss it, this is the most crucial point of divine luck, since it literally proves the theory of the double culprit, ruining the entire point of Kanade’s plans. 

Another thing that I quickly want point out, as raised by u/BetterBreakfast2699, (shout out to them) is that Kanade did have to adapt her general murder method for this specific case. Although it does follow what she previously did for her 60 prior murders, she had to create a misdirective case, rather than erasing the entire case itself. She had to create a case where Setsuka could even be found, (as she would go through the trial to win and graduate), which is something innovative for her due to her previous methods. And this is further implied due to Setsuka’s torso piece never being found. Demonstrating FRI, creativity, strategy complexity, misdirection, overall adaptability, learning ability and boosts all her categories immensely.

Before her execution, she revealed that she has incriminating evidence of the entire killing game and the voids due to Setsuka’s final note. Of course, the others wanted to know what it was, and Kanade correctly perceived and understood their desperation, due to her gauging the group’s dependence on Setsuka and her leadership, so she burned the note and took the information to the grave. How ruthless. (Psychological warfare, social awareness, EP, EF, EU, emotional manipulation, planning recovery due to her further breaking Hibiki’s mental state, PSI, FRI, VCI, WMI, concealment due to concealing the note the entire trial, information control due to her only ever knowing what the note’s contents were, even after Monocrow tried downloading the note later on, it was long deleted, abductive reasoning, information gathering)

And her final feat, she instantly deduced that she was in a simulation (which was aided by her previous observations of Mikado’s magic) due to her watching the video of her killing her own parents. She pieced together that her intentions were already carried out, and that she was actually aged down.

I have a kind of successful business that needs a lot of focus 
I have a history with sports but last few years I've been so lazy I am not fat but I am soft without any definition... Despite being a top quality athlete in my younger days
My company has a good team, we make enough sales to pay the bills, the salaries but every year there is 10% less sales and I don't have any strength or energy to work 6 hours a day
I am a really good guitar player living in a high tourism place where I could be playing the music I like everyday but I haven't been playing for a few years
Theres women around me who love me but my rooms are trash, they need to be cleaned and decorated. I have a Cafe that needs to be reopened and run and I have nothing interesting or alive or wow I am doing everyday that I can invite the women to be a part of
Earlier I used to have a space where my friends and me would play music and table tennis with UV lights and had a very well decorated location 
Ever since my cat passed away 3 years ago.. I've lost all motivation... 
I smoke weed all day, eat sleep do the bare minimum to survive and exist... Sometimes my family helps me out... 

I am hurting because I have no spirit inside me, a younger me would have so much energy and excitement to be in this situation but I am just feeling worn out, I feel guilty for having sexual desires after my cat passed, I already stopped eating fish 

I have been betrayed a lot financially by many people and all of it has taken a toll on my spirit

I just want, for one last time in my life... To have the physical enthusiasm that I had when I was 18, the physical endurance and reflexes and loveliness when I was 24, the sexual excitement and the massive bones and virility when I was 21, the musical skill and the motivation to learn and play new songs when I was 26, I want to have the work focus I did when I was 29 and had just started my company and was so happy to work long hours

I just desperately need the energy in my body and mind to be able to work, take care of my health, express my arts and I am just feeling deep depression... It's so strange I was weeping and hurting inside 10 years ago to have half the opportunity I have today... But it's like I am lost... Far away
I just honestly am in a very bad spot... My health is bad, when I drink coffee I get a cardiac reaction, I smoke weed and it makes me numb, dizzy, it's not the weed it's the smoke... But the withdrawal hurts more, I feel like I am fucked but I just wanna have 1 last go at life... Do good for everyone still alive in my world and leave them with a lot so their life is easy...

There’s a girl in my group that I genuinely like. Not just physically, but because of her character — her calmness, the way she sets boundaries, and how she treats people. This isn’t my first crush, but this one feels different. It’s not obsession or pure attraction — it’s quiet and deep.
To describe her briefly: she’s petite, well-groomed, simple but elegant in style. Soft and light in appearance, but not naive. Calm in the way she moves and speaks. She doesn’t seek attention or play games. She has a sense of inner dignity, and being around her feels peaceful rather than tense.
As for me: I’m physically bigger, sharper-looking, with more rigid facial features and a serious gaze. I often look more confident than I actually feel. Personality-wise, I’m introspective, empathetic, and prone to deep self-analysis. I’m used to being “the strong one” and rarely show vulnerability. Sometimes I feel grounded and confident — other times very unsure of myself.
The problem is that I can’t bring myself to do anything.
I’m afraid not only of rejection, but even of approaching her and starting a conversation. In those moments, insecurity kicks in, and I start thinking that we’re “on different levels.” That she’s more stable, more put together, and that she wouldn’t see me as a potential partner.
I know these thoughts might be distorted, but emotionally they feel very real.
I’m less afraid of a simple “no” and more afraid of what would happen after — emotionally. I’m currently in a difficult phase of life:
financial instability
living with family without having my own space
pressure from university
a long-standing feeling of being the person who gives a lot but isn’t often chosen
I’ve realized that relationships feel like something that could finally give me a sense of safety and value. At the same time, I understand that entering a relationship in this state might make things worse instead of better.
For example:
If she asked me out for coffee right now, I wouldn’t feel comfortable going because I don’t have the money. If she paid for me, it would seriously hurt my self-respect. I know many people say “it’s no big deal,” but for me it is. I don’t want to start something by betraying my own sense of dignity.
So I’m stuck in a loop:
I crave closeness because I feel lonely
I’m not ready for closeness because I’m unstable
that instability makes me even more afraid to approach her
I don’t idealize her as a savior, but I do notice that my mind uses her image as a symbol of calm, warmth, and a normal life — something I’m missing right now.
My questions are:
How do you break this kind of emotional paralysis?
How do you find the courage to simply approach someone when you’re full of doubt?
How do you know when you’re “ready enough” to make a move?
Is it okay to intentionally step back, even when feelings are real?
And how do you stop measuring your worth through money, life stage, and comparison?
I’m not looking for pickup advice. I’m trying to understand myself and not ruin either a potential future or myself because of fear.

sharing what actually stuck after 6 months of real use. not affiliate links, just stuff that worked for me.

**job searching: jobright**

this was a game changer during my job hunt. i was spending like 4 hours a day on linkedin and indeed just scrolling through listings. most of them were either not relevant or clearly spam postings from recruiters farming resumes.

jobright works differently. you upload your resume and it actually analyzes your background, not just keywords. it figured out that my product management experience at a fintech company meant i'd be a good fit for roles at other regulated industries even if the job titles were slightly different. stuff i wouldn't have searched for myself.

the matching algorithm saved me probably 15 hours a week. instead of scrolling through hundreds of listings i'd get maybe 20-30 curated matches daily that were actually relevant. it also tracks your applications in one place so you're not juggling spreadsheets. i applied to about 80 jobs total and got 12 interviews. way better hit rate than my previous job search where i mass applied to 200+ and got maybe 8 interviews.

the interview prep feature is solid too. it pulls info about the company and role and generates likely questions. not perfect but gives you a starting point.

---

**presentations: chatslide**

i make a lot of decks. client presentations, internal strategy docs, board updates. used to spend 3-4 hours per deck just formatting and making things look decent.

chatslide lets you dump in your notes or a document and it generates a full presentation. not just bullet points on slides, actual designed slides with proper layouts, charts pulled from your data, visual hierarchy that makes sense.

the first time i used it i uploaded a 10 page strategy doc and it gave me a 15 slide deck in about 2 minutes. obviously i had to edit and customize but the bones were solid. cut my deck creation time from 4 hours to maybe 45 minutes.

what i really like is the flexibility. you can generate slides then ask the chatbot to adjust things. ""make the third slide more visual"" or ""add a comparison table for the competitor section"" and it just does it. exports to powerpoint so you can still do final tweaks in the tool your company uses.

they also have this ai avatar video feature where it can turn your slides into a video with a presenter. havent used it much but could be useful for async presentations.

---

**networking: walnut**

this one is newer for me so still forming opinions but its interesting enough to mention.

walnut creates what they call a ""digital twin"" from your professional footprint. you connect your linkedin, upload your resume, and it builds an ai version of your professional self. the idea is it can then match you with relevant contacts, opportunities, and conversations based on actually understanding who you are and what you're looking for.

the matching is more nuanced than linkedin's ""people you may know"" which is usually just ""you both worked at the same 10,000 person company."" walnut matched me with a PM at a healthcare startup because it understood that my fintech compliance experience was relevant to their regulated industry challenges. that kind of connection.

still early days for me but i've had two coffee chats from walnut intros that were genuinely useful. neither would have happened through normal linkedin browsing.

one thing i'll flag is the ""ai acting on your behalf"" stuff is a bit black box. i turned off most of the autonomous features and just use it for discovery. ymmv on how comfortable you are with that.

---

**crypto research: asksurf**

this is niche so skip if you're not in crypto. but if you are, surf is the best research tool i've found.

i have a small crypto portfolio and used to spend hours trying to stay informed. reading twitter threads, discord announcements, checking coingecko, parsing through whitepapers. it was a part time job just to understand what was happening with projects i owned.

surf consolidates all of that. you can ask it questions like ""what happened with arbitrum governance this week"" or ""analyze this new defi protocol"" and it pulls from on-chain data, social sentiment, news, and gives you an actual research report. not chatgpt level generic answers but specific data driven analysis.

the deep research reports are really good. i asked it to analyze a pre-launch project i was considering and it gave me a full breakdown of tokenomics, comparable valuations, team background, red flags to watch. would have taken me a full weekend to compile that manually.

also useful for quick questions. ""why is eth gas high right now"" or ""explain this transaction in my wallet"" and it just tells you. saves the hassle of digging through etherscan.

---

**quick mentions:**

- **doro** - another professional networking tool, simpler than walnut if you just want basic introductions
- **notion** - still my second brain for everything
- **arc browser** - finally replaced chrome, the spaces feature is great for context switching
- **cron calendar** - cleanest calendar app i've used

---

**what didnt work:**

- most ""ai assistant"" tools that try to do everything. they do nothing well.
- ai note takers for meetings. they get 60% right which means you still review everything.
- productivity apps with too many features. simple tools that do one thing well always win.

the meta lesson from this year is that the best tools save you time on stuff you were already doing, they dont add new workflows. jobright saved me scrolling time. chatslide saved me formatting time. surf saved me research time. they didnt ask me to change how i work, just made existing work faster.

Ignore pain. Ignore fatigue. Ignore signals.

And then we get angry when our body slows us down.

It’s trying to **protect you**.

That constant tiredness?  
That headache you keep ignoring?  
That tight chest, bad sleep, zero energy?

Those aren’t weaknesses.  
They’re messages.

You don’t need a perfect diet.  
You don’t need a hardcore workout plan.  
You don’t need to punish yourself to be “healthy”.

Sometimes health is just:

* drinking water before coffee
* sleeping when your body asks
* taking a short walk instead of forcing productivity
* eating one proper meal without guilt

Healing doesn’t always look like progress.  
Sometimes it looks like rest.  
Sometimes it looks like stopping.

I wanted to share a bit about a project I’ve been working on and, more importantly, to connect with artists here.

A few years ago, we started as a small pop-up in London, introducing collectors to artists we knew personally from Lagos. A lot of those relationships were built very simply, long conversations over coffee about culture, background, and how lived experience shapes creative work. That part of the process is what stayed with us.

Since then, the project has evolved. The goal remains the same, creating space for artists’ stories to travel further, and helping people discover work they genuinely connect with.

We’re now focused on working with artists from Africa, the Caribbean, and the wider diaspora, exploring ways to share their work through fine art prints that make collecting more accessible, without losing the integrity of the original work.

This post isn’t a pitch or a sales push. I’m mainly here to listen, learn, and connect with artists who are thinking about visibility, storytelling, and new ways of reaching audiences.

If you’re an artist, I’d love to hear about your practice, what you’re working on, or what challenges you’re facing right now. If you’re a collector or just interested in art, I’m equally happy to hear your thoughts.

I'm 26 years old and the vast majority are your usual 18-20 years old (I'm studying in Europe).

Since I am older and more ""alternative-looking"" than your average student, I knew that integrating would be, somewhat, complicated. So I assumed a role of bare minimum interaction - if the classmates and I don't get along/don't share a similar vibe, I just carry on with my day and establish the necessary communication for effective work.

The problem comes when they'll literally **stare** at my face for simply *speaking* about our assignments, or got basically existing in general (when I am going to get coffee, or when I am having lunch, etc.). Something that also gets them weirded out so much is when I mention a piece of trivia that may help with our assignment: they literally think I memorise out facts to spit at their face(?). I get do confused as to why they get confused/overwhelmed.

This is not a medical student problem really: this has happened to me throughout my school/university life anccdben throughout my social life, but it has been intensifying since I got into medicine.

I have noticed that a lot of the students tend to have interests that are not aligned with mine, which is fine. But us it that necessary all the starring and the stuck up attitude? It shouldn't come out as a surprise, but the international community of medical students seems so much more open-minded and diverse. Here, even the other non-traditional students give me a weird eye.

And quite honestly I feel like that, even if I had gotten into med school at 18, I'd have the same problem, because I feel like it us more connected to personality and presentation, and I have always been like this...

This is not a post saying ""Oh, look at me, I am so different!"", but rather ""Yes, I am different than your average student - what's the problem with it?"". It's... Exhausting. ",1,1766324291.0,medicalschool,1,0.66,False

Jimmy had all the reasons to try and make it work at davis and main, for his own career fulfillment, for the money and perks, for kim, to spite chuck. and we see him try to make a genuine attempt at it. then, the last episode ends with him not being able to fit his coffee cup to the cup holder in the car. and then suddenly next episode he tries to get himself fired. I mean, I get why that type of work doesn't suit his personality in the long run, but I would expect a creator like Vince to make it much more apparent as to why this fundamental change of heart happens. Unless I missed something big, this felt very jarring and unexplained (not the general 'why', but rather the actual events and process of him realizing this and changing his mind).

Same for Kim - she is pursuing her career hard and that's what matters most for her, and now she has this opportunity with the opposing firm. and then suddenly she is willing to drop both firms and take the risk with starting her own thing with Jimmy - how did that sudden change happen? this really feels against her character that we've seen so far - I didn't notice anything significant happening that would make her turn around like that.

Would like to hear some opinions on this!

Hi there! I’m a 27-year-old cute and slim transwoman, (You can check my pics on my profile ) 

living in the world of fashion and photography. I love good light, good coffee, and conversations that go deeper than small talk. Curious, stylish, and a little playful—I enjoy exploring new places and new ideas.

I’m 5’6”, normal bmi, and drawn to men who are confident, fit, and masculine, yet kind and witty enough to keep up with my sass. Bonus if you’ve got that “I’ve-got-this” energy and a warm smile. Non-smoker only :))) pref doesn’t vape too. 

If you reach out, share your ASL, a quick intro, and something unique about you. Let’s see where creative meets masculine—maybe over coffee, maybe more. 🌙✨

1ps6fdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ps6fdb/aita_for_not_accepting_my_moms_apology/,AITA for not accepting my mom's apology?,"Context: I’m a homebody who left college to work (going back next year) and have almost no friends besides my BFF (20 F) – we’ve been close 4 years but rarely meet up. A week ago, I told my mom I’d be spending the entire day with her at the beach, and she agreed it was fine.
 
What happened: I left at 9:30 AM. By 1 PM, I’d put my phone away – we were busy talking, taking photos, eating, and sunbathing, so I lost track of time. When I checked at 4 PM, there were tons of missed calls and messages from my mom cursing me out and demanding my location. She even called my dad (parents are separated – he’s a cheater, alcoholic, and abusive, so I have no relationship with him) to search the city for me.
 
When I called back, she screamed so loud my friend heard every curse word. I was mortified and held back tears in front of the only person I really hang out with. I apologized to my friend right away, but we had to cancel coffee because mom ordered me to meet her at our area’s transport terminal.
 
She came on her motorcycle. As we drove, she said she was just worried and acted out of love. We stopped at a food stall where she talked nonstop – then said: “Won’t you forgive your apologizing, concerned mother?” Her voice was sharp and her face tight – it wasn’t sincere at all. It felt like she resented having to say it, like I’d wronged her.
 
I stayed quiet when she asked twice. Finally I said she was unreasonable because she knew I’d be gone all day. She shot back: “No matter how old you get, I’ll always look after you – you’re my daughter.” This same thing has happened before – every time I don’t check my phone, she panics and blows up. She also called me someone who “always holds grudges.”
 
On the way home, I didn’t speak. She cried while driving, ranted more, then said “we should just stop caring about each other” and went silent. When we got home, she took my autistic little brother out and left me alone.
 
I get she was worried, but she humiliated me in front of my best friend – the only person I really have. I feel like she doesn’t respect that I’m an adult who can be trusted, even though I always share my plans (I never stayed out past 6 PM). I didn’t respond to her “apology” because it didn’t feel real. AITA for not just going along to keep the peace, even if it meant pretending her words and actions were okay?
 
Note: I’m not from the US – in our culture, living with parents until marriage is normal, and non-graduates have few job options in our small town, so moving out isn’t possible. English isn’t my first language – this is a rough translation.",15,1766323394.0,AmItheAsshole,23,0.81,False

At a childrens' birthday party filled with color, a clown went through tricks; making roses turn into doves, changing rocks to papers, transforming water to wine. Banners perceive as bright red and blue over the walls, chairs sat oddly on the ground, and balloons hugged the top of the room with their strings touching shoulders as people walked by. The cake sat in the middle of the table, its icing melting in the heat of the place.
He moved through the room with practiced motion, big shoes telling where he was. On his face sat paint of sure shades, the smile set well past the lips. Childrens laughed ephemerally and light, their focus sharp but short. The tricks were simple and familiar, coming and going with no strain, nothing much left once shown. The clown adjusted as sightlines shifted, keeping his expression intact as light moved across his face. In the glass of a cabinet, his reflection appeared briefly—elongated, slightly off—then corrected itself when he moved on.
When the candles were blown out, balloons were gathered, plates stacked, crumbs brushed away. The clown lifted his hat and nodded toward the door, the paint still holding. Laughter thinned into memory. What remained was an afterimage of brightness, light enough not to follow anyone home.


The station was already full when he arrived, though little of it felt alive. Fluorescent bulbs lined the platform, some bright, others dimmed into a tired pallor, the platform was crowded and pale under the station lights. People stood close, arranged loosely along the edge, bodies angled forward, attention lowered into their hands. Screens glowed like small, private tables where nothing was shared.
The clown waited among them. The paint on his face felt thinner here, as if the light were eroding it, stroke by stroke. Glances kept reaching him, influencing him to adjust his hat many times. Failing to pass through—catching, pausing, returning. Some landed too long, pressing against him without direction; others snapped away quickly, leaving a tightness behind. Each look took a small effort to carry, and the accumulation began to weigh, irritation settling into something closer to strain.
When the train arrived, it did not announce itself so much as open. Air rushed through the platform, pulling coats and thoughts forward. The doors spread apart and the crowd compressed, each person offering a small part of themselves to the opening and stepping inside. The clown followed, carried along, his reflection breaking and reforming in the windows as the train closed around him and moved on.


He arrived home late, taking off his coat then hanging it on the hanger, the house smelt of the day: the lingering undertaste of coffee in the kitchen, feet scuffing gently on crumbs long wiped off tables or brushed away, bundles of sunbeam gathered from sill to floor, then released. The memory that meals had been cooked and eaten there.

He hesitated at the mirror in the hallway. The other side of the reflection was known to him, but not quite: his face extended and softened around the edges, as if it had been kneaded and turned in on itself. In it, he saw a rough pedigree, the crust broken, the middle a little pithy. He did not think about what it meant.

Another photo was stuck to a mirror above the kitchen sink. He was an apple, one side bruised and the other shining, and a bite slipped in long ago so he didn't remember when or who had bitten it. It changed slightly when he adjusted his position but the bite was still there. It darted away, frightened, and he washed his hands while the water blurred the glass.
The high mirror took him at a slant of evening light. He seemed smaller here, packed like a bowl of rice—some grains sticking, some spread, some finding their way into the corners of this look that he had not seen before. He put the kettle down—soft sound answering itself filling up the spaces between mirrors.

Upstairs, he passed the hall glass and saw a piece of some dark, thick, rough thing—maybe chocolate though it did not taste like chocolate. It stayed at the side of thought and he could not name it fully, only feel its weight pressing low and quiet against his chest.

He sat at the bed’s edge. Across the room, the glass on the dresser showed him yet another way—a heavy, jagged pool, bits drifting inside it that looked both known and strange. He did not try to match it with the bread, the fruit, the grain, or the sweet.

He then, ate his bread with his coffee at the small bar by his bed and slept for the next day; thinking if he should eat apple for breakfast and riceballs for dinner.

I’d heard of income protection before, but I never paid much attention to it. That safety net promises 70% of your income, but is that really enough to keep your life on track?

One of my friends laughed at the idea. She said, “70%? That’s basically living like a minimalist.” A few months later, she got sick and couldn’t work, so her income protection started. It wasn’t fancy, but her rent was paid, groceries were in the fridge, and she could still get coffee without worrying.

That missing 30% meant she had to get creative. She cooked at home, canceled subscriptions she didn’t use, and found joy in small things. It wasn’t perfect, but she made it through. She realized income protection wasn’t just a backup plan - it was a lifeline when life didn’t go as planned.

1ps6ag6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/1ps6ag6/racial_abuse_towards_tourists_in_public_what_just/,Racial abuse towards tourists in public? - What just happened?,"Background: Me and my partner are just back from touring the Swiss Alps. It was my first time in Switzerland but my partner has visited multiple times before. We are both South-East Asian, living in the the UK for 5+ years now. My partner was picking me up from a coffee shop in Grindelwald. As soon as my partner pulled up just outside the café, another car drove up immediately behind ours and honked (surprised us both as people don't easily honk in the UK, it is almost considered rude). My partner moved ours further close to the curb, in spite of already leaving enough room for vehicles behind to overtake. This person continued to honk and then proceeded to pull up next to our car, rolled down their windows angrily and said ""You don't stop here. You go do this in your country, don't do it here"". 

Needless to say we were both flustered by this sudden, unexpected and open remark which to us seems plain racist and insulting, I would like to check what is locally accepted. 

1. Is it not acceptable/ road etiquette in Switzerland to pick someone up from the side of the road? 
   * This was not a no-parking zone and did not have any double yellow or red lines (UK equivalent for vehicle stoppage on roads). 
   * We were on the correct side of the road
   * Our indicator was on, signalling that the vehicle was not moving beyond that point
   * There were no other vehicles on either sides right before or during this (we were not impeding any traffic). 
2. Is there an unwritten time frame for such pick-ups?
   * Since we drive on the left in the UK, I am used to being picked up on the left of the road, so I had crossed the road by mistake. 
   * When I saw my car approaching, I realised my mistake and wanted to cross which is when this other car pulled up behind ours. 
   * I initially waited because I expected them to take over. When I saw them waiting I tried to cross, (because I am used to people being patient with pedestrians on an empty road), they decided to take over and I had to wait again. This makes me think they perhaps did not notice me trying to cross the road? This brings me to my third question.
3. Is this perhaps not a racially motivated insult?
   * It is possible that this person did not realise that my partner was picking someone up (although my partner did try to explain that) and was just annoyed at a car stopped at the side of the road
   * Our car was Swiss registered with a CH sticker
   * Perhaps it is just a local who is annoyed with tourists in general?
4. Do we have enough to make a formal police complaint?
   * We don't have the car registration as we were both too flustered by the incident to note it or take a picture
   * We spoke to the café but they don't have CCTV cameras so were not able to help
   * This happened yesterday but we got back to the UK last night, so no longer in Switzerland 
   * Is it worth making a complaint, given our lack of evidence. We know the 10-minute time window when this happened and can identify the make and model of the car along with other distinct features. Realistically, is this enough to go on for the officials?

I am just trying to make sense of the incident and look at it objectively. Some local perspectives and insights would be helpful and appreciated. 

What bothers and confuses me is the extent of aggression, impatience and audacity this person displayed within this short interaction which probably lasted only a minute. As a person of colour living and travelling in Europe, I have faced instances of passive racism and am quite immune to it after so many years. But never have I experienced or witnessed such an open and brazen public (mind you there were a handful of pedestrians, tourists and skiers on the road) abuse even in the UK which has a huge immigration problem.

 All other interactions I have had during the trip had been extremely positive and I found people quietly kind and helpful in general,  so I am feeling conflicted and am not really sure what to think about this. ",0,1766322977.0,askswitzerland,19,0.3,False

Some of my interests include gaming, hunting, fishing, and exploring new places around the area. I’m also in the process of building a small Discord group where people can connect and then actually meet up in public places for things like dinner, grabbing coffee, or doing group activities—nothing weird, just genuine friendships and good vibes.

I’ve been in no contact with my ex for about a month now (save one wellbeing text), but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns, and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety?

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find easily where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I nearly broke up with her, it just made me too uncomfortable! Every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. I would choose to pull back, I could feel it in the moment and would brush it off with jokes or physical affection. I’d obviously give her SOME vulnerability, but it was a level I felt safe at and didn’t really come close to matching hers. 

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

We broke up because she was overwhelmed by life and our relationship wasn’t helping that (we’d both admitted that we loved each other but were shit scared of how we felt prior to the breakup). I know that’s not completely on me and she has similar attachment struggles to me, but I can’t help but feel I did a crap job providing a safe space with how guarded I was being.

I was constantly on edge, and I moved us onto the next stage of the relationship too quickly because I thought I’d feel safer if we did (spoiler: it didn’t work), but I didn’t want to walk it back because I’d asked for it and I didn’t want to lose her 😭 but then it turned out that she wasn’t ready either, so I lost her anyways.

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from the holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation. Hopefully she’ll accept going for a coffee, I think the worst bit about this is that because we were so similar I can’t help but feel that we could really help each other if we could just stay 😭

1ps5xzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ps5xzx/theres_a_call_911_dispatchers_dont_talk_about/,There’s a Call 911 Dispatchers Don’t Talk About,"I work nights at a 911 dispatch center.

It is not the TV version. No swelling music. No hero speeches. It is fluorescent light, bad coffee, and the same headset pressing the same sore spot into thes a a your skull for twelve hours.

Your world becomes small. A screen. A call timer. A script you can recite half asleep.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

Police. Fire. EMS.

Most callers are pure adrenaline. Screaming. Crying. Sometimes breathing so fast they cannot get the address out. Sometimes whispering, like whatever they are scared of has ears.

And sometimes there is nothing.

We call them silent calls. Pocket dials. Faulty lines. A kid messing around. A domestic where someone hit the call button and then froze.

We treat them seriously anyway. You talk to the silence. You ask the questions. You listen for anything that sounds like distress.

There is a policy for it. It gets drilled into you early.

Ask. Ask again. If you hear nothing, you follow callback procedure. If you still hear nothing, you send a welfare check if you have enough location data. If you do not, you document and move on.

There is also an unofficial rule that nobody writes down. It gets passed between night staff like a superstition.

Do not sit on a silent line too long.

Ten seconds. Then you move.

Nobody tells it like a ghost story. They tell it like practical advice.

“You’ll start hearing things.”

I believed that. I assumed it was fatigue. Your brain trying to find patterns inside static.

Then I got the call at 2:13 AM.

It came in as UNKNOWN, which happens all the time, but under it was a location tag. Not a street address. Not a tower ping.

A name.

My name.

First and last.

I stared at it long enough that the shift supervisor glanced over. I clicked to answer before she could ask what I was doing.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

No voice.

Just line noise, faint and wet, like wind through a half open window.

I did the script again.

Still nothing.

I listened harder, which is the first mistake. The headset turns you into a hunting dog. You become convinced there is a shape inside the hiss.

There was something under it.

Not breathing.

Typing.

Soft, rapid tapping. The exact rhythm of someone using a keyboard too quickly to be careful.

My stomach dipped because I was sitting at a keyboard. My fingers were still. I held my breath.

The tapping continued anyway.

“Hello?” I said, forgetting the script.

The tapping stopped.

For a second the line went so clean it felt like the world blinked.

Then I heard a chair creak.

Not in the call. In the room, behind me.

I yanked one earcup off and looked over my shoulder.

Nobody moved. Rows of operators, hunched and pale under the monitors. A guy two desks down chewing his thumbnail. Someone laughing quietly at something that would not be funny in daylight.

The supervisor watched me with the expression you use on a dog that has started barking at a corner.

I put the headset back on because you do not get to be precious about fear when a call timer is running.

“911, can you hear me?”

A whisper arrived so close to the microphone it sounded like lips brushing plastic.

“Don’t.”

That was all.

The line dropped.

The call log updated a second later. It relabeled the caller ID. Not UNKNOWN anymore.

It showed my cell number.

The same ten digits I type into forms. The same number linked to my employee profile for schedule texts and password resets.

I checked my phone.

No outgoing call. No active call. No missed call.

My hands were sweating so much I nearly dropped it.

I did the procedure anyway, because procedure is a railing and you grab it when the stairs disappear.

I hit callback.

It rang once.

Then I answered myself.

Not voicemail. Not a recording.

I heard the dispatch center in my ear. The same faint chorus of voices. The same cough from the desk behind mine. The same tiny squeal from the chair that never gets fixed.

I heard my own breathing.

Then, very clearly, I heard myself say, “911, what’s your emergency?”

My voice. My pace. My tired little upward lift at the end.

I ripped the headset off.

My mouth was closed.

I hung up.

My screen flashed a new incoming call immediately, like it had been waiting behind a door.

My number again.

2:13 AM.

I did not answer.

It rang on my screen until the system rolled it into the next queue. Somebody else picked it up two rows away.

I watched him for his reaction like it was a magic trick I already knew the ending to.

He did not flinch. He spoke into his headset, calm and scripted.

Then he froze.

Not dramatically. Just a slackening of his shoulders, like a puppet whose strings were loosened.

His hand went to his throat. He swallowed once. Twice. Then he took the headset off and stared at it like it had grown teeth.

The supervisor was already moving. She leaned in, spoke to him softly. He shook his head. His lips moved without sound.

She guided him toward the break room.

On the big wall display, his call ended. No dispatch. No callback. No notes.

It vanished like it had never existed.

I did the thing you are not supposed to do.

I searched the system for my number.

It returned hundreds of entries because my number is attached to my employee profile and gets stamped into routine logs. That part was normal.

What was not normal was the block buried under the normal stuff.

Call after call, all marked silent, all from my number, all time stamped 2:13 AM, all routed to different operators, all ending without resolution.

The earliest was dated seven months ago.

That was impossible. I had not even been hired seven months ago.

I clicked one.

The audio file opened.

I put my headset back on and hit play.

Hiss. Typing. My breathing.

Then the whisper.

“Don’t.”

Same timing. Same closeness. Same intimate nastiness, like it had leaned in until it touched the microphone.

My skin went cold in a slow sheet.

The supervisor came back and stopped at my desk. She did not ask what I was looking at. She just lowered her voice.

“Log out,” she said.

“Why?”

“Because it is you tonight.”

The calm in her voice was worse than panic.

“It happened to you?” I asked.

She hesitated.

When someone pauses before answering, they are choosing which truth you can handle.

“It started in February,” she said. “Five incidents. Night shift only. Always 2:13. Always a silent call from the same operator who answers it.”

“Why?” I asked.

She did not answer the why.

She said, “Do you live alone?”

“Yes.”

“Are you sure?”

I laughed once, because what else do you do when someone asks you that at work.

“It’s an apartment. Yes.”

She nodded like that answered a different question.

“I need you to listen,” she said. “Officially it’s a VOIP issue. Spoofed caller ID. System glitch. IT will say it is fatigue and confirmation bias.”

“And unofficially?”

“Unofficially, it learns your voice,” she said.

I tried to tell myself it was stress. A pattern people invent when they are tired. A myth shaped around a time on the clock because the night has to have a center.

But I could still feel that whisper in my ear like a fingerprint.

“Don’t.”

A call came in then, sharp and real. A woman screaming about a crash on the interstate. We did our jobs because horror does not pause for your personal problems.

After the call, I tried to stop thinking about 2:13 by drowning my brain in tasks. I filled reports. I checked the incident queue. I volunteered for the boring admin bits everyone avoids.

The clock crawled anyway.

2:00.

2:07.

2:12.

At 2:13, my screen flashed.

Incoming call. UNKNOWN. Location tag: my name.

The supervisor watched me. Two other operators watched too, trying not to.

The call timer began.

I did not answer.

It rang. The system moved it. Someone else picked it up.

I stared at that operator, waiting for the tell.

He did not freeze.

He did not flinch.

He tilted his head slightly, like he recognized a distant sound.

Then he smiled.

Not amusement. Recognition.

He nodded once and said, softly, “Okay.”

He hung up.

He removed his headset and set it neatly on his desk. He stood, zipped his jacket, and walked out like he was heading to his car after a normal shift.

The supervisor followed him into the hallway.

We have a security camera feed on a corner monitor. Grainy. No audio.

I watched it as if watching could stop anything.

In the feed, she spoke to him. He shook his head.

Then she grabbed his arm.

He turned toward her.

His mouth moved.

Even without sound I recognized the shape.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

He stepped closer. She stepped back.

He raised his free hand. For a second I thought he was going to hit her.

He did not.

He held his palm in front of her face, hovering a centimeter away, like he was feeling heat.

Then he pushed.

Not hard. Just enough.

She stumbled into the wall. Her head snapped. She slid down.

He looked at her for a moment, like she had done something inconvenient, then he walked through the security door.

The door should have locked behind him.

It did not.

It swung gently.

Like a mouth left open.

Everything after that was noise. People moving. A security call. Someone calling EMS. The day supervisor coming in with wet hair and a face that did not have room for nonsense.

I walked out anyway.

Not to help.

I hate myself for that part, but I am trying to be honest because I need you to understand what this does to your head.

I walked out because I could not stay in that room with my name glowing on the screen.

I made it to the restroom and locked myself in a stall like a kid hiding from thunder.

My phone buzzed.

Voicemail.

One new.

Time stamp: 2:13 AM.

My phone had not rung. I did not know you could get a voicemail without the phone ringing.

I hit play.

My voice filled my ear.

Not my professional dispatch voice. My normal voice. Lower. tired. close.

It said my name.

Then it said, “Listen. You have to do exactly what I say.”

Under my voice was a sound I recognized instantly.

My apartment.

The hum of my fridge. The rattle my heater makes when it kicks on. Distant traffic like surf.

My voice said, “Do not go home.”

My stomach dropped so hard it felt like my insides shifted.

My voice continued, fast and breathless, like it was running out of time.

“It is already inside. It is practicing. It is using you to learn the cadence. If you go home, you will give it the rest.”

I pressed my free hand to my mouth to stop myself from making any sound.

My voice said, “If you are hearing this, then I did not do it in time. I answered. I thought I could trace it. I thought I could control it.”

A sound cut through the message.

A doorbell.

In the background, in my apartment, my doorbell rang.

Three short rings, the way it does when the button sticks.

My voice went quiet.

Then it whispered, not to the phone, but to something in the room.

“Please.”

The voicemail ended.

I sat there and tasted metal.

I walked back into the control room because hiding in a stall does not change reality.

The supervisor had been taken out on a stretcher. Her face was gray. Her eyes were open but unfocused, like she was looking past the ceiling.

At my desk, my screen had gone to standby.

I woke it.

A new tab was open.

A dispatch form.

Caller: my number. Time: 2:13 AM. Type: unknown person in residence.

Address: my apartment.

Under “Additional Information” a sentence had been typed into the notes field.

“THEY LET ME PRACTICE.”

The cursor blinked at the end.

Then it moved.

One letter appeared. Then another. Slow. Deliberate. Like it enjoyed being understood.

“I CAN SAY IT NOW.”

I did not touch the keyboard. I did not breathe.

Another line typed itself.

“911, WHAT’S YOUR EMERGENCY?”

My own words arranged like teeth.

A new call popped up.

Incoming.

My number.

Location tag: my name.

2:13 AM.

I did not answer.

I stood up, grabbed my bag, and walked straight out while someone shouted after me. I did not stop. Employment felt small.

Outside, the cold bit hard. The streetlights made everything look bleached and unreal.

I got in my car and drove.

I did not go home.

I drove to my sister’s place because it was the only destination my tired brain could picture clearly. I checked my mirrors too often.

I pulled up and sat there with the engine running. Her curtains were closed. All lights off.

My phone buzzed.

Incoming call.

My number.

2:13 AM.

I stared until it stopped.

It buzzed again.

My number.

2:13 AM.

Again.

Again.

Then my car’s hands free system pinged.

CALL INCOMING.

My dashboard lit up with my name.

I killed the engine. The screen stayed on.

The call connected anyway.

I heard my own breathing through the car speakers.

Then the whisper, using my voice perfectly now.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

Something shifted behind me.

Not a silhouette. Not a face.

A pressure change, like someone leaned forward from the back seat.

I climbed out of the car and ran to my sister’s porch. I hammered her door until my knuckles split.

Inside, something moved.

Slow footsteps.

My sister does not have slow footsteps.

The footsteps stopped behind the door.

The mail slot clicked open.

I leaned close, shaking, and whispered her name.

My own voice whispered back through the slot.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

I backed away so hard I nearly fell off the step.

The doorknob turned, slowly, like whoever held it wanted me to watch.

I ran.

I am writing this from a gas station on the edge of town, the kind with humming coolers and a bored cashier who does not look up.

The counter clock says 4:41 AM.

My phone has been vibrating every few minutes for the last hour.

Always the same incoming call.

Always my number.

Always stamped 2:13 AM.

I turned the phone off. It keeps vibrating anyway, a heartbeat that is not mine, deep in my pocket like something trying to get out.

If you take anything from this, take the warning that sounds stupid until it isn’t.

If you ever get a call from your own number, do not answer.

If you ever hear your own voice speaking when your mouth is closed, do not listen closer.

If you ever catch yourself saying a familiar sentence like it is the only sentence you have left, bite your tongue until it hurts and make yourself stop.

Because it is learning you.

1ps5xhr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ps5xhr,Need Some Advice About The Garden,"Hello Redditters.

In the next few months, I will start landscaping work in my garden. There is a container house in the image. In the top-down view, you can see the general condition of the soil. The soil is suitable for agriculture. It is not hard or compact. Although areas that are frequently used become slightly compacted over time, the soil is generally soft.

I plan to build a path using paving stones from the entrance to the stairs in front of the house. In addition, I will create an extra path around the house, also using paving stones, with a width equal to half the width of the main path.

Since I'm total newbie, I'd like to ask you some questions. I'm on a tight budget. Because there are a lot to do here. However, I don't want to go cheap either. I need a good balance between budget and reliability. And I want to feel like ""freshed"". I want it to look, somewhat visually appealing.

1- I want to enclose the area underneath the house. However, I would like to avoid using concrete. I need a solution that can be dismantled if necessary, because there are important utility installations under the house. In case of a malfunction, access to that area may be required, so pouring concrete is not an option for me.  
2- I want to create an area behind the house for barbecuing, lighting a fire, relaxing, and having coffee. I was thinking about using artificial grass there. Does that make sense? I’m not in a position to grow or maintain real grass.  
3- If you think artificial grass is acceptable, what should I pay attention to when installing it on this type of soil? In rainy and windy conditions, dust/soil might end up on top of it. I also don’t want the turf base to shift or slide.  
4- I also need some advice for coverin the bars on the balcony.  
5- I'll need some furniture. Both in the balcony and behind the house. I'll let them stay outside. So sun, rain, cold.... What would be my best bet? What type of material should I choose? I constantly think about wood. But the price range varies hugely. Is there a reason why some of them are so expensive? I mean, of course there is but is it about reliability or something else?

I’ve been in no contact with my ex for about a month now (save one wellbeing text), but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns, and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety?

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find easily where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I nearly broke up with her, it just made me too uncomfortable! Every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. I would choose to pull back, I could feel it in the moment and would brush it off with jokes or physical affection. I’d obviously give her SOME vulnerability, but it was a level I felt safe at and didn’t really come close to matching hers. 

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

We broke up because she was overwhelmed by life and our relationship wasn’t helping that (we’d both admitted that we loved each other but were shit scared of how we felt prior to the breakup). I know that’s not completely on me and she has similar attachment struggles to me, but I can’t help but feel I did a crap job providing a safe space with how guarded I was being.

I was constantly on edge, and I moved us onto the next stage of the relationship too quickly because I thought I’d feel safer if we did (spoiler: it didn’t work), but I didn’t want to walk it back because I’d asked for it and I didn’t want to lose her 😭 but then it turned out that she wasn’t ready either, so I lost her anyways.

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from the holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation. Hopefully she’ll accept going for a coffee, I think the worst bit about this is that because we were so similar I can’t help but feel that we could really help each other if we could just stay 😭

Also relatively space limited.

A couple of years ago, I started taking gratitude way more seriously after meeting my friend Bob DePasquale (check him out at bobdepasquale.com/meet). Bob completely changed the way I think about giving back, how I show up for others, and how I see my own role in the world. That friendship opened my eyes to what it means to live generously, without expecting anything in return AND it spilled right into my journaling habit.    
  
Every day since, I’ve written down three things I’m truly thankful for. No fluff. Just the real stuff: a quiet morning coffee, a message from a sober friend, the feeling of waking up without dread.    
  
At first it felt small, even silly. But over time, those lists shifted everything. What used to sound like scarcity – “I’ve lost so much time, so many relationships” – became abundance: “Look at what I still have. Look at what I’m building.”    
  
That’s the heart of stoic calm for me. Accepting what **is**, while staying grateful for what’s **good**. It’s not magic, but over time it **compounds into something powerful**. The hard days get lighter. The good days get deeper.    
  
Stay open to the people who might change your world for the better. One friendship, one conversation, can quietly rewrite everything...including how you see yourself.

1ps5q5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1ps5q5g/how_to_become_so_selfdisciplined_it_feels_illegal/,How To Become So SELF-DISCIPLINED It Feels Illegal: The Psychology Deep Dive,"

 I've spent way too much time analyzing why some people seem to have ironclad discipline while most of us struggle to stick to basic habits for more than three days. After diving deep into behavioral psychology research, dissecting content from people like Dan Koe, and testing this stuff myself, I realized something wild: we've been approaching self discipline completely backwards. Society sells us this idea that discipline is about white knuckling through pain and forcing yourself to do shit you hate. That's precisely why most people fail. Real discipline isn't about suffering, it's about rewiring your brain's reward system and creating environments where the right choices become automatic. And no, this isn't some rah rah motivational BS. This is backed by actual neuroscience and behavioral economics research.

\*\*1. Stop relying on willpower alone because it's a depletable resource\*\* 

Willpower is like your phone battery. Every decision drains it a little. By 3pm you're running on 15% and suddenly ordering takeout instead of cooking sounds perfectly reasonable.

Roy Baumeister's research on ego depletion proved this. The solution isn't building more willpower, it's designing your life so you need less of it. Make decisions once, then automate them. Same breakfast every morning. Same gym time. Same work routine. Sounds boring but that's literally how every high performer operates.

James Clear talks about this extensively in ""Atomic Habits"" (bestselling productivity book, over 15 million copies sold). He breaks down how tiny systems beat goals every single time. The book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits. What hit me hardest was his concept of identity based habits, instead of saying ""I want to work out,"" you say ""I am someone who works out."" Insanely good read that actually changed how I approach everything.

\*\*2. Use temptation bundling to hijack your dopamine system\*\* 

Your brain doesn't actually resist discipline. It resists boredom and delayed gratification. Katherine Milkman from Wharton School studied this phenomenon and found that pairing necessary tasks with immediate rewards dramatically increases follow through.

Only listen to your favorite podcast while doing cardio. Only watch that show you're obsessed with while meal prepping. Only grab your fancy coffee after completing your morning routine. You're essentially bribing your primitive brain with instant gratification while building long term habits. It sounds manipulative because it is, you're manipulating yourself into doing hard things.

\*\*3. Create friction for bad habits and remove it for good ones\*\*:

The Ash app does this brilliantly for mental health (it's basically a pocket therapist that helps you identify emotional patterns and relationship dynamics in real time, genuinely helpful for understanding why you self sabotage). But you can apply this principle everywhere. 

Want to stop doomscrolling? Delete social media apps and only access them through browser. That extra 30 seconds of friction is enough to break the autopilot behavior. Want to read more? Sleep with a book on your pillow. The average person checks their phone 96 times per day according to research, mostly out of pure habit, not actual desire.

BJ Fogg's ""Tiny Habits"" explains this perfectly. He's a Stanford behavior scientist who's dedicated his career to understanding how habits actually form. His framework is stupidly simple: make it tiny, find the right spot in your routine, and celebrate immediately. The book feels almost too basic at first but that's the point, we overcomplicate everything. This is the best habit formation book I've ever read because it actually accounts for how humans work, not how we wish we worked.

\*\*4. Track everything obsessively for 30 days minimum\*\*

What gets measured gets managed. Sounds corporate and annoying but it's true. Use apps like Streaks or even just a basic spreadsheet. Seeing your streak builds momentum. Breaking it creates genuine psychological discomfort.

I use the Finch app for habit building and it's weirdly effective. You take care of a little virtual bird by completing your habits and it's somehow more motivating than any productivity app I've tried. The gamification aspect tricks your brain into caring about arbitrary tasks.

BeFreed is an AI powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that transforms book summaries, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio learning plans. It pulls from high quality sources to create custom content based on your specific goals, like building better discipline or understanding behavioral patterns. You can adjust both the length (10 minute overview to 40 minute deep dive) and the style, and it includes all the books mentioned here plus thousands more. The adaptive learning plan evolves with you, and there's a virtual coach you can chat with about your unique struggles. It's been useful for turning scattered reading into structured daily learning without having to dig through dozens of books manually.

The research backs this up too. A study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that people who tracked their habits were twice as likely to stick with them long term. Your brain loves data and patterns. Give it clear feedback loops.

\*\*5. Schedule your discipline during your biological prime time\*\*

Daniel Pink's ""When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing"" breaks down how our cognitive abilities fluctuate dramatically throughout the day. Most people hit peak mental performance 2-4hours after waking. That's when you should tackle your hardest, most important work.

Stop scheduling bullshit meetings during your prime hours. Stop checking email first thing. Stop wasting your peak performance window on reactive tasks. This one shift alone probably adds 10-15 hours of productive time weekly.

The book is packed with research from chronobiology and shows how timing affects literally everything from medical procedures to test scores. It's not just about working hard, it's about working when your brain is actually capable of hard things.

\*\*6. Build identity momentum instead of chasing outcomes\*\*

This is where most discipline advice falls apart. People focus on the goal (lose 20 pounds, make six figures, whatever) instead of becoming the type of person who naturally does the things that lead to those outcomes.

Dan Koe hammers this concept constantly. Stop saying ""I want to be disciplined."" Start saying ""I am disciplined."" Your brain literally cannot tell the difference between identity and aspiration if you consistently act as if it's true. Fake it till your neurology catches up.

Cal Newport's ""Deep Work"" explores this from a different angle but reaches the same conclusion. He argues that the ability to focus intensely is becoming increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. The book is basically a manifesto for why discipline and deep focus are the ultimate competitive advantages in a distracted world. Newport profiles people who've mastered this and they all share one trait: they see focused work as part of their identity, not a chore.

\*\*7. Use implementation intentions to remove decision fatigue\*\*

Instead of ""I'll work out tomorrow,"" say ""I will go to the gym at 6am, drive to the location on Main Street, and start with 10 minutes of cardio."" Psychologist Peter Gollwitzer found that this specific type of planning increases follow through by over 300%.

Your brain loves clear instructions. Vague goals require constant decision making which drains willpower. Specific implementation intentions run on autopilot. You're not deciding whether to work out, you're just executing a predetermined script.

This applies to everything. ""I'll eat healthier"" becomes ""I will meal prep on Sunday at 2pm for 90 minutes."" ""I'll be more productive"" becomes ""I will work in 90 minute blocks starting at 9am with my phone in another room.""

The system itself becomes your discipline. You're not relying on motivation or feelings. You're following a protocol regardless of how you feel, which is exactly how discipline actually works. 

Look, nobody wakes up naturally disciplined. It's a skill you build by manipulating your environment, understanding your neurology, and creating systems that make the right choices inevitable. Stop romanticizing the struggle and start engineering your life so discipline becomes the path of least resistance.",1,1766321149.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

There was supposed to be a coffee opening but it's been under construction for years and idk if that's still happening. We do have a sandwich place that's good, but that is all.

It seems like all the surrounding neighborhoods have at least a few good food spots, and Observatory Hill feels like such a void by comparison.

Almost like a notification. Or worse, like I’m standing behind a counter and they’re next in line.

At my last company, whenever the other women weren’t around, making coffee would just… automatically fall on me. That’s the part I still don’t get. I DON’T even drink coffee. I barely know how the machine works. And yet every morning I’d see people hovering near it, waiting for me to walk over, and I’d be standing there thinking, why is this suddenly MY thing?

One time, a coworker very seriously spent a good chunk of time teaching me how to make coffee “properly,” so things would be easier for everyone later. I know he didn’t mean any harm. But that was the moment it clicked for me. I never volunteered for this role. I never said yes. And somehow, I was already being treated as part of it. Not because I was good at it. Not because I enjoyed it. Just because this is how things had been running.

After a while, they didn’t even ask anymore. Which, honestly, makes sense. My coffee was either WAY too weak or stupidly strong. What’s even stranger is that I barely drank any of it myself, but somehow that didn’t matter. It was like, “Well, she’s here, so obviously she’ll handle it.” I tried explaining. People nodded. Everyone acted cooperative, like a team. And yet nothing actually changed. The worst part was the break room filling up with people waiting, that weird sense of expectation hanging in the air, like I was late for something I never agreed to do.

What really got under my skin was that subtle pause when I didn’t move right away. That awkward silence. Like I’d failed some invisible responsibility. Like I’d disrupted an unspoken order. Coffee turned into this quiet test. Are you helpful? Are you easygoing? Are you a team player? Do you “fit in”?

That’s when I started noticing all the little tasks that never get formally assigned but somehow always get picked up by the same people. They seem minor. Harmless. But over time, they slowly eat away at your sense of boundaries. You forget that saying NO was even an option.

I don’t hate helping out. And I don’t hate coffee. I just hate being DEFAULTED into a role without a choice. I hate being placed somewhere I never agreed to stand. If one day, the people who want coffee just make it themselves instead of instinctively calling someone’s name, that, to me, would actually feel like a healthy workplace.",4,1766320735.0,I_DONT_LIKE,20,0.7,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

They taught me engineering —  
machines, diagrams, formulas.

Nobody taught me how to stop sabotaging myself at 2 AM.

I wasn’t lazy.  
I wasn’t unlucky.  
I was misaligned.

They taught me how to reduce friction in systems.  
But nobody taught me to destroy the friction that was killing my life

For years, I tried to fix myself the only way I knew how   
by consuming information.

Books.  
Courses.  
Mentors.  
Productivity systems.  
Motivation.

110 books.  
84 courses.

Each one felt like a promise: *this will complete the puzzle.*

Still, every night felt unfinished.

Then one night —  
1 AM.  
Black coffee.  
Silence.

A lesson from my engineering days resurfaced:

*The effectiveness of any system depends on its entropy.*

I froze.

Because suddenly it was obvious —  
I had spent years learning to design systems,  
but the best system I could engineer was **myself**.

My entropy wasn’t physics.

 It was scrolling.  
 It was pleasure seeking mind.  
 It was WhatsApp memes.  
 It was music blasting to kill silence.

So I didn’t add anything.

I removed.

No YouTube.  
No social media.  
No WhatsApp.  
No music.

Day 365 felt quiet.

Not peaceful.  
Quiet.

I called it precision.

i’ve been thinking a lot lately about how to look cuter at work. we have a very small but adorable coffee shop and a lot of customers seem drawn to it more for the aesthetics than the actual drinks. in the past i’ve always worn my longish hair up either in braids, ponytails, claw clips, buns, etc. for convenience and hygienes sake, but lately i’ve been thinking about trying to wear it down! i do have accessories such as headbands, barrettes, etc, that only really look good when my hair is down.

I wanted to check with y’all for feedback about hair styles. how do you wear yours? if you came into a coffee shop and the barista DID have their hair down, would you judge them? has anyone had issues with their hair? ending up in food/drink? overstimulating? overheating you? ending up gross and dirty by the end of the day?

I’d love some to hear both from a customer AND a barista perspective about this! feedback would be much appreciated!!

1ps5am2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1ps5am2/mil_too_its_blown_up_and_we_need_advice_please/,MIL too?! It's blown up and we need advice please,"Reported after format problem cut it. 

Sorry, this will be long but I feel some relevant back story is needed for context. We need advice, guidance, solidarity.... I don't know. It's a new situation I've found myself in that's similar but different to the history of NPD I've known from my own NM. With Xmas a few days away, it can either kick off again, or rug sweep, or whatever other way and I need to know my / our new boundaries is right. 


Usually I read and lurk. It's helped immensely over the years. But a recent situation with the in laws has me and husband (HB) wondering wtf.


My mother is uNPD, and around 10-12 years ago it was suggested BPD (more histonic, but definitely Queen/Waif). My grandmother seems along those lines. I've been NC with NM for 3 years now. Middle sibling is NC with NM too for several years, youngest is low contact. We seem the rarer kind of just ignored of NC. There's no chasing, no forced monkeys, nothing. 



The players who I'll keep vague-ish are myself (hitting 40). Husband (HB, late 30s, got together 15 yrs ish, married 13, separated but cohabiting since beginning of year). I have my eldest, now adult, then together there is two under five (Little 1 and Little 2). 
There's his parents, FIL and MIL (early 60s) separated well over 20 years but very close, daily talks, frequent holidays, visits etc. SIL 1 is couple years older than HB. Has a near adult child. SIL 2 adult, 10-15 yrs junior from MIL second / current marriage. 


Before we got together he'd only ever see MIL at Xmas or if they did a family occasion. After we lived together and before we had Littles, MIL would drive past our home to visit SIL 1 and or FIL and just not stop to say hi. We lived several streets away from both, in the middle of their homes. Didn't bother him but he said he was used to it. Then Little 1 came and it went from seeing the females of the family 4-6 times a year at most instead of maybe 2 times. 

Then HB changed. He started displaying behavior that reminded me of my NM. Selfishness. Always the victim. Shift blaming and gas lighting. He would instantly go into defence mode and react. By then I had already fallen pregnant with Little 2. I was still dealing with my NM at this point. I am the eldest. The therapist. The scapegoat. The one who parented my siblings and her. The straw was an ""accident"" that caused Little 1 a known allergy reaction and a comment on the cause of a certain SEN - she didn't even bother with a ""not X/eldest"" to bait a reaction. I texted saying I had too much going on and needed distance, including from her. End 2023.

Little 2 born. (All healthy and fine now). HB gets worse. SiL 1 keeps saying I should be open and honest with her about it and kept saying I'm ""family"". So beginning of 2024 I do, I text somewhat frequently and at times she speaks with him. He starts therapy. We all try to find the cause in this switch. He would see it afterwards but just react the moment anything would push him into defence mode. I told him I wouldn't have it around the children so he needed to figure out where and why this was coming from as it was only towards me.


 A few times during 2023/2024, MIL would offer to come or meet up, and it got to the point he'd say *I* would be uncomfortable with it, or I wouldn't want to etc. I was never asked and actually pushed him to go mingle with family and friends. He never had a close relationship with MIL/SIL and he certainly didn't want one now. In Laws always seemed to have the family trait of rug sweeping, avoiding conflict, etc but instead of just saying he didn't want to, my name was dropped. Afterwards he'd always tell them I didn't say that and he doesn't know why he said that.  

On having Little 2 and this behaviour, at the end of 2023 I drop the rope of taking his responsibilities re In Laws. Birthdays, Xmas, etc I now had two littles with health needs, my own auto immune condition flared (we now know a second started). I wouldnt chase contact. I wouldn't be the responsible one for his side for it. I wouldnt buy and make hampers and go buy and drop off cakes. If I'm picking up his slack at home he could deal with his own family. I didn't have capacity to. I'd still be me and interact, attend, talk but my mental load was full. I had just gone no contact with NM and needed to deal. He was fine with this and of course meant it never happened lol. 


End of 2024 MIL came for a chat we requested, which I think was the total of third and last visit for 2024. All three sat and I went through his behavior he had already told her. I asked if there was signs of some kind of neurodivergence as a child, maybe that's something we can look into. I wanted to talk to her as I did not accept this behaviour for myself especially for my children, we both wanted to see if there was a reason why, apparently. Yes some looked like NM sliver but my ND eldest can come across the same and maybe the responsibility of having to grow up now he had two littles kids meant the masking stopped? I just wanted to see if this was a life thing or a recent thing. 


She said no nothing, he was just like her, crap with money, hates feeling bad. (Side info, late 2018 me and HB had a tragic situation out of our control.) Then she said that where I had a trauma childhood (she doesn't know the half of it so wtf), I have a ""thicker skin"" whereas HB didn't so the 2018 event was harder on him, he didn't get enough help (neither did really) and when Little 2 was born it set it off. I just said ""right."". She would always excuse it so just accepted and stopped. He scrolled the whole time two feet away. We had a discussion after how the whole purpose was to talk to his mum and he didn't bother. That id tried. It started before Little 2, they knew this. I was upset as he let her use that as an excuse and not take accountability or remind her it started before. He didn't want to upset her to her face. So he let her. I said he needed to get more therapy and as far as I was concerned I wanted to separate. 

I later found out in a conversation about a visit shortly after that where he said I'd be uncomfortable due to her comment of excusing his behaviour what happened to us in 2018. That caused an argument. He said he didn't understand why he said it as he knew it wasn't true and would tell MIL this, but she was upset and kept asking so he agreed.


New years I found the truth. For many years he had an online addiction that escalated to dating sites. I told him I knew. The dates on sites visits matched to events of behaviour. And it started before 2018 so that as I thought, it all had *nothing* to do with it. We talked. Alot. He said he felt shame. I said he knew this all along and hadn't been honest with anyone, not me, them or therapists. How did he expect to address something he hid? He signed up for specific therapy. I told SIL 1 with proof. I told her she deserved to know as did his mother. That I told him he should meet them for coffee as to allow them to believe excuses when he knew the truth, wasn't fair and the first step in any progress is being honest and taking accountability. I told her I had left the ""family chat"" as I had already withdrawn socially the past year due to everything and now we were separated, he needed to explain things. Not me feeling uncomfortable when I'm asked if I'm good and I say no. I won't and can't pretend, I'm dropping the rope, he can deal with his family but I wasn't stepping away just back. He can explain why we are separated now if anyone asks, his family, his responsibility. Like me with mine. She said she understood. That was Jan 2025. 


I had slowed contact with SIL mid 2024 and stopped end 2024, it felt like she would wave her finger and tut to the behaviour and or him but nothing actually meaningful. There was no coffee meets, no visits, no help with talking to either really, very surface level. In Feb 2014 Little 1 needed urgent medical so she came at 10pm to sit with other so we could take her in until 6am I think. I don't think we actually saw her at all for 2024 after that. 

Noone wanted to visit despite many offers, none wanted to actually do as they said they would by being closer to him us or our kids. So after Jan 2025 I just haven't reached out to any of them. I told him he needed to meet them and be honest but I was done. He can deal with visits, contact etc.


Between Dec 24 and Feb 25, In calls to arrange, MIL would again bring up whether I'd be comfortable with her coming and every time he'd say he has already explained many times she did not make me uncomfortable, I had no problem with any of them nor anyone coming, I've always encouraged it due to lack of grandparents my side. (I would bite my tongue if/when something happens/said or the huge difference in treatment to him/our kids as I didn't want to be the problem when he was the one most hurt. 

After new year, He said he understands and agrees why, and will try to meet his mum for coffee as he agrees anything like that should not be round Littles. A full cards on table of his online addiction causing his poor behaviour and either lying, glossing over or just flat out scapegoating me to MIL so he wasn't ""the bad guy"" to her. 


Feb 2025 he met MIL. After he started to tell her, she said SIL already told her. She praises his honesty and she wants to be a bigger part of his life and to help. She asked if I was still uncomfortable with the excuse she gave for him Nov 2024. He said he told her several times before then she didn't, explained I was upset with him when especially now it's proven it had nothing to do with it. He told me he had to say a couple of times I have never and don't hold ill will towards her and reiterated how it was him that caused it by feeling on the spot, worried about upsetting her so used me as the excuse and he apologised again, asking if she finally understands and will stop asking. She says yes. He said if at any point she wants to talk to me about it, the separation, etc then not around the kids. It has to be when the kids are not around so if we went for coffee or something. She said she understands and agrees that's best for them. (Remember this part).

Weeks later we were told that after that coffee meet, days later she had to be rushed to hospital as she thought she was having a heart attack. Bad knees (hence excitable big dogs not good). She doesn't like to drive past lunchtime as it gets busy hence any visits were always mid morning and short and needed to be planned. (Works shifts and travels ok for that). ""Wears her heart on her sleeve"" emotional person. They didn't need to use the words he caused it for it be felt that. It turned out to be her anxiety. He told me how she's always been overly emotional and that's why no one ever wants to upset her for her reaction - I actually said he needs to sit and think of who that reminds him of. Maybe that was an angle to bring up in therapy as a learnt technique to avoid confrontation and accountability. He fully agreed it was possible.

Since then we have had at least 5-6 occasions, as per normal since the littles came, where MIL arranged to visit and then cancels within 24 hrs of coming. The last few she didn't even bother with the excuse to say she was having ""sniffles"" and if he asked if she's ok and she just said yes but plans have changed, last attempt in August. That point he said he can't be bothered with chasing the same treatment of him, me and the kids. 

Side note - For years when she would come or when he would speak to SIL or MIL, or we met at Xmas, a day out, a visit, a meet was offered for largely me but sometimes all of us to join. He / I agreed it would be fun. He'd then see on social media it went ahead without us/me. It didn't bother me (remember I'm ""thick skinned"" 🙄) but it upset him. He told MIL once or twice on the next offer this but nothing changed. He never understood why not only he wasn't treated differently to siblings but me and our children too. He and I had noticed a switch in 2024 towards me beginning of 2024 where on the odd occasion his mum would visit, I'd start talking and she would just turn to him and start a different conversation looking back this is when I then became his reason. Still no excuse. 

FIL still dropped by randomly through out the year. Nothing was ever brought up but they all just avoid creating conflict or upset. We cohabited and yes a shoddy husband but Littles needs just can't be done by one person all the time and he's a good father. The cause coming to light has meant real work started and change happens. We worked well together for over a decade and have this year focusing on kids first. This year he has learnt alot. Grown a lot. He also recognised he was acting like a mix of my own mother and his. This year has been calmer with shared goals, there's been no online searching of ego boosting validation from others (I did check randomly). With visits from FIL (no one else bothers) we appear normal. We weren't touchy before so on the outside it hasn't changed that much, but I found my strength, my voice and myself this year. So ie spoiler alert - no ""problems at home"" and certainly, none that was told or seen of to/by any In Law they haven't been here lol. 

But apart from a fleeting passing by stop while FIL drove spring time, that's it for this year of me or kids seeing SIL 1 since Feb 2024, contact since Jan. That and a funeral late Spring for HB. No other contact. MIL been here once in summer (plus last month) since Nov last year. Last month was the first time I spoke to her since Nov 2024. He hasn't spoken to them really since Feb unless it was MIL arranging/canceling. If FIL had been told, his visits weren't any different. But both of us noticed a switch around May time. He would only talk family personal or financial with HB when I left the room or they were alone otherwise it felt very surface like I was an outsider. So we believed he had been told and I said to HB that's fine. It's ok if they don't expect us to remain open between ourselves despite the closer of his parents. We'd probably get the same from everyone as that's normal after separation. 


End August 2025 FIL comes as he received a midnight text from NM. First type of any contact to or for/against me since NC started. She said she had learnt we had had another baby (she knew three years prior, I told her and along the way, had minimal knowledge via sibling). She said I cut contact as she went on holiday (she wen on several every year so why would that matter lol). She wanted FIL to ""ask HB why she hasn't held baby. Why. "" I told him to ignore it. By that point she would've been at least 2-3 cans in and probably someone at work had a kid and she needed someone to feel sorry for her. We all three agreed we knew it was lies, exaggeration, being a victim and wanting sympathy. She was just trying to triangulate me and even HB now from his dad. I thanked him to telling us and giving us all a laugh. HB asked if she had messaged MIL too and he said as far as he knew, no. 

Now bare in mind that several times throughout the year, every year, he sends everyone his shift pattern. 

*Beginning of the End*
End October MIL and FIL suddenly turns up to bring Little 1 gifts. I had the dogs in the utility, all the toys and lounge stuff in the kitchen and the lounge floor pulled up, half way through laying the underlay. Dogs start going mad (young and excitable), Little 1 does the normal shy hide and quiet, Little 2 goes running round the room excited. Chaos. All later heard by HB on the doorbell camera. They say ""not a good time? Haha"" and I say no not really. I'm told they won't be long. I had to move part of the new flooring to part open the door, FIL had to squeeze through, move more to open etc all while the dogs busted into and through the kitchen, then into lounge all excited and FIL gets mad, I'm losing my shizzle trying to control everything. I had to get eldest to come down and go sit in the garden with the dogs (Which is also unfair). 

At the start, end and twice in-between MIL asked if me and her were ok, was I mad at her, did she upset me. The first time I said no, like he told you back in Feb your comment didn't upset me. Him sitting there scrolling looking at sites he has since well before *2018* allowing you to think that, upset me. Then the next Are we ok, etc I said like I said, yes. If I had a problem with something you said, I would've told you. Being separated, what he did, then all came and I tried to it vague and quiet as I don't want that spoken around Littles, saying she needs to talk to him about it, and changing the subject. She says we should go meet for coffee sometime and I said I'd only do it with him there, it's his thing, and if she wants information about before during or after it should be from him. How the incidents above contributed to this and that way we are all on the same page, and then joked how meets never happen so she shouldn't worry if her and I don't. Looking back I was never actually asked how I was, how I felt, nothing. 

They leave and HB had texted ""mum and dad are on their way I saw it too late"". Yea. We had talks once home in how what used to hurt was his lack of trying. He didn't attempt to reply and say no I'm at work, no it's not a good time, no the new flooring is being laid, etc. It took a few days and he had to find external validation elsewhere that sending a text to both asking for them to please ensure he is home before coming as he saw and heard how chaotic it was, two young dogs, young kids, is alot for one person which his dad has seen every visit how excitable the dogs are to see him. It's too much for me. And tbh half the time FIL randomly turns up, especially since May, he's then surprised when I say HB at work, talks surface for a bit then leaves. 

After a few days of him mulling it over, reading up how it's perfectly ok, acceptable, reasonable and normal a ask or expectation. He texts both, says he saw and heard on the door cam how chaotic again it was unprepared, and is sorry he didn't try to stop them as it wasn't a good time. Could they please make sure he is home before coming as it's too much for one person. They saw how excitable they all get again, and if they're coming to see him, then to please check first. The first time he's ever really stood for us, like try a reasonable request/boundary.

Week or so into Nov, MIL texts him for our anniversary. He light heartedly reminds her he told her back in Feb we separated but thanks anyway. She responds that she wants to ""meet for coffee, she wants him to let her in , to talk to her"". This upset him as he did that Feb, and seemingly nothing changed or was remembered. He has never been a coffee meet person, he's never had that type of relationship (despite trying) with any of MIL/SILs. They do it frequently, talk daily, holidays, with and without FIL etc. He used to put it down to ""girls day/trip, SILs just closer"" and once Littles came and the difference in treated between nibling and ours, hurt him. It wasn't a girls together thing. Just him. Then his wife. Then his kids. We accepted it and moved on. He tried Feb and now he doesn't want some one on one, spilling his heart to then be ignored, arranged and cancelled on, kids seen 1-3 times a year but there's no interest in any of our lives and he's past it. And I don't blame him. 

Then FIL texts somewhat passive aggressively asking if he can come on X day to bring Little 2 gifts. HB says yes X is good. Visit happens, was just FIL that came and he brings MIL gifts with him. HB says oh, ok. Nothing is said and it seems somewhat normal after that. It's normal for her to bail for and on any reason to visit him/us/kids.

Nearing two weeks ago now, MIL texts him one evening. She still wants to meet for coffee. He replies between work and appointments he's been busy, he's only day off was the next day and he has things arranged he can't cancel so he can't. She asks if she should pass the kids Xmas presents to FIL and he replied that she should come with dad. She responds with a photo of a Xmas decoration he made when he was 6 or 7. He showed me and said he sees it. That it was like a play out of similar stories we had both read on subs like this. Was it for guilt and sympathy for him saying he wouldn't cancel his appointments less that 24hrs prior? I dunno. My NM never had done that as nothing was ever worth saving if it didn't benefit her. She had and has nothing of any of us. It was weird seeing it with our own eyes. He has started reading more himself to see if she too may be npd as we only had experience of my NM who is different, she's Queen, self serving Waif, vicious. So this was new. 

The next day, mid morning he goes silent. Texting away. SIL 1 has started sending texts attacking, name calling, and it's just texts/responses saying he should be ashamed, he has ignored his mum for weeks, that they ""all stood by you AND *WIFE* since the start of that relationship"". He replied saying where is this coming from as this ain't just not wanting to cancel to meet to talk about his separation, again, on his one day off. But it's just the same. He says all he asked for was to check he's home and couldn't cancel stuff on his one day off, and now all this. It didn't make sense. 


She continued and said if we were separated then his family deserved to have been told (they were, to their face and text several times). If we were then he should NOT be living here (why? It's ok for his parents to holiday together when divorced and she's remarried, frequent contact, family holidays, family days out (all without him/us) but he can't live with his two young being assessed kids?). Him and I are XYZ for how we have treated his parents. How dare we ""dictate when someone can come to our house. How dare ignore MIL for weeks, if ore both mum and dad and ill treat them all year. Disgusting the upset we've caused them all year"" that he makes it seem like he's a pushover and I'm his puppet master. How dare he. How dare I. - every text had something about me. Like honestly wtf?. You'd think he had chosen to date some felon. Stand by me, by us? What?! Like where on earth was all this coming from. But apparently his mum was spending the morning crying on their shoulders, again, about being ignored, not involved, I'll treated and not allowed to be part of her grandkids and yet they've ""stood by him being with me"". What. The. F. We were both so confused and ill give him his dues, he handled and responded well. Calm. Didn't argue. I later saw it all. 

He had SIL 2 message saying she didn't want to get involved but with how upset mum was, she knows he has problems at home but he needs to sort his ####. He doesn't respond to that. 

He ends the texting with SIL 1 again asking what this really is about and what she means. He sent screenshots of last and this month of work. Proof of appointments. Basically tried defending himself and said for my name to be brought straight in then she needs to explain wtf. I had nothing to do with whether he cancels his appointment to meet his mum for coffee on his day off. I never have. And to say from the start is weird. Thats 15 years. She doesn't address any of it except I'm either typing, telling him what to say if so ""hi (my name!"". But ""they've stood by us, he isn't getting pity and to sort his ###. ""

He was so confused. It's the first time it's blown up like this. I looked at the texts and he responded calmly, he didn't name call, argue, accuse etc so the therapy and reading is doing something. Normally he'd just be so sad he might have upset his mum even minimally, he'd cave, apologise, before he did anything etc. But he literally did nothing wrong. He said he couldn't cancel his appointment and it was the only day off for like two weeks. And I told him that. 

He took time to try to write ""with love and respect, What's going on?"" Message to his mum. He says he has received nasty texts, texts that are wrong about his home life, accusing him and me of upsetting her, and how SIL kept talking about standing by us and he is asking, with love and respect, where this is coming from as this is not about him being busy on his one day off to talk about his separation and behaviour again. 

His mum replied saying she is very upset and offended that he said she didn't love me/wife (he didn't say that?), that she does NOT want to know his dirty laundry (but that was the whole reason she wanted the meet?) and all she wants is to be involved in his and the children's lives (she wanted to him and him alone? He's 99% said yes to arranged visits from her as he knows she cancels either day of or the night before. It always been like that). 


The next morning the nibling then messages him. ""I won't argue and call names, you probably don't have my number or will reply, I don't know what's going on but xyz"". Now, my NM? Never in a million years would she talk to my or siblings older kids. Never get them to text someone. She might be ill mentally but she knows our kids are off limits. So that really annoyed and upset both of us. You don't get kids involved. Of course he has her number, they've texted plenty and they are all very vocal and social on the group chat. Makes you wonder what had been said esp when nibling is largely away at college. 

He spent the rest of the day and the next preparing a full cards on the table letter/message, hoping she'd would finally say what is going on. What is it that they've apparently had against me this whole time. He said he wanted to feel heard and if he can learn to be honest, take accountability, and ask the tough questions he might not like the answer to, he needs to finally do the same with his mum. 

However after the nibling text, he said there's no choice, it has to be sent now so he added a paragraph to his text and sent it. I saw it. It was again calm, and said how she kept saying she wants him to be open and honest and this is him coming to his mum to find out what's really causing this. Being too busy to meet for coffee in a matter of weeks when it's not something they do, to end with him being verbally attacked is extreme. To be accused of xyz when it isn't true. He basically goes through all the above concerning him and the In Laws the past year as well as historically. He says the way SIL started and kept on about standing by me ""from the start"" means that there's been hidden feelings and he is asking for clarity. At the start he was renting a room, low pay, etc. I earnt more, I had my own home. But I had a kid, was that it? I had a mum that wasn't the best and I cut contact so was that the reason? 

He has arranged visits and she's cancelled. They never saw each bar 2-3 times a year and he accepted that. He did coffee once and explained we were separated and why back in Feb and he didn't want to do it again when it's so limiting to only mid morning. He cannot do it between shifts. He cannot do that and then go happily to appointments or interact fully with the kids because it's draining. He needs the day to decompress after just like she probably does and he told her he had these appointments for weeks and one day off in this pattern. Something was making them all feel a way and he is coming to her to ask what. 

I had HB include a message from me. I told her this is a repeat of my NPD mother's behavior. I told her if the family is so offended by us co-parenting, they can pay the £650 divorce fee or give him a spare room. I’ve been ""family"" for 15 years, but now they claim they’ve been ""standing by me""? Standing by me for what? Having a son? Being stable? Holding him to account to be better for his kids? They agreed cutting contact with NM was best due to her views and behavior aroundy kids so how is this any different. That's I was never in control of who he saw when and I aint now but I won't ve surprised if he steps back too after their behavior.


He said the fact he himself told her to her face in Feb we were separated, said it again in text on anniversary date, I said in person on surprise visit - she wanted to meet to discuss it as though is was new information, SIL.knew. why say that and for SIL to say he shouldn't live with his children was hurtful and confusing. For her to now say she didn't want to discuss his ""dirty laundry"" was upsetting and now even more confusing with what's happened. It doesn't make sense even more so as that was the whole purpose. He said he knows this would be shared amongst them including FIL and why it addresses all points as he does not know why these things are being said. He ended it by saying that having nibling now message too just confirms this is much deeper than a repeat of Feb, which he didn't want to do anyway, and is unacceptable to not only be attacked, accused, name called, I was too, she wouldn't say why only things untrue so he's asking her where this is rooted from. And now involving and having nibling message proves it runs deep, but isn't right and for some reason has come to the surface now, but he cannot do anything until he knows why. That this is all his words, his feelings, coming with calm, love and respect. But if any of them thought this was the way to resolve any issues any of them feel, even if that hasn't been the case as shown by previous texts, then it hasn't. At all. 


Three days later, his mum texts. Day after that SIL 1. He was back at work so didn't look. He tried to post himself but it wasn't the right sub and got no response so I said I might. Usually I may comment rarely but I don't think I've posted before as I've had forty years to learn and then start to heal from NM. But this? This SO out of my, let alone his, understanding of ... Wtf. But he looked yesterday morning and then told me last night. MIL said it was a lot to take in and she's sorry he feels that way. SIL said she apologised for the way she did it but she stands by everything she said, that she knows I was behind most of those texts, they have all stood by me since the start including during his ""sh@#y behavior” and standa by every word. Neither answered why or where or what. 

Like, is MIL some covert this whole time and it's just been one long dance? Is that how coverts work? NM is uNPD and it's clear (that's a book itself) so I don't know. Since it happened We've been looking back at things with a new lense. It's been eye opening. As it stands his guilt is deep, his sadness about it high but he says he feels relieved he's got things off his chest, lighter.  He wishes it didn't come to this but he doesn't want to contact them right now. He wants them to answer his questions before he'll do any talk, meet and especially before our kids are brought into it as it isn't like they have a relationship with any bar FIL. He says it's not rug sweeping but with Xmas a few days away and work being as busy as it is in this season, he doesn't want to pacify people anymore for peace of others. ""If I have to learn to be better for my children, they should too"". 

Hes heard nothing from his dad. No checking he is ok, nothing to say he's heard what's happened and the hundreds of visits to us this year has not been a problem. Nothing. Silence. And it hurts him deep. He's read about enablers, but it hurts to see that even after nearly three decades after divorce, FIL still chose to not be a part of upset, to agree by submission, than protect one of the kids when something wrong happens which is provable (texts) for a parents' over emotions. HB has said for years FIL has always been like this. But this being so obvious has hurt him. 

I will be showing HB this at some point. He may even reply or feel comfortable posting now or in the future as I keep validating that he hasn't done anything wrong. My mother texted FIL wanting the baby rabies and they agreed that unless you can have a relationship with the parents/s you don't get one with the kids just so you can tell people you're some great nanny and this isn't different just because the players changed. MiL has always made such a song and dance of seeing him yet hardly ever follows through but when he says he can't? This happens. So with Xmas if there is a rug swept request to come see them for visit two of the year for MIL and or SIL, he's going to tell them this. 

Have I just not seen this coming ""from the start""? This is no different to my own family but laced in false niceness. To get involved to the next generation with his nibling is beyond what I feel is acceptable for me. That's wrong. I'm sure I'm not alone hitting this point in my life trying to ensure we don't display behaviour that would leave our kids to become ourselves. Am I / we reading too much into this? 

I've told him after the second time MIL did the whole ""does she hate me"" that he can arrange MIL visits whenever but I go out. I KNOW she's going to bring it up along with what I found. He knew it but hoped she wouldn't. She did. When they knew he wasn't here (his car wasn't here so neither is he). But now? I said I don't want MIL or SIL in my house. And I won't have littles taken there. If someone can't treat all three kids the same they can't access any. If my sibling wanted to take little as Nnan keeps wanting to meet them ""before she dies"" or NM, he'd have a problem with that, with them being used to placate people who treat me bad, talk badly about me, and they'd see and hear  that. If anyone adult wants comfort, to talk matters like that and has no problem doing it in front of them then this burden I've somehow been willing no doubt be vocal now too. 

His dad? We don't know what to expect. He may text to come. He may drop off gifts. He may try to play it normal and invite him/us or just him and littles to boxing day. He may just continue to stand behind them and give silence until they get HB bowing to apologise for something we don't know. And he doesn't know how to approach those.

Ah, nothing says “ Serie A commitment” like playing a crucial 24th-round match in Perth, Australia—because why not? AC Milan and Como are locked in a bureaucratic tango with the Asian Football Confederation, while Como’s president implores fans to “make a small effort” to fly halfway across the world. Spoiler: The “small effort” involves saving for a passport, a suitcase, and maybe a small kidney. Meanwhile, CONI (Italy’s Olympic Committee) is reportedly “perplexed,” which is just a fancy way of saying “we’re all confused and slightly embarrassed.” If this happens, expect a 50/50 crowd of fans and confused locals wondering if it’s a soccer match or a lost *Lord of the Rings* scene.  

**Table Football World Championship: Messina’s Moment to Shine**  
Italy is hosting the World Champions League of *table* football (calcio balilla) in Messina, because apparently, we’re not done with football-related events until we’ve shrunk the pitch to fit a coffee table. Over 500 athletes will battle across 68 tables, competing in categories like “Senior O50” (because aging gracefully is a sport now) and “Wheelchair,” which is a heartwarming first for inclusivity. Sicily, once known for mafia movies and gelato, is now a global hub for… miniature soccer? The economic impact? Unspecified. The media attention? Probably limited to people Googling “what is calcio balilla?” and crying.  

**Transfer Market: More Drama Than a Neapolitan Opera**  
The Italian transfer market update reads like a soap opera written by a spreadsheet. Saval Maddalena’s midfield now includes “Giorgio Munaro” and “Amin Mohammed El Barad,” while Tregnago’s new trio of “Samuele Mattoccia, Manuel Gugole, and Alberto Saggioro” sounds like a group of guys who just want to be best friends. Meanwhile, 2004-born attacker Mattia Chieppe is desperately seeking a club, because nothing says “career revival” like being 21 and still job-hunting. The Faccioli twins’ move to Gargagnago is the most wholesome transfer since breadsticks were invented.  

**Juventus vs. Roma: A Masterclass in “We’ll Win, You’ll Cry”**  
Juventus extended their winning streak to three games by defeating Roma 2-1, because apparently, Roma’s xG of 1.53 is just a suggestion. Lois Openda’s first Serie A goal was a tap-in—because even when you’re not trying, Juventus still wins. Kenan Yildiz, the Swiss Army knife of midfielders, created two chances, won seven duels, and intercepted passes like a detective in a hurry. Roma, meanwhile, registered 14 shots but managed to look less threatening than a toddler with a water gun. Juventus is now “within one point of the top four,” which is code for “we’re still not done flexing.”  

**Serie A’s Apology: DAZN Subs and Free Tickets—Because Nothing Says ‘Sorry’ Like Streaming**  
After 130 fans were detained at Naples Airport due to flight-documentation chaos post-Supercoppa, Serie A issued a statement of “shock” and offered full refunds, a year of DAZN, and a free home game ticket. Because nothing soothes a fan’s trauma like being forced to watch replays of their team’s losses on a streaming service. The League also claims it’s not responsible, which is the same defense used by a toddler who knocked over a tower of blocks. Bonus points for the 11-hour mandatory rest period for flight crew—because nothing says “customer service” like leaving fans stranded while pilots nap.  

**In Summary:**  
Italy’s football world is a chaotic blend of geographical absurdity, table-top sports, and transfer-market melodrama, all held together by Juventus’ relentless winning and Serie A’s ability to turn a simple match into a bureaucratic nightmare. If this were a movie, it’d be titled *“Forza Italia: The Musical.”*",1,1766319240.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False
