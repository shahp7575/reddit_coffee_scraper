1iyob8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/thethickofit/comments/1iyob8c/different_characters_leaving_google_reviews_for/,Different characters leaving Google reviews for Greggs.,"This is in response to a post asking us to write about *anything* but the presidential satsuma. I'm doing my fucking best.

Glenn: 6/10. I popped into this establishment at around 4pm last Wednesday. Asked for a cheese and ham roll to be heated. The very nice young person with eyebrow shrapnel obligingly did so. Although judging by the temperature of the thing when I bit into it, it was heated up on the radiator in the break room, rather than the toaster oven. The cup of tea I ordered with the roll was affordable though tepid as an eskimo's piss. 

Nicola: 3/10 Only went in because my bloody husband polished off the last of the sourdough last night without telling me. I'd have sent Terri from the office, but she's brought me an out of date sandwich twice this week and I'm starting to suspect it's on purpose. So, rather than risk assassination by the warm fruit corner in my desk, I  found myself in here ordering a tuna melt in a baguette. The last time I had a baguette, James and I were in Nice with our horrible kids. Hotel buffets are awkward enough without bringing up the subject of divorce, so I braved the heat-lamp scrambled eggs and apparently five more years of marriage. 

The tuna melt wasn't really my thing. Good coffee though.

Jamie: 1/10 If there's one thing the English can do with maximum competence it's fuck up the working man's lunch in new and innovative ways. No matter that 2pm on a wet Monday afternoon is infamously the most depressing time known to man, this duplicitous den of lies and pastries had the sheer nerve of being 'out of sausage rolls' at lunchtime. The time when a hot morsel of dubious ingredients wrapped in a flakey pastry casing is most in need. 'Oh, but we have other foods available.' Just stop it right now, Sandra. Nobody sane, or even of questionable mental capacity, has ever ventured out of the office, braved the elements, risked the snatching of their phone and the newest Covid varient to arrive at Greggs and buy a custard slice. Greggs knows this. We know this. The fucking man on the moon deep-throating a two-headed martian known this. Sort it out.",2,1740578871.0,thethickofit,0,1.0,False
1iyoas0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaMarzocco/comments/1iyoas0/micra_or_mini/,Micra or Mini,"Alright, here’s my controversial post that I’m sure I’ll get beaten up over. Especially if it makes it into the coffeecirclejerk thread. 

I’m (almost) ready to take the plunge and buy a La Marzocco machine. I’ve almost got enough saved. I’ve spent weeks (months?) researching and reading reviews, trying to decide between the Micra and the Mini. And I’d like your educated opinions ;) I’ll describe my lifestyle/situation below. 

Experience/taste: I’ve been a coffee lover for almost 10 years. I’ve exclusively drank some form of black coffee for the last 7 years. Typically long blacks, with an espresso peppered in. I drink milk drinks (usually flat whites or cortados) on weekends. I’ll only get them when I go to a decent coffee shop who makes a good one. 

Needs: good espresso pull, hot water spout for americanos, good milk frothing. 

Volume: I’ll have 2-3 coffees a day. My partner doesn’t drink coffee (weirdo). More on weekends and we like to entertain ppl who love coffee. 

Current setup: I have a super automatic. I used to have a Breville barista express. Not sure why I went to super but here we are. Everything I’ll need for the new setup will be new (ouch). 

Counter space: both micra and mini will fit, although mini will be tight. But we can make it work. 

Budget: I could go and buy the micra now. If I want the mini I’ll have to keep saving for a few months. But we’re double income, no kids, fairly simple lifestyle. We could make it work. 

Other: I’ve never actually measured the volume of coffee grounds/espresso with a scale, so this will be new to me. Not opposed. But I’m not expert level. 

Reasons why I don’t want the micra: I prefer the all matte black finish of the mini. Worried about cup clearance. Just generally worried I’ll regret getting the micra only because I can afford it NOW instead of waiting. 

Flip side: do I really need the mini? Is the extra $2600CAD worth it and will I get value from it? 

Oh…also. I’ve gone analysis paralysis on grinders. May just get the Pico to keep it simple but open to other suggestions. I’ll already need to buy a scale so I don’t necessarily need a grinder that doses by weight. ",1,1740578833.0,LaMarzocco,0,1.0,False

I’m working on a project to develop an app that helps students and young professionals find the perfect study/work spot outside of home—think coffee shops, libraries, co-working spaces, and more. I’d love to know what features you’d want in this kind of app, and what’s the most important aspect to you when choosing your study/work spot.

Here are a few aspects I’ve thought of:

* How important are things like power outlets and comfortable seating?
* Would it help to have real-time availability or the option to book a seat in advance?
* Would you use user reviews and ratings to decide where to go?
* Do you prefer a map view to find nearby spots?

Feel free to add anything else you think would make this app super useful, or anything you’ve wished for when looking for a place to study/work. Your feedback is super important and will directly help shape the app!

Thanks so much! I can’t wait to hear your ideas!",1,1740578678.0,u_Bubbly_Shake_28,0,1.0,False
1iyo8tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iyo8tl/miserable_experience_with_bookoo_app/,Miserable experience with BooKoo app,"I've been using the BooKoo Themis Mini coffee scale for the past 3 months as a flow rate aware replacement for my Wacaco and MHW-3Bomber scales.  
  
The only reason I bought it was so that I could monitor and \_**record\_** flow rate and there aren't any alternatives that fit Cafelat Robot and cost less than $200 (Acaia Pyxis).

What I didn't expect and what I haven't seen any youtube reviewers mention is just how painfully frustrating the BooKoo app user experience is. (Google Pixel 9 + BooKoo App 2.1.0 + scale firmware 1.0.9)



\- It takes 5 seconds on average to connect to scale;

\- Every third(!!!) or so connection attempt is bugged: the app claims that it's connected, the scale's blue LED is on, however the weight in the app stays on 0 until you reconnect the scale;

\- Front page settings do not persist between app restarts: e.g. disabling the pressure plot and setting a custom weight target have to be done on every app launch again and again;

\- Some errors are not translated from Chinese, and you \_will\_ see them as scale spontaneously disconnects or fails to connect;

\- The app noticeably lags during most simple tasks like switching between tabs or menus and sometimes permanently freezes, and it has nothing to do with my phone's performance;

\- It's impossible to disable the pressure axis and pressure plot can be hidden only temporarily. If you don't own BooKoo's smart pressure gauge you will still have to see all its related UI elements on the frontpage;

\- The quality of the app in general is underwhelming - it feels like it was never fully tested. Settings menu is called ""Setting""; the Basic tab screen of Settings is not scrollable so you have to fold some of the categories in order to see the bottom entries; the bottom label of the diagram in History menu is cut off by the phone screen; the scale charge level displayed on front page sometimes at random decides to show a lightning icon instead, etc. etc.",1,1740578673.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1iyo6uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1iyo6uz/moved_in_72_hours_ago_and_my_neighbor_attempted/,Moved in 72 hours ago and my neighbor attempted to confront us about parking?,"Husband and I relocated to Oregon over the weekend and couldn’t be more excited about living in a kid friendly neighborhood. I’m 6 months pregnant and we have a 1 year old, so we upgraded to a 3 bedroom. 

We moved into a small apartment building that the landlord advertised to have a parking lot (it does) and no assigned parking because there’s ample street parking when parking isn’t available in the building (which we’re cool with). The landlord also said a few of the tenants don’t have cars so parking should really be a non issue. 

A neighbor approached my husband yesterday while he was outside and basically said “hey, know you just got here and there’s not technically assigned parking, but the neighbors have a way we’ve been doing things. I’ll write up something explaining the parking.” He mentioned she seemed extremely anxious/skittish while trying to broach the topic. Unsure if this was general conflict anxiety or if it’s because we’re the only black neighbors in the building. We live in an area that’s probably 90% white, for context. 

She also mentioned something about her sister living in the building who doesn’t have a car, so what I think is being implied is her and her husband are using those two spots between the two apartments. She was very all over the place in the convo and indirect (again, she seemed extremely nervous) so it was hard to piece together. 

I can’t imagine what the issue is unless they’re planning on asking us to always park 1 of our two cars on the street instead of using the first come first served model the landlord advertised to us. 

To me, a note feels like - I’m telling you what we’re doing so you can comply - vs a conversation about what makes sense based on the current scenario where questions and color can be added into the discussion. She stopped my husband and not me, and he was just like “ok?” whereas I would’ve invited her over for coffee to discuss. But again, this neighbor seems very anxious so idk that she actually wants to have a convo so much as to have us fall in line with their pre-existing agreement. 

Thoughts on approach for this? I was thinking of returning the note unopened and letting her know a conversation would be preferred. Because truly, I want to understand if she’s about to suggest we park on the street at all times so she and her husband can continue parking in the lot at all times, and I can’t know that without asking some questions. I’m pregnant, often carrying a toddler, and we live on the second floor so there’s already a walk up. I don’t want drama with my neighbors but I also don’t even understand why this is a convo when I don’t pay rent to them and was perfectly comfortable with what the landlord advertised.

It was wonderful evening after the few showers was damp. Sunset looked like fire and streets were quiet. One man walked down the street and went to trash, because he needed to get ride of his memorabilia. He smelled fresh air, petrichor and thought about his life now. He was alone, because his girlfriend broke up with him three years ago; she just left without a word. He felt blue, his heart was covering with cracks, but when he gone to the trash he saw miracle girl of his dreams, who had hangover and lied in the trash. She looked sloppy and smelled not very good, but she hooked him up with something.
He went to her and asked:
“Are you okay? Can I help you?”
She answered mumbling:
“Oooh maaan, do you have any water or something like that? I am thirsty, my head is splitting”.
Man said with limerence: “My lady I have everything what you want tea, coffee, water. If you want we can go to my duplex apartment”
She thought that is a good idea and said: “Yes Mr. Gentleman I will go with you. You conquer my heart”.
He took her arm and helped her to stand; when he hold her he felt what his heart almost jumped out of his chest. They both went in his luxury-duplex apartment on the 13 floor. When they entered, the man hung his coat on the coat rack, put his package, he forgot to get rid of it, and started to help the woman to take off her boots, when she was trying to understand that is going on. It was lightly, spacious and cozy flat. There were two bedrooms, one was his own and one was for the guests (maybe?), but this room was idle and abandoned… In living room were with fluffy carpet, sofa, armchair, panoramic windows and warm balcony with unbelievable view of the city. Our character went to the bathroom, took one towel and gave it to her.
“What is it?! I just want to drink something…uuuh my head”
“While you’re taking a shower, I will put the kettle on”
“Okay, you convinced me, but I want something stronger than tea)”
“As you wish, I will find something”
After a time they sit on the kitchen and drink vine, he looked on her and thought that he uniquely saw her once, but cannot remember when and where. In one-moment women said: “Hey, what is in that package?”
“Oh, here is memorabilia; I have been store them too long. Today I wanted to get rise of them, but when I saw you I forgot about it.”
“Can I take a look?”
“Yes”
“I found one letter here, can I read it?”
“Yes, if you what so”
“Are they connected with your girlfriend? Could you tell me more about her?”
“We have been dating each other for 2 years, but in one moment she just left without saying a word. I pulled out all the stops to contact her, but I was being ghosted. I felt short-changed, she backstabbing me. However, over time I forgot her, I blocked my memories and emotions, which connected with her. And just go with the flow.”
“Wait, what’s your name?” 
“Oh, sorry I didn’t introduce myself. My name is Mike”
“What was your ex’s name?”
“Luba”
In that moment the women’s head became clear. A wave of memories washed over her, when she started to read it. It was her letter, she wrote to him, when she first confessed her feelings to him.
“Mike, I need to confess you…I was keeping this secret too long”
“Oh, no, don’t say that you are…”
“Yes I am…Three years ago in summer I did a pregnancy test and it was positive. I was confused, scared. I didn’t want to tell you, because I was afraid what you will be angrier and in that time I didn’t want to take responsibility for it. I ventured to go on abortion. After that, I couldn’t look you in the eye anymore and decided to run as far as I could. That is why I left you. Oh, is weight off one’s shoulders, I needed to vent my thoughts earlier. If you don’t want to see me anymore, will go.”
“Why did you think so? I would never do that to you. I have been waiting you for three year in heart…I don’t want to let you go, don’t let me go again. In that day then you left me I wanted to make an offer to you.”
“Oh, my god, how dump I was…”
He took the ring of wine lid, got down on one knee and said:
“Do you want to be my wife?”

moving on to the cat. my roommate always takes the high road thinking they know just about everything, and criticizes me whenever possible. for example, they are quick to mansplain to e how to make coffee, something i've been doing my whole life, and when they make it it tastes like watery dirt juice. as a virgo (lol) i am NOT the one to be nit-picking. on top of all the other vibes going on here, now you've just started a war. is always thinking they know how to parent my cat. my cat is very very important to me. i am a first-time cat owner (fam had one as a kid, but not me personally) i feel a very strong connection to her, like mother and daughter. i treat her like my own kid. roommate has a fascination with her, but basically still treats her like a cat, if that makes sense. they ""grew up with cats"" but i personally dont see that as any merit to continue doing what they're doing. trilling at her and scratching at her all weird, giving donuts to her to sniff when we shouldnt be teaching her she can eat these type of things, FEEDING her when i didnt ask, giving her her MEDICINE when i didnt ask. she actually did get a cat, one that was hyperactive and rly needed attention and was so so sweet, but gave it up after three days cuz it bit her. she said she ""works too much to have time to correct behavior"". then why'd you get a cat in the first place?? my heart broke seeing him go. i begged and pleaded that i would help. but roommate would not budge. now they are trying to parent MY cat, and i find this unacceptable because im a territorial person. they went into my room last night to take my bong and ashtray and clean them. its like, you think you're helping but you're actually crossing my every boundary, and i shouldnt be having his conversation with you every week!

the kicker, i was specifically told upon moving in with them that they know they can be over-bearing, and to warn them if it was getting to be too much, which i pretty much instantly commented on when they started rearranging (and eating) my food, putting my toiletries and decor wherever they saw fit, etc.

when i confronted them about feeding my cat last night, and the reason being im possessive of my kid, they went in their room and shut the door for like an hour, which is weird cuz they usually watch tv in the living room unless they're sleeping

Scapegoat on both extended families too, and my immediate family with three brothers, and two fucked up parents. I always wanted to go NC. I had a strategic plan to do so when I had financial stability- because I wanted to be 100% certain that I never would have to go back. But I had to leave before I was ready. Get this:

\-I lost my job in NYC. I lost my apartment. I had to move ""temporarily"" back home with my mother and two younger brothers. 

\-Apparently, my mom was selling her house. Her parents have a house nearby that is huge and nice. They stay in florida for winters so they were not there. My mom and brothers started staying here- so they could smoke weed in the house- since they could no longer do it at my mom's house- since people were viewing it to be sold regularly

\-So, I had to bring all my belongings to my grandmoms house. (FYI- parents divorced senior year of HS, moved out of childhood home my first week freshman year away at college 2 hrs away- and each parent got a house with 3 bedrooms for my brothers in each, but nothing for me- and no where to store any belongings)

\-I literally slept in my grandparents bed and stayed in their room or bathroom all day long. I had no car. I was in middle of no where. I just did art in there. Surrounded by all their things. 

\-They tortured me. For instance, stealing pads, refusing to drive me 2 min down the road to get pads, then laughing at me to use my overweight grandmothers diapers instead. When I fought back- my mom would cry and play victim and say I am abusing her for her money? Its pads? Then my little brother would take over and scream in my face and get all close to me to leave my mom alone defending her? As if I was wrong. He would steal my things like coffee in morning, knowing I had no way to get it, no car, trapped there all day. He would then wait and laugh at me to have his phone out to watch me cry to send to everyone. He would play recordings of me crying in living room around his friends while I am nearby to make sure I knew what he was doing 

\-Then, my cousin stopped by to pick up storage from my grandmoms basement unexpectedly. She caught my little bro and all his friends smoking weed down there. She told my grandparents who made my mom leave and my mom had us all go back to her house

\-No one wanted to drive me there so I had to pay my little brother. He did not help me bring my stuff to his car. He then yelled at me on the ride to my moms. He then stopped two blocks away. It was pouring rain. He threw all my belongings on side of road. So I had to one by one, in pouring rain, walk my ruining things into her house. My brother laughed and parked right in the driveway for himself as I was distressed and panicked someone would take my stuff if I didnt rush 

\-my mom was sooooo angry that all my stuff was in her house but I had no choice. She hated me there. I had to stay in unfinished basement on couch. She would smoke weed outside the window with brothers, friends her dealer and talk crap about me knowing that I could hear. She would laugh saying to blow smoke in vent to make me jealous and not give me any? 

\-final straw: little brother and I got in a fight. He recorded me crying. He gave me a black eye. I was done. My mom said she was giving all my ""shit"" away. I left all my belongings behind. I asked her to take me to the train station. She wanted to take me to the ghetto bus station 2 hours away for ""bad guys to get me."" She laughed that I had no money (not even two dollars for train ticket)

\-the entire 5 min ride to train station she ended up driving me to- she was attacking my face and appearance and calling me homeless and laughing in my face. She then dropped me off on the side of the road so I had to walk across a high way to get to train station as she screamed horrible things at me out the window

\-I sat in train station not knowing where to go and only had my phone and a plastic bag and backpack. my brother was calling me a disgrace and not apart of their family and to die. My mom was calling me trash and that she will call the cops on me and frame me for having drugs???? She was saying to go live in garbage with bugs. All after being stuck there no clue where to go. 

\-connecting to the internet, my friend sent me 2 dollars for a train ticket where I went to philly and started couch hopping with friends from college and high school....they helpd me so much

\-I was so unstable I couldnt work. I started applying for benefits, food stamps. My mail would go to my moms and she humiliated me by saying I am abusing the system to family. She stole my mail and took out the EBT card to delay everything. She wanted to sabatoge everything for me. 

\-Where I was staying was in ghetto with no internet, so I had to walk to library to use internet just to apply for benefits each day 

\-Then moved back in with an ex bf, got approved, moved away with a dog, then started working, then moved back to nyc, then started a masters program, and now i graduate this month- 6 years since no contact.

  
I saw google memories with pictures and screenshots from this last day no contact and it breaks my heart.

Pics of the black eye, my grandmoms closet, the trash bags my belongings were in, my backpack on bathroom floor where I would stay. My belognings sitting in the rain when my brother threw them out there. Then there were screenshots of inspirational quotes and things about being alone :( screenshots from PTSD pages. Screenshots of happy scapegoating quotes. Screenshots of train tickets friends would send me. The picture of me in the train station that day in the mirror in bathroom- knowing that I would look back on that day forever. This was the last time I ever saw my family. 

No one asked what happened.

Every extended family member is brainwashed that somehow- I abuse my parents for money. Since they paid for college as per court agreement for their divorce. Out of my hands. That I was abusing her when homeless and lost my job and was just assaulted and broken and just needed a temp place for a few days. No one asked. I was on food stamps, disability, SSI.

1iynxrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LogoMotionGraphics/comments/1iynxrc/how_do_motion_logos_influence_first_impressions/,How do motion logos influence first impressions of a brand?," You ever meet someone who just stands there, blank-faced, offering nothing? That’s a static logo. Now imagine someone strutting in with confidence, shaking your hand, and throwing in a smooth backflip for no reason. That’s a motion logo. Which one are you gonna remember?

See, in the branding world, a motion logo is like the guy who shows up to a party with a light-up suit and a perfectly timed slow-motion walk-in. Meanwhile, a static logo is… well, it's probably standing in the corner hoping someone notices it.

Why Motion Logos Have That ‘Wow’ Factor

A motion logo isn’t just a fancy animation—it’s a brand’s first flex. It tells you,
“Hey, we’re not just another boring company. We’ve got energy, we’ve got style, and we might just make you fall in love with our brand.”

It’s like dating. Imagine swiping through profiles. One person’s profile pic is a blurry selfie from 2012. The next one? A short, dynamic video where they make eye contact, flash a confident smile, and maybe throw in a cool transition. Who are you clicking on? Exactly.

Psychology of Motion: Why Your Brain Loves It

Science backs this up! Our brains are wired to notice movement. That’s why you’ll always turn your head when a squirrel suddenly darts across the road (even if you’re deep in existential thoughts about why you still haven’t learned 3D modeling in Blender).

A motion logo grabs attention, creates emotion, and builds anticipation. It’s the difference between seeing a coffee brand’s still image vs. watching steam rise as the logo smoothly transforms into a perfectly poured latte. Now you’re not just looking at a brand—you’re feeling the experience.

Types of Motion Logos: Choose Your Fighter

1. The Smooth Operator – Slow, sleek, elegant motion. Think luxury watches, high-end cosmetics, or anything that makes you feel like you should be drinking wine at 3 PM.


2. The Energetic Punch – Fast, bold, impactful. Perfect for sports brands, tech startups, and energy drinks that want you to believe you can parkour after one sip.


3. The Quirky Charmer – Playful, unexpected, and fun. Like an animation that winks at you. Think snack brands, toy companies, or that one social media app that’s way too addictive.



Motion Logos: The Ultimate Trust Hack

Ever seen a brand with a smooth motion logo and immediately assumed they knew what they were doing? That’s branding psychology 101. A well-animated logo signals professionalism, innovation, and confidence.

On the flip side, a poorly executed motion logo? That’s like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, but the rabbit is… actually a sock. Not the vibe you want.

The Takeaway: Move It or Lose It

In the end, a motion logo isn’t just about looking cool—it’s about setting the tone for your brand in the first two seconds. If done right, it sticks in people’s minds like a catchy song. If done wrong… well, you might just blend in with the sea of forgettable logos.

So, if your brand’s still rocking a static logo, it might be time for an upgrade. Because in a world full of distractions, standing still is the fastest way to be ignored.

My oldest has hyperactive and my middle has both. We cannot get my middle child to focus for more than literal seconds. He's not struggling in school yet but the teacher has brought up concerns about him having issues in the future as school gets harder. 

I've read a lot about coffee being a natural help with ADHD in some cases. My kids don't drink any caffeine and we've limited red dyes and other things that exacerbate his ADHD. We will also be adding omega 3 and getting his levels checked for other vitamin deficiencies. 

Back to the coffee, we gave him the ounce and he was a completely different kid, read a book with no problem, I could have a conversation with him, his memory improved tenfold. Then 2 hours later went to sleep just fine. 

I've read about side effects and compared it to meds (which I'm just not ready to give him at this time) the main issues are sleeping pattern can get screwed up(time will tell he went to sleep fine 2 hours after drinking it) tummy aches, which meds can do as well, and dependency which is usually caused by the cream and sugars put in the coffee to make it easier to drink (I gave him black coffee and said it's medicine) also the difficulty with dosage which I understand. 

I am not fully against meds but I don't feel comfortable giving them to my 6 year old til he's better at communicating how he's feeling and can articulate what the meds are doing to him. My husband and I were both thinking closer to middle school. 

As of now we are going to try the black coffee. I can't see any real downside to it that isn't also a downside of meds. They seem to have the same negative side effects and coffee is just more natural. 

Hopefully it works well enough for him to stay focused for most of the school day. Has anyone had success with coffee without meds.

1iynuad,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1iynuad/bad_weed_experience/,Bad Weed Experience,"The night before my 16th birthday, my friend and I decided to get really high—not just relaxed, but way too high. Normally, I take small doses of edibles to feel stress-free, but this time was different. This was the first time I’d ever greened out. Bearing in mind the weed wasn’t laced, we have done this multiple times and it’s been perfectly fine. I consumed 0.5g. The strain was Oreoz, and the THC Content = 20%. 
My friend had the exact same amount as me, but is bigger than me and a year older, but he also felt it was very strong, but did not experience anything I did, just a strong high. He doesn’t have any severe situation right now like what I have described below either. Which I believe may make a difference. 

Before taking the edible, I had eaten a pack of Doritos, a Starbucks coffee, and some Haribo Tangfastics. At 7 PM, I consumed a Nutella cracker edible, setting a timer like I always do to track the effects for safety reasons. By 9 PM, I had completely greened out.

During the experience, I saw vivid colours and patterns swirling around. Everything became overwhelming, and I started seeing threats where there weren’t any—even thinking my friend was an enemy at one point, though I knew deep down that wasn’t true. I also had intense flashbacks to past events, both good and bad, and my emotions felt magnified beyond control. Meanwhile, my body felt like it was burning and melting into the sofa.

At some point, I passed out and didn’t wake up until 2 or 3 AM. Walking upstairs felt horrible, like my body was barely functioning, but I eventually made it to bed and slept it off.

The next morning, I still felt completely out of it. Everything was off—even food tasted wrong, like it had gone bad when I knew it hadn’t. But the worst part was that the feeling didn’t go away.

On my birthday, everything felt unreal. I was stuck in a haze—forgetful, slow, and disconnected. Conversations felt weird, like my brain couldn’t keep up. I kept losing track of what I was saying mid-sentence, and even basic tasks felt overwhelming. My close friends knew what had happened because I told them, but no one else at the dinner had any idea.

Now, three or four days later, the brain fog is still awful. I keep forgetting things, which is really messing with me, especially since I have mock exams coming up. I lost my lanyard chain yesterday, which is completely out of character for me, and I even left my AirPods on a chair without realising it until leaving the class.

I feel depersonalised, like I’m not fully present in my own life. I have to double-check that what I’m saying makes sense, and before I can answer the next question, I’ve already forgotten what we were even talking about. My sentences feel disjointed, and everything I do feels incompetent and unproductive. I want to work hard, but I keep getting distracted and forgetting things.

Today, I had an English exam, and I just couldn’t focus. I don’t remember much of it at all. At some point, I went to the toilet, and when I walked back into the exam room, everything just felt wrong—like none of it was real. It was as if everyone around me was fake, like characters in a simulation or a dream. Obviously, I know they’re real, but in that moment, it didn’t feel like it.

I know that this isn’t just about the weed. I have a lot going on right now—serious issues with my mum’s terminal illness that I’m struggling to process, my GCSEs coming up, trying to revise while living at a family member’s house, and my dog not being at home with someone I literally don’t know, which makes it even harder. Everything just feels overwhelming, and this brain fog is making it worse. Usually, before I did this high amount of weed I was just slightly stressed but still able to process everything and work perfectly fine, obviously it was hard, but manageable. I have watched many YouTube videos which has helped but some have said it’s not possible to go back to normal if it’s caused brain damage. 

A couple of friends reassured me that it would pass with time, and I know I’ll never take that much weed again. But right now, I still feel completely off. Has anyone else experienced this? How long did it take to go away, and is there anything I can do to speed up the process?",1,1740577511.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False

1iynt43,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1iynt43/26m_m4f_augusta_georgiaanywhere/,"26M {M4F} Augusta, Georgia/Anywhere","Hey, Reddit. I’m putting myself out there because I’ve recently come out of a relationship that made me realize exactly what I want—I’m looking for something real, long-term, and committed. No games, no situationships, just something built on trust, compatibility, and a shared vision for the future.

There are some pics of me on my profile. If I’m wearing a ring in a couple of months because I am recently divorced.

A little about me:
	•	I’m 26 and based in Augusta, GA.
	•	I have a mix of nerdy and outdoorsy interests—whether it’s deep conversations over coffee, exploring new places, or just chilling with a good book or movie.
	•	Stability and ambition are important to me. I work hard, but I also make time for the people I care about.
	•	I value honesty, loyalty, and someone who genuinely wants to build a life together.
       •    I own my own house and am financially independent.
       •    I want to have a family in the relatively near future (within a year or so) but that’s obviously dependent on many factors.

Politically, I lean heavily toward leftist/socialist ideals. I believe in mutual aid, organized labor, and the abolition of billionaires. I think the world can and should be a better place, and I want a partner who shares that vision, someone who values community, fairness, and working toward a future where people are taken care of instead of exploited. If you consider yourself progressive, anti-capitalist, or just generally aligned with these values, we’ll probably get along well.

What I’m looking for:
	•	Someone emotionally mature and ready for commitment.
	•	A person who can communicate and is open to growth, both individually and together.
	•	A bit of a goofball at times, but also someone who can have deep, meaningful conversations.
	•	Ideally within a reasonable age range (mid-20s to early 30s), but the right connection matters more than a number.

If anything here resonates with you, send me a message! Tell me about yourself, your favorite random fact, or what you’re passionate about—I’d love to hear from you.

Looking forward to seeing where this goes.",1,1740577417.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

It was wonderful evening after the few showers was damp. Sunset looked like fire and streets were quiet. One man walked down the street and went to trash, because he needed to get ride of his memorabilia. He smelled fresh air, petrichor and thought about his life now. He was alone, because his girlfriend broke up with him three years ago; she just left without a word. He felt blue, his heart was covering with cracks, but when he gone to the trash he saw miracle girl of his dreams, who had hangover and lied in the trash. She looked sloppy and smelled not very good, but she hooked him up with something.
He went to her and asked:
“Are you okay? Can I help you?”
She answered mumbling:
“Oooh maaan, do you have any water or something like that? I am thirsty, my head is splitting”.
Man said with limerence: “My lady I have everything what you want tea, coffee, water. If you want we can go to my duplex apartment”
She thought that is a good idea and said: “Yes Mr. Gentleman I will go with you. You conquer my heart”.
He took her arm and helped her to stand; when he hold her he felt what his heart almost jumped out of his chest. They both went in his luxury-duplex apartment on the 13 floor. When they entered, the man hung his coat on the coat rack, put his package, he forgot to get rid of it, and started to help the woman to take off her boots, when she was trying to understand that is going on. It was lightly, spacious and cozy flat. There were two bedrooms, one was his own and one was for the guests (maybe?), but this room was idle and abandoned… In living room were with fluffy carpet, sofa, armchair, panoramic windows and warm balcony with unbelievable view of the city. Our character went to the bathroom, took one towel and gave it to her.
“What is it?! I just want to drink something…uuuh my head”
“While you’re taking a shower, I will put the kettle on”
“Okay, you convinced me, but I want something stronger than tea)”
“As you wish, I will find something”
After a time they sit on the kitchen and drink vine, he looked on her and thought that he uniquely saw her once, but cannot remember when and where. In one-moment women said: “Hey, what is in that package?”
“Oh, here is memorabilia; I have been store them too long. Today I wanted to get rise of them, but when I saw you I forgot about it.”
“Can I take a look?”
“Yes”
“I found one letter here, can I read it?”
“Yes, if you what so”
“Are they connected with your girlfriend? Could you tell me more about her?”
“We have been dating each other for 2 years, but in one moment she just left without saying a word. I pulled out all the stops to contact her, but I was being ghosted. I felt short-changed, she backstabbing me. However, over time I forgot her, I blocked my memories and emotions, which connected with her. And just go with the flow.”
“Wait, what’s your name?” 
“Oh, sorry I didn’t introduce myself. My name is Mike”
“What was your ex’s name?”
“Luba”
In that moment the women’s head became clear. A wave of memories washed over her, when she started to read it. It was her letter, she wrote to him, when she first confessed her feelings to him.
“Mike, I need to confess you…I was keeping this secret too long”
“Oh, no, don’t say that you are…”
“Yes I am…Three years ago in summer I did a pregnancy test and it was positive. I was confused, scared. I didn’t want to tell you, because I was afraid what you will be angrier and in that time I didn’t want to take responsibility for it. I ventured to go on abortion. After that, I couldn’t look you in the eye anymore and decided to run as far as I could. That is why I left you. Oh, is weight off one’s shoulders, I needed to vent my thoughts earlier. If you don’t want to see me anymore, will go.”
“Why did you think so? I would never do that to you. I have been waiting you for three year in heart…I don’t want to let you go, don’t let me go again. In that day then you left me I wanted to make an offer to you.”
“Oh, my god, how dump I was…”
He took the ring of wine lid, got down on one knee and said:
“Do you want to be my wife?”
“Oh, dear…yes, yes and yes!”

Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I (M) am sick of not being able to go a day without having to wash my hair and clean the buildup in the roots. Even if I skip a day, my hair will look like I have not taken a shower in weeks. I have a straight, thin, fine, low porosity hair that get limp and oily quite quickly. I was also diagnosed with Sebderm by a derm, but also another derm told me that I have dry scalp issues so I'm not really sure what condition I have atm. I am thinking about buying a H&S shampoo because I remember it relieving the symptoms better than other shampoos at the time a couple of years ago. I am asking for your recommendations about which one to buy, but would also be open to other suggestions. So, the options are:

1iynros,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1iynros/burning_out_and_stressed_at_the_thought_of_taking/,burning out and stressed at the thought of taking a break,"Hi internet friends. Long time lurker--this is my first real reddit post so it might be rambly and weird and I apologize in advance.

The gist is I'm burning out hard. I feel like I've been slowly burning out since my phase as an overachieving high schooler (I'm in my late 20s, AuDHD and OCD) and I don't know what to do. I desperately need a break from working full time, but I have this looming fear that if I leave my job, I will never be able to find something that pays well that I don't absolutely hate. The fact of the matter is that I like my job, it fits into the corners of my best skills and special interests, but even so it's legitimately painful to work even 40 hours a week. My brain clouds over and I spend hours just trying to force myself to get something done, to the point of having a meltdown several times a week. I can feel my skills regressing and although the people I work with are wonderful and understanding, I constantly feel like I'm not improving at the rate that I need to be to keep chugging along. Even so, I'm using up every ounce of creative juice and energy to do a subpar job.   
  
What I'd really love to do is just work part time at a coffee shop or cafe and spend the rest of my time on creative endeavors that actually feel fulfilling and nourishing, but I'm scared that I won't be able to make enough money to support myself. I have a support system, but not one that makes taking a break from financing my existence possible.  And this just deposits me back in the same cycle of pushing forward in work even though I feel it chipping away at me until I have no space to do anything but sleep and work. 

I feel that part of this is that I'm a relatively recently diagnosed person who has started to unmask, and realizing that the unmasked version of me is less fitting to the work I'm doing than the masked version of me. I want to let the unmasked version of me have some freedom--it feels like I'm shoving my true self down every time I log in to work because that version of me isn't as financially viable as Masked Me. 

I don't know if anyone has been able to make this kind of change gracefully, and maybe I just needed to vent. I feel sick constantly, like I'm some kind of ungrateful and delusional brat and I should just get over it and get back to work. I know in my head that that isn't true--I'm a person with a very real disability, after all--but this situation makes the cruelty I throw at myself all the more hurtful.

If anyone has advice, I'm all ears. If you're just someone going through something similar, know you're not alone. ",1,1740577295.0,AuDHDWomen,0,0.99,False

So, I was getting **frustrated** with the whole process of downloading videos from Redgifs. Copy-pasting links into random sites? **Annoying.** Existing Chrome extensions? **Clunky and slow.**

I just wanted a **simple, smooth, one-click solution.** So I said, **""Screw it, I'll build my own.""**

At first, I made a **20 downloads/day free version** with a **$2 premium option for unlimited downloads**, packed everything up, and submitted it to the **Chrome Web Store** and **Firefox Add-ons Store**…

💥 **Boom, rejected for NSFW content.** (lol?)

Apparently, even though the extension **doesn’t provide NSFW content itself** (it just adds a download button to an existing site), both platforms flagged it as inappropriate. 

I **appealed**, explained that it’s just a tool for a pre-existing site, but… **no luck.** They weren’t having it.

So, instead of fighting a losing battle, I said **""Screw the paywall, Google and Firefox, let's go open source!""**

1iynmcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1iynmcr/static_horror_short_story/,Static (Horror short story),"Note: This is an older story from my short story collection book - Call of the Grave

\*\*\*

The moon loomed overhead, bathing the massive expanse of the forest with its light. The scent of damp grass wafted through the air as fireflies sparkled in the darkness of the forest. Kuntal Mondal, the forest ranger, silently made his way through the forest, his eyes scanning the environment. In one part of the pines and firs, a small clearing could be seen. Within the clearing stood a bunch of weathered tents. They were marred with yellowish stains, while the bonfire beside the tents danced with the breeze.

Kuntal squinted after noticing that many things were scattered around the clearing, including clothes, sticks, beer cans and also, a solitary walkie talkie. He was frustrated with the whole thing. Not only had these people illegally camped in the forest but they had also left a mess. Kuntal took slow, calculated steps towards the walkie talkie, making sure he didn’t make a sound. He pocketed the walkie talkie, hoping that someone could reply from the other end. “Is anyone there?” he said through the device, eyeing the trees around him. He could have sworn that he saw something there. “I repeat, can anyone hear me?”

Suddenly, a Pit Pat echoed from the depths of the forest. Pulling out his handgun, Kuntal jerked himself towards the direction of the sound, expecting someone to lunge out of the depths. Sweat trickled from his forehead as he heard more Pit Pats in front of him. He gasped as a strange figure materialized from the distance.

The creature towered over Kuntal, its massive bulk casting a long, ominous shadow across the clearing. Its body was disproportionately large, with thick, muscular limbs that seemed capable of crushing anything in their path. It crawled on all fours, its limbs all twisted and contorted, while its slimy skin filled the air with a horrid stench. Its massive mouth opened, revealing many protruding, jagged teeth, ready to engulf Kuntal.

He wasted no time before firing his handgun, yelling loudly for help. The creature was taken aback by the gunshots that pierced its body, but it made no signs of retreat.

With no other choice, he took out a flare, lit it with blurring speed, and held it up, his hands trembling. The creature stopped momentarily, recognizing the heat of the flare, but it continued towards Kuntal with a deafening high-pitched scream. Kuntal took a few steps back before throwing the flare directly into the creature’s mouth.

In an instant, the creature’s screams filled the air as it scrambled helplessly all over the place. Kuntal gasped as he saw the belly slowly expanding. Kuntal did not want to experience the sight anymore. He wheeled himself around before running full speed into the forest, not heeding the pain in his hips. He did not know where he was going but as long as he was out of that thing’s reach, it was alright.

As he ran through the forest, avoiding bumping into trees, he heard a deafening explosion from behind which was followed by sounds of many things dropping to the ground, each impact making a gross, slimy sound. Kuntal looked behind him and gagged, the creature had blown up into a thousand pieces, its slimy remains scattered throughout the ground, some even stuck on tree branches. More slime oozed out of the scattered pieces, filling the air with a stench akin to one of rotten eggs. “That thing exploded,” Kuntal said, grossed out by the whole ordeal. He was glad to be alive, for he had only heard stories of other rangers encountering the beast, but he had never faced it himself.

Kalikan Forest was known for stories regarding strange creatures like whatever Kuntal had faced. But skeptics had never believed stuff like this, always countering the tales by questioning the absence of carcasses, photographic evidence, and successful expeditions meant to find these creatures. However, Kuntal knew better, as did the other rangers of the forest. They were well aware that these creatures were intelligent, capable of hiding themselves when necessary. The lack of photographic evidence was mainly due to the fact that no one survived encounters to take pictures, and even if they did, they never returned to share them. Furthermore, if these skeptics denied the existence of these creatures, then nothing could explain the cause of the many disappearances throughout the years. Still, Kuntal had only been here for a week, so encountering something like that put him off quite a bit.

Kuntal had run quite a long distance before he aligned himself with a trail, a mud path leading to a watch-tower in the distance. It loomed over the forest, casting a long shadow across it. This was Tower Moonshine, one of the three ranger towers in Kalikan forest and this one belonged to Kuntal.

He rushed to the watchtower, brushing the sweat off his face before starting to climb the spiraling staircase that led to the viewing deck of the tower. “I have to warn the others,” he thought as he raced through the stairs, his hips begging him to stop. “I should have never gone there alone.”

When he had finally reached the top of the tower, he took in deep breaths, trying to cleanse the memory of what had just happened, his heart pounding on his ribcage. He took a brief rest, letting his hip pain subside before he went into the interior, turning the doorknob with his sweaty palms.

The ceiling lights cast its glow over the room, illuminating it. A small bed was tucked away in one of the corners while a large table was placed on another side. On it lay a computer, a large radio and a coffee machine while many crumpled sheets of paper lay scattered on the floor, mingled with soda cans and water bottles. Kuntal booted up the radio, its static buzzing through the air. “Is anyone there? This is Tower Moonshine, come in,” he began with a shaky voice. “Is anyone there? I got bad news.”

“This is Ranger Tower Riverine. What is the problem Kuntal?” replied a voice through the static. Kuntal let out a sigh, glad that someone had responded. “Mike, the camp I went to search, it was empty,” Kuntal said, recalling the strange sight. “And then, this happened”.

He proceeded to explain the whole encounter with the creature, even recalling the memory caused him to tremble. The other ranger calmly listened till he had finished.

“Are you sure that you have not lost your mind?” Mike said, his voice carrying the tone of worry rather than skepticism. Kuntal answered rather angrily, “No, and if you doubt me then I have wasted your time.” Kuntal was simply frustrated. He feared that nobody would believe him but he had to try.

“Look, I do not doubt you,” Mike said sadly. “I was simply concerned. Plus, we already knew that stuff like this roams around the forest. Now if what you say is true, then we have to warn Pralay. Did you bring any evidence of the fat boy? It will be harder to convince the Pralay without it considering that he’s new.”

“Fat boy? Mike, this is serious!” Kuntal said, his anger rising. “And no, I did not get any evidence. However, I did get a walkie talkie from the campsite.”

“Have you tried to get a reply from the other end?”

“I tried, but that’s when the ‘thing’ stepped in. Let me give it another shot. Hold on.”

Kuntal took out the walkie talkie and said, “If anyone can hear me, please reply! Come in, can anyone hear me?”

Shivers went down Kuntal’s spine as a shaky, gravelly voice came from the talkie, “Hello? Derek, are you there? What the hell happened?”

Kuntal hesitated for a moment before saying, “This is not Derek, we are the forest rangers. Tell us where you are, we saw your bonfire near the camp, but no one was there.”

“Where is Derek? How do we get to the den?”

“Just tell us where you are. We will come and find you. And what is this den?”

“If we knew where we were, we would have got to the den already. Screw you, man. We are going to try to get back to camp.”

“Wait, no! Don’t return to the camp!” Kuntal yelled desperately, but the connection was cut, leaving the room in silence except for the sound of the wind beating at the windows. “Well, that did not go well.”

Mike let out a audible sigh. “I’m gonna warn Pralay, Good night Kuntal.”

“Good night,” Kuntal said grimly, putting his hands over his forehead. He thought that he could have handled that conversation better. Fear crept over him as he retired to sleep. It had been a long day, and despite all of the things that had happened, he quickly broke into a deep slumber.

Dreams swirled in his mind; dreams of a strange creature, akin to the one he had seen before, with the only difference being that the creature was smaller. There were numerous of them, looking towards him curiously. Slowly, they closed in around him leaving him no chance for escape. He let out a scream as the creatures lunged at, tearing him into pieces. He scrambled around, before suddenly, he fell into the void.

Kuntal woke up, realizing that he had fallen into the floor. His heart was beating at a intense speed while his brain was still processing the meaning of the nightmare. The sunlight crept in through the window, grasping Kuntal with his warm hand. Birds chirped noisily outside, mingled with the gentle rustle of leaves. The combined scent of grass and flowers filled his nostrils, immediately easing his heart. Nature was the only thing keeping him going in this strange forest.

The peace was short-lived however, as the radio started to beep. Kuntal rushed to turn it on, filling the air with static. “This is Ranger Tower Moonshine, what is it?” he said, waiting expectantly, but no answer came. “This is Ranger Tower Moonshine, come in.”

“This is Ranger Tower Riverine. Kuntal, what is it? You woke me up, man!”

“No, I did not broadcast the signal, Mike. Was it you, Pralay?”

No answer came. “Come in Ranger Tower Hillside, are you there? Pralay, are you there?” Kuntal said, once again receiving no answer. “If he does not pick up the radio, I will slap him when I see him next time.”

“He’s probably sleeping,” Mike said, laughing at Kuntal’s outburst. “Anyways, did you get anything else out of the walkie talkie?”



“I slept early yesterday,” Kuntal said, shivers going down his spine. He did not want to recall the dream again. “But who was broadcasting to the radio?”

“I Dunno, it probably picked up some random frequency”

Before Kuntal could reply, a shaky and gravelly voice spoke through the radio. “We have found the den, Derek! We stole the ranger’s stuff, and it was enough for supplies and Martin helped us with it. I hope you are hearing this, Derek. Please come to the den quickly, its just beside the river we discussed about in camp. I will leave you a map at this tower if you are lost.”

The connection cut off before anyone could reply, leaving Kuntal to be puzzled. “I have a really bad feeling about this.”

There was a long pause. Kuntal did not like this at all. Not only were these people avoiding them, but they had also apparently stolen supplies from rangers. Mike finally broke the silence and said, “We need to check on Pralay. They said something about stealing stuff from rangers. Meet me at Tower Hillside”

\*\*\*

Later that evening, Kuntal had reached Tower Hillside which was a couple of miles away from his tower. There he met Mike, standing near the staircase leading to the viewing deck. He was looking up at the tower with a gun in his hand. Kuntal took out his own gun before looking up at the tower.

The tower’s light came through the windows, illuminating the surroundings slightly. A bone chilling mist raced through the air, making Kuntal shiver.

“Something isn’t right,” Mike said sniffing at the air. Kuntal had not realized it before, but a horrid smell wafted through the air, resembling the stench of rotten eggs. “Come on, Kuntal. Stay behind me, I don’t want you to get hurt.”

“No, I will lead.” Kuntal objected, but Mike had already started ascending up the stairs. With each step, Kuntal grew increasingly alarmed, tightening his grip on the gun. When they finally reached the viewing deck, Mike stopped Kuntal with his arm stretched out.

“Stay there,” he said before taking slow, deliberate steps towards the open door. Shivers went down Mike’s spine as he looked inside the room. The bed cover was torn apart, with cotton spilling from the pillows. Yellowish stains marred the walls, and the chair lay upturned, one of its legs broken. The tables, usually equipped with radios and a computer, were completely devoid of these things. However, a strange piece of paper lying on the floor caught his attention. “Kuntal! You might want to see this!”

Kuntal gasped entered into the chaotic room and wanted to comment about it, but Mike stopped him and handed him the piece of paper. Kuntal furrowed his brows as he realized that it was a map of the forest, with a particular point near the river marked with a red dot.

“This must be the den that they were talking about,” said Kuntal, stroking his chin, but Mike was concerned about something else. Where was Pralay? Surely, he did not let himself be captured by whoever ravaged the place.

“Pralay must be in that den and so are the thieves,” he said to himself. “Should I really risk going there or just leave it to the authorities?”

“No Mike,” Kuntal replied, shaking his head. “Bringing the authorities into this mess means bringing questions to us. And we already know that they ain’t going to believe a single thing about my story.”

Mike let out a deep sigh before stepping out onto the viewing deck. Suddenly, a small creature, very similar to the one Kuntal had seen before popped out of the shadows, lunging at Mike with terrifying force.

Mike got knocked over, and he started to wrestle with the creature. “SHIT!” Kuntal cried, aiming his gun at the scrambling creature. It was too risky to shoot, he could hurt Mike. “Hold still, Mike!”

The creature enlarged its mouth, revealing the set of jagged teeth, slime oozing out of its body. Kuntal’s heart skipped a beat as he shot at the creature, hoping that it would not hurt Mike.

The bullet found its mark, piercing through the slimy body, yet it seemed relatively unfazed, only giving a glance towards Kuntal. But in that very instant, Mike used all his strength to lift the creature up and drop it onto the ground below. How he managed to lift it up, he did not know himself. It exploded into many pieces on impact, its slimy parts splattered all over the ground. Kuntal let out sigh, relieved to see Mike safe.

Mike snarled as he brushed off the oozy slime off his shirt. “This is a mess. How did it even get up here?” he said, eyeing the creature’s decrepit corpse

“Are you hurt?” Kuntal asked, not heeding Mike’s question.

“No, don’t worry about me Kuntal. We have to find Pralay and see what these fools are up to. We need to investigate that den. It is our duty to save him.”

“No!” Kuntal said, raising his voice. ”Mike, don’t you see how dangerous this is? It will be foolish to even try something like that. Let them be. I am going away from here. I will be giving my resignation tomorrow morning.”

“After all we have been through,” Mike began, clenching his jaw. “You decide to leave me here, alone?”

“Why? Are you not resigning too, Mike? Surely you understand how unsafe this is”

“Yes,” Mike said, glaring at him. “I understand how dangerous this is. But it is our duty to save Pralay, we can’t just leave him out there!”

“We don’t even know if he’s alive, Mike!” Kuntal cried. He did not want to spend a day more in this forest after seeing all these attacks. “Let’s just leave, Mike. Do you remember when we signed up and the employer said that the last rangers only lasted a week? What’s to say that they met the same fate?”

There was a short pause. Mike stared at Kuntal, lowering his brows. “I will go to the den. That’s final.”

Kuntal shook his head slowly. “As your friend, I can’t leave you here. I will come, but if we can’t find Pralay, then we go back immediately.”

“Then let’s begin!” Mike said, starting to descend down the steps.

\*\*\*

The moon was shrouded by dark clouds, thunder reverberating through the air. Small drops of rain showered on the forest, creating many puddles of water throughout the ground. The rain created constant ripples on the river flowing beside the forest while frogs croaked loudly, singing their song.

The rain splattered on Kuntal’s face, brought by the chilly wind. Mike was in front of him, scaling through the environment and getting his feet stuck in the muddy ground. “Damn the rain!” he cried loudly, receiving a angry ‘shush’ from Kuntal. As they got closer, they could see a small opening on the side of a large rock-face sticking out of the ground. Kuntal’s heart fastened its pace as he saw drops of slime dripping from the top of the opening. He wanted to turn back but kept going, led by Mike’s undying fire of determination

Mike entered the cave, while Kuntal followed hesitantly. As soon as he stepped inside, his shoe got stuck in the slimy booze splattered on the floor. He struggled to get it out, eventually leading him to leave the shoe and carry on barefooted. They cautiously moved past the slimy mess before they were greeted by the darkness. Mike took out his flashlight and the the beam of light further into the cave.

Mike narrowed his brows as he the flashlight revealed a long tunnel, with more slime stuck on the ceiling. They barely fit into the tunnel, making their way through it half bent. Kuntal felt the wall closing in on him, tight spaces were not kind to him. His breath felt labored while his ears seemed to catch strange Pit Pat noises mingled with the Drip Drop of water.

As they made their way, the tunnel got increasingly humid with sweat trickling from their faces, their shirts more wet from their sweat than the shower of rain they had been through before. “If Pralay is here,” Kuntal thought. “He won’t be alive”. Kollas looked back at the way he came from and felt a pull towards it, yet he kept going. Suddenly Mike stopped, leading Kuntal to bump into him.

“What is it?” Kuntal whispered, his voice echoing through the air. “Why did you stop?”

Mike turned back, his eyes widened, he held out the badge of Pralay, the embossed copper gleaming under the flashlight’s influence. “He must be here somewhere,” whispered Mike, pocketing the badge. He proceeded to walk through the tunnel, but Kuntal was hesitant. Not only was the tunnel growing increasingly smaller, it was also getting hotter. Still, he went on.

After what felt like hours of stumbling, they finally reached the end. Little did they know that the opening would lead them to the most sinister place imaginable.

Mike swiftly crawled out of the opening, followed by Kuntal. Kuntal panted for a while. It had not been easy, crawling through that tunnel. But instead of inhaling fresh air, a horrid stench greeted him instead. Kuntal stumbled back as he saw what the flashlight illuminated. Dozens, no… hundreds of spherical blobs were clustered throughout the cavern. Slime hung on the ceiling in thin strands, their nets supporting more clustered blobs. Kuntal gasped as he noticed that the blobs housed tiny creatures which were a miniature version of the creatures they had encountered before. Mike simply stood there, frozen in place, with his hand covering his mouth.

“Beautiful, isn’t it?” a familiar voice said. Kuntal and Mike took a few steps back, noticing a young, blonde-haired lady, her voice was the one they heard from the walkie talkie. “So, Derek did not come. It was a shame, really.”

“Who are you?” Mike demanded, his hands near the gun strap. “And what is all of this?” added Kuntal.

“Oh, this?” she said casually, pointing to the clusters of blobs. “Why, they are eggs of course!”

“Eggs? You mean that this is the home to those damn creatures?” Kuntal said, feeling frustrated himself. “And what hand do you have behind all of this? Why did you come here?”

“I thought that was quite clear?” she said, her voice musically toned. “I wanted to visit Derek and all of his friends. So, I set out with a couple of my friends to visit him.”

“Who is Derek?”

“Well that is what saddens me,” she said, her smile turning into a frown. “You killed him. Blew him up with that flare, or atleast that’s what his brothers say.”

Mike and Kuntal stood there, frozen in shock. The silence intensified, the sound of multiple splotchy footsteps reaching their ears. Kuntal’s breath caught in his throat as he saw numerous of the small creatures surround them, their fat, slimy bodies glistening under the flashlight’s influence while their teeth shone brightly.

“No….this can’t be,” Mike stuttered, looking at all of the creatures. “What have you done to Pralay?”

“Oh, Pralay? You mean the ranger? Well he was the payment for Derek’s death. Here he is!”

The creatures brought out a twisted, contorted body with its organs exposed, blood spewing out of the body. The blood mingled with the slime, inflating strange blobs of slime, their cells interchanging with each other to form clusters of blobs. “One death gives the rise to many lives,” the lady said, smiling menacingly.

Kuntal gagged, feeling his heart drum intensely while Mike said, “I feel dizzy”. The creatures ran upto Mike, encircling him completely.. Mike was surrounded by the creatures, as they circled around him with great pace, slowly closing in. Mike was frozen in place only saying, “I feel sick.” .Kuntal let out a horrified yell, as the creatures extended their jaws, tearing Mike apart in a thousand pieces. Hundreds of blobs sprouted out of Mike’s decrepit corpse as tears streamed down Kuntal’s cheek.

“This is where your story ends, ranger. You’re just a pawn in a much bigger game. I’ve been tending to these creatures for years, and they’ll only get stronger. Your role may be over, but you’ll still serve my purpose. You’ll help me spread these mutated creatures far and wide.”

Kuntal yelled desperately, as the creatures closed in upon him bringing him to his demise. And with his death, his story remained unfinished, with no echo of his memory remaining.

That was not everything. The lady collapsed onto the floor, her eyes widened. Hundreds of the tiny creatures tore out of her body, slime oozing out of her nostrils and ears. More creatures came out of Mike’s decrepit corpse. The creatures met in the middle with them rhythmically speaking in a high-pitched voice. They spoke in their own language but I will tell you what they said.

“You have done well,” the group that came out of the lady’s body said to the other group that came out out of Mike’s body. “What was the ranger’s name again? Oh, right Mike. Yes, Mike did well, we controlled his mind just enough to bring the other ranger here. Anyways, once they hire the next ranger, make sure to settle yourselves on one of their minds.”

The other group eyed the lady’s corpse, “We really fooled them. A shame that Derek died before he got to us, but we have avenged him. Soon we will take over the forest, from there we will prosper.”

They proceeded to chant in a chorus, their voices echoing through the air.

Still very sensitive to anxiety,"Hey guys, I haven’t posted for a few weeks, but I’m now at nearly 5 weeks off the Effexor. I was on it for about 15 years but noticed it wasn’t working very well anymore and the side effects seemed to get worse. 

I decided to quit it with the Prozac bridge, just 10mg a day, and then I continued the Prozac on its own for an additional two weeks. I won’t say the process has been easy or fun, but I’m mostly ok. The biggest issue I still struggle with is anxiety. Like even my usual coffee will have me panicky for the entire day. Oddly enough, I always thought I was more depressed than anxious, but I’m now more anxious overall. 

Other than that, I feel mostly ok. I am going to quit caffeine for a bit starting this weekend, and hopefully that helps with the anxiety. I’ll try to respond to any questions you guys have and  update once I get closer to 2 months.

1iynjka,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1iynjka/day_01_what_ive_experienced_so_far/,Day 0-1: what I’ve experienced so far,"Hi all! I just had my first jab last night and wanted to share my experience. 

TL;DR. A bit of pain, almost fainted but didn’t. No major side effects so far

Day 0: Jab around 19:30 (after work). I was definitely nervous and felt like I was going to faint after I did it. I have a history of fainting with blood tests, but never with vaccinations, so I thought I’d be fine with MJ. As soon as I felt the medication go in; I started to feel dizzy and the ear buzzing. Gladly, I could identify the feeling quickly and just sat down, did some breathing and smelled a bit of the alcohol swab until I felt better, which was only a few mins.

I had a bit of pain when injecting and afterwards, but nothing really problematic.

I continued my evening routine as normal and went to bed feeling a strange combination of anxiety and empowerment. I’m not sure if it’s bc this medication is so sensationalised but I don’t ever feel that way when I take any other medication with similar potential side effects… 

My sleep app told me I took around 1h to fall asleep, which normally takes me about 15 mins. I’m not sure if this is MJ-related but thought it was worth noting.

I also noted a stronger urge to pee. I already drink a lot of water and go a lot but somehow felt a bit different…

Day 1: Woke up feeling tired (which is normal for me) and felt hungry as normal. Had normal breakfast (1/3 cup oats, blueberries, hemp protein, almond butter and a splash of honey) and black coffee. 

I felt pretty normal, although maybe like my stomach felt pretty full.

I went for my spin class and felt very energised. Even my instructor noticed. I’m not sure the MJ is working this quickly but again, just noting these things for future me.

I’m wfh today and tomorrow so I remain vigilant of any potential side effects.

Hope your journey is going well today, everybody!

I’m putting myself out there because I’ve recently come out of a relationship that made me realize exactly what I want—I’m looking for something real, long-term, and committed. No games, no situationships, just something built on trust, compatibility, and a shared vision for the future.

A little about me:
	•	I’m 26 and based in Augusta, GA.
	•	I have a mix of nerdy and outdoorsy interests—whether it’s deep conversations over coffee, exploring new places, or just chilling with a good book or movie.
	•	Stability and ambition are important to me. I work hard, but I also make time for the people I care about.
	•	I value honesty, loyalty, and someone who genuinely wants to build a life together.
       •    I own my own house and am financially independent.
       •    I want to have a family in the relatively near future (within a year or so) but that’s obviously dependent on many factors.

Politically, I lean heavily toward leftist/socialist ideals. I believe in mutual aid, organized labor, and the abolition of billionaires. I think the world can and should be a better place, and I want a partner who shares that vision, someone who values community, fairness, and working toward a future where people are taken care of instead of exploited. If you consider yourself progressive, anti-capitalist, or just generally aligned with these values, we’ll probably get along well.

What I’m looking for:
	•	Someone emotionally mature and ready for commitment.
	•	A person who can communicate and is open to growth, both individually and together.
	•	A bit of a goofball at times, but also someone who can have deep, meaningful conversations.
	•	Ideally within a reasonable age range (mid-20s to early 30s), but the right connection matters more than a number.

If anything here resonates with you, send me a message! Tell me about yourself, your favorite random fact, or what you’re passionate about—I’d love to hear from you.

Looking forward to seeing where this goes.",1,1740576546.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1iynhwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/1iynhwj/cape_town_sucks_for_the_average_person_and_im/,Cape Town Sucks for The Average Person and I’m Sick of Everyone Pretending Otherwise,"Cape Town is one of the most frustrating, soulless, and unsustainable cities to live in unless you're in the 1%. Everyone raves about how beautiful it is, but let’s be real, you can’t live in a fucking view. The reality of this city is a housing crisis, a skyrocketing cost of living, and a social scene that feels about as deep as a puddle.
Let’s start with the rental market, where landlords seem to think they’re doing you a favour by charging R15k+ for a 0 bedroom shoebox with peeling paint and mouldy walls. Half the city is struggling to afford a basic place to live while the other half is renting out “luxury apartments” for short-term lets to tourists. And good luck dealing with a landlord when something breaks, they either disappear or act like fixing the plumbing is your personal burden.
And that’s just rent, everything here costs a fortune. Cape Town is marketed as some kind of laid-back paradise, but unless you’re swimming in money, it’s pure financial hell. A basic dinner out? You’re dropping R500 minimum. Groceries? Imported prices for local products. A drink with friends? Hope you enjoy spending a third of your salary on “just a quick catch-up.” It’s no wonder so many people here survive on side hustles or move back in with their parents.
And if you think you’ll find solace in friends, think again. Cape Town is full of superficial social circles,people who don’t want real friendships, just weekend drinking buddies for Instagram stories. It’s all about curating an aesthetic, not actually forming meaningful connections. People here flake, ghost, and move on the second you’re not convenient for them. If you want deep, loyal friendships? Wrong city.
Then there’s the driving. My god, the driving. It’s like half the city never learned basic road rules and the other half actively tries to kill you. Taxi drivers do whatever they want, normal drivers follow no logic, and indicators? Optional, apparently. Every time I get in my car, I accept that someone is going to either cut me off, ignore a red light, or drive like they’re playing GTA on hard mode.
And while all of this is happening, Cape Town is crumbling under its own weight. The amount of shacks and tents popping up in residential areas has exploded, and with that, so has crime and drug use. Entire neighbourhoods are now filled with makeshift shelters, and if you say anything about it, you’re labelled “heartless.” But ignoring the insane levels of poverty, addiction, and crime doesn’t make it go away.
Speaking of crime: I don’t care what the “Cape Town is so much safer than Joburg” crowd says. Crime here is out of control. I’ve had my house broken into three times, once when I was home. I’ve been the victim of an attempted kidnapping. The fact that everyone here just shrugs it off as “part of living in SA” is insane. Gangs run entire communities, police don’t care, and people just move along like this is normal.
And honestly? The extreme wealth inequality in this city makes it unbearable. You’ve got billionaires sipping cocktails in Clifton while families in the Cape Flats live in constant fear of gang violence. You see homeless people everywhere, starving, and struggling, while some tech bro in an R5-million apartment complains about load shedding. The contrast is disgusting.
And before anyone says, “Well, if you hate it, just leave,” I’m working on it. But for now, I just needed to let this out. Cape Town isn’t some utopia: it’s a broken city being held together by overpriced coffee, Instagram aesthetics, and willful ignorance.

1iyn9ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1iyn9ht/confusing_talking_stage_or_whatever_this_was_left/,"Confusing ""talking stage"" or whatever this was, left me feeling a bit confused and pathetic","I (23M) met S (24F) in my master’s program, and she was the one who approached me first. At the time, she had recently gone through a breakup, though she never indicated that she wasn’t open to something new. Our dynamic quickly became playful and close—lots of teasing, deep conversations, and what felt like mutual interest. She often made suggestive jokes, complimented my looks, and we had long late-night chats over texts.

Her behavior also became increasingly hot and cold. One day, she’d go out of her way to start conversations with me, acting friendly and interested. The next, she’d seem distant and reserved, barely acknowledging me. There were moments when it felt like she was still trying to be close to me, but then others where she seemed to be actively pulling away. I couldn’t get a read on what she actually wanted, and it was messing with my head.

One complication in this whole situation was J (30M), another guy in our program, who never seemed to like me. According to S, J had said he liked almost everyone in the program except for me. I barely interacted with him, so I never really knew what his issue was, but it was clear he wasn’t a fan of me, but i noticed that he would keep making subtle digs at me. It was also clear that he was also flirting with S at the same time.

Then, one night at a bar with friends, S sat on J’s lap, which threw me off  but since my intentions were casual it did not bother me a lot but still kinda annoyed me given how he acted towards me.  It felt out of place, considering how she acted around me, but I didn’t dwell on it too much so i just thoght id take the L and not take it personally . Shortly after that night, she sent me a text that felt like a rejection *""I’m a bit too friendly to people sometimes in ways that I don't mean.”*

I took it at face value and assumed that she was no longer interested and decided to persue something with J , so I started treating her purely as a platonic friend. I figured I had misread the situation and that maybe her flirty behavior had just been part of her personality rather than any real interest in me. I backed off and moved on mentally, treating our interactions as purely friendly and started to see her more like a close friend.

Not long after, though, we had a phone call where she talked about how J made a move on her that night which kind of left her feeling disturbed and that she had taken space from him. In the same phone call she randomly told me that she had thought about sleeping with me at one point, that she had a thing for shorter guys {i am below average height} and of {insert my ethnicity, not going to specify but the men are widely seen as very unnattractive},

This completely contradicted what I thought had been a rejection and left me confused. Why say that if she wasn’t interested? I had already started shifting my mindset away from her in a romantic sense, so I just let the comment go, but in hindsight, it feels like it was intentionally meant to mess with my perception of where we stood. For context we were also talking about my insecurities regarding dating  and why J seemd to dislike me so I thought she said this to make me feel better or something as a friend at this point.

Later, we had a text conversation where she clarified that her message hadn’t actually been a rejection. Instead, she claimed she had sent it because she worried that she had come off as too flirty with J and wanted to set boundaries because of that, not because she wasn’t interested in me. This completely upended how I had interpreted the situation. For weeks, I had assumed that she was making it clear that she didn’t see me that way anymore, but now she was suddenly telling me that wasn’t the case. It felt like my instincts had been correct all along, and that there had been something between us, but now there was all this unnecessary confusion.

Shortly after that, we had another phone call where she told me she was “keeping the door closed” between us because she was stressed about people in our program gossiping. This time, I started to get frustrated because it seemed like she was avoiding giving me a real answer. If she was interested but worried about gossip, why not just address it head-on? If she wasn’t interested, why not just say that instead of making it about external circumstances? After this conversation, she became less receptive to me, but she still engaged just enough to keep me uncertain. If she truly wanted to shut things down, she could have just stopped interacting altogether, but she didn’t. She still made an effort to engage with me at times, and while it wasn’t as intense as before, it was still enough to make me question things.

By the end of that month, I had enough of the mixed signals and decided to ghost her to get some clarity as I was starting to have a lot on my plate with uni and work. I figured that if she was really interested, she would reach out but she didnt adress it. But when I was in class with, she continued staring at me in class, occasionally initiating conversations, and going out of her way to intereact with me. If she had truly wanted to close things off, why was she still so fixated on me? It felt like she was trying to keep me in her orbit without actually wanting to be with me.

After about a month of no contact, she randomly reached out :

*""Basically I know we don't really talk anymore (and I completely respect any decision you make in that regard), but I enjoyed discussing stuff with you and there's no bad blood or whatever so I thought I could just say hi and yap. But I don't actually have anything to say so don't worry about that lmao.""*

This message came more than a week before we actually met up for coffee which i proposed as a way to explain to her why i became distiant to her as I felt a little bad for doing so. I also allowed myslef to become a bit hopeful during this period going back to interacting with her in the same way which in hingsight i should have not done.

When we finally met for coffee, she admitted that there had been another guy this entire time. She refused to tell me exactly who he was but implied it was “a bit obvious” and that I had unknowingly interrupted them in group settings. This stood out to me because I had already suspected that someone else might have been in the picture, but I had no idea how long he had been there. I also realized that if she didn’t want to tell me who he was, she probably knew that it would make things even messier. If it was “obvious,” then why not just be upfront about it? Instead, she had spent all this time keeping that information from me while still keeping me close enough to not fully cut me off.  She acknowledged flirting with me but she said she was just flirting with many guys in our program to see what it would be like as she had just gotten out of a relationship.

This whole meeting I reacted emotionally but tried my best to keep my cool, becouse i had been thinking about this a lot for the past months but it was seemingly no big deal to her. She said she mainly liked how close we got and vauled out friendship and some of the things I saw as flirting, like the long phone calls was stuff she did with all her friends with no more alterior intentions.

She also told me that I had always been respectful and even said that I could have yelled at her, but I never did. That part stood out to me because it felt like she was trying to relieve some guilt—like she was acknowledging that she hadn’t handled things well but was also subtly positioning herself as the one who had more control over the situation. I also coulnt shake the feeling that I was just a fallback option while she was chasing this other guy this entire time, when I called her out on this she simply said ""she didnt see it that way"" 

 I also wonder if my inexperience with relationships made me an easier target for mixed signals. More than anything, I just want to make sure I never get into a situation like this again becouse i feel a bit pathetic for putting so much mental weight on something that wasnt even a blip on her radar. I have been loosing sleep and overthinking about this as this situation has brought about a lot of my insecurities and I was almost sure she was intrested but as it turns out it was no big deal for her.",4,1740575775.0,GuyCry,7,1.0,False

Also, I’m finding it funny that I’ve managed to become much more consistent and happy with my steamed milk on the bambino, and while I do much better shots on the $10,000 machine at work, the bambino has absolutely ruined my consistency on getting decent steamed milk off the big machine.

1iyn269,https://www.reddit.com/r/wien/comments/1iyn269/looking_for_new_dnd_friend_to_play_in_online_game/,Looking for new DnD friend to play in Online game (Vienna Based),"Hi,

I (27F) am looking for another player for my ancient-greek themed online DnD game. 

The setting:

* The sun shines strong over **Achaea,** a land of golden olive groves, marble temples, and crystalline springs where the veil between mortal and fey realms is thin. The polis (city-state) of **Nyktaros** serves as a central hub, located on a peninsula of dense forests, scrubland mountains, and surrounded by waters rewarding as they are treacherous. Their rival state is the island **Skaleos,** upon which rumors of piracy and slavers abound. Achaeans worship Greek deities, but it seems in the last months the local pantheon has had trouble protecting their flock…. The land is newly rife with challenge: strange new beasts roam the hills, and the political tensions between city-states bloom red in skirmish. Magic is present but rare, tied to divine blessings or the influence of unknown creatures. And one day, fate falls to you in the form of a braid of silver threads. 
* Basically Witcher 3 meets the Odyssey. 



I (DM) am a historian and naturalist and have fun bringing fantasy realism into my game. We play in a wannabe Matt–Mercer style where character development and RP is more important than dungeon crawl. Nonetheless the game is pretty combat heavy as the heroic setting is… fighting mythic monsters.   

**Why Vienna if it’s an online game?** 

3/5 of us live in the city and I like to be friendly outside the game. Rather than I just... provide this service for a complete stranger 5 hours a week. 

**Who are you and who are you looking for?**

We are 2F 3M\* ages 21-34. So I mildly favor a female player for gender balance but this is not a prerequisite :). I am looking for someone who already knows the rules of DnD5e. We usually play 2-3 fridays in a row at 19:00, then a week off, but we may change the time if something else fits better for everyone.   
Strong English is required but second language is absolutely fine. 

The game is on its 7th session, and we are currently a full caster party. 

So the squishy players would like a tank: a barbarian, paladin, ranger, fighter

**What you can expect:**

1. PM me to introduce yourself 🙂
2. Depending on number of responses, we’ll have a call where I’ll explain what our deal is, and I may ask you to create a 1-3 page backstory afterwards. Including: your Char's origins and culture, formative events, goals/motivations, who do they worship? Are they related to any mythological figures? As well as significant relations to other npcs in your backstory. They may appear.  
3. I’ll add commentary and help give you ideas to weave it into the world. We’ll have a second call/coffee to complete it.

Join time in 1-2 weeks!

Kind regards,  
Kelto

We’ve built an automated workflow that chases down HOAs for documents on behalf of originators—things like condo questionnaires, insurance docs, meeting minutes, etc. It’s a very niche problem, but for those working with condos, it’s a real pain point. We do about $1M in revenue a year, and we also help some FHA-focused clients by retrieving docs from HOAs.

If I gave you a **$50 Starbucks gift card**, would you be willing to hop on a quick call with me and my co-founder to talk about the biggest challenges you face as a branch manager? We’re looking for a **widespread problem** we can solve.

If you don’t care about the coffee but are willing to share your challenges in this thread, that would be just as helpful. Appreciate any insights you can offer!",0,1740574807.0,loanoriginators,3,0.33,False

I love my main job, i work with disabled people and it's perfect in every way except the pay is super shit. So i finally found a position as a barista in a coffee stand. So far the work is chill and i enjoy it. But the barista job only has a 4 person team including me. And in every step of the hiring process i made it very clear that i need to know my shifts ahead and that i can't take on more than 3 weekly. The other people working there are full time employees. That scares me because technically they have the same contract as me. I don't have the capacity to work as much as them, i don't want to compromise my main job. 

Yesterday the boss from the barista job said she might ask me to come in today because she's sick. I assumed if she needed it she would have told me yesterday. She didn't say anything yesterday so i already said yes to a non essential thing with my main job. About an hour ago she called me to ask if i could take the afternoon shift instead of her. I said yes, because it didn't really matter if i came in today at my main job. I am really worried that unless i establish that this cannot be happening and that my priority is my main job, they will keep pushing my boundaries. I don't want to lose the part time position, it's really hard to find any kind of work in my area and i cannot properly support myself with my current pay. So i want to ask what is the best way to go about this? I am not very confrontational and there's a lot on the line for me. ",4,1740574801.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

Bisher habe ich mich zum einen etwas zu den Unternehmen belesen und bin zum Teil aus Überzeugung bei meinen 3 ersten Aktien hängen geblieben und hatte wohl richtig Glück (bisher).
Ich würde das Portfolio mit den Aktien gerne mit 2-3 ETFs erweitern. Ein World Etf dachte ich und dann noch 2 zusätzliche. Damit ich langfristig einen Sparplan einrichten kann.

Habt ihr da vllt Ideen oder Anregungen?

I got in touch with a partner at an MBB a few months ago, and we’ve stayed in touch (an email exchange about once a month). He even introduced me to a recruiter at one of the divisions (not management consulting specifically) because I showed interest in multiple areas. 

1. The firm isn’t hiring management consultants at my level right now but I plan on applying as soon as it opens up. How would you guys go about getting a referral from this person? I’m hesitant to ask for another meeting since I’m sure he’s busy, but it can also feel too direct to ask for a referral over email. 

2. Also, how do you guys like to stay in touch with important people you had coffee chats with? There aren’t many more things I can email him about- I don’t want it to be too forced but I wanna continue chatting too.

My weight stayed the same, which is not great, but not terrible (at least for me). Something weird happened two weeks ago. I've stopped being hungry.

I should eat breakfast at noon, but black coffee and a glass of mineral water were enough. 

Is this a common problem/issue while being on IF?

I've been trying to fix this by exercising and eating better but I usually get tired of it due to my work schedule and noticed that as a self reflex in every photo I take I'm pressing my stomach in as hard as I can or even during waiting lines for instance in coffee shops to hide my shape from others. My belly is an insecurity of mine and I'm always trying to hide it and when the only solution which is exercising is presented I have to put it down due to work or ending my days completely tired without energy to change.

1iymsw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_healthyskinclub/comments/1iymsw3/transforming_workspaces_how_different_industries/,Transforming Workspaces: How Different Industries Maximize Efficiency,"Take a moment and picture your ideal workspace. Is it a sleek corporate office with floor-to-ceiling windows? A buzzing café with the aroma of fresh coffee? A spacious warehouse filled with tools and machinery? Whatever you imagined, one thing is certain: the right working environment is crucial to success, no matter the industry. Let's explore how different workspaces shape productivity, creativity, and efficiency across various fields.

# Corporate & Tech: Where Collaboration Meets Innovation

For tech companies and corporate businesses, the workspace is more than just desks and computers—it’s a hub of collaboration. Open offices, co-working spaces, and conference rooms encourage teamwork and quick idea exchange. Many tech giants incorporate nap pods, game rooms, and flexible seating to keep employees refreshed and creative.

# Healthcare: Functionality Meets Comfort

Hospitals, clinics, and medical offices need to balance efficiency with comfort. Well-designed workspaces in healthcare ensure doctors and nurses have quick access to supplies, patient records, and consultation areas. At the same time, warm lighting, comfortable waiting areas, and private consultation rooms help ease patient anxiety.

# Manufacturing & Industrial: Safety and Workflow Efficiency

Factories and warehouses require a workspace that prioritizes safety and streamlined workflow. Open floor plans, designated zones for different tasks, and proper ventilation ensure both productivity and worker well-being. Ergonomic workstations also play a key role in reducing injuries and increasing efficiency.

# Creative Industries: Inspiring Innovation

Artists, designers, and writers thrive in spaces that fuel imagination. Many creative professionals prefer open studios, shared workspaces, or cozy home offices filled with natural light, colorful decor, and inspiring artwork. The flexibility to personalize their work environment enhances motivation and artistic output.

# Education: Spaces that Foster Learning

From classrooms to research labs, educators and students need spaces that encourage focus and engagement. Modern schools incorporate flexible seating, interactive whiteboards, and breakout zones for group work, making learning more dynamic and enjoyable.

# Retail & Hospitality: Customer Experience is Key

For retail and hospitality businesses, the workspace isn't just for employees—it directly impacts customers. Thoughtfully designed stores, restaurants, and hotels create welcoming environments that enhance the customer experience. Back-office efficiency, storage organization, and easy-to-navigate layouts ensure smooth operations.

# Remote & Hybrid Work: The Best of Both Worlds

With the rise of remote and hybrid work, home offices, co-working spaces, and digital collaboration tools have become essential. Whether it's a quiet home setup or a shared workspace with high-speed internet, having the right environment can make all the difference in productivity and work-life balance.

Regardless of industry, the workspace is a silent force that influences efficiency, creativity, and overall success. Whether designing a high-tech office, an efficient warehouse, or a cozy café corner for brainstorming, investing in the right working space is an investment in better performance and satisfaction.

Ah, the **Husqvarna Svartpilen 401**—the bike that’s trying way too hard to be cool. Let’s break it down and give this overhyped hipster machine the roasting it deserves:

---

### 1. **The “Scrambler” That Can’t Scramble**  
   - Sure, it looks like it’s ready to tear up some dirt trails, but let’s be real—this thing is about as off-road capable as a pair of white sneakers. Those knobby tires? Just for show. Take it on gravel, and it’ll probably throw a tantrum.

---

### 2. **The Hipster Tax**  
   - You’re paying a premium for that minimalist Scandinavian design, which is basically just a fancy way of saying “we didn’t add any features.” Congrats, you bought a bike that looks like it belongs in an IKEA catalog.

---

### 3. **The “Baby Duke” Complex**  
   - Let’s not kid ourselves—the Svartpilen 401 is just a KTM 390 Duke in a fancy suit. Same engine, same performance, but with a price tag that says, “I care more about aesthetics than horsepower.”

---

### 4. **The Power of… Meh**  
   - A 373cc single-cylinder engine? Wow, so much power! Said no one ever. This thing struggles to keep up with traffic on the highway, let alone give you any real thrills. It’s like bringing a knife to a gunfight.

---

### 5. **The Vibrator on Wheels**  
   - That single-cylinder engine doesn’t just lack power—it also vibrates like a cheap massage chair. By the time you hit 60 mph, your hands will be numb, and your teeth will be rattling.

---

### 6. **The “Urban Adventurer” Who Never Adventures**  
   - Husqvarna markets this bike as the ultimate urban adventurer, but let’s be honest—you’re just riding it to the coffee shop to flex your “unique” taste in motorcycles. Adventure? More like a trip to Starbucks.

---

### 7. **The Pillion Seat That’s a Joke**  
   - Oh, you want to take a passenger? Good luck with that. The pillion seat is about as comfortable as a park bench, and your passenger will be holding on for dear life because there’s literally nothing to grab onto.

---

### 8. **The Fuel Tank That’s Thirsty for Attention**  
   - With a 9.5-liter fuel tank, you’ll be stopping at gas stations more often than you stop to take Instagram photos of your bike. Range anxiety? More like range reality.

---

### 9. **The Maintenance Nightmare**  
   - Sure, it’s a Husqvarna, but let’s not forget it’s basically a KTM in disguise. That means you’ll be visiting the service center more often than you’d like, and the bills will hurt almost as much as your ego when a scooter passes you.

---

### 10. **The “Cool Factor” That Wears Off**  
   - Yeah, it looks cool for about five minutes, but once the novelty wears off, you’re left with an overpriced, underpowered bike that’s trying way too hard to be something it’s not. It’s the motorcycle equivalent of a man bun.

---

### **Final Verdict:**  
The **Husqvarna Svartpilen 401** is the bike you buy when you care more about looking cool than actually riding. It’s all style, no substance—a hipster’s dream and a rider’s disappointment. But hey, at least you’ll look good while getting passed by a Ninja 400, right? 😏

I drink coffee daily, and over time, my teeth have picked up stains that regular toothpaste and whitening strips never seemed to fix.

I’ve seen a lot of **Laughland teeth whitening reviews** online and was curious if this kit actually worked. Unlike other at-home whitening products, Laughland uses **dentist-formulated whitening gel** and an **LED mouthpiece**, which supposedly enhances the process. The science behind it made sense, so I decided to test it out for six days.

Here’s how it went.

# What’s in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

When the kit arrived, I liked how minimal and easy-to-use everything seemed. Inside the box, you get:

✔ **Whitening Gel Pens** – No mess, just twist and apply.  
✔ **LED Mouthpiece** – Activates the gel for deeper, more even whitening.  
✔ **Step-by-Step Instructions** – No confusion, just simple steps.

The packaging felt high-quality, and I liked that the whole system was compact.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

One thing I appreciated was how **quick and easy** the process was. Each session takes just **10 minutes a day**. Here’s how it works:

1. **Brush & Dry Your Teeth** – This helps the gel stick better.
2. **Apply the Gel** – The pen makes it easy to target each tooth.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece** – Turn it on and wait for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse & Clean** – Rinse your mouth and clean the device after each use.

I usually did it while watching TV, so it never felt like a hassle.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No major difference, but my teeth felt clean.
* **Day 3:** The stains were starting to fade, and my teeth looked a little brighter.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter**, and the results were **even and natural**—not fake or overly bright.

The biggest surprise? **No sensitivity.** I was expecting at least some discomfort, but I didn’t feel anything, even after drinking cold water.

# What Makes Laughland Stand Out?

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel** – Designed to lift stains without weakening enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation** – Speeds up the whitening process and improves coverage.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients** – The gel stays potent, unlike some store-bought options that degrade over time.

**Want to see if it works for you? Learn more** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# How Laughland Compares to Other Whitening Products

* **Whitening Strips** – Left my teeth feeling sensitive, and results were uneven.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Good for maintenance, but didn’t do much for deep stains.
* **Professional Whitening** – Expensive and can leave teeth feeling sensitive for days.

Laughland was a **solid middle ground**—affordable, effective, and **no pain**.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Does it damage enamel?** – No, the formula is gentle but effective.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** – Yes, it helped with older coffee and tea stains.
3. **How long do results last?** – Avoiding staining foods helps maintain results for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

✔ **Be Consistent** – Use it daily for six days straight.  
✔ **Avoid Staining Foods** – Coffee, tea, and red wine can slow down results.  
✔ **Brush & Floss Daily** – Helps maintain a brighter smile.

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening** was exactly what I was looking for. It was simple to use, fit into my daily routine, and gave me **visible results** without causing any sensitivity.

If you’ve been looking for an at-home whitening option that actually works without breaking the bank, **this might be worth considering**.

The only think making me stand up is the fact i paid my uni taxes and if i don't attent lectures it's like i wasted money. Sentimentally i've been a wreck for months, socially i'm being outed and i'm starting to feel the awkardness around my friends, half the relatives i liked died in these years and academically i just learned i failed two exams i studied about 8 hours a day for a week or two. One of those i failed hard, so i'll have to wait about six months to retake it. 

Every time i tried to drag myself out of this pit i've just ended up deeper. I tried patching up my ex so there was gonna be less bile and anger and just ended up even worse, i tried studying harder and failed even more than before, i was gonna try to plug the hole that let out the rumor of me seeing a guy but now i think it'll just make the situation worse. I don't need anymore character development. 

Every week i felt worse, but relieved that it was going to be the worse i got, so it was all downhill from there, yet i just keep getting kicked while already on the ground. I don't feel anything anymore, joy fades away the minute i'm away from the source, i'd even want to feel sadness just to feel something, but it's like i'm not plugged in. I don't wanna kill myself, send me a reddit cares message and i'll send you seed oils in the mailbox. I've been smoking cigs like crazy, drinking way too much and spend half the day in bed. 

I'm losing it and not in the funny way. I used to think all day, write creative stuff, draw and doodle things, listen to music, chat with friends, see my boyfriend for coffee. All of that stopped this winter all together. My writing is shitty, my brain can't think, i feel dumber, sick all the time, tired for doing nothing and whenever i try to better myself i just end up worse.

Today, the drive-thru has become a modern cultural phenomenon used by banks, restaurants, coffee shops, convenient stores, car washes, and even zoos. We're able to get what we want, when we want it without taking much time or having a real interaction with real people. Even in Christianity, there are many teachings that treat God as if He was a drive-thru, a machine that exists to serve you. Just say the right words or formula and you'll get what you ask for. This is not the way to approach God, trying to get what you want from Him instead of having a relationship with Him. It's about seeing His face. Have you gotten more into your desires, requests, and petitions to God, then God Himself; coming to Him more to get your order filled than to relate to Him, driving past his presence instead of coming in? It's time to get out of your spiritual car, forget your demands and come into His presence. Because the Lord is a lot more than a burger and your relationship with Him is not a drive-thru.





From Message #513 - Fast Food Christianity  
Scripture: [Psalm 27:8](https://www.hopeoftheworld.org/Sapphires/index.php)

# Coworking spaces can be a game-changer—or a distraction—depending on how you work best. Here’s a real-world take on the ups and downs of ditching the home office for a shared space.

# Pros

# 1. Energy & Motivation Boost

There’s something about being surrounded by people who are also working hard that makes you want to step up your game. Seeing others build businesses, take calls, and make things happen can be contagious.

# 2. Escape From Home Distractions

If your home is filled with barking dogs, needy kids, or a never-ending pile of laundry staring at you, a coworking space removes all of that. It gives you a clear mental separation between ""home"" and ""work.""

# 3. Built-in Networking & Opportunities

You never know who you’ll meet—potential clients, collaborators, or even friends who just get what it’s like to work for yourself. These spaces can be goldmines for partnerships and business opportunities.

# 4. Structure Without Rigidity

You’re not bound by strict office rules, but the act of commuting to a space and working around others can give your day a more structured rhythm—without feeling like you’re trapped in a corporate setting.

# 5. Cool Perks & Better Coffee

Many coworking spaces offer free coffee, comfy lounges, event access, and sometimes even beer on tap. It beats brewing another sad cup of instant coffee at home.

# 6. More Professional Client Meetings

If you need to meet clients, a coworking space gives you access to conference rooms and a more professional setting—way better than a noisy café or your cluttered living room.

# Cons

# 1. Cost Adds Up

Compared to working from home (which is free), even a hot desk membership can eat into your budget. If you're just starting out, that $200-$500/month could be better spent elsewhere.

# 2. Potential for Noise & Distractions

Not all coworking spaces are the quiet productivity hubs they claim to be. You might get the person taking loud sales calls or a chatty group brainstorming loudly right next to you.

# 3. Commute Kills the Flexibility

One of the perks of remote work is no commute. If your coworking space isn’t close by, you might end up spending just as much time (and money) commuting as you would with a traditional office job.

# 4. Not Always ""Your Space""

Unless you pay for a dedicated desk, you might end up at a different spot every day. That means no leaving a second monitor, setting up your workspace exactly how you like it, or having a consistent ""home base.""

# 5. Social Pressure to Always Look Busy

Even if you're having a slow workday, sitting in a coworking space might make you feel like you have to keep typing just so you ""look productive"" to others around you. That can lead to unnecessary stress or even burnout.

# 6. Inconsistent Wi-Fi or Amenities

Some coworking spaces advertise fast internet and unlimited coffee—but the reality can be glitchy Wi-Fi and an empty coffee pot. If the amenities don’t hold up, it can be frustrating.

Coworking spaces are amazing for some and overrated for others. If you thrive on energy, networking, and a structured work environment, they can be worth every penny. But if you love working in your pajamas and don’t want to spend extra money, home might still be the best office for you.

Would you try a coworking space, or are you sticking with your current setup?",1,1740573376.0,u_healthyskinclub,0,1.0,False
1iymi90,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1iymi90/joe_k_part_9/,Joe K - Part 9,"""Nice to meet you,"" said Pearl Goolie. ""Please, take a seat. Sorry about the mess, I haven't had a chance to finish unpacking yet."" Broker had explained on the way over that the politician had just arrived in Glowbridge to contest the recently available parliamentary seat vacated by Hogarth Stone. There was much speculation about the reason for his untimely resignation, the press release merely eluding to personal health matters, but, whatever it was, the majority of the minority who actually care about local politics were an unsettled crew, suddenly cast adrift in the windy waters of woke without their captain at the helm. For nearly thirty years he had been defending real values, canvassing real votes and, perhaps most importantly, symbolising the impossibility of any real change in the minds of people who might consider voting against him. It was one of the safest seats in the country, which was why he'd continued to be tolerated by a leadership increasingly at odds with his antiquated personal views. The resignation they got was not as damaging as the defection he'd been plotting, but it was still a big problem for them. Stone had skilfully managed his career, securing the perpetual loyalty of his core support, but, given his rebellious reputation, it was often at the expense of their loyalty to the party. What was an extremely safe constituency, was now an extremely marginal constituency facing a snap by-election. Hence, Pearl Goolie. ""I've heard a lot about you, Joe, and I'd like to help you.""

""I'd appreciate that but, from what Bro tells me, you must be an extremely busy woman at the moment. I don't mean to be rude, but why would you take the time to help me?""

""Because you can help me,"" she bluntly replied.

""That seems unlikely, how?"" said K, wondering why he was being so defensive with this person, who, at least, was a lot more charming than the last politician he'd met. Goolie, however, seemed to understand his apprehension, and was considering how best to answer his question, when her personal assistant came in with the coffees. To make room on the desk for his, K had to pick up three framed photographs that had yet to find a permanent home in her new office.

""That's my partner, Kara, and our little girl, Lily. That's my paternal grandparents. They met on the boat, coming over from Trinidad. They faced poverty and racial discrimination their whole lives, but they never complained, just worked hard and raised six children - my father is the second eldest. That's him with my mother. *They* never stopped complaining, and campaigning, and marching, and fighting for the cause. I grew up with them dividing their time between the struggle to raise awareness and the struggle to raise us kids. Of course, in their day it was all about equality and community, now it's all about diversity and identity. And that's how you can help me, Joe. I'm widely perceived as a diversity candidate but, ironically, it's my perceived lack of diversity that could cost me votes in this town. Do you see what I mean?""

""Not exactly.""

""My reputation for championing the disenfranchised has served me well, but it's in danger of turning against me. If you google my name, and that's what people will do as soon as they see it on a campaign poster, you'll find comments such as 'she only cares about blacks and lesbians,' or words to that effect. I need to diversify and I need to do it quick, and that's where you come in, Joe. You have the identity to improve my diversity.""

""I didn't think I had much of an identity at all, until I was identified as a criminal.""

""Then we need to re-identify you as a victim.""

""Do I have to be one or the other?""

""If we want the media to pay attention, then yes. And the only way to influence the police is to put pressure on them through the media. Do you remember Omar Maraaba?""

""No, sorry.""

""Don't be, his story is typical enough, unfortunately, to have disappeared into the background noise by now. He was a nineteen-year-old Palestinian who came here on a scholarship a few years ago. An intelligent, dedicated student who also volunteered in a Mosque and worked in a takeaway, sending every spare penny he had back home to help his younger sister with her own education. But he made one mistake - he went on a protest march. The official story was that he died during a violent clash with the police initiated by a fringe element in the crowd. Many who were there disputed this, but it was their word against the authorities and no CCTV footage could be found to corroborate either interpretation, so no investigation was launched. Then, a few weeks later, a Conshop manager was going through some footage, looking for a local woman they suspected of shoplifting, when he spotted something. At first, he was angry with his assistant for failing to close the shutters, as he'd been instructed to do because of the protest, but then he saw a man being dragged into the alley and beaten by three police officers. Not sure how significant a find this was, and which official channel he could trust, the footage eventually ended up in the hands of an amateur film technician, who managed to clean it up enough to be able to identify Omar and two of the police officers. Convinced they had incriminating evidence, they handed it over to the police. Fortunately enough, they had enough sense to make a copy and, when it became obvious that no action was going to be taken, they posted it on the internet and sent the link to various television news stations and mainstream media outlets. It was this that forced their hand and the two serving police officers were immediately suspended and charged with causing grievous bodily harm. They both refused to cooperate with the investigation, of course, so the third officer was never identified and neither could be charged with manslaughter - both served less than a year. They were granted anonymity but one of them chose to waive it and now hosts a popular anti-immigration podcast.""

""What about the cover-up? wasn't that investigated?"" said K.

""We tried but... not in the media's interest equals not in the public interest.""

""So that was the end of it?""

""I saw his sister at the trial. Well, I only saw her eyes - the pretty face I'd seen in a photograph discovered amongst Omar's few possessions was now hidden from the public. 'We thought he'd be safe here,' she said. I asked her how her studies were going. 'Studies?' she said, as if such a concept was beyond comprehension. 'I was selfish then, I was ignorant. Now I know who our enemies are, I must help my brothers and sisters to fight them. It is God's will'. There *are* no ends, Joe, there are only consequences.""

""Shit,"" K didn't know what else to say, so Goolie changed the subject.

""Now, about you. There's a doctor we'd like you to see..."" She looked at Broker.

""Dr Sinha,"" he said.

""Yes, Dr Sinha. A solid medical diagnosis will certainly help draw attention to your case and speed things up a bit, at the very least. Our mutual friend, here, will give you the details. Now, as you pointed out, I'm an extremely busy woman at the moment, so I'll let my assistant show you both out and we'll speak again, soon.""

In the car, on the ride back to his flat, K was particularly quiet, even for him. Weirdly, it wasn't the thought of his case being used in an election campaign that particularly bothered him. He was sure that Pearl Goolie would make a much better MP than Hogarth Stone, and probably better than whoever she was going to be running against, and he was happy to help. There remained the distinct possibility of unwelcome media attention, but at least Goolie's plan, as far as he could tell from Broker's vague explanation, was a bit more low-key than a full blown national scandal. So what *was* bothering him?

""Relax,"" said Broker. ""Stone was... a mistake. Everything's going to work out with Pearl, she's one of the good ones.""

""I'm not worried about Pearl Goolie, I like her. I mean, she seems honest enough, for a politician. She talked to me like I was an equal, she looked at me like I was... an entity. I trust her. I guess we were lucky the old bastard resigned."" From Broker's physical reaction, which even K, with his limited ability to read body language, was able to pick up on, he had the distinct feeling of having just put his foot in it. ""Shit, I'm sorry, that was uncalled for, I forgot he was your friend - is he... seriously ill?""

""He's not my friend!"" It was the first time K had seen any hint of anger in Broker's congenial demeanour, and he realised that the journalist, himself, had been very quiet since they'd left Goolie's office, and even during the meeting itself. Am I your friend? thought K. What do friends do? In his head, he practised asking - ""Are you OK?"" or - ""Do you want to talk about it?"" but it just sounded forced and somehow like he was a character in a soap opera or a contestant on a reality TV program trying to make the audience believe they're a nice person who actually gives a shit about the rival celebrity-wannabe they've just met. On the other hand, the tension in the car was slowly becoming unbearable. He had to say something soon if he was going to salvage this new relationship.

""You know, I didn't know what to expect when you first suggested involving him and when I met him... wow, talk about a right-wing cliche. I'm not much for politics, but I was raised in a very left-wing environment, my dad...""

""Do you know what the real difference is between the left-wing and the right wing?"" said a still raging Broker, his eyes steadfastly fixed on the road ahead. ""The one thing everyone agrees on is that there's loads of bad, evil shit in the world, right? - that's one headline that isn't going to sell any newspapers. Left-wingers want all that evil shit to go away from the world and right-wingers want all that evil shit to go away from their neighbourhood - that's the only difference. And all the left-wing media want to do is sell newspapers to left-wingers and all the right-wing media want to do is sell newspapers to right-wingers. So they each tell their readers what they want to hear and keep reinforcing it. The right-wing media tell them that all the bad, evil shit is caused by immigration and gender identification and liberalisation, and the left-wing media tell them it's all caused by racism and sexism and capitalism. And they all tell everyone it's caused by the Russians and the Chinese because they don't have a *free press* like we do.""

""And they call *me* cynical... at least, they used to call me cynical, now..."" K stopped himself before he could aimlessly drift into self-deprecation. Although he was as bad at building friendships as he was at maintaining them, he suspected that self-deprecation was not the best way to go about it, and besides, there was no way someone like Broker would ever respect a man who shies away from an argument. K looked at his reflection in the wing mirror and gave himself a silent pep talk, before going for it. ""Anyway, that's not entirely true, is it? I mean, the press are also there to hold the government to account, even if they might disagree with each other about which party needs to be held to account.""

""The only time they'll genuinely hold anyone to account is when they do agree. Despite what some people think, there are a lot of amazing politicians out there - I know a few, and you've just met one, yourself. What amazes me most is how they manage to drag their arses out of bed every morning to work like hell, under extremely stressful conditions, just to fight for any small improvement for ordinary people, within a system that's almost always fighting against them, and without any chance of ever getting any real power because they don't kiss enough arses. You see, we don't live a meritocracy, we live in a sycophantocracy."" They were silent for the rest of the journey and, when he pulled up outside the north-east entrance to Malevich Square, Broker anxiously rummaged around in his glovebox and came out with Dr Sinha's card. ""Give her ring now, and make an appointment, we need to get moving on this... And I'm sorry about the rant, Joe, it's nothing personal, I guess I just got up on the wrong side of the world this morning.""

""No problem, Bro, and thanks, I do appreciate everything you're doing for me, I owe you one,"" K forced himself to say, desperate for a friendly reaction that didn't come. Whatever he had done to create this tension between them, he was determined to make amends.

Once inside the square, he caught sight of, then quickly pretended he hadn't, a zephyr smoking a rolled-up cigarette outside the doorway of East Block. Sensing a presence behind him, he walked across the front of North Block and up the path. In his shaking hand, the key took four attempts to find the lock, while he waited for his name to be called, or his shoulder to be tapped, or his head to be... He slowly walked towards the bottom of the stairwell until he heard the telltale click of the door closing behind him, then half-turned his head for visual confirmation that he was alone inside the building. Then he fully turned his head, to double-check the conclusions of his half-turned-head and satisfy himself that the humanoid movements it might have seen through the frosted glass were just his imagination playing tricks on him. Partially relieved, but still in a state of mental agitation, his mind full of nervous energy and confused thoughts, he failed to register Katie's polite, lukewarm greeting on the stairs until she'd passed him by. On realising what had happened, he felt the urge to apologise for accidentally ignoring her, but she was already on her way out of the block and it didn't feel right to go running after her, especially with a potential threat lurking in the shadows, so he ran up to his flat instead.

Through the window, he caught sight of her exiting the square onto Kandinsky Street, probably going to the Conshop for cigarettes. The zephyr was nowhere in sight, but the brief glance he'd got outside had left an after-image in his head of a toothless grin, convincing him that it had to have been the real deal, this time. He went to check his answering machine but there was no flashing light indicating a new message. Is that a good sign or a bad sign? he asked himself. Should I phone him now and pretend I hadn't seen him? pretend I've just got back home after being away for a few days? pretend I want to be friends? He picked up the phone... and slammed it back down. Maybe I should wait a few hours so it looks less like I'm doing what I'm doing... But this is exactly what I might be doing if I'd just gotten home and found his messages, right? He picked up the phone... and slammed it back down. ""Idiot!"" If he saw me just now, then he knows I didn't have a bag with me, so I couldn't have been away for a few days... And why should I pretend I want to be friends with him, anyway? what good would that do? And what if he doesn't even want to be friends any more? what if he's been reading that shit about me on the internet and he's decided I'm a satanic paedophile? what if I'm the new arch-nemesis in his fucking superhero fantasy?... ""Why did I have to make friends with a paranoid schizophrenic? - shit, what if I'm the paranoid schizophrenic?... Maybe I should see a doctor.""",1,1740573313.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

## Understanding Your Needs: Why This Comparison Matters

Before diving into the nitty-gritty, it's significant ⁣to ‍understand why ⁣the Powerbeats Pro vs AirPods Pro debate is so prevalent. ⁤Both⁣ earbuds are positioned as premium options, but cater to ⁣slightly different user bases.The ⁣AirPods Pro are frequently ​enough ⁤seen as the everyday, lifestyle choice,⁤ while the‍ Powerbeats Pro emphasize performance during exercise. This review⁣ aims to dissect​ these assumptions, ​providing a complete assessment that goes beyond brand perception.If you're seeking the best wireless earbuds for exercise,‌ or just a⁤ reliable pair for‌ your daily commute, understanding the⁣ difference between Powerbeats Pro and AirPods⁣ pro is ⁣crucial.

## Design and‍ Fit: Comfort is King (or Queen)

One of the most promptly noticeable differences ⁣between⁤ the ‌Powerbeats Pro⁤ and AirPods Pro lies ‍in their design.The Powerbeats ⁤Pro feature the iconic ear‌ hook design, providing a secure and stable fit, especially⁢ during ⁢intense workouts.This over-ear hook is a game-changer for ‍those who struggle with earbuds falling ⁤out during ⁤running or‍ other high-impact activities. Many view​ the secure fit‍ as​ a⁢ primary reason to buy Powerbeats Pro.

The AirPods Pro, on the ⁤other hand, ⁣offer a sleeker, stem-based design with​ customizable ​silicone ear tips. While they lack the ear hooks of the Powerbeats Pro,‍ the⁤ AirPods Pro’s multiple ear tip sizes help achieve a comfortable and relatively ‍secure fit for many users. The AirPods Pro are⁢ also generally‍ smaller and lighter than the Powerbeats Pro, making⁣ them more discreet and‍ comfortable for extended wear​ during less strenuous ⁢activities.For pure aesthetics, the airpods⁤ Pro boast a more minimalist profile, ⁣blending seamlessly into everyday life. However, the Powerbeats Pro’s sporty design makes a statement, signaling a focus on⁣ performance. Ultimately, deciding between the Powerbeats Pro ⁣vs AirPods Pro regarding ⁢fit comes‌ down ⁢to ⁣personal preference ⁤and ⁤intended use. If rock-solid stability‌ during exercise‍ is paramount, the Powerbeats Pro’s⁢ ear hooks are a clear advantage. If everyday comfort and a ‌less obtrusive design are higher priorities, the AirPods Pro might‍ be the ‌winner.

## Sound Quality: A Deep ‌Dive into Audio Performance

Sound quality​ is‌ naturally a major factor when comparing any set of earbuds. While both the Powerbeats⁣ Pro and AirPods pro⁤ deliver respectable‍ audio performance, they offer distinct sonic profiles.

The AirPods Pro generally ​provide a balanced and neutral sound signature, ideal for listeners who appreciate accurate audio‍ reproduction.​ Their Adaptive EQ feature automatically ​tunes the music to the shape of your ⁣ear, ⁢optimizing the listening experience. This ⁤results in clear vocals, well-defined instruments, and a‍ generally pleasant listening experience across ‍various genres. Many users find the AirPods Pro sound quality suitable for podcasts,audiobooks,and​ classical music.

In contrast, the Powerbeats Pro tend to emphasize bass frequencies, catering to listeners ‌who enjoy a‍ more energetic and dynamic ‍sound. This makes them well-suited for ​genres like pop, hip-hop, and​ electronic music, ⁤where the enhanced bass adds impact. The powerbeats⁤ Pro's​ sound profile can‌ be particularly motivating during workouts, providing an extra boost of energy. Though, some may find the boosted bass overpowering or muddy, ‍potentially masking finer ⁣details in⁣ certain tracks. To really compare the airpods pro vs powerbeats pro sound quality, think about what you⁣ listen to most.

ultimately, the‍ better sound ⁢quality depends on ⁣your individual‍ preferences. If you prioritize accuracy and a balanced sound, the AirPods Pro ​are ⁣a‍ strong choice. If you prefer a more bass-heavy and energetic‍ sound, the Powerbeats Pro may be more appealing.Consider also that‍ firmware and software updates constantly ​evolve the sound profiles of both devices.[[Explore Top Rated powerbeats pro vs airpods pro on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=powerbeats pro vs airpods pro)
## Noise ⁢Cancelling: Blocking Out the World

Active Noise⁣ Cancellation (ANC) is a critical feature ​for anyone who frequently uses ⁢earbuds in noisy environments. ⁤Both the⁣ AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro offer‌ ANC, but their performance differs slightly.

The⁣ AirPods Pro are widely regarded as having excellent noise cancelling capabilities. Their ANC effectively blocks out‍ a wide range of ambient sounds,​ from the ​drone of airplane engines to the chatter of ​a busy coffee shop. The Transparency mode allows you to hear your surroundings when needed,making them suitable for situations where situational ​awareness is important. Apple has consistently improved the ​ANC performance of ‍the AirPods Pro through firmware updates. When considering‌ noise cancelling earbuds​ comparison, the airpods Pro are consistently ranked highly.

The Powerbeats Pro⁤ offer noise isolation primarily ⁣through ‍their⁣ tight seal in the ear canal. While they don't have active noise cancellation in the same way as the AirPods Pro, the physical seal combined with the​ over-ear hooks provides a decent ‌level of ⁣passive noise reduction. The design inherently blocks out some external noise and allows you ⁣to be more present with your audio.‌ This‍ approach works⁤ especially well in the gym or during outdoor workouts where some ​awareness of your surroundings is⁤ still desired.

If active noise cancellation ‍is⁤ a top ‍priority, the AirPods Pro are the​ clear winner. Their ⁣elegant⁣ ANC technology provides superior noise reduction compared to the​ Powerbeats ⁢Pro's‌ passive noise isolation. However, ‌if you prefer ‍a balance‍ between⁢ noise ⁢isolation‌ and situational awareness, the Powerbeats Pro's design may be a better‍ fit.

## Battery Life: Staying Powered Through Your Day (and‌ Workouts)

Battery life is ⁤another crucial consideration, especially for users who rely⁢ on their wireless earbuds for extended ⁤periods.Both⁢ the Powerbeats Pro⁤ and AirPods ‌pro ⁤offer‌ competitive⁣ battery performance.

The Powerbeats Pro boast a longer battery life‍ on a single charge than the AirPods ⁣Pro.‌ You can ⁣expect up to 9 hours⁣ of listening ‌time on a single⁢ charge, with the charging case⁣ providing additional ⁢power for ⁤a total of over 24 hours. This extended ⁤battery life makes them ideal for long workouts, travel, or extended use throughout the day.

The​ AirPods⁢ Pro offer up to ‌6 hours of listening time with ANC⁣ enabled, and up to 7‌ hours ⁢with⁤ ANC disabled. The charging ​case provides⁣ additional charges, extending the total listening ⁣time to over 30⁣ hours. ⁤While the airpods Pro offer a longer total listening time with the charging case, the Powerbeats ⁤Pro win⁤ regarding single-charge battery life.

When ⁣comparing airpods pro vs powerbeats pro battery life, consider‍ your typical usage patterns.⁢ If you prioritize long listening⁤ sessions on a ⁤single charge, the Powerbeats Pro are the⁤ better choice.If you're comfortable charging your earbuds more ⁤frequently, the AirPods Pro's overall battery life with the​ charging case might be sufficient. ⁤Rapid‍ charging capabilities are present​ in both, ⁢offering about an hour of playback with just a ⁤5-minute charge.[[Explore Top Rated powerbeats pro vs airpods pro on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=powerbeats pro vs airpods pro)
##​ Sweat and‍ Water ⁤Resistance: Ready​ for Anything

For fitness ⁣enthusiasts, ‍sweat and water​ resistance are essential features. Both⁤ the Powerbeats ‌Pro and AirPods Pro are designed to withstand sweat and​ light rain, but their⁤ levels of ‍protection ⁢differ.

The Powerbeats⁤ Pro ⁤are rated ‍IPX4 for ‍sweat and ​water⁢ resistance, ⁣meaning ⁤they can withstand splashes of water and sweat.‍ this makes ‍them ⁣suitable for intense workouts and outdoor activities in light rain. The robust ​design further ​contributes to their durability.

the AirPods Pro are⁤ also rated IPX4 for sweat and water resistance. While they offer the same level of protection‌ as⁢ the Powerbeats Pro,some users may ​feel more‍ confident wearing‍ the Powerbeats Pro during strenuous‍ activities due to their more secure fit.

Considering both ​are rated​ IPX4, the actual difference in sweatproof and waterproof capabilities is negligible for most users. Both ⁣should survive sweaty gym ‍sessions⁤ and light ‌rain,⁣ but neither is designed for⁣ submersion⁢ in water. If you’re doing ‌intense water sports you may want to invest in a different set of earbuds.

As with any electronic‌ device, it's important to take‍ precautions to prevent damage from excessive ‌moisture.⁣ Regularly clean your earbuds and charging case, and avoid ⁢exposing⁤ them to extreme humidity or direct contact ⁤with water.

## Apple⁢ Ecosystem integration and ‌Android ⁣Compatibility

One of the primary considerations for Apple users is seamless integration⁣ with the Apple‍ ecosystem. Both‍ the powerbeats Pro and airpods Pro offer excellent integration with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple devices. Pairing is​ simple and automatic, thanks to​ the H1 chip or H2 chip.These processors provide fast ​and stable Bluetooth connections, ⁢low latency, ⁣and ‌seamless switching between devices.

However, ⁢it's important to​ note​ that ⁢both earbuds ​also offer ⁢compatibility with ⁣Android ‍devices, albeit with​ some limitations. ‍Pairing with​ Android devices​ is straightforward⁢ via Bluetooth, but some features, like ⁤automatic device switching and spatial audio, are exclusive to ⁢Apple devices. The Beats app for Android provides some customization options for the Powerbeats Pro,‌ while the AirPods Pro offer‌ limited customization on Android.

When ‍comparing airpods pro vs powerbeats pro apple ⁣ecosystem integration, both ⁤excel. However, for Android users, the ⁤Powerbeats Pro may offer a slightly better experience due to the Beats app.‌ It's​ a more important factor to consider if you are an android user.
In terms of firmware updates,‍ the⁢ Powerbeats ​Pro maintain an advantage, allowing firmware updates via the beats app on both iOS and Android.⁤ This contrasts with the AirPods Pro, which can onyl receive firmware ‍updates ⁢with an ⁣iOS device.

## Microphone Quality: Crystal Clear‌ Calls

The quality of the microphone is⁤ crucial for‍ taking calls and using​ voice assistants. both the Powerbeats Pro ‍and AirPods Pro feature built-in microphones, but‌ their performance​ varies.

The AirPods Pro are renowned for their excellent microphone quality. They ‌employ advanced algorithms to‍ reduce⁢ background noise and enhance voice clarity, resulting in⁤ clear and natural-sounding ⁤calls. The wind noise reduction feature is particularly effective, ‍making them suitable‍ for ⁤calls in windy environments.

The Powerbeats⁢ Pro also offer ​decent microphone quality,but they may not be as effective as the AirPods Pro in noisy environments.While the Powerbeats Pro microphones perform acceptably indoors,⁣ outside tests in windy environments ⁢have yielded less favorable results.

If microphone quality‍ is a ⁣top priority, especially for frequent ​calls in various environments, the AirPods ​Pro are the better choice. Their advanced noise‌ reduction⁢ and clear⁤ voice transmission provide⁣ a superior calling experience.

##‌ Price and Value: Getting the most ⁣for your Money

Price ‌is always a significant‌ factor when ⁢making a purchase decision. Both‍ the Powerbeats Pro and AirPods ​pro are premium wireless earbuds, ⁢and their prices reflect ‍this. It's⁣ critically important to consider‍ the ​features and performance offered by ‍each to determine which provides better value for your money.

Generally, the AirPods Pro and⁣ Powerbeats Pro are⁣ priced similarly. Discounts and‍ deals can frequently enough be found, particularly during sales events. It's worth checking different retailers and online marketplaces to⁣ find the‌ best prices. Keep in mind that pricing may vary depending on promotions and product generations. ⁤Checking for the best deals for airpods pro ⁤or powerbeats pro depends on the model and retailer.

1iymfae,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_healthyskinclub/comments/1iymfae/transforming_workspaces_how_different_industries/,Transforming Workspaces: How Different Industries Maximize Efficiency,"Take a moment and picture your ideal workspace. Is it a sleek corporate office with floor-to-ceiling windows? A buzzing café with the aroma of fresh coffee? A spacious warehouse filled with tools and machinery? Whatever you imagined, one thing is certain: the right working environment is crucial to success, no matter the industry. Let's explore how different workspaces shape productivity, creativity, and efficiency across various fields.

# Corporate & Tech: Where Collaboration Meets Innovation

For tech companies and corporate businesses, the workspace is more than just desks and computers—it’s a hub of collaboration. Open offices, co-working spaces, and conference rooms encourage teamwork and quick idea exchange. Many tech giants incorporate nap pods, game rooms, and flexible seating to keep employees refreshed and creative.

# Healthcare: Functionality Meets Comfort

Hospitals, clinics, and medical offices need to balance efficiency with comfort. Well-designed workspaces in healthcare ensure doctors and nurses have quick access to supplies, patient records, and consultation areas. At the same time, warm lighting, comfortable waiting areas, and private consultation rooms help ease patient anxiety.

# Manufacturing & Industrial: Safety and Workflow Efficiency

Factories and warehouses require a workspace that prioritizes safety and streamlined workflow. Open floor plans, designated zones for different tasks, and proper ventilation ensure both productivity and worker well-being. Ergonomic workstations also play a key role in reducing injuries and increasing efficiency.

# Creative Industries: Inspiring Innovation

Artists, designers, and writers thrive in spaces that fuel imagination. Many creative professionals prefer open studios, shared workspaces, or cozy home offices filled with natural light, colorful decor, and inspiring artwork. The flexibility to personalize their work environment enhances motivation and artistic output.

# Education: Spaces that Foster Learning

From classrooms to research labs, educators and students need spaces that encourage focus and engagement. Modern schools incorporate flexible seating, interactive whiteboards, and breakout zones for group work, making learning more dynamic and enjoyable.

# Retail & Hospitality: Customer Experience is Key

For retail and hospitality businesses, the workspace isn't just for employees—it directly impacts customers. Thoughtfully designed stores, restaurants, and hotels create welcoming environments that enhance the customer experience. Back-office efficiency, storage organization, and easy-to-navigate layouts ensure smooth operations.

# Remote & Hybrid Work: The Best of Both Worlds

With the rise of remote and hybrid work, home offices, co-working spaces, and digital collaboration tools have become essential. Whether it's a quiet home setup or a shared workspace with high-speed internet, having the right environment can make all the difference in productivity and work-life balance.

Regardless of industry, the workspace is a silent force that influences efficiency, creativity, and overall success. Whether designing a high-tech office, an efficient warehouse, or a cozy café corner for brainstorming, investing in the right working space is an investment in better performance and satisfaction.

He had messaged her to meet at this address, but he was fifteen minutes late. Cars passed by with confused drivers staring at the curvy blonde in her tight-fitting red dress. She was quite a contrast to the rusted junkyard behind her. Getting increasingly annoyed she sent a message to Jeremy, WHERE ARE YOU! Right as the message went through, she could see him pedaling up the street on his bike. He was wearing tattered jeans and a t-shirt with his long brown hair tied back into a bun.

 

Molly looked at him with an icy glare, “Your Late.”

“Relax, I had to double check I packed everything.” Jeremy said, holding up his camera bag. “Well, I’m not paying you to be late” Jeremy turned away rolling his eyes as he locked his bike up against the junkyard's chain link fence. Molly had offered half his usual day rate. Jeremy had only agreed to take the job as a favor to Molly’s roommate so she could get some peace for the day.

“What are we doing at the gross junkyard anyway? This place smell”

“Weren’t you the one saying you needed some more interesting locations for your photoshoots. Trust me this place will be perfect.”

Jeremy led Molly around the junkyard fence till he spotted a no trespassing sign hung up. He grabbed a loose corner of the fence holding it back for Molly to walk through. Molly scoffed as she crouched down shuffling her way through the fence. Jeremy quickly ducked under letting the fence snap back into place on his way through. 

 

They walked through the dusty lot scouting for a good area for some photos. The junkyard felt endless as they passed by countless piles of scrap metal, tires, and rusted old appliances. “Why do we have to go so far in? All of these piles of garbage look the same.” Jeremy didn’t pay attention to Molly’s complaining. He was too focused on finding just the right spot for their photo shoot. Winding past a few more piles of junk Jeremy’s eyes lit up. He had found the spot he was looking for. In front of a mountainous pile of broken-down cars was the rusted-out shell of a 1972 mustang.

 

Molly checked her makeup in the side mirrors of the broken-down car while Jeremy set his bag down assembling his camera equipment. Molly leaned on the car cycling through her usual sultry poses as Jeremy snapped photos. As Molly kept posing Jeremy zoned out staring off into the distance. “Hey why did you stop” Jeremy let out a big sigh, “These are the same three poses that you do for all of your photos. I thought you wanted to give your followers something new.”

“I do! Hello this is a totally different from the university campus.”

Jeremy opened his mouth to argue but ended up rubbing his face in vexation instead. “Just wait here I think I have an idea.”

 

Jeremy walked off disappearing behind the piles of cars. Molly leaned against the broken-down mustang tapping her bright red nails against the car as she waited for him to come back. She could hear clangs and metal scrapping as he dug around the scrap piles. After all the waiting she expected Jeremy to return with some impressive idea instead he was holding a metal pipe. He tossed the pipe out to her, but she moved out of the way letting it clatter to the ground. Molly looked back at him as if he had gone crazy. “Try hitting the car with it.” Skeptically Molly picked up the pipe pointing it back at Jeremy, “Fine, we will try this your way, but if I don’t get any usable shots, I’m using this on you next.”  Jeremy just chuckled back “fair enough.”

 

Standing to the side of the car Molly swung the pipe bouncing it off the driver side door. “You know it’s already in a junkyard. I don't think you need to hold back.” Set off by the comment she brought the pipe all the way behind her head bringing it down on the side mirror. The mirror broke off dangling by a wire from the car as Molly looked surprised by her own strength. She held the pipe flexing, amused at her achievement. “You know this is actually pretty fun.” Kicking off her high heels she climbed up onto the car standing on the roof. In a frenzy she swung the pipe down at the car smashing at the windows and hood.  Jeremy circled around the car taking shots from every angle. By the end Molly was out of breath panting but had a triumphant glow about her. She hopped off the back of the car tossing the pipe down to the ground. 

 

Molly slipped her shoes back on catching her breath, “That was actually a pretty good workout.”

Jeremy held the camera up cycling through the photos he had taken. “We ended up with some really great shots. Your fans aren’t going to be disappointed.”  A giant shadow started to form  on the pair from the enormous piles of junk. Jeremy looked up disappointedly at the sky. They were losing good lighting and wouldn’t be able to shoot much longer. “We need to get one more photo before we go. I found a car crusher on the other side of this junk pile. Let's get a shot of you posing in front of it.”

 

Jeremy grabbed his bag, leading Molly around the mountain of junk to the car crusher. To Molly’s surprise this side of the lot looked a lot more orderly than the rest. There were dozens of cars that had been flattened and compacted neatly into stacked rows running alongside the car crusher. Molly stood front and center posing with the machine in the background. She held her pose waiting for Jeremy to snap the photo, but he had set his bag down digging around for something. “Didn’t you just say we needed to do this quick”. Jeremy barely glanced up, “Yeah, I’m just looking for my other lens. It must have fallen out of my bag.” Carefully setting his camera down Jeremy ran back to the smashed car to look for his missing camera lens.

 

Molly sat back leaning on one of the rows of compacted cars. She was thinking ahead about how she would debut her new set of photos. As she leaned back on the car, she felt her hand slipped off the edge of the crumpled car sliding inside. She could feel a wave of terror wash over herself as a small set of hands grabbed onto her arm. A sharp pain shot through her arm as teeth pierced into her arm. She screamed, yanking her arm back out of the crumpled car. Clutching her arm, she backed away keeping her eyes on the car. Jeremy came sprinting from around the corner, “What's going on?” Molly held out her arm, still clutching it with her hand. “Something just bit me!”

“What was it?”

Wincing Molly slowly took her hand away revealing the bite mark on her arm. The teeth had left an imprint on her skin the size and shape of a small child's mouth. The imprint looked jagged and missing more than a few teeth. A few spots of blood started to appear on Molly’s arm where the skin had been punctured.

Cautiously Jeremy walked over to the car, turning on the flashlight on his phone. Shining the light down into the car, he tried to get a look at what had bitten Molly. He couldn’t see any signs of an animal. Jeremy shrugged, “Whatever it was must have run off.”

“Did you find your stupid lens I’m getting out of here.”

Jeremy held up his camera accidentally taking a photo “Don’t you want to get the last shot”

“Not after something just tried to kill me.”

Jeremy didn’t want to press his luck and walked Molly back to the hole in the fence where they snuck in. “Give me a few days and I’ll get the photos over to you.”

 

Molly made it back to her dorm, opening the door into a pile of her roommates’ boxes. The room was overflowing with clutter. On one side were various piles of Molly’s clothes, and on the other was her roommate Jessica's electrical engineering supplies. Molly kicked the box of spare electronics parts blocking the doorway. “How many times do I have to tell you? Keep your stuff on your side Jessica!” Molly had never gotten along well with her roommate and getting bit in the junkyard did make things any better. “That is on my side, besides aren’t you supposed to be at a photoshoot?”

Molly held out her arm to Jessica showing off the bite mark “We had to cut it short.” The bite mark on Molly’s arm had stopped bleeding, but the skin around the bite was starting to turn a sickly green.

“You should really go see a doctor about that.”

“I’m sure I can just sleep it off and it will be fine tomorrow”

Jessica shook her head and went back to studying.

 

The next morning Jessica had already left for class by the time Molly got up. She had slept in late but woke up feeling like she had the worst hangover of her life. Her head felt like it was splitting in half and her entire body was aching. Getting out of bed she pulled the blinds closed. The light coming through the window was so bright she could barely see. Crawling out of bed she looked down at her arm and her heart raced. The bite looked even worse today. Almost her entire forearm had turned a dark green overnight. She talked to herself trying to calm down, “Ok, Ok I just need to go to the clinic. I’m sure I just need an antibiotic or something and clear this right up.”

 

The thought of walking across campus to the clinic made her feel exhausted. She decided if she could just get her usual latte maybe that would give her enough of a boost to make it there. Looking down at her arm in disgust there was no way she was going out in public like this. Grabbing for her makeup she caked it on her arm concealing all of the green on her forearm. She was too tired to do much else, opting to tie her hair up into a bun and throw on her roommates’ sunglasses. She stumbled out the door feeling like she had been hit by a truck. Taking the stairs slowly she shambled down and across the street to the nearest coffee shop.

 

It was early afternoon by the time she made it into the coffee shop. With her head still throbbing she was glad to have missed the morning rush. She ordered her usual latte and waited by the counter. The barista handed her drink across the counter pointing to her arm, “What were you painting?” Molly looked at her arm in shock. The green bite was rapidly spreading over more of her skin. Molly grabbed the drink covering her arm and hurried out of the coffee shop. Standing on the sidewalk she took a sip of her latte. Looking down there was a small white and red lump sitting in the milk. As she nudged the lump with her finger her heart froze. There was a human tooth in her drink. The aftertaste of copper filled her mouth. Running her tongue along her teeth confirmed her fear. One of her own teeth had fallen out into her drink.

 

She dropped the latter to the ground racing back to her dorm room. Bursting into her room she tore off the sunglasses, looking in the mirror. Staring back at her was a set of yellow jaundiced eyes. Her entire body started to shake as she took in her appearance. The green skin was rapidly spreading from her arm across her chest and covering her body. She could feel three more teeth fall out in her mouth spitting them out into the sink with a mouth full of blood. She reached up to adjust the bun in her hair that had shifted to the side. As she went to adjust the mass of hair it sloughed off into her hand. Over half her hair had fallen out in the bun leaving patches of wispy blonde. Molly let out a shrill scream dropping the hair to the ground.

Jeremy was sitting in front of his computer pouring through the hundreds of photos he had taken yesterday. He was looking for just the right photos to touch up and send back to Molly. As he quickly scrolled through the photos, he caught a glimpse of something unfamiliar in the background. Zooming in on the scrap piles he saw a small set of beady eyes looking back at the camera. Jeremy couldn’t make out what it was but was disconcerting that they might have been watched. He scoured through the photos focusing on the background hoping to catch another picture of what was spying on them. Investigating the photos more closely almost all of them had some trace of the set of eyes in them. He got a shiver down his back realizing he had been being watched the entire time and not realized it. Scrolling through a dozen more photos he found what he was searching for. In the background of the photos was a green creature that could best be described as a goblin. Caught in the act, it was lurching out of the scrap heap towards his bag. The small green creature had wrinkly green skin with beady yellow eyes and hardly any hair.

 

He had been too caught up taking photos of Molly at the time to realize, but the photos didn’t lie. The goblin had been bold enough to sneak his camera lens out his backpack when he was distracted. Part of him wanted to race back to the junkyard to get a few more photos of the goblin. After all no one was going to believe this, but when he scrolled down to the final photo in the set he froze. It was the picture he accidentally took of Molly right after the bite. In the background of the photo were more than a dozen sets of angry glowing eyes scowling at the camera. Putting the memory card back into his camera, he hurried over to Molly’s apartment on his bike. He had to tell her what he had found and what had bitten her. 

 

On his way into the Mollys building Jeremy practically had to dive out of the way to avoid a kid wearing a gray hoodie charging out. The kid was carrying two massive boxes filled to the brim with electronics and metal scraps. Jeremy wondered if they could see where they were going or even old enough to go to school here. As quickly as the kid had run by, the thought flew out of his head. He had to find Molly and show her the unbelievable photos. When he got up to Molly’s apartment the door was flung wide open. The apartment looked like it had been ransacked. Stepping in the room Jeremy noticed chunks of Molly’s blonde hair littered across the carpet. Boxes of circuit boards had spilled and knocked over along Jessica’s side of the room. Stepping further into the room a splash of color in the sink caught his eye. He glanced over to see the blood coated sink with a handful of teeth scattered in the basin. Instantly he felt sick to his stomach. It dawned on him that the kid leaving the building must have attacked and robbed Molly.

 

Running outside he jumped on his bike. He knew the chances were slim, but he had to try to catch the thief. Pedaling his bike like a mad man he zoomed off the direction of the thief. A few blocks later, to his own surprise he saw the outline of the kid in the gray hoodie dashing away with the boxes. Jeremy shouted for the kid to stop, but the kid picked up the pace running even faster. The kid didn’t bother to look back as screws and small parts scattered out of the boxes he had stolen. Jeremy swerved his bike trying to dodge them. As he continued the chase Jeremy realized where the kid was fleeing to. They were headed to the junkyard where he had met Molly. He figured the kid was looking to make a quick buck.

 

Jeremy veered down an alley to intercept the kid right in front of the junkyard. Just as he expected he could see the kid running up the street towards him. He couldn’t get a good look at his face between the boxes and hoodie. Jeremy got off his bike hiding at the edge of the alley. He could hear the rattling of electronics as the thief approached. He dove out from the alley grabbing the thief by the arm. The boxes of electronics slammed to the grounds spilling across the sidewalk.

 

Holding onto the thief's arm they wrestled back and forth as the thief tried to get away. As they grappled back and forth Jeremy noticed the thief's sickly green hands with red nail polish. Jeremy grabbed the thief’s hood, pulling it back and froze. Half of her face had turned wrinkled and green, but it was Molly. She had shrunk down to almost half her natural height glaring back at him with sickly yellow eyes.  Only a few patches of wispy blonde hair remained on her head. “Molly?” Jeremy called out confused. But it wasn’t completely Molly anymore. She let out a sharp hiss exposing her missing teeth and punching him in the gut. Jeremy dropped to his knee watching her dart off through the junkyard fence. He got to his feet chasing after her only to slip on the scattered electronics.

 

By the time he got to the junkyard's chain link fence she had disappeared behind the mountains of scap. Pulling back the corner of the fence he went in after her. He got his camera out of his bag ready to snap a photo at any instant. He wanted to try to get Molly out of there. If he couldn’t he knew no one would believe this crazy story without some kind of proof. Walking through the lot he stared at the ground following the tiny footprints hastily made in the dirt. Hesitantly he called out for Molly unsure if it would coax her out or scare her off.

 

The trail of footprints came to an end and Jeremy looked up in surprise to see he had wound up back at the car crusher. Glancing around he saw no signs or trace of Molly. He walked around to the crushed cars cautiously peeking inside thinking Molly might be hiding. A low growl emanated from one of the cars as he leaned over. He jumped back as the crumpled door swung open towards him, almost hitting him in the leg.  A goblin started to crawl its way out. “Molly?”

 

Jeremy quickly realized it wasn’t the goblin he was looking for. The goblin was wearing pieced together armor made from scrap metal. Any exposed skin he could see was covered in scars. The goblin snarled at him as it pulled a stop sign turned weapon out of the crumpled car. Jeremy wasn’t sure how much of a threat the small goblin would be, but he knew he didn’t want to find out. Slowly backing away he heard a clatter of metal scraps behind him. He quickly glanced back to see two more goblins appearing behind him. They both looked just as sinister as the first with junkyard armor and metal shivs in their hands.

 

The goblin with the stop sign lunged forward swinging the sign like an axe. Jeremy brough his camera up in a panic to block the blow. The camera protected him, but the clash sent it hurtling to the ground shattering into pieces. He didn’t have time to mourn his camera, all he could think about now was escaping. Turning to run, he straightened out his arm pushing one of the goblins down to the ground. He felt a sharp sting in his leg as he passed by the other goblin. Jeremy knew he must have been stabbed but he didn't look back. He ran as fast as he could to get away from the trio. Once he made it out of the junkyard, he would worry about patching himself up.

 

Running away from the goblins he rounded the corner only to see the path blocked by a mound of metal scraps. He turned around running down the next path he saw. He wasn’t sure where it led but anything was better than staying with the three goblins. Metal cans started to rain down on him as he ran between the piles of scrap metal. He looked up to see goblins standing on top of the piles shaking metal pipes and hurling anything they could get their hands on down at him. Jeremy grabbed a metal trash can lid out of a nearby pile holding it over his head as a shield. It offered some protection as cans clanked off the lid, but it didn’t deter the goblins. More objects continued to rain down as he ran through the junkyard. 

 

Jeremy kept moving forward looking for an exit. His legs started to buckle as he jogged along. Looking back at his leg he saw a metal shiv poking out of the side of his thigh. A thick yellow liquid was running off the handle. His heart started to race even faster, worried that he was poisoned and might face the same fate as Molly. There wasn’t any way he could save her now. All he could focus on was trying to get out in one piece himself.

 

More objects rained down from behind forcing Jeremy to turn around and guard himself with the lib. Backing up he didn’t see the drop behind him. His foot stepped back into the air with nothing under it sending him tumbling to the ground. The rain of objects had stopped as he stood back up to find himself in a shallow dirt pit surrounded by junk. Dozens of goblins appeared lining the side of their dirt arena. They banged metal weapons together and cheered as goblin Molly descended into the arena wearing her gray hoodie.

A goblin wearing a crown made of scraps tossed down a hammer landing at Molly’s feet. She picked up the hammer clutching it in her green hands. “Chaah” she let out with a hiss charging at Jeremy. He held the trash can lid like a shield ramming her back toward the dirt wall of the arena. Her small body was sent flying, but she was back on her feet in an instant. Jeremy pulled the shiv out of his leg getting ready to defend himself. His body was heavy with each move that he made. As Molly charged at him again, he raised his trash can shield to block Molly’s next swing. Instead of hitting the lid like he expected, pain exploded from his foot as Molly’s strike slammed down.

 

Jeremy cried out collapsing to the ground dropping the metal shiv to the side. With a trembling arm he weakly brought up his hand trying to hold Molly back as she closed in. For a brief moment Jeremy’s arm held her back until she bit down on his arm with her remaining teeth. His arm fell to the side as she strolled up beside his head. Whatever the goblins had poisoned him with was in full effect. Jeremy could barely move a muscle as she approached. He could hear the goblins cheering and laughing as she raised the hammer up into the air. The dark silhouette of the hammer came smashing down, crushing Jeremy’s skull. He had died after the first swing, but that didn’t stop Molly’s fury as the other goblins cheered her on.",5,1740572932.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

Originally, I got beige because it’s a very small space so thought it would brighten it up and I could use black accents such as a floor lamp, books, tray etc. I also thought since the kitchen is dark that the kitchen is an accent in itself.

This is a lengthy post, so bear with me. It doesn't encompass everything about me, but is a close approximation.

Age: 28 female

Height: 5 2""

Caste: Kashmiri Butt

Sunni, practicing Muslims

Single, never married or engaged

City: Lahore

Whether you live here or abroad, I'm looking for someone who's originally from Lahore to make the family meetups smoother and having a cultural similarity as well.

**Education**: BS (Honors) in Applied Psychology and Master's in Clinical Psychology.

\-> Currently preparing to apply for a PhD

**Profession**: Clinical Psychologist/ Mental Health Counsellor

Family: We're 3 siblings including me. One brother, one sister. Mother is a housewife. Father is retired from work.

Do you want kids? - Yes of course. But I’d like to wait at least a year and half (minimum) or so to settle into the marriage first, get to bond with my spouse, get acquainted with each other's patterns better and then step into the role of a parent, which is an enormous responsibility as is.

**Religiosity**

I’d say that I'm a relatively practicing Muslim. Although I’m clearly not perfect, I do pray at least 4 times, do obligatory fasts, do hijab, dress modestly, like to learn from various scholars like Mufti Menk, Dr. Omar Sulieman, Ustad Nouman Ali Khan, Dr. Yasir Qadhi, etc. to become a better Muslim and a better human being. Mind you, I’m modest but not an extremist/conservative by any means and highly value open-mindedness in myself and others.

I’m a Sunni Muslim. We don’t celebrate Milaad, khatam or do any other nazro niaz. I want someone who’s on the same page.

**Deal Breakers:**

·        Poor personal hygiene

·        Being younger than me

·        Drinking, smoking or any kind of substance use in the past or present.

·        Good old commitment issues! :(

·        Me having to live with in-laws after marriage

·        Poor emotion regulation, i.e. anger management issues, poor communication (think: stonewalling), paranoid or suspicious tendencies.

·        Disrespecting women and not seeing them as equally smart human beings. Treating them like house-maids or mere babymakers.

·        Not concerned with whether you earn halal or haram/ via fair or unfair means.

·        Arrogance, lying, closed-mindedness

·        Bringing trauma-responses, dysfunctional coping mechanisms/ baggage from previous relationships.

 

**Ideal marriage timeline** – Around 1 ish year, but this can be mutually decided.

**Important Characteristics in a Prospect**

**Education**: Anywhere from BS Honors to PhD, MBBS, etc.; the higher the better. Intellectual compatibility is absolutely paramount for me, such that we teach and learn from each other. I am a sapiophile.

**Age**: somebody older than me

**Good personal hygiene and discipline** – It should go without saying, but I want someone who takes good care of his personal hygiene, is organized and disciplined in life.

**Self-sufficient** – I fully acknowledge that women are nurturers and carers; they make a house a home. Having said that, I’d highly value a spouse who is not shy to help around in the house chores and is able to manage himself when the need be. Showing consideration for your spouse and being able to take care of yourself are such valuable traits (for any adult, not just men). Yes, women are inherently carers, but everything in moderation, including moderation!

**Balance of Deen and Duniya** – I know, cliche! Right? Let me explain.

This means praying regularly, being God-fearing in his conduct and trying to learn more about religion and aspiring to become a better human being. Bottom line, the basic pillars of religion should be there. I’m not looking for perfection, (I’m far from it myself tbh), but having high moral values guiding your strong moral compass is golden. Mind you, I don't want the typical molvi kind, rather someone educated on true Islamic ideology; nothing extreme or regressive pls.

I’d also want my partner to have good Ikhlaaq; so he’s kind and gentle, easy to talk to and has good relationships with people around him. Humility is the greatest virtue; I believe that true Deen is always reflected in one’s good character, not the obligatory prayers or fasts.

**Having Perspective and being far-sighted** \- Someone who values character, commitment, closeness, meaningful connection, loyalty and personality compatibility beyond just typical appearance ideals. Indeed, physical attraction is important for marriage, but is only one part of the equation; true connection goes so much deeper. After all, what are you left with once the novelty runs out? The ""person"" you married :)

**Sense of Emotional Safety** –  I wish to feel emotionally safe with my spouse. Someone who respects mine and others’ opinions, is open-minded, trustworthy, gives space and grace, respects boundaries, is supportive, patient and tolerates a difference of opinion. A dynamic where we both feel heard and seen and can express ourselves without fear of judgement; where we both can be our authentic selves :)

**Good communication** – There are few things I value more than good communication skills. I would like my spouse to be able to articulate and openly express his thoughts, opinions and feelings and be willing to have difficult conversations with me \*say no to stonewalling.\*

**Freedom** – Freedom is my strongest core value. I want to feel free and autonomous around my spouse, i.e. to feel a sense of psychological safety around him and not feel caged. I’d really appreciate the freedom to choose to work or to stay at home.

**Nuclear family** \- I'm a strong proponent of a nuclear family, i.e. husband, wife and their kids, which is conducive to (well-deserved) privacy and mental health of all parties involved. I was raised in one, so I can attest to its benefits. Unfortunately, joint family system fosters many domestic disputes and inevitable conflicts. So, I’d really appreciate it if you can comprehend this (without being offended) and can provide a nuclear family setup. Rented house is okay, so long as it's separate.

**Emotional availability** – That is, he is able to empathize, comfort, reciprocate love and care and express his own feelings, not afraid to lend a shoulder to cry on or appreciate others. A man who can emotionally validate and support his wife.

**Financial stability** \- Not being materialistic or unrealistic here, but a man should be able to provide and be ambitious enough to have goals for future growth to sustain his family in the long run.

**Generosity** \- Someone who is generous (while staying within reason and your means, of course) and not stingy with spending.

A simple wedding - I'd prefer a relatively simple wedding.

**NOTE**: I know this may look like much, and nobody is perfect. But please note that this is a broad sketch of an ideal person for me; anyone who’s somewhere along these lines would be wonderful. Wese bhi, humans are quite heterogeneous :)

**Hobbies** \- Wese to I’m pretty boring by regular standards, but here we go ;)

I love to watch English movies, series, anime (AOT anyone? Studio Ghibli? IYKYK), love to listen to audiobooks (I don’t prefer to read them, unless required professionally). But I do read a lot of other things. These days, I’m listening to “The Happiness Trap"" by Dr. Russ Harris.

I watch documentaries and video essays on social, cultural issues, psychology, psychiatry, healthy lifestyle, true crime, etc. I’m into learning about nutrition and physical health and try to incorporate the learnings in my life as much as is practical for me. I enjoy instrumental compositions, especially piano. I’m mesmerized by space and the vastness and mystery of the universe. I'm an avid listener of podcasts on plethora of topics from religion to medicine, mental health, relationship psychology, self-help and neuroscience, etc. I think YouTube is the greatest learning and leisure resource. I really love Modern Wisdom by Chris Williamson, Diary of A CEO by Steven Bartlett, The Huberman Lab and Mel Robbin’s Podcast, among many others.

**Interesting things about me:**

I’m an ambivert and keep a very small circle. I love my “me time"" and socialize selectively. I’m detail-oriented and prefer routine and order in life. I’m a Type-A person and an ISTJ (if that matters to you and you understand it). Not materialistic and generally low maintenance and simple. I’m a bronze medalist and also a published researcher in Clinical Psychology discipline. I highly value my privacy, in real life but especially online.

With the select few ppl, I'm such a talker and conversationalist. My idea of a good time is having deep conversations and sharing ideas over a cup of chai/coffee. I love to teach and explore concepts with others. Things like watching and discussing movie plots, fan theories, documentaries, existential questions, ideologies, psychology, philosophy, space/universe, academia and books you read are all right up my alley. The gist is: I’m a fan of cognitive labor. If you get me started on topics of my interest, I'll go into deep rabbit holes with so many tangents, you'll probably have to stop me at some point. Hehe :) Some say I'm a decent listener too so... (hey, I’m a therapist afterall...)

I grew up in the Middle East. I prefer simplicity and prioritize self-care (both physical and mental). I’m family-oriented and have a vision for my future parenting practices. My graduate research was on parenting. Still, I believe one can never prepare enough for a job as daunting as ""good parenting.""

I'm working on becoming a better cook too. So if you also cook, it'd be a plus and a great bonding activity in addition to movies, walks, long drives, stargazing at night! :D

I’m an optimistic, reflective, easygoing and a fun-loving person in general. I try to find meaning in every experience I have. I'm generous with appreciating others. The smallest things give me joy. I'm also firm with my boundaries with people.

I absolutely LOVE animals and have a few pets myself (a cat and birds). They keep my heart so full. Still wish I could have many more :( I cherish quality family time and hangouts. Definitely not brand-conscious and I don’t watch the brain-numbing news (I do stay updated on world events though). Personally, I live and let live and expect the same from my spouse.

I’m inclined towards rationality, facts and logic; so not an idealist. I’m less of an outdoorsy person and enjoy indoor activities much more. But I would still love to travel and explore new experiences with my spouse for sure.

All in all, I’m a desi girl at heart, with a generous mix of western touch of course. I identify more with traditional values (while keeping a good balance with the other side too) and don’t subscribe to radical feminism of today (things have gone so wrong there! - think: misandry). I rather concur with the original ideology of feminism and female empowerment – one that Islam also very aptly and rationally embodies.

In interpersonal relations, I always communicate and discuss things that bother me and never sweep things under the rug or pretend nothing happened. It’s only fair that I expect the same openness and maturity from my spouse.

I can’t stand people who don’t keep their word (in personal lives or professionally), i.e. they tell you they’ll do something and then they don’t.

**Bottom Line**

To sum up, I’m looking for a caring, intellectual, self-aware, humble, respectful and emotionally available man with a strong ""sense of commitment"". A leader, a man who I can look up to with utter respect and admiration. I'm looking for marriage as the end result, not a casual anything that goes nowhere. I wish to find someone who's my safe space and I'm his. Someone with whom I can make all the dumb jokes and laugh at the silliest memes together - a best friend for life ;) Hopefully, someone who loves and adores animals as much as I do. And obviously, I’ll also reciprocate everything that I mentioned above without question.

P.S. No description can completely acquaint you with a person, but I tried to cover all the pertinent points. If I still missed something, you can ask me.

Nobody is perfect, and I'm sure as hell not! I know it can be overwhelming, but if you think we may be compatible, let's talk and explore. Take a chance!

Note: Please mention your profile when you message. And please stay away if you’re not looking to seriously settle down or suffer from a bad case of commitment issues, or tend to ghost or just have poor online social etiquette.

With a profound decision like marriage, let's vet each other first. Once it’s apparent that we’re a good match, parents will definitely be involved for sure.

Bht bht shukria for having the patience to read through this long ass post. I know, I feel ya!

May Allah make it easy for all of us, give us partners who we really deserve and help bring out the best in each other! Ameen

Cheers!

1iymdao,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1iymdao/joe_k_part_9/,Joe K - Part 9,"""Nice to meet you,"" said Pearl Goolie. ""Please, take a seat. Sorry about the mess, I haven't had a chance to finish unpacking yet."" Broker had explained on the way over that the politician had just arrived in Glowbridge to contest the recently available parliamentary seat vacated by Hogarth Stone. There was much speculation about the reason for his untimely resignation, the press release merely eluding to personal health matters, but, whatever it was, the majority of the minority who actually care about local politics were an unsettled crew, suddenly cast adrift in the windy waters of woke without their captain at the helm. For nearly thirty years he had been defending real values, canvassing real votes and, perhaps most importantly, symbolising the impossibility of any real change in the minds of people who might consider voting against him. It was one of the safest seats in the country, which was why he'd continued to be tolerated by a leadership increasingly at odds with his antiquated personal views. The resignation they got was not as damaging as the defection he'd been plotting, but it was still a big problem for them. Stone had skilfully managed his career, securing the perpetual loyalty of his core support, but, given his rebellious reputation, it was often at the expense of their loyalty to the party. What was an extremely safe constituency, was now an extremely marginal constituency facing a snap by-election. Hence, Pearl Goolie. ""I've heard a lot about you, Joe, and I'd like to help you.""

""I'd appreciate that but, from what Bro tells me, you must be an extremely busy woman at the moment. I don't mean to be rude, but why would you take the time to help me?""

""Because you can help me,"" she bluntly replied.

""That seems unlikely, how?"" said K, wondering why he was being so defensive with this person, who, at least, was a lot more charming than the last politician he'd met. Goolie, however, seemed to understand his apprehension, and was considering how best to answer his question, when her personal assistant came in with the coffees. To make room on the desk for his, K had to pick up three framed photographs that had yet to find a permanent home in her new office.

""That's my partner, Kara, and our little girl, Lily. That's my paternal grandparents. They met on the boat, coming over from Trinidad. They faced poverty and racial discrimination their whole lives, but they never complained, just worked hard and raised six children - my father is the second eldest. That's him with my mother. *They* never stopped complaining, and campaigning, and marching, and fighting for the cause. I grew up with them dividing their time between the struggle to raise awareness and the struggle to raise us kids. Of course, in their day it was all about equality and community, now it's all about diversity and identity. And that's how you can help me, Joe. I'm widely perceived as a diversity candidate but, ironically, it's my perceived lack of diversity that could cost me votes in this town. Do you see what I mean?""

""Not exactly.""

""My reputation for championing the disenfranchised has served me well, but it's in danger of turning against me. If you google my name, and that's what people will do as soon as they see it on a campaign poster, you'll find comments such as 'she only cares about blacks and lesbians,' or words to that effect. I need to diversify and I need to do it quick, and that's where you come in, Joe. You have the identity to improve my diversity.""

""I didn't think I had much of an identity at all, until I was identified as a criminal.""

""Then we need to re-identify you as a victim.""

""Do I have to be one or the other?""

""If we want the media to pay attention, then yes. And the only way to influence the police is to put pressure on them through the media. Do you remember Omar Maraaba?""

""No, sorry.""

""Don't be, his story is typical enough, unfortunately, to have disappeared into the background noise by now. He was a nineteen-year-old Palestinian who came here on a scholarship a few years ago. An intelligent, dedicated student who also volunteered in a Mosque and worked in a takeaway, sending every spare penny he had back home to help his younger sister with her own education. But he made one mistake - he went on a protest march. The official story was that he died during a violent clash with the police initiated by a fringe element in the crowd. Many who were there disputed this, but it was their word against the authorities and no CCTV footage could be found to corroborate either interpretation, so no investigation was launched. Then, a few weeks later, a Conshop manager was going through some footage, looking for a local woman they suspected of shoplifting, when he spotted something. At first, he was angry with his assistant for failing to close the shutters, as he'd been instructed to do because of the protest, but then he saw a man being dragged into the alley and beaten by three police officers. Not sure how significant a find this was, and which official channel he could trust, the footage eventually ended up in the hands of an amateur film technician, who managed to clean it up enough to be able to identify Omar and two of the police officers. Convinced they had incriminating evidence, they handed it over to the police. Fortunately enough, they had enough sense to make a copy and, when it became obvious that no action was going to be taken, they posted it on the internet and sent the link to various television news stations and mainstream media outlets. It was this that forced their hand and the two serving police officers were immediately suspended and charged with causing grievous bodily harm. They both refused to cooperate with the investigation, of course, so the third officer was never identified and neither could be charged with manslaughter - both served less than a year. They were granted anonymity but one of them chose to waive it and now hosts a popular anti-immigration podcast.""

""What about the cover-up? wasn't that investigated?"" said K.

""We tried but... not in the media's interest equals not in the public interest.""

""So that was the end of it?""

""I saw his sister at the trial. Well, I only saw her eyes - the pretty face I'd seen in a photograph discovered amongst Omar's few possessions was now hidden from the public. 'We thought he'd be safe here,' she said. I asked her how her studies were going. 'Studies?' she said, as if such a concept was beyond comprehension. 'I was selfish then, I was ignorant. Now I know who our enemies are, I must help my brothers and sisters to fight them. It is God's will'. There *are* no ends, Joe, there are only consequences.""

""Shit,"" K didn't know what else to say, so Goolie changed the subject.

""Now, about you. There's a doctor we'd like you to see..."" She looked at Broker.

""Dr Sinha,"" he said.

""Yes, Dr Sinha. A solid medical diagnosis will certainly help draw attention to your case and speed things up a bit, at the very least. Our mutual friend, here, will give you the details. Now, as you pointed out, I'm an extremely busy woman at the moment, so I'll let my assistant show you both out and we'll speak again, soon.""

In the car, on the ride back to his flat, K was particularly quiet, even for him. Weirdly, it wasn't the thought of his case being used in an election campaign that particularly bothered him. He was sure that Pearl Goolie would make a much better MP than Hogarth Stone, and probably better than whoever she was going to be running against, and he was happy to help. There remained the distinct possibility of unwelcome media attention, but at least Goolie's plan, as far as he could tell from Broker's vague explanation, was a bit more low-key than a full blown national scandal. So what *was* bothering him?

""Relax,"" said Broker. ""Stone was... a mistake. Everything's going to work out with Pearl, she's one of the good ones.""

""I'm not worried about Pearl Goolie, I like her. I mean, she seems honest enough, for a politician. She talked to me like I was an equal, she looked at me like I was... an entity. I trust her. I guess we were lucky the old bastard resigned."" From Broker's physical reaction, which even K, with his limited ability to read body language, was able to pick up on, he had the distinct feeling of having just put his foot in it. ""Shit, I'm sorry, that was uncalled for, I forgot he was your friend - is he... seriously ill?""

""He's not my friend!"" It was the first time K had seen any hint of anger in Broker's congenial demeanour, and he realised that the journalist, himself, had been very quiet since they'd left Goolie's office, and even during the meeting itself. Am I your friend? thought K. What do friends do? In his head, he practised asking - ""Are you OK?"" or - ""Do you want to talk about it?"" but it just sounded forced and somehow like he was a character in a soap opera or a contestant on a reality TV program trying to make the audience believe they're a nice person who actually gives a shit about the rival celebrity-wannabe they've just met. On the other hand, the tension in the car was slowly becoming unbearable. He had to say something soon if he was going to salvage this new relationship.

""You know, I didn't know what to expect when you first suggested involving him and when I met him... wow, talk about a right-wing cliche. I'm not much for politics, but I was raised in a very left-wing environment, my dad...""

""Do you know what the real difference is between the left-wing and the right wing?"" said a still raging Broker, his eyes steadfastly fixed on the road ahead. ""The one thing everyone agrees on is that there's loads of bad, evil shit in the world, right? - that's one headline that isn't going to sell any newspapers. Left-wingers want all that evil shit to go away from the world and right-wingers want all that evil shit to go away from their neighbourhood - that's the only difference. And all the left-wing media want to do is sell newspapers to left-wingers and all the right-wing media want to do is sell newspapers to right-wingers. So they each tell their readers what they want to hear and keep reinforcing it. The right-wing media tell them that all the bad, evil shit is caused by immigration and gender identification and liberalisation, and the left-wing media tell them it's all caused by racism and sexism and capitalism. And they all tell everyone it's caused by the Russians and the Chinese because they don't have a *free press* like we do.""

""And they call *me* cynical... at least, they used to call me cynical, now..."" K stopped himself before he could aimlessly drift into self-deprecation. Although he was as bad at building friendships as he was at maintaining them, he suspected that self-deprecation was not the best way to go about it, and besides, there was no way someone like Broker would ever respect a man who shies away from an argument. K looked at his reflection in the wing mirror and gave himself a silent pep talk, before going for it. ""Anyway, that's not entirely true, is it? I mean, the press are also there to hold the government to account, even if they might disagree with each other about which party needs to be held to account.""

""The only time they'll genuinely hold anyone to account is when they do agree. Despite what some people think, there are a lot of amazing politicians out there - I know a few, and you've just met one, yourself. What amazes me most is how they manage to drag their arses out of bed every morning to work like hell, under extremely stressful conditions, just to fight for any small improvement for ordinary people, within a system that's almost always fighting against them, and without any chance of ever getting any real power because they don't kiss enough arses. You see, we don't live a meritocracy, we live in a sycophantocracy."" They were silent for the rest of the journey and, when he pulled up outside the north-east entrance to Malevich Square, Broker anxiously rummaged around in his glovebox and came out with Dr Sinha's card. ""Give her ring now, and make an appointment, we need to get moving on this... And I'm sorry about the rant, Joe, it's nothing personal, I guess I just got up on the wrong side of the world this morning.""

""No problem, Bro, and thanks, I do appreciate everything you're doing for me, I owe you one,"" K forced himself to say, desperate for a friendly reaction that didn't come. Whatever he had done to create this tension between them, he was determined to make amends.

Once inside the square, he caught sight of, then quickly pretended he hadn't, a zephyr smoking a rolled-up cigarette outside the doorway of East Block. Sensing a presence behind him, he walked across the front of North Block and up the path. In his shaking hand, the key took four attempts to find the lock, while he waited for his name to be called, or his shoulder to be tapped, or his head to be... He slowly walked towards the bottom of the stairwell until he heard the telltale click of the door closing behind him, then half-turned his head for visual confirmation that he was alone inside the building. Then he fully turned his head, to double-check the conclusions of his half-turned-head and satisfy himself that the humanoid movements it might have seen through the frosted glass were just his imagination playing tricks on him. Partially relieved, but still in a state of mental agitation, his mind full of nervous energy and confused thoughts, he failed to register Katie's polite, lukewarm greeting on the stairs until she'd passed him by. On realising what had happened, he felt the urge to apologise for accidentally ignoring her, but she was already on her way out of the block and it didn't feel right to go running after her, especially with a potential threat lurking in the shadows, so he ran up to his flat instead.

Through the window, he caught sight of her exiting the square onto Kandinsky Street, probably going to the Conshop for cigarettes. The zephyr was nowhere in sight, but the brief glance he'd got outside had left an after-image in his head of a toothless grin, convincing him that it had to have been the real deal, this time. He went to check his answering machine but there was no flashing light indicating a new message. Is that a good sign or a bad sign? he asked himself. Should I phone him now and pretend I hadn't seen him? pretend I've just got back home after being away for a few days? pretend I want to be friends? He picked up the phone... and slammed it back down. Maybe I should wait a few hours so it looks less like I'm doing what I'm doing... But this is exactly what I might be doing if I'd just gotten home and found his messages, right? He picked up the phone... and slammed it back down. ""Idiot!"" If he saw me just now, then he knows I didn't have a bag with me, so I couldn't have been away for a few days... And why should I pretend I want to be friends with him, anyway? what good would that do? And what if he doesn't even want to be friends any more? what if he's been reading that shit about me on the internet and he's decided I'm a satanic paedophile? what if I'm the new arch-nemesis in his fucking superhero fantasy?... ""Why did I have to make friends with a paranoid schizophrenic? - shit, what if I'm the paranoid schizophrenic?... Maybe I should see a doctor.""",1,1740572856.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

i (27M) celebrated my Birthday in Amsterdam last year in November and wanted to bring my Sisters (24 and 18) and my girlfriend with me.
I drove there and took them with me.
My Dad payed for everything as a birthday present for me. 
The First day we arrived in the evening and I wanted to see the City and Maybe go to a museum. 
We stayed for 3 days and my plan was to do some sightseeing and thought we would do it together as kind of a little family trip.
My sister (24) had other plans and asked me if it’s ok for me if they go shopping. I told them that it’s ok but my plan in the beginning was to do the trip together and experience everything together and have some nice memories. 
They just ended up doing shopping all day. 
Me and my girlfriend did some sightseeing alone. 
The day we drove back my sisters (24) was a bit weird to me and seemed annoyed I didn’t think much of it because the evening before was my birthday dinner and everything was fine.

We then drove off back home and on the way someone in front of me hit the brakes for no reason and I had to overtake/dodge his car. My sister had her coffee in the cup holder in the middle in the back row piece and it flipped over in to her bag. 
She started screaming at me and asked why I am driving that way and that I should watch out for them.
I got angry and told her everything that annoyed me the whole trip, and that I’m not responsible for her drinks and that she has to watch out where to keep them because I could also hit the breaks heavily any second if someone in front of me would do the same. 
We had a discussion and stopped talking to each other.
I have a long distance friend and visited him for a dinner on the way back home. 
My sister was so pissed and straight up ignored him even though he asked her questions and talked to her.



I know that I’m the older brother and my mom tells me to go apologise to her but in this case I don’t think that I want to do the first step towards her (correct me if I’m wrong) , because it was my birthday trip ( I did her a favor for even taking her with me) and it didn’t end up like I expected it, the other thing is that she talked with a really bad attitude and started that shit even though I didn’t do it on purpose (flipping her cup over) .",2,1740572787.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I (28M) have had a crush on this girl (24F) at work for months. We work in the same office space but for different companies. We’ve never really had a personal conversation, just the usual “hello,” “goodbye,” and occasional smiles.


Back in Nov-December, she was the one who seemed to start things. She’d stare at me frequently (once staring at me like 5 times in not even 5mn), smile and even came to my office door (without any real reason) just to say, “Happy holidays” before Christmas. At that point, we had never really spoken. Note that she doesn’t speak at all to any other people from my company.

Over the months, we’ve had so many moments—eye contact, glances, double glances, even blushes at some point/slight awkwardness when crossing paths. It wasn’t just in my head; even some coworker noticed.

But despite all that, we never really talked.

I got the impression that she’s quite reserved, especially around me. Even in december there was a week where she would stare at me for prolonged period of times, then a week where she would act like I don't exist (literally), and then the last workday of the month she went to greet me happy holidailys just before leaving, out of the blue. WTF

So onemonth ago I went to see her and introduce myself, asking what job she does. She basically did the same stuff. I thought it was awkward, but since then she's been greeting me everyday, sometimes even when I don’t really notice her.

A couple of weeks ago, I randomy heard her coworkers saying that she was sick for a week, so I sent her a quick “Hope you feel better, get well soon"" kind of message on Teams. She took six days to reply with a simple, “Hey ! Thank you very much that's nice of you” It wasn’t cold, but it wasn’t particularly warm either. Note that at this point it was probably obvious to her I had a crush. We’re on the same network but I had to dig to find her profile.

That response made me doubt everything, but at the same time, she kept initiating “hellos” and “goodbyes” after she came back to the office, even making eye contact with me randomly and smiling.

So, last week, I finally decided to break the cycle and sent her a message on Teams, inviting her for a casual coffee. I phrased it in a super low-pressure way, even giving her an easy out.
I wanted to invite her IRL, but considering the workplace, it's very hard to not be around coworkers, and people in both companies really don’t talk a lot to each other, I'd even say there are casual beefs lol.


The problem now:

It’s now been 4 days, and she hasn’t opened or responded to the message.

She’s been acting normal at work, but the unanswered message is just there.


What I don’t understand:

If she’s not interested, why not just say “no” politely? I literally gave her an easy way to decline, saying that if she doesn’t really have the time there is no problem.

If she is interested, why ignore the message?

Could she just be avoiding it because she doesn’t know what to say?

Am I overthinking, or is she just not interested and avoiding rejection altogether?
There is some part in me that tells me I was just imagining stuff all along, but then the rational part in me CANNOT think that she wasn’t interested in some way or another.

I don’t want to create awkwardness, but the silence is making things weird. Should I just let it go? How should I act if she never replies? Would appreciate any insights.

And btw, I'm happy I did this move if anything. Kinda relieved, despite everything. Surely the fact that we work at the same place but not the same company doesn’t make the thing completely unbearable, it's just awkward and frustating.",2,1740572778.0,datingadvice,4,1.0,False

I would order a large iced macchiato with 5 caramel swirl. 

To re-create it at home, I bought the actual Dunkin caramel swirl online, use whole milk, and currently use Starbucks espresso grounds. But it still doesn't taste the same as when I would would order from Dunkin, so something is off. And I'm betting it's the espresso grounds.

So I'm wondering if anyone knows what coffee beans Dunkin uses for their espresso drinks? I tried searching online but haven't been able to find an answer. Thanks!",3,1740572435.0,DunkinDonuts,2,1.0,False

They continued in the quietude of their own thoughts. His right hand was on her leg. Her hand was on his. He turned onto another back road that appeared on the BMW’s GPS as a nameless, thin line that would take them past the capital of Helena.

He wondered if John Taylor was in that city, plotting a way to capture Francis. More than likely, he was in Washington, DC, preparing for his big role in the new administration. Men like Taylor, with their own private armies, could fuck with you from afar.

Mickey hadn’t voted, and for that he felt guilty, but he blamed it on the snow and the fact that his client had just been accused of massacring six deputies and four Gretas. Not that his one lawyerly vote mattered anyway. When it came to presidents, Montana always pulled hard right. Even with the knowledge that Jane Allgood was a lesbian with a wife, a hot one at that, Montana still voted her in by a substantial margin.

_Why am I doing this?_ The question had been batting around in his head. Officially, since Francis was a federally wanted person, Mickey had stopped representing him. He had no obligation to even think about the kid anymore, not to mention Alan and Gwen. All he needed to do was get another client and continue with life. And maybe he would have, or more precisely, maybe the old Mickey would have done that.

Everything had changed during that concert. He simply couldn’t explain what was going on, or the exact nature of the change, but that night Francis’s music had carried him away, and the rain… The rain had washed him. The rain had fallen in a torrent from clouds just a few feet above his head, inside of a building. He remembered letting it pool in his hands and then throwing it on his face.

It was past midnight when he pulled off the road onto a gravel easement at the interchange that connected his nameless path with the great Interstate 90. It would have easily carried them to Billings right on schedule, but in the distance, the flickering lights of another roadblock filled the sky with a dome of color.

He bypassed I-90 and entered the little town of Three Forks, all closed down past midnight anyway, except for a lonely service station, its neon sign flickering in the dark. He cruised down the main drag, abandoned buildings and burnt-out houses flicking by like film strip. Times were about as tough around here as they were back up in the Mission Valley.

On the far side of the little hamlet, he came to a motel with a decaying sign: _Lewis & Clark Sportsmen’s Lodge_. From the ambient history lessons he’d received by dint of living in the Big Sky State, he knew of the two early American explorers who had trekked through Montana on their voyage to discover a route to the Pacific Ocean. From Charbonneau’s Grill to Sakagawea Dresses, every other business appropriated something from that long-ago cadre.

“Where are we, baby?” Foxy asked sleepily.

“Three Forks.”

“I’ve never heard of it.”

“Headwaters of the Missouri River. There’s a roadblock up on the interstate. I say we get a room here and crash. Head out at first light down the back roads.”

Foxy held his arm as they climbed the front steps to the door. “It looks pretty dark. They open?”

It was locked. Mickey pressed the doorbell. Somewhere deep inside, he heard a buzzer go off. They waited in the cold for a few minutes, and he pushed the button again.

“Ahh,” Foxy gasped, yanking on his arm.

A figure stood on the other side of the glass door. A short man in a flannel jacket with messy hair and a wild beard peered at them suspiciously, then opened the door just an inch.

“We’re closed for the season.”

“Wait,” exclaimed Mickey. “We just need to rest a few hours. I’ll pay cash.”

The man stared at him without a word.

“Double your rate,” he added.

He came out on the porch and looked up and down the road. “It’s not a good night,” he mumbled.

“Please,” said Foxy. She was shivering.

The man smiled, showing broken teeth and a glint of gold.

Mickey pulled her close.

“I guess.” He scanned the road again and went inside. A neon light buzzed on: _No Vacancy_.

In the lobby was a muted television tuned to the Weather Channel, and a gas fireplace built into the wall. Its flames licked a red-glowing iron log. He felt the heat on his skin. Next to the fireplace, a broad staircase ascended into darkness. On the counter to the office vestibule was a lamp with a Victorian shade skirted by ruby tassels; it cast the rustic innkeeper in a velvet glow.

“Fifty dollars,” the man said. A boozy fragrance wafted from his person. Mickey handed him the money, which he promptly put in his pocket. “201 at the top of the stairs.” He held out a key attached to a vintage maroon fob, upon which, leafed in gold, was the motel’s name and the same logo that adorned the signage—the intrepid Lewis and Clark, walking sticks in hand, one of them pointing off stage to the boundless western expanse.

“Thanks. I appreciate it,” said Mickey. “So many cops on the road tonight. What’s going on?”

“Yeah, there’s a manhunt,” slurred the clerk.

“Oh really? Who are they after?”

“They’re not saying. Someone they want really bad. Check out is by eleven. I usually have coffee on by five.”

The stairs creaked under their weight.

“I don’t think I’ve ever used a real key in a hotel before,” said Mickey as he fumbled with the lock.

Room 201 smelled both clean and unused for a long time. The beige carpet bore an ancient stain that had been thoroughly sanitized but not removed, leaving the ghost of speculation at some past fluidic tragedy—a bottle of wine, vomit, clandestine abortion.

Foxy flopped down on the bed, moaned, and stretched out the stiffness of the car ride. “I could sleep for ten hours.”

“We only have about four. Get some rest. I’m going to get the bags and the guitar in from the car.”

In the lobby, the man was sitting in a large leather chair in front of the fire. A Christmas tree twinkled behind him. The TV still played the weather channel.

Outside, the wind hit his face with a cold blast. Above, the moon was high and full, and only the brightest stars shone through the reach of its halo. He carried the box containing the guitar with one arm, and in the other, his and Foxy’s travel bags.

“Could we get a wake-up call at five-thirty?”

The clerk got up without speaking, went behind the counter, and punched something into a phone panel on the desk.

“Set,” he said. His eyes caught the broken guitar. “You play?”

“Oh, this old thing. Nah, it’s a friend’s. Got busted. Think I can get it fixed in Billings.”

“I can look at it if you want,” said the man. His voice was raspy. He coughed and spit into a cup.

Mickey wondered if he should put on a mask.

“You know guitars?”

“Yeah. I’ve dabbled. I’m pretty good with my hands.”

One of the arts of being a lawyer was knowing how to read people. Words themselves were the most deceiving things, spewed from the mouth by the unconscious censor that was always trying to keep the mythology going. But if you could look past that to the body, the gesture of the hand, and the subtle eye movement, one could divine the source of honesty. This man’s eyes, despite his words, had registered the guitar instantly. His hand had twitched, as if his fingers were already caressing the strings.

Mickey went with his gut. “Yeah, go for it,” he said.

He put the box on the counter, and the man gently touched the smashed instrument with reverence, tracing two fingers along the faded blue wood.

“Someone really fucked it up,” he said. “It’s a nice one. Very old. Handmade. Very, very old.”

“Yeah. We think we can find a repair shop in the city.”

“No!” he said sharply. “There’s no one there who knows how to work on this guitar. I’ll fix it for you.” He carefully turned the guitar over. “I’ll fix this,” he whispered.

“So, you live out here?” Mickey said to break the silence, nervous about leaving Francis’s guitar with a stranger and possibly a heavy drug user, if his teeth were any indication.

“No. I work for the company. I just come out here when it snows to shovel the walks and keep out the vagrants.”

“It’s not snowing,” said Mickey.

“It will.”

“There’s not even a cloud in the sky.”

“It will snow.” The man looked at him with intense eyes. “Look,” he came around the counter and approached the TV. There was a map on the screen, and a woman was indicating a large area of snowstorms in northern Canada. The sky over Montana was clear sailing for the next several days. Mickey counted on this for a romantic night stroll of the city, gazing atop the rimrocks with the luscious Foxy on his arm. “This here,” said the man, indicating the same clouds as the woman on screen. “This is gonna hit us pretty good in a few hours.”

Mickey saw no indication that this storm was going to even hit the populous parts of Canada, let alone Montana. “I think we’re pretty safe from that,” Mickey said. “That’s way up there.”

“What, you a scientist or something?” The man grinned, showing brown and broken teeth and the glint of his gold tooth through his scraggly beard.

“No, but you don’t have to be a scientist to see that’s not going to touch us,” Mickey persisted. For the life of him, he didn’t know why he was arguing the chances of snow with this guy. “I don’t feel it in my trick knee.”

The look from the man was stern. “Trick knee, huh?”

Mickey shrugged.

The man smiled and then cackled. “This is gonna be the biggest one yet. It’s gonna snow so hard those pigs will need to go home and get warm.”

“Well, I hope it doesn’t snow. We need to get to Billings tomorrow.”

“You’ll make it. You just gotta take it slow and steady. Don’t brake too hard. No quick accelerations.”

“Right, well, I’m off to get a few winks,” Mickey said. “I guess, don’t worry about the guitar. I’ll find a place tomorrow.” He was having second thoughts.

“I’ll fix it. I’ll goddamn fix it.” The man’s voice quivered. He picked up the guitar and cradled it in his arms like a broken infant, watching suspiciously as Mickey climbed the stairs.

“Crazy bastard,” Mickey murmured under his breath.",1,1740572423.0,HFY,2,0.67,False

I have worked as a chef in a commercial kitchen (food to order from websites). It became extremely overwhelming due to workload per person in the past few weeks (after the company got sold to a much bigger company) and I literally started panicking etc. whenever an evening came and I knew I have to go there the next morning.

I was under an enormous amount of stress basically, could barely sleep for a few weeks and so on and simply know that I won't be able to work 1 more day is said place. I honestly felt like a miserable s*it working there recently and the ignorant and very sarcastic new management wasn't helping my mental health either.

Anyway, I gave my resignation letter last Friday. The notice period is 4 weeks. 
I have been out sick due to work related stress for slightly over a week now and I already feel much better overall. I started sleeping normally again and feel happier.

I started applying to coffee shops and got an offer for an assistant manager position in one of them. 
The coffee shop in question is a small, private shop which isn't getting very busy etc. as I have been going there personally for quite some time to grab a coffee.

I know personally that this environment was and will be FAR less stressful for me; I've worked in coffee shops for quite a few years in the past and ended up in this current place simply due to being desperate while job hunting.


Could anyone possibly help me in this situation? What are my options? I have already mentioned in the resignation letter that I give it due to ""personal problems"" and that I will provide a doctor's note for the notice period.

I'd really appreciate some help, as I was never in such a situation before, but maybe someone else was and could potentially help me.

And I think that I came to a point that I'm greatly overthinking this whole situation?
To be honest, the managers didn't even reply to me after I send the resignation letter and I did it 5 days ago 🤔.",1,1740572299.0,LegalAdviceUK,5,1.0,False

He pressed a button and felt the BMW shift into four-wheel drive and grip the snow-packed road of the mountain’s pass. “Thank you, darling,” he whispered. It was Foxy who had made the last-minute decision to purchase the studded snow tires that had become crucial in their frantic escape from under the surveillance of the sheriff’s department and the JTS goons.

Like everyone else, Mickey had fallen under the illusion that the beautiful waitress was just another stereotypical airhead—a nice set of jugs in an ass-gripping uniform serving coffee and hotcakes to the valley regulars.

He mentally kicked himself for not seeing it a long time ago, for lusting after her and objectifying her when, in reality, she was a highly intelligent woman with an incredible gift. That trick back at the gas station—his body still tingled a little bit—was all her, part of her magic. Now he realized it had been so from that day five years ago when she had poured him his first cup of coffee, licked her glittering lips, and called him _Shug_. She was working that magic, creating the reality in which she could live while hiding from those things… those fucking monsters.

She slept now in the seat next to him, her features caressed by the soft glow of the dashboard; his companion, his co-conspirator. She had put herself in danger for the sake of Francis and the hope and promise of his music. Yet it wasn’t solely for this boy. He knew in his gut—it was also for him. For some inexplicable reason, this breathtaking damsel had taken a risk on a fat, bald lawyer from Nowhere, Montana. Now, like Alan, Wolf, and Francis, they were fugitives from justice. The understanding suddenly dawned that his old life was gone forever. He would never practice law again. At that instant, Mickey vowed that he would do anything to protect her.

The car behind him flashed its brights, its beams cutting through the snow. He decided he was just going to keep driving. They could either pass him or follow him. There was no way in hell he was going to pull over.

At that instant, his rear-view mirror lit up with red and blue flashing lights.

“Shit.”

He pulled to the side of the road and stopped. Behind him, the cop blasted a spotlight into his side mirror. He put his hands on the wheel and waited for the officer to knock on his window.

How had they caught them so quickly? No doubt, as soon as they realized he had made a run for it, they’d gone to all the rental agencies in town. From there, it would have been like putting a child’s puzzle together: off-grid rental, paid in cash under the name of the mother of the waitress he’d taken to the Halloween ball. How stupid could he be?

He could make a run for it, but even if he lost the cop, they would radio ahead and be waiting for him.

“Fuck!”

The spotlight went dark. The cruiser beeped its horn, swung around him, and took off up the pass.

“Christ.”

Foxy turned in her sleep, her ample bosom rising and falling. He didn’t keep driving until he could no longer see taillights and no longer felt like a heart attack lurking just below the surface.

Thirty minutes later, he cleared the mountain pass. The snowstorm diminished to little angry flakes of ice, and a mile later to nothing. The mountains played their natural role of blocking the low-pressure systems from crossing into the flatlands of eastern Montana.

The highway stretched out long and far beneath him. The sky forward was speckled with stars like diamonds that faded into the horizon, back-lit by a moon on the verge of rising.

_Clear skies at night, Maji in flight_.

He drove in silence and stillness, taking comfort in the expanse of dark highway stretching to the future and to the past. He drove on as the first splinter of silver broke the far horizon of land and cloud. Larger and larger, it grew like the hump of a great whale diving into the cosmos, washing away the stars and revealing the prairie beneath its ascending glare.

“You didn’t need to let me sleep,” Foxy said, arching her back.

He tried to look at her s-line and keep his eyes on the road at the same time.

“Eyes forward! You’re gonna get us killed.”

“No. _You’re_ gonna get us killed.” He reached out to touch her. She captured his hand, guiding it to her tit. She was bra-less in a t-shirt.

“You like that?” she asked.

“I do,” he said. “Damn, I wish my old man was alive to see you. He never would’ve believed it. He thought I was gay for the longest time.”

“Forget him, baby.” She moved his hand over to her other breast and let him feel the rise of her nipple, then pushed him back and sat up. “Where are we?”

“Some podunk back road out in the middle of nowhere.”

“Wow, the moon is so bright. It almost hurts my eyes.”

He drove with his headlights off. The old asphalt road glinted like a sterling ribbon out into the terrestrial sea before them. Only once did they spot a checkpoint on the highway that ran parallel, a long line of cars waiting to pass through a blaze of flashing red and blue lights.

Hours passed, and the gravel back road slowly angled toward the highway, where traffic now moved unobstructed. Ahead, he saw the on-ramp and pulled over on a turn-off.

“Why ya stopping?” asked Foxy.

“Need to drain the main vein.”

“What?”

“Gotta take a piss, honey buns.”

With his dick in his hand, his shining stream of urine arched up and fell to the wayside. Even with the billions and billions of people on the earth, the vast emptiness of Montana never ceased to amaze him. So different from where he’d been raised. Hell, stop to take a piss back there, you’d be arrested and charged with a crime.

“No fair,” Foxy whined as he got back in. “You men can go anywhere.”

“That’s because we evolved as hunters. Always on the move, fighting off sabretooth tigers, we didn’t have time to squat, baby.”

“Wow, that sounds scientific. Sabretooth tigers?”

“Just go behind the car, drop trou, and use the bumper for support.”

“That’s so crude, dear.”

“It’s nature, sweetie pie.” He chuckled as she got out and went to the back.

“Don’t peek!” she shouted.

A thought had occurred as an inkling in his mind since fleeing Polson, and it kept growing until it was as big and illuminating as the nighttime moon. Why not? Why the fuck not? The world was going to hell. Water levels were rising. States were leaving the union. A war that had continued for his entire life was only getting worse. A drug crisis. Climate refugees crossing the country looking for a place to call home. And a whole raft of other shit. Why the fuck not? If not now, when? Maybe never.

He got out of the car and met Foxy on her way back.

“Hey, I told you not to peek, you perv.”

“I didn’t peek.”

“What is it? Is everything okay?”

Her beauty caught in the moonlight made her appear like a marble statue.

“Foxy.” Mickey Verona dropped to one knee on the gravel road before her, reaching up, he clasped her hand.

“Oh boy,” she said.

“Foxy, I’ve loved you since that morning in Dee’s when you poured me my first cup of coffee. I’m not a perfect man…” He lost his words. “But sometimes… Hell, Foxy, will you marry me?”

“Oh, Mickey. I—I mean, there’s so much about me you don’t know—I haven’t told you.”

“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “We move forward together.”

A tear rolled down her face, like a single star falling to Earth.

“Yes!” she said at long last. “Yes. Yes, Mickey! I will marry you!”

She fell to her knees and kissed him. Her lips warm and moist, her breath fresh as the night. Somewhere in the far-off distance, a coyote yelped and howled, and then a dozen yelps and howls echoed in response.",1,1740572186.0,HFY,2,0.67,False
1iym6b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1iym6b8/vision_is_blurry_but_its_not/,Vision is ''blurry'' but it's not?,"I've been having this issue for almost two years now.

I randomly woke up one day and had this ''drunk'' feeling vision wise, where as soon as I stood up I lost balance, it was pretty severe the first 2 weeks. I'm not sure what could of triggered it at all. I was thinking to myself, wtf had just happened, I didn't feel sick at all but was really confused why I was seeing all dizzy without feeling dizzy at all.

Ever since then I've been having this issue although over time the effects have diminished, it still present.

I tend to notice it would flare up when I'm stressed, when something spontaneous would happen in life, my vision would start to become affected. Some days I have zero issues thinking the problem went away on it's own only for it to come back the day after, it would sometimes last a couple hours to the whole day, while Sleeping/napping would ''reset'' it.

I got my eyes checked out, have perfect vision, no issues reading up close, small letters far away etc.

It's just really hard to explain how my vision is affected in words, but it's like having drunk goggles on permanently if that makes sense, less severe, My balance doesn't seem to be affected it seems.

I tried doing vestibular exercise such as focusing my eyesight on my finger point out while turning my head left and right and it seems to affect it more the tighter I turn (Fully left/right).

Is it my vestibular vision? I feel concerned as I'm only 27 and If im having this type of health issues due to stress I'm worried about the future, I also have a clean diet, I cut out energy drinks, and haven't eaten junk food in years. I only drink water and coffee in the morning and afternoon If I need it.

I've also started driving lessons and passing my exam start of next month, but never disclosed I have it to either the instructors nor my parents for fear or making excuses and extending the dates. My driving doesn't seem to be affected as much but I won't lie in saying it's really annoying, I have to concentrate to the max which in return after 2 hours of driving lessons my symptoms appear without fail each time and lasts the whole day mostly, almost mid way through my lessons it appears, but like I said, it's no where near severe where I have to stop.
