1lk6ode,https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lk6ode/madrinas_coffee_mural_offer_eu/,Madrinas coffee mural offer EU.,"Hello,

Recently I was on the main page, and noticed that there was a co-promo with Madrinas coffee, and Dune Awakening.  I went to the [web page](https://duneawakening.com/news/announcing-partnership-with-madrinas/) followed that link to the coffee's site, and tried to make the purchase, but they do not ship to Spain.

I'm not sure where else they ship (if they ship) in the EU, but I was wondering if there was a way for folks in the EU to get that mural for their Base?  It's a cool design, and it would be nice to have access to it.

If there is a similar cross promotion with an EU place that would be fine as well.

Hopefully, someone from Funcom may see this, and get us an answer from their marketing folks.

in general my hypo symptoms are cold intolerance, hairloss, weak nails. the ‚Äúattack‚Äù happens like once or twice a year. and happened more prior to my diagnosis. 

i noticed that caffeine might be a trigger for me. and i have stopped drinking coffee especially for a few years. this year i wanted to try coffee again cuz i wasnt sure if it is actually a trigger to the attack.

so today i drank coffee. and 1/2hours later i felt off. i feel slightly tired, breathing feels restricted but my heartbeat is fine. no palpitations yet. talking is hard cuz im like trying to catch my breath. like im trying to talk while running. 

is this a normal symptom for those with hypothyroid? like is caffeine bad for hypothyroid. and is it an actual trigger or is it just a coincidence this attack happened and i drank coffee the same day. 

cuz before this the attack happens on days where i did drank coffee or matcha, and there were days it just came randomly. but for it to happen again today while ive been on almost 3 years on levothyroxine, feels scary and idk if i should be concerned. what do i do? and does anyone have similar symptoms like mine?",1,1750860247.0,Hypothyroidism,0,1.0,False

I need some advice for which MacBook Pro model should I get.

I have an M1 MacBook Air 8Gb 256gb. Im having a quite heavy workload (150+ RAW photos editing on Lightroom classic, Photoshop, and 1080p60 video editing), so obviously, my MBA is not working.

In my country, Macs are expensive and have many taxes, so the pricing here is going to be a bit different, but anyways, after researching, I have too options:

1: A brand new base 14inch MacBook Pro M4 Pro. 24Gb, 512Gb. $2000

2: An used 16inch MacBook Pro, M1 Pro, 32Gb RAM upgraded, 512Gb. $1550

For shure, I appreciate the M4, but I‚Äôm a heavy RAM user, I can use up to 26Gb considering the swap. And the 16 inch size seems to be the one I prefer, because I use it a lot on desk and coffee shops, but I‚Äôm not shure.

1lk6h1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lk6h1n/i_went_to_school_to_be_a_park_ranger_i_quit_after/,I Went to School to Be a Park Ranger. I Quit After My First Job.,"It was always my dream to be a park ranger. I loved the outdoors. The birds and bees weren‚Äôt just a metaphor for me. They were my life‚Äôs passion. So when I graduated college with a degree in wildlife management, it felt like I‚Äôd finally arrived.

But then I couldn‚Äôt get a job. I sent application after application, hoping against hope I‚Äôd stand out among the hundreds of candidates vying for a single position. 

It goes without saying that as a new grad, my resume wasn‚Äôt the most impressive of the bunch. 

That changed when I got a personalized letter, typed on a typewriter and sent through the mail. It was an invitation to a job at a small state park I‚Äôd never heard of.  My former college advisor and I had already planned to get coffee that afternoon so I excitedly brought the letter to show her. 

Her smile went flat and her eyes dark when she saw the letterhead, and after scanning the text briefly, she handed it back with a terse expression.

‚ÄúTell them no.‚Äù

I blinked rapidly in shock, completely surprised at her reaction. ‚ÄúBut why? You know I‚Äôve been job searching for months, and this is the first time I‚Äôve gotten anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem odd to receive an offer for a job you never applied for?‚Äù I frowned. I didn‚Äôt have a good answer.

‚ÄúYou were one of my best students, and you deserve a job that‚Ä¶,‚Äù she trailed off, then shook her head slightly before continuing, as though trying to clear her mind of a disquieting memory. Her stare was intense when she began speaking again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a good offer. People I know say bad things have happened there. You have to trust me.‚Äù I promised I‚Äôd look into it more before deciding. 

When I got home, I checked Google and Yelp reviews. There weren‚Äôt many, which didn‚Äôt surprise me given I‚Äôd never heard of the park before, but they were all filled with enthusiastic praise. The trails were perfect. The weather was perfect. Everything was perfect. Then I reverse sorted to the most negative reviews stretching over several years. 

‚ÄúMy sister and her husband disappeared while hiking and no one cared.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy husband‚Äòs car broke down right outside the gates. He called and told me he was going to walk to the ranger station to get help, and never came back. Why isn‚Äôt anyone talking about this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is going to sound crazy, but I swear some of the signs were changed. We only found our way back because our daughter was pretending to be Hansel & Gretel and throwing Cheerios on the trail.‚Äù

I decided to sleep on it, but if I‚Äôm honest, I already knew what I‚Äôd decided. My bank account was running on fumes. I was jobless and loans were due and I was tired of eating ramen. And most times, people who became lost or injured in a park had it happen because they weren‚Äôt paying attention - either to the weather or the trails or their own bodies. 

The next day, I called the number on the letter, and a man who sounded old enough to be my father answered. He seemed enthusiastic - if not a little surprised - when I told him I was interested in the position, and I did a short interview that felt more like a formality. 

By the end of the call, he asked when I could start. I said I could throw everything in my car and be there by Tuesday.

""That's perfect,"" he said, and hung up.

The drive across country was both scenic and uneventful. After months of demoralizing job applications, I felt excited again. I was going to work! In my dream field! The only shadow to my good mood was my former advisor. After emailing to say I accepted the job, she wrote back almost immediately, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt do this. Something else will come up. I‚Äôll talk to the chair about letting you TA for me. Just don‚Äôt go.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to say, so I didn‚Äôt reply.

The directions I was given brought me to what would be my new home. I had my own small cabin inside the park. Just one room really with a bed, a kitchenette, a couch, and a TV that would be right at home on Antiques Roadshow. That didn't matter. I preferred to read anyway, and it was going to take some time to get up to speed on my new park. By the door was a whistle on a thick cord with a sign that said to only blow in case of emergencies. 

I stared at it a few moments, wondering about the presence of bears, then a knock at the door brought me out of my daze. Outside were 2 men and a woman, all old enough to my parents or maybe even grandparents, with warm smiles on their faces and several tote bags full of supplies to help me get started. 

They were effusive in their welcomes, which is how I learned they were all older than my grandparents, but each looked to be in perfect health. As they helped me set up, they spoke easily about the magic of the park and how it was time to get a new generation trained. I enthusiastically agreed that nature was magical and thanked them again for hiring me.

That first night, we sat around a special welcome campfire to ‚Äúofficially introduce‚Äù me to the park. As I added my name to an old book of previous rangers (full names only and no nicknames, they emphasized), I felt as though I was exactly where I wanted to be.

They spent the next few weeks orienting me to my new position. I shadowed them during days and evenings and spent any free time I had reading about the area. Still, my advisor‚Äôs final words lingered. Nothing seemed weird or wrong or out of the ordinary. Why the warning to stay away?

I loved working there. There were no accidents, no crimes, and no missing persons, despite what the negative reviews said. The trails seemed to maintain themselves. We had a steady flow of visitors. Even ‚Äúbad‚Äù weather days were good. I never got sick. Honestly, I'd never looked and felt healthier.

Then one late autumn night, at a team meeting over a campfire, I was told we'd spend the next few days taking down, hiding, redirecting, or otherwise changing the signs. They would be wrong for 3 days, then we‚Äôd make them right again.

""Oh this must be for some kind of maintenance, right?"" I asked, guileless. 

My three fellow rangers looked at me without smiles, their faces the most serious I‚Äôd ever seen. 

""No.""

""But there are people inside,‚Äù I replied, confused. ‚ÄúHow will they find their way out?‚Äù

Silence was my answer.

I looked to each of them, expecting someone to smile, to tell me it was a prank, to give me some kind of explanation. 

‚ÄúI don't get it.""

""The park demands a sacrifice,‚Äù one of the rangers, a woman named Sherri intoned. 

I laughed. ‚ÄúYou can't be serious.‚Äù 

At their continued stillness, my laugh subsided into a nervous smile, my eyes darting from face to face, waiting desperately for one of them to reveal it was a joke on the new ranger.

""Be ready at 7am,‚Äù Casey said before they all got up to leave. 

I shouted after them, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt DO this! There are people in there!!!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what I expected. Maybe guilt or shame. Maybe one of them realizing they‚Äôd taken the joke too far. Instead, Sherri just answered without looking back, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the idea.‚Äù 

I stared into the fire for a long time before finally putting it out. Human sacrifice? The parks were magical, but not that kind of magic. Right? 

Denial is a crazy thing. I think I still thought they were joking, at least until the next day.

""Keep your whistle on you,‚Äù Chip said as I followed him on the trail. ‚ÄúAs you're changing the signs, you might see something out the corner of your eye. Don‚Äôt look at it. By now, the park knows you, but if you get turned around and truly can‚Äôt find your way back, blow your whistle.‚Äú

My stomach was twisted into knots as we spent the next few days turning signs the wrong way, hiding them in brush, or taking them down all together. I can‚Äôt explain why I just went along with it. Maybe I was in kind of a daze. Maybe I still didn‚Äôt believe it. 

Every so often we'd see hikers or campers. I opened my mouth to speak one time, and Sherri glared at me so fiercely I temporarily forgot to breathe. Then, with the sweetest voice, she sent them in the wrong direction.

Afterwards, we had one last team meeting where I was instructed to stay in my cabin for the next three days and to open the door to no one.

I drank myself into a stupor with the absinthe a friend gifted me before I left as a play on me being a ‚Äúgreen fairy‚Äù in the park service. Despite working through a good portion of the bottle on an empty stomach, I didn't even wake up hungover. A fact that was so much more sinister now.

There was nothing of note the first two days. I‚Äôd almost started to convince myself that I must have been wrong or misheard. That this was some kind of trial period job test, maybe of my ability to follow directions. Then on the third night, so late it was almost morning, I heard screams getting louder as they approached my cabin. 

I wasn‚Äôt thinking when I opened my door. I wasn‚Äôt thinking when I shouted at the hiker to come inside. I wasn‚Äôt thinking when I left the safety of my threshold. I wasn‚Äôt thinking when I blew the whistle.

His shirt was torn and bloody, bruises and scratches on his face, and chunks of hair missing. His look of relief was heart wrenching. He ran towards me, our arms stretching towards each other, and then the forest‚Ä¶ate him. 

I don‚Äôt know any other way to describe it. The trees, the ground, the air‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like they came together in one giant maw and simply vanished him out of existence. I didn‚Äôt know what to say or think or do. I felt the forest looking at me. It was unhappy. Its warm, welcoming presence had gone ice cold. As I backed up to my cabin, I realized I‚Äôd done something very wrong. In the distance there was a rustle and the‚Ä¶entity simply dispersed, probably to chase new prey. 

The next day I threw everything I owned in my car and left without a word or note. And I finally texted my advisor. ""Avoid the parks,‚Äù she wrote back. 

‚ÄúWhich ones?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll of them.‚Äù

I haven't set foot in or near a park since. My country has so many of them, more than you‚Äôd think, that I mostly fly now. The last time I got too close, it's like I could feel the air bending my way, see the trees and rocks reaching for me. 

But I suppose it could be worse. I‚Äôm in a support forum for these kinds of happenings now. There‚Äôs one man who has to avoid any body of water larger than a sink. He hasn‚Äôt taken a bath in years.",3,1750860042.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1lk6ghu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thrifty/comments/1lk6ghu/how_to_reduce_your_grocery_bill/,how to reduce your grocery bill,"this might be helpful to some

To reduce groceries:

Some foods are way cheaper for the same nutritional value in the frozen aisle: corn, peas, string beans, brussel sprouts...etc mixed veggies. The other such as zucchinis/courgettes , mushrooms etc the texture is different than fresh but are great for soup /mash even risotto (mushroom).

Dry legumes : beans, chickpeas , lentils ... etc are way cheaper and healthier than canned(no added sugar at home and controlled salt input). They are a good source of protein. extra tip: you can soak them then freeze them, so they are ready when you want to cook them even on a whim!

An alternative to meat : dried soy proteins (tvp). Super cheap per kg and a kg is huuuuge because it is super light like popcorn.when cooked , many people mistake it for chicken. The texture is similar.

did you know that often the fish you buy in the produce section is defrosted fish? save yourself money and buy it cheaper frozen.

smaller fishes are healthier and for some way cheaper. try sardines and or mackerels. fresh or canned. they are delicious, relatively cheap (I would guess it depends on the country) and convenient.

Instead of buying tomato sauce (or pasta sauce it seems in some countries) the ones with seasoning and /or spices , buy tomato puree or diced tomatoes and season it, add you want. Here a tomato sauce is between 1$ to 3$ I buy the tomato puree 90cts for double the size. cheaper healthier and again no sugar, conservative, and other unhealthy things.

Buy tomato concentrate too for soups, red sauces , stew etc, even cheaper than the puree.

Cut the snacks and sugary sweets. If you have a sweet tooth make some easy ones at home. Oats slices, with apple sauce, peanut butter or berries, pancakes, crumble, oat cookies ... Many others like easy mugcakes etc..

for that buy flour and oats! Preferably wholewheat (or other like buckwheat, millet etc) more filling and healthier. No premix full of sugar, they are more expensive and too sweet.

Buy dry corn for pop corn. Pop it in the microwave in a brown bag for 1 to 2 minutes. Than flavor it. Super cheap lasts forever. make it sweet or savoury, no need to put butter.

Other way to make pop corn‚Ä¶ 2 Tbsp veg oil in a pot, head on medium high, when hot, add 1/3 cup kernels, put lid on and shake, so all the kernels get oiled. Give it a good shake every now and then, more frequently as it starts popping. Remove from heat when popping slows. Crack lid to let out steam and let those last couple of kernels pop. Pour into a big bowl & season to taste.

With the flour you can also make tortillas and add cheese, quesedillas for a snack. If you are lazy there are even liquid dough recipes.

Want chips? Make them. Just slice potatoes with a mandolin, wash them , drain the water then spread them in between towels to get rid if the moiture. Then fry them. Not super healthy but cheaper at least! You can try them in the oven but nor as crispy. You can do the same with beetroot so you will have purple sweet chips.

Cut the sweet beverages. If you must because you are too used to drink sweet things , just buy cordial/syrup waaaaaaay cheaper and last a long time. Add to water or soda water.

Make your own icetea by making a cold brew. Same for coffee. put in cold water and leave overnight in the fridge, filter : it's ready! same with infusion bags, mate , roibos ...etc. cold brew gives a less bitter coffee and tea.

You can also flavour your water just by squeezing lemon in the bottle, or adding few leaves of mint.infuse verbena or lemon myrtle. add berries...

Makes a list of the essentials before shopping and just grab those; it avoids getting tempted in the aisles and buying stuff not needed just because it is on sale.

Some things are way cheaper in big quantities. You just have to look and wait for a good price for them : like 5kg (or 10kg) of potatoes and onions. If stored properly they last months. Like I buy 5kg od onions for between 1$50/3 .... Just waited for the opportunity where usually you get a kg and half or a kg for the price. Same for potatoes.... Look at the local shops often you find the big bags of potatoes. I don't eat potatoes often only buy them sometimes when they are cheap like that.

If you have friends you can share stuff with and join grocery shopping that also helps. Can also mean saving on gas money. Using 1 car, everyone his/her turn! or look for a wholesale store or market might be even better.

Always compare the price per kilo you'll be surprised at some stuff.

Some supermarkets sell the bread half price at the end of the day, same with roasted chicken. Just buy and freeze it.

Apple sauce is a good alternative to eggs in many recipes and it adds a fruit and fiber and the end product is cheaper. but can be an alternative dessert too. buy unsweetened , preferably.

Avoid super sweet cereals replace by cornflakes , puffed rice or oats you can flavour them :cinamon, sugar, vanilla etc and add frozen berries. Cheaper healthier.

you can also make your granola with oats +apple sauce or mashed bananas , then add seeds, nuts and dry fruits/

If you want to try yogurt is super easy to make. Unstead of buying sweetened yogurt just cut fruits in it or add your own sugar.

If you find meat on sale even if the date is short. Buy it and freeze it in small quantities. Also with your friends you can buy 1, 1/2 or a quarter animal in some places cut it and split it if you have the courage. It us way cheaper. (Local farmers, some butcher, wholesale shops, some even send them if you order online)

You can also keep take advantage of cheese sales (like cheddar, emmental, Gruy√®re...etc) by shredding and freezing them in small packets. You can use in cooking directly from frozen or defrost a packet when needed.

Some orchards sell their uncalibrated fruits cheaper than the supermarket. You have to go get it but it us fresh and worth it. When it is something like apples even more since if stired properly they will last months.

One alternative to lettuce is witloaf/endives. It makes a nice salad and is way more cost effective. With apples and cubes of cheese it is delicious and with oranges it is super fresh!

You can grow your aromats on the kitchen window sill or in your garden. If you can get a mint root plant it pretty soom you will have a full planter. That is how it reproduces. Chives, thyme, rosemary , mint needs to be planted once you will have them for years.

And grow easy things like water crest and radishes easy and super fast to grow. Radishes leafs can me eaten and are delicious in soup. Bean sprouts are easy to make and super cheap. In just a week I think they are ready. Pls do not buy them in the seeds just get some dried beans (soy or otherwise)

Cherry tomatoes grow well in pots and yield a good amount of fruits.

want a cheap, fresh and nice cheese. buy ricotta, split in in several containers: you can keep as is, or add chives+ garlic powder+ parsley, add ground black and red peppercorn, add crushed walnuts , add shallots and onion powder, black pepper and cranberries. all with salt too. there you can have different flavours , like fancy cheese but for way less!

Look for apps or stores that sell refuced product due to expiration date. But buy the essentials not like premade salad and stuff. Note that stuff such as sugar , salt , coffee, tea , soda, sparkling water, water, do not expire even if they have expiration dates. That is the difference between best before and consume before. At lest after many years the coffee or tea might loose a bit of its aroma. That is all.

Look in the freezer section here a whole salmon from alaska is 4 to 7 euros it is less than what you spend on 2 slices if fresh salmon. Same some white fish are quite cheap.

Don‚Äôt waste food and watch your portions. Store your food properly. If it starts to be less fresh and you are not eating it, cut the veggies cook them and freeze them or just freeze them raw to use later . Same for fruits freeze them for smoothies, pastries or homemade icream.

Eat your leftovers during the next meal or take them at work or freeze them for the day you do not want to cook. Don't let them stay in your fridge too long then throw them.

Here is a way to keep your greens last a long time and keep being crisp and crunchy [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/vbdfsu/the_best_way_to_keep_your_salad_fresh_and_crispy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) so you can make the most if them. Less food waste, less money spent.

Take your food with you for work. Even if you feel lazy just grab 1/2 a baguette or some bread, a tomato , some cheese and a can of tuna. If not make something in advance potato salad with peas corn eggs... Bean and rice ....etc.

For the other things for the house:

Prefer soap bar rather than liquid. And if you feel like having fun or experimenting it is quite easy to make. Tried it it was fun. Oil +lye (can 't rember the other name) few drops of essential oils if you want it sented. Made some with olive oil and some with coconut oil that I did not use. Both were organic and for less than 8 bucks I had around 20. You can use non organic cheaper oils. Not saying it is cheaper you would have to check, also be careful and follow a recipe. In my case it was cheaper than the storebought but it was fir the fun part of the experiment.

Don't buy body scrubs keep your coffee grinds use under the shower. (1tsp per week/2weeks) Last edit on this topic. I will not adress this or reply to snarky comments and nitpicky people. I added it to stop the controversy. Some people pointed out that coffee is bad for the drainage system /sewers. So this is more like a disclaimer. Do what you wish with it. Things like cleaning products, products to unclog the toilets even some (if not a lot) are bad for that too. Coffee scrubs are sold commercially in australia and many european countries. Do with that information as you wish. This is a frugal post . You can also use the grinds as a ferilizer for your plants!

Don't buy limescale tablets for your washer /dishwasher just a squeeze of white vinegar from time to time is more effective than the tablets. Works for the shower head , your pipes in your kettle.

Buy concentrated bleach It is cheaper, has less packaging, and is easier to carry. Use it for your bathroom (to kill the mold,sanitize and leave the sink, toilet bowl and shower super white)and to clean your floors. Want it scented? Throw in orange and lime skins when you put it in a bottle back to normal scale (non concentrated version, don't keep it in the concentrated version we tend to use mych more than needed in that case)

Want odor neutralizer? A spray bottle don't buy one there are plenty if ways to get one that would go to waste+ water +vinegar . Want it fragrant? Same truck with the citrus skins or add few drops of essential oils!

Want fragrant air freshener ? Repurpose a small perfume, colone or even small fizzy drink bottle (as long as it has a narrow neck), put rubbing alcohol add a few drops of esential oils and put 4 or 5 wooden skewers!

Cloged drain? White vinegar let it sit then add bicarb soda. eventually boiling water.

Buy a brush for doing the dishes last longer and it super effective and instead if buying sponges make tawashis with old clothes. No more buying sponges all the time.

Keep your citus zests no need for vanilla extract.

Adding a few things that can be helpful around the house:

Neem oil is great to use against (repellent):

Against fleas /ticks on your cat and dog (diluted at 20 %I believe), it is suoer cheap compared to the things you buy in the shops. Against mosquitos (diluted too , chech for recipe. Also I addressed that on an other post.) Against some insect invasions on plants. Check it online. I did not have the occasion to use it like that but I know people who did) Against lice ((Bought a 9 ‚Ç¨bottle online , 6 /7years ago to use on 2 cats (flea repellent) all year round, making my mosquito sprays every summer , still have 1/4 of the 500ml bottle left!

Against ants that might invade your house like it did mine (hence I thought of adding this). Cheaper than other chemical repellent by far.

Buy chalk or diatomaceous earth. Sprinkle it where they enter your house, around it, or in the places they come to eat stuff. (For so e reason I think this will spark controversy) It makes them feel desoriented if they are already in that place , they will leave after a while)

diatomaceous earth is also used for oeople who have chicken or bunnies to be put in their cage ir where they sleep to avoid flea infestations too.

Cloves are natural moth repellent you can put in a mousseline bag in your kitchen cabinets as well as your cupboard.

One easy good snack shrimp chips, the ones you cook yourself . You can buy then in Asian stores. They are quite cheap. You can fry them or a heatgier method pop them in the microwave on a plate (no overlap it would burn so pread them allowing them to expand). For 4 bucks I get 1 kg and they last forever.

keep your old tshirts /clothes and instead of throwing them you can make tawashis to clean with, and use some as rags to mop. maybe even to use as towel instead of paper

mesh from fruits and veggies can be rolled into balls and used to clean the dishes

keep your apple seeds to make jam or jelly instead of buying pectin or sugar with pectin in it.

keep and dry seeds form what you buy to plant them: I use pumkin seeds because they grow well and gives a lot of fruits, tomatoes and chillies. also have two loquat trees grown from seeds. I know some people will scream at this but it is true and it works

some leaves are eatable and delicious . Do not throw them: radish leaves make awsome soup; beet leaves sauted like spinach are even better than spinach imo and I love spinach, some people make pesto from carrot leaves ( never tried it myself); grapes leaves can be stuffed ... there are few others too. [link for leaves usage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/11licuw/dont_leave_your_leaves_behind/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

you have or can get stale bread use it : [recipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/w6xjwa/stale_bread_no_waste_cheap_recipes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

check: waste fighting apps/site like toogoodtogo, geev, freecycle etc

A last thing :

if you have an organic shop nearby always check (especially if they have a refill section) some stuff is cheaper in there. In general flaxseed, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and depending on where you are red lentils, buckwheat, millet and other grains... Sometimes even fresh fruits. In mine oranges and apples are often cheaper (maybe 1/2 the time). avocados are cheaper all the time!

1. Also I would like to point out for food, store brands usually come out of the same factories as name brands... So no it is not necessarily better because you pay more. sometimes you pay more than 3 times the same orange juice , pasta etc for no reason. also it is proven that jice from concentrate is the same as the other one. people can't even tell the difference.

This is valid for other stuff too like soaps and other things. So save your bucks instead of enriching mainly shareholders(yes it doesn't go to the workers or in the ingredients)

Check your ethnic shops (Asian,mexican, middle Eastern, African...) they often sell legumes, rice, spices, flours and different grains for cheaper than your supermarket , sometimes meat , fish and veggies too.",2,1750860012.0,Thrifty,1,1.0,False

Since the last dev diary, I‚Äôve been juggling a few things‚Äîsome small, some pretty big.

# ‚òï Side Project: Endless Coffee Shots

First off, I dusted off an old side project I started way back in 2015‚Äîa tiny app for tracking your caffeine intake called¬†[**Endless Coffee Shots**](https://apps.apple.com/app/coffee-shots/id969576963). I gave it a full makeover, rewrote it from scratch, and added some fresh features.

# üõ†Ô∏è Minor Updates for Endless TV Tycoon

Next, I shipped 3 hotfix updates to take care of bugs and little annoyances that players reported. Thanks for every message‚Äîyou help make the game better!

Here‚Äôs what got fixed:

* Crash when¬†**sending email**¬†and¬†**bug reports**.
* Crash when¬†**saving tutorial settings**.
* **Scheduling issues**¬†when releasing episodes for two seasons at the same time, especially if you moved the show to a new network mid-airing.
* A¬†**phantom studio**¬†appeared in the Studio Ranking list even if you hadn‚Äôt launched one yet. It‚Äôs gone now.
* On the Networks screen, player-owned networks showed ""No Intel"" for¬†**Yearly Viewership**¬†and Average Episode Budget. Viewership now works, and the budget label has been renamed to¬†**Target Episode Budget**¬†to better reflect what it is: how much your network is willing to pay on average. For player networks, it now says ""Your Call.""
* Also on the Networks screen,¬†**pitching chance**¬†showed up for player-owned networks when opened from the Management Office where it didn‚Äôt belong.
* **End Week performance**: sometimes old schedules didn‚Äôt get cleaned up properly, which made things slow. It might still lag for the first week or two after the update, but it should speed up a lot afterward.

If you haven‚Äôt updated yet‚Äî[**grab the latest version**](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1505768107)¬†to get all the tweaks and fixes! üëå

# üß≠ So‚Ä¶ What Now?

I‚Äôm truly grateful for everyone who discovered and supports Endless TV Tycoon. ü•∞ But the truth is: while we‚Äôve built a small and passionate community, growth has stalled. And without more players, it‚Äôs impossible to reach the point where development finally becomes sustainable.

One idea I tried recently was the Game Pass Raffle‚Äîa way to reward daily play and encourage players to invite friends and spread the word. The idea was simple, but it didn‚Äôt work. Very few people joined in, no one invited others or spread the word, and I didn‚Äôt hear back from anyone about the feature even after asking for feedback.

Looking back, I think the whole idea was flawed. So, I‚Äôm pulling the plug.¬†**Game Pass Raffle will end with a final draw in early July**¬†(for the June tickets). Winners will get their Ultimate Passes as promised. After that, it‚Äôs done.

# üß† Rethinking the Game‚Äôs Future

I‚Äôm shifting gears, and am brainstorming some bigger changes aimed at making the game:

* more fun and intuitive for¬†**first-time players**,
* more engaging for¬†**longtime fans**,
* and full of those cool,¬†**shareable moments**¬†that make you want to talk about the game with friends.

These ideas are still very early, but I‚Äôll be fleshing them out over the next few weeks. My plan is to roll out improvements¬†**gradually**¬†through minor updates‚Äînot in one major update.

And once I see signs of growth again, I‚Äôll get back to working on the next major update, which will include the fan-voted¬†**Critics & Viewer Reviews**system.

Thanks for sticking around‚ÄîI really hope I can keep making Endless TV Tycoon better and better for years to come. üí™ As always, feel free to message me with ideas or suggestions. I read everything. ü§ó

I (M20s) am a part-time city councilman in a city of about 15,000 people. I have worked hard to stand out as a problem solver and community advocate, and I believe I have a small but supportive base of supporters that live in the city. I deeply care about my community and especially those who are facing very tough times. I also work hard to prioritize the middle class who are in the tough spot of making too much money to qualify for assistance, but too little to cover all their bills.

I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôve been doing a very good job representing our community, but I really want to keep up, improve my legislative skills, and really stand out as a young leader in my community, and possibly even on social media. I hope you read through some of what I‚Äôve been working on and perhaps even answer the questions below.

So far, I‚Äôve taken these actions:

* Irregularly hold coffee hours, usually on a specific topic
* Hold large town halls on controversial topics
* Show up to events
* Try to be proactive on social media and answer people‚Äôs questions about the city
* Host small events with local organizations
* Advocate for local issues, and state and federal issues by writing letters on behalf of residents to decision-makers at those levels
* Write resolutions or ordinances that solve local issues

I think I could be doing more. I‚Äôve got some ideas, but I‚Äôm not sure how effective they will be:

* I am considering a door-knocking campaign to speak to people about their specific concerns
* Starting up a monthly newsletter
* Running targeted social media ads
* Helping to set up neighborhood watch groups around the city
* Hosting a yearly community barbecue
* Writing an op-ed in the newspaper

My main goal is to really help people in our community understand that we can only fix our city's problems by investing ourselves in a solution. I also see myself as a person working within a very frustrating system‚Äîfor residents and for me‚Äîbut always fighting for us.

I‚Äôm interested in possibly running for higher office in the future and would like to be prepared to run should the opportunity arise. However, my main goal is to advocate as best I can at the city level, build community, and raise people‚Äôs voices.

If you read this far, I‚Äôll provide a summary of what I am interested in hearing about:

* What events can I do that will be more effective and will draw in less engaged residents?
* Other than the local issues that I am well-versed in, what local issues or initiatives are picking up steam around the country that I can research for implementation in our community?
* How can I use my platform to bring more people together in our community and on social media?",6,1750859525.0,PoliticalOptimism,0,1.0,False

The top choice, at least for me, is cocuy, which is a Venezuelan autochthonous agave species and the spirit made from it can be very rustic in many cases. If you look up on Google, you will most likely get directed towards a brand called Saroche. Be advised it is not cocuy. Its process is more akin to tequila, but true cocuy is smoky and strong and delicious. 

I tried a basic one yesterday, bottled at 40% ABV but still very flavorful. Paired with a Dominican Montecristo Afrique, with a Cameroon wrapper and leaves from Ecuador, Peru, Nicaragua and Tanzania, it was a relatively mild to medium smoke with flavors of coffee, oak, nuts and spice (not really spicy *per se*).",2,1750859371.0,tequila,0,1.0,False

1lk65vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/1lk65vh/pros_and_cons_of_google_operations_center/,Pros and Cons of Google Operations Center Philippines (Scandal from L1S perspective),"Please be advised externally: **Sharing internal screenshots with external parties is prohibited to protect proprietary information. HAHAHA**

Google Operations Center Philippines (GOC) partners with Google to help bring their incredible products and services to life. Our solutions are rooted in technical skill, product expertise, and a deep understanding of customers‚Äô complex needs.

* Most of them are absorbed from Cognizant.

Company Values of Google Operations Center (GOC)

1. **Better Together**
2. **Meaningful Connections**
3. **Work hard, play hard**
4. **Save the day, every day.**
5. **Improve continuously.**
6. **Respect the responsibility.**

I have been with GOC Philippines since dinosaur period, and you won't believe what kind of experience you'll get inside that company. L1S are mostly called internally as Digital Media Advisor or externally as Customer Support.

**Pros:**

* Duration: Only good for 1 - 4 months
* Pantry: Free Breakfast, Lunch, Meryenda, Dinner
* Micro Pantry: Unlimited Snacks such as Milk, Coffee, Tea, Milk Tea, Chocolate, Chips, Biscuit, Dried fruits, Nuts and more.
* Equipment Provided: Laptop, Monitor and Accessories
* Onboarding: It is good very accommodating; will help you boarded right to your designated pod.

**Cons:**

* Training:
   * Training Delivery not that serious most of the time you were forced to slack and eat.
   * Process is not detailed nor discussed during training time. You'll hear most of them on huddle time and you will be technically clueless of what is happening.
   * In training you will also be warned silently that tenure will not treat you well or will not help you during the process.
   * Knowledge Base/Internal/External Article: Most of them are outdated, hidden and gatekept by tenure.

Task schedule injustice; Example: Start date of the task is March 4 and deadline is March 7. Mostly they will talk to you 1 hour before end of shift Match 5 then it will be handed over to you on March 6, which is 1 day before the bloody deadline.

Let's rate them atleast 2.5/10.

* Support Channels:
   * Phone: This is the easiest path mostly you'll receive 1-3 calls per day, and you are going to need full product knowledge to give quality support.
   * Chat: This is the intermediate path where you might receive 3-10 chats per day and require full product knowledge to help clients accordingly.
   * Email: This is the newbie path where you get to learn and explore things from your own pod.

The process here is mixed either that was assigned by Hive a.k.a Workforce or your own pod Queue Managers which are some of your tenure agents that take cases. Hive will assign any cases they want to assign, and Queue Managers will assign cases depending on its own difficulty. Remember: Queue Managers are bias they keep the easiest case for them to increase their own productivity.

Let's rate them atleast 6/10.

* Client Workflow Process:
   * L1G/TechSol (@google.com):
      * L1G agent are mostly from BPO their training is substandard and most of them are providing incomplete troubleshooting process mostly they escalate with L1S consult to get more insights. However, during the process L1S will just push them back due to their invalid consult because most of them won't do any troubleshooting at all, while some do little troubleshooting and L1S new hires are eager to help them, but new hires are advised to push them back and educate them event at the cost of Total Resolution Time for the client.
      * TechSol agent are originally from Google Operations Center itself they are like L1G but most of them had complete generalized training to help external client resolve issues in agile method usually with Google Meet. Whenever they are raising a consult L1S advised them to follow best practices and they're rarely getting pushback on the process.
   * Account Manager (@google.com): They are the internal client or advertiser who works with Google they are well versed with the product and mostly would raise a ticket with either L1G, TechSol or L1S based on the program if they are from Bronze to Platinum.
   * External Client (@intheirowndomain.com): These are clients who uses different domain most of them are categorize from Bronze to Platinum (Never heard of Diamond). External Clients are the people who bring money or doom to GOC. Whenever they raise a ticket based on the program if they are from Bronze to Platinum they might encounter L1G, TechSol or L1S.

Based on L1S perspective. L1G agents are the most mistreated among the consult process. TechSol agents are slightly professionally advised. Account Manager and External Client were the milking cows treated like Kings and Queens during the process. What's worst here is when they had scattered implicit and explicit question that it is required to be addressed word by word or sentence by sentence.

Let's rate them atleast 8/10.

* Support Process:
   * pSME here is not the same as the pSME you had in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) which they standby and help you. The pSME here in GOC Philippines would mostly require you to submit form before they assist you, you'll see them slacking, scrolling and playing mobile games most of the time. They are generous in chat or phone process but mostly when you ask, they won't help you directly and might even gaslight you in the email process.

Let's rate them atleast 2/10.

* Quality Assurance Process:
   * Most of them are friendly they will help you regarding the whole delivery process even in troubleshooting so you can finish early and won't get subjected into a torture process especially if you're a new hire. The process is easy with QA when you ask them but tenure agents and pSME will gatekeep you from reaching out to them by assigning you an L1G or TechSol case. You'll get the real score card with QA and the hard part with QA is that the process takes 15mins to 4hrs depending on their queue and you had to wait, worst is overtime before sending your email. This will highlight the value from the which is **""Improve continuously""**.

Let's rate them atleast 8.5/10.

* Nesting: Nesting part has stage 1 and stage 2. Stage 1 is a weighted quality where tenure agents have a power to evaluate your delivery performance. Stage 2 is the part where pSME will evaluate all of your troubleshooting process. Good luck with this process as said before people on production area won't be so friendly especially if you're a new hire and mostly you'll get gaslighted, mistreated or even subjected to overtime due to superiority complex and power abuse. Think of it as if you're joining masonry or fraternity, while it has mental initiation or task hazing and this will highlight one of their values **""Better Together""**, **""Work hard, play hard""** because you will either ask or will be asked with your tenured buddies. Being in this process is not about how smart you are, how great you are or how well experienced you are, it's how they are pleased.

Let's rate the nesting atleast -4/10.

* New Hire Process: After the nesting duration, you will be subjected to stage 2 and might as well receive a regularization letter, in this process you will understand the meaning of this value ""**Save the day, every day""**. Conditionally after you receive a regularization letter within 6 months, they have a power to retract the regularization contract if your stage 1 result is questionable by sending you another extended training agreement to restart your stage 1. There people will not help you unless you're favored and mostly you are doomed with the process. Imagine you're already more than 6 months in the company and your employment is under threat of termination within 1 month. So, knock-knock department of labor and employment.

Let's rate the new hire process -5/10.

* Tenure: Tenure agents where most likely more than 1 year in the company and if you're a new hire they might be your torture buddies, helping buddies? or NSFW buddies. In short think of them as spawn of the very great Satan. They're here not to make your life easy in GOC, if you get their favor, they might help you but mostly they will torture you and gaslight you within your journey in the company. If you're already in the company as new hire you might be wondering and feel like you're being gatekeep? being under unreasonable overtime? Tenure, pSME and queue managers are the 99.9% culprit.

Let's rate them atleast -9/10.

* Culture: GOC culture is fun you will understand the meaning of this value ""**Meaningful Connections**"". They have a lot of external activities, but do not expect if they had especial designated time for team building. Team buildings do really happen at your very rest day. Special occasions mostly happened on weekends. They are very much LGBT friendly you'll see a lot of drag queens over there. Overtime? it is allowed 3hrs a day so if you get overtime for atleast 7-9hrs and passionately wants to resolve all of your cases it's a bye-bye OTY, you'll know it is the Tenured, pSME and queue managers are the 99.9% culprit of this scheme. Benefits? GOC is much better with benefits and retirement also with medical assistance, it is for you to discover these wonderful things.

Let's rate them atleast 6.5/10.

* Workmates: Once you get tenured issues are still there and you are advised to make the life new hire's doomed to hell even if you don't want to and if you're kindhearted you will always find a way to help a person even if that betrays you and this ""**Respect the responsibility""** value will attest a challenge to keep things secret. You might as well think of new job opportunities or get apply for internal job postings. The quality of life there has an expectancy of 1 - 2 years then mostly you go to another pod or resign.

Let's rate them atleast 4.5/10

* Gossip: Gossip is the worst part of the scenario either you get betrayed, gets highlighted as great example for flattery and deceit. Well, it is true that there are lots of NSFW there, but it happens outside the office. There you'll hear stories from another pod a cheating issue where a new hire girl breaks up with his filipino fiancee from US and deny marriage proposal then the next three weeks you'll hear stories about her doing some other night in her apartment with a long-time tenure drunk while his girlfriend ringing his phone. Another thing is a gay who run away with his laptop and did not send it back exhausting all the leaves until leaving without prior notice and you'll never hear from him. Next is group of new hire with high attrition rate thinking about everyday resignation and gossiping about when will they resign due to hardcore nesting process. Lastly is that you might encounter one of your former friends that you become a true friend helped a lot then the next day they will put you down after getting some attention with another people.

Let's rate them atleast 3.5/10

Now count the overall rating : )

If you have any questions or clarifications, please feel free to ask! Other redditors and gossipers are here to help!

The man had been walking for days.

His name was Reuben, and he had once been a middle manager in a mid-tier packaging corporation. But packaging never quite packaged the answers he‚Äôd been looking for. One day, over his third cup of gas station coffee and his twelfth podcast on ‚Äúmindful abundance,‚Äù he heard an episode whisper of a master‚Äîan old man who lived atop the world‚Äôs highest mountain, a sage with wrinkles deep enough to hold rainwater and a reputation older than most countries. Reuben made a decision: he would go.

With the determination of a soul who had just unsubscribed from every streaming service for ‚Äúspiritual clarity,‚Äù Reuben began his journey.

In the *Great Jungle*, lush and whispering with leaves and unspoken promises, Reuben met his first peril.

He was nearly eaten‚Äînot by tigers, not by venomous snakes, not even by the time-bending bureaucracy of the local border patrol‚Äîbut by a gang of rebel squirrels. These were not your average nut hoarders. These were insurgent rodents trained in guerrilla tactics, descendants of the original jungle resistance that once fought the monkeys for canopy dominance.

They came for his trail mix.

But Reuben had once worked in HR mediation, and with slow, deep breathing and firm eye contact, he negotiated safe passage in exchange for three packets of honey-roasted almonds and a spare pair of socks, which the squirrels took as a sign of weakness in the human foot arch design. He moved on, slightly traumatized and vaguely itchy.

The *Great and Empty Desert* came next.

It was vast and uninviting, the kind of place where even mirages got bored and wandered off. Here, Reuben's trial was not thirst nor sandstorms, but capitalism. A caravan of robed desert hustlers offered spiritual enlightenment in exchange for ‚Äújust a swipe.‚Äù Reuben, weary and open-minded, agreed to one ‚Äúvibration alignment scan,‚Äù which somehow almost resulted in his credit card being enrolled in a loyalty program for camel shampoo.

He escaped, wallet intact but dignity slightly scorched. The desert stretched behind him like a long silence, and ahead rose the hazy mirage of the *Great Mountain*.

The mountain loomed like a deity‚Äîancient, unspeaking, indifferent.

Reuben approached its base with reverence, compacted gear strapped to his back: food bars that tasted like regret, oxygen packets that hissed like angry chipmunks when opened, and water so distilled it apologized for existing. He had thought ahead and brought a single roll of high-grade toilet paper, double ply, blessed by a yoga instructor in Boulder.

He climbed.

Days passed. The incline grew cruel. The altitude stole his breath and hoarded it like a dragon. Occasionally, he would squat behind a rock and ponder the importance of humility and fiber. Still, he did not complain. He knew this journey was not meant to be comfortable. The path to knowledge was never paved, let alone with restrooms.

At last, shivering and sweating in equal parts, he reached the summit.

There stood the **Ancient Stone Building**, older than ambition, carved by monks with a deep disdain for level floors. He pushed open the heavy wooden doors and entered.

There sat the *Master*, cloaked in layers of woven silence. The room smelled of incense, sandalwood, and lightly microwaved broccoli.

Reuben bowed, though his knees objected. ""I wish to know the meaning of life.""

The old man didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt blink. A long pause. Then:

""You must first offer your food, water, and toilet paper to the *God of Need*.""

Reuben hesitated. Was this a metaphor? A test?

But no, the old man was holding out a shopping basket.

Reuben handed over his carefully rationed supplies, watching as the sage inspected each item like a grandmother judging the fruit at a farmer‚Äôs market.

""Carbonated water?"" the master finally muttered, lifting a can and frowning. ""Seriously? What are you folks going to bring next? Scented kombucha?""

Reuben said nothing.

The master sighed, tucked the roll of toilet paper under one arm, and stood with a creak that sounded like the mountain itself stretching. ‚ÄúVery well. Come. I will take you to the *Porch of All Knowledge*.‚Äù

They stepped through a hidden door and emerged onto the most unexpected thing Reuben had seen on his journey.

A porch.

But not just any porch‚Äîthis was a wraparound, old-world porch, with polished wood railings, wind chimes made of dragon bones (or possibly wind chimes from Etsy‚Äîit was hard to say), and flowers blooming with impossible colors. A soft breeze carried the smell of jasmine, curry, and existential clarity.

""Wow,"" Reuben whispered. ""It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ beautiful.""

""Yes,"" the old man said, sipping from a cup that hadn‚Äôt been there moments before. ""This is where all questions are answered.""

Reuben stepped forward. He felt it. The gravity of truth. The pulse of the universe. The hand of God Himself brushing against his‚Äî

The plank snapped.

Reuben, eyes wide, mouth forming a question he would never ask, tumbled.

He fell past clouds. Past dreams. Past the mountaintop wisdom and squirrel trauma. Past his own carefully narrated inner monologue.

His face was the first thing to make contact with the bottom of the mountain.

The old man watched the scene with a sigh. He turned and walked slowly back inside.

‚ÄúWhy do they always step there?‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúEvery single one‚Ä¶‚Äù

He sat down again, the warm cup in his hand steaming gently. His mind drifted‚Äînot to the cosmos, not to enlightenment‚Äîbut to lunch.

*A hamburger would be nice. Greasy, maybe with onion rings.*

And perhaps, just perhaps, he thought, it was time to install more outhouses. Enlightenment was one thing, but fiber wasn't what it used to be.

From somewhere in the jungle below, a faint squirrel war chant could be heard.

I‚Äôd worked here on and off before, but never really got to know the area well or many people outside of work. Since moving, life‚Äôs been a bit intense juggling a demanding job, kids, and caregiving for a parent long distance amongst other things, so I haven‚Äôt had much time to meet people or explore.

Now that things have settled down a bit, I‚Äôm hoping to connect with some like minded folks and build a sense of community here.

I‚Äôm a 46 yr old m. tattooed, vegan (don‚Äôt care if you are), and have spent most of my life working in the music industry playing in bands, studio work, touring, etc. Raised on punk, hardcore, and love more obscure sounds, but my taste is all over the map. Always down to talk records, gear, or swap playlists. I‚Äôve got tickets to Unwound at the Church in September if that‚Äôs a window for anyone. Would be great to meet folks who go to shows in Philly or NYC.

Outside of music, I‚Äôm into art, antiques, photography, specialty coffee, cooking (recently started baking bread as well), and just getting into hiking and biking. Trying to spend more time outdoors. 

I‚Äôm in a relationship with someone based in Central Jersey, so I feel like most of my social time/meeting new people happens when I‚Äôm there with her and not so much at home. Would be cool to meet couples to hang with here too. I‚Äôve checked out a few local meetups, but most seem pretty sports centric, which isn‚Äôt really exactly my scene.

If you‚Äôre into similar ish stuff (or even if not so much) and open to meeting up whether for a show, a coffee, or just stress free convo feel free to shoot me a message.

There you'll hear stories from another pod a cheating issue where a new hire girl breaks up with his filipino fiancee from US and deny marriage proposal then the next three weeks you'll hear stories about her doing some other night in her apartment with a long-time tenure drunk while his girlfriend ringing his phone. Another thing is a gay who run away with his laptop and did not send it back exhausting all the leaves until leaving without prior notice and you'll never hear from him. Next is group of new hire with high attrition rate thinking about everyday resignation and gossiping about when will they resign due to hardcore nesting process. Lastly is that you might encounter one of your former friends that you become a true friend helped a lot then the next day they will put you down after getting some attention with another people.

Let's rate them atleast 3.5/10

Now count the overall rating : )

Eventually, she stopped picking me up from school if it interfered with his plans. I spent a lot of nights at my aunt‚Äôs house just to avoid being home.

By the time I was 15, I moved in with my dad full-time. My mom barely called or checked in. She married the guy a year later. I wasn‚Äôt invited to the wedding. I didn‚Äôt even know it happened until a cousin mentioned it. I stopped trying after that. We went years without speaking, until recently when she reached out saying she wants to rebuild things.

We met for coffee, and she started talking like we were just going to pick up where we left off. I told her I can be polite, but I don‚Äôt forgive her. I said she made her choice back then and it wasn‚Äôt me. She started crying and said I was being unfair. She said she was trying her best. I said maybe, but your best hurt me.

I‚Äôm a freelance business consultant. My time is mine. My focus is intentional. If I give you either, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve already read something in you worth exploring. And if we talk, it won‚Äôt be surface-level. I don‚Äôt do surface.

I don‚Äôt chase. I pull. I don‚Äôt flirt for fun‚ÄîI flirt to provoke, to disarm, to get under your skin in the most unforgettable ways. Words, when used right, aren‚Äôt just communication‚Äîthey‚Äôre foreplay.

I write erotic poetry. Not because I need a reaction‚Äîbut because truth hits harder when it‚Äôs wrapped in restraint. The right line, whispered low, should make you shiver. Not because it‚Äôs dirty‚Äîbecause it knows you.

I cook, yes‚Äîbut not like a man trying to impress. Like a man who takes his time. Who knows the rhythm of seduction starts before the first touch.

I had gained 30 pounds in 2 years, I was eating fast food every single day and it was impossible to avoid the food noise. I was at my lowest point but my highest weight essentially

I decided I needed to take control of my life again, since I was able to quit vaping in January, I would now challenge my eating habits. I still had food noise, and craved Taco Bell or Mcdonald‚Äôs all the time, but being in a calorie deficit really helped me not give in, otherwise it would‚Äôve put me far over my limit for the day 

I ended up discovering some of my favorite foods because of clean eating, that I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve ever tried otherwise. Spaghetti squash, sweet potato, all different types of berries, spinach, TUNA!!!, etc

When I wake up every morning, I don‚Äôt feel groggy and defeated. Many days I wake up on my own quite early and refreshed. I don‚Äôt crave a Dunkin breakfast sandwich and 500 calorie coffee, just something whole and nutritious that brings me much more comfort than a greasy egg and cheese crossaint. 

My menstrual cycle has completely changed. I‚Äôm currently on my cycle and I remember for my whole life, ever since I first started getting it I had terrible cramps, the type that make you nauseous, and you can‚Äôt even move for the first 3 days. Ever since I started focusing on primarily whole foods, I have zero cramps, I didn‚Äôt even have to take medication. On my second day (usually the heaviest) I had light cramps that went away after a short walk. 

My skin has never looked better! I used to spend so much money on skincare, masks, exfoliators, etc so my skin could keep up with my diet but these days I just use moisturizer and sunscreen (I wear makeup everyday) and my skin looks very clear! This is also attributed to the fact that I drink water more water than I used to ( about 68 fl oz a day) when back then I used to drink maybe one water bottle.

I still enjoy Taco Bell every now and then when I‚Äôm with my friends, and when I have it I am satisfied. I don‚Äôt crave it again and again and again. I just let myself have the treat and it always fits into my calories for the day if you order the low cal stuff :) 

I highly recommend prioritizing whole foods it really is the best way to bulk up on food and volume eat, to ensure satiety but also so you‚Äôre not lacking in any nutrients, which whole veggies and fruits provide so much ofüíï",0,1750858764.0,1200isplenty,4,0.48,False

It was the middle of summer.

Inside the Shepard Villa, a young woman sat on an expensive leather sofa, lazily enjoying her bubblegum. Her flawless skin seemed to glisten under the sunlight.

She was as beautiful as a work of art.

She puffed and blew a bubble even larger than her face.

‚ÄúBonnie‚Äôs just not good enough for me, okay? I‚Äôm canceling the wedding!‚Äù

The man standing in the doorway threw the young woman a disgusted look.

Bonnie‚Äôs mother, Vera Shepard, was alarmed.

‚ÄúHadwin, I know I can‚Äôt really blame you for this because Bonnie is always fooling around.

‚ÄúBut her grandpa and your grandpa wanted you to marry her. How could you cancel the wedding just like that?‚Äù

Vera shot Bonnie a glare.

‚ÄúApologize to Hadwin now, and promise that you‚Äôll never fool around again!‚Äù

Bonnie popped her bubblegum and looked up defiantly.

‚ÄúApologize? He should be the one apologizing to me! He broke his promise to marry me and insulted

me!‚Äù

Vera was infuriated.

Before she could say a word, Bonnie continued, ‚ÄúBesides, I‚Äôve never fooled around, okay? He‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs been cheating on me! So I don‚Äôt care if the wedding is canceled anyway.‚ÄúBonnie! Why, you‚Äî‚Äù

Vera spoke through clenched teeth.

‚ÄúEnough, Vera.‚Äù

Holding up his hand, Hadwin interrupted and said, ‚ÄúBonnie‚Äôs beauty is only skin deep. I appreciate inner beauty more.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never marry someone like her, even if she begs me to. There‚Äôs only one girl I‚Äôll ever marry-

He looked upstairs lovingly.

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs Trina.‚Äù

‚ÄúHadwin!‚Äù Moved, Trina Shepard rushed downstairs.

‚ÄúTrina!‚Äù Hadwin strode over to the stairwell and opened his arms.

Trina threw herself into his embrace.

Tears welled up in Trina‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúI can finally marry you now!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Trina, I should have canceled the wedding sooner.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right. I know you had your reasons‚Ä¶‚Äù

As the couple made eyes at each other, Bonnie received a text:

‚ÄúMs. Bonita, the research is at its final stage. Elite soldiers have been sent to escort you for your safety. We‚Äôre arriving now.‚Äù

Bonnie wrote a reply: ‚ÄúBe right out.‚Äù

She spat out her bubblegum, got up, and headed toward the door. Trina, who was secretly watching her, thought Bonnie was leaving because she felt ashamed.

But she didn‚Äôt think Bonnie had been humiliated enough.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go, Bonnie! I‚Äôm sorry for what happened. Hadwin and I love each other. You can just blame me for this, okay? It‚Äôs not his fault.‚Äù

Bonnie calmly looked over her shoulder.

‚ÄúFuck off, bitch,‚Äù Bonnie said impassively.

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you forgive me? Why don‚Äôt you hit me so you can feel better?‚Äù

Trina took Bonnie‚Äôs hand and used it to slap her own face.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing, Bonnie? How dare you assault your sister!‚Äù

Vera charged over and smacked Bonnie‚Äôs hand away.

Bonnie looked down and saw the red mark on her hand.

After a few seconds, she gazed up at Vera.

Vera was her biological mother, but she had always been partial to Trina, who was adopted.

A teary‚Äìeyed Trina started to choke up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not her fault, mom. It‚Äôs all on me. I shouldn‚Äôt have stolen her fianc√©. I-‚Äù

Before she could finish, Bonnie interrupted.

‚ÄúWhy would I blame you? You‚Äôre a born slut. You can‚Äôt help yourself, can you?‚Äù

Trina was infuriated, but she couldn‚Äôt ruin her nice girl image.

‚ÄúTrina‚Äôs your younger sister, Bonnie! How could you say such a thing?‚ÄùVera looked at Bonnie in disappointment.

Bonnie, however, was impassive. noveldrama

‚ÄúShe is not my sister.‚Äù

20 years ago, Bonnie and Trina were accidentally switched at birth by a nurse.

It wasn‚Äôt until five years ago that the truth came to light, and she was brought back to the Shepard family from the countryside.

Vera continued to raise Trina as she didn‚Äôt want her to live in poverty.

Instead of making it up to Bonnie, Vera became biased against her due to her rural upbringing.

‚ÄúHow could you say something so hurtful? I might not have given birth to her, but she‚Äôs still my daughter. Don‚Äôt ever say that again!‚Äù

Vera often wished that she had given birth to Trina instead.

Bonnie had heard that many times.

‚ÄúI need to go. I‚Äôm not coming back tonight.‚Äù

Bonnie headed to the door.

‚ÄúWhat? You‚Äôre going out to fool around again?‚Äù Vera was angry.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that,‚Äù Bonnie replied.

‚ÄúThen what have you been doing? Spill it!‚Äù Vera shouted.

Bonnie pursed her lips with a frown. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs classified. I can‚Äôt tell you.‚Äù

She left the villa before Vera could say another word.

‚ÄúWhat did I do to deserve such a daughter?‚Äù

Outside, Bonnie reached the gate.

She saw more than a hundred green armored vehicles come roaring over.

Suddenly, a deafening ‚Äòwhoop‚Äìwhoop‚Äìwhoop‚Äò was heard, accompanied by gusts

Bonnie looked up and saw a dozen helicopters hovering in the sky, ready for action. of strong wind.

Soldiers dressed in matching camouflage uniforms swiftly descended from the vehicles and surrounded Bonnie in an orderly fashion.

# Chapter 2

Their leader saluted Bonnie. ""Please get in the car, Ms. Bonita.""

""Why did you bring so many people here?""

Bonnie scanned her surroundings, noting not only the large number of people but also the heavy weaponry they held.

""You're a national treasure of Arvandor, Ms. Bonita. We can‚Äôt let anything happen to you. I would have brought at least ten times more soldiers if you hadn‚Äôt said something.‚Äù

The man who said that was Brigham Hartley. He wore navy blue epaulets on his shoulders adorned with yellow trim.

He stood tall and had an imposing presence.

""Come on, I'm just going to the research institute. Besides, I can take care of myself, okay?"" Bonnie said nonchalantly.

""The whole world is waiting for the results of your research. If you succeed, it‚Äôll be a game-changer for human civilization. We‚Äôll do anything to ensure your safety and keep anyone else from finding out your true identity!"" Brigham said, excitedly. He was a huge fan of Bonnie.

Bonnie raised her brow and tried to change the subject.

""Oh, where's Jim?""

""He's gone overseas to join the International Fighting Championship. I'll be in charge of your safety for now.""

""Okay, let's go."" Bonnie got into the vehicle.

The Shepard family butler heard the commotion and went out to the gate to find out what was going on. He was shocked to see Bonnie being escorted away by soldiers in camouflage.

""Oh, no, ma'am! Ms. Bonnie‚Äôs been taken away by the police.""

""What on earth happened?"" Vera was astounded.

""I have no idea, ma'am! An army of police officers cornered her and took her away.""

Vera quickly rushed out of the villa, followed by Trina and Hadwin.

When they reached the gate, the helicopters were long gone, and Vera only saw the SUVs moving away.

""What the hell?"" Vera grew pale and held a hand to her heart.

""Has Bonnie broken the law?"" Trina asked.

So many people came to get her! What could she possibly have done?"" Hadwin frowned.

Murder?

Multiple homicides?

Or something even crazier?

They had no way of knowing for now.

\*\*\*

Two days later, a round of applause erupted in the top laboratory of the city of Pyralis.

""Woohoo! We've finally succeeded after working on the research for a whole year.""

""We owe it to Ms. Bonita. We couldn't have developed the new carbon nanomaterial so soon without her guidance!""

""That's right, she's the reason why we succeeded! We‚Äôll be able to make advancements in every industry in the country once this nanomaterial is widely adopted. This is great news for Arvandor!""

""We're going to wow the whole world!""

Thrilled, the highly respected and elderly professors cheered like children.

Bonnie, however, continued to drink her coffee calmly.

One of the elderly professors approached her.

""I‚Äôve just received a call from the National Research Institute, Ms. Bonita. They‚Äôd like to know when you‚Äôll be available to hold the press conference.""

""Well, that's up to them.""

The old professor asked tentatively, ‚ÄúDo you mind if I take care of it?‚Äù

""Go ahead,"" Bonnie said.

""Oh, and even the International Collaborative Research Organization has called to ask about this now that we've garnered nationwide attention. You need to come to the press conference, okay?""

He was worried because Bonnie was usually low-key and almost never showed up at events like this.

Bonnie hesitated for a moment and said, ""Okay.""

The professor whooped inwardly in relief. He really thought she would say no.

If she had, he would have been placed in a difficult position because the higher-ups would insist he make her go.

""I'll deal with it then.""

""Sure."" Bonnie waved him off and continued to drink her coffee.

Her phone vibrated.

The caller ID showed that it was Sigmund Knight.

Bonnie answered it, and the old man's excited voice came through.

""I heard your wedding‚Äôs been canceled, Bonnie. Congratulations!"" He laughed heartily.

She had expected him to say this, so Bonnie waited for him to finish.

""Now, according to our agreement, you would think about marrying my grandson if you were no longer engaged. It‚Äôs time to fulfill your promise.""

Bonnie raised her brow. ""Okay, but will your grandson agree to this? He's the hottest bachelor in Pyralis. He could have any girl he wants.""

""He has to. Oh, I asked him to pick you up at a supermarket near the research institute so he wouldn't find out your true identity. I've given him your number. He‚Äôll text you when he arrives.""

Her phone dinged as she received a message that read ""I'm here.""

Sigmund heard it and quickly said, ""My grandson must have texted you. Go meet him now.""

""Okay,"" Bonnie answered indifferently. She left the institute after bidding the professors goodbye.

As she stepped out of the building, she saw an eye-catching black Maybach.

""That looks familiar‚Ä¶""

Three years ago, she successfully treated the father of a rich tycoon from overseas.

She had been given a limited-edition Maybach as a gift‚Äîthere were only ten in the world.

I WFH only 2 days per week now and, on those days, I do have a walking pad and standing desk. My troubles are mostly with my in-office days 3x per week. 

The parking lot (where I pay for a monthly pass) is relatively close to the building. I seem to leave the office with ~2k to 3k steps and that does include short coffee trips (also in the building, so not far). I start work at 7 AM (so I leave around 6-6:30 and I‚Äôm up as early as 5:30 so an early morning walk is just not an option!!).

Yeah. That sounds horrible. 
Sorry in advance, English is not my first language. Details are changed for anonymity. Throwaway account for the same reason.

I 23F, have met my boyfriend Josh 26M, when I was in high school. We‚Äôre together for 5 years and we live together for 2. Few months ago I met Steve 40M. 
I‚Äôm really torn between staying with my boyfriend or leaving him for Steve or completely moving out alone. 
I love my boyfriend, but for all of the duration of our relationship I‚Äôve been the only romantic one. Always planned dates, wanted physical touch, bought small things, complimented him, took photos etc. For 5 years I‚Äôve been fulfilling that role in our relationship. The thought behind it was that Josh is really busy with his studies on university. He also works almost full time. Other thing is, my understanding was that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just the way he is‚Äù. But after all this time, I feel completely burned out by that. There‚Äôs almost no romantic feelings in me for him. I love him dearly, but more like a best friend he‚Äôs been for me. The problem is that I‚Äôm really freaking romantic. It‚Äôs like air to me almost. It gives me so much joy and energy I couldn‚Äôt describe it to you all. I had so much of it, that I could just empty myself for Josh for those years. But now the barrel is empty. 
I talked to him about it recently. He‚Äôs really really apologetic. I‚Äôve never seen him so crushed till this - when he realised that I was so hurt by him. Josh told me that he would change, but doesn‚Äôt know when or how much. He finishes his bachelors degree in 4 months. The only thing that will be on his schedule will be me and full time work half remotely. I don‚Äôt know if I have any more patience. I‚Äôm really angry that he realised all this just now. And I‚Äôm angry with myself for not realising all this sooner. I‚Äôm scared that he won‚Äôt change much.

The trigger to all this is Steve. He‚Äôs my co-worker which I know for 5 months now. At the beginning of our relationship I really wanted him to be my friend. He‚Äôs really funny, has a lot of the same hobbies and interests as me. I didn‚Äôt have such a vibe with anybody for a really long time. We began talking through WhatsApp and then started to meet after work. Because Josh is always busy I had a lot of time for Steve, so we met a lot. For coffee, drinks, walks etc. 
After sometime he told me that he‚Äôs in love with me. I reluctantly said that we could only be friends which he accepted. But that sparked something in me. I started to think about it more intensely and suddenly I realised that I‚Äôm also in love. Tried to push it down but couldn‚Äôt. 

Josh knows that Steve‚Äôs in love with me, but he doesn‚Äôt mind because he‚Äôs sure that I wouldn‚Äôt choose him. Yeah. 
Steve‚Äôs giving me all the things that I‚Äôve been missing with Josh. I‚Äôm scared that I know Steve too little and he might just be using me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 
I feel completely lost. I don‚Äôt feel the strength to do basically anything at this point. I even considered moving out alone and not being in a relationship for a while because of this shit show that I have caused here. I feel in love with Steve, but I love Josh. Brain tells me to stay with my boyfriend, but heart aches for a co-worker.


Would I be the Asshole if I left Josh for Steve?

1lk5sp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_partners/comments/1lk5sp6/depressed_boyfriend_isolates_and_refuses_to_talk/,Depressed boyfriend isolates and refuses to talk about relationship since months,"I (M,29) have been with my boyfriend (M, 32) for three years.

We were in an LDR for two years before I moved to the same city last year (for my studies, job opportunities, and him). The first 4 months were in the same city, then 7 months apart on different continents, followed by a year living 3 hours apart. For the past year, we‚Äôve been just 15 minutes away. Normally, we saw each other twice a week‚Ä¶ often without spending the whole day together but we talk and exchange a lot, know each others families well and are very tender towards each other.

Since moving here, finding a rhythm that works for both of us has been tough. Lately, I‚Äôve been trying to give him space‚Äîhe struggles with mental health and a stressful student life. I‚Äôm sure he loves me and wants to be with me, and vice versa.

I‚Äôve known about his depression (linked to childhood trauma) since early adulthood, and we‚Äôve always talked openly about it, including my own struggles. He‚Äôs been through therapy and recently applied for a new program.

Lately, it‚Äôs been clear he‚Äôs not doing well‚Äîhe‚Äôs expressed it himself, even mentioning suicidal thoughts. Two months ago (after not spending a weekend together since February!), he admitted feeling completely overwhelmed, deeply depressed, and guilty for not meeting my needs. He started with *""Hey, we need to talk about our relationship‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt panic, it‚Äôs not a breakup.""* He said he felt less overwhelmed during our LDR, that last year was ""too close"" for him, and he needed distance.He also explained himself and his depressive state which i was thankfull for. He suggested seeing each other once a week, then every other weekend‚Ä¶ indefinitely. I was shocked‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt process it then or the next day. He seemed stuck in his own spiraling thoughts.

Two weeks later, I gently asked if we could discuss his concerns regarding the relationship at some point. He got defensive, saying I was pressuring him. I wrote him a letter (per his request) sharing my feelings, but he still hasn‚Äôt read it.

It‚Äôs been 1.5 months now‚Äîwe‚Äôve met 4 times, only twice overnight. When we text or talk (nearly daily texting) we completely avoid the relationship topics, exchange about other challenges and interests in our lifes though (im going through jobloss and being broke as never before). He told me hes going a bit better (that we found him a permanent place to stay was for example a big plus) Last weekend, over a coffee, he talked himself into confusion, saying me staying over would be ""too much"" even though i didn‚Äôt even ask. He reacted defensive again and i told him that i think he‚Äôs having a discussion with himself about my feelings regarding the relationship even though i am practically not allowed to talk about it since two months. He said something like ‚ÄûPf, so would it really help you when i tell you a date when we can talk about it?‚Äú in a bit of a condescending way for which i called him out for. I think he understood in the moment but i went home anyways.

My feelings fluctuate between numbness, anger and sadness. Between compassion and resentment. I understand him, but I also understand myself. I have my own depressive phases, even though he seems to have other things going on as well. I dont fear losing him as a partner at this point. i fear that we both go through this stressful phase right now but still seperate in the end. i dont take it too personnally but im personnally affected in the way that this also concerns my life. i can handle being alone/ single. but i obviously cant handle being alone together. This whole limbo story makes it very difficult to concentrate on my life the longer it goes on.

**TL;DR:**

My boyfriend has been depressed and isolating for at least two months, avoiding any talk about our relationship even though he raised questions about it. We‚Äôve barely seen each other, and when I try to bring it up, he gets defensive. I‚Äôm torn between supporting him and needing clarity‚Äîthis limbo is exhausting. I don‚Äôt fear breaking up as much as I fear dragging this out with no resolution. I can handle being alone, but being stuck in uncertainty is badly messing with my head.

1lk5sfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHJobs/comments/1lk5sfp/pros_and_cons_of_google_operations_center/,Pros and Cons of Google Operations Center Philippines (Scandal from L1S perspective),"Please be advised externally: **Sharing internal screenshots with external parties is prohibited to protect proprietary information. HAHAHA**

Google Operations Center Philippines (GOC) partners with Google to help bring their incredible products and services to life. Our solutions are rooted in technical skill, product expertise, and a deep understanding of customers‚Äô complex needs.

* Most of them are absorbed from Cognizant.

Company Values of Google Operations Center (GOC)

1. **Better Together**
2. **Meaningful Connections**
3. **Work hard, play hard**
4. **Save the day, every day.**
5. **Improve continuously.**
6. **Respect the responsibility.**

I have been with GOC Philippines since dinosaur period, and you won't believe what kind of experience you'll get inside that company. L1S are mostly called internally as Digital Media Advisor or externally as Customer Support.

**Pros:**

* Duration: Only good for 1 - 4 months
* Pantry: Free Breakfast, Lunch, Meryenda, Dinner
* Micro Pantry: Unlimited Snacks such as Milk, Coffee, Tea, Milk Tea, Chocolate, Chips, Biscuit, Dried fruits, Nuts and more.
* Equipment Provided: Laptop, Monitor and Accessories
* Onboarding: It is good very accommodating; will help you boarded right to your designated pod.

**Cons:**

* Training:
   * Training Delivery not that serious most of the time you were forced to slack and eat.
   * Process is not detailed nor discussed during training time. You'll hear most of them on huddle time and you will be technically clueless of what is happening.
   * In training you will also be warned silently that tenure will not treat you well or will not help you during the process.
   * Knowledge Base/Internal/External Article: Most of them are outdated, hidden and gatekept by tenure.

Task schedule injustice; Example: Start date of the task is March 4 and deadline is March 7. Mostly they will talk to you 1 hour before end of shift Match 5 then it will be handed over to you on March 6, which is 1 day before the bloody deadline.

Let's rate them atleast 2.5/10.

* Support Channels:
   * Phone: This is the easiest path mostly you'll receive 1-3 calls per day, and you are going to need full product knowledge to give quality support.
   * Chat: This is the intermediate path where you might receive 3-10 chats per day and require full product knowledge to help clients accordingly.
   * Email: This is the newbie path where you get to learn and explore things from your own pod.

The process here is mixed either that was assigned by Hive a.k.a Workforce or your own pod Queue Managers which are some of your tenure agents that take cases. Hive will assign any cases they want to assign, and Queue Managers will assign cases depending on its own difficulty. Remember: Queue Managers are bias they keep the easiest case for them to increase their own productivity.

Let's rate them atleast 6/10.

* Client Workflow Process:
   * L1G/TechSol (@google.com):
      * L1G agent are mostly from BPO their training is substandard and most of them are providing incomplete troubleshooting process mostly they escalate with L1S consult to get more insights. However, during the process L1S will just push them back due to their invalid consult because most of them won't do any troubleshooting at all, while some do little troubleshooting and L1S new hires are eager to help them, but new hires are advised to push them back and educate them event at the cost of Total Resolution Time for the client.
      * TechSol agent are originally from Google Operations Center itself they are like L1G but most of them had complete generalized training to help external client resolve issues in agile method usually with Google Meet. Whenever they are raising a consult L1S advised them to follow best practices and they're rarely getting pushback on the process.
   * Account Manager (@google.com): They are the internal client or advertiser who works with Google they are well versed with the product and mostly would raise a ticket with either L1G, TechSol or L1S based on the program if they are from Bronze to Platinum.
   * External Client (@intheirowndomain.com): These are clients who uses different domain most of them are categorize from Bronze to Platinum (Never heard of Diamond). External Clients are the people who bring money or doom to GOC. Whenever they raise a ticket based on the program if they are from Bronze to Platinum they might encounter L1G, TechSol or L1S.

Based on L1S perspective. L1G agents are the most mistreated among the consult process. TechSol agents are slightly professionally advised. Account Manager and External Client were the milking cows treated like Kings and Queens during the process. What's worst here is when they had scattered implicit and explicit question that it is required to be addressed word by word or sentence by sentence.

Let's rate them atleast 8/10.

* Support Process:
   * pSME here is not the same as the pSME you had in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) which they standby and help you. The pSME here in GOC Philippines would mostly require you to submit form before they assist you, you'll see them slacking, scrolling and playing mobile games most of the time. They are generous in chat or phone process but mostly when you ask, they won't help you directly and might even gaslight you in the email process.

Let's rate them atleast 2/10.

* Quality Assurance Process:
   * Most of them are friendly they will help you regarding the whole delivery process even in troubleshooting so you can finish early and won't get subjected into a torture process especially if you're a new hire. The process is easy with QA when you ask them but tenure agents and pSME will gatekeep you from reaching out to them by assigning you an L1G or TechSol case. You'll get the real score card with QA and the hard part with QA is that the process takes 15mins to 4hrs depending on their queue and you had to wait, worst is overtime before sending your email. This will highlight the value from the which is **""Improve continuously""**.

Let's rate them atleast 8.5/10.

* Nesting: Nesting part has stage 1 and stage 2. Stage 1 is a weighted quality where tenure agents have a power to evaluate your delivery performance. Stage 2 is the part where pSME will evaluate all of your troubleshooting process. Good luck with this process as said before people on production area won't be so friendly especially if you're a new hire and mostly you'll get gaslighted, mistreated or even subjected to overtime due to superiority complex and power abuse. Think of it as if you're joining masonry or fraternity, while it has mental initiation or task hazing and this will highlight one of their values **""Better Together""**, **""Work hard, play hard""** because you will either ask or will be asked with your tenured buddies. Being in this process is not about how smart you are, how great you are or how well experienced you are, it's how they are pleased.

Let's rate the nesting atleast -4/10.

* New Hire Process: After the nesting duration, you will be subjected to stage 2 and might as well receive a regularization letter, in this process you will understand the meaning of this value ""**Save the day, every day""**. Conditionally after you receive a regularization letter within 6 months, they have a power to retract the regularization contract if your stage 1 result is questionable by sending you another extended training agreement to restart your stage 1. There people will not help you unless you're favored and mostly you are doomed with the process. Imagine you're already more than 6 months in the company and your employment is under threat of termination within 1 month. So, knock-knock department of labor and employment.

Let's rate the new hire process -5/10.

* Tenure: Tenure agents where most likely more than 1 year in the company and if you're a new hire they might be your torture buddies, helping buddies? or NSFW buddies. In short think of them as spawn of the very great Satan. They're here not to make your life easy in GOC, if you get their favor, they might help you but mostly they will torture you and gaslight you within your journey in the company. If you're already in the company as new hire you might be wondering and feel like you're being gatekeep? being under unreasonable overtime? Tenure, pSME and queue managers are the 99.9% culprit.

Let's rate them atleast -9/10.

* Culture: GOC culture is fun you will understand the meaning of this value ""**Meaningful Connections**"". They have a lot of external activities, but do not expect if they had especial designated time for team building. Team buildings do really happen at your very rest day. Special occasions mostly happened on weekends. They are very much LGBT friendly you'll see a lot of drag queens over there. Overtime? it is allowed 3hrs a day so if you get overtime for atleast 7-9hrs and passionately wants to resolve all of your cases it's a bye-bye OTY, you'll know it is the Tenured, pSME and queue managers are the 99.9% culprit of this scheme. Benefits? GOC is much better with benefits and retirement also with medical assistance, it is for you to discover these wonderful things.

Let's rate them atleast 6.5/10.

* Workmates: Once you get tenured issues are still there and you are advised to make the life new hire's doomed to hell even if you don't want to and if you're kindhearted you will always find a way to help a person even if that betrays you and this ""**Respect the responsibility""** value will attest a challenge to keep things secret. You might as well think of new job opportunities or get apply for internal job postings. The quality of life there has an expectancy of 1 - 2 years then mostly you go to another pod or resign.

Let's rate them atleast 4.5/10

* Gossip: Gossip is the worst part of the scenario either you get betrayed, gets highlighted as great example for flattery and deceit. Well, it is true that there are lots of NSFW there, but it happens outside the office. There you'll hear stories from another pod a cheating issue where a new hire girl breaks up with his filipino fiancee from US and deny marriage proposal then the next three weeks you'll hear stories about her doing some other night in her apartment with a long-time tenure drunk while his girlfriend ringing his phone. Another thing is a gay who run away with his laptop and did not send it back exhausting all the leaves until leaving without prior notice and you'll never hear from him. Next is group of new hire with high attrition rate thinking about everyday resignation and gossiping about when will they resign due to hardcore nesting process. Lastly is that you might encounter one of your former friends that you become a true friend helped a lot then the next day they will put you down after getting some attention with another people.

Let's rate them atleast 3.5/10

Now count the overall rating : )

If you have any questions or clarifications, please feel free to ask! Other redditors and gossipers are here to help!

1lk5q7q,https://i.redd.it/wiswo0zcs29f1.jpeg,Update: my Slimeminator slimes arrived! I thought the company wasn‚Äôt making slimes anymore but here they are!,"Hi everyone! 

10 days ago I made a post about how I was worried Slimeminator wasn‚Äôt sending out their slimes. I hadn‚Äôt received mine for several weeks after the anticipated delivery date, and the tracking hadn‚Äôt updated at all in the time I had been waiting. I had sent 2 messages to the Slimeminator account with no response and I saw a review saying they never received the slimes they had paid for. 

However, today they showed up! I got 3: gingerbread butter, biebs cold brew, and apple pie cubes.

My review:
1. APPLE PIE CUBES 
- really nice smell that literally smells like the filling of apple pie, I could eat it (I won‚Äôt) 
- very sticky even after a lot of activator, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll come together with some more manipulation 
- jelly like texture with cubes in it, it feels so nice and it‚Äôll make great pops I‚Äôm sure 
- has cute little apple charms in it, I didn‚Äôt even notice at first that‚Äôs how small they are but they‚Äôre so cutesy!!

2. BIEBS COLD BREW
- very subtle coffee scent, I wish it was stronger!! I prefer more noticeable scents: this one is glue-first and then coffee after. But the coffee scent that does come through is lovely 
- also super super sticky even after a ton of activator, will be adding more and hoping to just work it in so I can play with it without it sticking all over me 
- comes with a white vanilla slime add in that mixes in and makes the best coffee colours 
- jelly like texture that‚Äôs popping and feels so nice!! 

3. GINGERBREAD BUTTER
- again, very very subtle scent. I was hoping gingerbread would be almost overwhelming in its scent because I love that smell 
- texture is sooo buttery, I can tell I‚Äôm going to be a fan of touching this one! Not overly sticky at all and only needed a little activator! Didn‚Äôt come with any sort of adds in 

Overall, I like what arrived and I‚Äôll definitely be playing with it a ton, and my main issues are that the scents are way more subtle than my general preference and that I need a ton of activator to be able to play with them but ultimately I‚Äôm happy! :) ",4,1750858214.0,Slime,0,1.0,False

A family vacation should not be all about cramming days full of things to do, but it should be more about creating family moments that will leave everyone with a magical feeling, and your children, in particular. Dubai has more than enough to offer, be it theme parks, beaches, educational marvels, and fascinating rides. But what will you do, or where should you start? What really works with your family speed?

Did you ever type in kids' activities in Dubai and end up choking on a never-ending list of the same old things over and over again? If so, then this guide is your way out of that nightmare. Let us create an itinerary that does not suck - not only in terms of the energy of a child but also in terms of the sanity of a parent.

# Day 1: Arrival + Discovery

Booking a Family-friendly Hotel Should Be The First Priority

We recommend staying near Downtown (most hotels in this area are family-friendly) or closer to Jumeirah Beach Residence, which will put you more places to eat, attractions, and kid-friendly amenities.

Evening at The Dubai Fountain

The fountain show in the evening will mesmerize your children without tiring them after being on a plane all day!

Pro Tip: Day one should not be overscheduled. There is no rush to see what Dubai has to offer until everyone is well-rested.

# Day 2: Fun Culture

Dubai [Frame](https://dubaitravelblog.wixsite.com/blog/post/guide-to-dubai-frame) in the morning

This huge golden edifice provides panoramic scenery of Old and New Dubai- a smooth, interesting beginning of the day. Children will find it interesting to walk on the bridge that is made of glass, and parents will be immersed in the clash of tradition and modernity.

Afternoon in Dubai Museum or Etihad Museum

Catch their attention by displaying the image of how Dubai appeared 50 years ago. These are small, pictorial, and interesting to even children.

# Day 3: Skyscrapers, Sand, and Skyline

Morning Burj Khalifa -The Top

Finding the world's tallest building in Dubai is the most monumental accomplishment for many travelers, so why would you be any different? Buy the Burj Khalifa tickets online for no lines. The kids will love the elevator ride as it zooms up to 124 stories in 1 minute, which is super futuristic.

The Dubai Mall lunch is late.

It is suitable for families because there is enough space for strollers or finicky children and because all the cuisines are under one roof. After lunch, visit the Aquarium and take a glance at sharks, rays, and the giant glass tunnel.

Seasonal Evening in the Global Village

Don't miss these multicultural carnival rides, food of the world, live performances, and magical atmosphere, especially when you visit during the cooler months (October to April).

# Day 4: Theme Park Extravaganza

Dubai Parks and Resorts is a paradise built with families in mind. You can split this across two days if you have more time, but here's how to squeeze the best out of one:

Start at MOTIONGATE Dubai:

Think of it as Hollywood in the desert. With attractions based on Shrek, Madagascar, and Kung Fu Panda, it caters well to kids between 4‚Äì12.

Break at Riverland:

This walkable dining district inside the resort offers everything from coffee to burgers. Great spot to catch your breath.

Afternoon at Bollywood Parks

If your kids enjoy music and drama, you should not miss visiting these perks.

# Day 5: Beach Day + Light Adventure

Morning at Kite Beach or La Mer

Wide open spaces, shallow waves, and playgrounds make this perfect for young ones.

Optional: Rent a family paddleboard

Or just let the kids enjoy the splash pads and slides available onsite.

Dubai Marina Walk evening walk

A beautiful stroll as you look back on your last night, family-friendly dining, live music, and the ability to work off those last couple of vacation meals.

# The Role of Timing and Balance

An ideal family travel plan will include a mix of play and rest time, will be flexible, and account for naps, tears, and snack time.

This is necessary, and parents do not give much thought beyond:

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Time wasted in transit: It can take hours to get between attractions. Putting groups together by area.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Booking fatigue: There is too much planning, and spontaneity is killed. Reserve some half-days.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Not getting overstimulated: Not every day must be an adrenaline-filled day.

# Extra Advice on a Smooth [Family Trip](https://dubaitravelwiki.wordpress.com/2025/06/22/perfect-family-weekend-in-dubai/)

To prevent unnecessary time wastage in long queues, pre-book as much as you can.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dress according to the weather: it is cold in the malls and hot in the afternoon.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bring external batteries: the gadgets of children can save their lives in an emergency.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Nol Card allows traveling by metro and tram. It is cheap and also entertaining for children.

# Conclusion: Memories, NOT mishaps

Our hectic schedule always makes us busier. But finding time to explore extraordinary things with your family helps us to restart.¬† However, the magic is in the planning done behind the trip and not the number of places you visit. Whatever the nature of your grandeur, gazing at skyscrapers, floating in aquariums, or simply laughing on the beach, the equilibrium of it all will create the moment.

Do not forget to pre-book the necessities in advance, such as LEGOLAND Dubai tickets, especially during holidays when the seats are taken in a short period. Having done the heavy lifting beforehand, you can be left to bask in the delight.",0,1750858085.0,roadtrip,0,0.5,False

Daniel Marris cupped his mug between cold, tired hands. The faint warmth from the cup was a whisper against the chill. He never meant to feel like this, so insensate, so small.

Ashbridge wasn‚Äôt the kind of college town that welcomed people like him. Not with its sleek buildings, gene-printed students, and families boasting generational wealth. Daniel came from the edge of industry, a place of worn-out boots, broken heaters, and dinners stretched with boxed rice. His mom hadn‚Äôt worked since the accident that mangled her back. His dad worked double shifts on scaffolds. Daniel‚Äôs acceptance into Ashbridge‚Äôs engineering program had been a glimmer of hope, but it came with a cost.

*The Sensory Cost.*

He thought back to speaking with student services. ‚ÄúYou can pay with cash, with time, or you can pay with a sense.‚Äù A brutal and excruciating practice, born out of the student debt crisis that left half a generation bankrupt. Now, students from working- and middle-class backgrounds could pay for college with their senses, losing a sense either all at once or in scheduled increments.

Most students gave up their sense of taste, a way to save money and avoid the freshman fifteen. A few brave souls surrendered their hearing or sight.

Daniel chose touch.

He reasoned it would be the least disruptive to his mechanical engineering degree. He could still read off the board, listen to lectures, and enjoy the free food at campus events. Unfortunately, the impact of this decision was far greater than he expected.

By the end of the fall semester of his sophomore year, Daniel had already surrendered over 40% of his tactile input. He could still type, still write, but the sensation of pen on paper felt like scribbling on air. He noticed it most in the cold: the numbness in his fingers didn‚Äôt sting. Ashbridge winters were sharp and bitter, but to Daniel, this winter arrived like a ghost.

Daniel sat at his dorm desk, sipping coffee that tasted bitter and metallic. To him, it felt lukewarm despite the visible steam. He tried not to think about the sensation he was missing. He couldn‚Äôt think about it, the thought only fed the ever-growing dread in his stomach. Sitting before him, on the coffee-ring-stained desk, there was another payment notice.

‚ÄúSEMESTER PAYMENT DUE: Failure to remit may result in administrative lockout.‚Äù

This payment would require another 30% of his remaining touch, enough to dull nearly everything but the sharpest pain.

Daniel stood shakily. He struggled to steady himself between his dread and the fuzzy, nearly numb feeling in his feet. The sensation, or lack thereof, was like a crawling numbness, a fizzing static. Daniel had grown accustomed to the hollow tingling his body now felt. As he exited his dorm, he remembered to grab his jacket. Even if he couldn‚Äôt feel the cold of winter, the cold could still bite him.

As he walked to the payment clinic, he found himself thinking of the children he used to hear about on his mother‚Äôs daytime television shows; children born without the ability to feel. Congenital analgesia: the inability to feel pain. Most kids with this syndrome died within their first three years. A few reached their early to mid-twenties. Daniel planned to graduate in two and a half years. If he couldn‚Äôt pony up the money for his junior year, he would be left without any sense of touch. He wouldn‚Äôt be able to feel any pain. The dread in his stomach jerked at the thought of surviving nearly two years without touch or pain at all.

As Daniel approached the steps of the payment clinic, he shook his head, trying to physically shake the idea from his mind. The payment clinic was a nondescript building on the edge of campus. To a passerby, there would be no way to guess that young students were sacrificing their senses, their connections to the world, in an effort for a better future. Inside was clinical and sterile; Daniel noted the intense scent of alcohol and disinfectant as he stepped through the glass doors.

‚ÄúYou still have options,‚Äù the blonde-haired clerk said flatly, without looking up from her terminal. ‚ÄúWe can schedule the extraction for tomorrow or next week. If you wish to defer with loans, you‚Äôll need co-signers. Parents?‚Äù

Daniel shook his head. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Ä¶ my dad already works two jobs. Mom can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôd recommend scheduling the payment.‚Äù

Daniel scheduled his appointment for tomorrow, ignoring the dread now gnawing at his insides. As he turned to leave, he overheard two students whispering near the doors.

‚ÄúShe can barely function,‚Äù snickered a tall, tan girl, whom Daniel recognized from his Human-Machine Ergonomics class.

‚ÄúShe basically has no senses since her last payment. You would think she‚Äôd have gotten a job by now,‚Äù said the other girl, slightly shorter with an olive complexion, mockingly.

‚ÄúMaybe she wants to be one of those,‚Äù the first girl paused, making a face of disgust, ‚Äúinactives.‚Äù Both girls snickered.

As Daniel passed them, he kept his eyes lowered. He didn‚Äôt want to be noticed, not here of all places.

*Inactives*, he thought, his dread deepening. The word clung to him like frost on the world around him. Inactives, or inactive citizens, were individuals who lost all their senses and were deemed devoid of any fiscal utility.

He knew who those girls were talking about. It was hard not to. Mara, a once beautiful and lithe girl Daniel met during freshman orientation. At the time, she‚Äôd left him flustered with her brilliant smile and bubbly personality. Now she was the personification of the grim consequences Daniel dreaded. He wasn‚Äôt sure whether it was out of morbid curiosity or genuine concern that he wanted to see her.

He found Mara on the campus fringe, hunched beside her car, the engine long dead and windows fogged from nights of breath. She was crouched on thin, trembling legs, reaching for a half-drank bottle of water that lay just out of reach under her car.

Daniel approached her, heart pounding in his ears but not in his chest. He didn‚Äôt know what to say.

‚ÄúI got it,‚Äù he said, raising his voice as much as he could. Mara jumped, clearly unaware she had been approached. Daniel lowered himself prone onto the rough, cold asphalt, which registered little to him. He grabbed the bottle of water, accidentally denting it with the force of his grasp.

He stood carefully, making sure not to stumble or waver in public.

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù He handed her the bottle slowly enough for her to register its presence.

Mara blinked slowly, her green eyes struggling to find his. She was ghostlike and thin. She grasped the cold bottle as best as she could.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù she said cautiously, taking a step back.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Daniel, Daniel Marris, from freshman orientation,‚Äù he said nervously in a loud voice.

Mara took a moment to process his words.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while.‚Äù She laughed nervously. Daniel went through the motions of small talk. He desperately didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge her current state. But as they spoke, a morbid need to understand welled up inside him. As their simple pleasantries began to end, without thinking, Daniel blurted, ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù He realized how rude he sounded, but his dread controlled his tongue. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ how did it get this bad?‚Äù

Mara gave a weak smile; her voice was flat.

‚ÄúMy dad lost his job right before the start of freshman year. I couldn‚Äôt afford tuition.‚Äù She inhaled sharply, fighting tears. ‚ÄúI started with taste. Figured I wouldn‚Äôt miss it much. Then I gave up touch, it didn‚Äôt seem important at the time.‚Äù This statement stung Daniel. ‚ÄúAfter that, smell. Then bit by bit my sight.‚Äù

Daniel‚Äôs throat tightened. ‚ÄúAnd your hearing?‚Äù

‚ÄúStill have most of it,‚Äù she said, glancing toward the overcast sky. Daniel was unsure of how much she could really take in of it. Mara continues, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt drive anymore. Can‚Äôt keep up in lectures. No one‚Äôs gonna hire me like this.‚Äù

Daniel looked down guiltily. She was a mirror of his fears. Mara reached into her coat and pulled out a small object: a worry stone, verdant and speckled with golds and browns, smooth except for a deep thumb-groove worn through use.

‚ÄúI want to give you this.‚Äù She placed it in his hand. Her fingers didn‚Äôt twitch. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need it anymore.‚Äù

Daniel looked down at the stone in his palm. It was still warm from her hand, or at least he thought it was. Maybe he just remembered what warmth used to feel like. He didn‚Äôt want to tell her he could barely feel its cool, silken curve, no more than a ghost in his hand.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he said, voice low.

Mara nodded once. ‚ÄúI use it to remind myself I‚Äôm still here.‚Äù

Daniel looked down at the smooth stone, turning it slowly in his palm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... nice. Thank you.‚Äù He kicked himself internally for being so awkward. He already had a hard enough time talking to girls, but he was ill-equipped to say anything more meaningful to her.

Mara‚Äôs gaze drifted toward her car, empty and quiet.

‚ÄúI need to sleep,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúThe back seat stays warm enough, most nights.‚Äù

She turned without waiting for a reply and opened the driver‚Äôs side door. With a slow, practiced motion, she crawled into the back, curled up like a shadow folding into itself. The door shut with a soft click.

Daniel stood on the curb, half relieved the conversation was over, the stone in his hand cooling fast in the fading afternoon light.

That night, as Daniel walked home through silent streets dusted with ice, he ran his fingers over the stone, hoping to glean the feeling of Mara‚Äôs touch through it.

That night, Daniel stared at the ceiling above his bed. His dread growing, aching his stomach. The thought of Mara haunted him, feeding his dread larger. The memory of touch surfaced like a whisper. He thought of not feeling his mother‚Äôs hugs, nor the warmth of coffee cutting through cold mornings, and not being able to recreate the thrill of skin-on-skin contact that he had experienced during his first time the summer after high school.

He tried bargaining with his own mind: Just finish the degree. Get a job. Pay to restore the nerves.

But he‚Äôd read the fine print. Reversals were inconsistent. Sometimes nerves didn‚Äôt reactivate. Sometimes sensation came back wrong, pain where there should be pleasure. Sometimes nothing returned at all.

He squeezed the worry stone until his knuckles whitened. He could still feel it. Faintly. He didn‚Äôt know if that was comforting or horrifying.

The next morning, the day of payment, had arrived.

The dread inside him thrashed him awake.

On his way to the payment clinic, he took the long way to see Mara. She was gone. Her car sat on the curb, empty and frosted over. The dread clawed at Daniel‚Äôs insides.

It wasn‚Äôt until he had walked through the glass doors of the payment clinic that he realized he had forgotten his jacket. The cold bit him, but he perceived it as barely a chill. Daniel only saw his hands, red, their protests against the cold going unnoticed.

Daniel sat in the waiting room, surrounded by other students with blank faces and nervous postures. No one spoke. He rubbed the worry stone. Its surface was familiar now. His thumb traced the groove obsessively.

They called his name. ‚ÄúMarris, Daniel.‚Äù

The procedure room was white. Clean. Inhuman. He sat down. The technician didn‚Äôt speak. The procedure lasted only a few minutes.

Then came the numbness.

Outside, the world looked the same.

But the air felt distant. The cold, unimportant.

Daniel gripped the worry stone again.

Nothing.

He stared at it, a deep and vibrant green, like her eyes. Turned it in his hand. No texture. No warmth.

He stood there on the payment clinic‚Äôs steps, watching the stone like it might speak, like it might cry out.

But it was silent.

Daniel didn‚Äôt cry. He didn‚Äôt scream.

The dread that had lived in his stomach was now the only thing he could feel.

1lk5hal,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalLifeHacks/comments/1lk5hal/can_lactose_intolerance_cause_diarrhea_heres_what/,Can lactose intolerance cause diarrhea? Here‚Äôs what finally helped me stop it,"If you‚Äôve ever asked yourself *‚Äúcan lactose intolerance cause diarrhea?‚Äù* \- the short answer is **yes**. But I didn‚Äôt always know that. For a long time, I just thought my stomach was sensitive. I‚Äôd eat a bowl of cereal or grab an iced coffee with milk, and within an hour... I‚Äôd regret it. Bad.

I used to brush it off as food poisoning or ‚Äúsomething I ate.‚Äù But when it kept happening, I finally connected the dots. It wasn‚Äôt random, it was dairy. And I had lactose intolerance.

**Why dairy can send you running to the bathroom**

If your body can‚Äôt produce enough **lactase** (the enzyme that breaks down lactose), the undigested lactose gets dumped into your large intestine. There, it ferments, and that process can cause **gas, bloating, cramps, and yes‚Ä¶ diarrhea**.

Everyone reacts a little differently. Some people get backed up. Some get gassy. For me, it was a fast-track ticket to bathroom misery.

**The moment I accepted it was lactose intolerance**

The turning point was a trip to a brunch buffet. I had a couple slices of quiche, some creamy potatoes, and a yogurt parfait. Within 30 minutes, I was *done*. The rest of my day was toast.

I looked back and realized: this wasn‚Äôt new. It was happening over and over, every time I had dairy-heavy meals. So I finally faced it, I had lactose intolerance, and I needed to stop pretending otherwise.

**What finally helped: one tiny pill that** ***actually*** **worked**

I‚Äôd tried a few over-the-counter enzyme pills before, but I either needed to take three of them, or they didn‚Äôt do much. Then someone in a food allergy group mentioned **DairyPill**.

I was skeptical again, but what caught my attention was how strong it is. **Each DairyPill has 18,000 FCC units of lactase**, which is up to 6X more than many of the store brands I had been using.

I gave it a shot, and wow. It worked. One pill before a dairy-heavy meal, and I was fine. Not ‚Äúless sick‚Äù, actually fine.

If you want to check it out, here‚Äôs the link I used:  
[**DairyPill Official Page**](https://getdairypill.com/offer-01/?lpid=1059&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1059&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1059&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1059&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks)

**How I use it now**  
I take one DairyPill before my first bite of anything with dairy, even if it‚Äôs just coffee with cream or a slice of pizza. Since I started, no more bloating, no more bathroom runs, no more wondering if I‚Äôll be able to leave the house after eating.

Bonus: it comes with a small keychain pod so I can carry it anywhere. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even think about it anymore. It‚Äôs just part of my meal routine.

**So yes - lactose intolerance can cause diarrhea. But you‚Äôre not stuck with it**

If your stomach flips after dairy, or you get those ‚Äúmystery‚Äù reactions hours later, it might not be random. It might be lactose intolerance showing up in its own way.

For me, **DairyPill** was the thing that finally made dairy enjoyable again, and stopped the cycle of eating regret.

I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has found this to be true. Did you experience diarrhea more than other symptoms? And if you found something that helped, drop it below, always down to compare notes.",1,1750857583.0,NaturalLifeHacks,0,1.0,False

1lk5gwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lk5gwh/super_confused_trying_to_go_with_the_flow/,Super Confused - trying to go with the flow.,"Fair warning, this might be kind of long. 
I have a guy friend, we met online and he lives in Eastern Europe. I‚Äôm in The US. We got super super close and then had a falling out. I caught feelings and he said he never did but honestly I think he just never wanted commitment and the idea of me liking him pushed him away. He definitely runs avoidant and I of course run slightly anxious but not terribly. 
Fast forward to 9 months after we stopped talking and he is telling me he is here, for 3 months and asks to buy me coffee.. acts like nothing ever happened and we are best buds again. 
We meet, he buys me coffee takes me to lunch, he‚Äôs a gentleman about it all.. holds doors. We reconnect we have fun.. he stays over and we cuddle. Great, cool, fun. He makes no moves to kiss me but the cuddling is very intimate, pretty sure he had an erection at one point. 
We hang out again, he‚Äôs more flirty, closer.. feeding me fries and laughing a lot. He stays over again.. we are even more close. He hugs me, holds me, plays with my hair, places my hands deliberately on him and has me play with his hair. I decided to kiss his cheek and that was it. He made no other moves. 
So the next day I ask him for clarity around what this is.. and things got kind of weird. I said ‚ÄúI need clarity around what this is.. I don‚Äôt really cuddle like this with my friends‚Äù and what I meant was - ‚Äúis this strictly platonic for you or is this romantic also?‚Äù. I think he thought I was asking him to define the relationship and I‚Äôm not. He told me it felt clingy to ask and honestly it kind of made me mad. He told me he never liked me romantically in the past and then shows up asking to meet and buy me coffee. I just want to know if I can make a move or if that also would be too much. It‚Äôs like I have to walk on eggshells because of our past and I feel like I‚Äôm in highschool with how things are moving. The relationship can not be more than friends with benefits ever, for me. He‚Äôs moving back to his country in 3 months and he is younger than me by quite a bit. We somehow have this bond though and cuddling felt even more intimate! 
My issue is that I want to kiss him.. I want to move a little faster and maybe I shouldn‚Äôt?? I think kissing solidifies for me, where we stand. I struggle with the grey area but I am also pretty deprived in this area since I have been single and alone for a long time. I‚Äôm also willing to just spend the summer with this person but not if we are only ever going to cuddle, I would like to keep my options open for deeper intimacy but maybe I need to be doing that regardless.

I need some perspective and maybe a way to clear the air with him. I definitely freaked him out and I think shared a little too much. I still talk to my ex who has cancer and is my friend, and some other guy friend recently messaged me wanting to hang out. I told my European ‚Äúfriend‚Äù this and he seemed unbothered but I never truly know because he is so flippant and nonchalant. It makes my head spin a bit. ",1,1750857554.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

The best one I can easily say is oatmilk, mostly oatly. Good taste and texture when steamed. But my digestive system can't handle oatmilk every day, I just get foggy and bloated after a few days of daily lattes. So I tried to find an alternative.

Tried many almond milks but tbh can't stand the taste. By itself it tastes good, but if I use it with coffee I can't stand it. I assume many of you are like me. 

I kept trying different milks and a couple of weeks ago I went to a farmers market and found walnuts by the pound for decently cheap. Thought to myself, should I try making walnut milk? So I went for it and woah! Using an ok-ish blender (nothing expensive but not like 20 bucks blender) and a nut milk bag, I get very good walnut milk. Trick to make it ""barista"" style was just add a few grams of powdered sunflower lecithin.

All these said, I would go back to oatly if my body could handle oatmilk everyday lol but at the same time it's good to make very simple and healthy walnut milk which tastes quite good with coffee.",0,1750857447.0,espresso,3,0.33,False

I've dreamed of my crush twice. Unlike my previous crushes na napanaginipan ko rin, I know this hits different kasi it felt so genuine, and (like one of the posts na nabasa ko dito sa reddit before) minsan may residue nung feelings kahit nagising na ako. Actually, even now kahit medyo matagal na siyang nangyari, I still feel it. 

First time ko siyang napanaginipan he was at our house, drinking coffee. My mom is a good florist, magaling siyang mag arrange ng flowers, may it be plastic, ribbon, or natural flowers. In my dreams, my crush was having a coffee sa sala namin until my mom gave him a boquet na ginawa niya (my crush is gay btw haha) tapos nakita ko sobrang tuwang tuwa siya to the point na nagpaturo pa siya sa mama ko paano gawin. Then, as dreams tend to be weird, bigla nalang siyang naglaho sa scene. So I let it pass. 

Second time na napanaginipan ko siya sobrang shookt na talaga ako kasi BAKIT?? Hindi ko naman siya iniisip at sinusubukan ko na nga i-uncrush tapos lalabas naman sa panaginip ko langhiya. Anyway, the second time was so genuine, bigla ko nalang siyang nakita sa kitchen namin na nagluluto (he's a chef too!) then nung nakita niya ako tinawag niya ako tapos tinuruan magluto (parang wattpad lang lol) AS IN!! YUNG KILIG KO 1M/10. Nakalimutan ko na kung anong niluto namin, pero while I was checking yung pagkain, umalis siya tapos tumabi siya sa mama ko sa lamesa at nakipagkwentuhan, again nagkakape ulit siya. Tapos sobrang animated nung kwentuhan nila at yung mama ko tuwang tuwa rin sa kanya (siguro kasi nga funny siya) then biglang naglabas ng phone yung mama ko tapos nakipagselfie sa kanya, tapos nakita ko talaga sobrang saya nilang dalawa üò≠. Tapos ayun, nawala ulit siya sa scene. May mga nangyari pa after nila magselfie pero ayan nalang naalala ko. 

Sorry kung magulo ako magkwento, I just want to share what I felt that time, kasi sobrang genuine talaga ng interaction nila ng mama ko, and the fact na casual din siyang tumatambay sa bahay. Looking back, never naman akong umasa na baka may chance ako sa kanya kasi (1) he's gay, (2) magkalayo social status namin. He's rich rich, and ako baby girl lang sa kanto namin. Kahit nga sa panaginip ko he looks so out of place eh, like he's not meant for that kind of environment (low-middle income class). Anyway, ayun lang, skl naman haha.

Everybody had canceled on me but that did not stop me in the slightest from committing to some awesome plans. I did so much in such a short amount of time and found many new places for me to try and check out. It was an absolutely stunning day. Here is what was on the agenda:

*Woke up and got ready and let my Mom's dogs out

*Got a coffee at my favorite bakery saying hi to the owner who told me she liked the jam in the donuts

*Met one of the workers for the first time

*Headed to my favorite diner to try their monthly specials

*Played Pocket while eating and interacting with the waitress 

*Left to go hiking for a bit until ice cream place opened

*Found a butcher shop and smokehouse on my way to waterfall

The butcher shop I stopped at was gorgeous. It was everything I wished my place of work was. It had goods besides meat and the workers all seemed friendly. It had fresh bread, cheese, and treats. It had sauces and dressings and smoked products to check out. I bought Mellini to try on my hike which was divine. A place I will be back to in the future. Possibly even next week. 

*Hiked for an hour checking out a gorgeous waterfall below and above it

I took pictures of the waterfall even taking selfies because I actually felt confident enough to do so. I felt good and the beauty around me was worth it. I even felt good hiking without getting out of breath or feeling any pain. All the cardio is really helping to make my body stronger. It feels good that I can do more and more and not feel exhausted after some time. 

*Left to go check out the local town and a couple shops for ceramics, metalworking, and books

*Saw soccer and boxing bro talking to them for a hot minute

I am a 59-year-old attorney who has battled with worsening misophonia for over thirty years. I can assure that anyone who claims that misophonia does not lead to violence has no idea what they are talking about. Severe misophonia is incredibly painful and I think about ending my life all the time. I am not alone. 

A simple search on Reddit for ‚Äúmisophonia suicide‚Äù reveals in stark relief how many people with this largely ignored condition are literally suicidal. People have lost everything because of misophonia. Yet, the reality is that most people with misophonia don‚Äôt know they have it. Most mental health professionals have never heard of it. Most lawyers have never heard of it, either. 

I have read article after article about people who have murdered others because of a sound or volume of sound that they were controlling that enraged the person who committed the murder. In each and every case, they describe the same symptoms as I and scores of others with misophonia experience. 

A cursory internet search for Ted Kazinski‚Äôs noise issues perfectly describes a man with misophonia who did everything possible to remove himself from a society filled with triggers. He only became homicidal when society‚Äôs industrial sounds later followed him to his office-the-grid property in Montana. The man was being tortured by sounds. He even repeatedly complained about sound in prison before eventually committing suicide. His Luddite philosophy is completely in keeping with many misophones‚Äô desire to escape certain trigger sounds. 

The New York Post ran an article years ago about Dr. Marrese committing suicide because of misophonia. Even her best friends did not suspect that misophonia was the cause. We are mocked, shamed, vilified, terminated when we speak up. We tend to suffer in silence, until we can‚Äôt take it anymore. Businesses and institutions ridicule our requests for reasonable accommodations on the regular and vilify us. 

I have been trying to advocate for me and others suffering from misophonia since moving back to Pasadena. I have been TRO‚Äôed, rendered homeless, manhandled and 51/50‚Äôed by the police, as a result of my constitutional rights have been trampled with a smirk by none other than law enforcement. Peet‚Äôs Coffee shamelessly used racial cliches to trespass me for requesting reasonable accommodations‚Äîand it received support from the police officer I summoned. 

Not one mandatory reporter, including seven police officers, has taken action to investigate the welfare of children with misophonia who have been announcing their suicides for years. And they will not be charged for violating the law. 

This country needs to wake up to the reality that misophonia can and does destroy lives, ruin families, and has been the motivating factor behind suicide, battery and murder. 

The APA‚Äôs failure to include misophonia in the DSM because it is holding ‚Äúheated debates‚Äù about whether it is a medical condition or a mental health condition has left so many people in the dark that therapists are routinely committing malpractice because they think they can cure this oddity no problem. 

The APA should be held accountable for not properly addressing this condition and relying on scant evidence that misophonia cannot drive people to suicide, battery or murder. 

I am tired of trying to sound the alarm to institutions that are blatantly ignoring the facts and choosing to play down the fact that children with misophonia have been announcing their suicides on Reddit for years. 

I am keeping records of everyone I have informed, so that I can present them at the inevitable Senate hearing. 

This is a willful, wanton and reckless American tragedy.

1lk4vl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lk4vl9/the_office_ergonomics_wars/,The Office Ergonomics Wars,"

It all started with a lightbulb.

Phil from Maintenance, a seasoned vet of ceiling tiles and bad decisions, was just trying to change the flickering fluorescent above Conference Room B. He'd fixed everything from frozen thermostats to leaking ceiling tiles with little more than tape and grit. But this time, the step ladder was, according to rumor, ""locked in the supply cage,"" which meant it was likely just inconveniently far away. So Phil did what Phil always did: he improvised.

He wheeled in an old office chair. One of those high-backed, overstuffed things with uneven wheels and mysterious upholstery stains. With a grunt and the groan of overworked hydraulics, Phil climbed up one side arm, then balanced himself with a hand on the ceiling tile. For a moment, it seemed stable.

Then the swivel betrayed him.

The chair spun like a game show wheel with no prize, dumping Phil onto the carpet in a tangle of arms, legs, and bureaucratic liability. A hush fell over the floor. Someone dropped their coffee. The intern, eyes wide, whispered the words that would light the match:

""This could've been avoided... with proper ergonomics.""

From that moment, something shifted.

At first, it was subtle. Tina in Accounts Payable quietly requisitioned a split keyboard. She said it was for wrist pain, but everyone knew it was more than that. She was declaring independence, stepping out from under the standard-issue regime. Her wrists floated comfortably on gel clouds, and she radiated the quiet power of someone who would never get carpal tunnel again.

Dan in HR was the first to push back. He had a long-standing aversion to change, particularly if it came wrapped in anything resembling comfort. ""Non-standard equipment,"" he grumbled, like it was a slur, highlighting a dusty section of the employee handbook no one had laid eyes on since the Y2K scare. He printed three copies and taped one to the kitchen fridge.

Dan had also been the poor soul responsible for filing the incident report on Phil's fall. It was a bureaucratic epic, a twenty-three-page saga bound in a manila folder with hand-tabbed sections. There were five witness statements, each contradicting the last, a risk matrix diagram shaded with alarming reds and oranges, and a photo of the broken chair labeled ""EXHIBIT C,"" framed like evidence that belonged in a Law & Order episode. The report included a speculative reconstruction of Phil's trajectory using clipart silhouettes, and a flowchart titled ""Possible Chain of Negligence."" Dan stayed late three nights completing it, sighing with the weight of his own diligence. Ever since, he treated ergonomic upgrades like a personal affront, muttering about ""slippery slopes"" and ""budget overreach."" He viewed Tina's split keyboard not as an aid, but as a breach in protocol, a crack in the dam he had sworn to guard, and under his watchful eye, no more changes would be tolerated.

Tina ignored him. Then copied the very section he had cited, printed it, and used it to prop up her monitor to eye level.

That was when the reams began.

Stacks of paper appeared across the office, lifting monitors like homemade monuments to neck health. People started measuring ""screen tilt angles"" and using words like ""biomechanical efficiency"" in casual conversation. Jenny from Design built her own riser out of candle jars and bamboo placemats and posted her design in the shared drive under the filename: rise_up_final_FINAL.pdf.

New hires with old monitors sat lower than the veterans. It wasn't a hierarchy anymore, it was a spinal caste system.

Dan, enraged by what he saw as anarchy wrapped in lumbar support, launched his own crusade. He drafted a ten-point initiative to restore ""functional seating compliance,"" the heart of which demanded the replacement of every chair in the office with identical, stackable, armless chairs with no wheels. ""Mobility breeds chaos,"" he muttered darkly during an all-staff email thread no one had actually invited him to. He distributed flyers titled ""The Myth of Mesh"" and brought in a sample chair from a decades-old vendor catalog. It was gray, hard as moral clarity, and made a sound like a dying violin when you sat in it. He called it ""The Standard.""

Then came the Great Chair Grab.

One morning, all the good chairs were gone.

The ergonomic models, the ones with tension controls and breathable mesh backs, vanished. Only the budget chairs remained: stiff, heavy, with the unmistakable scent of sadness. No one claimed responsibility, but Gary in IT began sitting unusually tall. Suspiciously tall. Whispers spread. Some said he had intercepted the Facilities manifest. Others claimed he had set up an underground chair railroad, quietly ferrying ergonomic chairs to secret locations across the building-storage closets, locked server rooms, and even the HR file archive. Gary spoke little, but he moved like a man with lumbar support and a mission. He was once seen emerging from a janitor's closet, arms full of mesh-backed freedom, whispering: ""Not today, Dan. Not today.""

Within days, a rogue department barricaded the Marketing War Room and declared it a sanctuary for ""Ergonomic Autonomy."" Inside, they had standing desks, balance boards, and one of those weird kneeling chairs no one knew how to use. Someone strung up Christmas lights. It became the promised land.

Elsewhere, the war splintered.

People took sides over mice: trackballs, vertical, ergonomic, wireless. Barry from DevOps taped a gaming mouse to his wrist and claimed it shaved milliseconds off his productivity. When Legal ordered stylus tablets for ""document markup,"" everyone knew it was just a flex.

A silent judgment settled into the air. You could hear it in every scroll.

Dan and HR struck back hard. They launched a new training series with pastel slides and vaguely Scandinavian music. The phrase ""neutral spine"" was repeated 57 times. Participation was tracked. Completion badges were printed. But the real blow came with the rollout of Dan's vision.

The stackable, armless, wheel-less chairs, ""The Standard"", began to arrive by the truckload. Each one gray, humorless, and ergonomically hostile. They were installed overnight, replacing every decent chair in the building with something that felt like it was engineered for interrogation rooms. The office morale, already hanging by a lumbar thread, dipped to dangerous levels. Gary's underground chair railroad, once a whisper network of salvation, was quietly shut down. Facilities began rounding up the hidden chairs one by one, wheeling them away under the cover of early morning maintenance windows. There were rumors that Gary tried to fake serial numbers and even disguise one of the chairs as a rolling server rack. His last known stash, which included three chairs and a footrest hidden behind a false wall in the A/V closet, was discovered during an unrelated Wi-Fi upgrade. Gary was never officially reprimanded, but he started bringing his own folding stool to work, and no one asked questions.

Memos poured in. Passive-aggressive emails were replied to with increasingly less passive, more aggressive tones. People muttered about unionizing. And somewhere in Corporate, someone took notice.

The investigation into Phil's fall had been quietly progressing. A senior safety auditor, combing through the absurdly detailed paperwork Dan had filed, flagged the seating policy change as a possible catalyst for increased injury risk. A surprise inspection was ordered.

Before Q3 could arrive, the entire ergonomic conflict reached a critical boiling point. But just as tensions threatened to collapse into full-scale revolt, the corporate surprise inspection arrived unannounced.

Inspectors swept through the office with clipboards and measuring tools, interviewing staff, documenting bruised tailbones and unsupported wrists. Phil, still on medical leave but rapidly becoming a symbol of righteous injury, was cited in the audit as the original catalyst. The auditors, appalled by the stackable chair initiative and the growing list of ergonomic grievances, issued a cease-and-desist on all further implementation of ""The Standard.""

Dan was called into a remote compliance review. His flyers were collected and shredded. The chairs were pulled. And a slow, cautious restoration began.

Just as the office exhaled, a federal workplace grant arrived. By the time Q3 rolled around, everything changed. Sit-stand desks appeared overnight, shipped in cardboard cathedrals and assembled like altars. Gel wrist pads were handed out like candy. Monitor arms extended gracefully from cubicle walls like metallic sunflowers. The transformation was rapid, surreal, and oddly quiet.

Phil recovered.

He returned part-time and received a branded mug that said ""Fall Forward: Safety First.""

He became a symbol, a quiet champion of cause and consequence. By the time he shuffled back in with his toolbox and thermos, the winds of change were already blowing through the office carpet.

The final triumph took shape not with fanfare but in the form of a follow-up compliance roundtable. Tina, armed with an inbox full of citations and ergonomic best practices, made the case for a new normal. Gary, still perched proudly on his folding stool, submitted archived chat logs and floorplans of his hidden chair network. The two of them, the quiet rebel and the strategic hoarder, stood together to present a vision: posture-positive reform, budgeted mesh inventory, and a formal ban on chairs that made violin noises.

Corporate listened. The verdict was swift.

Dan, still nursing the sting of a rescinded flyer campaign and a permanently shelved ten-point plan, was reassigned to digital policy review. He now manages onboarding modules for remote interns, far from the hum of the copy room and the scent of mesh.

A new golden age of ergonomics dawned. There were still meetings, but now they happened at eye level. The breakroom chairs reclined slightly. Wrist pads were embroidered. Someone ordered a foot hammock and no one questioned it. Tina got a plaque etched with the phrase ""Posture is Power."" Gary got his old chair back and wheeled it across the office with a grin that said it all.

Peace, it turned out, could be supported. Just like a well-adjusted spine.

Phil watched it all with quiet pride. His story became legend, his fall a parable whispered in break rooms. He claimed he didn't understand what all the fuss was about. ""All I did was fall off a chair,"" he'd say, sipping lukewarm coffee and watching as the once-fluorescent jungle transformed into a biomechanically optimized Eden.

And maybe that's true.

But history will remember it differently. Because that's how wars begin, not with declarations, but with a wobble, a fall... and a whispered ""This could've been avoided.""

We live in America but went overseas for a vacation. My MIL has a house in America and a house overseas. So she is going to be staying 6 months while we stay one month. She insisted on us going there to not waste money but honestly we were fine wasting money and being comfortable. We didn‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings by having our own place and make her feel like we just don‚Äôt wanna be around her. Well that‚Äôs what my husband thought.. but I just agreed because it‚Äôs temporary. We definitely had our ups and downs as we previously lived with each other. But sooner or later I had convinced my husband to move us out and we are much happier by ourselves. I had so much anxiety after I found out we would be spending the whole vacation living in the same house as them. But honestly it‚Äôs not as bad as I thought. Me and my mother in law are getting along well even though I wake up late because of the jet lag and my 7 month old is having a hard time adjusting as well which my MIL understands! 

The things that are bothering me are just little things like I feel like I cant leave any dishes in the sink she will wash it right away. But when she puts dishes in the sink she leaves them. So I feel guilty and wash every dish right away. (I don‚Äôt only wash mine I wash everyone‚Äôs) She has a lot of things in the room we are staying in so she‚Äôs constantly barging in our room..sometimes knocking and opening without us responding and sometimes just opening our door. She also gets mad if we go out and eat and dont eat from her food. Like she gets mad when we don‚Äôt eat for a few days straight at her house. I guess we have to take breaks and eat at home but I‚Äôm trying to enjoy my vacation and eat out at recommended restaurants. Some days I had to cancel plans because she wanted to make it a cleaning day which is fine I guess but I‚Äôm just frustrated because I had some fun things planned out. It‚Äôs nice to keep things clean but I can do that when I‚Äôm homeeeeee. I haven‚Äôt been able to do anything I wanted to do yet and it‚Äôs been 2 weeks since I‚Äôve been here. Mainly the fault is with my husband because he doesn‚Äôt care if we go out or not. My in laws have invited and uninvited guests coming every single day and I feel like I‚Äôm being rude because I don‚Äôt sit with them and let my mother in law serve them because they aren‚Äôt even my guests. And they are here for her not me. I don‚Äôt even speak their language. I feel like she tried to make me sit with her guests but I kept refusing so she stopped. I had to cancel plans again one day to help mother in law with her guests because she hosted a dinner. It‚Äôs just ridiculous that I hav dti keep canceling my plans üò≠ I know she wants me to wake up early and make her coffee but I don‚Äôt even drink coffee every day in the morning. I just feel like this isn‚Äôt even a vacation anymore and I wanna go back home.. idk if I‚Äôm also being rude by going out and not helping her cook but it‚Äôs because we are going out to eat though. Should I help her anyways? She kindly invited us to her house but I just hate the invasion of privacy and feel like the whole vacation is ruined. Even though she is very sweet.

This morning, in today's stillness of the 24 hours reading of prayer and meditation, a gentle whisper comes: *Accept the limitless and eternal Spirit, you are here to express It.* What a glorious realization! That the Infinite seeks to live through you.

Now, what does that mean in the ordinary world of traffic jams and coffee cups? My dear friend Craig once found out the hard way. After a meeting, another member approached him, a man with the kind of quiet authority that comes from walking many miles with God. 

He asked, ""*Craig, how much power does God have?*""

Craig fumbled, uncertain, sifting through thoughts like a man digging through an attic. But before he could answer, the man interrupted:

**""All of it.""**

And then, fixing Craig with a steady gaze, asked again,

""*And how much does that leave you?*""

Craig hesitated. ""*I don't know,*"" he muttered.

The old timer smiled gently and said,

""**None of it. God has all of it. You have none. That's why you must surrender.**""

There it is, the principle in practice. As We Agnostics says: **Lack of power, that was our dilemma.** And the solution? This AA book is but a path to finding that Power. That‚Äôs ""...*exactly what this book is about. Its
main object is to enable you to find a Power greater than yourself which will solve your problem.*"" 

Well, jump a pig and kick a cow.

**When I surrender, truly let go, things begin to unfold with grace. I no longer fight the world. I meet others as they are, not as I wish them to be.**

Sobriety hasn't made every day sunny, rainbows, unicorns, nor each day a holiday, but I don't wake up in the depth of despair, either. It has made me teachable. Reachable. Lovable. In service and in action, I heal.

Let us walk humbly today, hand in hand with the Infinite. And for that, I am grateful.

**Title: 8 Actually Useful Ways to Style a Brown Leather Sofa (Interior Design Tips)**

**TL;DR:** Brown leather sofas can be tricky to style, but with the right mix of colors, textures, and accessories, they can become a stunning centerpiece. Key elements: balance warm/cool tones, incorporate natural elements, mix textures, and layer lighting strategically.

---

Hey r/HomeDecor! Just put together a comprehensive guide for anyone struggling with decorating around a brown leather sofa. Here are the key strategies that actually work:

**1. Color Balance Is Everything**
* Mix cool tones (blues, greens, grays) with the warm leather
* Use crisp neutrals (ivory, beige) as a base
* Avoid making everything brown - contrast is your friend

**2. Natural Elements Are Your Best Friend**
* Wooden coffee tables with visible grain
* Indoor plants (fiddle-leaf figs, snake plants)
* Natural fiber rugs and accessories

**3. Smart Furniture Pairings**
* Coffee Tables: Go for marble, glass, or wood that complements (not matches) the leather
* Armchairs: Choose contrasting textures (velvet, linen) in complementary colors
* Mix modern and vintage pieces for character

**4. Texture Layering Tips**
* Add plush throws and varied cushions
* Mix materials (knits, velvet, faux fur)
* Use rugs to define spaces and add softness

**5. Lighting Strategy**
* Layer different light sources (floor lamps, table lamps, overhead)
* Use warm bulbs to enhance leather tones
* Consider strategic accent lighting

**Pro Tips:**
* Don't be afraid to mix design styles
* Scale artwork properly to your space
* Use curtains to soften the overall look
* Add plants for life and color

**What Not to Do:**
* Don't make everything brown
* Avoid sterile, clinical vibes
* Don't skimp on lighting layers

Things I can pinpoint that tangibly contributed to this latest meltdown: 

- Got rejected for MBT, had it previously in 2019 and it helped a lot. No explanation given. 

- Had to print off and go over my medical records for PIP review. Seeing the bat shit craziness on paper gave me a sense of hopelessness, shame and self loathing. 

- Had unprotected sex with a past partner 6 weeks ago after 18 months of abstinence. Became paranoid about STI‚Äôs.

- Had quite a bit to drink on an empty stomach at the weekend, I met my parents and aunt/uncle in town for a drink. Got paralytic, became belligerent when told to go home. 

- Couldn‚Äôt find my vape when I got home, this made me feel suicidal. Straw and camels back type situation. Tried to take a paracetamol overdose but I left my front door open and my neighbour heard me scream crying, took pills away and rang ambulance. Very embarrassing. 

Since this I‚Äôve been a bitch of the highest order to get ahead of the curve and push people away before they abandon me. Was supposed to go out to dinner for my birthday today but have been bedrotting with shame for the last 4 days and said I didn‚Äôt feel like it and I‚Äôm sure nobody else feels like celebrating the day I was borne anyway. Parents are done with me so not inclined to try and persuade me. So I‚Äôm just sat in my coffee and Dr Pepper zero stained pyjamas in my crumb ridden bed crying my eyes out. I hate myself on a cellular level and I don‚Äôt want to grow old like this. I‚Äôve been this way since I was 11 years old. 

I have a medication review tomorrow, currently on 30mg mirtazapine and 100mg quietiapine. I think today I will take 600mg and try and knock myself out. What should I say tomorrow? Why do I feel so sad and empty and just wrong? Why do birthdays and christmases always follow along these lines? Why have I ruined my life again. I feel so empty and fundamentally broken. 

ETA I went on a weekend mental health retreat a fortnight ago and was feeling relatively hopeful. How does it go from that to this??? It was a bursary funded place with a charity in Wales. Why do I shit all over myself and ruin anything good. ",9,1750854726.0,BPD,1,1.0,False

Do you want help resolving your issue so you can move on with your day and feel good?

Just. Be. F\*cking. Nice. 

I have worked in customer service/hospitality for 20+ years. I know how it feels when a customer is not happy and takes their anger out on me. I also know how great it feels when I can actually help someone that made a genuine mistake and I can make their day with a few key strokes, a call or me pulling favors behind the scenes.

JUST BE F\*CKING NICE to the people that you encounter who are just trying to help you have a excellent vacation, a good meal, hotel stay, excursion, coffee, car rental or quick trip to Walmart for that forgotten item. 

Ladies and Gentlemen, just be nice. We are all human beings. We make mistakes, booked the wrong date, arrived late, hit traffic or had to wait on long lines. It sucks. But don't take your anger or frustration out on the person in front of you, or on the phone or a chat. Do you want actually want help with your issue? Well, that person has the power to help you, but it all depends how you speak to and treat that other human being.

  
Just be nice and treat people the way you want to be treated, respected and spoken to.

I've never been to USA. As far as I can recall, I've been not watching or reading anything related to Wisconsin. I just know it's a state in USA, I don't even know where Wisconsin is or what it's like. To the north or east, hot or cold, no idea.

But for the past two-three weeks I regularly see Wisconsin in my dreams. Last week, I was hiking and I fell and hit my head to a rock, and broke my arm. Fortunately, a group of MDs were also trekking there and they did the first aid. While they were cleaning my wounds and fastening my arm with splints, I passed out and dreamt of Wisconsin again; I was trying to cook some Turkish coffee in Wisconsin and there were bunch of people all around me, they were yelling at me ""Turkish coffee has to be dark roasted, but your coffee is pretty light"" and I was like ""I know, I know but this is Wisconsin, it's all I got, just give it a try"" and then they beat the shit out of me because it didn't taste good. One of the worst bad trips I've ever had.

So, I'm recovering know and I keep seeing Wisconsin in my dreams. I have no idea know how Wisconsin got into my subconsciousness.  I'm not a religious, superstitious person, I'm not even into mystical stuff. But I did some research on Wisconsin and it seems like a nice place I'd like to live or see once and I'm yearning for it like it was a spiritual sign to find my long lost place in this Earth.

He said the company has 339 claims in an area of southern Montana dubbed¬†[Sheep Creek](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/sheep-creek/)¬†on 10 square miles of land.

‚ÄúThis country can no longer have the Chinese knee on our neck,‚Äù Kaye said. ‚ÄúTherefore we need to work together as a group.‚Äù

Working with INL‚Äôs Robert Fox, there has been the development of technology called an electrochemical membrane reactor.

‚ÄúIt is environmentally conscious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt has the ability to process rare earth elements in an efficient, environmental manner.‚Äù

By year‚Äôs end, the goal is to deliver up to two tons of gallium a day, but it has been an arduous process.

‚ÄúIt has basically taken us 15 years to do nothing,‚Äù he said, but that is slowly changing.

In contrast, the Chinese have taken a different approach.

‚ÄúChina and their government have been extremely supportive to create world dominance,‚Äù he said.

As an example, the only operational rare earth mine in the United States is located in the Mojave Desert in California.

But even the company that owns it ‚Äî¬†[MP Materials](https://mpmaterials.com/mountain-pass)¬†‚Äî is partially owned by China, he said.

‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt be good,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúLet us do what we know how to do.‚Äù

# The Minnesota problem

Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., said the Obama and Biden administrations left a legacy that helped put the United States at a disadvantage.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had an anti-mining political agenda in this nation that is crippling our strategic national security,‚Äù he said.

A 224,000-acre mining parcel had its permits stripped ‚Äî essentially revoked ‚Äî that had been in place since 1966.

Deposits in Minnesota of iron ore made into steel were among the richest in the world in terms of concentration: 82%.

‚ÄúThat helped us win two world wars,‚Äù he emphasized.

China, he said, stopped exporting six of the 17 rare earth elements it controls.

But he said there are some naysayers in Congress who have no desire to mine at all, which goes against the very real need the United States has.

‚ÄúWe can mine in Minnesota, we can mine in Alaska, we can mine in Utah, we can mine in Nevada, we can mine in California, we can mine in Washington and we can mine in Pennsylvania,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have to have the political will to do it.‚Äù

Stauber has reintroduced legislation to overturn a 20-year mining ban near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that was imposed two years ago under the Biden administration.

Stauber has reintroduced legislation to overturn a 20-year mining ban near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that was imposed two years ago under the Biden administration.

The bill would also return two key federal mineral leases to Twin Metals Minnesota, the company vying to build an underground mine for copper and nickel near Ely, Minnesota, on the shore of Birch Lake, just south of the wilderness.

The Biden administration revoked those leases in 2022.

The committee also heard from Aaron Dowd, chief executive officer of Rare Earth Salts, based in Nebraska.

***‚ÄúThe United States faces an unprecedented threat to our economic sovereignty and national security,‚Äù he said.***

***These rare earth elements and critical minerals are key components of multiple products in demand in the nation, including cellphones and batteries for electric vehicles, as well as products used in the health care industry, the manufacture of wind turbines and critical components used by the military, he said.***

‚ÄúToday, China controls 90% of the global downstream rare earth supply chain,‚Äù he said.

Despite this, the United States can unlock the potential to compete if it chooses to, Dowd said.

‚ÄúThe technology is ready and the market need is undeniable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt requires a robust framework. ... This is the oil of 100 years ago.‚Äù

Ken Mushinski, chief executive officer of¬†[Rare Element Resources](https://www.rareelementresources.com/), is leading this company in a rare earth element demonstration processing plant project in Wyoming.

He said the company has thrown more than $100 million into the effort.

***In a statement on the company‚Äôs website, Mushinski stated:***

***‚ÄúThe knowledge gained from the operation of this demonstration plant will be of utmost importance to the progression toward full-scale commercial operations with our unique technology. Understanding the critical need for a secure, domestic rare earth supply chain, the company, with the unanimous backing of its Board of Directors, fully supports this opportunity for potential improvements through this review.‚Äù***

# More on the problem abroad

The company successfully obtained an operation license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission at great cost and time, he said.

***But China, he added, has the ability to flood the market and devalue the material ‚Äî deterring additional investment.***

A critic of the discussion, Rep. Gil Cisneros, D-Calif., said these discussions on critical minerals and rare earth elements have already been heard in multiple other committees.

‚ÄúThis sounds like an infomercial for President (Donald) Trump.‚Äù

# JUNE 25th, 2025~ReElement, Pensana forge rare earth pact

[ReElement, Pensana forge rare earth pact - Metal Tech News](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/06/25/tech-metals/reelement-pensana-forge-rare-earth-pact/2345.html)

https://preview.redd.it/phy5dtyde29f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d564780dfe88a9385645ca7b206669c1e81fdc1a

Through a newly signed agreement, plans are underway to establish one of the largest rare earth oxide supply chains outside China ‚Äì linking Pensana's high-grade Longonjo mine in Angola with ReElement Technologies' advanced refining capabilities in the United States.

Positioned as a cornerstone of a geopolitically resilient supply chain, the partnership being forged under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the companies aims to provide allied industrial and defense sectors with a stable source of rare earth oxides at a time when global concerns over China's dominance in refining and processing continue to intensify.

""Our partnership and MOU with Pensana represents a major advancement toward building a true mine-to-magnet global rare earth supply chain,"" said ReElement Technologies CEO Mark Jensen. ""Securing mineral independence requires innovation, not imitation - and legacy solvent-based refining methods simply won't be competitive or scalable in the modern market. ReElement's multi-mineral refining platform is uniquely positioned to unlock this opportunity with efficiency, flexibility, and global collaboration. We are excited to begin working with Pensana immediately given their vast reserves and production capabilities in Angola, a region that is aligned with US interests in Africa.""

As part of the MOU, Pensana is expected to supply up to 20,000 metric tons per year of ultra-clean mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) to ReElement over a five-year period in a choice offtake agreement.

While pricing details have yet to be finalized, the scale of the agreement signals serious commercial intent and reflects a shared commitment to building a scalable, long-term partnership ‚Äì one that includes exploring additional joint ventures to further strengthen and diversify the rare earth value chain.

The two companies also intend to coordinate closely on logistics and infrastructure planning, particularly in optimizing export routes via the Lobito Corridor, a rapidly modernizing rail and port network that connects Angola's interior to global shipping lanes.

Backed by multilateral development efforts, this strategic gateway offers a cost-efficient path for African critical minerals to reach Western markets ‚Äì positioning the partnership to lower transportation costs, minimize delays, and further distance itself from China-centric rare earth supply chains.

# Advanced U.S. refining capacity

Bringing advanced refining capabilities to the partnership, ReElement operates a U.S.-based platform designed to produce high-purity, magnet- and defense-grade rare earth oxides.

Since the 2023 launch of its commercial facility in Noblesville, Indiana, the company has gained traction through customer validation programs and is now expanding its footprint with a large-scale processing site in Marion.

Favoring a modular, high-throughput system over traditional solvent extraction, ReElement's process produces less waste and offers a more environmentally sustainable solution. Built around a multi-mineral, multi-feedstock approach, the technology can handle everything from recycled materials to mine concentrates like those from Longonjo, and even coal byproducts.

This versatility positions the company to anchor a resilient domestic supply chain that can adapt to shifting demand across the EV, renewable energy, and defense sectors. As Jensen noted, the path to mineral independence lies not in mimicking legacy systems, but in surpassing them with next-generation solutions.

# Scale and sustainability

Among the world's largest and highest-grade deposits of rare earths used in permanent magnets, Pensana's Longonjo project in Angola contains more than 139,000 metric tons of neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, with a projected mine life exceeding 20 years.

Initial production of 20,000 tons of high-quality MREC is slated to commence in the near term, with a second phase planned to double capacity to 40,000 tons per year ‚Äì enough to account for roughly 5% of global supply.

""We're thrilled to begin our collaboration with ReElement,"" said Pensana CEO Tim George. ""Both of our teams share a clear vision for establishing an efficient, scalable, and enduring supply chain for magnet-grade rare earths - critical to meeting the accelerating global demand.""

The company has also distinguished itself through its focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, developing a comprehensive sustainability blueprint, receiving green bond certification from CICERO, and earning a Gold Medal from EcoVadis, placing it among the top 5% of rated companies globally.

This focus on responsible mining could give Pensana an edge in securing contracts with OEMs and governments looking to reduce their supply chain carbon footprints and ESG risks.

# Broader Implications

Reflecting a global drive to secure critical mineral supply chains, this partnership arrives as nations accelerate efforts to build the hardware underpinning the energy transition ‚Äì electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, and advanced defense systems all rely on rare earths for their permanent magnets.

The collaboration also aligns with U.S. strategic initiatives aimed at deepening ties with resource-rich African countries like Angola, offering a credible alternative to mineral supply networks dominated by China.

As the electrification of transport and energy reshapes the global industrial landscape, rare earth elements have shifted from niche to essential. Ensuring access to these foundational materials through reliable, transparent, and geopolitically aligned supply chains will be central to advancing both climate goals and national security priorities.

Whether U.S.-Africa partnerships can deliver on that potential ‚Äì while meeting modern standards of efficiency, sustainability, and shared economic growth ‚Äì now hinges on the outcomes of test cases like this one.

I went there to verify my account from World App just to get that free money the app was offering.

Dahil wala pang work for almost 2 months and walang budget, napagtripan kong patusin yung sinend na link ni tita saken, unang ginawa ko was to verify my ID inside the app, nakakuha ako 900, after nun saktong punta sa lucky china mall to buy myself a coffee.

Then, meron papala another reward  na 1.2k kung saan you need to set an appointment sa app for orb verification.

Noong nakapila ako for orb verification, madami din tao nakapila, waiting for their turn to get verified. The whole time nasa loob ako, naramdaman ko yung awa sa sarili ko, na I stoop this low para sa pera.
