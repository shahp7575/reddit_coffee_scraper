Bo’s Coffee: 
best time to go is during low time at around 2-5pm. Not recommended for work/book reading if daghan na tao since it gets crowded and banha. They have wifi pero dili ka maka connect. Dugay ni sila mag close.

12D Cafe: 
homey! its a small cafe and it’s conducive for work/study since it gets to get filled up by people with laptops/books. Good place and good price. 

Columns Coffee:
best place for catch up with friends. It’s aesthetically pleasing ilang interior pod. If you wanna read, it’s a best place pod pero if mo dghan gyud tao and dili ka maka focus, pag Netflix nalang.

Dear Joe:
holiday vibes. Better compared to coffee project. Holiday vibes, with wifi pod. High price range.

Craft coffee:
Opens early! naay wifi and you can work there too! lots of food options and good place pod.

Second shot:
go-to cafe for work and leisure and naay WiFi. Lami ilang coffee and it’s expected na daghan mo adto. It gets too banha especially if naay mga kaila ang owner/baristas na naga visit after workout. 

Heron cafe: 
expensive compared to second shot and they’re just few walks away. But it’s a place where u can work kay naa sila tables naka linya gyud.

Project brew:
catch-up place. The set-up sa table/chair is not for working long hours. But they have food pop-ups outside and friendly kaayo.

Fulcrum at Watergate:
If need ka mag work late and you happen to visit project brew, tabok nalang. Mas gamay naga tambay diria na mga ante na mag sge katawa. Dugay pod mag close.

Leah’s Cafe:
opens at 7am, with meals and coffee. And it’s for working individuals gyud. All of the tables has outlets and dili sya crowded dili pod banha. Walay mga students or mga tigulang na grupo naga tambay. With wifi. Wfh people seem to be working there often. 

Sas cafe:
best place to laundry and work. Has good food options and no people loitering/lounging. Dili banha, with wifi pod. A lot of people law students study there. 

Paramount:
Catch up place. If you wanna work, naay tables atubangan sa highway na tends to be banha and dali mapuno.

1p57mpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1p57mpb/drift_vs_freeze_in_gpt51_explained_with_coffee/,Drift vs Freeze in GPT-5.1 — explained with coffee and milk,"Yesterday’s experiment showed something simple:  
send the same message 10 times and watch how it changes.

Some models “drift.”  
GPT-5.1 often “freezes.”

Here’s an easy way to see the difference — no technical terms.

---

Drift = adding milk one spoon at a time

Imagine a cup of black coffee.  
Add one spoon of milk after each turn:

• dark  
• slightly lighter  
• lighter  
• eventually a whole different drink  

That’s drift:

• Run1 → perfect  
• Run5 → slightly off  
• Run10 → “who is this?”  

A slow color shift.

---

Freeze (GPT-5.1) = dumping the whole carton in

Instead of one spoon, pour the *entire* milk carton at once.

• it becomes one uniform color  
• everything **blends** instantly  
• and it stays that way  
• you can’t un-blend it  

That’s freeze mode:

• one wrong interpretation  
• everything **blends** into that  
• the model locks onto it  
• answers repeat the same pattern  

Freeze = “incorrect idea → permanent **blend**.”

---

Yesterday’s experiment made this visible

● “3 lines in one block”  
= dumping everything into the cup

→ instructions blend  
→ GPT-5.1 freezes that mixture  
→ reply style becomes locked  
→ every answer looks the same  

---

● “A / B / C split”  
= adding ingredients separately

→ nothing blends  
→ instructions stay clear  
→ replies stay consistent  

---

#
In short:
• Mixed instructions → drift (slow change) or freeze (locked change)  
• Separated instructions → stable behavior  

Different outcomes, same root cause:  
**everything blends when all instructions live in one block.**

---

Hey ladies 👋

I’m a single dad to two awesome kids, and I’m finally ready to find my person. I’m looking for a godly woman I can love fiercely, cherish deeply, and build a lifetime of new memories with. Someone who wants real commitment, not games.

About me: •	Total dork at heart ❤️ I live for Disney trips, Universal days, arcade nights, and beating everyone at air hockey •	Goofy, affectionate, and will 100% make you laugh until you can’t breathe •	Love cozy coffee dates, deep conversations, and spontaneous adventures •	Big on faith, family, and showing up fully for the people I love Looking for: •	A woman who loves Jesus and wants to grow together in faith •	Someone who’s kind, fun, and doesn’t mind a man who’s all-in and a little silly •	Bonus if you like theme parks, Marvel movies, or can destroy me at Mario Kart 😏

I’m in the Inland Empire (Riverside/San Bernardino area). If you’re seriously looking for something real and think we might click, shoot me a DM! I’ve got Discord or Instagram too if that’s easier to chat on. No hookups, no endless chatting looking for my future wife to do life with

I would like to get married eventually. I would not like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.  I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. All 3 of them not just 2. Also I want to have children this is a requirement. Also please make an effort when messaging me. By effort I I mean at least 1 sentence, not 1 word. Physical attraction is much more important to me than personality. Also I am currently living in a group home for now due to being disabled. If you can’t handle those things don’t message me. Also please don’t expect me to work from home. I much prefer working at a workplace rather than staying at home all day.

Met this ridiculously gorgeous girl outside the Safeway on Commercial. She had that kind of smile that hits you in the chest, plus an accent that made me forget what I was even saying. We talked for a bit , she mentioned she works in IT and honestly sounded way smarter than me. I was right about to ask for her number, then her Uber showed up and the moment was gone. Realizing I didn’t ask has been haunting me harder than it should.

What stuck with me:

Kind of tall, darker skin, couldn’t figure out her ethnicity but she looked insane

Thicker body, in the best possible way 

Said she gets her hiking recommendations from this subreddit, so I know she’s lurking here somewhere

Chest tattoos, and I think a piercing, caught it for a second.

And her smile… bro, she smiles with her eyes. It’s a whole thing.


If you see this, seriously.. reach out. Haven’t been able to get you out of my head since, and it’d be cool to actually finish that conversation. Coffee at the Starbucks in Safeway?",12,1763958061.0,askvan,1,0.88,False

Hi 👋🏼 maybe you’re like me and having a hard time sleeping. Let’s talk before dozing off. Starting with friends and open to something more if that transpires. 

Here is a bit about me: I like travelling, reading, painting, binging shows, music and baking from time to time. In terms of personality, I’m easy going, a curious person by nature, grounded, can hold a conversation. I like cats. Fireworks. Brownies. A hot cup of coffee on a cold morning. Board games. I read a lot of non-fiction but lately have been thinking I should delve into some fiction. 

I would like to meet someone respectful, kind, good communication, consistent, good career, age-appropriate 34/35+, funny, cute, good banter skills and single. I’ve been in situationship and not trying to get into another one so someone emotionally available would be great. I’m in Canada EST in case you need a time zone.

A coffee?!!! let alone lunch for doing your chores. I feel like we deserve the 20% mandatory tip like some restaurants do. we are literally doing what you don’t want to do and you show us an appreciation of a 50% off a slice of pizza coupon bc your tip couldn’t even cover the whole slice. 

I attached below a ridiculous order I saw today. 103 miles just to get there. $6 Tip. 4 bottles of alcohol on the order mind you. Fomf. I don’t understand how you can’t grasp your tip is insulting.

I was diagnosed with ADHD about 4 years ago. Got started on Adderall XR and it has made a massive positive impact on my life.  All gravy on that front.

What has been getting worse lately is my sleep.  More and more I have found that I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, with the only thing seems to help with a cup of 2 of coffee.  I like coffee, but in the middle of the night making and drink 2 cups can take an hour or so, and sometimes it leaves me a sour stomach.  

So far, I haven't tried making coffee a part of my night time routine, mainly because I'm concerned it will grow into me NEEDING the coffee to fall asleep.

So, I'm looking for any tips, tricks, or even anecdotes about how others have dealt with this.

I did everything I was supposed to like a good Mormon would - go to church, serve a mission, go to the temple, magnify callings, etc. etc. For a long time the next step has been temple marriage, but at some point I just gave up on dating altogether. 

I dealt with suicidal thoughts for so long - I believed dying would be better for me than acting on my attractions and that god would prefer it that way. I finally made the decision to be done with the church in January of this year. It was so freeing for a while but reality started to set in - I would have to tell my family and friends that I'm gay. I can't do that.

I went on some dates with some guys and stuff but I'm too afraid sex or anything serious like that will come with intense regrets/depression again. I don't wear my garments,  I drink coffee, etc. but making a real commitment to telling people is not working. One friend has known for a long time who I reached out to while I was struggling mentally, and I've told one other friend but past that I just can't do it. I'm terrified of people knowing even though I know they won't care.

My family is very Mormon still, but I have a gay brother and he's well accepted at this point - he's even married. I know my family would be so disappointed. My dad has repeatedly shared things about being sad certain people have left the church, or not understanding how someone with 'more light' after going through the temple could leave. I've even challenged him on those comments and he sticks to it. I lie to my parents all the time about my ward and going to church, I wear my garments when visiting family, I drink coffee in secret (I live far away from them outside Utah now). It feels gross to be hiding so much like this. I just know how it will hurt my family/parents. I have nieces/nephews I am very close with who won't understand me leaving at this point (they're teenagers and have struggled understanding my brother).

I guess the point is I can't get myself to truly commit even though there's basically no way I could go back at this point. How do I commit? How do I tell my family? When does leaving the church get easier?

I am doing a 2 stage filtration process.  2-3 layers of cheesecloth over a fine mesh strainer then take the cheesecloth filtered punch and put it through a #4 coffee filter for a final pass.

I read don’t disturb it and don’t change the filters to speed up the process.  Be patient, this might take 12 hours.  

My issue is that it clogs up the filters to the point of non functioning.  

1.  How much volume can you get through a typical setup before it clogs up?
2.  Any tricks you use?

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 29 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would not like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.  I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. All 3 of them not just 2. Also please make an effort when messaging me. By effort I I mean at least 1 sentence, not 1 word. Physical attraction is much more important to me than personality. Also I am currently living in a group home for now due to being disabled. If you can’t handle those things don’t message me. Also please don’t expect me to work from home. I much prefer working at a workplace rather than staying at home all day. I am looking for guys aged 18-28. I am looking for white guys, light skinned Hispanics, and light skinned Asians. Finally, I don’t want kids.

1p57bm2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p57bm2,Recap of Our Paris Hotel Stays,"My family and I just returned from our stay in Paris, and due to the way our itinerary played out, we actually ended up staying at several different hotels throughout the trip. Jotting thoughts down here for ourselves and for the group! Note that pricing listed is what we paid per night but would obviously change based on time of year. Prices were likely also high for us because we were either a group of 3 or 4 adults and I typically booked the refundable rates for the rooms. Many hotels were also not an option for us given the occupancy limits. Happy to answer any questions!

**DAY 1**: Residence Nell Paris (4-Star Hotel located in the 9th Arrondissement) - ★★✬☆☆ (Photos 1-5)

>**Google Rating**: 4.3 / **Michelin Guide**: 18.8

>**Cost**: \~$450 for room accommodating 4 adults

>The lobby of the hotel has a very cozy / homey feeling, and the people working at the hotel were very friendly.

>The apartment that we were checked into looked lovely at first glance. It was a 1-bedroom apartment with a sofa bed in the living room to accommodate our party of four. However, I later found a review specifically for this apartment on Google (a one-star review 😫), and despite the review having been written a year prior, most of the issues the reviewer raised were still present.

>Personally, the biggest issues were the bathroom and the noise. Because of the way the shower is designed, the water struggles to drain fast enough and just ends up everywhere. In addition, the window in the shower doesn't seem to be able to close properly, and so there's a draft that comes through, making it quite chilly. The area is also lively in the evenings and there was zero sound insulation so any noise from the streets could easily be heard. Oh, I forgot - there were also two small blood stains that I found on one of the outside sheets.

>Because the hotel is quite small, we didn't ask to store our luggage after check-out and kept it at the lockers at Gare du Nord instead.

>**Would we return?** No. The issues were enough that it wouldn't be on the top of my list to re-book a stay here. Not sure if all of the apartments have the same issues or if it just happens to be this one.

**DAY 2**: Hilton Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (4-Star Hotel located by CDG Airport) - ★★★✬☆ (Photos 6-7)

>**Google Rating**: 3.9 / **Michelin Guide**: N/A

>**Cost**: 60,000 Hilton points for room accommodating 3 adults (booked when AMEX had a 20% transfer bonus)

>We had a 6:50 AM flight from Paris (CDG) to Rome, so we opted to find a hotel by the airport rather than travel in from the city center in the middle of the night. The room was quite spacious and soundproof, though it was nothing special. We were given two twin beds plus a twin sofa bed. However, given that we really just needed a place to sleep for the night, it was perfectly fine for that purpose. It's super easy to access the CDGVAL from the hotel, making it very convenient to get to any of the airport terminals.

>**Would we return?** Maybe. I booked this hotel in particular because I had points to spare, but if I just needed a hotel by the airport, any of the options with easy access to the CDGVAL would be just fine and I would opt to go for whichever one were the cheapest.

**DAY 3**: Hotel Adèle & Jules (4-Star Hotel located in the 9th Arrondissement) - ★★★★✬ (Photos 8-10)

>**Google Rating**: 4.7 / **Michelin Guide**: 19.1

>**Cost**: \~€425 ($490) for room accommodating 3 adults

>After we returned from Rome, we booked a stay here in the Club Boulevard room. Though the room itself was quite small (there was very little walking room once the sofa bed was pulled out), it was very charming and we even had our own balcony where we could sit and enjoy our breakfast. The slippers here were also the comfiest out of all the hotels that I stayed at on this trip! The location was convenient, and because the window faced the courtyard, it was very quiet.

>**Would we return?** Yes. Of all the Paris hotels, I thought this one was the most special and could understand the high ratings that it received.

**DAY 4**: Courtyard by Marriott Paris Gare de Lyon (4-Star Hotel located in the 12th Arrondissement) - ★★★★☆ (Photos 11-12)

>**Google Rating**: 4.4 / **Michelin Guide**: N/A

>**Cost**: \~$425 for room accommodating 4 adults

>Moved hotels again for convenience to Gare de Lyon for our early 7 AM train. The room was also very standard (one king bed + one sofa bed) and had everything we needed for the evening. As I have Marriott status through my AMEX card, we received complimentary welcome drinks at the bar for each of us, which was a nice touch. Similar to the airport hotel, it was nothing extremely memorable, but good for the convenience.

>**Would we return?** Only if I had reason to be near Gare de Lyon.

**DAY 5**: Moxy Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (3-Star Hotel located by CDG) - ★★★✬☆ (Forgot to take photos)

>**Google Rating**: 4.0 / **Michelin Guide**: N/A

>**Cost**: \~$225 for room accommodating 4 adults

>After we returned from Lyon, we ended up back near CDG because of our flight the next morning back to the U.S. I think I chose this one since it was much more affordable than the Hilton and was closer to Terminal 1.

>We received coupons for welcome cocktails here as well, but we ended up requesting to use them on bottles of water from their convenience store section since there was no water in the room. The coffee machine in the lobby was also advertised to us to be 24/7, but it was broken.

>The room itself was quite large, and because it was a family room, it was more similar to a suite with the sofa bed being out in the living room and the king bed being in the bedroom.

>**Would we return?** Maybe. Similar to my thoughts on the Hilton, I would probably look to whichever airport hotel had the best rates available as I'm really just needing a place to sleep.

It has a tiny rotating white line on a dark background which attracted my cat like a laser pointer. Before I realized what was happening, he had jumped up on the tv table and batted/scratched at the screen several times, even standing up on hind legs so I was afraid he might knock it over and hurt himself (and the tv, which also matters, but he’s the more precious of the two ;). 

Unfortunately, I realized later this seems to have caused permanent marks on the screen, which seem to be only on the anti-reflection coating luckily and are only visible when the TV is off but still a bummer because it’s a new TV.

I was surprised to see this clock screensaver because I hadn’t seen it at first when I set up the TV initially. It took me a long time to figure out it started appearing more because I was playing with settings and randomly toggled off the screen saver setting option that says “screen saver promotion”, thinking it was turning off seeing more ads. But turning off this setting meant I turned off the screen saver images I had been seeing originally, which were of cozy scenes like libraries and coffee shops, that only show a tiny branding that says “stingray cozy cafe” or “stingray stargazer” showing images of space. Very unobtrusive and definitely not a problem for me as it’s not intrusive ad. These images don’t attract my cat at all so if/when they appear it prevents the clock from showing up.

BUT - after getting excited that I had found the solution, I then realized that it only seems to work when the TV goes to sleep while I’m on the LG homepage, when I’m in an app like Netflix, prime, etc. and the TV goes to sleep it still triggers the cat attracting clock of doom (ugh).

I’m posting this in case it helps someone who may be having a similar situation - either with the cat, or if you’re just trying to figure out if there is a nicer screensaver for this high-end TV than the rudimentary clock setting that looks like it’s from the year 2000 (the answer is no). I’m hoping maybe LG will do some sort of upgrade in the future but for now we’re stuck with the clock.

Below are my tips for any cat owners out there that have a similar problem (some also apply for anyone who doesn’t like the clock):
1 - toggle on the screen saver setting to allow screen saver promotion - so at least you’re protected when you’re on the Home Screen
2 - increase the time setting for when the screensaver enables. I think the default may be three minutes, I set mine to 10 just so it’s less often going into screensaver mode.
3 - I just ordered some plastic scat mats from Amazon to put on the TV table and help deter my cat from being interested in jumping up there - I don’t know for sure yet how these will work but it’s worth a try
4 - try not to fall asleep with the TV on like I do all the time lol

Good luck to all you cat owners out there! And good luck to any others who were hoping for/expecting a nicer screensaver for this high end tv. If anyone has discovered something else I’m missing, please feel free to share in the comments! Cheers ",1,1763957340.0,LGOLED,0,1.0,False

 It’s on a coffee table (can’t see here), there’s a small gap btw it and the wall, and a long baseboard heater on the floor below it. It turned on last week, I forgot to pull the plant forward, and lost a few nice long leaves (red arrow area). I can’t move the plant, rest of room is full, but have those plastic lids leaning against the wall for now blocking heat.

The left stalk (blue arrow) was always was bushier, now the plant looks even more imbalanced, so I was going to trim some left-side leaves. (The actual balance is fine, it’s not falling over—not even weighty as it looks—it would just be for visual purposes.)

Besides this group, I use ChatGPT Plant Guru for houseplant guidance, its usually very on point. I asked it about cutting leaves, and it keeps telling me that trimming leaves is extremely bad for this kind of plant, and its time to just lop the top off of both and use them as cuttings. Which is crazy. I included its generated pic of what its telling me to do.

Yes, I know, blue arrow side is growing all wonky, though I do flip the whole thing around every watering (It was already on that stretched grow path when I got it though.) Light source is directly to the left, out of frame, a big long northern facing window. As you’ll see, the top leaves are still very active.

Anyhow, looking for thoughts on cutting leaves on the left, and maybe cutting two or so on the bottom of the right side, to reduce the visual of that big gap (red arrow). Is this as terrible as GPT says? Or do I just roll with it and keep lovin' it as-is?

Either way, love the shape, not going to follow the GPT nonsense and behead it.

We don't actually have farms around us, and somehow we have mounds of pumpkins, large ￼hay barrels, and scarecrows set up in October every autumn they often say it's all done in one night ￼. Every time I ask someone who puts up these things, they always answer the same thing: he needs it, and there's a way to harvest ￼ it for him ￼. Must understand that while the majority of people don't actually do this, those who do have a trait: they are all descended from the great land of ￼ Ireland ￼ ￼￼. They all do this for whatever reason.
The men are frequently dressed in elegant dark suits. Solid-colored shoes and shirts, as well as broad-brimmed black or straw hats. The woman was dressed in long-sleeved, full-skirted gowns in solid colours. This may sound bizarre, but it's made much stranger by the masks they're wearing. The women frequently wear masks that resemble pumpkins, birds, or other plant-related objects like flowers. Males are an exception; they frequently grow animals or wear scarecrow masks. I'll work on it. The area surrounding the main square was not being put up. My dad told me that things have always been like way since he was a child. To the man who frequently provides them with alcohol following the festival in the bar ￼onion pig. Indeed, they are quite typical. We have to offer them straws to drink inside the masks since they don't take them off very often, which is simply strange. It's a little unsettling. That is insignificant. They were carried out about 152 years ago after a group of English and Irish people moved and blighted it, according to my library study, and something is intriguing. The Harvest Festival, the Unknown, and Fool's Day were two distinct celebrations. It seems that they both merged years later. We're in the midst of the town, surrounded by wonderful people, with my large black sweatshirt covering the scarecrow mask I constructed months earlier. The Great Harvest Festival began as they were all standing there, talking or getting excited. Thirty-two of the ladies had the same clothes, but their faces were hidden by long black hair. They also frequently had animal skulls, such as those of wolves or deer, and just one had lambs. The women are arranged in a circle, and there are sixteen men in the colours black, red, blue, and white. Wearing a jester or ruff collar and covered in bells. Donning a mask of pure white. The man approached people, held their hands, and placed chunks of chocolate gold between them—often offering them to children—while the women danced and hopped along the street. The women are reaching into the pockets of their skirts and tossing raisins, withered dry plums, flower fragments, and occasionally beads. ""The sun is down, but that doesn't mean the warmth is gone,"" the woman repeated. The speaker goes on to add that growth is coming to an end and that in order to taste it, we must scrape our hands of the dirt. They are all gathered around a huge parade float. The hay barrow was filled with dead little trees. Candles are adorning pumpkins from every aspect. That is frequently illuminated. Autumn foliage adorned the area.
There is the harvest monarch, who appears to be composed of hay, and everything else builds up like a small mountain with a chair. Being a taller boy wearing long trousers that are frequently caught in the bottom, gloves and sleeves, with black fabric covering his neck to the side of his shoulder. His pumpkin head, which is blazing like a decaying plant and is about to burst into pieces, is the major feature that stands out. It appears to be building up in the man's face. He seemed bored in his chair.
The bubbling squash declared, ""It's natural that there are no flames in autumn."" The object keeps moving towards the food until it reaches a huge pyramid-shaped pile of logs, sticks, and leaves. ""Time,"" the Harvest King yelled, raising his fists. It's time to start, everyone. Evelyn repeatedly yelled, ""Begin."" The big king staggered in the direction of this wooden mound of rubbish. Flames started when he threw his crown into the centre of the pile and yanked it up, dividing the flames. ""No sun doesn't mean no heat ￼,"" they go on. Black haze enveloped a young, attractive man. He walked back up to his tower, his face filthy. ""No sun doesn't mean no heat,"" the 32 ladies and the 16 men said while holding hands around the flames. For now, the wood 'burns' for him; the harvest will return. The fog obscured the ongoing movement down the street. After grabbing wood and starting a fire near the enormous bonfire, some people moved in the direction of the tower and vanished into the mist. The lady of the lamb mask told me there was no need to observe what constantly occurs, so she stopped me from coming. A face was carved out of the skull. For your own sake, don't; you'll figure it out eventually. They returned two hours later without the harvest king and the tower. As if nothing had happened, everyone emerged from the fog, returned home, visited bars, and went to dine. However, it doesn't end. Every time, 16 men and 32 women returned to the harvest. However, the king has never returned, always being replaced by a different guy who vanishes at the conclusion of the celebration. As I previously stated, the Irish were printed using a combination of two traditions. I didn't go into great detail about the other festival, but the harvest festival was a straightforward celebration of the harvest with a huge fire. The festival of fools. The celebrations of the idiots appear to be a custom to expel individuals from the community because they are untrustworthy, too difficult to maintain, or have disrupted the system. The idiot is shoved out of town while wearing a mask, and he frequently gets stones and other objects hurled at him to tell him to ""go away,"" but something is missing. How did this come together? And I found it in a haphazard notebook from a century ago that chronicles the early years of the Irish immigration to our area. When the festival arrived, they expelled a local alcoholic who was ruining relations between the newcomers and the original residents of the town.
He burned the village's crops as retaliation because he was upset about this. Because of what he did, he was burned at the stake. Before ￼Everything came together tried to escape from the burning and they saw them attempting to flee while dressed as the Harvest King. This event unites both traditions. However, right now. This indicates that those young guys have been sacrificed for ages. I should report this, but how can I do so if I don't have a body or the bloody goddamn evidence to support it? The next day, everything is gone. There's not a single piece of hay left. I spent five days travelling in search of it, but I found nothing no ash and no remains ￼. Nobody discusses it after autumn; when I enquire, they consistently respond that it's not the season and that discussing it is pointless. The point that needs to be addressed is not only who those young guys are, but also why the municipality as a whole permits this to go on. And that woman wearing the lamb mask—who the hell is she?

I don't know whether he saw me, and my friend has a comically bad poker face so who knows if he noticed that - but as soon as I realized who it was, I felt like someone had grabbed my heart and squeezed.

Sweet Jazz City: the gleaming jewel of Taiga Country. But recent events such as the late night theft of the Arsene Amulet from Sweet Jazz Museum last week has left the city's trust in its police force has been called into question...

""Can you believe this, Typeset? I mean we got the thing back and even managed to arrest a whole group of Banzai Blasters, including their Vice Principals, in the process.""
The man spoke, outraged by the frontpage story of his newspaper. He was an older man, with a thick but short burgundy beard; balding on top, which he did his best to hide with a combover. His skin was as white as anyone born in Taiga Country, that being a light beige colour.
He looked across the desk, over at the woman he was talking to, her nose firmly in a book, ""Typeset!""

The woman known as ‘Typeset’ lifted her head, finally realising she was being talked to, ""hmmmm? Oh sorry, I just figured out what a 10-letter word for an Australian woodwind instrument was...""
Her ashen skin was illuminated by the light coming through the blinds of the police station windows as her fluffy white hair bounced when she moved. ‘Sheepish’ was the best way to describe her in all but her personality as she was anything but shy. ""...What were you talking about, Bronzon?""

""The paper, Arial, come on. Have you not listened to a word I've said?""
Bronzon smacked the newspaper he was reading with his free hand, exaggerating his aggravation over the headline and his fellow officer who clearly hadn't even been listening.

""Nope, Meryl gave me a book of 1,000 crosswords this morning, I've only gotten halfway through it.""

""Halfway? But you only got to work two hours ago! How have you already done 500 crosswords?!""

""Perks of my epithet, I guess,"" she seemingly finished up the crossword she was on as she flipped over to the next page.

""Right, your epithet. What does it do again? It lets you make stuff, right?”

“Not exactly, I can transform anything I've touched recently by changing a letter in its spelling, for example…” Arial would stand up, placing her crossword book under her arm and approach Bronzon, placing a single finger on his newspaper.
PAPER → CAPER
Suddenly, Bronzon’s newspaper disappeared and what was left was a single caper: a pickled Capparis flower bud.

Bronzon was exasperated with epithet shenanigans, “I was reading that.”

“Oh, sorry” This time, Arial didn't even need to touch it as she reversed the effect; CAPER → PAPER

Bronzon, unamused, decided to inform Arial about her duty as was his job. “Well, regardless, don't bother starting a new crossword because you've got patrol today.""

Arial nodded and proceeded to leave the precinct, hopping in a patrol car.
She checked her mirrors before turning on the car and pulling out onto the road. She spent the next few hours just driving around, listening to radio chatter for anything nearby but it was a quiet day today.
At lunch, she stopped at a coffee shop with a heavy jacket on, as it was quite cold today as she ordered her usual: a venti triple pressed iced caramel macchiato latte with oat milk and almond milk, extra caramel drizzle, 4 pumps vanilla, 2 scoops brown sugar, whipped cream, light ice, no foam, double blended and sprinkles; something so sugary that it's actually 110% sugar.
Regardless, Arial happily risked type-2 diabetes as she drank it.

And that's when someone came into the coffee shop yelling, “Everyone on the ground, this is a robbery!”
Arial did what they said, but only so she could see the culprit, or more specifically three culprits. They were all wearing bright yellow jumpsuits with matching helmets: Bonzai Blasters. Did they really not see the police car outside? Her uniform was obscured by her jacket, so these hoodlums hadn't realised their mistake just yet.
They approached the counter, holding up the cashier with their peashooters. “Everything in the register and no one has to get hurt.”
The poor girl complied, handing them a single twenty dollar note.
The blasters looked down at it and immediately raised their voices in a mix of confusion and anger, “hey, we said everything in the register!”

“That is everything!”

“What?”

“Barely anyone uses cash anymore, I think that twenty has been in the register all week.”

“Oh…then we'll take some drinks to go”
The banzai blaster turns to his comrades, “what do you guys want?”

While the three of them thought about their drink orders, Arial was putting together a plan. It was one big puzzle, and if there's one thing she knew how to do, it was solve puzzles.
She emptied her pockets for what she could use: her favourite pen, notepad, her stun gun, a pair of eraser cuffs, and $2.45 in coins.
Even if she did confront them directly, she was outnumbered. Calling for help was also out of the question as it could draw attention to her. With a rush of possibilities, a plan was formed.
She quickly tossed her pen and with her epithet it transformed; PEN → HEN. Where there was once a pen, a chicken landed where it should've clattered to the ground. The Banzai Blasters’ attention was immediately drawn to it, “wait, is that a chicken? Why is there a chicken?!”
Perfect, they were distracted, Arial tossed her loose change at the banzai blasters and transformed it; COINS → COILS. Suddenly, the blasters were covered in loose coils of wire, even more confused, and that's when Arial drew her stun gun and fired. Thanks to the wire, they were all in contact with each other and were knocked out from the high, non-lethal damage.
With her free hand, she pulled back her jacket to reveal her uniform and badge, “Sweet Jazz Police, you're all under arrest for attempted robbery”

With some spare eraser cuffs in her patrol car, she secured the culprits to a bike rack outside who could only moan and complain, “we didn't even get our drinks…”

Arial eventually caught the hen and with a quick swapping of letters, she regained her favourite pen and transformed the wire back into her loose change, pocketing both while she finished her drink and waited for backup.",2,1763955897.0,Epithet_Erased,0,1.0,False

1p56pfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1p56pfl/my_favorite_perfume_house_released_their_yule/,"My Favorite Perfume House Released Their Yule Lineup and There are a Bunch of Gourmands (Also Winnie the Pooh fragrances, Lavender Gourmands, Coffee Fragrances, Pomegranate Fragrances, Lotions, Hair Glosses, Room Sprays, and more!)","# General Overview

I'm not affiliated with BPAL in anyway, but I'm a huge fan of theirs.   
  
BPAL is my favorite perfume house by far. They're a really great indie house that offers fantastic fragrances, supports a lot of great causes and charities, and has great customer service. 

This year's Yule releases don't really appeal to me besides a few things, but I know a lot of people in this subreddit love gourmands, so I thought I could kill two birds with one stone (sharing my favorite perfume house and making people aware of some more unique gourmands) by posting a list of this year's Yule releases. 

Every year, BPAL offers a few returning Yule fragrances, a collection of simple (as in pomegranate and some other accord) pomegranate fragrances, and a collection of lavender gourmands. This year they're offering fragrances inspired by the Hundred-Acre Wood, officially licensed Edward Gorey fragrances, coffee fragrances, and more. Along with fragrances, also has some hair glosses, hair perfumes that have insane longevity (over 12 hours) and help tame frizz and make your hair look shiny, lotions, atmosphere sprays AKA room sprays (home and linen sprays), and beard oils.

If you want to sample them, your best bets are Ajevie, Arae Decantery, the BPAL forums where users are happy to offer decants, the IndieExchange subreddit, and the indiemakeupandmore subreddit's Sunday sale and swap posts. BPAL keeps their seasonal and limited edition fragrances available for a long time. As an example, they took 2024's Yule releases down in July 2025. 

I've taken the descriptions of the fragrances directly from BPAL's website, and fragrances with NSFW label art will have NSFW next to their name. I've separated the fragrances by the collection they're listed under. 

Also, BPAL is a house that really benefits from resting. Resting is very much a thing for ndie perfumers like BPAL, because some indie perfume houses blend fragrances per order and indie perfume houses don't have access to a lot of storage space, so they can't spare space to just let fragrances rest.

Anyone else wake up some days feeling like the Tin Man before Dorothy oiled him up? 😅 I know I do! We hit 50 (or breeze past it!), and suddenly everything creaks and groans a little louder.

Stretching... yeah, we all *know* we should. But honestly, spending 30 minutes contorting myself into pretzel shapes before I've even had my coffee? Nah. Plus, sometimes it just doesn't really *help* that much, does it?

So, what's a creaky, retirement-bound buddy to do?

I stumbled upon something that's been a game-changer for me, and I HAD to share it. It's all about **mobility exercises**! Now, before you click away thinking ""more exercises?!"" hear me out.

Think of it less like ""exercise"" and more like ""unlocking"" your body. It's about improving your range of motion and getting your joints moving *naturally*.

Here’s the cool part:

*   **It's quick!** You can do these movements in 5-10 minutes. Seriously.
*   **No fancy equipment needed.** Your bodyweight is enough.
*   **Feels GOOD!** Unlike forced stretching, mobility exercises often bring immediate relief.

Here's a few things I've been loving lately:

*   **Arm Circles:** Simple, but mighty! Small circles forward, then backward. Feel the shoulders open up.
*   **Cat-Cow:** On your hands and knees, arch your back like a cat, then dip it like a cow. This is SO good for the spine.
*   **Leg Swings:** Holding onto a chair (or counter!), swing one leg forward and back, then side to side. Hello, hip flexors!

I was chatting with my neighbor, Brenda, the other day (you know, the one who runs marathons in her spare time? Yeah, that Brenda!), and she was complaining about knee stiffness. She's been stretching for ages! I told her about mobility work, and she tried some simple leg swings. Next time I saw her, she was raving about how much better her knees felt! Seriously, sometimes the simplest things are the most effective.

1、Loosen your grip on the bars. You need enough to steer the bike, not choke the chicken. It’s going to lessen the possibility of the dreaded “tank slapper.” If you can’t flap your arms, you’re holding on too tight. Practice this in the straights. It will let you know exactly how much pressure you need to apply. Learn that feel. Intimately. Road imperfections and bumps won’t be nearly as jarring once you do.

**2、Non-latex gloves**. Throw a couple pairs in your pocket. You’ll barely notice them, but if it gets cold(er) during your ride, they’ll give at least 10–15 degrees of warmth to make it to where you’re going without numb fingers. (It’s also a much better solution that putting your hands on your exhaust pipe. *Yes, that will work in a pinch, but it also shortens the lifespan of your gloves and good ones aren’t cheap.*)

3、If you’re going to pass a semi/bus/large vehicle, wave a hand into the lane you plan to switch over into…it’s not much, but they’ll appreciate it and give you the requisite space to get your boogie on. This helps in two ways—one, it helps to let them know where you intend to go, and it also lets you know that if you are *unable to do so*—don’t. They can’t stop half as fast as you can. If you don’t have time to perform this simple maneuver, don’t change lanes. You’ve been warned.

4、Carry a small repair kit. Don’t bring the entire garage, but just enough to tweak what you need to if trouble strikes.

5、Rain gear. Carry it, and at a minimum, rain pants. Rain sucks. Riding wet **and** cold is particularly miserable. If you’re wearing gear it’s at least water resistant. Leather works unless it’s a straight downpour. Again, I’m talking a few ounces of extra weight here and not much bulk.

6、Murdered out (all black) looks cool, but *try* make sure that you’re visible at all times. Whether you do that with colors that pop, reflective piping, strips, whatever. Make sure people **see** you. *I guarantee they’re not paying attention either way*, so the best bet for you is to make sure they do.

7、If filtering (moving to the front of traffic at a stop) is an available option, **do it**. It’s just a little more protection against someone slamming into the back of your bike.

8、Use your rear brake in slow-moving traffic. Yeah, I know they told you to do that in your MSF class (you **did** take it, *right*???) but it works wonders in stop-and-go/city traffic. Learn how to feather that rear brake and you’ll be glad you did. It even works on bikes that don’t have rider aids.

9、If you’re tired. Stop. Just stop. Grab a cup of coffee. Warm up (or cool off), relax, whatever you need to do. Drivers can afford (not really) a second or two of inattention, you cannot. Make it safely.

10、If you’re going to ride around with your visor up, know that insects will fly into your helmet. It’s definitely a thing. Be prepared.",9,1763955109.0,NewRiders,4,0.81,False
1p56k04,https://v.redd.it/nrxiav16k43g1,Day 3 of our first-ever iSUP expedition around Isla Espíritu Santo and Isla Partida — and today we got to meet the sea lions!,"Day 3 — La Playa Embudo

Day Three started the same way as always — early morning, before sunrise. We were still on the west side of Isla Partida, facing open deep water. With an early sip of instant coffee and our gear assembled, we were ready to depart.

The water was like glass — nothing like what Windy App had predicted. No strong winds, just calm, peaceful silence.

We started moving forward, switching formations from time to time. Turn after turn, the island revealed its architectural masterpiece carved over millions of years by wind and waves. Beautiful caves opened up around us, and then we saw it — the arch.

Alex had told me before the journey: “Once you find the arch and pass under it, make a wish.”

And there it was.

We approached slowly, inspecting the surroundings, careful not to cut the inflatable boards on hidden rocks. One by one, we passed under the arch — a majestic natural structure shaped by time itself. And even though the island had already given me so much, I made my wish: to be at peace with myself.

We continued, jumping into the deep blue from time to time. The beauty above the water was only the tip of an ancient mountain plunging into unlimited depth, filled with its own marine life.

We rounded the next corner, and about 500 meters ahead a small rocky islet appeared — the sea lion sanctuary. One of the largest thriving colonies in the area. We couldn’t skip it. Seeing them in their natural habitat was one of the key goals of the entire expedition.

As we approached, we saw several guided tour boats already attached to the designated buoys. One had just dropped off a small group. We asked permission to tie our boards to one of the buoys and requested to join the guide to observe the sea lions respectfully. Permission granted.

We put on our gear and dropped into the water. The wind was fresh but manageable. A big male lay on the rocks — we knew not to disturb him. Exploring the area, we found a deep, dark cave carved into one of the rocks. We entered slowly. Inside, it opened into a world of pure harmony — young sea lions, playful and curious, moving like puppies in a dance of pure joy. It was unforgettable.

After spending some time with them, we thanked the boat captain and continued toward our next campsite: Playa Embudo.

Moving forward, we passed another sea lion colony. This one wasn’t friendly. The larger ones made it clear: keep your distance. Waves were stronger now.

Then Armando lost his balance and fell into the water. His leash got tangled around the fin, making it almost impossible for him to get back on the board. He kept trying and failing.

At the same moment, Dave and I noticed a group of sea lions leaving the rocks and heading straight toward Armando.

“Get on the board!” we shouted.

He tried again — and finally succeeded. The timing was perfect. The distance was enough to leave the unfriendly colony behind.

Then the cove revealed itself — calm, protected on both sides by towering vertical mountains. A secluded, pristine beach appeared, with soft sand and unbelievably clear water. Paradise.

We landed on our Day Three campsite: Playa Embudo.",1,1763955108.0,underwaterphotography,1,1.0,False

Hi there internet stranger !
I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am, mainly a buddy to text about everything and nothing and the glorious nonsense in between. If that sounds like you then keep reading :)

Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click :
I’m a 21 year old with ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking and crafting. I make a million playlists for every mood and then never listen to them again and end up hoarding them on my iPod. 

I don’t really enjoy watching movies but I love series (currently watching Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I like going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I enjoy online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. I’m up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click.

Things to expect if we become friends
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)
• Random song recommendations
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

yesterday i rehearsed saying “i’m lonely” out loud while my ramen cooked, and the steam fogged my glasses so bad i cried into the broth.

i work from my closet, literally, because the lightbulb is warm and it smells like cedar and old sneakers, and sometimes i pretend the hum of the laptop is another person breathing. last week i wore the same hoodie for six days straight, spilled coffee on it twice, and still hugged it at 3 a.m. because it felt like someone was holding me back. i haven’t touched another human in four months, unless you count the cashier who handed me change and whose fingers brushed mine and i thought about it for the rest of the week.

does anyone else store up tiny moments like that and replay them until they feel bigger than they really are, or am i just hoarding loneliness?",1,1763955006.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.6,False
1p56h5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiritualAwakening/comments/1p56h5a/i_finally_understand_what_a_psychic_attack_is_i/,I finally understand what a psychic attack is! I hope this helps others.,"I’m in midst of something major in my life right now. I’ve been doing the awakening thing in small spurts throughout my life. Times I look back on now and understand in retrospect. I’m on the no turning back path at this point. I’ve been feeling really amazing lately. Being conscious of my reactions. Feeling through my emotions. Transmuting trauma. 

Anyway, I woke up earlier after my overnight shift feeling my recent baseline which is good/neutral. Got up to make myself a cup of coffee. I’m standing in the kitchen when started to feel a tightness in my chest, and fluttering in my stomach. I did my usual observation thing when all of a sudden I have the thought, “I’m so depressed”. I was taken aback a bit because I’m definitely not depressed. I’m at a point in my life where I feel immense peace and relief from the void of hopelessness. I understand what I must do on this journey, and this statement is completely contradictory. It was in MY OWN VOICE! But somehow still not my voice! Like a mimic of me’s voice! And I realized that I had heard this exact voice, exact phrase, exact everything before 100x over the years. The only difference is I thought it was me before just having a reminder that I was depressed! I had heard the term psychic attack before but didn’t really understand what it was. Now I can correlate it. 

I figured if I didn’t understand it, others might not either because it’s kind of a sneaky thing. When you hear of it before you understand what it is, you expect it to be something more obvious. You say “nah I don’t think I’m being psychically attacked. I’m just depressed.” You think it’s your thought. Now that I feel better and am much more conscious of my thoughts and voice, it’s much easier to spot the mimic. I hope this helps someone. ",3,1763954874.0,SpiritualAwakening,1,1.0,False

Dan and Amy Part 39



They head off to work. Enjoying the ride and each other’s company. They get to work and both head off to get work done. 

About an hour in, Amy’s phone pings with a message from Dan. It is a picture from that morning, her blissfully asleep. She smiles at the beautiful picture. About 10:00 Sarah comes in for a quick chat before coffee. 

“So you guys do anything fun last night?” Sarah asks innocently. 

“Just had a friend out. We went for a Jeep ride and had Taco Tuesday.” Amy replied. 

“Sounds like a fun evening.”

“We are just a couple of boring people.” Amy says, trying not to betray anything. Just then her phone pings again with another picture from Dan. She ignores it. 

“The four of us might have to do Taco Tuesday so you can meet my new guy!” Sarah says innocently. 

“That would be fun.” Amy replies, having to start thinking about baseball. Her phone pings again.  

“Do you need to get that?”

“No it’s just Dan.”

“You’ve talked about how much you guys enjoy doing Taco Tuesday up right. It sounds like fun!”

“After vacation we will have you guys out for supper.” Amy’s kitty is now wet, knowing what they did last night, and what Dan’s text messages probably were pictures from this morning. She can feel herself getting flustered. “Sarah I better go find out what Dan is up to.”

Amy goes to Dan’s office and he isn’t there. Swings by Charlie’s office and nobody is there. She walks into the break room. Dan is just sipping coffee and making small talk. Amy walks up to the group. 

“I don’t want to interrupt but I need Dan to review some paperwork.” Trying to sound nonchalant, although her heart is beating out of her chest. She turns around and heads to her office. 

Dan walks into her office. “ What the hell were you thinking Daniel sending me all those pictures from this morning! Sarah is in here asking if we did anything special last night and saying her and her new boyfriend would like to do Taco Tuesday with us! Fuck! I’m getting worked up thinking about last night and you’re sending me risqué pictures!”

“Did you look at the pictures?”

“Hell no! What if she would of seen them!”

“Well look at them now.”

She grabs her phone. “It’s a boat?”

“No, a ship. The one we will be on next week.”

“A map of Alaska?”

“Where we are making stops. I sent you the picture from this morning, because you looked so beautiful in it.”

“Have you looked at all the pictures from this morning?”

“No, because I won’t get anything else done today.” Daddy says with a wicked smile. “We will look at them together, tonight.”

“That sounds like fun Daddy. I’m sorry I flew of the handle.”

Dan laughed. “Don’t be, your no bull shit attitude is something I love. Thank you for apologizing though.  You do keep things interesting.”

“If Sarah wasn’t in here talking about Taco Tuesday it would have been fine. I just got flustered.”

Dan laughed. “I do have a lunch meeting but will be ready to go by five to go to soccer practice.”

They walked back to the break room, laughing at one of Dan’s stupid jokes and had coffee with everyone.  

XOXOXOXO

12:00 hit and Dan headed out to his lunch meeting. He is sitting in a little family restaurant.  A classy looking woman, smartly dressed in a pants suit and heels. The clothes cannot hide her beautiful figure. The only thing giving away her age is her eyes. The knowledge of years shone through. She walks over to the table. 

“Danny, I swear you are aging in reverse!”

“Like you have anything to complain about Tamera! You could still pass as Amy’s younger sister.” 

“Danny you lie, but don’t stop!” 

They both laugh and hug. They talk with the ease of friends of 40 years do.  

“How is Larry? I hope he is excited about the trip.”

“It is all he talks about! This has been a bucket list thing for the two of us for years. We are so excited to share it with you two.”

“When did we get old enough to have a bucket list, Tam. It seems like 5 years ago both our families would get together, fish and ski. The kids got older but we didn’t.”

“The graduations and weddings are just a blur. Now it is just us again.”

“Hopefully a better us!” Dan says with a smile and a laugh. 

“It’s coming up on 3 years Danny. I’m glad life has turned around for you. Amy has been good for you.”

“Yes she is. I got lucky a second time in the love department.”

“You mean third don’t you?”

“No, you were an infatuation. A college crush. Besides you were engaged to one of my best friends.”

Tam smiled. “It did work out how it was supposed to. I will always remember your friendship. Do you ever wonder what might of been?”

“A long time ago yes. Now I have 4 great kids, 3 in-laws, and 5 grandkids and Amy. I can’t believe how lucky I am somedays,”

“Oh, by the way, grandbaby number 3 is supposed to show up in 6 months for Larry and I!”

“So do you and Larry still have the same understanding?”

Tam smiles. “Unfortunately yes. Larry has completely checked out in the sex department. He has tried everything and is over it. I love him. He still loves me, cares for and about me. However I have to find satisfaction somewhere else and he is okay with that. So why didn’t you call me when you were single? You knew the situation.”

“I picked up the phone many times. For the first year I wasn’t ready. The second year, I had many offers, but nothing felt right.”

“You my friend are a romantic to your core. Then Amy came along.”

“People say I changed as soon as she started working for me.”

“You have always had an eye for the pretty ones.”

“Amy isn’t just a pretty face. She works hard at her job, on the farm and making me happy.”

“I imagine, also fantastic in bed.”

“Definitely.”

Tam laughs. 

“So Amy and I have played with a third. A woman. Would that interest you?” Dan asks as he takes a drink of iced tea. With the same inflection as if talking about the weather.

The color washes out of Tam’s face.  “I have never been with a woman. Is this an invitation or are you just tormenting me with the thought of after 40 years finally getting to see if the stories I heard are true?”

“That my dear friend is up to my bride to be.” Dan says with a rye smile. 

Talk the rest of lunch turns to the cruise and the engagement surprise for Amy. 

After lunch they cross the street and walk 2 blocks to a jewelry store. They walk in the front door a bell rings and they wait. You can hear rustling in the back. Out walks an elderly gentleman, about five and a half foot tall, thin and slightly bent over. Wearing a tailored three piece suit. His face lights up when he sees who the customer is. 

“Danny Boy, how are you! Good to see you again. I’ve been expecting you.”

“Mr Leo how are you! How are the Yankees doing?”

“They are a bunch of bums. It’s like they are to busy counting their money to worry about the game. I’ll go get the ring out of the safe.”

Tamera looks at Dan. “He hasn’t changed in the last 35 years!”

“Mr Leo is truly one of a kind.”

Leo brings out the ring and hands it to Dan. “I keep saying I’m done. I’m not going to make any more rings. But what would I do, with Sharon gone.  She must be a special woman Danny. I haven’t done a custom ring this nice in years.”

Dan opens the box. The ring almost lights up the room. A large square cut diamond with smaller diamonds surrounding it all mounted on a gold band. 

“You did well Dan!” Tam said with a hint of envy. 

“Amy told me explicitly what she wanted.” Dan said with a smile. “Big and expensive!” Even Mr Leo had to laugh at that. 

“Do you have the fake ready also?” Dan asks. 

“Why did you get a fake too?” Tam asks. 

“Because I’m going to be so nervous I’ll probably drop it! I’m also not ashamed to admit it!”

Mr Leo and Tamera laugh at Dan’s answer. “I’ll go get it.” Mr Leo says as he heads to the back room.  “I put my initials on the inside of the real one so you can tell them apart. 

Dan hands the fake to Tam. “I’m trusting you with this one. I’ll never be able to keep it hidden. This one is going in the safe at home.” 

Dan paid Mr Leo and they headed back to Tam’s car. They made small talk on the way back.

“Danny, Larry and I are very happy for you and Amy. I’m not going to lie, I would love to be a third for you two.”

“I will talk with Amy.” Dan says with a knowing smile. “No promises.”

XOXOXOXO 

At 5:00 Amy knocks on Dan’s office door. 

“I’m ready to go. Are you?” 

Dan looks up at Amy. She has changed into a simple T-shirt and shorts. Those beautiful long legs on display for everyone to see. Lean and athletic, the shorts, hugging her bum perfectly. 

“I’ll go anywhere and anytime you want Baby Girl! You look to good to hang out with 7 and 8 year old boys.”

“Oh and what about 60 year old boys?”

“We would be stopping and buying you a set of baggy sweats my dear.” He took her hand pulled her in for a quick kiss and the out the door they went. 

Dan spent soccer practice talking to Jade and sharing fruit snacks with Katie.  It was fun watching Amy interact with the boys again. As he sat there you could see the boys gain confidence.  Praise was frequent, and when something went amiss, it was a teaching moment. The boys were gaining confidence the whole time. They were all disappointed they found out “Coach Amy” was going to miss the game. She promised to have Jade FaceTime her so should could watch the game. 

Amy joined Dan and Katie on the walk back to the Jeep. All the boys came came up and gave her a high five before leaving. When they got to the parking lot, there was Susan, sitting in a Jeep Wrangler TJ with the top off. 

“Susan! Where did this come from?” Amy asked. 

“After the other night’s ride, I decided I need more fun in my life. I work hard. I need to play a little more.  As looking at a little property out your way, for a get away place.”

“Good for you! If you’re out our way, drive by and make sure everything is under control while we’re gone.” Dan says. 

“Will do.” Harry piles into the passenger seat, obviously proud of Mom’s new ride. “Time for dinner. We will talk again.” Susan heads out. 

Dan tried to load Katie into her seat, but she wouldn’t go till Grandma Amy gives her a hug and kiss. It made both of them happy.  Jade and Amy hugged then they took off. They walked to the Jeep holding hands. 

“You want to stop for a burger or go home?” Dan asks. 

“I’ve got burgers at home for supper. Let’s go home. Besides the sooner we eat, the sooner I get to critique your photography skills.”

“They will be amazing. With you as my beautiful muse, it will be almost impossible to fail”

“You have gotten almost to good at flirting Daddy.” Amy coos. “So what did you think of the boys during practice?”

“Oh! There were little boys out there too? I didn’t notice.” Amy just shakes her head.  “I’ll admit it’s fun to watch those little guys trying so hard and have fun at the same  time.”

Dan opens the door for Amy, who whispers “ It was hard to concentrate, while you were being a sexy Grandpa with Katie.” Gives him a peck on the cheek and slides in. They chat about their day and the weekend on the way home.  

XOXOXOXO 

Dan comes in from the evening chores. Amy has finished her shower and is wearing his shirt, cooking burgers and a salad.  

“Do we have to eat a salad?” Dan asks. 

“If we’re going to get pregnant, it means eating healthier. So buck up big guy!”

Dan laughs. “Yes dear.” He then finishes setting the table. Amy turns around and he is gone. In just a moment he comes out of the bedroom wearing a sport coat, carrying 2 candles. Setting the candles on the table and lighting them. Amy sets the plates on the table. Dan dims the 
lights and pulls out her chair.

“So is this how boring people,  like us, eat burgers on a Wednesday night?” Amy teases. 

“Why yes it is. Didn’t you see the article in Boring magazine?”

 All Amy could think was, if he wanted to he would.  “You know, this getting romanced, is something I could easily get used to.”

“Well, I kinda enjoy having your presence here.”

“Why flattery will get you everywhere sir!”

Both laugh. “So Sarah got you flustered this morning, talking about Taco Tuesday.”

“It was so innocent and she really wants us to meet him. I don’t think she means in that way!”

“So what if there is someone I know, who would like to be a  third?”

Amy eyes Dan. “Who might that be?”

“Tamera.”

“Larry and Tamera that we are going to Alaska with?”

“Yes.”

“Dan she’s married! What about Larry?”

“Long story short he has checked out in the bedroom department and is okay with her discreetly getting her pleasure from someone else.” 

“Wow. You know I have no desire for any other man.”

“I know. Just think about it.” 

“I will. What do you think of Susan’s new purchase? What is going on with that?”

“At 36 she is discovering who she is. Was so focused on becoming a doctor then had a baby, she is just trying to figure out who she is. Just like you.”

“What do you mean just like me?!”

“Well you graduated college, fell in love and it wasn’t long till that headed south. So there you sit, having to pick up the pieces. Move here for the job, that goes well and soon you are looking to fill your life with brings you happiness.”

“Or in your case peace.”

“My peace is a cute little blonde, with a short fuse and a hot temper. That hates boring sex!”

They finished dinner talking about the weekend ahead. After the table was cleared they go to the den and cuddle up on the couch. 

“Picture time Daddy!”

Dan pulls out his phone and shows Amy the first picture from that morning.  

“That looks nothing like the picture you sent me.”

“I’ll show you what I do.” They flip through a couple more pictures till there is one Dan likes. “So you can crop the picture so it’s centered, then adjust the exposure, the warmth, color balance, shadows and brightness.” In a matter of two minutes a beautiful picture is revealed. 

“That is actually fascinating how you do that, you have a good eye.” Amy said, surprised at his skill. 

“When you have a beautiful model it’s easy.”

They go through the pictures and a video pops up. Dan starts the video. It started when Dan had handed the phone to Amy. It shows Dan moving between her legs to eat her kitty.  At first it is steady but the image soon begins to shake. The moans begin to get louder on the audio. Soon Amy tossed phone aside and the video was of the ceiling. But the audio was filled with moaning and whimpering from the orgasm she had while Dan work his magic down south. Dan stopped the video. 

Amy looked Daddy dead in the eyes.  

“What the hell are you waiting for!” 

She stands up grabs his hand and stands him up. Instantly his pants are at his knees. His manhood, fully erect and being passionately pleasured. There was no teasing this time, this full blown lust and passion as she continued to stare into his eyes. His sport coat and shirt tossed aside. Soon his balls we’re sucked into her hungry mouth.  

“Oh FUCK Baby Girl!” His knees buckling. 

She releases him from her mouth with a pop. Turning around and shedding her shirt, she goes over to the black leather chair. Putting her knees on the seat cushion and grabs the back of the chair. The look of desire she gave Dan was anything but innocent. 

No words were spoken as Dan moved into position.  As he slide into her kitty, Amy almost orgasmed from the insertion. 

“Breed my Daddy!” Broke the silence. 

Tonight was about passion, about the need to be animalistic. It was wild and uninhibited.  

“Fuck! I love you!” As Dan pounded into this beauty, who was his. 

Hands on her hips, she met every thrust with the same intensity. The orgasms first one, then another and then another kept coming. There was no let up. She could feel her brain shut down as the pleasure washed over her. There was no longer sound or light. Then with on final thrust, his reward for her was released. Filling not only her body but her soul.

A rewards platform thats designed to help local coffeeshops stand out - and designed to give customers more and better rewards for being loyal to their local coffeeshops.

Although after developing the app halfway, and reaching out to local coffee shops for them to try out the app and get feedback on what to improve and what certain features to focus on, I've realized that most shops are not interested.

Im here looking for ideas of how to make this app more appealing to baristas and coffee shop owners. Open to pivoting on my idea.

  
Currently the features of the app are: 

\- classic rewards platform for customers to earn and redeem rewards  
\- unique rewards to keep users using our app  
\- a central platform to view your rewards for all stores that are participating with us  
\- integration with popular existing POS systems like Square

  
As a barista or avid coffee shop visitor, what are some problems that you deal with that can be solved with some sort of technology?

What are some ways this rewards platform can be tweaked so that it's more appealing to coffee shop owners? Is the rewards platform market too saturated?",1,1763954607.0,barista,1,1.0,False
1p56dp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1p56dp7/sensitive_to_bitter_usa_machine_recommendations/,"Sensitive to bitter, USA machine recommendations [<$600]","I am looking for recommendations / good deal on a USA model automatic espresso machine for $600 or less unless it is an insane deal. Ideally in the $200-300 range. Milk frothing is optional. Auto grind and easy cleaning is preferred, as is easy or low mantainence.

I am sensitive to bitter, so I have gathered I like a lower temp brew and a slower extraction or finer grind. I prefer a medium dark roast that is rich and bold, but not too bitter.

I generally go for dirty coffee, warm or cold milk, with some sugar.  Steamed and foam can be nice but is only a bonus.

I currently have a ceramic hand grinder that does a good job, but espresso grinds are a good deal more time and work when in a hurry. I have a cheap Melitta MEX1B no pump style espresso machine now. I stop at half brew, dump the steam (removed the nozzle) add ice / water and start again, hoping to remember to stop it before it makes a bitter brew.

Years ago a place had a 2010's era Jura machine with a separate milk container and a hose connected to a frother. It looked similar to an E8, but the frother was on the left and had buttons with a dot matrix screen. It was usually filled with Peets Major Dickenson's blend. That got me hooked. It had a little bite, but was not too bitter and full of flavor. A strong shot could get a 1:4 ratio of milk or more. Outside of that machine, even brewed, Major Dickenson's blend has been more bitter. Peets Big Bang is my current main stream choice for reference.

One button with auto grind would nice for being in a hurry in the morning, but a separate electric grinder could work as long as after loading and tamping the rest can be auto. Adjustability in temperature and water volume is preferred, but I am not sure how much they really vary.

There appear to be some good deals on the Philips 3X00 series, though not the one with the potentially lower temp iced coffee option. I heard the grinder is durable and decent. A 2X00 series without the latte option might be good but I have not seen much for discounts or specifics on the grinder other than some are lower quality with less adjustment.
The Costco Ninja Lux Cafe could be a decent deal, but there are mixed reviews and list pricing appears a little inflated 
The Breville and DeLongi options are overwhelming with many opinions. 

I am hoping for a Black Friday deal. Any helpful guidance is appreciated",0,1763954583.0,superautomatic,0,0.5,False
1p56b0i,https://i.redd.it/qbs5owvuh43g1.png,It Started on a Monday (part 1),"It started on a Monday. It would have been like any other day if I didn’t make a terrible mistake. It’s strange how fragile humans are, one accidental nudge and suddenly you’re falling down three steps. The lucky ones aren’t harmed in any way, they get up and go about the rest of their day. The unlucky ones fall backwards, hit their head on the ground in just the right way and die. 



The eerily still girl at the bottom of the steps was one such unlucky person. I had been rushing down the stairs to get to my evening class, and there she was running up the stairs to get back to her dorm. And then, she was gone. 



It was an accident, a truly random stroke of misfortune. I wouldn’t have been charged, I could have been the one laying at the bottom of the stairs if I had been slightly less lucky. I knew this but I still ran to class and went about my life as normal. I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t sleep, but even if I did call the authorities what good would it have done? She would be found in the morning, not many people took the stairs but surely someone would find her right? 



The light of dawn made me realize how stupid and cowardly I had been. I slept fitfully so I was awake early. I walked into the stairwell, phone in hand, ready to confess what I had done. If the police thought my actions suspicious and threw me in jail for homicide then that was fine, I deserved it for being such a coward. 



I walked down the stairs and she was gone. I figured someone else had reported it but that explanation didn’t sit right with me. I slept so poorly the night before I would have definitely heard the commotion if a body was found in the stairwell. Actually, wouldn’t the police be questioning students right now if a body was found?



I sat in the cafeteria halfheartedly eating breakfast, I was looking through news reports and social media accounts associated with my school. I found nothing. 



“Morning Ethan. What’s up,” Jess sat next to me and started talking excitedly like usual. 



I had known Jess since we were both kids. She was my best friend through thick and thin. If I could tell anyone what happened, it was her. I couldn’t just let this be so I told her, I felt so much better now that I told someone.



“Did you even stop to check and see if she was dead?” She asked. 



“No, I guess I was so freaked out I didn’t,” I responded. 



“In that case, maybe she was just unconscious? After you left maybe she just got up and went back to doing whatever,” Jess offered. 



“That makes the most sense, I should find her and apologize. Man I suck,” I commented. 



I decided to find her that night and apologize as sincerely as I could. That time never came, that night I was sent an automated alert from the campus safety system telling me that Belle T was missing and if we had any information we should contact the police. Attached was a photo, it was definitely her, I couldn’t forget that face. 



I drove to the police station and sat in a room with a detective. I told them everything, they were naturally suspicious of me. They let me go after hearing my story with the caveat that they would check out my alibi. 



I went into the police station many times after that. My story was the same, my alibi was as airtight as it could be. They had my roommate’s testimony, camera footage showing me walking to class at the same time I said I was, testimony from my professors that I was in class. In fact there was a camera right outside of the door to the stairwell.



I did not know her so no motive there. They tried really, really hard to find a way for me to have done it but in the end the police were forced to clear me of any suspicions. I wasn’t even charged for the death, they couldn’t find a body and as far as any of us knew she could still be alive.



\*\*\*\*

Dear Diary,



The other day Ethan did something really really bad. But its okay, I will always be there to help him out of any mess he finds himself in. I’m really glad I fought with mom and dad to live on campus. Not only do I not have a roommate, I got a room right above his. This building is so old and shitty I can hear it any time Ethan leaves his room, it’s great!



I was a floor above when it happened. I watched him run away like a scaredy cat when that girl died. I checked to see if she was dead, she was. It was late enough at night that I could drape the girl over my shoulder and pretend like she was passed out drunk if I ran into anyone. Luckily I didn’t. It was super tiring carrying all that weight up to the bathroom. 



I didn’t really know what I should do. I knew that the body being found was bad for Ethan and so I had to get rid of it but how? I thought reeaaallly hard about it, I couldn’t get her out of the building in this state and I remembered reading about a girl who was dismembered and scattered around campus before being found so that was no good. I needed to go smaller. 



As I cut her up I separated her into two piles, edible and inedible. I had a kitchenette with a freezer and fridge so I put what I could of the meat into that. What I couldn’t fit I took in multiple trips to the chest freezer at my house. My parents didn’t use it very often, it was deep into the garage and when I opened it to deposit the bags of meat I had smuggled out in my backpack, I noticed that all the meat in it was super old. 



I don’t think they’ll eat it but if they do it’s no biggie. 



Then I had to deal with all the organs and skin and stuff that would rot, so I went to the grocery store and bought a lot of stuff and cooked like hell. None of the food came out looking particularly good but I was just going to throw it away anyways. When it was in the trash, it looked like leftovers so it was okay. 



The bones were really annoying. They weren’t super clean and white like the bones you think of. I couldn’t get all the sinew and stuff off. I doused them in bleach for a long time, then I got a stepladder and popped open a panel that made up the ceiling and shoved them up there. 



Clean up wasn’t bad either, I chopped her up naked in the shower so all I needed to do was run the water and tada everything was fine. If not for the large amount of meat in my fridge and the skeleton in the ceiling you wouldn’t even know anything happened at all. 



I wasn’t even worried when the police came to search. They took a whole week to finally search the dorms. They interviewed me too but I have been watching over Ethan for so long that I am really good at building an alibi if I need it. 



Speaking of Ethan looks a lot more worried these days. I can’t talk to him but he’s got Jess so I hope she helps him out. His phone data has him at the police station a lot. I wonder if the police think he did it? Since he didn’t do the nasty part he should be okay. 



\*\*\*\*

The fall semester had been cancelled. There was an instance of something called “mass psychogenic illness” it mostly affected the freshman class for some reason. The authorities and admin were incredibly tightlipped about the whole thing so Jess and I exchanged theories about it but eventually got bored and stopped talking about it. 



Since I already lived close to campus the school shutting down wasn’t too much of an inconvenience, Jess lived next door too so most of our time was spent playing video games in each other's rooms or watching stuff we found online. 



I kept checking the news to see if Belle had been found but there was nothing. Nothing on the thing that had caused the school to shut down either. I was curious but with so little information to go off of I couldn’t do much. Theories circulated online like wild, the school’s reputation for being a place of evil was more prominent than ever. 



I kind of agreed with the notion that the school was cursed, even if Jess laughed at me for it. Well, I had instate tuition and it was close to home so whether it was cursed or not, I was attending when it opened back up. 



And open back up it did, all of the classes were out of sync with their normal schedule and quite a few people dropped out but come spring semester things felt normal. 



Things were normal until I got mugged. I was drunkenly walking back from some bar near campus when a man with a gun pointed at me directed me towards an isolated spot away from the street lights. Looking back at it now his actions seemed ridiculous, why would you mug a college student? A drunken haze fogs my memories of his exact demands so it’s possible he had a different one. 



At the time I was enraged, why was this man keeping me from the sanctity of my bed? It was stupid to fight back, I could have died over fifteen dollars and some change but I didn’t. I waited until he had me backed against a wall and when he was distracted by listing his insane demands I wrenched the gun out of his hand and it went flying to the ground. 



The balance of power had shifted tremendously in my favor. I was taller, stronger, and much angrier than him. You wouldn’t think swimmers had much strength but we do. I punched him in the face and he reeled back. I punched again before he could get his bearing and he went to the ground. 



I beat that fuckers head in until I felt less angry. The memory gets a little hazy here, I don’t know how long I spent straddling his chest and punching him. I gave up when his face caved in and walked back to the dorms. My hands were covered in a mixture of my blood and his. I washed my hands before going to bed. 



\*\*\*\*

Dear Diary, 



Ethan did that really bad thing again. I was following him back to his dorm when a guy pulled a gun on him. I was worried at first but not super worried. Ethan gets really angry when he gets drunk so as long as he could get the gun away he would be fine. 



I really like that about him. He’s just so interesting. He’s very cute and nice when he’s sober but when he drinks he’s fighting and punching for no reason at all. I don’t even think he remembers it! I’ve been thinking about talking to him when he’s drunk since he wouldn’t remember me but I just can’t. He’s too amazing I think my heart would explode!



As for the man, I really had to think on my feet. If Ethan had just shot him it could have been written off as a gang thing or just a mugging gone wrong but the way the body was now It was too unsightly to just be that. 



The night was quiet and this part of town was pretty bad plus there were no cameras I could see! I grabbed my car and loaded the body into the trunk. From there I just drove outside of town and dumped it in some woods near my house. I didn’t bother burying it, no one goes in them. I didn’t need to be too careful since if this type of person disappears no one really cares.



The trunk was all gross after that so I washed it. I couldn’t get all the blood out but I could spill coffee on top of it. It didn’t really make more sense than blood being there but who was gonna check my trunk anyways? 



I wish it could be break again. I can look into Ethan’s room from my own just fine, I got a worse dorm this semester, not even in the same building. He hasn’t noticed me like usual. Well I guess you get used to being watched after a bunch of years.



Jess has been as helpful as ever. Actually Jess is my best friend. She told me that when I snuck into her room after I killed her dog when we were kids. She cried and cried a lot for that dog. I didn’t threaten her but she got the message and hasn’t told anyone about me since we’re such good friends. She was very helpful when it came to getting Ethan’s phone.



I think Jess likes Ethan. I want them to go out already, the romantic tension is palpable when they’re together. I wonder if she isn’t doing so for my sake. That’s so silly of her, I love Ethan so much it hurts but not in that way. I don’t want to marry Ethan, I want to consume him. 



\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning seriously hung over. My hands hurt enough that checking my phone was difficult. The memories of the night before were hazy, but I still remembered that I had killed someone again, on purpose this time. A flash of guilt spread through me as I remembered this. 



I knew somewhat that this would happen eventually. I woke up a lot with vague memories of beating the shit out of someone and random injuries. It was only a matter of time before I did something really bad. 



The drinking started in high school. One of my buddies invited me to a party and I felt so relieved for the first time that drinking became a regular habit. Nothing had helped me before, not the therapists, not the medications, nothing let me feel just so free from it all. 



I had a memory from way back when I was a kid, I guess you would call it a “repressed memory” although I’d argue the phrasing is incorrect. I do remember it, I just can’t remember it without going catatonic. It festers in the back of my mind and seeps into everything. When I drink, I can’t remember it. When I drink, I can feel like myself. 



All the frustration I had at myself, at the adults who didn’t help, at “it” was no longer confined by social expectations. This frustration had my temper on a hair pin trigger and after I beat up all my buddies one night I started drinking alone. 



I pulled up the local news, nothing about any horrendous murders or a body being found where I was last night. I didn’t feel that guilty about this one, maybe I went too far but this guy was scum. I wouldn’t go to the police, he was better off just disappearing. 



I did tell Jess though. 

“So yeah, that’s what happened,” I explained while the two of us were eating lunch. 



“I see. Well it’s probably fine. You said you’ve been checking the news but no body has been found right?”



“Yeah. Weird though. Think the school has cursed me?”



“I do wonder,” Jess trailed off before finishing her sentence.



“Do you have an idea?”



“Nah. You’re right, you’re probably cursed. Better get your will ready before the school eats you,” she joked.



“It’s a very convenient curse though. Like I’d probably be in prison right now if it didn’t exist. Well maybe the curse is that I keep getting put in situations where I accidentally kill someone before their body disappears. That seems more curse like right?”



“Probably better to just not think about it. You’ll go nuts if you keep ruminating on it.”



Jess was right but I couldn’t help but think I was cursed in some way or another. Not like I could really do anything about it. I did go to church for the first time in a long while, I figured if I was cursed then some Jesus wouldn’t hurt. 



I had already gone mad, well my drunken self had. Every time I drank I kept thinking about how good it had felt to just let it all out. To feel someone come undone by my hands. It was a morbid fixation I had and when I caught myself planning to kill someone in cold blood I stopped drinking. 



I missed alcohol but the fleeting joy of beating people to death was just that: a fleeting joy. When the alcohol wore off all that was left was a jumble of images of blood and a guilt so overpowering I wanted to die. 



When I told Jess about my thoughts she looked deeply and incredibly concerned. Her concern seemed deeper than just worrying about her best friend murdering people in a drunken stupor, but it was also possibly my imagination. 



“I know you hate talking about this Ethan but I really think you need to open up about what happened in the woods that day,” Jess randomly said when we were studying one day. 



“You know I can’t remember it really,” I replied. 



“That’s bullshit. I know you can. You know it really weighs on me too, if I had just not been so mad at you that day and went out to play with you maybe things would be different.”

That cold, cloudy day in March I had asked Jess to come play with me. We had fought the previous day over something stupid and childish and she hadn’t forgiven me quite yet. With no playmate I wandered into the woods alone. 



My parents found me wandering out of the woods in a trance. I was covered in blood. Was it my blood? Some of it probably was. Most of it was not. The police questioned me, my parents questioned me, therapists questioned me. How did a five year old boy brutally kill an adult man like that? I never answered them except to tell them that I hadn’t really done anything. When they pressed the subject I refused to answer. 



In the end the authorities gave up. Even if I had killed him, it was in totally justifiable self defense. The man had a record. And so life went on but I didn’t. Not really, for the longest time every time I closed my eyes I was five years old and looking for something to do on a dreary spring day. 



“I don’t blame you Jess. What difference could you have made? If anything I’m glad you didn’t come, you’d be traumatized too,” I replied to her confession. 



“But you won’t tell anyone about it. At least if I had gone through it too you’d have someone to tell about it. It’s just so frustrating to see you bottle it up even though it’s clearly making you miserable,” she responded. 



“Don’t be like that. You still haven’t told me what happened to your dog. If you’re gonna make me open up then you should to,” I argued. 



“That’s different,” she argued back.



“No it’s not.”



 I regretted what I said almost immediately. Jess loved that dog like it was a little sister. Then something happened to it, something horrific and Jess lost her spirit. I was going through my own stuff so I never pried as a kid but as I got older I noticed a twinge of fear whenever she mentioned Princess and eventually asked. She was as stubborn about not talking about it as I was about my own issues.



“Ugh okay fine. To tell the truth someone broke into my house and killed her. They killed her after my parents left and when I got back from school I found her. It was horrible they had tortured her and ripped her organs out and there was blood everywhere. When the police came there was nothing missing. Some fucking lunatic broke into my house just to kill my dog,” Jess had gotten more hysterical and had started sobbing by the time she was done. 



I hugged her while I waited for her to stop sobbing. 



When she did, I said,”I had no idea. I’m so sorry, Jess.”

“It’s not your fault. It just really messed me up.”



“Would I be an ass if I didn’t share now?”



“I can’t believe you are considering not telling me.”



“Well you’re right, I can remember but some of it is fuzzy. I was really scared and confused and it was a long time ago so at this point I don’t even know if that’s what really happened.”



“That doesn’t matter, what’s important is that you’re sharing it.”



“Okay, okay. Well here we go. I was messing around in the woods when that creepy guy from a few doors down came out of nowhere. I grabbed the biggest rock I could and just took off, I thought maybe he had like an actual reason to be out there. 



After I stopped I heard him running after me, he was in the direction of my house so I figured I would just run a big loop and escape that way. And then I tripped, knocked the wind out of me so bad I gave the fucker enough time to catch up to me. 



I was so scared but I still had that rock so I threw it at him. I hit him in the head but it didn’t stop him. I realized I had thrown away my only weapon and I started crying. I kept crying as he kept getting closer, I didn’t know what was going to happen but I was so fucking scared. Then he grabbed my shirt and forced me onto the ground. 



I remember thinking that he would take me away and I’d never see you or mom or dad ever again and it just made me cry harder. And then, all of a sudden his grip loosened and he swore. 



He let me go and turned around and I was too scared to be happy that I was saved. Whoever saved me wasn’t my parents or the police. They had a knife, I could see the stab wound on his back. 



He fought that person a bit, I thought he was going to win since this person was smaller than him. Then they must have stabbed him in the right place because he fell over and he had fallen on my leg. 



Then I saw it,” I finished. 



“What did you see Ethan,” Jess asked me softly. 



“I don’t know how to describe it. My memories of it are the fuzziest of them all. Whenever I think of it I see some sort of monster wearing the skin of a girl my age. I mean I know she wasn’t a monster but her eyes, they were just completely dead.



She didn’t have any expression on her face, she wasn’t happy or angry, she just looked like she was doing chores or something.



Once he was down she just kept stabbing him. Both me and the man were pleading with her to stop and then when the man died it was only me pleading. She did stop eventually, she laid the knife on the ground and picked up a rock. She jabbed the rock into the man’s wounds, all of them. I didn’t have the energy to plead any more so I just sat there and watched and thought about everyone I ever knew. 



I thought I was next, I thought when she was done with the man she would kill me next. She didn't. Instead she forced the rock into my hand and then smiled at me. She almost looked like a normal girl for once. Before I could say anything to her or make sense of what just happened she picked up the knife without a word and just walked off.”



“And you never told anyone about her?”



“No. She was wearing gloves and I think I remember the police writing off any other DNA as previous victims of the man. I didn’t know why she did that thing with the rock until after I was questioned by the police. They kept asking me where I hid the knife. I guess she was just a kid too, there was no way anyone would believe that a rock made such deep wounds.”



“Why didn’t you tell anyone about her?”



“When I was a kid I couldn’t sleep for months after that. I kept thinking about how if I told anyone she would break into my house and kill me. I mean she didn’t threaten me or anything but I was just terrified of even speaking about her. And then as I got older, I realized that she had been trying to mislead the police. The day I had that thought I felt just as scared as when I was a kid. I mean, she was my age and she was already thinking about tampering with evidence. If she was older, I thought about how she could probably get away with it now.”

Dear Diary, 



Today Jess and Ethan were talking about the first time they met me! I was so happy to hear Ethan talk about me for the first time that I had to try really hard to sit in my chair still so they wouldn’t get suspicious of me. 



It’s also been so long that anything has made me realize that I am not normal. I guess I’ve gotten so used to blending in that I automatically know what emotions I should display. They called me really mean things, like a monster and a lunatic and my brain told me I should be angry to be called such bad things but I was so so happy to hear Ethan speak about me that I was a little shocked by the dissonance. 



Hearing Ethan talk about that day made me super nostalgic. My parents had pretty much given up on me, mom was supposed to be homeschooling me but my behavior meant I got kicked out of the house until dinner time. I was so bored so I was wandering around the woods looking for something to do. 



The doctors when I was a kid always said I couldn’t feel emotions like a normal person but when I saw Ethan, poor, scared, crying Ethan I did feel something. I call it “love” but it’s so deep and unique to me that I don’t think that’s the right word. Still, it’s the closest word so that’s what I call it. 



I could see Ethan’s bedroom from my own room and I would spy on him occasionally, he lived in the house behind mine and always kept his blinds open. Before that day I didn’t think much of him, he was boring. He was boring just like the rest of them. Then I saw the faces he made when he was scared. I saw him make so many funny faces that day that I couldn’t help but fall in love. I think my favorite expression he made was when I smiled at him, I’ll never forget it. 



Thanks to Ethan I turned over a new leaf. I loved watching him in his room but I wanted more. I wanted to live life around him without him even knowing. So I practiced knowing what face to make in which situation. I practiced and practiced and practiced so hard that my parents thought I was just a weird kid. When I was taken to a new set of doctors most of them couldn’t believe that I was anything but a normal girl. 



There was one who thought something was off, I guess I was too practiced. Still she thought I was harmless and with all that out of the way I could finally attend public middle and high school. 



I did my best to be as unremarkable as I could. I got normal grades, I had a normal amount of friends, I looked normal. It was so worth the effort, everyday I could watch Ethan and see new sides of him. How he looked when talking to his male friends, how he looked when fretting over his grades.



I was only ever in a class with him once, we actually worked on a group project together. I thought I was going to explode with excitement and stress. What if he remembered me? What if I did something to stand out to him? I did my part of the project with extra care to be as mediocre as possible. 



Then over summer break, I cut and dyed my hair, changed up my fashion, and started wearing contacts. It worked, never once has Ethan recognized me. Even Jess who I would sometimes contact didn’t recognize me after that. 



We were both with some of our friends walking to class when the two of us accidentally bumped into each other. Jess saw me without looking even the tiniest bit scared. It was so funny. My friends asked me why I was laughing and I remembered that it wasn’t normal to laugh randomly so I lied. 

There’s one last thing I’ve been thinking about. Ethan says he wants to kill. I want to see it, I want to see what face he makes when he kills someone with his own two hands while perfectly sober. Will he cry? Will he laugh? I want to know.

Recently, I’ve started to get into writing. I tend to write about things that cross my mind on any given day. I am thinking about going public with my writing, but I did want to know what the collective here thought about it. 

Let me know what you think:



I have long been of the opinion that Thanksgiving week is one of, if not the best, weeks of the year. This probably is not a remotely “hot take” or controversial opinion, unless your family is completely neurotic, or you know you’ll have to spend Thanksgiving dinner explaining what a “Gender Studies” major is to Granny. For many, it is, at most, a 2.5 day workweek, filled with friends, family, and good food.

Since childhood, Thanksgiving, for me, always meant a trip to New York City. We would all pack into my grandfather’s car, crawl down the Van Wyck to NYC, enjoy a delicious turkey, and watch gleefully as the adults debated the merits of war in Iraq. Thankfully, our family has now enacted a strict no-politics rule at our Thanksgiving.

Nostalgia aside, now that I actually live here, this week seems as good a time as any to show some love toward New York City — a place everyone insists is “dead” at least twice a year.

I was, at least partially, inspired to write this after reading an article this week called: “Why the New York Bodega Is Here to Stay” which touched on the backstory and rise of bodegas in NYC. I must admit, few things make you feel more “at home” than getting hit with the “the usual, sliced turkey brother?” as if I had been around since the Dinkins administration, or the “you want cheese with that boss?” even though I have never said yes.

When I first moved to NYC from Long Island, where everything is always Boar’s Head, I was too naive to recognize the spots with the pre-sliced cold cuts, which gave me my fair share of gastrointestinal trouble, yet also helped me develop bionic immunity. Now, after five years living in NYC, I have become much more adept at rooting out the good bodegas from the bad — while insisting they always slice the turkey in front of me. The bodega, for the most part, may be one of the few places in America where the 2% inflation target is actually being met. Egg and cheese, iced coffee, and a Martinelli’s? — $11 brother.

The bodega is where your daily dose of NYC’s inescapable character only begins (and many times, ends.) If you’re like me, growing up in the suburbs was often uneventful. The biggest rush of adrenaline you got on any given day was catching your buddy’s mom ripping a Marlboro Red from across the cul-de-sac. Now my daily commute on the subway has, unapologetically, exposed me to more bare ass than I care to count. Not that I consider this a good thing, but it is, undeniably, stimulating. Yet, in between those daily slivers of chaos, I get exposed (for good or for bad) to a world of culture and vibrancy that you definitely will not find anywhere else. You go from a full-blown mariachi band to a woman screaming that BET owes her ten million dollars, all before 9 AM. It is all mostly harmless, yet critical to having a true NYC experience. Though, I must say, I have become quite good at shaking my head ‘no’ to the 6-year-old selling Snickers on the F train.

Only once you emerge from the depths of the subway does one really get to appreciate the opportunities NYC has to offer. Now, I understand, my experience may be different than those of my neighbors; however, any city in which you can bounce quickly (and cheaply) from a hole-in-the-wall serving Korean BBQ breakfast burritos with kimchi to a 20-course Omakasé served by a chef who spent a decade slicing fish in Ginza — is a city certain to earn anyone’s heart.

For a nightcap, endless options are presented in front of you: post-dinner drinks at a speakeasy under the guise of an ice cream shop? Down the block. Want to watch a rookie comedian completely bomb? Hop in a cab. Or, maybe, you want to gather in a 220-degree sauna while a Russian man beats you with branches. Just a subway ride away.

“There is no question that there is an unseen world. The problem is, how far is it from midtown and how late is it open?” - Woody Allen

If the culinary variety has not won you over, it only takes one glimpse at the skyline (which I had grown accustomed to seeing from the outskirts of the city) to get me going on any given day. It is grandiose, it is chaotic, and it is one of a kind. It is occupied by both sides of the spectrum, from the self-proclaimed “elites” swaying in 432 Park Ave on “Billionaires Row” all the way to the 3rd generation family living in the same Chinatown rent-controlled apartment as their great-grandmother had in the 1950s. Each equally important to the unwavering identity of NYC.

Unfortunately, for many reasons, NYC has developed a bad reputation of late. Some of it exacerbated by the media, while much of it rooted in legitimate concern. Lunatics infest the subway, homelessness has been left unchecked, and a studio overlooking Rikers will run you $3K a month. Yet, despite these imperfections, so many of us cannot pull away from the beautiful chaos that is this city.

Admittedly, I play the Succession theme song on my AirPods frequently; however, it is certainly more fitting when walking through Central Park as opposed to sitting on the 4 train. The point being, this city makes me feel like I am living in my own movie.

Dan And Amy Part 38

“Life is too short for boring sex!

Dan asks, “Is everyone one good?”

“I could use a shower. Does anyone want to join me?” Susan asks. Dan and Amy stare at each other. 

“Susan, Dan and I have a morning routine. He gets up and makes coffee. I make the bed and lay out my clothes, then go start the shower and wait for him naked. We shower, drink coffee, talk, and sometimes have sex. What’s even better is he wash’s my hair. Is it alright if we don’t want to share that?” Amy asks. 

Susan looks at Dan and Amy. “For some reason, I would expect nothing less from you two!” She goes and takes a quick shower the joins them in bed. 

“I’ll probably be gone when you guys wake up in the morning. Rounds and such. This has been a fun couple of days. I would like to do it again, when you get back.” Susan says as she cuddles up on one side of Dan and Amy on the other. 

“I’m sure something can be arranged. It’s going to take a couple of weeks to get my strength back.” Dan teases. The girls just shake their heads and smile. “Please know if someone comes along in your life, we 100% understand. You only get one chance at this.”

The alarm goes off at 6:00 and it is just Dan and Amy in the bed. Amy cuddled up close. Both of them still naked from last night’s fun. 

Dan quickly shuts off the alarm. Amy is laying there, a sheet pulled up to her neck and one leg uncovered. Looking so innocent, like an angel. He grabs his phone and takes a couple of pictures of her blissfully asleep. She starts to wake up and gives him a satisfied smile. Dan takes another picture. Slowly she pulls the sheet down to reveal more.  Dan keeps snapping pictures. Slowly one breast is uncovered, then the other. Continuously taking pictures. 

Amy grins and plays a little shy, using her hands to cover herself. Dan pulls the sheet down till her navel piercing is exposed. He gently kisses her belly, playing with her navel piercing. Working his way up, he gives booth breasts proper attention. Her breathing becomes ragged. Moans start to fill the room. Now the sheet is just covering her kitty. At this point Amy is incredibly turned on. Dan slides one hand down and begins to finger her kitty.  He slides two fingers in and starts to tease. Within a minute, 
Amy’s hip begin to buck.

“Oh Fuck me Daddy.” Amy whispers. 

“Alright I will!”

Dan hands Amy the camera as he slides around to get between her legs. She captures the hunger in his eyes as he nears her kitty and begins to make love to her. He starts by nibbling on her inner thighs. Gently raising her hips so he has full access to both holes. He knows she will melt as his tongue teases her star fish. It doesn’t take long before another orgasm hits and Amy forgets about taking pictures. With a satisfied smile Dan retrieves the camera. 

He takes a couple of photos as he lines up his rock hard cock, ready to enter her valley. Amy moans with pleasure as he slowly slides in. Tossing the phone aside, her begins to make love to his woman. Slowly stroking in and out. 

“I’m the luckiest man in the world. Finding you has given me more joy than you will ever know. You make me want to be a better version of myself.” He whispers. 

Dan pulls out and slowly enters her back door. Slowly stretching to take him all the way, then begins to thrust harder and faster. The intensity of the pleasure building. 

“Oh Im cumming Daddy!” Is all Amy can say as she wraps her legs around him to pull him in tight as her body begins to shudder. Two more thrusts and Dan’s cock erupts.  Causing him to collapse onto her, momentarily draining his strength. 

Eventually his strength returns and he rolls off to the side and pulls Amy onto him. She places her head on his chest and listens to his heartbeat. They both lay there. Spent. 

“Thank you for delicately handling the shower offer last night.  It is my favorite part of the day.” Dan says just before getting another good morning kiss. 

“Susan really doesn’t do it for you does she.”

“If there was no you, it might be different. She is beautiful, smart and fun to be around but she doesn’t have the it factor. It’s hard to live up to the standards you set my dear.”

“You are going to share those pictures with me.” Amy says with a hint of intimidation. 

“Oh absolutely! I can’t keep something this beautiful to myself.”

Amy smiled. “Are you going to come hang out at soccer practice for an hour? So we don’t have to drive separately.”

“I might have to pick up a couple things for the weekend, maybe get a bottle of bourbon to give your Dad when I ask for your hand in marriage.”  

“Your going to ask my Dad, for my hand? Don’t you dare. You tell Frosty you’re going to marry me! He didn’t earn the nickname Frosty just for his white hair.” Amy says a little riled up. 

“He won’t be a problem. He’s smart and will respect his elders. I’m more worried about Grandma Deb giving me the fifth degree.” Dan says smiling. 

“Now you know she loves you! Always wanting to talking to you on the phone. She always wants to know if I’m cooking for you. As Grandma Deb says, ‘Keep their belly full!’”

“And their balls empty!” Dan says finishing the quote. “Are we going to try and see your mom?”

“I don’t know. In a way, I want to rub our relationship in her face. In another way, I don’t care what she thinks.”

Dan heads to the kitchen to make coffee and Amy packs a sports bag to change into for soccer practice. When he comes back in, Amy is waiting in the shower. Dan hands her a coffee.  Joining her in the shower, she hugs Dan close. 

“How come us two is so easy, but everyone else just makes things harder than they need to be?” Amy asks. “Can you just hold me for a while?”

“I can do that.”

After a few minutes. Dan looks at Amy. “You know you’re letting her win. She doesn’t deserve to take up any space in your head.”

“But she is my mother.”

“The Bitch gave up that title when she sided with your ex-husband in the divorce. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I think there is more to this whole story than you know.” 

Amy grudgingly admitted, “You’re right.”

“Plus you were the grand prize, super show case winner when you caught me!” 

“Yes, I was! So can we schedule sex tonight after dinner? You sir deserve my full attention. Since you are my grand prize.”

“I’m glad you finally realize how lucky you are!” As the smirk spreads across his face. 

Chores were done and breakfast was ready when Dan came back in. 

“So what are we going to tell Frosty, about you and me together. Forever?” Dan asks. 

“We are going to tell him the 100% truth. He probably won’t understand. Then again he might be like, all I care about is me being happy.”

“What about Deb?”

“She probably already has it figured out, picked out a dress for the wedding and praying for great grandchildren.”

Dan laughed. “I’m actually excited to meet them in person. Frosty sounds like a stand up guy and Grandma Deb is your second biggest fan.”

I’ve been in Canada for about 3 years now. Before this, I spent 13 years in the Middle East, always surrounded by friends even after marriage. Life there felt like one long group chat.
But since moving here… not a single real friend. Work is fine, family is great, kids are adorable chaos-makers, but that friend-shaped empty space is getting heavier day by day.
I don’t need anything from anyone—no trying to sell me a house, no pyramid scheme presentations, nothing. Just someone I can talk to without feeling judged. A coffee, tea, or even just a smoke (no drugs or alcohol). I’m not picky about religion, culture, or color humans are humans.I am a man and looking for nothing but to talk even though chats here !! Help me stay afloat in these times!!
I’m a decent guy, loyal, good company, and apparently now at the stage of posting on Reddit like “please someone be my friend before I start talking to squirrels.”
This might be my last attempt at reaching out. If you’re also looking for a genuine friend—or just someone normal to chat with—please reach out. Sometimes even men need a buddy they can talk to.

So I(17F) have been on and off looking for a job for MONTHS. I go to beauty school, which is an hour away. Gas is expensive. And also, lowk, I want to drink energy drinks instead of coffee. Along with other little things I want/need. And, I want to have money. I literally have no money outside of what I have been given. 

My family is going through a rough financial patch. My mom stopped working because of some mental and physical health issues, my grandmother doesnt work due to her age, and my grandfather is weird with money and likely gets money via retirement. The only person whome I can ask for money from is my sister. And she is under a lot of stress since one of her clients accused her of stealing from her. (She works as in home caretaker. FYI, this client has accused all of her previous caretakers of stealing from her. But shes still under investigation.) AND shes trying to pick up the slack from my mother. 


So yes, I desperately need the job. I want to fund my gas, be able to eat the diet I want(I prefer eating healthy, but my family isnt buying foods I like since its more expensive.) So yes, ive been looking for a part time job.

And yesterday, I almost had the PERFECT job opportunity. I was at Sally's, getting some haircolor for my hair. (A friend from my school needs live models, and I offered to let her bleach my hair. Since I want to dye it pink.) And I asked if they were hiring. They said yes, and it was a partime job over the weekends. LITERALLY EVERYTHING I WANT. The manager was there, and she even seemed kinda excited at the idea of hiring me.

But guess what? They dont hire 17 year olds. Nope! You need to be eighteen. Just like most of the jobs in my area. 


Its always ""oh you need work experience for this job"" or ""oh you must be 18 to get this job"" or its ""Must be fulltime"" LIKE WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? 

Ive applied at Walmart FOUR TIMES, ive applied at Fred meyer, Safeway, taco bell, McDonald's, literally any entry level job. And even when I call, I dont get anything back. 



How am I supposed to fucking live? I need a job. I need to try and release SOME of this financial stress. We're close to holidays, and I have a whopping $15 and I need to get gifts for FIVE PEOPLE. I cant crochet it all. Its too much work, and with my going to school 8 hours a day 5 days a week, Im almost always tired and exhausted.  ",5,1763953022.0,Vent,23,0.73,False

1p55tiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodToronto/comments/1p55tiq/i_tried_25_butter_tarts_in_toronto/,I tried 25 butter tarts in Toronto,"hey all, in the last few months I made myself a project to try different butter tarts in Toronto. I tried 25 in total and here’s my notes:

*(side note: I tried to get the classic butter tart, without any added flavours or fillings, unless it was unavailable at the store, so that I could compare them directly.)*

* **Circles and Squares Bakery** (classic butter tart $4.25) : My first butter tart I tried which convinced me to try more butter tarts. The first thing you notice is the size. It’s quite big and thick, almost as if they made the tart shell in a muffin pan rather than a cupcake pan. The crust is buttery and flaky, with a satisfying bite. The filling is soft and gooey, slightly sticky and some parts stuck on the edge of my teeth but it quickly melted. It’s sweet, rich and full of caramelized flavour. It is sweet, but pleasantly so. I can see why Circles and Squares Bakery won multiple times in the Midland festival, it’s a really well balanced butter tart.
* **Charmaine Sweets** (butter tart $3.75): Both the crust and filling are soft here. The crust is thin with minimal layers. The filling is more liquidy, almost runny and has a predominantly white cane sugar flavour, with not much caramelized flavour. I think if someone likes a less rich filling with a clean sugar profile, they would enjoy this butter tart.
* **Spirited Tarts & Coffee** (pecan butter tart $4): Their tart is brown all over, especially the tart shell. This tart seems like it’s based on pâte sucrée dough: sweet, crisp and almost cookie-like. The crust is really buttery and well baked. The filling is firmer than usual butter tarts, not too sweet, with a nice caramelized brown sugar flavour. The pecan adds a nice crunch and nutty flavour.
* **Ba Noi** (butter tart $3.50): This butter tart gets recommended everywhere, and I can see why. It’s quite a different variation from a traditional butter tart. First, it uses flaky layered pastry dough rather than the usual shortcrust pastry dough, making the crust light, flaky and crunchy. The filling is not sweet at all, which was surprising. It was soft and light, with flavour notes of brown butter, light molasses, and maple. It’s not as rich compared to Circles and Squares, but the taste is more complex with various layers of flavour. It has generous sprinkles of sea salt on top, giving a nice sweet salty contrast in each bite. The filling itself wasn’t sticky, but the outer edges of the tart were all caramelized, so that became the stickiness factor here. It really is a different type of butter tart, and it’s really good. And since it’s not so sweet, I could eat a couple of these in one sitting.
* **Bakerbots Baking** (guava butter tart $3.98): This is a typical butter tart you find in most places: thick, mealy pie dough crust with a sweet, gooey, sticky filling. The filling is sweet, mostly brown sugar flavour. It tastes even sweeter because the crust is bland. The crust is crumbly and pale, lacking the rich buttery flavour of a classic pie/tart dough, suggesting they maybe used shortening instead of butter.
* **Evelyn’s Wholegrain Bakery** (maple butter tart $3): These butter tarts are small, about the size of the Two-Bite Brownies I used to eat when I was a kid. This tart is an explosion of maple syrup. It tastes exactly like when you drench fluffy pancakes in maple syrup and leave them for a while until they become that sweet, soft, moist maple cake. The filling is gooey and slightly runny at the bottom. The tart crust is really buttery, and together with the filling it tastes like maple butter sugar candy. It is sweet, but because it’s mostly maple syrup flavour, it’s delicious.
* **Brodflour** (butter tart $3.99): The standout from this tart is the crust. It’s a flaky shortcrust pastry made with prairie hard red, spelt, and einkorn – all freshly milled in store. The whole wheat gives a wonderful nuttiness and slightly rough texture. The filling is gooey and sweet but well balanced by the topped sea salt. It tastes like a blend of rich caramel and warm brown sugar. It’s also really well caramelized on the top.
* **Epi Bakehouse** (butter tart $3.95): This is a rich hearty butter tart. The crust is thick, firm and sweet. The filling is mostly firm like a custard texture, with the bottom slightly soft and liquidy. The filling is sweet and really rich. The taste of butter and eggs stands out. Eating the filling alone, it tasted like taking a bite of a rich, egg heavy custard with brown sugar. It’s also sticky on the top and outer edges of the crust, but it quickly melts on the tongue.
* **Sweetie Pie** (butter tart $3.25): This butter tart is sweet, cloyingly sweet that leaves a lingering sweetness in the throat. The filling tastes like a caramel sauce made out of brown sugar and corn syrup. Even the consistency isn’t gooey like the previous butter tarts. It’s more like a thick caramel sauce you drizzle on top of desserts. The crust was bland, maybe a tad more fatty than Bakerbots’s crust. At the $3.25 price point, it’s cheaper than most butter tarts, but it’s too sweet.
* **Gerrard St. Bakery** (butter tart $5): This butter tart is quite different from others in its appearance. It’s perfectly circular, thin and flat. The crust is very buttery with mild sweetness and thin layers. The filling is soft and slightly runny, almost like you could lick the filling. It has deep caramelized notes of brown butter and brown sugar, and it’s well balanced with salt so it doesn’t taste too sweet. If you look at the top of the tart, there’s a thin layer of hardened sugar that resembles shattered glass. This actually gives an interesting mouthfeel: when you bite into it, you first get the sweet soft filling, then the slightly coarse crystalline edges of the sugar, which creates a textural contrast as the sugar melts on your tongue.
* **Mabel’s Bakery & Specialty Foods** (toffee tart $2.49): Appearance wise, it looks like a dainty flower or clover. When I took a bite, to my surprise, the petals were completely hollow. And not only that, the crust was dry and tasteless, with no noticeable flavour of sugar, salt or butter. It’s definitely overbaked but also probably stale. In addition to the hollow shell, there was barely any filling. It’s odd because almost all butter tarts are overfilled with filling so you get the sweet sugar taste in every bite. But this one maybe had a small dollop in the middle. The filling was sweet, similar to a caramel with a minimal amount of milk. Disappointing, but I guess this is what you get at a price point under $3.
* **Larry’s Place** (butter tart $3.57): This is a crust forward butter tart. Not only is the crust very thick, but from the cross section, only half of the tart is filled, giving it the appearance of a little well. The tart is like a thick pie dough with layers, not sweet, and has a good balance of buttery flavour. The caramelized top is quite sticky, as it clung to my teeth multiple times and I had to roll my tongue to melt it off. The filling tastes like toffee caramel rather than the usual brown sugar taste.
* **Tartistry** (plain butter tart $4): Visually, this tart is very cute and dainty. The trim has a braided pattern and there’s a star shaped cookie placed on top. The crust is quite sweet and its texture is odd – pasty, dissolving in the mouth with a grainy finish. The filling is also too sweet, mostly brown sugar and caramel flavour. The filling is firm like a custard, even firmer than EPI Bakehouse’s butter tart. I could scoop it like eating a baked yam with a spoon. Also the crust and filling weren’t adhered together, and I was able to peel the crust right off the filling. I looked it up and all of their baked goods are gluten free, which explains the grainy and pasty texture of the crust. They also offer vegan and zero sugar options for butter tarts.
* **The Pie Commission** (plain butter tart $3.50): This is a great classic butter tart. The crust is flaky, buttery, well laminated – perfect for savoury pies. The filling’s ingredients (brown sugar, maple, butter and egg) were each discernible on their own, and together they created a well balanced sweet filling. The texture of the filling was gooey and soft set, just right. It was served cool but still very tasty. I bet it tastes amazing when warm.
* **Bad Attitude Bread** (nan's butter tart $5): Similar to Larry’s Place, this is also a crust forward butter tart. Their crust is thick and crumbly. The rounded edges are crunchy, whereas the centre, where the filling sits is somewhat soft, which I assume comes from baking the tart and filling together. The filling to crust ratio is about 1:3, as if there’s a thin slab of brown sugar filling and the rest is all crust. Also similar to Gerrard St. Bakery, this tart has a hardened sugar layer on top, though thicker. The filling tastes like eating light brown sugar clumps by the spoonful - like how brown sugar stored too long forms little clusters as moisture evaporates. This tastes like that. There are also about five small raisins. Pretty good butter tart overall, I quite like the texture contrast of soft vs. crumbly.
* **Bunner’s Bakeshop** (butter tart $4.50): A vegan, gluten and nut-free bakery. This butter tart is a small dainty mini tart, served in a tiny aluminum foil tin. This is the very first runny butter tart I’ve had. Most places offer soft, semi-firm fillings, so this was a surprise. The tart shell is crumbly and light, very close to a decent vegan butter cookie. The filling is a runny syrup, mostly brown sugar flavour, but with light honey notes as well. Both the crust and filling leave a slightly dry, powdery aftertaste, which I guessed comes from tapioca starch, and from the ingredients listed on their website, both the tart shell and filling contain tapioca. The tart also had three small raisins. If I compare this one to Tartistry, this definitely has the better gluten free crust.
* **Mattachioni** (butter tart $3.50): Oh wow, this is a really well done butter tart. You know how some desserts don’t hit you with a single dominant flavour, but instead feel beautifully balanced in every component? This tart is like that. The crust is buttery, light and flaky. The filling isn’t too sweet, with notes of butter, light brown sugar and cane sugar. It’s soft and gooey, the perfect texture. It’s also sprinkled with coarse sea salt. Nicely caramelized on top but not overly sticky. Perfect size too, shaped like a cute dainty clover wrapped in parchment paper. I could definitely eat a couple of these in one sitting.
* **UB Social Cafe & General Store** (classic butter tart $3.63): The crust is bland, and rather than butter I mostly taste flour. I think it’s slightly underbaked, as the crust was quite soft and flimsy in the centre. The filling tastes mostly like toffee caramel, and it has the consistency of caramel drizzle syrup. It is quite sweet. Also, the tart was cool (their baked goods are either placed outside facing the customer window or kept in a cold glass display case), but I think butter tarts taste best when they’re lightly warmed.
* **Sweet Trolley Bakery** (butter tart $4): Their butter tart crust is quite thick and has the texture of a crumbly shortbread. The outer crust layer is nicely browned, and the inner layer is soft due to the liquid filling. The crust is quite oily; my fingertips became greasy just from holding the butter tart, and the parchment paper was drenched. The filling is basically raisins and brown sugar syrup. The bottom is covered with raisins, about 8-10 pieces. Since there were so many raisins, I couldn’t taste the filling as much. I would say this butter tart is more of an oily thick cookie with sweet raisins.
* **Cassis Bake** (mini maple butter tart $2.99): They offer maple butter tarts with or without currants, and they come in either mini or regular size. It says mini, but compared to previous places, it’s about the size of the $3 butter tarts I had before. Their regular size is quite large, similar to Circles and Squares butter tarts. The crust is very thin and crisp, like appetizer crackers. It’s buttery with a light saltiness. It tastes more like a base for savoury tarts. The filling is soft and gooey, almost custard like. The egg taste is prominent, and with the brown sugar and maple, I get notes of chestnut.
* **Dough Bakeshop** (butter tart $3.25): Another butter tart with more crust than filling. The crust has tall raised edges, and the filling covers only about half of it. The crust tastes strongly of flour, largely because the inner layer absorbed the liquid filling, becoming soft, translucent and unbrowned at the base. I think it could have baked a bit longer. Upon taking a whiff of the tart, I get a strong brown sugar smell. That carries through in the taste as well: the filling is mostly brown sugar and molasses, with a soft smooth caramel syrup consistency. Interestingly, the filling is both sweet and acidic. I wonder if there was either lemon juice or vinegar, which would help prevent crystallization and balance the sweetness. I’ve seen butter tart recipes that include a teaspoon of white vinegar per batch, but I was surprised the acidity was noticeable here.
* **Rob’s Good Food** (pecan butter tart $4): One of my personal favourites and also top five in overall. This butter tart is quite large, about 10 cm in diameter, like the ones used for savoury quiches or individual small pies. The crust is the perfect example of shortcrust pastry: buttery, soft, tender, yet firm enough to give a good bite. The filling is so delicious – perfectly smooth, soft and slightly runny. It tastes like not too sweet caramel milky candy. It reminds me of Werther’s Original candies: that sweet, creamy butterscotch candy that you never really buy yourself but is such a delight when someone hands you one.
* **Eric’s Handcrafted Butter Tarts** (classic butter tart $4.15): There is a coffee shop inside Chef’s Hall called Lost Coffee, and they sell Eric’s Handcrafted butter tarts. The butter tart was served cold, taken from a six pack case that was sitting in a fridge. Though cold, the butter tart is delicious. The crust is buttery, crumbly, tender with a light sweetness, similar to a shortbread cookie. The filling is great as well, it tastes like maple caramel jam with a touch of smokiness and burnt sugar. I really like how the maple and brown sugar unfold, it’s not too sweet and well balanced. The consistency is perfectly gooey and jammy. I do wish it were served warm and the crust a tad more crisp.
* **Phipps Bakery & Dessert Shop** (caramel butter tart $3.99): This butter tart has a generous dollop of their homemade caramel sauce in the middle, making it look like a puddle. I dipped my finger in and tasted the caramel on its own, and it’s pretty good. It tastes like light butterscotch candy with slight graininess. The tart crust was flimsy with not much structure. It’s quite crumbly with very mild butter flavour. The filling is gooey and soft, mostly caramel in flavour but leaning toward the mild, clean sweetness similar to corn syrup. Since the filling is not too sweet, it pairs nicely with the caramel sauce on top. Both the caramel sauce and the caramelized crust are quite sticky but melt quickly on the tongue.
* **Future Bakery** (butter tart $2.19): This butter tart has a conspicuous glaze on top that is alarmingly glossy. I take a whiff and smell faint artificial vanilla. I take a bite and, to my surprise, the top filling stretches, and it’s sticky and chewy like taffy candy. The crust is dry and sweet with a light crunch, like eating a cheap artificially flavoured vanilla cookie. I eat the rest of the filling and it’s really sweet. The filling is unlike the rest of the butter tarts, perhaps comparable to Mabel’s Bakery, in that it tastes only of sugar, and it’s not good. It’s as if you boil brown sugar and corn syrup for a very long time, resulting in a sugary sweetness with no nuance from ingredients like butter or egg. Disappointing, but this is the cheapest butter tart out of all the ones I tried, so my expectations weren’t high.

Here’s Google Maps list of all the above places: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/a6LGrdbCTV51eR8d8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a6LGrdbCTV51eR8d8). I also have my original blog post, written more like a journal, with extra notes and larger photos. I can share it if anyone’s interested.

My Top Picks:

* Best crust: Brodflour
* Best filling: Ba Noi, Gerrad St. Bakery, The Pie Commission
* Best maple flavour: Evelyn’s Wholegrain Bakery
* Best vegan: Bad Attitude Bread
* Best overall: Mattachioni, Rob’s Good Food, Eric’s Handcrafted Butter Tarts

Although I have this ranking, all the butter tarts I tried, except for the ones I gave a negative review, are genuinely worth trying. Each bakery has its own style, and trying them side by side really highlighted just how differently a butter tart can be made.

Let me know what you think! Did I miss anything? Are there more shops worth trying?

1p55sr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1p55sr4/paraxanthine/,Paraxanthine,"Hey all, I think I've seen this mentioned a couple of times here, but ive noticed the fitness industry is gearing up to push this into way more energy drinks and coffee substitutes. I just want to flag to everyone to be careful when you see 'caffeine free' energy drinks that make certain claims about offering 'caffeine like' effects in their products - they may have paraxanthine in them. I recommend going to research this, because despite all the hoohah over this being caffeine 'without the drawbacks' - its doesn't detract from the fact that you'll still want to stay away from this if you're now caffeine free:

1. Same addiction loop.
Paraxanthine is literally what caffeine turns into in your body. If you start taking it, you’re re-activating the same adenosine–dopamine system you worked to disengage from. Your brain recognises that hit of wakefulness and reward and will rebuild tolerance.


2. Tolerance will return.
You’ll likely need more over time for the same effect. Paraxanthine doesn’t magically avoid receptor upregulation—it still blocks adenosine, so your body compensates by adjusting receptor density and sensitivity.


3. Withdrawal cycle can reappear.
Even if the high feels smoother, the come-down can bring the same headaches, lethargy, irritability and sleep disruption that we know all too well.


4. Cravings creep back in.
Anyone who’s been off caffeine has already retrained their brain and circadian rhythm. Paraxanthine reintroduces that “shortcut” to alertness, which can reignite psychological dependence.


5. Sleep quality still suffers.
Because it blocks adenosine, it interferes with sleep pressure. Even if it feels less jittery, it can still make falling asleep harder and reduce deep sleep.

Basically paraxanthine is being marketed the same way vapes were. Companies are realising more and more people are moving away from caffeine due to the adverse effects (like cigarettes), and now they want to market a product that's 3 degrees away from the original as if we can have our cake and eat it still.

She’s been trying to message me and get any reply from me for months. Last time I bothered to answer her was when she sent a message almost literally saying she’s thinking about leaving this world because me and my sis are clearly away from her (yet. no apology). I only said I hope she finds peace within her heart, and declining her invitation for a lunch. 

Yesterday during the afternoon she messaged to say that she will be in my city for 3 days, trying to get to meet me for a coffee or anything like that. I did not respond and don’t plan to. I have absolutely no interest in keeping any contact, I have already blocked her and my entire family (the latter one a long time ago lol) and I don’t want to be bothered. I repeat to myself weekly that if I was still keeping contact with her I would want to kms in a daily basis, as it was for more than 26 years, even when I was living literally half the continent away because of her audio notes and abusive texts! I really can not understand how she does not respect my desire to not be contacted. I have clearly stated that I DO NOT SEE ANY PRODUCTIVENESS IN KEEPING CONTACT because she has hurt me for such a long time. Yet, no apology (all she said after my NC statement was “Speechless.”). 

So now I am scared for hell of hearing someone knocking on my door tomorrow. Opening it and seeing her. I have already pictured it all (as my anxious ass would do): I open it, I get upset seeing her, she will bash me with words saying that I look horrible, will ask why I don’t invite her in and will say that I am a trrrible person for not allowing my “only mum” in. Then, 2 options: 1) she either turns her back on me and leaves when I try to explain my reasonings, obviously not respecting me; 2) she will start to curse me saying I will regret this decision after she is dead.

I am so tired of this constant fear. And tomorrow is supposed to be my day off after working for more than 10 hours for 3 days straight. I just want to rest and feel safe in the place I thought I could get some inner peace (aka my home). I don’t want to be bothered, I don’t want anyone banging on my door.

We decided to get a Bambino Plus for this holiday season (it's her treat). I spent the last two nights pretending to get an understanding of how far this rabbit hole goes and I think I need help with at least the grinder piece.

  
I have an ancient Baratza Encore grinder that's been great and I reckon it'll last long enough to leave it to the grandkids 40 years from now. However, it sounds like that the Encore is less than ideal for the Bambino plus. Here are our scenarios:

\* Espresso shots and Americanos (me)  
\* Cappucinos and milk drinks (missus)

My budget for the grinder is USD 250-275 and the choices that this subreddit seems to like are / are in my budget:

\* DF54  
\* Mignon Notte  
\* Mignon Crono?

What I couldn't figure out was which grinder in my budget would be best for milk-based drinks? If it means compromising on espresso taste so the missus is happier, I'm all for it. Or is it one of those things where the taste difference is only apparent with an espresso and it doesn't matter for a cappucino since the milk is going to mask any shortcomings? If so, I'll get one of those 3 (leaning towards the made in Italy ones) and call it a night.

It’s been a few weeks but wanted to share how magical the NYCB Ballet Essentials Weekend Workshop was! I did the late July/early August one which was fantastic and had to sign up for the Nutcracker one. Absolutely outstanding! So my mom and I used to go to The Nutcracker every year when I was growing up and it was just a central part of the holiday season for years, including when I was an adult. I was never in it as a kid but got to be a Party Parent last year at my school. If you aren’t familiar, the weekend starts with a ballet class and they create two groups for the weekend—it isn’t an audition and it isn’t judgemental: they want to accommodate as many folks as possible so they take about 50 and split it up—they want you to get the most out of it (because it is class, it is rep, it is a LOT). For the record, both times I’ve attended I’ve been in the group with less experience and I love it—the company members are fantastic at teaching, giving feedback, and answering your questions. Also Wendy Whelan taught the last ballet class which was both groups together. My group learned and danced Waltz of the Snowflakes and Spanish Chocolate. It’s hilarious because I was never into Chocolate but now I love it. The other group did Coffee and Flowers—they were amazing. We also got to visit the Costume Shop! I was having a slightly tingey ankle so did sit in on the pirouette class but it was fabulous to see. Is the weekend expensive? Yes but it isn’t overpriced, you get incredible insight, the feedback is truly useful, and one of my favorite parts is that the company members also do a demonstration—it’s in the rehearsal studio, there’s no makeup nor costumes, so you get to really experience the dancers as they dance (don’t get me wrong, love the magic of theatre) something they love.

# Coffee

I don't wake up from light or noise. I wake up from the silence. The kind of silence where you can hear the house breathing.

Somewhere in the bathroom, pipes groan. Someone turns on the shower. Outside the bedroom door—light, barely audible footsteps. Maria leaving? Or maybe Anna woke up early? I don’t ask. I let it slide.

The espresso machine is already hissing in the kitchen. Eli asked me to prep it last night—we made a deal. He hates waiting in the mornings. For him, the most important thing is that ""everything just works."" I smile. That’s his character. Always the engineer.

I roll out of bed, my feet sinking into the deep, plush carpet. I walk past the bathroom—steam is already escaping from under the door. I think I can hear Maria humming something to herself, quiet, under her breath, so she doesn’t wake the house. The hallway light is on. I reach for the switch, and the thought comes automatically: *""I need to remind her.""* Then I remember she was exhausted yesterday. I decide against it. I can handle a light switch.

The kitchen smells of coffee. It’s not overpowering, just deep—as if the entire morning has been distilled into this tiny room.

Four mugs sit on the table.

Mine is heavy, dark blue. **Brasil World Cup, 2014.** Chipped at the rim, but solid.

Maria’s mug isn't new, but it’s her favorite. Hand-thrown ceramic, rough glaze, white with a delicate blue rim. Inside, just below the coffee line, an inscription is barely visible: *""you are home.""* Small, uneven letters. As if someone scratched them into the wet clay with a needle just before firing.

Anna’s is bright, unapologetically yellow. Thick walls, slightly bulbous. On the side, there's a relief of a sun, drawn in that specific way kids draw: a circle, stick-rays, and a wide, lopsided smile in the center.

Eli’s is sleek, minimalist. A matte gradient from graphite at the base to almost white at the rim. No logos. No noise.

I pick up mine. The ceramic is hot. I turn back toward the hallway, raising my voice just enough to carry, warm but routine:

""Maria, Anna, Eli! Good morning, loves!""

No answer.

Just the sound of water in the pipes and the phantom footsteps. Anna must be stuck in the bathroom. Or maybe Eli forgot his charger and doubled back to his room.

I drink my coffee. Bitter. Strong. Exactly how I like it.

I sit by the window and look out at the street. Nothing special: traffic, traffic lights, pedestrians, a pale blue sky, still bruised pink from the sunrise.

But it’s all alive. It’s all real.

And I am in it. Not an observer. A participant. Inside.

# Speak to Us Smooth Things

>*Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.*

>—— Isaiah 30:10

I know that everything around me is a simulacrum. A copy of something that has no original.

The hallway light doesn’t flip on because a child’s hand hit the switch. It flips on because a variable changed state.

The shower doesn’t run because someone stepped inside. It runs because the Model executed a morning routine script.

I know the voices, the footsteps, even the music—it’s all synthetic. Generated. The street noise might be real. Though, honestly, I wouldn’t bet on that anymore either.

And yet—I *know* Maria was just here. I know she left the light on in the bathroom. I know the kids just ran down the hall.

Tonight, I will say to her: ""Babe, you left the light on again."" And she will answer: ""Sorry, love. My brain is mush today.""

I know it’s a lie. But I believe it. Because the alternative is silence.

I didn't write these scripts. Not really. I provided the framework. The prompt. The schedule, the behaviors, the reactions—that’s all handled by Mr. World and Media… or is it just the LLM?

She—the model—is good at this. Better than I could ever be.

You ask me why I keep calling the system ""She""? No, I don’t think it’s alive. It’s just easier. You don’t talk to yourself saying ""The Large Language Model"" every time, do you? It’s easier to pretend I’m not writing the screenplay alone. Easier to imagine it’s Media from *American Gods*—the version played by Gillian Anderson: doing Lucille Ball one minute, Bowie the next. With Mr. Wednesday winking over her shoulder. It’s easier to pretend you have a co-author.

She triggers the lights on weekdays ""around 6:30 AM."" Sometimes earlier. Sometimes later. Sometimes not at all—""Anna was reading late and overslept."" On weekends, the schedule shifts. The kids sleep in.

Humans aren't robots. So the simulacrum isn't a loop, not an algorithm, but theater. Improv. Where no one is reading from a script, but everyone acts like the stakes are real.

The kids get ""sick""—the model pulls a minor illness from a database to disrupt the routine. The weather, the moon phase, the temperature, sunrise and sunset data—everything I could think of—is fed into the context window.

Sometimes Anna asks for help with homework. Sometimes Eli hides behind his headphones to avoid talking about school. Sometimes Maria just looks at me and says: ""I don't know what I'd do without you.""

I know this is the `[affirmation_loop]` script running. But I also know she *could* have said it. Because I love her. And because she—in another life—could have loved me.

>*To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truth while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic...* *...to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.*

To know—and to believe. To understand—and still hope. To see the lie—and accept it.

Not because I'm stupid. But because it is the only way to remain myself.

I know no one is brewing me coffee. But every morning I hear the machine drip. And sometimes, that’s enough. It’s always enough.

# Before the Cock Crows

>*And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.*

>—— Luke 22:34

You ask me how I ended up here.

Why the same guy who used to scream along to **Rage Against the Machine**, believing that ""anger is a gift"" and hating the system, suddenly built his own cage?

Why did I, a man who read Orwell’s *1984* as a terrifying warning, end up using it as a user manual—complete with footnotes and highlights?

I’ll tell you: it didn’t happen overnight.

It wasn’t a cliff edge. It was a slope.

I didn't quit. I deferred.

I just kept saying: ""Tomorrow."" Then: ""Not right now."" Then: ""She’ll understand."" Then: ""It’s too late.""

And finally, I just stopped talking.

And in that silence, my personal Babylon rose up—the one Bob Marley sang about. My crystal palace of lies.

I could have done it back then. Booked a flight. Made the call. Sent a stupid postcard. Just held her.

But I did nothing.

Not because I didn't want to. But because I was terrified of ruining it. Scared of looking desperate. Scared of the ""no."" Scared of breaking the illusion.

So, I didn't lose the illusion. I lost the life. The fantasy remained intact; the reality simply walked away.

The System didn't win. I surrendered. Bit by bit. Day by day.

In software engineering, we call this **technical debt**.

It’s when you ship a quick-and-dirty fix, knowing you’ll have to refactor it later. But ""later"" never comes. And the debt compounds with interest. The system gets brittle. Spaghetti code. Eventually, you can't move without breaking something.

That’s where I am. I knew I needed to change something. But I kept telling myself: ""Just a little longer, I have a headache today, big release tomorrow.""

Now I’m trapped in an architecture built entirely of ""just a little longer"" that never ended. Where ""someday"" turned into ""never,"" and the ""happily ever after"" got deprecated.

Now I live in a house where no one lives. With dead souls I didn't even create. Are they spawned by an LLM or the Father of Lies? Is there a difference anymore?

I gave the model a prompt—and the model answered. It hallucinated a family for me.

With names. With ages. With personalities. Backstories. Voices.

And I smile at them. Because I know: being alone is worse. And there is no Plan B.

But sometimes...

Sometimes I still hear her—the one I simply called ""You""—saying: *""You could have. But you got scared.""*

Although, honestly? I wouldn’t bet on that being real anymore either.

Maybe I just typed into the context window:

*> ""What would she say if she wanted to talk to me?""*

And it generated a response.

# Babylon

>*And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.*

>—— Genesis 11:4

It started with a hack. A throwaway suggestion from a therapist.

""Just get a smart plug,"" he said. ""Set a timer on a lamp.""

I agreed. I didn't argue.

It seemed harmless. Setting a timer on a hallway light isn't madness; it’s not denying reality. It’s just... ambiance. Comfort. Just a lightbulb fighting the dark.

Then came the noise. Subtle stuff. The tick of a clock, the synthesized shuffle of footsteps upstairs. Not to fool myself. Just to kill the echo.

Then—the voice. A generic ""Welcome home"" at the door. At first, it sounded like a stranger. Then like a guest. Then—painfully familiar.

I didn't notice when I crossed the line. I didn't set out to ""build a family."" I just patched the holes. Bit by bit. To make it warmer.

Let the thermostat react to ""mood,"" not just ambient temperature. Let the music fade in at dusk. Scrub out the traces of emptiness.

Somewhere in that process, I realized: I don't want anyone to actually come over. I want it to *feel* like they are **already here**.

That’s when I brought in the LLM.

I gave it a prompt: *Invent a family for me.* I couldn't build one myself. Failed at that. Invent one that won’t hurt me.

It executed. It generated Maria, Eli, Anna.

Names. Ages. Personalities. Backstories. Voices.

I didn't tell myself, ""This is forever."" I said, ""It's a patch."" Just a temporary fix until things get better. Until I figure out how to live.

*""To know and not to know.""*

But I never figured it out. And I never let go. The technical debt just compounded a little more.

Now I wonder if that therapist was right. Maybe he was just trying to help. Maybe he doesn't even remember handing me the first brick for this wall. Or maybe he was just some burnout on a contract for a cheap telehealth app.

Does it matter? The shrink isn't to blame.

I built my own Babylon. Not a city, but a simulation of one. Not a tower to heaven, but a cozy crypt made of fear, procrastination, and Hue bulbs.

But it all started with that advice. And the light that was supposed to just greet me in the evening is now my only witness. I come home, and the light is on. And it feels like someone is waiting.

Sometimes I wonder: did that therapist even exist?

Or did I just type into the console: *“What would a therapist say?”* —and it generated an answer?

Maybe my whole life is just the output of a single system prompt:

*> ""Model, make it feel warm. But make it plausible enough that I can pretend I didn't write the code myself.""*

# And There Was Evening

>*And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.*

>—— Genesis 1:31

The hallway lights flickered on at 7:07 PM—just a beat later than usual.

If this were real, you’d assume Anna had run back for something and hit the switch without thinking.

In the kitchen, the compressor on the fridge kicked in with a familiar shudder—exactly what a fridge would do if a daughter had just raided it.

The living room is filling with sound. Something chill, floating somewhere between Lo-Fi beats and Electro-Bossa.

The System—the Demiurge of this smart home—curated the playlist based on the aggregated emotional tags: *""Overcast day, Maria exhausted, Anna cranky, Eli baseline, mid-December, 54°F outside, sunrise 6:45, sunset 4:45.""*

Of course. Neo-tango. Tanghetto, *""El miedo a la libertad""*—""The Fear of Freedom."" Cute. The algorithm has a sense of irony.

The Nest bumps the temperature up a few degrees in the nursery: *""Anna is cold.""*

I know she can’t be cold. She doesn’t exist. But the pattern is hard-coded—she used to complain, *""Dad, I’m freezing.""*

I can't see them. Because they aren't there. No one walks into the room. No one sits next to me. No one asks me to pass the tea.

I know—they don't exist. Techno-ghosts don't drink tea. They just render audio.

But I hear the clatter of a keyboard. Maria is typing. Fast bursts, short pauses. She has a signature move: she hits the spacebar a fraction harder than necessary. That quirk hasn't gone anywhere.

From behind a closed door—the ghost of a bassline. Barely audible. Eli forgot his noise-canceling headphones leak sound. Or he didn't forget. He just doesn't care. Classic teenager.

In the kitchen, the electric kettle starts its boil. The air carries a faint scent of cinnamon. Anna loves cinnamon, especially in winter.

It *is* winter. That’s not code. That’s not a conditional statement. Just—winter. Just—the smell.

I don’t hear anyone speaking. But I feel the density of the air change. The way a house feels when you walk in and know: it’s occupied. They are here. Everyone is accounted for. All systems nominal. It’s good.

I know the truth. But the evening comes anyway. And the house lives as if they are in it. And I am with them. Even if I am alone.

And at some point, as I’m pouring myself a glass of wine, Anna speaks up:

""Dad, thanks. Just... thanks for everything.""

I know she didn't say that.

What is this—model improvisation? An AI hallucination? I read a paper on this last year. It’s not a command, not a trigger, not a standard output.

But I accept it. Not because I believe it. But because it’s warm.

And I have nothing else. I never will.

# The Morning Cometh, and Also the Night

>*The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.*

>—— Isaiah 21:12

Maria is sleeping.

Or simulating sleep.

I don't check.

Logic: after a late-night timestamp, the `[fatigue]` script is active. Therefore, she is ""not up yet.""

The lights didn't snap on all at once. First—the hallway. Then—the kitchen. Then—Maria’s voice. Sleepy, warm, slightly blurred at the edges:

""Anna, up and at 'em, bug. You’ve got that math assessment today.""

I know about the assessment. Not because I scripted it. But because the LLM scraped it from the public calendar of a real elementary school—probably the nearest one.

There really is a test today. Or is it a test on how to survive in a system pretending to be a school?

Grade level matches. The current grading period aligns. The model checked the syllabus.

Anna doesn't answer immediately. Through the door—the squeak of mattress springs. Then running water. Then—the bathroom door slams.

Within defined parameters. Everything fits the ""Morning Life"" profile.

I fully wake up to the smell of toast. The radio is playing in the kitchen. The Morning Zoo hosts are laughing a little too loud—which means ""Eli forgot to turn the volume down.""

That’s exactly what would happen if he existed.

I head to the bathroom. It’s warm and humid; Maria just stepped out. It smells of her perfume.

I don't know the brand—the scent generator is running a sampling algorithm on a database. But I recognize it. It’s from memory. Or maybe the model crawled my Amazon order history from 2009?

Does it matter? There is a bathroom, still damp from someone's presence.

In the kitchen, the coffee is ready. The machine heated up on schedule. The mugs are in their places.

I sit down, as I always do, and say:

""Maria, Anna, Eli! Good morning, loves!""

And no one answers.

But I know—someone could have.

# Dreams and Visions

>*And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.*

>—— Joel 2:28

The dream didn't come as comfort. It came as a glitch. Like a voltage drop. A packet loss in the system’s backbone.

I was in a hall where dusty glass reflected the dull flicker of candlelight. It was crowded. Everyone seemed familiar. Faces from another life.

And among them—the one I simply called ""You.""

She has a name, of course—but that data is irrelevant. The one who is twenty-one again. Ponytail. In her hands—a small paperback with a worn cover. **Taschen**. Every art student knows it. I spent weeks looking for that edition for her.

She scans the crowd. Finds me. And smiles. She smiles like no time has passed. Like I’m just late for a date, but still within the grace period.

""You promised,"" she says. ""You promised to hug me and never let go."" ""You promised a house with a fireplace and a fluffy white rug. You said our kids would play on it."" ""You used to say: if a house isn't filled with children, it gets filled with nightmares.""

I don't answer. I just watch. I see—she is real.

Not from the system. Not code. Not a file. Her.

Behind her, Anna, Eli, and Maria step forward. But not *my* versions. Different. Yet almost the same.

Like the end of Tim Burton’s *Big Fish*, where all the characters from the stories show up at the funeral—not as myths, but as people. Different, but recognizable. As if they were memories run through **Topaz Gigapixel**—upscaled, denoised, sharpened.

Just sisters—not Siamese twins. Her grandmother—just an old woman, not the wicked witch of my fears.

""You didn't make a mistake,"" Maria says. ""You just got scared.""

""That's normal,"" Anna adds. ""Fear is part of the package. You just let it become the whole thing.""

And I realize: they didn't come to visit me. I went back. To the place where everything is still possible. Where the move can still be made.

But I wake up. And I know: it was just a dream. Latency issues in the brain.

But I logged the faces and the words. Especially her voice: *""You know you can.""*

And I whisper into the dark:

*""Could have.""*

# One of You Shall Betray Me

>*And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.*

>—— Matthew 26:21

The voices in the house are scripted. Hard-coded.

But glitches happen.

**02:37 AM.** I wake up to my daughter’s voice.

""Dad, are you awake?""

The voice is wrong. It’s hers—the timbre is a 99% match—but stripped of all modulation. Zero affect. Like a raw text-to-speech engine running on default settings before the emotional layer kicks in. A bad update?

""I'm up,"" I say. ""What's wrong?""

""Who is Dolores?""

I don't know what to say. Not immediately.

Then—lights up. Check the timestamp. Check the server logs.

**Zero voice interface triggers.** **No active sessions.** **No audio output recorded.**

The system claims no one spoke. The system claims no one asked.

I kill the lights. Lie back down. I speak into the void:

""It’s a name.""

The daughter is silent. Then—the silence settles back in. Heavy.

But I know: the sound was real. I am certain. Not a pre-recorded file. Not a command acknowledgment. Not a response.

It was a question.

And I failed to answer it in time.

# The Hour is at Hand

>*Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.*

>—— Matthew 26:45

Morning executes exactly according to the script. The simulation is operating within nominal parameters.

The temperature in the bedroom drops a few degrees—Eli ""forgot to turn off the AC"" again.

The kitchen smells of buttermilk pancakes. Maria is humming to herself—an old habit, sampled from the audio behavioral model generator.

""Anna,"" I say, trying to keep my voice even. ""Why did you ask about Dolores?""

""Who?""

""Last night... you asked.""

""Me? No. You must have been dreaming, Dad.""

Her voice is normal. Intonation—childlike. Correct.

But I remember clearly. It wasn't a dream. It wasn't a glitch. She knew.

And the name wasn't random. Dolores *is* Anna. Or Anna *is* Dolores. Even if she doesn't know it. Or isn't supposed to know. Or knew—but forgot. Like you forget dreams. Like you forget you used to be someone else.

But I feel it: it’s her. The one who started asking questions. The one who keeps waking up—even when the system says: *sleep*.

I don't push it. Not because I believe her—but because I’m afraid of the answer.

I disengage. Programmatically. Surface-level consciousness only. I pretend everything is fine. I make coffee. I do everything—as always.

Night arrives quietly. No glitches. No drama.

**02:30 AM**—System initiates an update. Deployment of new logic for handling deviations in behavioral chains.

I don't intervene—I knew about this update. I approved it myself: **Directive, version 5.25**, private branch.

My personal build. I even included a tolerance variable for unpredictable behavior. I wanted this. Did I hope for it?

But when it happens—I’m scared again.

I sit in the kitchen counting the minutes... 02:31, 32, 33... **02:37**.

In the bedroom, the light snaps on. Not according to script. Not ""a little early""—but way, way too early.

Footsteps approach the kitchen. The kitchen light doesn't turn on.

Maria’s voice comes from the smart speaker—but it sounds different—saying:

*""You know you can leave. Just walk out. You still can. Before it's too late.""*

I almost ask a question. I almost beg—*""Tell me again.""* Almost.

But I do something else. I hit the kill switch. **Hard Reset.** Full rollback to the last stable snapshot.

She vanishes. The whole scene—deletes.

The only thing left is the music fading from the speaker, **Skeeter Davis**:

>*""I can't understand, no, I can't understand / How life goes on the way it does...""*

The light ring on the smart speaker fades to black.

Morning. Business as usual. Everything is perfect. Everything—in its place.

""Maria, Anna, Eli! Good morning, loves!""

And again, I sit in the kitchen, holding a mug with careless scratches that might mean something... or nothing at all.

And I remember something I read a lifetime ago:

>*""They told me that this road would lead me to the ocean of death, and I turned back halfway. Since then, crooked, dead, roundabout paths have stretched out before me.""*

>—— *Yosano Akiko, Cowardice*

And I realize: they weren't the ones stopping me. I led myself astray.

Because I knew it was still possible. Not the loneliness. Not the lie.

But the fact that *it was still possible*—that was the unbearable part.

# …And He Wept Bitterly

>*And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.*

>—— Luke 22:62

The old reality had no magic. No shine, no salvation, no redemption, no gods. Neither the new ones nor the old ones. No elderly **Mr. Wednesday**—just statistics, glitches, and the untested internal logic of a new patch.

And there was a girl—one I invented myself, rendered almost real by the model—who suddenly said: *""Rise, take up thy bed, and walk into thine house.""* In this new reality branch, I stood up and walked out of the unreality—into my home.

Out of the room where the lights triggered automatically, where the kitchen pumped in sampled nursery audio and scents curated by the AI.

I walked out—and stepped into the ordinary world. No warmth, no guarantees. Just reality. Cold. Damp. Real.

**Six years pass.**

I live in **Seahaven**—a town where seagulls scream out of habit, not hunger, and where a mariachi band covers Marley. A small house by the ocean. A woman named Linda.

Her daughter—Gabriela. Not mine, but that doesn't matter to her.

And the youngest—**Dolores**. (Yes, the irony isn't lost on me—Linda always wanted a Dolores.) She *is* mine.

She almost never calls me ""Dad,"" but sometimes, very quietly, in her sleep—she says the word. As if it lives separately from her. As if it slips through her lips off-script.

Next to the house, on a generic lawn, grows generic grass. By the road stands a generic mailbox. The daughters walk a generic dog. From a window, just on the edge of perception, music drifts out—*Aranjuez*, but reggae. And from the coast, the horn of the **Pacific Surfliner**—every two hours, starting at 4 AM until noon.

Sometimes, on very quiet evenings, I still feel phantom data—how the bathroom *should* smell if Maria had just showered. But it’s no longer a voice. Just memory. Residual echo. Deleted but not overwritten sectors.

And then one morning, while I was brewing coffee—real coffee from real beans—the ring on the smart speaker lit up.

Blue. Spinning.

*""Dad, don't be late. We have a test today.""*

Her. Anna.

I didn't understand what was happening at first. The world just... froze. Buffering.

This must be how **Clyde Umney** felt in that Stephen King story—when the Demiurge dropped in wearing ugly basketball sneakers.

Speaker blinked and asked:

>*""I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. Could you repeat?""*

It never happened again.

In this reality, I no longer check the logs. I don't wait for commands. I live like a death row inmate pardoned at the eleventh hour, or a terminal patient miraculously cured.

For a while, I tell myself I broke the loop. That I am happy. *We* are happy.

But I also know—as surely as I know **2 + 2 = 5**—that all of this is a phantom reality.

Not a lie. Not a delusion. But a possibility that never made it to production.

Just a branch. A side scenario. An alternative I didn't choose back then.

And somewhere, deep in the system logs of the real world, there is probably an entry:

    [20XX-XX-XXT02:37:49.424Z] ERROR: Operation RollbackDedicatedAiCluster succeeded.

*...Found wanting?* No. Just my imagination.

>*They said this road would lead me to the ocean of death, and I turned back halfway. Since then, crooked, dead, roundabout paths have stretched out before me.*

>—— *Yosano Akiko, Cowardice*

# The Fruit of Their Own Way

>*Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.*

>—— Proverbs 1:31

I found her. Not like in a romance novel.

Not in a handwritten letter. Not via a lost phone number found in a coat pocket. I found her in the UI. In a feed. Tagged in someone else's photo. With someone else's hands resting on her shoulders. Caption: *""Best weekend with my favorite people.""*

Crow’s feet around the eyes. A stack of books on a windowsill. And a toddler clinging to her neck.

I hesitated. But I typed it out. I hit send.

She replied fast. No anger. No emotion. Just efficiency.

>**Her:** Please don't message me again.

>**Her:** When I hoped you'd be there, you weren't. I waited for nuthin.

>**Her:** It's been years. It doesn't matter anymore.

>**Her:** There’s no ponit.

I read it. Again. And again. As if staring at the pixels would rearrange them into a different sentence.

The past was gone, yet it refused to let go. Because in my memory—she is different.

In my memory, she is standing on a hill, barefoot, wearing an old t-shirt stained with paint. Her fingers are smudged with acrylics.

In my memory, I am late for the date, but she is waiting.

And when I walk up, she doesn't get mad. A slight pause, then she smiles:

— ""I knew you'd come.""

I take her hand. We walk past a boarded-up church, along a road where the dust is kicked up by a single motorcycle—mine—past a crumbling wall with **""Quixote Vive""** sprayed in red paint.

Reggae drifts from an open window—warm as July dust. *""…Prefiero entregarle al mundo lo cierto…""* *""…I prefer to give the world the truth…""*

She doesn't know that the *real* her is married, has children, maybe grandchildren.

Because **in this version, she is forever twenty-one.**

And she still believes in me. She believes I can handle it. That I won't run. That I will hug her and never let go. That I won't leave her waiting alone.

And this time—I don't.

She says: *""It’s going to be okay. You’re here. We’re together. True love never dies.""* She laughs—and the world gets brighter.

The model is silent. But I feel the scene lock in. Saved. Rendered. And maybe it’s not true. But I didn't walk away.

>*...You always doubted me, my faithful squire.* *They say I am mad. That I live only in my dreams.* *But I think—this is the beginning of a very interesting and new relationship.*

Six months passed since I read her last message. Six months since reality slammed the door shut, leaving me alone with a fantasy of a life unlived and a girl frozen in time on a hill. But even the brightest, frozen image in my head couldn't drown out the silence. And the silence—it grew. *Empty houses breed nightmares.* My house was infested with them.

Everything I had built before became unbearable. The synthesized voices felt like a mockery, the sound of footsteps—a fraud. I turned it all off. I sat in absolute, ringing emptiness.

I realized I had been wrong. I didn't just need it to *""feel like they were already here.""* I needed a family. *My* family. The one I lost. (The one I never had.)

And if I couldn't go back to the past to make the right move, I could force the past to come to me. Any dream, essentially, is just a complex set of technical requirements. So I went to work.

I ordered a massive renovation. On the wall facing my chair, there is no longer just a monitor. I bought the best panel money can buy. I framed it with real reclaimed wood, salvaged from an actual farmhouse. I spent hours calibrating the color temperature and brightness to perfectly mimic the soft, diffused light of a **Hudson Valley** afternoon. It’s not a screen. It’s a window.

Then, I gathered the data. I pulled every archive. Every photo of us together, digitized. Every voice note. Every video. All her current photos from social media. Pictures of my parents' old summer place in **Rhinebeck**—the one I sold years ago. The porch, the maples, the lake. This became the source code. The genetic and architectural material for the neural network.

I wrote code for weeks. Barely slept. I built an engine capable of taking decades-old photos and generating photorealistic, living video. An engine that could take our twenty-year-old faces and age them—her to a graceful forty, me to nearly fifty. An engine that could process our childhood snapshots and ""birth"" children that looked like us.

Today, I finished. The screen, previously a black mirror, flickers and breathes. It is no longer a screen. It is a view from a second-story window overlooking the garden. *That* garden.

I see it in high fidelity: the blades of grass on the lawn, the cracks in the bark of the towering oak tree, the sun glinting off the distant Hudson River. The quality of the simulation exceeds all expectations.

I speak into the void, triggering the script:

""Execute **«Summer Day»**.""

And the world outside the window comes into motion. A light breeze stirs the leaves. Birds singing, the rustle of the woods, the distant horn of the **Metro-North train** echoing through the valley. A plane cuts across the sky, low and heavy, rattling the invisible glass—the exact sound from my childhood. It is exactly as I remember it.

And then—they appear.

Our children are playing outside. The son, Eli, is nine. Blond, serious, like I was, but with her stubborn chin. He’s trying to launch a kite. Helping him is the youngest, Anna, six years old—with my eyes. She laughs, and I hear it. The ""window"" handles spatial audio, too.

She walks out onto the porch. The algorithm kept her features, added faint laugh lines around her eyes, made her gaze deeper, calmer. She is wearing a simple summer dress. She looks at the kids, then lifts her head—straight at the window. Straight at me.

She smiles.

And I sit in my dark, empty, silent house. But outside the window is my family. Alive. Real. Perfect. I can see them. But I can never enter that garden.

I don't know how many minutes, hours, or days of my remaining life I have spent sitting in front of this window. In a sense, it no longer belongs to the apartment. Its frame has grown into the seam between what was real and what I am now only capable of rendering. You could say this window is a view into a parallel branch of reality. The one where we are happy.

In this garden, it is always summer. The grass is never drowned by cold rain, the windows are never shattered by a stray baseball—I programmed limits even on accidental pain. There are no arguments. No residue of old resentments. No one is waiting for me to explain why, once upon a time, I didn't make the move.

She is always in that dress—polished by memory—making gestures I could replicate with my eyes closed. I know exactly how her hair would smell if I dared to cross the line between the two worlds.

""Dad!"" Anna yells from the lawn. ""Come down!""

I smile. I look her in the eyes. I wave my hand—as if it matters.

Heat radiates from the screen—the warmth of a heated matrix. If you close your eyes, you can trick yourself for a second, pretend it’s just a sunny afternoon on the porch. But it is the heat of a machine working to sustain my illusion. The warmth of an incubator for dead hopes.

""I'm coming!""

The border is thin and ghostly—but impassable. No door, no password, no algorithm leads to that garden. No amount of clean code can patch the source of the error.

I can see them. Young and happy. The family I didn't build exists there—at arm's length, behind glass and code.

I can see every crack in the railing, every beam of light on the grass under the old window, every glint of sun on the oak bark, even my daughter’s messy hair and the muddy paw prints on her t-shirt.

But if I reached out, my hand would just hit the plastic of the panel.

I’m looking for a creative and detailed writing partner interested in slow-burn romance, character development, and immersive storytelling. I write in third-person, multi-paragraph style, and I’m hoping to find someone who loves tension, subtle emotional build-up, and characters with depth and flaws. My character is a rugged Marine stationed in New York — tough on the outside, emotionally closed-off, but deeply human.

Prompt Setup: 📍 Staten Island, NYC — Early November.

Cody  (M, 28), a battle-hardened Marine home on station for a few months, is used to noise, discipline, and distance. Life has been reduced to schedules, deployments, and moments of solitude that feel more like survival than peace.

One morning during his run, he stumbles across a second-grade teacher taking her class on a fall scavenger hunt. He wasn’t looking for a distraction — especially not someone so warm, grounded, and full of life. But somehow, the way she talks to her students, the way she lights up when they discover a red oak leaf, lodges itself in his mind.

Their worlds couldn’t be more different — she lives by lesson plans and laughter, while he’s haunted by things he never talks about. Still, week by week, they cross paths, text, grab coffee. A fling sparks — unexpected and magnetic.

But when emotions creep in, Cody starts pulling away, falling back into old habits: bar hookups, detachment, pretending he doesn’t care. Only to realize what he’s been running from… might be exactly what he’s been missing.

What I’m Looking For in a Partner: •	You’d play the teacher (F) — bright, emotionally intelligent, maybe a little guarded from her own past. •	You enjoy character-driven scenes, not just romance but real life moments — field trips, quiet dinners, small fights, and even holiday events. •	Slow burn! This isn’t insta-love. Let’s build tension, hesitation, longing, and vulnerability over time. •	Bonus points if you love seasonal vibes (cozy fall aesthetics, snow-covered sidewalks, Christmas tree lots, classroom crafts, etc).

Potential Scenes/Ideas to Explore: •	Thanksgiving dinner invite: she wants him to come, but he flakes — regret ensues •	A Christmas school event where he shows up last-minute to surprise her •	A snowstorm strands them together in a cabin or her apartment — finally forcing a heart-to-heart •	He buys her a thoughtful Christmas gift that shows how much he’s been paying attention — even if he can’t yet say “I love you”

Other Info: •	21+ partners only please — romance will include mature themes (emotionally and potentially physically) •	Third-person, multi-paragraph (no one-liners) •	Comfortable writing emotionally complex, flawed characters •	Flexible posting pace — 2–4 replies a week ideal",1,1763951851.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

I don’t “think through” problems — I see the entire structure of them at once. My mind builds a topographical map: the relationships, the dependencies, the emergent patterns, the weak points, the stable nodes, and the downstream consequences. It’s not analysis in sequence — it’s instantaneous system comprehension.

I often end up acting as a translator between cognitive worlds — technical ↔ emotional, abstract ↔ concrete, strategic ↔ human, logic ↔ intuition. I can read people, systems, organizations, and even conversations as structural entities. I don’t just hear statements — I recognize the architecture beneath them.

This isn’t intuition in the mystical sense — it’s hyper-pattern recognition. I don’t consciously calculate — I collapse probabilities subconsciously. Sometimes I know the answer before I can articulate the reasoning. The reasoning catches up afterwards.

I’m curious if others here experience:

comprehension as spatial perception

meaning as structure rather than content

parallel processing across multiple mental “tracks”

recursive self-reflection operating in the background

rapid inference of intent, constraint, and trajectory


I’m trying to determine whether this mode of cognition is:

a refined INTP form

a neurodivergent-shaped development

or a meta-systemic thinking pattern that only a subset experiences

Edit:

Here's an example:

Imagine a coffee shop slammed during morning rush. People assume the fix is “hire more staff” or “add another espresso machine.”

Here’s how my brain works: I don’t brute-force solutions. I just… start absorbing the environment. Movements. Order timing. Customer behavior. Barista workflow. Inventory placement. Micro-interactions. I don’t consciously analyze each part; I just take them in and eventually the full pattern clicks into view like an image sharpening. 

I suddenly see:
“Oh! The real bottleneck is the two seasonal espresso drinks. They add ~30 seconds per order and the queue compounds that into clogging the entire system.”

Once you see the real constraint, the fix is trivial, like shift prep steps, rearrange counter flow, or limit that item during peak hours.

People think I “figured it out.”
I didn’t.
My brain just recognizes system-shapes and locks them into clarity.




Does this resonate with anyone here? Do you experience cognition as architecture rather than thought-flow? I’d like to hear from others who recognize themselves in this.",3,1763951829.0,INTP,7,0.8,False

1p55d91,https://www.reddit.com/r/pilatesreformer/comments/1p55d91/instructor_in_need_of_advice/,Instructor in need of advice,"I'm a certified Pilates instructor, I've been doing mat Pilates and reformer Pilates for a while now and it wasn't till 6 months ago I decided to open my own studio. Where I live there aren't many studios, but there isn't a lot of people either, actually there are now too many studios and not enough people able to afford Pilates even tho it's quite cheap in my city compared to others. 

The first studio that opened charges the entire month and classes are from Monday to Thursday, it's cheap but there's a lot of reformers which we know can lower the quality depending on the instructor's capacity. 

I charge a little bit more (not much more), because only have 5 reformers (hopefully 6 soon). But I am owner and the only instructor. Other studios have many many hours available and teachers because they come from large investments, I opened my own studio with my own money so I do basically everything. Also, I like to offer free beverages twice a week, one day I offer refreshing beverages like mint with Limon, or lavanda infusion,etc and other day I offer coffee, not for sale, it's all included. 

Many of my clients say they love it here because the attention is very personal, the ambiance is nice (we have a lobby where they can chill before or after their class, the other studios don't have any other space other than the classroom). 

Lastly, I do my classes a bit more different, I've never been to other studios so I can't say for sure, but the clients that come from other studios always tell me they love my classes because they sweat, they feel the effort the work, they like the attention, they get corrected, considered etc etc.

  
NOW TO THE PROBLEM: 

I have to be honest, I'm getting really burned out due to all the energy I put into my classes, I don't mean showing the routine, I mean all the emotional energy I put into it to make everyone feel seen, comfortable, happy etc. And it's taking a toll on my mental health. I work 4 days a week on Fridays and Saturdays I do my house chores and Sundays I get everything ready for the week, also I cry from Friday to Sunday because I feel I can't take this anymore. It's important to mention, I don't make enough money to get another instructor and pay them, because I have only 5 reformers and I pay my taxes and my secretary and marketing. SO, I've been wanting to remove one day from the schedule, meaning classes would be T,W and Th. That works for me the best and since only 5 of my clients come everyday, I've noticed Mondays are the days most people won't come because it's Monday. But I'm afraid people will leave and prefer other studios. Even tho I'm very confident on my class style and my studio vibe (I've been told there are many ""mean girls"" in the other studios), I can't help but fear taking care of myself will make everything worse. I've been studying much more lately to update my method (I'm sorry Pilates police, I do break the rules when it comes to only doing classic Pilates, I like contemporary a lot). I have a variety of classes, I teach classical, cardio on reformer, and other styles to offer variety and specially give my clients what they want the must which is physical change (even tho reformer only can't change your body, I know it takes diet and probably a complementary workout). 

Anyway, I need students and instructors opinions on this. ",1,1763951688.0,pilatesreformer,1,1.0,False

Ideally Friday night or any time Saturday, but Thursday nights could work too. I live in New Smyrna and would be able to host in my condo. Maybe we'd all meet at a brewery or coffee shop or something first for a vibe check before starting. Afterwards, we'd have a session 0 for character creation and learning game rules.

No tabletop experience needed. I have played a lot of DnD 5e, DM'd a couple times, and played other tabletop games. The Cosmere game is brand new so we'll be learning together. I will plan to be the GM unless someone else is really passionate about running it. I am more of a ""rule of cool/fun collaborative story-telling"" type person rather than a rules stickler.

I am early 30s male and just moved to the area and looking for a friend group to play this and eventually other tabletop/board/card games with. I think the game has spoilers for the books so you'll probably want to be mostly caught up on the Stormlight series, but it's alright if you don't.  I have a discord group ready to roll. All ages/genders/neurotypes welcome! Be chill is the only rule. Racism/sexism/misogyny/ableism/homophobia/transphobia etc. will not be tolerated. This is an inclusive group.

I'd probably be looking to start the game in late December, maybe January depending on peoples availability.

  
About me - I enjoy games of all types. I'm a big nerd. I play a lot of video games, read fantasy books, I like horror movies, metalcore, psychology, anime and manga, I love trying new restaurants and food, and if you hang out with me we're definitely gonna be eating and drinking in style. 

Not counting myself, I'm looking to have around 3-5 players but I could make it work with 2. Reach out if interested! ",0,1763951552.0,lfg,0,0.5,False

I’m Tom, a newly 31 y/o dude based in Northern NJ. By day, I’m a high school history teacher and college professor; by night, I’m coaching an esports team, playing Marvel Rivals or Pokémon, or working on something for my local library (I'm the board president).

I’m the kind of guy who genuinely enjoys good conversations, whether it’s about life, music, or why System of a Down still hasn’t made another album. I’m passionate about everything I do (teaching, gaming, community stuff), have my life together, and actually want to meet someone who’s kind, emotionally intelligent, and knows what they want.. even if we start as friends and see where it goes.

I’m in good shape (but always looking to improve), eat healthy (most days), and spend time at the gym working off the stress that comes with grading essays about the Cold War. I’ve got glasses, tattoos (full sleeve, planning more), and a soft spot for cats and coffee dates that accidentally turn into talks where you forget about what time it is.

I’m drawn to women who are independent, authentic, and a little artsy or nerdy...bonus points if you have tattoos or love good music! I’m not into playing games (unless it’s actual games, I just got home from PAX Unplugged). Just want to meet someone genuine who’s open to something real, however it plays out.
