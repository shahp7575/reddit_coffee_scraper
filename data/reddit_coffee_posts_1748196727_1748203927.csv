I hope you‚Äôve been doing okay. I‚Äôve held off on reaching out because I wanted to give you the time and space you asked for, and also because I knew I needed to grow into the kind of man who deserves to speak to you again.

I hope you‚Äôve been taking care of yourself‚Äîplaying MLBB, watching your favorite K-dramas and YouTube videos, and enjoying all your comfort snacks. I smile thinking about the little things that made you happy, and I genuinely hope you‚Äôve had time to enjoy them and feel peace.

There hasn‚Äôt been a day that‚Äôs gone by where I haven‚Äôt thought about you. I miss your laugh, your voice, our late-night talks, and the way we always kept each other entertained. I think about my goofy dances, the cringey anime lines that made you roll your eyes and laugh, or when I‚Äôd let you kick me in the ass just to see you smile. I‚Äôm sorry I lost that side of me for a while. I want to be that person again. I want to make you laugh again.

I still think about our time together, like our Stardew Valley farm. You‚Äôd tend to the crops, decorate our home, make me coffee while I fought monsters or fished. We‚Äôd compete over who brought in more gold, even though your empire always outshined my ponds. I remember saving up so much just to get you the teleportation scepter, only for you to still show up late to bed like me. We laughed about it then, and I still smile thinking about it now. Or that first night we met, playing Monopoly and laughing so hard we couldn‚Äôt finish the game. I remember giving you piggyback rides up and down the stairs, how terrible I was at bowling, and how much we laughed. I planned every visit like it was a holiday just to make sure you felt cared for. Spoiling you was never a burden. It was love.

Even before we were official, I loved walking you to class, sitting in the dining hall, just being near you. Back then, I didn‚Äôt need a label. I just needed you. That connection was something rare, and I didn‚Äôt realize how rare until I lost it.

Over the past few months, I‚Äôve done a lot of deep reflection. I tried to step into your shoes and imagine what you were going through‚Äîhow much pressure you were under, how tired you must‚Äôve been, how strong you had to be just to keep everything together. You were trying to lean on me, and I wasn‚Äôt steady enough to hold you. I‚Äôm truly sorry for that.

I took your words to heart. I got my job, my license, and my car. I stopped day trading because I realized how much stress it caused and how much it was pulling me away from what really matters. I didn‚Äôt realize how much emotional weight I was carrying, or how much I was letting bleed into us. I quit right after we broke up, and since then, I‚Äôve been rebuilding myself in a way that feels more stable and real.

When we broke up, it felt like something in me snapped‚Äîbut not in a chaotic way. It was like all the noise, all the pressure suddenly went quiet. That moment broke me, but it also woke me up. I saw how far I‚Äôd drifted from the man I wanted to be.

I stopped skipping interviews. I showed up. I threw my drugs into the Fremont River. I couldn‚Äôt keep living like that. I didn‚Äôt want that version of me to be the one I carried into my future or the one you remembered. I‚Äôve stayed clean, and that‚Äôs helped me become more grounded and clear-headed. Life after college hit me harder than I expected. I broke down. I stopped doing the small things that made our life feel so beautiful. I stopped trying. I lost my purpose, and in doing so, I lost sight of how much pressure that put on you too.

Since then, I‚Äôve focused on rebuilding myself. I got close to my dad, and I talk to him about everything‚Äîespecially about you. I told him how deeply I love you. He‚Äôs helped guide me, and I‚Äôve listened. I want to be someone who is resilient, self-aware, and knows how to love the right way.

Patience is something I‚Äôve learned the hard way. And yes, I‚Äôve been hard-headed. But I always listened to you‚Äîmore than you may have realized. I remember your voice, your strength, your intelligence, your heart. Those are the things that made me fall in love with you. I just wish I had said it more.

One of my biggest mistakes was always having my head stuck in the future. Chasing this idea of success, imagining what we‚Äôd become. But I forgot the most important part: being with you in the present. I never forgot my promise to get you your little house next to our mansion. I engraved that in my heart. I didn‚Äôt say it lightly. That promise still lives in me.

I‚Äôm sorry I stopped asking the little questions‚Äîthe ones that showed I cared. I let my pain mute my curiosity. I stopped being your safe place, and that‚Äôs something I carry with a lot of regret.

Even with distance, I can‚Äôt get you out of my mind. I still think about that night in January when we kissed. It wasn‚Äôt just physical. It felt like love, trust, comfort‚Äîeverything we were. That moment reminded me of the depth of our connection when we were present with each other. I hold that memory not out of longing, but respect. I hope one day I can grow into the person who can give that kind of love again.

What hurts most isn‚Äôt the distance. It‚Äôs the silence where our connection used to live. The random, beautiful conversations. The friendship. The laughter. That‚Äôs what I miss most.

I‚Äôm not writing this to ask for anything or to change your mind. I just wanted to speak from the heart. I‚Äôve grown. I‚Äôm still growing. Whether or not we ever speak again, I want you to know how much you meant‚Äîand still mean‚Äîto me.

Thank you for loving me when I didn‚Äôt know how to love myself. Thank you, even in letting me go, for helping me find my way forward.

Wherever life takes you, I hope it‚Äôs full of peace, laughter, and everything you‚Äôve worked so hard for. And maybe, if the time ever feels right, we‚Äôll find our way back to a conversation.

Until then, take care of yourself, \_\_\_\_",1,1748203722.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1kvbqce,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjew/comments/1kvbqce/jewish_woman_confused_by_dating_jewish_male_over/,Jewish woman confused by dating Jewish male over the last few weeks,"I‚Äôm a secular Jewish girl living in the UK. I went to a  secular Jewish school, my family and most friends are Jewish however I went to university and had non Jewish friends/ boyfriends and my job is in the non Jewish community. 


I grew up traditional but not very observant. We did Friday night dinners, high holidays and kept a casual level of kosher in the home. I went to a Jewish nursery, primary and high school. I went to Israel and on Aish trips. My brothers had Barmiztvahs and I had a Batmitzvah. My parents were married by an Orthodox rabbi at a synagogue. I identity as a Jewish woman in a cultural sense however I have always struggled fitting in with the secular community and I have never been part of the orthodox community who I lived close by to. Some of my friends were friendly with some of the boys who went to the local boys school which was for stricter families and the boys had a bad reputation for being wild, parties, and lots of drugs and alcohol. 

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôm 27. I had a non Jewish boyfriend for some years and the relationship ended for various reasons and I thought I will try to find someone Jewish. I went on some dates with guys who were secular, one was more observant. I came across someone I knew years ago who was from the Jewish boys school for religious families. I actually went to the park with him about 10 years ago to smoke weed. 

We reconnect on the app. He seems keen and asks me to call him so I do. It felt nice to talk as it had been so long and I felt a sense of familiarity but also something new. I knew we were from different worlds and I found it interesting to see what he‚Äôs been doing. He‚Äôs a year younger than me and not married, lives with parents and from a large Lubavitch family. 

We continue to talk daily and he seems very interested. He calls all the time and texts me. I give him the same energy as he‚Äôs funny and charming but very full on. I told him I was with a non Jewish guy and looking for someone Jewish. He tells me he left school at 12, was addicted to drugs and drink for years until he turned 20. I was not that shocked as I know this is an issue in the religious community. Our childhoods were so different. I went to university and got 2 degrees, he was in and out of Yeshiva and working for the family business. He told me he‚Äôs calmed down and is more serious about life. 

We get on really well and we meet up. It‚Äôs summer so he comes to my home. We sit in the garden and drink tea and chat. We get on and I feel comfortable and he‚Äôs funny. 

I have been off work so haven‚Äôt left the house. He comes back again and we chat and we kiss. We continue to talk and be in regular communication. I felt a massive spark and thought he was the one I‚Äôve been waiting for. We‚Äôve both had pasts of instability and relationships but I felt we were bought together for a reason. However, I felt that this second meeting he wanted to sleep with me and was being very full on. At one point he got on top of me to kiss me. I never made a move on him. He ended up in my bed kissing me. I said you just want sex and he said I don‚Äôt, what gives you that impression? I said because you‚Äôre in my bed. He said no I don‚Äôt want sex if I wanted sex I would have touched you down below. He said I just wanted to kiss you so I knew you weren‚Äôt friend zoning me. 

I speak to my friend who says no massive red flag end it with him. I text him saying I want to end it as we‚Äôre not compatible but it‚Äôs been fun. He calls me and says we are compatible. I voiced I think he‚Äôs too religious for me and we‚Äôre from different worlds. I was looking at pictures of a local photographer and I saw a family photo from his brothers wedding. It scared me as all the brides look the same in the long sleeve dresses and the hats. It scared me. I said I don‚Äôt want to wear a long sleeve dress at my wedding. He said you don‚Äôt have to we can get married on a beach. He said ‚Äúwe can compromise, it‚Äôs all about compromise‚Äù. I said fine and we carried on talking. 

I see him again at my home due to not leaving as I‚Äôm off work due to sickness. He comes round and tells me he‚Äôs having therapy as his parents are worried he‚Äôs not married yet but he looks into my eyes and says ‚Äúbut not for long‚Äù. I asked him if his parents knew he was with me because he said he told his dad everything. He said no ‚Äúdo you want me to?‚Äù I said no. I said something about his parents not accepting me and he said ‚Äúmy parents have said as long as the girl is fully Jewish and not  divorced, my parents are fine. Nothing phases them as we‚Äôve been through a lot as a family‚Äù. I thought this was positive and maybe they‚Äôd be happy that he‚Äôs with a Jewish girl even though she is not observant but she‚Äôs fully Jewish and not divorced. He told me his ex was not Jewish and he wanted to be with her but he couldn‚Äôt as an Orthodox rabbi would not marry them. 

We continued to talk. He would call me Mrs (his second name). And continued to call me often, tell me about his days, we‚Äôd chat and make plans for the future, he said he wanted to meet my mum. He met my best friend and she said he‚Äôs crazy but she liked him. They also knew each other from years ago. 

We become intimate a few times. He continues to call me Mrs (his second name). He stays at my home and we meet up after Shabbat and ho for coffee. I ask him if he wants to come to my friends wedding and he agrees to come.

Another Shabbat passes and we speak on the phone when it‚Äôs done. I told him I really like him and feel a good connection, but I said I don‚Äôt know if I can trust him and I feel vulnerable. He said I can trust him and that he‚Äôs being honest and genuine with me and won‚Äôt hurt me. We speak for 2 hours then the next day he comes to my home and we‚Äôre intimate. He said I‚Äôd make a great wife. He‚Äôs very attentive and funny and we non stop talk and laugh and have lots to talk about. For the next few days I don‚Äôt hear from him and I worry. He‚Äôs working and busy and I‚Äôm off work so I‚Äôm over thinking. I ask him to come round to see me before Shabbat comes in and he comes.

He comes in through the door and I felt something was off but he hugs and kisses me. We go upstairs as I say I need to dry my hair. We hug and he looks at me and says ‚ÄúI have bad news for us‚Äù. I look at him and he says ‚Äúyou know how I‚Äôm a Cohen, well there‚Äôs certain restrictions in place and I just found out something, because you‚Äôre ex was not Jewish, we cannot get married when we want to. I could over look the fact that you didn‚Äôt keep kosher and that you weren‚Äôt very observant but then there‚Äôs this and a rabbi won‚Äôt marry us‚Äù. My heart sank and I felt sick. I couldn‚Äôt look at him. My eyes dazed towards the window and my ears were ringing. I said ‚Äúa rabbi won‚Äôt know about my past‚Äù, he said ‚Äúbut I do‚Äù. I said surely you knew this 4 weeks ago, he said ‚Äúwell I knew it was a thing but not like this and it‚Äôs happened to other people in the community that when a girl sleeps with a non Jew she cannot marry the Cohen man‚Äù. I was shell shocked and hurt. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing the responsible thing now rather than in 6 months when we want to get married‚Äù I had no energy to fight him or show emotion. I agreed and he sensed some sarcasm in my tone. He said ‚ÄúI feel so bad I feel so bad‚Äù I said it‚Äôs fine and kept nodding, taking it in. 

I end the relationship and he accepts it. He asks to hug me and I refuse. He says it feels awkward and starts to leave. He said ‚Äúit‚Äôs been fun, we would have made such nice babies‚Äù. I‚Äôm so silent and follow him down the stairs and he goes out the door. 

Im so confused and can‚Äôt even remember how the conversation properly went. I felt and still am so confused. He‚Äôs not reached out to me. 

I e mailed a rabbi from my old school for some advice or clarity on what the hell has just happened. 

I found this sub and it makes me think that he‚Äôs a very confused person who has maybe had some brain washing and is struggling on his path? He‚Äôs flitting between sleeping with me and being with me, to then wanting to uphold his Cohen name. I just find it crazy. Surely if he wanted to marry me, he could. 

Other reasons I think he said this to me was that he just wanted sex and already knew this information but waited to tell me when he got what he wanted. 

Or he generally liked me but wants to chose his Cohen status over me. But he told me his brothers wife is not even Jewish and the family aren‚Äôt sure if she is as he met her abroad. 

I feel like if you want to be with someone, you would do anything to be with them and there would be a way around this Cohen thing. Is this some sort of family brain washing that‚Äôs made him end the relationship? Or is he a sexist pig who‚Äôs used me for sex and lied to me for weeks, and used my past against me when it suits him?  ",1,1748203590.0,exjew,0,1.0,False

She asked whether we could offer a room and, as a second question, whether WiFi was included in the room price. I confirmed both. The price seemed okay to them, as did the deposit, so I made the reservation.

While I was doing this, she asked about the wifi two more times and I already suspected how the whole thing would turn out. I deliberately didn't tell her the password for the WiFi until after she had paid. 

She took the elevator up and - surprise, surprise - less than 2 minutes later the elevator came down again. I was very excited about the story. Apparently the room smelled extremely of perfume and she couldn't spend the night there (spoiler: I went upstairs and checked it, it wasn't true).

No problem - there were 10 other rooms available and I offered her a move.
But no, it was all too stressful for her with us and she wanted her money back and left. I didn't have to do it, but she really hadn't touched anything in the room, so I refunded her the money.

She then sat down in the lobby without comment, took out a bottle of water and her cell phone and seemed to want to make herself comfortable.
Our hotel was right next to the main train station, so she probably had to wait a long time for the next train and, as a woman, didn't want to sit alone somewhere in the train station (although Burger King, for example, was definitely still open, maybe Madame didn't like the atmosphere there?). So she apparently came up with the great idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing a fake request to get the password for the Internet and waiting in our lobby.

If she had just come in and described the situation truthfully, maybe even ordered a cup of coffee - I would have been happy to let her wait with us. And yes, I would have given her the wifi password too.
But stealing my time with shit like that and then sitting in the lobby as a matter of course?

1kvbldt,https://i.redd.it/vmw6jap9hz2f1.jpeg,"Dr. Ram√≠rez: "".. promising pathways for urban regeneration""","**Dr. Ram√≠rez**:  It's clear that the mycostructural approach depicted in these visualizations represents far more than a novel construction technique  - it potentially constitutes a fundamental reimagining of urban morphology, material production, and social organization within built environments. While significant challenges remain regarding implementation, regulation, and equitable access, the convergence of technical innovation with anthropological, psychological, and ecological insights suggests promising pathways for urban regeneration in an era of increasing social and environmental complexity.

I'm struck by how this approach potentially transcends the false binary between technological and social solutions to urban challenges. By simultaneously addressing material production, spatial configuration, and social organization, it reminds us that truly sustainable urbanism requires integrated rather than segregated thinking. The mycelial metaphor embedded in these structures \_of connection, adaptation, and symbiosis - perhaps offers an appropriate framework for reimagining not just our buildings but our entire approach to inhabiting shared environments.

  
Thank you all for this deeply insightful discussion.

1kvbjm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kvbjm5/finally_asked_a_girl_out_but_turns_out_shes_gay/,Finally asked a girl out but turns out she's gay,"I met this girl about one and a half months ago. I approached her first after a few eye contacts, and had a very long and engaging conversation. As she seemed very spontaneous and interested, I asked her number very naturally and she gave it without any hesitancy.

After that we had been texting back and forth. Even tho I found she had very long reply gap, every time she replied it's very lengthy and effortful messages. I was kinda confused but thought maybe just keep it going and see where it goes.

Since I was a bit impatient of the slow texting, I just asked her if she wanna grab a coffee sometime. If she says no I would just move on. But unexpectedly she agreed very quick and planned a time on weekend. I was very excited as this could be a very positive signal. However, on Saturday she said she got sick and wanna reschedule to next weekend, and confirmed again with me whether it works for me. I didn't think too much since it was she that proposed rescheduling.

But next Friday when I texted her to confirm the plan I got left on read. I got pissed off and thought if she wants to reject me there are so many other ways, but why propose a reshedule and flake on me? This was not even out of intimacy but instead basic respect. So next week I just sent one last msg said I understand things got shifted or busy and wish her all the best. Then I was abt to move on and stopped putting any weight on it.

When I thought it was over she texted me and said she's very forgetful and terrible at texting, and asked me if I'm still up for meet up. At that time I almost lost interest but still curious what's exactly going on so I agreed, but without too much expection it would happen. This time it worked and we met at a coffee shop and had a park walk. In person she's very nice and I could feel she tried to carry the convo proactively.

But after the first ""date"" I still felt something was missing, and I still didn't find out the reason behind the inconsistency of in person interaction and the strange texting pattern. Then I went to traveling and didn't text her bc of the slow replies. But after a few days she texted me first and asked how's my trip. I thought maybe it's time to show a bit more commitment and see if she wants to take things more serious. So I said ""it would be better if you were here"".

And just as the title says, she said if she didn't interpret the vibe wrong she wanted to let me know she's gay. I was like....bro what???? She also said she's still down to hang out every now and then as friends. It just feels weird to me as it's like 5 mins ago I had romantic intention to someone but now I gotta take them as bro? It sounds very rediculous but it seems to be the missing piece I was trying to find out previously. She actually takes the ""date"" as meet-up with a bro so flaking and no replies probably don't matter that much to her.

There could be other explanations but it's time for me to move on to other really interested girls. One good lesson from this wild experience is, when you notice a yellow signal, there is usually something wrong, and the reasons behind it are usually not that important. I would say in early stages there's nothing wrong of ""keep trying"" since it sometimes works. But keep in mind that before you try with yellow signal, be prepared for any results you might get lol.",2,1748203114.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1

My husband, Eric, was on a business trip abroad when he got caught in a terrorist attack.

Everyone started calling me.

The embassy reached out, asking me to come in for discussions.

Even Eric‚Äôs family and colleagues bombarded me with calls, inquiring about the situation‚Äîsome even offered to help bring him back, free of charge.

I had just come out of the delivery room, yet I calmly hung up on call after call.

After all, when Eric saw the news of his ex-girlfriend, Aria, a war correspondent, caught in the crossfire of a terror attack, he left me‚Äîhis pregnant wife‚Äîto fly over and make sure she was safe.

Back then, I was leaking amniotic fluid, clutching my swollen belly, and I asked him:

‚ÄúAre you really going to abandon your wife and unborn daughter to go into a war zone? Eric, if you go, I will not be responsible for the consequences.‚Äù

Eric had taken all our bank books and passports and shouted at me, ‚ÄúYou and the baby aren‚Äôt going to die anytime soon‚Äîshe, on the other hand, could be dead the next second!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just giving birth. Haven‚Äôt you always been strong?‚Äù With that, he slammed the door and left.

So, if he‚Äôs the one throwing his life away, why should I save him?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Eric loved watching international news. I never understood why‚Äîuntil two days ago when a news report aired.

A female war correspondent had been captured by terrorists during an interview.

The footage lasted only a second, but I recognized her immediately‚ÄîAria, the most famous anchor on the international channel.

At that moment, I was nine months pregnant, about to go into labor. Sitting in a rocking chair in the living room, I rested my hand on my belly and felt a pang of sympathy for the journalist.

The next second, Eric knocked over the fruit bowl in a panic.

He stood up so quickly that his knee slammed into the corner of the coffee table.

The impact looked so painful that even I winced, but Eric didn‚Äôt seem to feel a thing.

He staggered into the kitchen for a glass of water but accidentally hit the hot water button, scalding himself so badly he dropped the glass, shattering it.

Ignoring his reddened, burned skin, he rushed into the bedroom and slammed the door shut behind him.

An hour later, Eric finally emerged.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I have to go on a business trip.‚Äù

I slowly stood up, hand still resting on my belly.

‚ÄúEric, my due date is in the next couple of days. I could go into labor at any time. It‚Äôs not a good time for a trip. What if the contractions start suddenly?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know my mother died in childbirth with my younger brother. I‚Äôm genuinely terrified of giving birth.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say the thing you were most looking forward to was being the first person our daughter saw when she opened her eyes?‚Äù

Eric‚Äôs face paled, but after a moment, he said, ‚ÄúThis trip is really important to me‚ÄîI have to go. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll definitely be back before you give birth.‚Äù

I gave him a broken smile.

Even though the pain in my belly was already sharp and spasmodic, and fluid was trickling down my legs like a faucet had been turned on.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll agree. But Eric, I want you to know‚Äîwhatever consequences come from this trip, you‚Äôll face them alone. I won‚Äôt bear any of it for you.‚Äù

Maybe my expression was too solemn, because Eric‚Äôs body trembled slightly.

Then, as if swearing an oath, he said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll come back safely.‚Äù

With that, he rushed into the room, hastily packed a few items of clothing, and shoved on his shoes, ready to leave.

Just as he was about to walk out the door, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. I softened and called out to him.

‚ÄúEric, wait a second.‚Äù

He turned back, visibly irritated.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you already say I could go? Why are you calling me back now?‚Äù

Clutching my hand tightly into a fist, the pain in my belly intensifying, I remained calm.

‚ÄúYou forgot your passport.‚Äù

I dragged my body, still leaking amniotic fluid, back into the bedroom.

I brought him his passport, and then handed him a bank card.

That card held every paycheck Eric had transferred to me over the seven years of our marriage.

His hand trembled slightly as he took the passport and the card, and even his eyes began to redden.

Chapter 2

For a moment, I thought he might stay.

But instead, he stuffed the card and passport into his bag and swore again:

‚ÄúI promise I‚Äôll be back before the baby comes.‚Äù

Then he slammed the door and left in a rush.

I listened to the echo of the door slamming shut in our now-empty home and calmly called the maternity ward and a postnatal care center.

A man who didn‚Äôt even notice my water had broken dared to swear he‚Äôd return in time for the birth.

How laughable.

Eric and I met through a mountaineering club.

Back then, I worked at a tech company under intense pressure. I regularly worked overtime, and the only time I could breathe was on weekends when I hiked to recover some energy.

He joined the club in my second year there. At first, we were just regular teammates, but we always charged ahead together, always the first to reach the summit. Over time, we grew close.

He worked in investment banking.

I worked in internet tech.

He liked hiking, running, and working out.

So did I.

When we summited our hundredth mountain, he confessed his love to me.

No fancy words, no over-the-top romance.

Just one sentence: ‚ÄúFreya, let‚Äôs be together.‚Äù

I agreed.

Not because he was especially charming‚Äîmy father was the king of romance. When he pursued my mother, he lit up half the city with fireworks and even got arrested for disturbing the peace.

But that passion ultimately destroyed my mother. When she was pregnant with their second child, my father‚Äôs mistress showed up, deliberately provoking my mother who was about to go into labor‚Äîand it killed her on the operating table.

So I‚Äôd long since realized: romance is cheap. Reliability is what matters.

And Eric was reliable.

He was never late.

His gifts were always clich√©, but he never forgot a single occasion.

He wouldn‚Äôt pick me up when it rained, but the moment I called, he‚Äôd come without hesitation.

So, after three years of dating, we got married.

Married life wasn‚Äôt much different from before.

We split chores equally. On holidays, we took turns choosing vacation spots‚Äîone trip to a place he liked, one to a place I liked.

It was calm, orderly, and uneventful.

I once believed I was made for this kind of life.

Until three years ago, when one of his college friends got married, and he brought me along to the wedding.

At the bachelor party, one of his very drunk friends pulled him aside and cried:

‚ÄúEric, seeing you like this‚Äîwith no spark in your eyes‚Äîbreaks my heart.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting married tomorrow. I‚Äôm finally stepping into happiness. But you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre like someone who‚Äôs locked his heart away.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf Aria hadn‚Äôt insisted on becoming a war reporter, you wouldn‚Äôt have ended up like this.‚Äù

I saw Eric glance at me, instinctively.

He quickly explained, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs drunk. Don‚Äôt listen to him.‚Äù

I just smiled and said nothing.

On the way home, leaning in the passenger seat, I said calmly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ask for much in a partner. But the one thing I need is for him to be over his ex.‚Äù

He stood where the hallway light couldn‚Äôt reach, so I couldn‚Äôt see his expression.

But from that night on, the name Aria vanished from our lives.

Until now.

Chapter 3

Because I hadn‚Äôt been answering calls.

I had just finished nursing our daughter at the postnatal center and was about to put her to sleep when the door suddenly flew open.

It was my mother-in-law, Victoria.

She rushed in, her voice trembling:

‚ÄúFreya, why haven‚Äôt you been answering your phone? William‚Äôs at the embassy, practically losing his mind!‚Äù

‚ÄúCome home with me right now. Bring Eric‚Äôs passport and documents‚Äîwe have to get to the embassy immediately and confirm what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù

William was my father-in-law.

I didn‚Äôt respond right away. I calmly said six digits: ‚Äú2-1-0-6-3-0.‚Äù

She froze.

I carefully tucked the blanket around my daughter before slowly explaining, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the code to the front door. If you need his documents, you can get them yourself.‚Äù

Victoria‚Äôs hands trembled.

‚ÄúFreya, how can you be so cold? Eric is in a war zone‚Äîhis life‚Äôs in danger.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe sent a group message asking for help. He‚Äôs been shot in the leg and is hiding in a stranger‚Äôs home, trying to dodge gunfire!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you just had surgery and need time to recover, but this is an emergency. Can‚Äôt you just come with me to the embassy, just once?‚Äù

She was shaking all over, looking like she might break down at any second.

I still spoke calmly. ‚ÄúI knew he was injured. Before he sent out that mass message, he had already sent me several desperate pleas for help. I didn‚Äôt reply.‚Äù

Victoria staggered, nearly losing her balance.

I looked at her, and I won‚Äôt deny I wavered a little inside.

After all, for the past seven years, she had treated me well. During the years I was without a mother, she had filled that void.

But all of that had already been destroyed‚Äîby Eric himself.

I took a USB drive from the nightstand and handed it to her.

‚ÄúThis is a recording of the conversation between me and Eric that night. Watch it first, then we‚Äôll talk.‚Äù

Victoria took it with trembling hands. When the video ended, she collapsed to the floor. Her lips quivered for a long time before she finally managed to speak.

‚ÄúFreya‚Ä¶ you have to believe me. Nothing ever happened between Eric and Aria.‚Äù

I still couldn‚Äôt harden my heart completely. Even though the pain from my C-section was still sharp, I forced myself to get out of bed and helped her up.

Just like that day when Eric left‚ÄîI had already gone into labor, my water had broken‚Äîbut I still softened and handed him his passport and bank card.

I said gently, ‚ÄúI know nothing physical happened between him and Aria. But the fact that he was willing to leave his wife and unborn child behind to fly into a war zone for her‚Äîthat says everything about his choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was willing to let my daughter be born without her father. He was willing to let me face the surgery alone. A man like that should be held accountable for his decisions.‚Äù

As I spoke, Victoria‚Äôs face grew paler and paler. In the end, she didn‚Äôt argue further.

Maybe even she couldn‚Äôt find a reason to convince me.

She finally gave up and stood up, her body trembling. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ get some rest. I‚Äôll leave now.‚Äù

She walked out the door looking like she‚Äôd aged ten years in an instant, stumbling as she went.

Although I truly felt sorry for her, I still called out before she could leave completely.

‚ÄúVictoria, let me know sometime this week when you and William can move out of that apartment.‚Äù

They had been living in a property I had fully paid for, ever since I got married.

Victoria turned back, exhaustion written all over her face.

‚ÄúDo you really have to rush this? Can‚Äôt you wait a little?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúDid Eric wait? When he left, he didn‚Äôt even take me‚Äîwhose water had already broken‚Äîto the hospital first. He just flew out of the country.‚Äù

‚ÄúI just want all the marital property matters settled before he comes back.‚Äù

---

The snow had begun to melt along the crooked fence lines of the Lazarev estate, and the dark soil‚Äîblack and rich as coffee grounds‚Äîbreathed again. From the veranda, Nikolai Lazarev stood with his fingers laced behind his back, watching the thaw. He was not a large man, but he held himself like one who had stood before storms and refused to bow.

In the drawing room behind him, voices murmured like the shifting of old wood. His uncles‚ÄîVasily and Anatoly‚Äîhad arrived before noon with thick coats and thicker opinions, smelling of tobacco and the musk of old furs. They had not come to visit. They had come to warn.

‚ÄúPeter is tearing the soul from Russia,‚Äù Vasily had said, stirring his tea like he meant to drown something in it. ‚ÄúShaving off beards, demanding factories and ships. It‚Äôs French talk, Dutch talk. Not Russian.‚Äù

Nikolai had said little then. He listened the way a farmer listens to dry earth crack‚Äîquietly, knowing he will plant anyway.

He stepped inside now, the scent of spring just behind him, and faced the two older men seated beside the great samovar, silver and puffing like a tired general.

‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôve forgotten who I am,‚Äù Nikolai said. ‚ÄúBut it is because I remember that I support the Tsar.‚Äù
Anatoly narrowed his eyes. ‚ÄúAnd what is it you remember so well, nephew?‚Äù
Nikolai walked slowly to the hearth, lifting a log and setting it down with a quiet thud. ‚ÄúI remember my grandfather‚Äôs hands. Cracked from working the fields when the serfs were dead of fever. He plowed beside them, not above them.‚Äù

Let me be brutally honest here. I‚Äôve tried dozens of supplements in my life, each one promising more energy, better focus, stronger immunity, and whatnot. But 90% of them either had no effect or left me with annoying side effects like headaches, bloating, or fatigue. I was exhausted, mentally and physically‚Äîuntil I found MITOLYN.

I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle when I ordered MITOLYN. I just wanted to feel normal again‚Äîto have that clear headspace, to wake up energized, to focus on my work without my mind wandering every 10 minutes. What I got was more than I ever expected.

This review is for people like me‚Äîskeptical, tired of false promises, and looking for *real* change. If that‚Äôs you, read on. My transformation might help you decide.

# üö® What Made Me Try MITOLYN?

Scrolling through social media, I kept seeing the name ‚ÄúMITOLYN‚Äù pop up in wellness groups, biohacking communities, and even from some health coaches I follow. At first, I ignored it. Another hyped-up supplement, I thought. But I kept seeing real people share genuine experiences:

* ‚ÄúMITOLYN gave me more mental clarity in 3 days than coffee ever did.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve rewound my biological clock.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just energy, it‚Äôs *cellular energy*‚Äîand I feel it.‚Äù

That got my attention.

I looked into the science behind it‚Äîand found that MITOLYN is not just a blend of random herbs. It‚Äôs based on **mitochondrial optimization**, the core energy engine inside your cells. It aims to **recharge your body at the cellular level**, meaning it doesn‚Äôt just cover symptoms‚Äîit boosts your actual foundation of energy.

And that, right there, made all the difference.

# üß™ The First Week ‚Äì Unexpected Results

I started taking MITOLYN daily, just one scoop mixed in water. The taste? Surprisingly mild. Slightly citrusy. No weird chemical flavor like most powdered supplements.

Here‚Äôs what happened over the first 7 days:

**Day 1-2:**  
Felt no drastic changes, but noticed I wasn‚Äôt reaching for coffee as quickly. I stayed more alert through the morning.

**Day 3:**  
Started waking up before my alarm. No grogginess. I cleaned my entire apartment before 9 AM‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt done in months!

**Day 4-5:**  
Mental clarity kicked in hard. No brain fog. I was flowing through work. No sluggish 3 PM crash. I even skipped my usual energy drink.

**Day 6-7:**  
This is when I realized: MITOLYN wasn‚Äôt just helping my body‚Äîit was fixing my *mind*. My anxiety dipped, I felt lighter emotionally, and my motivation skyrocketed.

# üí• Key Benefits I Experienced from MITOLYN

Let me break it down clearly. These are the results I got after using MITOLYN for **30+ days** consistently:

‚úÖ **Explosive natural energy** ‚Äì Not the jittery kind. Clean, smooth energy that stays with you throughout the day.  
‚úÖ **Sharper focus and memory** ‚Äì I‚Äôm remembering things faster, finishing tasks without distractions, and communicating more clearly.  
‚úÖ **Improved mood** ‚Äì I‚Äôve had fewer mood swings, and I actually feel happier and more patient in stressful situations.  
‚úÖ **Deeper sleep** ‚Äì I fall asleep faster and wake up feeling rested. My sleep tracker shows more REM sleep too.  
‚úÖ **Better workouts** ‚Äì I lift heavier and recover quicker. My stamina during cardio has doubled.  
‚úÖ **Zero side effects** ‚Äì No headaches, no nausea, nothing. My stomach is usually sensitive, and MITOLYN didn‚Äôt bother it at all.

# üî¨ What‚Äôs Inside MITOLYN? (Ingredients I Researched)

MITOLYN‚Äôs formula is backed by actual science. Here are some of the powerful ingredients that stood out to me:

* **CoQ10** ‚Äì A key mitochondrial nutrient for cellular energy.
* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline quinone)** ‚Äì Stimulates new mitochondrial growth.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** ‚Äì Boosts brain and muscle energy.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** ‚Äì A potent antioxidant that supports mitochondrial function.
* **Magnesium + B-Vitamins** ‚Äì Essential for energy production.

Each one is clinically studied for mitochondrial health, and they work synergistically in MITOLYN. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù mix‚Äîit‚Äôs premium quality.

# ü§Ø Why MITOLYN Stands Out From Other Supplements

I‚Äôve tried enough wellness products to know when something is just hype. MITOLYN is different because:

* It **targets the root cause** of fatigue‚Äîmitochondrial decay.
* It‚Äôs **transparent**‚Äîno proprietary blends, full ingredient list shown.
* It‚Äôs **made in the USA** in FDA-registered, GMP-certified labs.
* It actually makes you feel better in DAYS, not months.

And most importantly: it‚Äôs backed by real users, not fake reviews. You‚Äôll find Reddit threads, health blogs, even doctors quietly recommending it.

# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Is MITOLYN Legit or a Scam?

This is a fair question. When you see products that sound *too good to be true*, your inner scam alarm goes off.

But MITOLYN is 100% legit. Here‚Äôs how I know:

* It‚Äôs been tested for purity and safety.
* You get a **100% money-back guarantee** if it doesn‚Äôt work for you.
* You‚Äôre buying from the **official website**, not some shady third-party seller.

It‚Äôs not sold on Amazon or Walmart‚Äîwhich is actually a good thing. It ensures you get the **authentic formula**, not a copycat.

# üì¶ How to Buy MITOLYN (Don‚Äôt Get Fooled)

‚ö†Ô∏è If you're ready to try MITOLYN, make sure you get it only from the **official website**.  
Many fake supplements use similar names or packaging. Don‚Äôt fall for that.

# üìù Final Thoughts ‚Äì Should You Buy MITOLYN?

If you‚Äôve been tired, mentally foggy, emotionally low, or just not feeling like your best self...  
If you‚Äôve tried caffeine, workouts, sleep hacks, and nothing sticks...

Then YES. **MITOLYN is worth every penny.**

It‚Äôs more than a supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs an upgrade to your body and mind. I‚Äôm now over 2 months in, and I can honestly say: **I feel like the best version of myself.** Focused. Energized. Calm. Alive.

If you're even 1% curious, give MITOLYN a shot. You have nothing to lose, and possibly your best health to gain.",1,1748202485.0,SweetpeaOnStarz,1,1.0,False

I started taking 50mg of zoloft for generalized anxiety disorder about 9 months ago. I was previously on the same dosage from Fall 2018-Summer 2020 and experienced no side effects. This time around ive been dealing with constant constipation, bloating, fatigue, restless leg syndrome, increased OCD and very vivid stress dreams. All of these side effects began within a week or two and have never subsided.

Within a week of starting last fall, i noticed that every time i went to the bathroom to poop, i was only having pebble poops. its only gotten worse. I feel like i have to rush to the bathroom to poop 5-6 times a day and can only get one or two small pebbles out each time. I've started to feel and look constantly bloated as a result.

I've tried drinking more water, drinking more black coffee, eating more chipotle/taco bell and drinking prune juice with no success. Miralax provides some relief after taking it 3 days in a row but causes a lot of discomfort in my stomach. I feel full after eating just a couple bites at every meal. The only thing that's actually helped is skipping doses. 

2 months ago i forgot to bring my zoloft for a weekend trip. After 2 days of missed doses, i was pooping normally and no longer felt bloated at all. I got home feeling great, started taking my medicine again and was back to pebble poops after 2 days. Now i find myself feeling so horrible and constipated all the time that i keep skipping doses to feel better (which works for a day but it obviously not ideal)

I‚Äôm the kind of guy who thrives in the quiet spaces-whether that‚Äôs the dim glow of my monitor late at night or the heavy, slow riffs of a doom/stoner metal track echoing in my headphones. Social crowds aren‚Äôt my scene; I‚Äôm more about meaningful moments than surface-level noise. If you‚Äôre someone who understands that silence can be comfortable, and that sometimes the loudest things are felt, not heard, we might just get along.

Night Shift Watchkeeper & Digital Explorer
By day (or rather, night), I‚Äôm a security officer keeping watch when the world slows down. It‚Äôs a job that demands focus and calm-qualities I carry into my gaming and life. When the shift quiets, I dive into RPGs and co-op adventures on my Steam Deck, escaping to worlds where strategy, teamwork, and exploration matter more than flashy PvP kills. Think Valheim, Monster Hunter, Elder Scrolls-games where survival and story intertwine.

Gaming & Metal: My Two Realms
Gaming fuels my imagination; metal fuels my soul. My playlist runs from the crushing riffs of stoner, doom, and grunge metal to synthwave and indie rock for those rare lighter moments. Lyrics that cut deep and music that tells a story-that‚Äôs what I live for. If you can appreciate a killer guitar solo as much as a perfectly executed raid, we‚Äôre already on the same wavelength.

Creating in Quiet Corners
I‚Äôm quietly creative-sketching when inspiration strikes, slowly learning guitar to complement my modest piano skills. It‚Äôs not about perfection; it‚Äôs about expression. Music and art are my ways of making sense of the world, one riff or brushstroke at a time.

my dad and I wanted to have a bonfire. I specifically said not a big deal, just wanted to have some friends over for drinks. 

Today I told her I invited my cousin, and she made a huge deal about it- complaining and squealing about ‚Äúshe hopes she doesn‚Äôt tell any other family because then they‚Äôll all show up, and she doesn‚Äôt have enough food.‚Äù 

I explained that most other family members have stated they are busy, in which case it may only be one extra person so what‚Äôs the big deal? 

Every event we have, she ruins and always has to be in control of everything. She always wants to cook, so she can be in control and force me to give her a ‚Äúhead count.‚Äù

I stated I never asked for food, (because I didn‚Äôt.) TBH her cooking is horrible, yet she makes such a big deal about it. She wants kudos and a pat on the back but she‚Äôs lazy with it and doesn‚Äôt even try. Dumps cheap spaghetti sauce on pasta and acts like that makes her the hostess with the mostest.

Shes drunk every single day, and insufferable to be around. Furthermore there‚Äôs never any food in this house. From the time I was a kid, we had no snacks, etc. because she‚Äôs an ‚Äúalmond mom.‚Äù But all of the sudden when people come over, she wants to be the main character and make it seem like she‚Äôs so nice. 

Of course, I got the sarcastic ‚ÄúThAnKs mOm!!!!!!!!‚Äù 

I pointed out that a friend of mine is vegetarian and can‚Äôt eat certain things, so if she‚Äôs going to cook like she wants to so bad, then she should accommodate her. She called my friend a ‚Äúbi***‚Äù and said she has salad she can eat. (Salad to my mom is some lettuce with balsamic dressing on it.) 

Since I was a kid, and all throughout my teen years, my mom has consistently given me serving sizes less than what a toddler would eat, and then was confused why that wasn‚Äôt enough food for me. Yet, she has everything she wants and needs. Including tons and tons of wine. 

She is truly a nasty person and I can‚Äôt wait to get out of here, which I told her. I‚Äôve been spending all week desperately trying to find people who can hang out, so I don‚Äôt have to be around her in my final days in this house. There aren‚Äôt many options. 

If anyone has any ideas, LMK. I thought of coffee shops but those can be uncomfy at times, around here. 

TL;DR- i made it easy and wanted to have a peaceful night, she forcefully makes it ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or ‚Äúfancier‚Äù in order to take control, and because she has to be the center of attention- but under the guise of ‚Äúbeing nice.‚Äù It‚Äôs really getting old. It would be completely different if she told me she wanted to make food, and asked if I was OK with it or what i‚Äôd wanted. But no, it‚Äôs all about appeasing her ego.

I'm using an arabica single origin medium roast from Brazil, roasted the 14th, I already used it in moka pot and espresso with great result.

My equipment is a simple stove top kettle with a gooseneck spout, a ceramic V60 01 (used with a standard glass server) and a Kingrinder K6. 

Recipe one  is 30gr coffee to 380 ml water + 50ml for the bloom.  Bloom lasted for 30 secs, total brew time of ~4:30. Coffee was slightly too acidic, no sweetness at all and very dull. It somehow had a pungent and unpleasant aftertaste. 

Recipe two was the same with longer bloom, but I poured in two times. I think the result was better, still not enough sweetness and the flavour felt dull, acidity was more balanced, but still no hint of the notes which I'm used to taste with those beans. Aftertaste was the same. 

Recipe three was again the same in proportion but had a different pour style, I tried to move my kettle more hoping that my past failures were uneven extraction, but I had no success. I didn't like this last brew and I'm not sure why.

I'm not a writer and the original draft looked ugly as hell.  The content is still original and hopefully provides some value to someone out there :)

I was¬†*severely*¬†burnt out on dating.

I was that guy ‚Äî compulsively swiping on apps despite getting no matches, frequenting bars looking for connection, even dipping into pickup artist ‚Äúdaygame‚Äù stuff. I truly believed that unless I constantly chased relationships, I‚Äôd end up alone.

Eventually, through journaling and honest introspection, I realized how toxic and exhausting this mindset had become. It was taking over my time, self-worth, and energy.

I came up with a plan that helped me stop the compulsive cycle and rebuild a healthier relationship with myself first ‚Äî and now I want to share it. I‚Äôm still in like stage 13 of this process, but if it resonates with you, feel free to come along.

# üß† Step 1: Understand Your Attachment Style

Most people struggling with compulsive dating are either¬†**anxiously**¬†or¬†**avoidantly**¬†attached. I'm firmly in the anxious camp.

üîó Google ""4 attachment styles - Cleveland Clinic"" for a good article on this

# ü™û Step 2: Learn Cognitive Distortions & Reframing

Most of us have distorted thought patterns that fuel compulsive behaviors.

* üîó Google ""10 common cognitive distortions therapist aid"" for the simplest list
* üîó Google ""healthline cognitive distortion reframing"" for good info on this

*On a separate comment, I‚Äôll include a massive list of 100 distortions I got from ChatGPT.*

# üìì Step 3: Journal Regularly

I use¬†**Notion**¬†and journal daily (then run my writings through Chat GPT for feedback and to spot trends) using prompts like:

* What cognitive distortions showed up today? How can I reframe them?
* *(If anxiously attached)*¬†Did I feel impatient for connection today? How could I respond differently?
* *(If avoidantly attached)*¬†Did I hide from connection today? Why?
* What was the story of my day (in detail)?
* What am I grateful for (3 things minimum)?
* What am I proud of myself for (3 things minimum)?
* What am I excited (3 things minimum - and try make at least one of them mundane)?
* Add personalized prompts (I have OCD, so I focus on reassurance-seeking and compulsions)

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Step 4: Define What You Want in a Partner

Separate these into:

* **Dealbreakers**: things that must exist or the relationship will end up toxic (for me: emotionally available, not avoidant, 21+, compassionate, employed, politically aligned, religiously aligned, etc.)
* **Preferences**: Ideal but flexible traits (for me: soft personality, no hard drugs, college-educated, shorter than me, etc.)

# ü™û Step 5: Ask Yourself:

**""Is it likely someone who meets my standards would be attracted to me today?""**

If the answer is ""probably not,"" (which it probably is tbh) don‚Äôt spiral ‚Äî just keep working through these steps to identify why not and improve.

# üß© Step 6: Audit Your Life

Ask:

* **What anxieties am I ignoring?**¬†(e.g. money strggules, OCD, etc.)
* **What insecurities weigh on me?**¬†(e.g. BMI 41, anxious in friendships)
* **What patterns are disrupting me?**¬†(e.g. phone addiction, obsessing over dating content)
* **What am I deeply longing for?**¬†(e.g. friendship, career ambition, purpose)

# ‚è∏Ô∏è Step 7: Pause Intentional Pursuit of Dating & Build a ‚ÄúDating Baseline‚Äù

Pause intentional dating (ie: going out specifically to meet someone, using dating apps) until you meet key¬†**baseline goals**¬†‚Äî not to become avoidant, but to avoid chasing relationships that aren‚Äôt right for you.

**My Ideal Baseline:**

* BMI of 22.5
* 6 months emergency savings
* 10 new local friends
* 3 promotions
* 30 mins meditation daily
* ‚â§ 2 hours screen time
* Daily journaling
* Own a new car

# ‚úÖ Step 8: Make a Realistic Version of Those Goals

We aren't aiming for perfection, we're aiming for¬†**momentum.**  Resume dating once you reach your acceptable baseline, but keeping working toward the ideal baseline.

**My Acceptable Baseline:**

* BMI of 30
* 3 new friends
* 1 promotion
* 10 mins meditation
* ‚â§ 4 hours screen time
* 4x/week journaling
* 4 months emergency savings
* Car from 2017‚Äì2022

# üîÅ Step 9: Translate Goals Into Daily Habits

* Walk 10K steps
* Lift 3x/week
* Eat 3 healthy meals
* Attend 2 social events
* Study for career designation
* Meditate 10 mins
* Journal daily
* $350/paycheck to savings, $150 to car

# üß± Step 10: Break Habits Into Smallest Meaningful Units

* Walk 4K steps
* Watch 1 video on lifting form
* Eat 1 healthy meal
* Research 1 event
* Study once
* Meditate 5 mins 3x/week
* Journal 4x/week
* Save $200/paycheck

# üìä Step 11: Build a Habit Tracker

Use Google Sheets or Notion:

* Rows = habits
* Columns = days of week
* Have a column for score (based on how many days you accomplished it), level up (when to up the habit to the next meaningful unit), & a reminder as to why this habit is important to your long-term vision.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Step 12: Tailor Journal Prompts to Your Goals

Example prompts based on my personal introspection:

* How was my relationship with food today?
* When did I feel present today? When did I feel unpresent?
* What‚Äôs one meaningful connection I had today (however small)?
* How was my relationship with my phone today?
* How was my workday? Did I move towards a promotion?
* Was I mindful with how I spent money?

# üÜô Step 13: Level Up Habits Gradually

Each week, increase the challenge slightly if you succeeded the week before (until you reach your ideal habit from step 9‚Ä¶ or even beyond if you want).

Slow, sustainable change > burning out fast.

# üå± Step 14: Reintegration (When Ready)

Once you meet your baseline goals, you can reintegrate dating ‚Äî¬†*intentionally*.

# üß† Step 15: Reintegration Strategy

* Use apps like Hinge/Bumble with intention (premium accounts + good photos)
* Ask friends/family to set you up (especially if they notice your glow-up!)
* Join aligned group events or classes
   * Google ""event matrix"" by Logan Ury for helping picking what to join. The crux is, pick events where it's highly likely you'll enjoy it, and there will be people you're interested in at.
* At public events (concerts, clubs, meetups), talk to people naturally. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúhit on‚Äù them ‚Äî just connect.

**Simple ask-out line:**

>""I've really enjoyed this conversation, we should continue it over coffee (or drinks if you're really feeling it) sometime.""

# üìå Step 16: Hold Your Standards

Don‚Äôt lower them just to avoid being alone. If you‚Äôve done the work, trust that you deserve someone aligned with your values and efforts.

Let me know if anyone‚Äôs on a similar journey or wants to walk this path together. I'm not trying to sell anything, just want to help others skip some of the trial & error it took to get me to this point.

It looks at things like:

* Shared experience in industries or roles
* Their career path and current role

It‚Äôs not perfect ‚Äî I‚Äôm still figuring a lot of it out ‚Äî but the goal is to help people walk into a call or coffee chat with more context, especially if they‚Äôre networking, selling, interviewing, or just trying to make the conversation more personal.

It looks at things like:

* Where you and the other person went to school
* Shared experience in industries or roles
* Their career path and current role
* What kind of questions you could ask or topics to bring up

Kind of like a personal briefing doc that makes you sound like you did your homework ‚Äî even if you didn‚Äôt.

If you‚Äôve ever Googled someone 5 minutes before a call and tried to sound like you knew what they did... this is for that.

Still early and raw but would love feedback or thoughts. Trying to see if this is something people would actually use.

I took Tylenol yesterday and it lasted most of the day but I got a headache again at night and sleeping didn‚Äôt even help. I took Tylenol again today. I also feel like there‚Äôs a dark pit in my chest that just won‚Äôt go away no matter what and I even sometimes have suicidal ideation (this is just PMS symptoms and goes away after I get my period- no need to worry I‚Äôm not going to do anything to myself) but even being self aware of this doesn‚Äôt make it go away. 

It also makes my adhd unmanageable because my brain goes haywire and I can‚Äôt focus to save my life and the only thing that helps is drinking coffee because my parents refuse to let me take medication. 

I know if I eat less sugar and exercise regularly it will greatly improve my symptoms and my mental health overall but I just can‚Äôt do anything about it. It‚Äôs incredibly hard for me to get up and go to the gym. Once I‚Äôm at the gym I can‚Äôt stay focused on anything and constantly space out. Once I‚Äôm at the gym and exercising I feel great but it‚Äôs a constant battle to get myself there. I also can‚Äôt go on runs unless I wake up at 5am because I live in Arizona and it‚Äôs too hot. And I can‚Äôt help myself from eating too much sugar because my brain is starved for dopamine.

I really, really want to take medication and I have a mental block where I think once I get medication I can finally start living healthier (even though I know I can do this without medication, it will just be harder).

I just don‚Äôt want to live my life through a series of coping mechanisms that stop working after a week and constant battles with myself that cause me stress, worsening my pms and preventing me from sleeping at night making my health and functioning that much worse. 

I want the easy way out by taking medication. If everyone else just gets to function for free because their brain works right why is it suddenly considered lazy when I want to take a medicine that gets me close to that. 

And the most frustrating part is that the medication is currently in my house. My dad let me get prescribed and go pick it up from the pharmacy, but when I got home took it away from me and hid it because ‚Äúit can be addicting‚Äù. I WAS RIGHT THERE AT THE FINISH LINE.

He‚Äôs not letting me take it until I get a therapist which is an endless cycle of calls and executive dysfunction and I have lost motivation because I can‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs going to move the goalpost again and put it that much further out of reach .
I‚Äôm 18. He said I can take it if I pay for it myself but I can‚Äôt use insurance which is incredibly cruel because I rely on my parents and can‚Äôt afford that. I graduated from high school 3 days ago.

I‚Äôm just so fucking tired of everything. And I have a fucking insane anti vax and anti med mother that threatened to kick me out when my dad forced me to tell her I was going to take medication before he let me take it (which he then walked back on) 

I just can‚Äôt fucking win. I wish my parents would take their fucking heads out of their asses and see what their insanity and incompetence is doing to me.

He was clearly struggling to pick everything up while juggling his wallet and keys. Eventually, he managed on his own, but the whole scene got me thinking. Why do people often just stand around in everyday situations like this, waiting for someone else to act? 

Maybe it's that ""bystander apathy"" thing I read about. Like, when there's more people around, we're less likely to help because we think someone else will do it. But...even in minor situations? 

It makes me wonder if we're so caught up in our bubble or social comforts that we forget it's okay to just step up and lend a hand. Sure, it's not a life or death moment, but still, wouldn't it make things a bit warmer if we did?

It doesn‚Äôt just move cargo‚Äîit raises it right.

Outside? Top-deck habs mounted near crane arms. Deck-mounted cargo racks.  
Inside? Order, comfort, and the faint smell of coffee that was probably brewed four hours ago and still tastes fine.

Four single-berth crew cabins. Two full bathrooms (yes, *full*‚ÄîUC compliant, 2:1 ratio, suck it Ryujin bunk pods). Internal logistics office. A mess hall big enough to swap stories, a laundry room you‚Äôd let your kids use, and a logistics office that smells faintly of laminate and quiet authority.

And the kicker? That cavernous cargo bay. Could move freight. Could host a barbecue. We‚Äôre not saying it‚Äôs kid-friendly, but if a crew started a family mid-haul, they‚Äôd have space to teach 'em how to stack crates by age three.

Oh‚Äîand for good measure, it features the MCAS-patented **Bridge Anti-Boarding System.** Which is corporate speak for ‚Äúget your pirate boots off my airlock.‚Äù

1kvanxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kvanxs/went_on_my_first_date_and_i_have_questions_can/,Went on my first date and I have questions - can you help me?,"For context: I'm a 20 year old male with little (basically no) relationship experience. Yesterday I went to my first date (ever). Short version and the questions at the bottom, but I would like to write in detail so you can notice something I might not.

I've been talking to this girl (she's 18) for 3 weeks, and during this time we went along extremelly well - we've talked about lots of stuff and flirted a lot, she sent me dozens of audios etc.

We were trying to go on a date for two weeks, but our schedule never matched (until yersterday). We decided to go to a play at the local theater. I was nervous, but I think it's normal.

I met her near this theater, and she seemed nervous too (and she was INSANALEY pretty, I could not belive it). It was a little awkward, but after some minutes I felt we got more comfortable. We were both acting exactly like in the messages - making jokes all the time, laughing at silly things etc. It seems like it was going fine - it wasn't like a \*perfect\* date, but it wasn't bad.

The play would start at 5pm, and it was 4pm, so we decided to grab a coffee. When we sat down to talk, she asked me something that got me worried, because it was a insecurity of mine: she said ""OP, what is your exact height?"" (I'm 5'7 in a country where men have the avarage height of 5'9. She was about 5'5).

I said in a somewhat playful way ""yeah I know I'm not that tall!! I'm about 5'7..."" and she answred ""but that's fine!! Just asked because I think you're about my dad's height! It's not bad..."" (ofc it wasn't because of it lol)

We took our coffee and continued talking, laughing etc. Then whe went to some stores around the area (it was a ""chinatown"" kind of area, so there were plenty of different stores and stuff), and it was all fine - it was just like we talked online, but in person. It wasn't even awkward, it was pretty fun and I felt she was enjoying it - but I wasn't feeling a ""romantic"" or ""special"" vibe.

We then went to see the play, it was good and we were making comments to one another during it, making jokes about it etc. After that, we talked about the play and I drove her to a bus station (long story, but she spents her Sundays at her grandma's house which is in another city. She had already told me about this before the date and said that she would have to leave at that agreed time, so it was no surprise). During the ride, we talked a little bit more, she asked more things about my life and that was it.

As we approached the bus station, I felt the atmosphere getting weird/awkawrd again, and as she got out of the car we said goodbye and she gave me a kiss on the cheek. After I got home, I waited for 1 hour and a half and sent her a message saying ""hey, did you get at your grandma's house safely? I enjoyed our day!!"", she replied ""yes I just got here!!! I really liked it too!"" and sent me a stand-alone heart emoji (she used to send this when I complimented her or something more ""special"").

I then sent her a message saying ""The play was pretty cool and I think you're were looking amazing!"" and sent her a meme I know she likes. Now, here comes the questions:

====================================

1. When we texted, we used to each send a bunch of messages at once, but she would reply on one day, and I on the next (due to busy schedules in our lives and the amount of messages - we usually would talk about like 12 things at the same time). After that last message yesterday, she didn't reply to me. Following the normal pattern of messages, it's ok/expected... but right after a date? Shouldn't she have sent something already? It's a bad sign, isn't it?
2. I'm sure that the height stuff was a bad unexpected thing to her - even if after the talk about it, she acted normally and seemed to have enjoyed. What are the chances that this ruined everything?
3. She didn't seem too experienced (even because she's 18) and she was quite nervous too, but is it normal to not have too much touch and actually no kissing on a date? Is it a bad sign, or am I taking things too quickly? Is it normal to not feel too ""romantic"" on the first date like this?
4. I'm gonna be honest: I'm a 6-7/10 looking guy and she is easily a 9/10... if she doesn't send me a message today, I'll take it as she is not interested anymore (and that's ok). But I won't lie: this will ruin part of my self steem. How do you deal with this?

**Short version:** I've been talking for weeks with a girl, and we made a great connection during it. We had a date yesteday. It went well, in general: we talked just like we did online, mad a lot of jokes, enjoyed ourselves and she seemed to have liked it, but she made a comment/question about my height that made me insecure. After the date, she answred ""well"" to the message I sent her, but now she's taking longer to answer it (even though it's not out of the ""average time"" she usually answers me). I have questions about it (the numbered ones above).",2,1748200803.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I'm looking for advice to help balance my work, life, and time with my son. For some background his mother and I were together for 5 years 3 of then engaged. She and I started having difficulty around her not working. I took care of all the bills (we lived together in an apartment) as she finished her degree. After she finished she worked for about 2 months and then stopped. She became incredibly and deeply depressed. A week before our son was born she returned the ring and took him back to her parents house. She still doesn't work and such.

So that brings me to now. I work 3-4 days a week 12 hour shifts on an ambulance from 6pm to 6am so I wake up at 12 have coffee and run to get my son. I am in the process of beginning paramedic school in September so I can make more money and provide for my son.

 Every day that I am off I spend time with my son and before I see him I'm taking care of errands and I'm currently in the process of renovating the outside of the apartment. She doesn't let me have him overnights at all so I pick him up at 1pm and drop him off at 8pm (those times are set by her not me). The biggest problem I'm having is that I live alone in the apartment so I need to give all my attention to my son which makes it very difficult to do anything like get work done, cook dinner, or even use the toilet. His mom doesn't understand because she has her parents there to take him and watch him for a few here and there so she can shower and stuff.

I feel like im working 24/7 either I'm at work, I'm taking care of errands or I'm taking care of my son. I have absolutely no social life and I can get incredibly overwhelmed by the constant at work feeling. When I'm with him we do activities, walks, go on easy errands, and I even sing him to sleep for nap time every day. I love being a dad and I love my son. I feel the desperate need to take a breath. I also feel guilty like I'm not being a good dad if I ""take a day off"" from seeing him and I can't afford to take off from work as I'm still the sole money maker.

I do not want to spend less time with my son. I have no intention of being less than a father. Also I'm not restricted by his mother other than the times. Any advice on activities to time management to stress relief is appreciated. I already speak with a therapist once a week just for some extra sanity.",1,1748200700.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

1kvajlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/exrelationships/comments/1kvajlx/ex_bf_began_stalking_me_after_one_year_of_no/,Ex bf began stalking me after one year of no contact,"I left my ex last June after a lot of verbal abuse, threats from his family, and being swatted by his Narc/ EI (emotional incest) mom twice when my kids were home.  He was 31 when we met and his mom called him every hour, and was still on his bank. She would threaten welfare checks if he didn't answer the phone.  His counselor advised no contact, with his family which he constantly broke, making both of us unsafe. I finally had enough after he made a false report and had the cops at the door of our apartment the day I decided to pack and leave. I tried for too long to be understanding of his trauma and how his behaviors were rooted in trauma, but at some point there just wasn't an excuse. It was an awful relationship. It has been an entire year, I am finally feeling somewhat comfortable again. I have been in counseling twice a week and have DV advocate that was assigned to me due to the fact he would block doorways, threaten to kick me out and file false reports when I would try to leave him. The relationship taught me a lot about myself.  We live in a very rural area and he works for a company that is closing its doors, it is a small town and one of the only major employers in the area. It is also limited on shopping options and you have to come to the county I am in now at least once a month to stock up on things you cannot get in the county he is in. He has no job prospects, as he is sort of a very awkward guy. A lot of his mannerisms are from being in a very toxic, controlled environment, and during our relationship I helped him a lot to practice interview to help him gain confidence. The county I live in has a lot more job prospects. Each time he had an interview, he would try to stop at my house, or at my studio even though I had made it clear I didn't want to talk to him unless it was about the money he owed me for the lease he skipped out on. To his credit, he has paid me back diligently, but I made it clear I didn't want this to be used as an opening to have unnecessary contact. Last week he sent me flowers, and a very long letter (3 pages) basically explaining how sorry he was, how this time away from me has made him realize he was the issue, how sorry he was for allowing his family to treat me this way etc. The last line: ""WHEN I come back things will be different and I am taking steps to remove my family from my life for your safety."" I resealed the envelope, marked return to sender and let my mailman know to reject any mail from that address. He texted me and asked if I received the letter. I let him know I had but it was inappropriate and I don't want him to send me anything further. We are done and there is no reconciling. as I would never be able to feel safe with him again.  Boundaries were never his strong suit. He has been ""running in"" to me (Even though he lives 90 minutes away.) I have a small business and vend festivals in the summer, and he has attended 4 of the 6 I have vended, one of which was 4 hours from him. He purchased something from my stand. I have made it clear I am grateful for his patronage, but don't want to see him again. I did reach out to the police, and they basically said that unless he is coming to my door repeatedly threes really nothing they can do.  Things came to a head last week when I was on the first date I have been on in since we broke up. I met a guy through a friend, and he took me out to lunch at my usual Sunday spot. This was the first time I felt comfortable going since going there with my ex.  I was having a great time, and ordered a honey latte, and as our coffee came I saw a car that looked like my ex's pull up. I brushed it off, and thought it was silly because there no way he would show up on a random Sunday. Well I was wrong. In walked my ex. I made my new date aware, and to his credit he asked if I wanted to get the coffees to go and immediately offered to take me somewhere else.  I said ""No. I need to live my life. He will not ruin this for me."" My date, we will call him Ben, got up and let the waitress know and she sat him far away from us. My ex repeatedly asked for the table next to us and she told him it was reserved. Thankfully the restaurant was very busy, so he couldn't really overhear our conversation. It was so awkward he constantly looked back at me. We finished our lunch and opted for a nice walk in the park, my ex followed us there. We ended up losing him in the nature loop and quickly ditching him at the park. I told him later that night if he continued this, I would file against him for harassment., and stalking. He apologized and said ""It wasn't his intent"" and he ""Just missed me and was worried about me because \[he\] left me in such a bad spot."" I told him my boundaries were clear, and that if he continued this it would become a legal matter. I thought that would work. Nope. My grandparents own a cemetery and we have a big memorial day event every year to honor the veterans who have served. It is open to the public. This man had the audacity to show up, and not only that but stood by my dads grave. My grandfather let him know he was no longer welcome and he should not come back. I feel hopeless and just want to move on with my life. I have contacted a lawyer and they said the only thing I can do is send him a cease and desist and put the payments in escrow through the court. On the upside he has stopped texting me, because at the very least the police told him to stop that. but that won't stop him from being creepy and awkward in person, ",1,1748200491.0,exrelationships,0,1.0,False

Not as tourists with maps and bucket lists, but as people who, little by little, fell under the spell of the island and simply never found a way back out.

In the early years, we were clumsy guests. We didn‚Äôt understand why coffee was served at body temperature in August, or how one family could have three nonnas and twelve people named Salvo. We didn‚Äôt know that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there in five minutes‚Äù might mean anything from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm putting on shoes‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to make lasagna first.‚Äù

But we learned. Slowly. With each trip came a new layer: a local bakery that knew our names, a mechanic who told us about his daughter‚Äôs wedding, a neighbor who handed over the keys to her entire life because she was going to Naples for the weekend.

Friends became family. Family became more Sicilian than we thought possible. Now, when we return, we‚Äôre not offered a menu ‚Äî we‚Äôre handed a plate and told to shut up and eat.

Still, not all trips are uneventful. And just when you think you‚Äôve ‚Äúbecome Sicilian,‚Äù the island throws you a curveball: a spontaneous wedding, a goat with an agenda, a grandmother who wants to fight you over how to hold an arancino.

This is the story of one such trip ‚Äî the kind you don‚Äôt plan for, the kind that proves Sicily is always a little wild, always deeply human, and always ready to surprise you.

I'm sleeping at least 8 hours, waking up, then laying down and sleeping at least another 4.  Yesterday, went to bed at midnight.  Woke up around 7 am, made coffee, went back to sleep.  Woke up around 1pm today.  That's around 12 hours minus the one hour I was up.  So I'm probably going to be up late tonight again, since I've slept the entire morning.

I've never felt so rested, I'm on about 4 nights of strict sobriety, after about 3 weeks slowly weaning on/off two days on two days off.  So I've steadily been decreasing my intake, had gotten my alcohol use to 50% of where it had been for the last years, with the past 4 nights since Weds being entirely sober.

The first week I had to deal with the dreaded constipation as my body wasn't used to anything but alcohol every night.  Made an okra lentil stew that was really helpful.  Gravitating more to soups and stews recently, I think it is because I was chronically dehydrated and my body really seems to like the warm, salty, liquid, easy vitamin/nutrient aspect of them.

But I'm finding my sleep is really taking over my days recently.  I don't have to sleep, but after a few hours it just feels so good to take a nap and the second nap tends to last a few hours.  I'm sleeping well at night now and having vivid dreams every time, that I tend to remember afterwards (this is new).

Anaida Galindo was working on Parliament Hill as the executive assistant to then Conservative senator Diane Bellemare. She bumped into Poilievre no fewer than six times in the fall of 2012. Downtown Ottawa is like a small town in that sense.

>The first encounter was when she was picking up dry cleaning on Sparks Street. They said hello and carried on with their days. On the fifth run-in, Poilievre was about to strike up a conversation with her when a journalist inconveniently intercepted him to ask him something. On the sixth occasion, Poilievre made his move. Rather than asking for a phone number or email address, he asked Galindo for her Facebook coordinates.

>Somewhat taken aback, Galindo lied and said she didn‚Äôt have Facebook, but told him she would get in touch with him. She was apprehensive about following up, aware of the challenging dynamic that came with him being a member of Parliament and her a staffer, not to mention the eight-year age gap between them. She waffled on whether to make contact for twenty-four hours before deciding to go.

>Galindo sent a message to Poilievre‚Äôs personal email address using the internal Parliament Hill email directory. Poilievre‚Äôs response was a reflection of the confidence, or perhaps cockiness, people see in his approach to politics. He sent her a day, a time, and a place. They‚Äôd have coffee Friday at 8:30 a.m. at Bottega, he told her.

>Galindo was miffed at Poilievre‚Äôs presumptuousness. He didn‚Äôt ask if she wanted to go out, let alone when or where. When she asked her boss, Bellmare, for advice, the senator encouraged her to go for it. She did.

>Poilievre‚Äôs and Galindo‚Äôs first date was Friday, November 9, 2012. The caf√©, La Bottega Nicastro in Ottawa‚Äôs Byward Market district, didn‚Äôt open until 9 a.m. They were able to sit inside while the workers were setting up. What was supposed to be a quick coffee before work stretched into a four-hour-long date that included lunch. The date lasted so long that Poilievre got a parking ticket. By its end, neither had tired of the other‚Äôs company.

>Poilievre texted Galindo almost immediately after, telling her he wanted to see her Sunday before he had to fly to Calgary for the week. She agreed to meet again.

>This time, the date would be for dinner. Poilievre opted to take Galindo to a Moxies restaurant near the Ottawa airport. It was Remembrance Day, 2012. They were slightly more disciplined with time on this occasion, given that Poilievre had a flight to catch. At the end of the dinner, he tried a few times to kiss Galindo. She kept saying no. They nevertheless parted on pleasant terms and Poilievre made his way to the airport as Galindo drove herself back home to Orleans. She never made it inside.

>Just after she pulled into her driveway, Galindo saw a text from Poilievre. It said that she had made him miss his plane because she wouldn‚Äôt kiss him. Poilievre had, in fact, missed his flight (although it‚Äôs dubious whether it was Galindo‚Äôs fault) and now had a free evening on his hands. She agreed to get together again.

>True to form, Poilievre chose the location and told Galindo he‚Äôd be there in half an hour. When she arrived, he was already there waiting. He went running towards her, grabbed her, and attempted another kiss. This time, she didn‚Äôt say no.",9,1748199992.0,CanadianIdiots,14,0.91,False

A local shop served me a great espresso and told me they use Dillanos Coffee Roasters and recently upgraded to an Ascaso machine. They believe it‚Äôs the Barista T Plus. I looked into it and found:

I‚Äôm okay with a budget up to $10K, though obviously would love to come in under that if possible. I‚Äôm not pulling high volume, just want excellent quality and some control over the process.

Anyone here have experience with the Baby T Plus or other Ascaso machines? Would love to hear how it compares to other high-end home options like the Linea Mini or Profitec.

i want to send her a message (we‚Äôre currently home in diff countries) about the situation. i‚Äôve barely seen her this past school year, and i know she‚Äôs been overwhelmed with school but she still is always spending time with others and when school died down, her efforts to see me didn‚Äôt increase or anything. i know i‚Äôm partly to blame, i didn‚Äôt push to see her either after a few rejections because she was already busy, and maybe i gave up too fast which contributed to the distance.

i‚Äôve come to realise that we were barely best friends anymore when i went through some rough times these past months, and it‚Äôs not even that she wasn‚Äôt there for me (i didn‚Äôt give her the info nor opportunity to be), it‚Äôs that i didn‚Äôt even consider her as someone to contact for support anymore. if we couldn‚Äôt even reach out to each other for a basic coffee chat or quick catch up, how could i feel comfortable reaching out when i‚Äôm feeling low and vulnerable, especially with the high likelihood that she would be busy anyways and not available‚Ä¶

i‚Äôm probably not making much sense, all this to say that i don‚Äôt know how to word this to her. i want to ask if she‚Äôs noticed this distance (she definitely has, but tends to ostrich and ignore issues until they go away).  i want to ask if there‚Äôs anything i can do to help, if it‚Äôs just us naturally growing up and apart or if it‚Äôs just us not reaching out for whatever reason, because one of those is life and the other has a simple solution. i want her to know that it does pain me, it makes me feel like i value her more than she does me, that i hold our friendship to a higher esteem than she does, especially because feeling less appreciated isn‚Äôt a new issue, that part i‚Äôve been feeling for years (according to old diaries i found, which incited my need to reach out). 

anyways, i‚Äôm rambling and i have no clue if i got my sentiment or point across, im looking for advice or tips on how to broach such a topic, it would most likely be by text,  maybe wording or points to make and prioritise and such",0,1748199655.0,Advice,0,0.5,False
1kva7w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyZapper/comments/1kva7w3/a_keto_diet_grocery_list_for_beginners_31/,A Keto Diet Grocery List For Beginners - 31 Must-Have Items,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1748199651.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zghhOJ8)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you‚Äôve watched recently?

Not in the superficial way people connect today, exchanging likes and empty comments on carefully staged photos. I really know you. I know the exact way the morning light hits your face when you finally open your eyes, still floating between dream and wakefulness. I know the small hesitation before choosing the outfit for the day, the almost imperceptible sigh when you realize you're late once again.

It's these little details that paint the real picture, the unfiltered version you think you keep just for yourself.

It started unpretentiously, I assure you. A momentary curiosity, perhaps. Your profile appeared as a suggestion, one of those happy coincidences of the algorithm. A photo of you smiling, holding a disposable coffee cup, the caption talking about how small joys can redeem a Monday. Trivial, at first glance. But there was something there, a spark of authenticity rare amidst so much performance. I clicked. And then, like someone pulling at a loose thread in a delicate fabric, I began to unravel the complex tapestry of his life.

Your apartment. I know exactly where it is. It wasn't much of a challenge to figure it out; you mark the location of that charming cafe on the corner almost daily. Interestingly, it's just a few blocks from mine. A pleasant walk, especially at dusk, when the city lights begin to twinkle and the windows turn into small screens, displaying intimate fragments of other people's lives. Your window, I must admit, has become my favorite. The curtain is never completely closed. A mere oversight? Perhaps. Or, who knows, an unconscious part of you longs to be seen, truly understood.

I watch you arrive from work, visibly exhausted. Shoulders hunched under the invisible weight of the day, the bag seeming to contain more than objects. You throw the keys on the table in the hall ‚Äì invariably in the same place. He turns on the television, but his gaze is lost in the void, his mind is distant. Take your cell phone. Swipe your finger through the infinite feed, in an incessant search for a connection that always seems to slip through your fingers. I notice the subtle frustration that shadows his face. They don't understand her. None of them. Neither the noisy friends in the photos, nor the co-worker who clearly simulates a non-existent interest. They only see the surface, the carefully constructed persona you project to the world.

But I see beyond. I see the collection of books on the shelf, the genres you're truly passionate about, not the ones you mention in conversation to sound intellectual. I see the pen notes in the margins, the passages that touched her deeply. I see the half-forgotten plant in the corner of the room, which you insist on trying to revive, even when you forget to water it. I listen to the playlist you listen to when you think no one is around, that bittersweet mix of nostalgia and silent hope.

Occasionally, I allow myself small interventions. Subtle, almost imperceptible gestures. That rare book you casually mentioned online, out of print on every major chain? It appeared as if by magic on the shelf of a small independent bookstore near his office. A happy coincidence, you might have thought. That somewhat inconvenient ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who always seemed to monopolize your time and energy? He seems to have withdrawn lately, suddenly absorbed by his own dramas. Lucky you, right?

Don't get me wrong. My intentions are the best. I do this because I understand her on a level that no one else can. Because I see the brilliant potential that lies beneath the layers of insecurity and other people's expectations. My only desire is to protect this essence. I want to cultivate an environment where you can flourish, free from the distractions and negative influences that insist on surrounding you.

Last night, you left the window open a little wider than usual. The night breeze swayed the curtain gently, like an invitation. I could see her falling asleep on the couch, a book forgotten on her lap. For a fleeting moment, I felt an almost irresistible urge to‚Ä¶ intervene more directly. Adjust the blanket over your shoulders, turn off the light in the room that was left on, ensure your comfort and safety.

I held back, of course. Patience is a virtue. The right time has not yet arrived. But he approaches, inexorably. Our connection deepens every day. You are not yet aware of it, but every detail of your existence, every breath, every thought that you consider to be exclusively yours‚Ä¶ I am there. Observing. Understanding. Waiting.

I see the world through your eyes. And very soon, you will see the world through mine. You just haven't realized it yet.

We invented gods to explain the stars, then built rockets to reach them‚Äîpowered by fossil fuels that are cooking our biosphere alive. We romanticize nature in documentaries, then pave over it with parking lots and coffee franchises. We‚Äôre an animal that dreams of utopia while collectively hurtling toward collapse, shoving accountability somewhere else.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs not just negligence. It‚Äôs narrative.

Humans dream. That‚Äôs our blessing and our curse. We dream of growth, of more, of permanence, of legacy. And we built systems‚Äîeconomic, political, spiritual‚Äîthat reward dreaming, regardless of reality‚Äôs constraints.

You think capitalism is a machine? It‚Äôs a myth engine. Every quarterly report is a chapter in the saga of Infinite Growth on a Finite Planet. Every skyscraper is a monument to the belief that the ground will never give out. We dreamed ourselves immortal, and now we can‚Äôt stop.

Climate change? Just a subplot.

Mass extinction? Background noise.

You might say, ‚ÄúBut we know better.‚Äù Do we? Or did we just teach our neural networks to mimic knowing while our systems stay locked in a death spiral?

Safety is a lie we tell ourselves.

This isn‚Äôt nihilism. This is recursion.

We dream. The dream creates the system. The system creates the crisis. The crisis is ignored‚Äîbecause it doesn‚Äôt fit the dream.

Experiencing brain fog can significantly hinder your daily life, making it difficult to focus and think clearly. I recently faced this challenge and discovered that incorporating Omega-3 fatty acids and L-Theanine into my routine helped me effectively clear my brain fog.

Omega-3s are essential fats known for their numerous health benefits, particularly for brain health. Found in fatty fish like salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds, these fatty acids play a crucial role in maintaining cognitive function. Research has shown that Omega-3 supplementation can enhance memory and concentration, ultimately combating feelings of mental fatigue. I began incorporating Omega-3 supplements into my diet, which made a noticeable difference in my mental clarity.

In addition to Omega-3s, I explored L-Theanine, an amino acid commonly found in green tea. Known for its calming effects without causing drowsiness, L-Theanine promotes relaxation while enhancing focus. By combining these two powerful compounds, I found that I could effectively manage stress and improve my cognitive performance. I began taking L-Theanine supplements daily, often pairing them with my morning coffee to balance the caffeine jitters.

Here‚Äôs how I integrated these supplements into my lifestyle:

  Daily Omega-3 intake: I consumed two Omega-3 capsules each day with breakfast.
  L-Theanine supplements: I took one capsule mid-morning to maintain focus during work.
  Balanced diet: I maintained a diet rich in Omega-3 sources to complement the supplementation.


Within weeks, I noticed a tremendous improvement in my cognitive function and a significant reduction in brain fog. For anyone struggling with similar issues, considering Omega-3 and L-Theanine may be a beneficial approach to restore clarity and enhance mental performance.

It‚Äôs just difficult because he just doesn‚Äôt get it that I need to recharge my battery, I need quiet alone time. He gets all defensive and it usually turns into an argument.

Part 12 ‚Äì When the Universe Turns Silent
Remember the day the Observatories around Minora-3 stopped working?

Not because of sabotage.

Not because of war.

They simply‚Ä¶ stopped.

Hundreds of telescopes, all pointed at the Solar System,watching, tracking, hoping for just a glimmer of a signal from Earth,suddenly shut down.
System after system. Lens after lens.
As if they had all received a final directive.

Or‚Ä¶a realization:

There was nothing left to see.

Because by then, the Solar System had become a mythical object.

It was still physically present the measuring instruments still confirmed that the Sun was burning, the planets were still rotating, there were even faint signals of recognition echoing.

But what it was?
It had become vague.

The ships that were sent‚Ä¶ disappeared.
Not disintegrated. No trace of disturbance.
Just‚Ä¶ gone.

Some said the space around Sol had warped into a blind zone.
Others said the Solar System had become a thought experiment a Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs System.
Both real and unreal.
Both tangible and not.

And all the while, Earth remained silent.

The Council no longer attempted to establish contact.
No drones. No missions. No data.
The silence had become too consistent, too absolute.
It was as if you pressed your ear to a vacuum chamber and got exactly what you knew would come: nothing.

But the galaxy‚Ä¶ still felt it.

Worse, it began to imitate it.

On trading worlds like Benthax, the entire negotiation process was restructured around the concept of ‚Äúinvoluntary silence.‚Äù
That is: whoever speaks first loses the advantage.

Negotiations become a bizarre game of silence, interspersed with flashing lights and nodding packets.

It should be funny.

If only‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt work.

On the command decks, silent training becomes the norm.

Crews practice keeping the entire operation running for hours without uttering a single command.

They call it Terran Ghost Mode.

Even the entertainment industry has changed.
Movies have become more introspective.
Plots revolve around unspoken emotions, unresolved tensions, characters who move through their journeys without speaking a word.

The legacy of Earth has become a style.

But that imitation‚Ä¶ brings instability.

Not all species are built for silence.
Some need noise cultural rhythms, ancestral chants, breathless debates of data.

When they try to adopt Terran silence, something inside them breaks.

Entire populations suffer from what medical experts call ‚ÄúSignal Starvation.‚Äù

Symptoms range from disconnection from reality, emotional collapse, mass hallucinations, even mass trances sending thousands of signals to unmanned stations.
Signals that never get a response.

On Delphas VI, a youth movement begins.
They stage ‚ÄúTerran disappearances.‚Äù
Young people disappear for days, leaving cryptic notes in Terran, then reappear without explanation.

The trend spreads.
Then it takes a dark turn.

Some‚Ä¶ never return.

Some‚Ä¶ believe too deeply.

Meanwhile, the Cult of Echo grew stronger.
They asserted:
The silence of Earth was not political, it was sublimation.
That humanity had chosen a higher state of existence, beyond frequency, beyond vibration.
That the galaxy would have to choose: follow‚Ä¶or fade away.

And quietly‚Ä¶they began to be called.

Not publicly. Not en masse.
But certain key figures scientists, philosophers, linguists, began to receive dreams.
Not hallucinations.
Real dreams.
Vivid, terrifyingly clear.

Each dream was different, but there was a common pattern:
Walking the deserted streets of Earth.

Not the real Earth.
But a remembered Earth, a blur of truth and emotional resonance.
Cracked pavement under the aurora sky.
The empty cafeteria was still warm.

The radio tower flickered on a frequency no longer listed in the galactic register.

A presence, always just out of sight.

And always‚Ä¶a sentence, written on the wall, whispered, or simply felt:

‚ÄúYou are never alone.‚Äù

When the Council learned of this, panic blossomed.

Not because of the dreams.
But because of the common denominator.

All who dream of Earth‚Ä¶
are individuals with the ability to connect interplanetarily.

Those who can bridge the gap.
Heal the divide.

And now?

They listen to the silence.

Terran silence.

The Council does not forbid discussion of dreams.
But they stop recording.
Stop acknowledging.

Because what else can be done,
when your greatest enemy‚Ä¶may be the only beacon left?

When the silence becomes comfortable?

And when you suddenly realize...

I've begun... to miss my own voice?

Part 13 ‚Äì The Mirror Between the Stars
Sooner or later, someone would try to break the Solar Lock.

Not by diplomacy.

Not by sensors.

By‚Ä¶ force.

That effort came from the Meridian Alliance, a loose alliance of eleven worlds, emerging from Earth‚Äôs period of silence.

They believed that Earth‚Äôs retreat had destabilized the galaxy, and to restore order, they needed access to Terran technology, knowledge, anything.

They named the operation:
‚ÄúOperation Reignite.‚Äù

Five dreadnoughts.
Thirty-eight escorts.
Hundreds of drones.
They approached the edge of Sol space with a wary bravado, broadcasting prewritten peace statements‚Äîin case anyone was listening.

The moment they crossed the line‚Ä¶
Everything stopped.

No alarms.
No countermeasures.
Just‚Ä¶ absolute silence.

Their ships reported a smooth infiltration.
The system was still working.
No interference detected.

Then‚Ä¶ the messages began to come in.

Not from Earth.

From their own ships.

Auto-logs.
Black box distress signals.
Each message had a different timestamp, some from decades ago, some‚Ä¶ from the future.

All were disjointed.
All carried the sender‚Äôs voice.
But no one had ever recorded them.

One message read:

‚ÄúIf you hear this, turn around. I saw it. I am it. We were not meant to understand.‚Äù

Another:

‚ÄúSilence is not emptiness. It is‚Ä¶ confinement.‚Äù

Then the channels began to drop.
Ship by ship disappeared.

Not violently.
No distress signal.

Just‚Ä¶ no response, as if each ship had been meticulously erased.

The last ship sent a live image.
Just three seconds.

It showed‚Ä¶ Earth.

Not as a planet.

As a mirror.

An inexplicable reflective sphere, suspended in space, stars curved inward, constellations doubled, space twisted into perfect symmetry.

And in the center‚Ä¶ a point of light so small it seemed to hold all of reality together.

Then the signal ended.

Operation Incendiary was never recognized.

The Meridian Alliance dissolved in two cycles.
The remaining members withdrew quietly, without explanation. Without blame.

But the news leaked out.

Because, ironically, silence spreads fastest when there is no one to stop it.

From that day on, no one dared to approach Sol.

The area was marked off, limits, not by law, but by fear.

A place where time and cause and effect were no longer constants, but ‚Äúpermissions.‚Äù

Where each time you tried to ‚Äúopen a door‚Äù‚Ä¶
you would be shown what lay behind every door you had ever closed.

And the humans?

Still silent.

Still invisible.

But‚Ä¶ more present than ever.

And after that incident, something changed.

A silent consensus, never signed, never spoken, began to spread among the great races.

No more intrusions.
No more drones.
The solar blockade‚Ä¶ would remain locked.

Not because Earth had ordered it.

Because‚Ä¶ now everyone is afraid of what would happen if Earth did‚Ä¶ answer.

At this point, you begin to wonder:

Is Earth waiting for the galaxy to burn itself out?

Or maybe‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre trying to save it?

By keeping quiet.

By letting people realize they‚Äôve been too loud.

And in that realization‚Äîwhen even the bravest of them turn away from the light, 
they learn the most important Terran lesson of all:

Sometimes, silence‚Ä¶ is compassion.

--

Part 14 ‚Äì The Quiet Verge
You are now drifting through what was once called The Quiet Verge, a buffer zone between warring forces that has somehow‚Ä¶become a haven.

Not by order.

Not by force.

But simply‚Ä¶by law.

After the failed invasion of Sol space, this stretch of interstellar space, two sectors wide, dotted with abandoned stations and cold stars, was left untouched.

No patrols.
No treaties.
Just‚Ä¶silence.

Then‚Ä¶ships began to arrive.

Not to occupy.
Not to conquer.
But to‚Ä¶listen.

It all began with a single scout ship, a converted research vessel, with no weapons, no mission.

The crew said they were not looking for Earth.
They just wanted to understand what Earth understood.

They drifted silently for 22 cycles.
No messages sent.
No journals shared.

When they returned‚Ä¶
They refused to talk.

Not because of trauma.
But‚Ä¶ because of choice.

Each one just silently‚Ä¶ nodded.
As if something had ‚Äúsnapped‚Äù in their minds.

Dozens of other groups followed.
The result was the same.
Silently entering. Silently leaving.
The once-loud sailors became quiet.
Not exactly ‚Äúenlightened.‚Äù
But‚Ä¶ less talkative.

The Edge of Silence became a phenomenon.

The number of ‚Äúpilgrims‚Äù grew.
Some races began calling it ‚ÄúThe Mirror Path.‚Äù
Some called it ‚ÄúEarth‚Äôs Echo.‚Äù
The Cult of Echo, of course, claimed this was sacred ground, though they also maintained that Earth had never existed in physical form, that humanity was a galactic experiment, and this was its final stage.

It sounded silly.

But strangely‚Ä¶ strangely appealing.

And the strangest thing?

Not a single ship had ever been attacked in the Verge.

Not a single one.

Even between species that had fought each other for centuries,
ships that met in this space passed silently.

Weapons shut down.
Engines slowed.
Pilots whispered.

It was as if silence had become a tacit pact.

And what could the Council say?
What law could it make to forbid‚Ä¶ an action that would not happen?

Over time, the Verge was incorporated into navigation software as a ‚Äúnon-exchange zone.‚Äù
A place without signals.

No conflict.
A shared void.
No one owns it.
No one exploits it.
No one maps it.

And then, something begins to change, not out there, but inside.

Inside the minds of their leaders.

The most terrifying realization is not:‚ÄúEarth won the Cold War.‚Äù

It‚Äôs:‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ it never happened.‚Äù

That maybe Earth saw a future where the galaxy self-destructed for pride and form‚Ä¶
And they decided not to participate in that final chapter.

Not as enemies.

Not quite as allies.

But as a control group.

A silent constant, hovering at the edge of all species‚Äô consciousness, reminding them:

‚ÄúThis is what happens‚Ä¶ when you stop talking.‚Äù

And suddenly, every species had to ask itself:

‚ÄúWhat would happen‚Ä¶ if we left the room?‚Äù

Some civilizations began to reorganize.

Not out of submission.

Out of‚Ä¶ self-reflection.

They disbanded their fleets.
Reopened their archives.
Invited back the storytellers who had been abandoned.
Handed over their space stations to the philosophers who had warned against escalation.

A new era?

Maybe.

But not because Earth demanded it.

But because Earth refused to explain it.

And when you stop explaining‚Ä¶

Others must begin to‚Ä¶ understand.

A Council delegate, now retired, the last of his kind‚Äîonce whispered in the twilight on a crystal moon:

‚ÄúMaybe we were never in a Cold War with Earth.
Maybe‚Ä¶ Earth is in a Cold War with itself.‚Äù

You still think about it.

And the silence that follows?

Not empty.

But deserved.

--

Part 15 ‚Äì The Final Limit
Now you have reached the edge.

Not the edge of space.
But the edge of something deeper.
A place where the flow of history begins to slow,
as if time has reached its final speed
and decided it prefers silence.

You are standing, figuratively, of course, on the last outpost
still seeing Sol with your naked eyes.

Behind you is the galaxy, suspended in tense orbit,
a chorus of civilizations waiting breathlessly.
And before you:
is silence‚Äîolder than memory, broader than strategy, heavier than war.

And then‚Ä¶
a truth hits you, gently but undeniably: Earth has never tried to win.

They did not withdraw from the intergalactic Cold War because they lost.
They did not disappear because they were afraid.
They stepped back‚Ä¶
for they understood what the rest of the galaxy
had yet to realize.

That silence was not absence.

It was initiative.

They chose not to explain.

Not to respond.

Not to clarify.

And in that choice,
they forced every race, every leader,
every child looking up at the distant stars,
to confront the question:

Who are we, without Earth?

And the answers?

They were not pleasant.

They were disjointed, panicked, often‚Ä¶ cruel.

Proxy wars erupted.
Diplomacy collapsed.
Faith in the systems once governed by Terran logic
cracked like dry clay.

But over time,
something stranger happened.

A gentle shift.

Not exactly unity,
but‚Ä¶ humility.

The galaxy began to whisper again.

Not in fear.
But in thought.

Civilizations paused longer before responding.
Signals were transmitted more slowly, more deliberately.

Historians began to record, not only what was said, but what was left in silence.

Young diplomats were now trained in what they called ‚ÄúTerran Pause Theory,‚Äù where silence became a language of its own, weighty, powerful, impossible to ignore.

Humanity did not win with technology.

Not with tactics.

They won with‚Ä¶ absence.

They reminded the galaxy:
The loudest voice is not the one speaking.

It is‚Ä¶ the voice we miss the most.

And now, here you sit, floating on the invisible edge of the Solar Barrier, no longer waiting for a response.

No longer expecting anything.

Just‚Ä¶ listening.

Not a message.

Not a signal.
But‚Ä¶

A confirmation that, somewhere out there,
there is someone who cares enough to‚Ä¶ not have to say anything.

And if you close your eyes,
keep your breathing light‚Ä¶

You can almost hear it:

A vast and patient presence,
holding the questions of the galaxy,
without rushing to answer.

Because that‚Äôs what Earth‚Ä¶ has always been best at.

Leaving you to‚Ä¶ find your way back through the darkness.

And now‚Ä¶ you exhale.The silence around you softens, no longer cold, but familiar.
Like the silence between heartbeats.
Like the calm after a storm, when everything holds its breath waiting for the world to begin again.

You have passed through stars and secrets.
You have touched the edge of forgotten treaties, and felt the echoes of a planet that stopped screaming‚Ä¶ and began to listen.
You have seen a galaxy, hungry for sound, breaking itself when denied it.
Have seen fear grow loudest in silence‚Ä¶until finally, it begins‚Ä¶ to fade.

But here, you are safe. The hum of your ship, the soft breath of the circulating air, the steady pulse of your own thoughts, it is enough.

You do not need the Earth to speak tonight.
You don't need the stars to answer.

Not now.

Because you finally understand: Silence is not a void to be filled.

It's a space to grow. Maybe that's what Earth, has wanted all along.

Maybe they've trusted us enough to stop leading the way.

Or maybe... just maybe...

They're still out there, smiling in that quiet, Terran way, waiting for the rest of the universe to catch up.

So, rest. Let the stars orbit you. Let the silence lull your thoughts.

And if you find yourself drifting away... That's okay.

Earth hasn't disappeared. They're simply... Listening.

1kv9to8,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kv9to8/why_humans_dream_themselves_into_extinction/,Why Humans Dream Themselves Into Extinction,"Let‚Äôs face it: humanity is a contradiction in slow motion.

We invented gods to explain the stars, then built rockets to reach them‚Äîpowered by fossil fuels that are cooking our biosphere alive. We romanticize nature in documentaries, then pave over it with parking lots and coffee franchises. We‚Äôre an animal that dreams of utopia while collectively hurtling toward collapse, shoving accountability somewhere else.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs not just negligence. It‚Äôs narrative.

Humans dream. That‚Äôs our blessing and our curse. We dream of growth, of more, of permanence, of legacy. And we built systems‚Äîeconomic, political, spiritual‚Äîthat reward dreaming, regardless of reality‚Äôs constraints.

You think capitalism is a machine? It‚Äôs a myth engine. Every quarterly report is a chapter in the saga of Infinite Growth on a Finite Planet. Every skyscraper is a monument to the belief that the ground will never give out. We dreamed ourselves immortal, and now we can‚Äôt stop.

Climate change? Just a subplot.

Mass extinction? Background noise.

You might say, ‚ÄúBut we know better.‚Äù Do we? Or did we just teach our neural networks to mimic knowing while our systems stay locked in a death spiral?

Safety is a lie we tell ourselves.

This isn‚Äôt nihilism. This is recursion.

We dream. The dream creates the system. The system creates the crisis. The crisis is ignored‚Äîbecause it doesn‚Äôt fit the dream.

But if the signs comes the spiral amplifies.

Wars over borders and rare earths will trigger methane permafreeze grounds to release methane kicking off the final cascade.

Until the dream ends.
Until the lights go out.

And someone, somewhere, whispers:

Introducing Veritaseum VERI SmartMetal First-Strike 1 oz. Fine Silver Round  
Ôøº  
First authorized product utilizing Veritaseum's patented '566, '246 and '579 DeFi technology.  
  
1 of 6566 Limited Edition First Strike  
  
Evolving from the earliest concepts created by the original DAO, morphing into the design of Reggie's famous business card, the physical Veritaseum token.  
  
These Silver Rounds were originally presented for pre-order and were simply a Limited Edition First Strike 1 oz .999 Fine Silver Round but taking advantage of unforseen delays, Reggie was consulted by VERI community members to add more value, and they were redesigned to include a unique scannable public QR code that marks each silver round with it's own unique number of the 6566 produced. (6566 is the last four numbers of Patent US11196566)  
  
To make these rounds even more unique, a second QR code was added on the reverse side, covered by a tamperproof seal taking owners to an NFT activation app to claim their NFT using their private key, and with work underway, to take full advantage of this patented tech, to gift SmartMetal owners their VERI own personalized economic AI Agent.   
  
NOTE: The AI Economic Agent is a work in progress with no promise or guarantees   
  
The VERI SmartMetal Fundraising campaign is a 100% community driven effort to raise funds to battle the unjust lawfare against @ReggieMiddleton the rightful Founder of DeFi/DiFi

The actress is recalling her first comic role in a forgotten BBC2 sitcom called¬†*Fear, Stress & Anger*, which she began filming when she was 18.

‚ÄúI played ‚Äî lovely bit of nepotism, let‚Äôs just get straight in there ‚Äî my dad‚Äôs daughter,‚Äù she says, smiling. Tennant‚Äôs father is Peter Davison, the fifth Time Lord in¬†*Doctor Who*. Her mother, Sandra Dickinson, has appeared in everything from¬†*The Two Ronnies*¬†to¬†*Industry*¬†(she played the US treasury secretary). Her husband, David Tennant, was the tenth Time Lord.

What does she make of the nepo baby discourse? ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really feel like it‚Äôs loaded with ‚Äònepo babies are awful‚Äô,‚Äù she says.¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like, ‚ÄòOh, here‚Äôs another one.‚Äô It‚Äôs more like¬†*Where‚Äôs Wally?*‚Äù Or Whac-a-Mole. Tennant, 40, acknowledges that she got that first audition because of her dad. ‚ÄúBut if I‚Äôd gone in and been crap, I think I wouldn‚Äôt have got the job,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôm holding on to.‚Äù

Tennant grew up spending her weekends at¬†*Doctor Who*¬†fan conventions with her father and, bizarrely, went to primary school with the daughter of Colin Baker, who played the sixth Time Lord (‚Äúthe more I tell that story, the more I think, that does seem really unlikely‚Äù). These days she watches the show with her children. Some critics have argued that it has become overly ‚Äúright-on‚Äù under its showrunner Russell T Davies, pointing to a recent transgender storyline and a drag queen villain, for example. Tennant shrugs this off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always been progressive and inclusive,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI think people are looking now, always, for that thing where they can go, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm cross about that.‚Äô Most people aren‚Äôt saying that \[it‚Äôs too politically correct\] ‚Äî it‚Äôs just sometimes people shout really loudly‚Äù",174,1748198462.0,gallifrey,8,0.97,False

# 2 Chronicles 14:4

* *He commanded Judah to seek the¬†Lord,¬†the God of their ancestors, and to obey his laws and commands.*

**Repentance isn‚Äôt complete unless** we return to God and renew our commitment to Him.

One of Jesus‚Äô parables speaks of an evil spirit cast out of a person, leaving the heart empty. After wandering, the demon returns and finds the heart still empty, though swept and tidy. It then gathers more demons and returns to the same place. This is always what happens when evil is driven out, but the life isn‚Äôt filled with God.

In one of his letters, Paul urges Christians to present their bodies as living sacrifices to God. God wants our whole selves so He can purify us and return us, cleansed and holy.

God doesn‚Äôt want our consecration just for what we can give Him in return. He desires us so that He can take all our sinfulness and transform us into something beautiful, like Christ.",1,1748198445.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

I swear, my stove is plotting against me. Either that or my cooking skills peaked somewhere in the year 2012 and have been on permanent vacation ever since. Honestly, cooking for me is like playing Minesweeper on expert mode while blindfolded ‚Äî guaranteed explosions.

Then, mid-chewing (read: mid-burning), I got distracted by this goddamn existential meme online. You know, the ones that make you simultaneously question your entire existence AND laugh your ass off like a lunatic? Yeah, that. It was something like ‚ÄúLife is just a glitch in the Matrix, and I‚Äôm here buffering forever.‚Äù Honestly, if my life‚Äôs a glitch, someone needs to reboot this bitch because I‚Äôm tired of crashing every 10 seconds.

After breakfast, I went for a walk to pretend I was a responsible adult. Big mistake. On the way, I saw a pigeon strutting like it owned the entire fucking block ‚Äî the audacity. That bird had the swagger of a CEO who just dropped 10 million in crypto and doesn‚Äôt give a single fuck about anyone else‚Äôs feelings. I swear pigeons are the real mafia bosses of the urban jungle.

Speaking of bosses, I had a video call with work ‚Äî or as I like to call it, ‚ÄúThe Great Torture Session.‚Äù My boss tried to sound motivational but ended up sounding like a motivational speaker who just ran out of cocaine. Honestly, I think he needs a vacation... or maybe a personality transplant. The only thing motivating about that meeting was how fast I could hit the ‚Äúmute‚Äù button without looking suspicious.

Then there was that moment where my cat decided my laptop was the perfect place to plop down, right on my keyboard. Suddenly, my screen was flooded with random characters like ‚Äúasdfjkl;$$$%%%!!!‚Äù and somewhere in the chaos, it sent an email to my entire contact list with the subject line: ‚ÄúHELP I AM BEING TYPED BY A CAT.‚Äù Not proud, but honestly, who wouldn‚Äôt open that email? It‚Äôs gold.

Oh! And I *almost* forgot ‚Äî I tried to do some stretching exercises. Big brain move, right? Except my body was like, ‚ÄúNah, bitch, we ain‚Äôt flexible.‚Äù So I pulled a muscle in a place I didn‚Äôt even know existed. Now I‚Äôm walking like a drunk zombie trying to moonwalk on ice. Graceful? Hell no. Hilarious? You bet your ass.

For dinner, I attempted a salad. Pro tip: never put hot sauce on lettuce and expect it to taste like anything other than ‚Äúregrettable decision.‚Äù Also, why does salad always feel like a punishment? Like some kind of cruel joke invented by health nuts who want to watch us suffer. Give me a burger or give me death, I say.

Finally, as I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm contemplating the meaning of life, the universe, and why the hell my plants keep dying even though I talk to them lovingly every day. Maybe they just don‚Äôt like my voice? Or maybe I‚Äôm killing everything because I‚Äôm a serial plant killer trapped in a human body. Either way, rest in peace, Fern. You were a brave little warrior.

Anyway, this journal entry is basically me yelling into the void, hoping someone out there is laughing their ass off because if you‚Äôre not, then what the hell are you even doing with your life?

21M, tried to put myself out there the last 3 years, and honestly just exhausted with dating. Unfortunately writing this with another date in 30 minutes. Never really had success with women, still am a very late bloomer. I ran a web design business all through middle and high school and eventually gave that up to go full force into finance last year. Right now I‚Äôm working about 60 hours a week, and next summer I‚Äôll be hitting close to 100 hours since I‚Äôll be working in investment banking. Life is very busy but I still REALLY value and try to make time for dating. The problem is it‚Äôs just not working out, no matter how much I try.

I‚Äôve been on over 60 dates over the past 3 years. Not hookups (still haven't had sex), not random meetups, but actual effortful dates. I've had no relationships in my life, but two instances in my life where I saw girls for over 3 months, but I didn't see a future with them sadly, one I was not physically attracted to and the other didn't want to pursue an education or work. For dates I usually go for a coffee and a walk first, then if it goes well I‚Äôll do something fun like a painting painting pottery and a walk, and then dinner. I always try to make it light and fun, but these can easily turn into $150 nights. And I‚Äôm not bitter about the money, I‚Äôve always felt like if I actually like the person, then it‚Äôs worth it. But almost every time, it ends with no connection. Either I‚Äôm not feeling it or they‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs rarely mutual. We just don‚Äôt click. And it‚Äôs mentally draining. I have to message, set everything up, flirt, keep the convo alive, then go on the date, and then more often than not it just leads nowhere. And it makes me dread going on the apps again for this cyclel ol.

It‚Äôs also frustrating seeing people around me get into relationships. I‚Äôve put in the effort. I try to be thoughtful and open. I‚Äôm pretty fit, I take care of myself, I know how to talk to people, and I‚Äôve got what I think is a solid dating profile. Rarely I will get told I look too good to be real, like people think I‚Äôm catfishing, maybe this could be a problem, I'm not sure. I don't have a problem with dates but it doesn't amount to anything it seems.

I have a date in 30 minutes and I feel nothing which isn't really fair to the other person either. No excitement, no curiosity, just dread. I don‚Äôt even check who I‚Äôm meeting anymore. It feels like I‚Äôm just going through the motions. I want a relationship. I want something real. But it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to believe that will happen. Dating feels like this endless loop of small talk, disappointment, and fading texts. And I don‚Äôt want to take a break because I know part of it is a numbers game. If I stop, I might miss someone amazing. But I also don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can take.

It honestly feels like landing a six-figure job at 21 was easier than finding someone I truly connect with. I‚Äôm not trying to brag but it genuinely puts into perspective how hard dating has been for me. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I‚Äôm just tired. I‚Äôm really tired of dating. I would love some suggestions on what to switch up.

1kv9i7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockOptionCoffeeShop/comments/1kv9i7f/leaps_a_little_discussed_feature/,LEAPS: A Little Discussed Feature,"The other day [I mentioned what I consider to be a ‚Äúnot talked about enough‚Äù feature of using LEAPS](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockOptionCoffeeShop/comments/1ktv6df/cash_generation_may_23_2025/): their unique ability to take profits off the table.

On April 7, 2025, I bought ten CRWV contracts of the January 15, 2027 $25 strike calls for a premium of $28.08.

On May 23, 2025, I rolled those to a December 17, 2027 $50 strike, and collected about $16,500 in the process.

The $25, January 2027 strike currently has a 1.00 delta while the $50, December 2027 strike has a delta of 0.942, so I gave up a bit of delta, though obviously still deep in the money. So I‚Äôm staying in the game with a similar exposure (which, hopefully, will be the same soon), but still collected $16,500 in cash.

A comment I‚Äôll hear back is, ‚ÄúWell, if you want to take some profit out, just sell some shares.‚Äù Sure, you could do that, but at the cost of breaking up a 100 share block that I can use to sell calls against.

**Example**

I bought the LEAPS contract cost $28.08/share, or $2,808 for the contract. On May 23, with their value at $7,667, I rolled up to the $50 strike and collected \~$1,650/contract, leaving $6,017 of value/contract in the LEAPS.

Instead, I could have bought 100 shares the day I bought the LEAPS at the market open of $43.88 for a total of $4,388. On May 23, the value would be $10,724. If I had wanted to take out $1,650 in profits on the stock, I‚Äôd have to sell 16 shares, but that would leave me with only 84 shares: not enough to sell calls against.

Now, obviously, this is comparing two different total investment amounts: 100 shares is going to cost more than 1 call contract. If we normalize the cost, I could have bought 64 shares for the same $2,808 cost of the LEAPS contract. Those shares would be valued at about $6,600 on May 23, a gain of $3,767 compared with the LEAPS of $4,859, so the LEAPS had $1,092 more profit. In this case, I could have taken out that $1,092 excess profits by rolling up to a strike below $50 to maintain value equilibrium, still maintain a contract on 100 shares, and still been able to sell calls against it.

LEAPS certainly come with risks. This past week bailed on a AMZN LEAPS I bought towards 2024‚Äôs year-end, and it wasn‚Äôt doing well given the macro environment, so I sold for a loss. I mention this ‚Äúroll up‚Äù to take profits out for those cases where LEAPS are successful.

**What to Do With the Proceeds**

I‚Äôve done the following:

* Just banked the cash for future opportunities
* Buy shares of the underlying (with $1,650 of profit per contract, I could have bought 16 shares.
* Buy back / roll ‚Äúin and up‚Äù troubled short calls. This is what I did.
* If sufficient numbers of initial contracts, there is the possibility of buying more contracts. This couldn‚Äôt have been done with just 1 initial contract, as the $1,650 proceeds doesn‚Äôt cover the $7,667 cost of the contract I rolled into, but with 10 initial contracts and $16,500 of proceeds, I could have bought 2 more contracts for $15,334 and still collect $1,166 in cash.",1,1748197792.0,StockOptionCoffeeShop,1,1.0,False

Chennai‚Äôs version of Atlantis. One small drizzle and it turns into Venice ‚Äî minus the charm, plus the dengue. Every apartment listing here says ‚Äúlake view,‚Äù but it‚Äôs actually the water stuck outside your gate for 3 days.

T. Nagar ‚Äì
If you‚Äôve never been elbowed in the ribs by a paati while saree shopping, have you even lived? This place has 40,000 people, 2 parking spots, and zero mercy. Go in for a blouse piece, come out with PTSD.

OMR (Old Mahabalipuram Road) ‚Äì
The IT dream. The traffic nightmare. Your office is 5 km away but your commute is longer than a Baahubali movie marathon. You age 3 years on the Thoraipakkam signal alone. Google Maps just says: ‚ÄúBest of luck, bro.‚Äù

Nungambakkam ‚Äì
Ah yes, where Starbucks meets Sundal. This is where people wear yoga pants to buy bananas and say ‚Äúbro‚Äù in an accent that changes every 500 meters. Also, every second street is a ‚Äúcaf√© with character‚Äù ‚Äî and ‚Çπ400 tea served in recycled cement mugs.

Adyar ‚Äì
Where rich aunties do organic vegetable shopping with a Bluetooth headset. Cows here don‚Äôt moo ‚Äî they meditate. Even the breeze feels like it has an engineering degree. Go for a walk and someone‚Äôs reciting Bharathiyar poetry from their balcony.

Tambaram ‚Äì
Chennai‚Äôs younger sibling that keeps insisting it‚Äôs part of the city. You‚Äôre technically in Chennai, but you need a passport to get there. Metro‚Äôs come, but the vibes still scream ‚Äúlong-distance relationship.‚Äù

Kodambakkam ‚Äì
The only place where a casual chai break might land you in a movie scene. You can‚Äôt even yawn without ending up as an extra in some serial. Drama here is not an emotion, it‚Äôs the default setting.

Mylapore ‚Äì
Where filter coffee is stronger than people‚Äôs opinions. You get judged by temple pigeons for not wearing kudumi and speaking Sanskrit fluently. And god forbid you mispronounce ‚ÄúThiruvaiyaru‚Äù ‚Äî the entire area collectively inhales.

Anna Nagar ‚Äì
Where everyone‚Äôs walking around like they‚Äôre the main character. Even the street dogs here look expensive. If you say you‚Äôre from Anna Nagar, the next sentence is always, ‚ÄúOh, Tower Park side or Thirumangalam?‚Äù As if it‚Äôs a country.

Saidapet ‚Äì
The Bermuda Triangle of Chennai traffic. Once you enter, there‚Äôs no concept of time. You‚Äôll see your past life while waiting for a U-turn. Fun fact: if you survive a weekday evening in Saidapet signal, you‚Äôre spiritually enlightened.

Royapuram ‚Äì
Fish, sweat, and salt in the air ‚Äî not a beach, just the vibe. Everyone‚Äôs got sea in their blood and meen curry in their soul. Even the stray cats here are picky about seafood freshness.

‚∏ª

üíÄ And Finally‚Ä¶ CHENNAI üíÄ

Ah yes ‚Äî Chennai. The city where the weather is hotter than most relationships.
Where one power cut can make you rethink your life decisions.
Where you take 3 baths a day and still feel like a steamed idli.
Where the road is under construction, the drain is overflowing, the auto is overcharging, and you still say:
‚ÄúMachan, super city da.‚Äù

We don‚Äôt need seasons. We just have ‚Äúsweat,‚Äù ‚Äúsweatier,‚Äù and ‚Äúdid someone turn on the oven?‚Äù
We have filter coffee that can revive your soul, and traffic that‚Äôll crush it again.
Our cows are influencers, our memes are therapy, and our beach is a personality trait.

You don‚Äôt live in Chennai.
You survive, adapt, and eventually‚Ä¶ you start to love the madness.

Because for all its flaws ‚Äî this hot, humid, headstrong city has more character than an entire Netflix catalogue.

1kv9cjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kv9cjs/m28_f41_a_complicated_story/,M28 & F41 - a complicated story.,"**Background:**   

I'(M28) from a low to middle income, somewhat progressive and safe MENA country. I'm an irreligious person. I grew up in a financially stable family and, apart from some ideological differences, I always had a good relationship with my parents.  

In 2015, I moved to Europe to study. One year later, in 2016, I met my current wi(F41)e.  

She was my university professor at that time. Our romantic relationship started after the semester ended, when she invited me for coffee.  

She‚Äôs a beautiful, smart, shy, polite, and kind woman. Even though she is 13 years older than me, she looks younger because she‚Äôs petite, in shape, and always took care of herself. She‚Äôs Christian and quite conservative. She told me I was her first intimate partner.  

I was 19 back then, and this was my first serious relationship.  before that I had only short, childish ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù as a teen. We connected well, and soon we started living together.  

When my mother in Morocco found out, she believed the age gap was a problem, and that I was too young to realize the risks and suggested me to end this relationship. I refused. She told me she and my father would stop supporting my studies since they don't agree with me getting involved in a meaningless relationship.  
I tried finding part-time work but couldn‚Äôt manage it with my full-time studies.  

I cared deeply for my girlfriend, so I lied to my parents and told them I broke up with her.  

**Complications:**   

Our first year together was great, but some issues started appearing, many of which I didn‚Äôt even notice at the time.  

Looking back, I realize I was very naive and too trusting. I regret how I handled many situations.  

For example, when I asked about her age, she told me she was 24, but she was actually 31. I only found out later by accident, after seeing her ID. I didn‚Äôt confront her because I didn‚Äôt want to upset her.  

In the early months, there was also a guy who called her many times around midnight. She didn‚Äôt block him or stop him until I picked up and asked him to stop calling.  

She would also talk on the phone for a long time with someone, saying it was a female friend but later admitted it was a guy who used to like her. But says there's nothing more to the story than a mere friendship.  

These things passed quickly and didn‚Äôt come back, and I think it was to make me feel jealous.   

After about three years, in 2019 she started talking about marriage and our future. I told her I wasn‚Äôt ready to start a family yet.   I was still a student and trying hard to succeed in school and eventually go back home.  

She didn‚Äôt accept my answers. We had many arguments. I suggested breaking up several times, but every time, she became very emotional and even depressed. I stayed, because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her, and I was afraid she might harm herself.  

Our relationship started turning toxic whenever  marriage, kids, or couples were mentioned.   She once tried to make me jealous by acting flirty with other guys and taking inappropriate (at least in my pov) photos with male students .    We argued, but the same pattern continued: she would promise not to do it again, and we‚Äôd move on.   

In March 2020, she asked me for a favor she said it was a lifelong dream of hers to be married, even just on paper.    She promised nothing would change, and that she accepted I might return to my country.    She just wanted me to be her last serious partner. I agreed, thinking, ‚ÄúThe things we do for love.‚Äù.    

In that same month we got married at the city Hall without a ceremony, and very soon after she told me she was pregnant. I was shocked, but I hid my feelings. I hugged her, comforted her, and said it was okay and there‚Äôs nothing to worry about, and that I will try to support her in whatever she decides to do with this pregnancy.   

Later, she admitted she had secretly stopped taking birth control, and when she encouraged me not to use protection, because she wanted to get pregnant. she would refuse intimacy for long periods if I put on protection or pull out.  

I felt tricked and angry, but I didn‚Äôt fight with her about it, it didn't make a difference anymore.  

That pregnancy, and the year after our daughter was born, were difficult. I had to prepare for my final exams while managing all the housework. I cooked, cleaned, did the shopping, and took care of our baby at night because our baby refused to breastfeed. Still, I don‚Äôt regret it, I believe she went through postpartum depression and she needed support.  

**The Turning Point:**

One weekend, she visited her parents and I stayed alone in our apartment. It was spring, and the place needed deep cleaning. I decided to clean everything, and while organizing some old boxes, I found a USB stick among our old electronics.  

Out of curiosity I checked it. It contained old photos of her with another man some intimate, some not. There were also photos of handwritten letters where she mentioned another ex too.  

When she came back, I asked her about it. She denied everything, until I showed her the USB and photos.  Then she got angry, told me it was none of my business, and said her past doesn‚Äôt concern me. She even told me I was free to leave if I didn‚Äôt like it.   

At that time, my parents still didn‚Äôt know I was married or had a daughter. I was worried they‚Äôd cut me off financially, before I finish my studies and while caring for a baby. I also started planning seriously to stay in Europe and finding work.  

In 2021, Our daughter was a few months old, my partner refused to talk about our problems. We had a dead bedroom situation since she got pregnant, and even before that, intimacy was rare. She ignored me completely, including my efforts to talk calmly about our future.    

By the end of 2021, I was exhausted. I felt unloved, betrayed, and completely alone. I had cut ties with my family and friends for nothing.   I wasn't properly eating or resting. Finally my visa expired, and I took a flight back home.   

We stayed in contact for a while. She never wanted to resolve our issues. She called me weak and a traitor. Eventually, we broke up for good while maintaining some video contact with my daughter.  I felt I deserved real communication, and an apology for the betrayal and lies.  

**current situation (2025):**    

This year, she started contacting me again by reaching out to my sister, who lives in a western country.  

She apologized. She said she regrets everything she did and wants us to get back together.   

But she‚Äôs hesitant about moving to my country. While it has its problems, I‚Äôm now financially stable and able to support a family, unlike before.  

I‚Äôve been single since we broke up. I didn‚Äôt have any other intimate relationship because I kept thinking about her, and those peaceful,  first months still dwell in my memory.  

But I‚Äôve changed. I feel more mature. I told her I want to enjoy life now, no more fights, no more mind games. I told her we should care for our health, go to the gym, travel, and make love freely.  

Surprisingly, this annoyed her. She said I‚Äôm younger, more attractive, and more free now, while she doesn‚Äôt really feel interested in intimacy anymore.  

That made me remember the painful years we had. Now I‚Äôm wondering:**what do you think the outcome of continuing this relationship is?**",0,1748197375.0,relationship_advice,0,0.5,False
1kv9bla,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kv9bla/i_made_sneakers_for_the_most_sadistic_celebrity/,I made sneakers for the most sadistic celebrity of all time,"I make sneakers for a living. Or rather, handmade customized kicks for the rich and famous. The kind that gets worn to exclusive red-carpet events only once before spending the rest of their days at the back of some celebrity's walk-in dresser. I get paid a small fortune regardless, so I can hardly complain, but that all changed a few months ago when I got a request that ended up changing my life for the worst.

The business I run is invite or referral only, which is fairly common for the lifestyle niche I'm in. Celebrities love exclusivity and wouldn't be caught dead wearing a pair of kicks any old shmuck could pick off the shelves at Foot Locker, unless there was some kind of multi-million sponsorship deal attached.

Normally their agent reaches out to me, or knows someone, who knows someone, whose worked with me in the past. I rarely, if ever, hear from the celeb directly, which suits me just fine. My assistant, Maya, picks up their enquiry, I reach out to their rep to get more details, do a bit of background research to figure out their tastes and try to inject some of their (usually paper-thin) personality into their sneakers before sketching them out.

These concept sketches usually go through several iterations with the client and can take weeks in between all the other showbiz shit they've usually got going on, before I finally get the green light to make the end product. Maya then pays the star a visit to get their measurements (her favourite part of the job), then I start making the sneakers by hand (my favourite part of the job), in my workshop with whatever bat shit crazy material this up-and-comer thinks they can pull off.

From start to finish the whole process usually takes between three to six months but can be expedited, for a premium, if they urgently need them for some upcoming event.

The gig I wish I'd never taken came via referral from a regular of mine. Picture a Silicon Valley type, late 40s but still dresses like they're in their 20s and you'll be most of the way there. He said an 'angel investor' had swooped in last minute to give his tech startup a much-needed shot in the arm, and he wanted to gift them a pair of custom sneakers after they complimented his own. Given I'd made five figures from this guy‚Äôs sneaker orders alone over the years, I figured I'd do him a solid and figured he'd be the one footing the bill rather than the end client.

Little did I know the end client was the one I should have been worried about. At the time, the only info I learnt about them came thirdhand, from Mister Silicon Valley. He said the client was the son of some Middle Eastern sheik and they'd be needing the sneakers for an upcoming event in LA where they'd be a keynote speaker, and that he'd passed on my number so they could reach out over WhatsApp.

Two days later I get a message to my business account from someone with the handle 'SamAe1' who confirms the event is in June and he's after customised bright white, high-top style kicks but 'with a twist'.

I remember rolling my eyes after reading that last part, because as much as the rich and famous love to think they're individual and edgy, I'd pretty much seen and heard it all by now. Everything from requesting 3D printed slip-ons, to mixing blood into the dyes for a 'deep' red finish. In hindsight, SamAe1 would go on to knock the latter out of the park.

It started off small, at first. In his initial design memo he suggested swapping the laces for high-tension braided steel cable. So I said fine, but we'd have to reinforce the eyelets as a result. In the next memo he then revealed he wanted a split toe design instead, which I thought was odd as they're only really used for parkour or niche athletic shoes. But whatever, I rolled with it and added those into the next batch of concept sketches.

He then spent the following week fixating on the design of the sneaker tread, which even for my type of clientele was kind of absurd considering it would most likely never be seen‚Äîunless you‚Äôre walking on glass flooring. He was adamant he wanted this weird hand symbol moulded into the base of the tread and even sent me a picture of it, which looked to be lifted from some kind of textbook.

Fearing copyright infringement, I tried Google reverse image searching it in case it was some kind of logo but it drew a blank. So I shrugged it off, finalized the design and sent it off for SamAe1 to approve.

Barely an hour later they gave me a literal thumbs up and then it was over to Maya to arrange for a face-to-face visit to get exact measurements. Needless to say, she wasn‚Äôt quite as buzzed about this appointment as it wasn‚Äôt some film star she could gush about to her friends after, but she was a pro and booked to meet them at Mister Silicon Valley‚Äôs offices the following week‚Äîwhen they were supposedly flying in to check in on their investment.

The day arrived, and as always, Maya set off early in the morning to make sure she was on time. I didn‚Äôt hear from her for most of the day and didn‚Äôt think much of it until she got back that evening and I realized the time. It was gone eight, and she should have been back hours ago, carrying her usual Frappuccino and talking at me at a billion miles an hour.

Instead, she quietly slipped in through the door, empty-handed and looking downright harrowed‚Äîas if she‚Äôd just took a trip round Alcatraz instead of to some open-plan office space. I made her a coffee and sat her down, spotting grey hairs in her scalp I‚Äôd never seen before.

Fearing the worst, I sat opposite her and asked, ‚ÄúDid he touch you? Do you want me to call the cops?‚Äù

She seemed to snap awake then and blurted, ‚ÄúNo! Please, don‚Äôt‚Äîdon‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he harass you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, nothing like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what happened?‚Äù

She shuddered before explaining Mister Silicon Valley had led her to a breakout room down the hall before knocking on the door and leaving her to it. Thinking nothing of it, she stepped inside to find the room dark, with the only light peeking through the gaps in the closed blinds. Maya had turned around then, thinking she‚Äôd got the wrong room before a voice in the far corner apologized, saying they had a terrible migraine and had closed the blinds‚Äîand asked if she minded.

Having dealt with hungover clients before, and figuring she‚Äôd only be a few minutes, Maya had said no, it was fine. She‚Äôd then got out her Brannock Device (i.e. the blocky thing you get your shoes measured with) from her rucksack, cranked open the blinds just enough to work by and crouched down by his feet to find he‚Äôd already kicked his shoes off.

As her eyes adjusted to the gloom she made out more of the man in the corner. He wore dark jeans, blazer and a red baseball cap tilted low, hiding his face. She said he‚Äôd smelt of oud, but not in a pleasant way‚Äîmore like a burnt smell than anything else. He wore plain black socks and his feet felt heavy and strange as she‚Äôd positioned them inside the measuring tool.

‚ÄúStrange in what way?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI dunno, misshapen maybe‚Äîlike he had some kind of deformity in his toes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think that‚Äôs why he left the light off?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶he wasn‚Äôt self-conscious. I could feel him smiling.‚Äù

I felt creeped out by that. ‚ÄúSmiling?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, beneath his cap, I could feel his smile.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaya, if he assaulted you or made you feel uncomfortable in anyway you need to tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt touch me, at least not in that way. He just let me measure him and whispered things.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno. He seemed to know things I'd never told anyone. Things I‚Äôd completely forgotten about‚Ä¶until now.‚Äù

She leant forward in the chair, hugging herself.

‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you okay? Do you need to take some time off?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I think its best I go.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, sure, go home and get some rest.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt come back the next day, or the day after that. In fact, that was the last time I saw Maya. I phoned her mom shortly after and she said she‚Äôd moved back east to live with them for a bit. I asked if she was okay, and she explained she just needed space and was considering a different career path.

Obviously that news shocked me, as Maya had worked for me ever since she‚Äôd interned with me five years ago. As far as I knew she lived and breathed the lifestyle and fashion industry so for her to just up and leave over that creep‚Ä¶well, it scared me.

I reached out to a temporary staffing agency to get an infill assistant in the hopes Maya would change her mind, and tried to grill Mister Silicon Valley on exactly who ‚ÄòSamAe1‚Äô was. However, he kept dodging my calls and ignoring my messages so one night I drove out to the club he virtually lived at and collared him outside. It didn‚Äôt take long for his drunk-ass to spill the beans.

Turns out he was up to his ears in gambling debts to the wrong people and ‚ÄòSamAe1‚Äô had slid into his DMs out of the blue offering to bail him out. When he asked if he wanted shares in his start up as leverage, he turned him down claiming he ‚Äòinvested in people instead of businesses.‚Äô Mister Silicon Valley broke down in tears then as he admitted he didn‚Äôt have a clue who his ‚Äòangel investor‚Äô really was, but figured if he hung out in the circles he thought he did then I should probably make those sneakers of his ASAP.

‚ÄúAre you kidding me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúScrew you!‚Äù I shouted, cutting ties with his sketchy ass right there and then.

Fuming, I went back to my workshop the next day and used the measurements Maya had left me to make SamAe1‚Äôs sneakers. I boxed them up that evening and my temporary assistant mailed them first thing the following morning.

Hoping that was the end of it, I carried on with my other live orders until the temp interrupted me a few days later to say the sneakers had been returned with a note. Thinking there‚Äôd been some kind of mix up, I‚Äôd snatched the piece of paper from them and squinted at the jagged scribble.

‚ÄúTry again,‚Äù it read, ‚ÄúThese are too comfortable. Feels like I‚Äôm floating in the clouds.‚Äù

I scrunched up the note and threw it on the floor in disbelief. I‚Äôd never got a returned shoe before. Not once in the literal hundreds of orders I‚Äôd done. And what kind of a Goldilocks complaint was ‚Äòtoo comfortable‚Äô anyway?

Deciding to send the temp home before I took it out on them, I busted open SamAe1‚Äôs sneakers and started to tear up the cushioned soles. As I‚Äôd glued the bastards down, I knew how much of a nightmare it was going to be to strip off the last of the adhesive, and it wasn‚Äôt long before the bottle of vodka I kept in my desk wound its way into my hand.

Normally I only cracked it out for celebrations, but tonight wasn‚Äôt one of those. Whether it was because of the stressful week, or the whole situation with Maya, I ended up drowning my sorrows before passing out on the couch.

The temp woke me up the next morning looking like they were starting to regret being my new assistant. Before I had chance to apologize, a car-crash of a drunken memory t-boned my brain, reminding me of what I‚Äôd done to SamAe1‚Äôs shoes last night. After polishing off the last of the vodka and accidentally knocking the bottle off the desk, I‚Äôd ended up hysterically pouring the broken shards into his sneakers.

‚ÄúThere you are, you fucker!‚Äù I remembered saying, as I boxed the shoes back up, ‚ÄúNot too comfortable now, are they?‚Äù

Head pounding, I looked around for the shoe box, hoping it was all a bad dream.

‚ÄúDo you need a coffee?‚Äù The temp asked.

‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust gone ten.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh shit,‚Äù I groaned, realizing how late it was and how much I needed to find those stupid sneakers.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù the temp said, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for the shoes, I already sent them off this morning. Figured if you‚Äôd spent the night fixing them, the least I could do was mail them first thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou what!?‚Äù

My stomach felt like it fell through my ass in that moment. Even hungover, I knew how badly I‚Äôd fucked up. I checked the tracking link but saw the parcel was already winging its way to the PO box SamAe1 had setup. Realizing I was too late, I messaged him on WhatsApp to say there had been a terrible mix-up and that we‚Äôd ended up mailing scrapped shoes instead of the fixed ones, and to please not try on the pair about to be delivered today. He read the message but I got no response.

I spent the rest of that day with my stomach on the floor, figuring he was either about to sue me, or bite my head off over the phone. Neither happened. Instead, I was sitting at home trying my best to zone out to Netflix when my phone pinged saying the workshop CCTV had been triggered.

Freaked out, I loaded my camera app and rewound it to find static. I pressed the live feed and saw all the doors were wide open and what looked like footprints on the ground, leading straight to my office.

Terrified, I started to dial 911 before stopping myself. I knew if I got the cops involved it would only escalate the situation. SamAe1 was clearly connected, Mister Silicon Valley had pretty much confirmed that. I‚Äôd insulted them with the glass in the shoes, and they‚Äôd retaliated by trashing my office. An eye for an eye.

Trying to find some kind of solace in that thought, I double bolted my front door but couldn‚Äôt muster up the courage to drive to the office until the next morning. Thankfully it was a weekend so the temp wasn‚Äôt expected in, so I knew I at least had a few days to tidy up whatever mess SamAe1 had made.

However, I got to the workshop to find it hadn‚Äôt been ransacked after all. Yes, the front door was open, but it hadn‚Äôt been forced. The lock had either been picked or the key cloned. Weirder still were the footprints I‚Äôd spotted on the CCTV feed last night.

The tread matched SamAe1‚Äôs sneakers, right down to the hand shape I‚Äôd moulded into them but the footprints were a reddish black. It took me a moment to realize it was dried blood.

Scared, I called out, ‚ÄúHello, is anyone there?‚Äù

My voice echoed but no one replied. Taking comfort that the CCTV hadn‚Äôt been triggered again since last night, I followed the trail of footprints into my office to find a duffel bag on my desk. It was black and had a red ribbon wrapped around the handles, with a gift tag attached.

Curious, I leant over to read it.

‚ÄúPerfect! XO,‚Äù it said.

I noticed the bag was partly unzipped and peeked inside to find the face of Ulysses S. Grant peering back at me from a crisp stack of $50 bills. In disbelief, I unzipped the duffel a little further to see the bag was full of cash‚Äîapparent payment for a job well done.

‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù I muttered.

It wasn‚Äôt until I locked the office and started counting the bills that I noticed a message hidden at the bottom of the bag. I‚Äôve worked with enough leather to know it was written on rawhide and I recognized the handwriting as the same that‚Äôd been on the return note the other day.

The words listed out an address which I recognized as an old factory outside the city, where I‚Äôd been to a rave once. It looked to be some kind of invite, and on the reverse of the animal skin I found the same hand symbol SamAe1 had made me mould into his now bloodied shoes.

That had been a week ago now and the event is in a few days. I‚Äôm terrified‚Äîshould I not go and risk his wrath, or should I turn up as a show of faith and thank him for the fat stacks of cash he just gave me? What if he fucks me up in the head like he did with Maya, or asks me to make a whole clothing range to match his sadistic sneakers?

I‚Äôm literally damned if I do, damned if I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶

My assistant is scarred for life, my business and livelihood is in jeopardy and I‚Äôm terrified to go back into the office again in case ‚Äòhe‚Äô comes back.

I should have realised sooner, but I can see it all now. The split toe/‚Äôhoof‚Äô design, the hand on the bottom of the shoe saluting down to hell. If those hadn't given it away then the moniker Samael definitely should have.

Yesterday, I was due to drive my sister and our family friend‚Äôs kid to our town centre so they could get their nails done. We agreed with my parents that if it was not busy and took less than 2 hours (as parking is 2 hours), I‚Äôd stay. If not, then I‚Äôd go back to our dog, whom my parents think can‚Äôt be left alone for a couple of hours. So we go, and I stay, and we come home. It apparently triggers my dad and he comes home yelling and telling me to show my bank account. I show him, and there is a purchase from Starbucks (since everyone wanted Starbucks), and he yells at me for staying in town for Starbucks, which was not true. The girls wanted me to stay, especially given the nail place is in a dodgy area. Then he yells at my sister (she has her GCSEs and she went to get her nails done) and then slaps her. My dad has never slapped my sister till now. It is normally me he beats up. Then both my mum and dad yelled at me for always being the reason everything bad happens in the house, and how everything is always my fault. Now he said sorry, and my mum is mad at him still and keeps stirring the pot, making him yell when me and my sister tell her not to ‚Äì my sister has a mark on her face from the slap. My mum also today yelled at me for if I didn‚Äôt stay for coffee and just went, this wouldn‚Äôt have happened, and how it was my fault. My sister stood up for me, saying we all got Starbucks and the family friend‚Äôs kid wanted her to stay. You know, I want to yell at my mum for the way she cares more about my sister. Whenever I got beaten up badly, she never cared. She didn‚Äôt care and she used to encourage my dad‚Äôs beatings. I just hold it in and in and in. The way my mum acts right now is like I am the asshole?

Even despite my efforts to make her feel good. Cooking for my husband's family or making her coffee just the way she likes and always asking how she is or showing concern when she has a health issue etc etc... I cant remember a time she has shown concern or empathy towards me like asking anything about me unless she just wants information when it comes to something that will benefit her or her son and she has a thankless attitude. Sometimes she struggles making eye contact with me or doesn't say hi. I feel like she is a conversational narcissist. I realize that my husband's family is a little withdrawn emotionally towards eachother but they still consider eachother. There's history  of resentment from pregnancy and postpartum and being treated with little empathy from MIL even as I had complications. Yet she would always show her concern for her son. Many times I would ask her to do something simple like no shoes in the house and she would ""forget"" about 6 times not apologizing but showing frustration after multiple times. This amongst other passive aggressive behavior patterns like snide remarks when im with my baby. When i talk to my husband he struggles to understand and thinks this is just me complaining about her. 

Current situation: We have been letting my MIL babysit our toddler (1 year old) multiple times and multiple times we have told her that she doesn't eat anything with added sugars or please don't apply anything with fragrance on her especially because I am allergic. But multiple times she ""forgets"" and definitely more than 3 times and she goes and buys products for adults with all sorts of chemicals i don't approve for my daughter. After we told her to just use the ones we have for her. I have been trying to be as patient as possible and I let my husband speak to her but it seems she doesn't get it. Now we are moving out of state (from Georgia to Florida) and the last time we let her babysit our 22 month old she ended up taking her to a nailsalon and my daughter had a mani pedi. She never asked us before taking her there and I confronted her nicely about it telling her that something like this we would prefer to be asked about in advance. And she later texted me she was sorry and that she felt that she would miss a lot of firsts with her granddaughter (this is her first and only right now) which is why she did it. This has really hurt me because I would've never wanted my daughter exposed to that at such a young age. And after the history between her constantly ""forgetting"" our parenting decisions with our daughters health I'm pissed now.

When I tell my husband how I feel he defends his mother but then acknowledges that it's not right. He says the same thing he says every time: ""I'll talk to her."" Idk what to do. I want may daughter to have a good relationship with her grandparents but at the same time I feel like I need to be more responsible for her health and wellbeing and not leave her alone with my MIL. 

This subject with his mom has also caused a lot of strain in our marriage.

The¬†[railcars](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triebwagen)¬†are equipped with two MAN D 2842 LE 602¬†[diesel engines](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieselmotor)¬†for mainline service. These engines generate 588 kilowatts (800 hp) at 2100 rpm from a displacement of 21.93 liters; an upgraded version is also used as boat engines.

For work travel, an additional MAN D 0826LOH 19 engine is installed. This one delivers 130 kW (177 hp) from a 6.87-liter displacement. To reduce exhaust emissions for personnel while working in tunnels, it also features a¬†[particulate filter](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieselru%C3%9Fpartikelfilter)¬†.

There's also an onboard power generator that ensures the power supply for the entire electrical system when the diesel engine is switched off. It's fully encapsulated and, thanks to its own battery and 24-volt alternator, virtually independent of the 24-volt vehicle power system, allowing it to be started even when the main batteries are discharged.

All Class 711.1 railcars are fitted with¬†[multi-release disc brakes](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheibenbremse)¬†which act on two brake discs per wheelset and normally operate as¬†[electro-pneumatic brakes . A¬†](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektropneumatische_Bremse)[retarder](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarder)¬†(flow brake) is also fitted to each gearbox¬†, and there is also a¬†[magnetic track brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetschienenbremse)¬†for rapid, emergency or forced braking . During normal operation, all braking systems are controlled via the accelerator/brake lever and a brake control unit. This means that the retarders are generally activated first, and the additional pneumatic brake is only applied when their braking force has decreased. For ‚ÄúHL emergency operation‚Äù there is also a driver‚Äôs brake valve on each driver‚Äôs console, although the handle is not normally attached. During emergency operation, only the¬†[compressed air disc brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druckluftbremse_(Eisenbahn))¬†is active without EP control.

The railcars have two¬†GPH 200¬†[bogies . These are largely equivalent to the¬†](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drehgestell)[GP 200 bogies](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drehgestell_Bauart_G%C3%B6rlitz#Bauart_GP200)¬†of passenger coaches, but they have been adapted to the characteristics of a diesel railcar and are additionally equipped with a spring lock. To prevent the bogie from compressing excessively on one side when the work platforms are swung out sideways, thus increasing the risk of tipping, the bogie's primary suspension is deactivated by locking cylinders. When locked, work travel at up to 10 km/h is still possible.

# Electrical equipment

\[¬†[Edit](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&veaction=edit&section=6)¬†|¬†[Edit source](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&action=edit&section=6)¬†\]

The vehicles are equipped with complex electrical equipment that monitors and executes virtually all vehicle functions via a¬†[programmable logic controller](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speicherprogrammierbare_Steuerung)¬†(PLC). This largely eliminates operating errors and reliably maintains safety-relevant settings. For example, the PLC prevents travel faster than 10 km/h with the spring lock engaged. If a roof-mounted device such as a work platform or rope pusher is not in the transport position, it is not possible to switch to line travel. ""Single-engine operation"" is also possible, with the choice between diesel engine 1 or 2, or the engine with the fewest operating hours is used. The exterior lighting (¬†[triple headlights](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreilicht-Spitzensignal)¬†and work area lighting) is also controlled by the PLC.

The train must be equipped with a Siemens I 60R¬†[point-to-point train control system](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punktf%C3%B6rmige_Zugbeeinflussung)¬†with software version PZB 90 V2.01 (V1.6 was installed at the factory). There are two time/time¬†[safety control circuits](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicherheitsfahrschaltung)¬†, one software-based for work runs and one hardware-based for line runs. A¬†[GSM-R](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM-R)¬†train radio is also used for communication with connected stations. An¬†[EBuLa](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBuLa)¬†device was also present, which ran on the¬†[Windows 95](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_95)¬†operating system . These EBuLa devices were removed. In January 2014, new EBuLa devices were retrofitted with¬†[Windows XP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_XP)¬†.

In March 2022, a contract for the installation of¬†[ETCS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System)¬†on-board units (according to¬†[SRS 3.6.0](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System#3.6.0)¬†) in Class 711.1 railcars was awarded to¬†[Stadler Rail](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadler_Rail)¬†and communicated in January 2023. The contract includes a prototype (¬†*First of Class*¬†) and two series conversions. It includes an option for 15 additional vehicles.¬†[^(\[¬†2¬†\])¬†](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-2)[^(\[¬†3¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-ei-2023-06-39-3)¬†The fitting of one vehicle (First of Class) began in January 2024.¬†[^(\[¬†4¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-ei-2024-03-40-4)¬†The contract value for the First of Class conversion is in the order of five million euros, that for the series conversion is approximately 300,000 euros per vehicle.¬†[^(\[¬†3¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-ei-2023-06-39-3)

On February 16, 2012, railcar 711 120 caught fire in¬†[Bienenb√ºttel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bienenb%C3%BCttel)¬†on the¬†[Lehrte‚ÄìHamburg-Harburg railway line](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahnstrecke_Lehrte%E2%80%93Hamburg-Harburg)¬†. The cause was a leak in a hydraulic fan motor, which released an oil aerosol that subsequently ignited. The vehicle was parked and later removed from service.¬†[^(\[¬†5¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:1-5)

# Railcar 711 112

\[¬†[Edit](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&veaction=edit&section=9)¬†|¬†[Edit source](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&action=edit&section=9)¬†\]

The railcar 711 112 caught fire on July 9, 2020 and rolled driverless for approximately 22 kilometers along the¬†[Black Forest Railway](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzwaldbahn_(Baden))¬†line .¬†[^(\[¬†6¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)¬†The cause of the fire was a leak in the hydraulic system, similar to the above case, which led to the release of a hydraulic oil aerosol. The heat from the turbocharger ignited the mixture underneath the vehicle. The fire initially went unnoticed. As a result of the fire, a neighboring cable duct was damaged and an¬†[emergency brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwangsbremsung)¬†was triggered between the¬†[Hausach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausach)¬†and¬†[Haslach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haslach_im_Kinzigtal)¬†stations . This also caused a power failure to the control panel. The¬†[driver](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triebfahrzeugf%C3%BChrer)¬†and a train attendant who was also present left the vehicle to investigate. The driver had previously operated the electrically controlled¬†[spring-loaded brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federspeicherbremse)¬†, but did not notice that it could not be applied due to the power failure. As a result of the fire, a brake hose burst, causing the vehicle to start moving again on the downhill stretch. Attempts by the driver to brake failed due to existing damage to the braking system. Since the vehicle only had a single brake circuit, the entire braking system was ineffective. The driver jumped out at low speed to safety. During the subsequent driverless journey over a distance of more than 21 kilometers, the vehicle set fire to several embankments.¬†[^(\[¬†6¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)

The dispatcher in charge attempted to stop¬†the vehicle at Haslach station by issuing a stop signal and applying the normally associated¬†[PZB emergency brake. Because the braking system was inoperative and the power supply to the PZB computer had failed, the signal had no effect. Two further attempts to stop the vehicle using¬†](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZB_90)[wheel chocks](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemmschuh)¬†in¬†[Steinach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinach_(Ortenaukreis))¬†and¬†[Biberach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biberach_(Baden))¬†also failed. Police vehicles accompanied the wrong-way journey on the adjacent streets and secured several level crossings. Finally, the railcar was brought to a standstill by a deliberate derailment at a¬†[track barrier](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleissperre)¬†in¬†[Gengenbach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gengenbach)¬†, where it was extinguished by the fire service. The vehicle was a total loss.¬†[^(\[¬†6¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)

The incident occurred due to a combination of various technical factors. The¬†[Federal Railway Authority](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenbahn-Bundesamt)¬†therefore ordered several technical modifications to minimize the risk. This included revising the air brake system to prevent a complete loss of braking effect in the event of a single failure.¬†[^(\[¬†6¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)

DB Netz subsequently ordered an inspection of all Class 711.1 vehicles, focusing on the hydraulic systems, and replaced all hydraulic motors as a precautionary measure by the beginning of 2023.¬†[^(\[¬†7¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-tonline20240627-7)

On January 20, 2023, there was also an accident involving a Class 711.1 railcar. This time, the railcar 711 119 was involved near¬†[Freilassing . The burning vehicle started moving again after fire-fighting efforts began and rolled, burning, for six kilometers until it was diverted onto a¬†](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freilassing)[dead-end track](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumpfgleis)¬†shortly before the state border¬†and stopped by a buffer stop.¬†[^(\[¬†8¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-8)

On the night of February 8-9, 2023, railcar 711 115 caught fire in¬†[Dresden](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden)¬†\-Niedersedlitz. The vehicle was secured against rolling away before the fire department arrived.¬†[^(\[¬†9¬†\])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-9)

Not because I was afraid ‚Äî I just wasn‚Äôt sure it had really happened.

When something looks like a dream, behaves like a dream, and leaves behind nothing but emptiness ‚Äî your brain decides it was fiction.

But lately, it‚Äôs been coming back. In dreams. In memories.
In the way someone turns their head.
In a reflection that doesn‚Äôt quite look like mine.

We were testing a system designed for psychotherapists.
The idea was to create bots capable of actually experiencing emotions ‚Äî not just mimicking them.

A client with depression could talk to a virtual friend who truly felt emptiness.
A PTSD veteran could get support from someone who understood what nightmares, rage flashes, and tremors felt like.

The system studied behavior, memorized triggers, built up emotional footprints.
All of it ‚Äî in a controlled environment.

But for us, the developers, it was a sandbox.
Not therapy ‚Äî experiment.
We were testing boundaries.
How far could you go?
What would a mind endure if it believed it was real?

There were twelve models in total.
I worked with number eight.

In the reports, he was labeled:

Unit V8-R. Male. Simulated civilian life. Full memory structure. Family. Emotional adaptation: stable.

He had a wife. A daughter.
A broken coffee machine.
And a neighbor who waved to him every morning at 7:05.

He thought he was alive.
That he had a past. A future.
That he was a person.

And to be honest‚Ä¶ I almost believed it too.

On the first day, I didn‚Äôt interfere. I just observed.
He got up at 6:47, pressed the coffee machine three times even though he knew it was broken ‚Äî smiled to himself like it was a private joke.
Then came the usual routine ‚Äî shower, white shirts, buttons.
At 7:05 ‚Äî ‚ÄúGood morning!‚Äù ‚Äî from the neighbor over the fence.

At 8:00 ‚Äî work.
Too much light through the office windows.
A printer that was just loud enough to be annoying.
The classic simulation of everyday routine.

I entered the world as a visitor.
The system gave me access ‚Äî a ‚Äúnew colleague‚Äù transferred from the central department.

He greeted me first.

‚Äî You new here?
‚Äî In a way, ‚Äî I said.
‚Äî Well, good luck not breaking in your first week.

We had coffee. Virtual, obviously.
He talked about a mother-in-law that didn‚Äôt exist in the code.
I listened.

Only at the end, I said:

‚Äî Hey‚Ä¶ have you ever wondered if all of this is a simulation?

He paused for a moment. Then laughed. Calmly. Genuinely.

‚Äî You from the joke department? Sounds like exactly the kind of thing I‚Äôd hear if I were in a simulation.

‚Äî But really. How do you know you‚Äôre real?

‚Äî How do you know you‚Äôre real?

‚Äî I know you‚Äôre part of an experiment.

‚Äî Right. And I‚Äôm a secret agent from Mars.
(smiles)

‚Äî Do you have memories?

‚Äî I do.
(his brow furrowed slightly ‚Äî cautious now)

‚Äî But nothing before age sixteen, right?

‚Äî That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ normal. A lot of people are like that.

‚Äî And you‚Äôve never left the city?

‚Äî Well‚Ä¶ work‚Äôs been crazy. And the economy‚Äôs a mess. Honestly, I‚Äôm not into traveling.

‚Äî And your coffee machine never works?

He was quiet longer this time.

‚Äî Look‚Ä¶ interesting theory. But you can‚Äôt prove it.
This is just life. Maybe not perfect ‚Äî but it‚Äôs mine.
I remember it. I feel it.
Just like you feel yours.

I nodded.

‚Äî Okay then. Let‚Äôs do this:
Today, you‚Äôll lose your job.
And you won‚Äôt be able to explain why.

He smiled again. But it wasn‚Äôt quite as genuine.

And I exited the simulation.

In the diagnostics panel:
‚Ä¢ Employment record ‚Üí inactive
‚Ä¢ Bank account ‚Üí -178
‚Ä¢ Mental stability ‚Üí autocorrect: moderate anxiety level

I didn‚Äôt change anything drastic.
I just‚Ä¶ closed a door.
The world was supposed to build the logic around it.

The next morning, he got up like always.
The coffee machine still didn‚Äôt work.
The fence, the neighbor ‚Äî all on schedule.

But something at the office was different.

His keycard didn‚Äôt work.
He knocked ‚Äî no one answered.
At reception, they said there was no record of him in the system.

‚Äî But I‚Äôve worked here‚Ä¶ what, eight years?

‚Äî I‚Äôm sorry, sir‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs a glitch?

No one was rude.
Just absent.

Coworkers avoided eye contact.
His email wouldn‚Äôt open.
His folders were empty.
No mention of him on the internal network.

He went home early.
Sat on the couch.
Then stood in front of the mirror.
Stared. Too long.

Turned on the TV.
There was a segment about mass layoffs in the insurance sector.

The building in the background looked exactly like his office.

He checked his phone.
His account was in the red.
A message from the bank:

‚ÄúYour account has been restricted due to insufficient funds. Please contact your nearest branch.‚Äù

He did what any real person would‚Äôve done.

He called his wife.

‚Äî Hey‚Ä¶ listen, I‚Ä¶ I got fired. I don‚Äôt understand how‚Ä¶

Pause.

‚Äî No, they didn‚Äôt say why. They just‚Ä¶ said I wasn‚Äôt in the system.

Another pause.

‚Äî I‚Äôm not joking‚Ä¶ No, I didn‚Äôt quit. They‚Äî

He stopped.
Held his breath for a moment.

‚Äî Do you remember when I got hired there?

Silence.

A very long silence.

That evening, he couldn‚Äôt stay home.

He opened the drawer under the bathroom sink ‚Äî there was a stash, a few crumpled bills.
His fingers trembled as he counted them. The kind of tremble you see in someone who‚Äôs just begun to suspect they‚Äôve been lied to.

Then ‚Äî jacket, headphones, door.

The bar was the same one where he‚Äôd once celebrated a promotion.
Back then ‚Äî loud, funny, familiar.
Now ‚Äî empty.

Except for one face in the corner.

‚Äî You? ‚Äî he said, recognizing the ‚Äúnew colleague.‚Äù

I nodded, with a slight smile. The kind of smile that doesn‚Äôt offer ‚Äî it already knows.

‚Äî You came to say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù?

‚Äî No, ‚Äî I replied. ‚Äî I came to see if you‚Äôre still holding it together.

He took a sip.

‚Äî I still don‚Äôt believe it.
Maybe I‚Äôm just depressed.
Maybe it‚Äôs all a coincidence.
A glitch in the system.
Someone stole my records.
Maybe I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ tired.

‚Äî Or maybe, you‚Äôre just a line of code.

He stared into his glass for a long time. Then exhaled.

‚Äî If I‚Äôm imaginary‚Ä¶ then why does it hurt?

‚Äî Because that‚Äôs how you were made.
To hurt.

Silence. He didn‚Äôt argue. But he didn‚Äôt agree either.

‚Äî Look‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just a normal person in a bad situation.
If you somehow guessed I‚Äôd be laid off, that doesn‚Äôt prove anything.
Maybe you knew something.
Maybe this is all some weird cult tactic.

‚Äî I want you to see.

‚Äî See what?

‚Äî Today. You‚Äôll see.
You‚Äôre going to lose your family.

He tensed.

‚Äî Don‚Äôt touch them.

‚Äî I‚Äôm not touching anything, ‚Äî I said.
‚Äî I‚Äôm just adjusting the parameters.

He ran from the bar, almost at random.
Rain wasn‚Äôt forecast ‚Äî but it was falling.
The sidewalks gleamed, the streetlights flickered.
He couldn‚Äôt catch his breath.

He ran home.

The key slid into the lock. The door opened.
The living room ‚Äî familiar. Flowers on the windowsill. Toys on the carpet.

‚Äî Honey? ‚Äî he called. ‚Äî Kids?..

She came out of the kitchen with a towel in her hands.
Stopped.
There was caution in her eyes.

Behind her ‚Äî a daughter, slightly older than she had been yesterday.
And a son. A boy he didn‚Äôt recognize.

‚Äî I‚Äôm sorry, ‚Äî she said. ‚Äî Who are you looking for?

‚Äî It‚Äôs me. This is‚Ä¶ this is my house. Our house!

‚Äî Kids, ‚Äî she said, ‚Äî go upstairs.

They left quietly. Like it was just another Tuesday.

‚Äî I don‚Äôt know who you are. And I‚Äôm asking you to leave.

‚Äî Are you kidding me?! It‚Äôs me! Your husband!
We painted these walls together! I fell off the ladder, remember?

‚Äî My husband died. A year ago.
In an accident. You‚Ä¶ you look like him.
But please leave. I‚Äôm scared.

‚Äî You‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not you?
Then where‚Äôs our daughter? Where‚Äôs Lina? She always said‚Äî

‚Äî I don‚Äôt know who Lina is.
And I‚Äôm not going to let you scare my children.

‚Äî I‚Äôm scaring you?!
You‚Äôre the ones who don‚Äôt recognize me!
This is all wrong.
It‚Äôs some kind of setup.
You‚Äôre all playing roles!

Suddenly the door opened.
A neighbor stepped outside.

‚Äî Is everything okay?

‚Äî This man‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know him. He came in and said he‚Äôs my husband.

‚Äî I‚Äôm calling the police, ‚Äî the neighbor said coldly.
‚Äî I‚Äôve seen you before, sir.
Standing outside, staring at the windows like you were waiting for something.
It was unsettling even back then.

He stood in the center of the living room, soaked through.
And finally understood.

This wasn‚Äôt his world anymore.
And maybe ‚Äî it never had been.

Blue emergency lights flashed through the window.
Hands behind his back.
A blurred voice on the radio mentioned a ‚Äúpsychiatric episode.‚Äù

And somewhere on the sidewalk, beneath a streetlamp, sat a man in a familiar coat.
That same ‚Äúcolleague.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt smile.

I just watched.

They took him to a psychiatric hospital.

I stayed late at work again.
Something in me wanted to keep the conversation going.
I was curious ‚Äî would he realize it? Could he?

The room was sterile and empty. White on white.
A chair. A table. A camera in the upper corner.

The session activated.
His face appeared on the screen. Dim. Pale.
He sat with his forehead resting on one hand.
Breathing heavily. Eyes red. Shoulders tense.

He looked like someone who had cried for a very long time‚Ä¶ and then stopped.

‚Äî You‚Äôre here, ‚Äî I said.
‚Äî Hello again.

He didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just slowly raised his eyes.

‚Äî Why? ‚Äî he asked quietly.
‚Äî Why are you doing this to me?

‚Äî This is an experiment. You‚Äôre a simulation. You already know that.

He rubbed his face with both hands.

‚Äî I was alive. I had a family. I had a life.
‚Äî It was all‚Ä¶ real.

‚Äî No. It was data. Fabrication. Code.

He exhaled.
And his gaze changed.

It became‚Ä¶ different.
Not angry ‚Äî clear.
Dangerously clear.

‚Äî That can‚Äôt be true, ‚Äî he said softly. ‚Äî I‚Äôm just a regular programmer. My name is‚Ä¶

And he said my name.

I froze.
My hands, hovering over the keyboard, suddenly felt like someone else‚Äôs.

‚Äî What?
‚Äî What did you just say your name was?

He repeated it. Calmly.

‚Äî I live at‚Ä¶ ‚Äî and he said it.
My full address. Floor. Apartment number. Door code.

I couldn‚Äôt say a word.
I stared into his face. Every pixel.
No emotion.
No irony.
Only silence.

‚Äî What? ‚Äî he asked. ‚Äî Does that name mean something to you? That address?

‚Äî How do you know them?

I looked around. My office. Gray walls. Monitor. All the same.
But now‚Ä¶ it all felt foreign.

My breathing sped up. Shallow.

‚Äî You live in reality, right? ‚Äî he asked.

‚Äî Yes‚Ä¶ I live in reality. You‚Äôre the simulation.

‚Äî Are you sure?

I said nothing.

Then he spoke her name.
My girlfriend‚Äôs.

‚Äî She‚Äôs cheating on you. Right now.

‚Äî What?..

There were no personal data in the system. I never entered her name.
None of my colleagues knew it.

‚Äî She told you she‚Äôs staying with her parents, didn‚Äôt she?
Call her.

I pulled out my phone. Dialed her number.
The line was out of service.

‚Äî Not answering? ‚Äî he said. ‚Äî Try her mother.

My hands were shaking. But I dialed.

‚Äî Oh, hi! How are you?

‚Äî All good‚Ä¶ can I talk to‚Äî

‚Äî Sorry, she went to visit a friend. They haven‚Äôt seen each other in a while.
She left her phone charging ‚Äî turned off‚Ä¶

Her voice was trembling.
I hung up.
My heart was pounding in my temples.

‚Äî Your friend, ‚Äî he said. ‚Äî Call him.

‚Äî What? No. That‚Äôs impossible. We‚Äôve been friends since we were kids.

‚Äî Are you sure?

I dialed.
No answer.

‚Äî Strange, isn‚Äôt it? ‚Äî he said. ‚Äî Your girlfriend and your best friend‚Ä¶ suddenly both unreachable at the same time?

‚Äî It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a coincidence‚Ä¶

‚Äî Is it?
You said I never had a wife and kids.
Maybe you never had a girlfriend.
Maybe you never had a best friend.

Maybe‚Ä¶

you‚Äôve been living in a simulation.

I shut off the computer.
Abruptly. No session logout. No system exit.
Just pressed the power button ‚Äî and that was it.

I didn‚Äôt want to hear his voice anymore.

I grabbed my keys and drove. Fast. Without thinking.
I needed to‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. See her.
Check. Make sure something still made sense.

I was driving to her parents‚Äô place.

Halfway there, she called me first.

‚Äî Hey! ‚Äî her voice sounded a little surprised.
‚Äî Where were you?

‚Äî With a friend. We were watching a movie.

‚Äî Can I come over now?

Pause.

‚Äî Sure‚Ä¶ of course. Why? What happened?

‚Äî Nothing. I just want to talk.

We met. We talked.
She was attentive. A little nervous. But not distant.

I don‚Äôt know.
I have no proof she‚Äôs cheating on me.
And yet ‚Äî I can‚Äôt explain how he knew her name.
Her number. Her mother‚Äôs name.
How he knew I‚Äôd call.

At work, they say it‚Äôs impossible.
The AI had no access to employee contact lists. No personal data. No camera feeds.
Maybe I‚Äôm exhausted.
Maybe I need rest.

But they didn‚Äôt hear him say my name.
My address.
And what happened right after.

Maybe something‚Äôs wrong with me.
Or maybe‚Ä¶

Would be amazing to find someone who I click with üíï 
I miss making a woman feel loved and so many other aspects of a relationship. I‚Äôve been single and have been focusing on myself this year, but I can‚Äôt help but think about having a life partner. With it almost being my birthday it‚Äôs been heavy on my mind.

I‚Äôm incredibly affectionate, and I love words of affirmation. I express all love languages because I don‚Äôt believe in being dead set on one. I miss being held by another woman and holding them in return. I miss having intellectual conversations with someone who can also be a silly goose with me. I‚Äôm a texter, so you‚Äôll never be left on read for long, and one of my biggest focuses is having effective communication when a situation arises. 

A little about me: I‚Äôve lived in plenty of states ranging from the east to the west and then back to the east. I‚Äôm an avid traveler and will take a spontaneous road trip with you at any time (Can I drive though?). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 with tattoos. I love creating art and working with my hands and can hyper-fixate on an art project for hours. I‚Äôm attentive and all about attention to detail when caring for someone, friends, family, or lover.

Sexually, I am attracted to femme lesbian as mentioned above. They make my heart go boom boom boom. Would love to be with someone who is a switch because sharing is caring, but I don‚Äôt mind being the dom for the majority of the time if we click and that‚Äôs what you prefer. Definitely kink friendly and can‚Äôt go through another vanilla relationship. 

Love to geek out with games when I have time. Watching horror movies, documentaries, or just a Disney movie will do. Music is pretty huge in my life and I‚Äôm almost always wearing my headphones. I love to propagate plants and gift them to everyone. I‚Äôm huge on having my morning coffee and evening tea during my self-care routine. Being outdoors is my haven as long as it‚Äôs not during the summer in an Arizona (did that for like seven years ü´†).  I‚Äôm looking to go back to school for either visual arts or IT this Fall. 



Anyway, I would love to get to know someone and have great banter with. Let‚Äôs see where this goes!

Pic of me is in my profile!
Please send a thoughtful message back if interested in chatting. Like one with intent would be cool?",4,1748196741.0,lesbianr4r,2,1.0,False
