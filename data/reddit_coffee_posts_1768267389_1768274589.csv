Hi everyone!

I’m a 30F from Vancouver, Canada heading to Puerto Vallarta for the first time and would love some  insight. I’ll be staying in the 5 de Diciembre area and traveling solo January 30-Feb 6

I’m looking for:
	•	Cafés (good coffee, chill vibes, laptop-friendly or social)
	•	Restaurants (local spots, must-tries, not super touristy but open to all)
	•	Bars / nightclubs where it’s easy to meet people (bonus if they’re friendly to solo travellers)

I’m also curious about safety at night. I’m cautious and street-smart, but realistically I’d be walking back from Zona Romántica to 5 de Diciembre, which is about a 25-minute walk. Is that generally considered okay at night, or would Uber/taxis be the better move after a certain hour?

As for activities:
	•	I already have two walking tours booked (one sightseeing, one food tour)
	•	Any must-do experiences beyond that? Beaches, day trips, beach clubs? 

Appreciate any recommendations or advice—especially from locals or fellow solo female travellers. Thanks in advance! 🌴✨

1qbgc7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qbgc7i/25f_25m_i_feel_like_having_kids_has_made_me/,"(25f, 25m) I feel like having kids has made me question if my husband is right for me ?","We have 2 kids (2 under 2) and despite what the title says, he’s an amazing father! I’m actually very pleasantly surprised with how well he’s stepped into fatherhood, our kids are very lucky! But this time period of our life is kind of opening my eyes and I’m starting to question if I made the right choice in a partner.. there’s several defining moments in our relationship that I feel like have stuck with me and I realized how much resentment I’m starting to have towards him. 

- on my very first Mother’s Day he stayed up until the early morning playing games, slept in until nearly noon while I woke up with our baby (5 months old at the time) and treated myself to coffee since I wanted to make the day feel special. He had no plans so we last minute decided to take our baby to the zoo, afterwards I got upset because he didn’t do anything for my first Mother’s Day and he ended up making me feel bad for it. 
- the night we got home with our second baby he got high and left me to do everything myself (he gets tested for work but since he was on paternity leave he felt like it was one of his few chances to smoke again)
- after our second baby I ended up getting really bad postpartum depression. His friend was planning to visit us and when he did they went out every day and night for multiple days, didn’t even invite me out to lunch or anything, and it was my first time being completely alone with our newborn and toddler while going through a real mental crisis. He felt as if I was trying to ruin his friends trip. (and we have no family or friend support since we had just moved to this state a few months prior so I really was all alone)

There’s a few other instances like this that contribute to the resentment but these specifically hurt me badly. I feel like times of difficulty and hardship should be what makes a relationship stronger but it really feels the complete opposite. 
We’ve had a really hard time communicating our whole relationship, he really just can’t seem to talk through emotions and it feels like we’ve never made progress despite our efforts. Every serious talk usually ends up with him saying that’s just not the kind of guy he is, and that what im asking for is not real and that no guy is going to be “as emotional as i want him to be” and that im “just mad because he’s not acting exactly how i want him to act.” And ALWAYS the next morning he smiles and sweeps it under the rug and pretends it never happened, we never have any sort of conflict resolution. 

Now I know he sounds pretty terrible but he really is a great guy, but I feel like when I need him most he is never there, and isn’t that what a relationship is all about? 95% of the time we’re best friends and have a great relationship, but I’m starting to wonder if the other 5% is enough to make me walk away. I just feel like I deserve a partner that’s emotionally available and SHOWS me he loves me rather than just tells me. I know we’re both still young but we’ve been together for 6 years and it doesn’t seem like he’s open to growth in this part of our relationship and I’m not sure if I’m willing to spend the rest of my life in a relationship like this when I know there is men out there that could give me the connection that I need. 

The thought of splitting up now that we have children genuinely destroys me, I never wanted that for our children but I’m also still living life for the first time too. I’m feeling pretty conflicted, I love him whole heartedly but I don’t want to look back in 10 years and know I could have done better. I can just feel my resentment towards him growing… do I keep working towards our future and hope is just a rocky time period or do men like this never really change?

I started at the high end of normal BMI and definitely high body fat percentage. Was advised by my Korean endocrinologist to try and drop 26! pounds and given no nutrition advice. I had high cholesterol (not high enough for meds yet) I have two parents on high cholesterol meds and I am in the highest risk category for heart disease. My mom is diabetes type 2, and my dad is prediabetic. So just want to let you know I am affected by my genetics certainly. 
In Korea you see the doctor for about 3 minutes if lucky so I had not much to go on. The Korean translator was pretty nice she said because I am a foreigner my body was different so losing 15 pound might be okay. (Still seems like a lot to me because I had a normal BMI…)
All my life i needed to eat frequently and in the past if I did a short fast I would faint. Lately I was tired and hungry all the time. 

What I did: 2.5 weeks of keto. I felt horrible most of this time. My husband joined me. We tried for less than 15 carbs a day. 

Then I transitioned to low carb less than 40 carbs a day. Started intermittent fasting. Dirty fast 16:8 I would have my coffee either milk. Eat only lunch and dinner no snacks. Suddenly after I cut carbs I could fast and hunger no longer made me feel crazy! It was amazing

3 months in switched to low-moderate carb. Most days sub 60 never went over 100. Never broke my fast either a high carb meal. Often did a very low carb meal for lunch, more carb at night. Great mental clarity, energy, more productive at work.

5 months in: holidays. I had some high carb days. Always felt bad afterwards limited to once a week, only one meal. Felt bad about eating more meat to hit macros, started switching to vegetarian low carb for lunches most days. For example a roasted vegetable salad with a fried egg, or burrito salad with some beans guacamole quest chips.

Today? LDL is down 40 points. I am no longer considered prediabetic. My endo said I did great and said I don’t need follow up’s. I will keeping eating healthy. If that’s all it takes to keep from getting diabetes, that’s an easy choice. I lost only 8 pounds. I did not focus on calories at all. Just eating healthy. I barely exercised just light yoga and some walks. 

What’s next? I’ll try to exercise more. I focused on sustainable habit change and weight loss and it worked for me. I hope someone else finds this helpful. Thanks again to this sub for helping me. 🙏",1,1768274175.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False

I had a second round interview today. It was an hour interview and originally, I was supposed to meet with the VP from 1-1:30PM then with 2 directors from 1:30-2PM. I got an email this morning saying the VP is sick and won’t be able to interview and the two directors would be separate - one at 1-1:30 then the other at 1:30-2PM. 

I joined the call at 1PM and no one was there. I waited until about 1:35PM and was caught off guard when both of them joined. I mentioned I was confused about what happened and they said they read the times wrong and apologized. 

Since they already joined the call a little late, the interview went a little past 2PM but one of them even left the meeting early because she said she had to jump to another meeting. I’m a little disappointed and annoyed because they barely asked any questions (maybe 3?). 

I sent an email to the recruiter and mentioned how both of them joined the call at the 1:30 time slot but I enjoyed my conversation with them and if any additional interview rescheduling is needed, please let me know and I’m happy to share availability.

1qbg8hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qbg8hn/how_to_disengage_peacefully_from_friend_who/,How to disengage peacefully from friend who doesn’t respect plans or follow through?,"I’m looking for an outside perspective and would really appreciate kind responses. Please bear with the long question!

Over the course of about 5 months of piano lessons, my piano teacher and I (we are the same age) developed good chemistry and became friendly. Since I’m in town for a short time, **she suggested** we meet up for coffee. We agreed on a date. I was excited to meet her in person. Since I don’t know the city very well (only been here couple of times, whereas she has lived here her whole life), I asked her to suggest the venue. But I still searched for some nice cafes close by and sent her suggestions. She didn’t confirm the venue or time until the night before. I waited till 9pm the night before and texted her to confirm if we are still meeting the next day. She replied asking if we can postpone because she was tired and asked if we can meet the day after.

Normally I would have been completely okay moving the date, but I was irritated because she didn’t even bother to text me until AFTER I checked in with her. I didn’t handle it well. I said fine but said I won’t be able to meet the day after. I should have just said that but I didn’t want to be rude so I gave some made up excuse that I have plans the day after.

I said we can meet some other time. But then she changed her mind and said she doesn’t want to push the date further and said we should just stick to the original date. I tried saying no but she insisted and I gave in. We met on the original date.

The meeting, surprisingly, went very well. There was no tension. We are both passionate about music and had a great conversation. Somehow at the end of the meeting, we made another plan (mutually) to meet up again the following monday, as I would be leaving town on Tue and won’t be returning back for a year.

However, the problem started here. We had a class the day after our initial meeting and when she casually asked how my day was, I replied (honestly) that it was a lazy relaxing day at home. I completely forgot that I earlier gave her an excuse that I have plans (when she tried to postpone our initial meeting). I think she caught this and scoffed. From that point onwards, her behaviour was a bit off. She was still polite but more professional (which seemed weird to me because we usually speak very casually and joke around). Usually after our lesson time ends, we casually talk about music or personal projects we are working on and our calls extend for at least 30-40 min post our lesson time. But on this day, she ended the call exactly on time.

I felt a bit uncomfortable afterward but didn’t say anything, mostly because I was more upset with myself. When she was flaky about our first meeting, I had a valid reason to say no and should have done so directly. Instead, I impulsively made up an excuse to avoid meeting, then later forgot about it. When it came up again, I spoke honestly without remembering the earlier excuse, which made things awkward.

But I didn’t say anything. I hoped if we meet on monday we can clear it. I was even willing to apologize for not being honest and explain my reasons.

But she didn’t text on Sun about meeting the following day. I didn’t either. This whole situation has been making me anxious and I decided that if she didn’t text this time, I would end this ‘friendship’ and just be professional from now on.

The meeting on monday never happened. We had another group lesson today and I kept things strictly professional, though I was polite the whole time. She caught this and tried to ask if something was wrong, I said no. After the lesson, she texted me asking why I was dull in class today. And then said ***“I know we were supposed to meet yesterday, but I was too lazy to come. I thought you were busy too because you didn’t text.”***

I am so irritated by this - I feel like she knows exactly what is happening but is pretending as if she’s got no clue. I don’t like ignoring people usually, I feel like its childish to ignore someone but I’ve had situations in the past where when I tried explaining, they would twist it to make themselves the victim and make me the bad guy. So I didn’t say anything. I am just thinking of replying ""**I’m okay, don’t worry about it.**” and hoping she gets the hint and just drops it. And then I want to keep things strictly professional from now on. We only have 2 more lessons, I’m planning to switch to a different teacher after that.

I’m someone who takes plans seriously. If I’ve agreed to meet and later realize I can’t make it, I make sure to inform the other person as early as possible because I value their time. Her approach seems different she’s comfortable canceling or changing plans at the last minute without much notice. I’m not trying to decide who’s right or wrong, but that kind of behaviour doesn’t sit well with me. It feels wrong to me, and since she doesn’t seem to recognise why it’s an issue, I don’t want to continue the friendship.

And moreover this whole thing is making me so anxious! Life is short and I don’t want to waste time with drama like this.

In hindsight, I learned a big lesson - to never let friendship in professional situations. And to just be blunt and say NO without lying to give explanations on why I can’t meet.

**My question -What’s the best way to respond to her message so I can keep things peaceful, professional, and not awkward until the remaining lessons are done?**

And it used to, and still douse absolutely terrify me! But I’ve learned a few things that have helped me and now I’m gonna shove that information on to you guys! 

1. Prayers help, I’m non religious myself, but saying little things like, “I’m safe”, “this plane that I’m on, is gonna be fine” and then thinking of the most precise way I can describe myself and the plane I’m on, to make sure whoever is hearing me knows which flight I’m taking lol! It helps to distract me Evan though it’s kinda silly. 

2. Before the plane Evan leaves the ground, maybe Evan on your drive to the airport imagine all the bumps that you feel as the vehicle moves forward. These bumps are probably worse than the turbulence you may experience. And while you’re in the plane and feel some turbulence, just think back to those bumps during driving how they might have been worse then the bumping now but you weren’t afraid then so why should you be now?

3. Incase the turbulence gets worse, I recommend, lifting your feet a bit off the ground, and maybe Evan hopping up and down in your chair a a little if you’re not too embarrassed! It’ll make you feel it less!!

4. Research about how plains ACTUALLY work. Think about WHAT it is you’re scared of and combat those fears one by one. Are you scared of dropping? Planes can usually regain control Evan after dropping a bit. A plane can still land safely Evan if only one engine is intact. Planes can’t bump into each other in flight as there are so many safety procedures against it! The wings of a plane are extremely bendable and are extremely unlikely to ever snap!I recommend checking out more stuff about how incredibly safe planes are, I’m sure it’ll give you some reassurance!

5. For the love of god, unless you REALLY think it might help you, don’t watch planes crash videos right before you go into your plane-
Also don’t drink coffee, increases anxiety.

6. Look at all the planes taking off there not crashing!

7. Find a good distraction, one that needs focus, whether that’s a video game, art, or something else. Do it! I also really like looking out the window, it’s might seem like the opposite of what you’d want, but it helps with no being surprised by random motions, when it’s usually just the pilot turning! Also the view is great!

8. Remember, the pilots and flight crew don’t want to die either, nor be in much discomfort. They’ll always try to make the flight as smooth and safe as possible for you and themselves! If the flight crew ain’t stressing neither should you, and Evan if they are, might just want to make sure your seatbelts are buckled👍

9. Text someone before you take off, “hey I’m gonna be on a flight to( ), text you when I get there”. Idk why but it’s kind of reassuring, like your making a promise to yourself, or you’ve seen so many people text you the same thing and most likely end up texting you again after there flight.

10. If you’re still really scared, take a melatonin, try to fall asleep before the plain Evan gets in the air, you might be so tired you won’t Evan care it’s going up.

11. Act like you don’t care, fake it till you make it. Once again. Oddly reassuring, maybe Evan try thinking of it as fun! 

12. Feeling like you’re not in control sucks, imagine, you’re controlling the plane, try to believe it as much as possible. Once again silly, but still helps.

I’m just short of two years away from my son turning 18, and I will then be free to move. I’m only in my current area for custody reasons, and of course my son and what opportunities he wants to take will be thought about!

But this’ll be the first time I’ve had to think about just what I want. I’m single, so no partner to consider (unless that changes at some point, fingers crossed). I’ll have no kids under 18. I don’t have anything I’d consider roots anywhere really. I have some good friendships around the country, but nothing that would pull me anywhere. So I’d love to start thinking about where I might want to go.

So what I’m looking for in a place would be…

1. Affordability. I don’t have a high income career, and my goal is to be able to afford basic life things and some fun activities without being super stressed. A community with a lot of fun/cheap activities would be awesome, too.

2. Opportunities for my interests: a community with crafting opportunities, specifically pottery and sewing. 

3. Vegan friendly: I don’t eat out much, but it’s nice to be able to have options when I’m able to! 

4. A really good coffee roaster!

5. A fairly creative community feel. I’d like to be able to dress in fun ways without feeling like I stick out.

I can barely keep my eyes open all day. Coffee, yawning, exhausted. Then night comes, I get into bed, lights off… and suddenly my brain is fully online.



Thoughts start flying.

Random memories.

Worrying about sleep itself.

Checking how tired I feel, checking if it’s “working”.



It’s like my body is tired but my mind missed the memo.



Anyone else deal with this? Is this an insomnia thing or more of an anxiety/overthinking thing?

   Me, now 19F and my ex, Josh now 19M dated a few years ago in high school and were together for over a year. We had so much fun, getting to be together almost everyday, spending time with our families, making up our own games, being goofy and just being able to be ourselves. I believe we were and are each others first love and that’s hard to forget. 
Near the end, him and I both had a conversation about potentially breaking up and mutually agreeing that we got into too much of a routine, we both weren’t happy and basically bored. After a year of constant us, we took every opportunity to see each other and didn’t take into account that being apart was okay, would’ve helped our situation and it was too late to try something new to help the spark come back because we didn’t know otherwise, being young and stupid is a joy. 
After that, there was typical relationship drama and getting used to no more gm or gn texts, feelings hurt. But that was around two years ago. Throughout that time, things got tense. He didn’t want to let me go, he didn’t understand, he was sad and angry. It hurt me seeing him like that but it scared me and made my situation even sadder. He would reach out wanting to argue, figure it out and then apologize and it got to the point where I had to block him, it got too much for me, but he never stopped trying to reach out. 
It’s hard to understand from an outside pov of course, but truly he is a great guy overall and has proved that he can love and care for me no matter what, I’m a very complicated person, I have mental struggles, odd/ unique interests that would be hard for most to understand and I feel he’s the only one that truly loves me for me. The lashing out did scare me, but I think he is and was scared himself. We both didn’t know how to handle this situation. However, now that we’ve grown a bit and have had new life experiences to teach us and help us be more mature. I feel confident enough to reach out myself, go talk at a coffee shop or something and really try to understand each other. 
My love has never faded, however, I wouldn’t be going into this expecting a relationship, or for him to have changed or for it to even go smoothly skipping off into the sunset. 
We both have changed so much, I can’t even say I know him anymore. I don’t know what to expect. But I’m willing to let him in to see if there is any way we can express ourselves more maturely. Possibly get some closure and be comfortable with each other again, in person or not being hesitant to text. 
The majority would say “never get back with your ex, you can’t change someone” and what not, but please try and see it differently. Trust me I have thought of every situation, the good and bad and how peoples reactions would be, but there’s no set rules for love. And I need help deciding if there’s hope to at least be civil, a potential friendship again or if I just let it go and keep my focus elsewhere. But I will always love him no matter what.

Hi! I’m 16F, I’m from the west coast. Growing up I was raised very Lutheran by my father (but was baptized catholic as a baby). Despite being raised very religious, i definitely did not have the best childhood. My parents divorced when I was three, because of my mothers infidelity and my fathers anger issues. I had to grow up traveling between the two houses.

 My father used to terrify me as a child because he spent most of his time yelling at me. He’s a bad chainsmoker, and I’ve seen him watching porn once or twice before just openly in the living room (despite how much he preaches Christianity). My mother is not religious at all. She was a good mom until I was about eight, and then she became an alcoholic and moved us in with her boyfriend (a random man) because we couldn’t afford to live in our apartment any longer (her boyfriend is super disrespectful and never leaves the house because he got fired for drug abuse) . Now she acts like she’s my age, she dresses like a teenager, she parties, and leaves home (where we live still with her boyfriend), to “hang out with other guys” for weeks at a time. She has her good moments but most of the time I kinda wish I had different parents (I know it’s bad to think).

Overall, I’m really struggling because of my situation, and the fact I’m lost religiously. Ive been learning more about the LDS church, and it seems like something I would really enjoy! I have a few concerns though. 

I’ve heard different people tell me about how the LDS church is super welcoming and kind! Which I hope is true but I’ve also heard that it can also be super judgmental? I’m not sure what to believe. I also feel somewhat tainted due to the fact I haven’t been the best Christian. I don’t party, or drink, or drugs—I’ve never even had a boyfriend before. I’m pretty quiet and stay home a lot to bake. But I do read adult books with adult themes in them. I feel that knowing about sex/being lustful, and reading about it, makes me less of a Christian, especially in the eyes of LDS. I also love to drink coffee and tea. 

I have wanted to be a mom all my life and that’s something very important to me!  I know it’s highly encouraged for women in LDS to get married and have kids, I have no problem with that at all. I wanted to be a stay at home mom since I was little, but as I’ve gotten older my mother has taught me that I should want something more and I’d regret my life if I didn’t get a job. I know she’d be upset with me if I didn’t have a big career. I’m struggling myself with deciding between the two. 

I would love to go to a sacrament meeting at a local LDS church but I doubt my mother would ever drive me there. And I know all my friends and family would disapprove of it or make fun of me. I don’t have any options to meet people apart of LDS. I’m very interested in the church and joining but I have all these fears about it. Maybe my mind would be changed if I actually went to a service but I don’t have any options as of right now to go to one. I think meeting members would actually help me decide. Any helpful advice would be greatly appreciated. (Sorry If my grammar is misspelt or nothing makes sense I’m writing this as fast as possible lol)

I’m honestly kind of scared that I’ll get picked on by doctors or fellow med students in the future because even back in medtech undergrad, my classmates and sometimes even lab instructors would comment (and make fun of) how shaky my hands were during retdem (like veni or other lab activities that need manual dexterity). During my internship, even my very first phlebotomy patient pointed it out.

I haven’t seen a specialist about it since it hasn’t affected my day-to-day life, just my confidence. I’ve noticed that the shakiness gets worse when I’m stressed or anxious, when I’m being observed during skills lab, and when I drink more coffee (which is honestly unavoidable). When I’m calm or really “in the zone,” it’s still there but barely noticeable. Unfortunately, staying 'calm' in a high-pressure environment is way easier said than done.”

**Location:** Brisbane Queen Street Mall

**Energy:** 4 out of 10

**Mood:** Feeling pretty exhausted after the weekend. I stayed up late Friday night checking out Fortitude Valley, stayed up late with Mayo on Saturday, and then stayed up late on Sunday after my date with Lizzie and talking with Pat. I was really feeling burnt out and resistant

**Limiting Beliefs:** I won't know what to say, these girls are too busy, I am not good at this, these girls won't like me, I'm too old for these girls, I just want to get home

**Social Exposure:** 12 approaches, 2 solid stops, really not feeling social

**Day Summary:**

The day started with me waking up at 8:30am after not getting to bed again until almost 3am. I think I got 15 hours of sleep in the last 3 days so I have a lot of sleep debt. My throat was also feeling a bit scratchy after my date with Lizzie so I didn't sleep the best.

I forced myself to go out at noon to go and get some approaches done. I was really tired and had a lot of resistance to going out there today. I filmed a quick clip for the YouTube video and instead of whining I just got up and went. I know if I take the day off I will easily find reasons to not keep going with the challenge.

The approaches today were a bit rough. I was not in a great mood, I felt very nervous today and I was not very energetic. It doesn't help that I am telling myself I don't want to do this before going out, so I will change this self talk and tell myself I am grateful I get to do this and work on my skillset. Great things can happen.

Not much to speak of in terms of the approaches today. Many were quick blowouts, girls with boyfriends, or me just running out of things to say. I did have a solid interaction with a girl from Hungary who was with her boyfriend in Brisbane though. They were very nice and cool and was great to be able to be non-reactive and fine talking to them after he came into the set.

I went out in the evening with George and we did a few more sets. I ended up getting to 12 for the day. It was way more fun going out with him, than by myself, but I will do what it takes to get to 10 everyday. George got in at least 5 I think and had a decent interaction or two.

It actually felt great not having any dates today and I could just chill for the night, now that my approaches were over. I was still feeling under the weather so it was nice to go with George and just chill in the sauna and recap how fun this is and the interesting experiences we have been having.

My plan was to go to bed around 10pm, but we started to watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. George is really liking the show which is great to share it with him. I was sending out my messages for the day and watching the show and didn't get to bed until 11:30pm

I was wanting to go bed, but I just couldn't do it without posting a new YouTube video, even if it wasn't good and was low energy. I ended up posting this and getting to bed around 1am and then I woke up at 10am today. I still have a lot of sleep debt though

**Biggest Lesson / Takeaway for the Day:**

* I was actually grateful to have all blowouts today and not have any dates tonight. I was hard on myself thinking I should be performing better with my social skills and conversation skills, but I guess sometimes you just have ""bad"" days and need the break to rest

**Top 3 Interactions:**

* Hungarian girl with her boyfriend. Although she was in a relationship she was very friendly and cute and thanked me for talking to them. It was also nice talking to someone from Hungary as I was just reflecting the other day on how I haven't met anyone from there yet.
* The girl from Thailand was cool because I could see the attraction spike in her eyes. She was completely stunned that I stopped her and she was contributing a bit to the conversation, but I wasn't able to lead it, so she left. Good learning lesson though and showed girls love being stopped by attractive guys
* 20 year old girl eating Takis. She was very pretty with her dress and she seemed receptive as well. I ran out of things to say and got in my head that she was too young and not interested. This is a pretty stupid limiting belief as I was just making out with a 20 year old on my balcony last night. I got in my head and then bailed though. Good practice and something to work on

**What will I work on tomorrow:**

* I will film a positive message before my approaches talking about how excited I am and grateful I am to be out on Queen Street.

**Approaches:**

1. First approach of the day was a blonde girl in a black dress. She was walking pretty fast. She went inside a building and was waiting for the elevator. I said she looked nice. I didn't really tease, and then I tried to do a cold read, and she said she had to go. But good to get it done. The first one is the worst one.
2. very hesitant to do the second approach. I've seen a lot of girls walk by that I didn't open, feeling that they were too hot for me or I wouldn't have anything to say. I stopped a girl on the sidewalk and said she looked very dressed up like she was an assassin. She laughed, but then I tried to move out of traffic and she kept walking. She did not stop.
3. There was a girl waiting to cross the streets. I said she looked nice. She just said thanks and put her earphones back in.
4. Still feeling the nerves. I've done four approaches now. The last girl was very tall. She was wearing heels, so I teased her that she was like an elegant giraffe. I was not very squared up in front of her, though. I also was a little bit clunky in the interaction. She did say thanks. She did have a boyfriend already. She was from Brisbane. I could have just been a little bit more playful and loose, but the nerves were there.
5. Came back out, did an approach on a girl who was from Thailand. She's been here for three years, 25. She was very stunned when I stopped her, kind of in shock. She was not really hooking or giving me much, and kept wanting to leave. She was on her way to catch her bus, so probably not a lot I could do, but I did not feel super confident either. Good to get in this set overall.
6. Blonde girl look very happy. I stopped her first thing she said to me was that she had a boyfriend, so clearly my intention is on display. Nothing I could do with that. 
7. Try to stop a girl and open her. She just looked at me and walked past. She didn’t even stop. I kind of was on the side of her as well, so that probably did not help. 
8. Cute girl. Was walking very slow. I stopped her and said she looked like she was on her way to teach children. She did not really hook. She just stared at ME. She is Philippine and Japanese, but she lives here. She was on her way to go meet friends. I didn’t really know what else to say in the interaction, so I bailed. 
9. Try to get in front of a girl. She did not stop. She just kept walking. She was basically fucking running when I was trying to catch up to her so she must’ve been in a hurry. What are you gonna do? 
10. There was a Korean girl, who is walking and looking at her phone. She seemed receptive. I kept talking, but she walked off. She was looking for something, and might be in a hurry. 
11. There was a cute girl in a dress, and she was eating Takis, so I went in and stopped her. She was only 20. She’s from India. She’s been here for seven years. I ran out of things to say she was very receptive of the compliment, but I was not leading the interaction very well. 
12. Was having coffee with George and saw a cute girl standing against the railing. I went in and said she looked nice and she hooked pretty quickly. She is from Hungary so it was easy to talk to her. She is living here and looking for a job. She is traveling with her boyfriend who came into set. The conversation was pretty easy and they were good people. She thanked me for stopping and talking to them.

I've been playing Space Haven for a couple of months, and one of the things that always bugged me was not being able to plan my ship in advance (the game plan tool is quite limited). So, I built a small tool called ""Space Haven Planner"" to help plan ship layouts before you commit time/resources in-game.

I would love you guys to try it: [https://spacehavenplanner.com](https://spacehavenplanner.com)

https://preview.redd.it/nbgas7f6c1dg1.png?width=3446&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a1b4791a7a0e5a3c40a237e43a93543f144360

The tool is completely open-source, you can check/fork/whatever the code here: [https://github.com/delucca/space-haven-planner](https://github.com/delucca/space-haven-planner)

Also, you don't need to create any account. All the data is stored in your browser :)

Anyway, here is a couple of things the tool does:

* Tile-based ship grid with common canvas presets
* Structure palette + rotation + placement validation (no accidental overlaps / out-of-bounds)
* Layers + organization so big layouts stay manageable
* Autosave locally (no accounts, no backend)
* Export to PNG (shareable) and JSON (editable / portable)
* Automatic integration with the game, I imported the most recent JAR file, so the catalog is updated
* Integration with fandom Wiki to display images/infos
* Optional: import your own spacehaven.jar so the structure catalog matches your game version (it parses locally in the browser and caches it for next time)

If you try it, and find any bugs, or want any specific features, please click on the ""Support"" button on the bottom left and send me a message there 🙌

The tool is totally free, but there is a link to my ""Buy Me a Coffee"" profile if you want to help me to keep the servers running 🙏

The wood is walnut that I milled and finished for a prior build (posted last night) and repurposed here for the monolithic style of the case. 

Shown is a coffee table that I built years ago that coincidentally perfectly houses the accompanying Lap Desk for the build. I do use the PC for art and other purposes, so finding this Rossie Home product was a perfect match in color scheme and concept for the times when needed.

The Steam controller is shown mostly to accentuate build concept and is a placeholder until the new one releases.

1qbfi6z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qbfi6z,"O by Claude Le Tohic (*) - San Francisco, CA","Overview:

O is a French restaurant with a bit of a Californian twist that to me adds a level of excitement and interest. The location of the restaurant itself is pretty strange in that you enter on the narrow ground level which is like their pastry shop, and each floor is a different restaurant or something. So from the bakery you take the elevator up to the 5th floor which is where this restaurant is. Exiting the elevator you are already in the restaurant at the reception area, so theres no hallway or extravagant entrance or anything, but from there its a normal fine dinning experience.


There is a 5 course menu (which is actually 6 courses) for $210 and 9 course menu for $295. The menus have some overlap but some differences so its not like the 9 course is just 3 extra courses. In fact to me some of the items on the 5 course seemed more interesting so I went with that, and Im glad that I did, so just make sure you check the different menus to see which one you prefer. They did call me ahead of time to choose which menu I wanted to go with, though the table next to me apparently pre-selected the 5 course and changed it to the 9 course at the start of dinner and it was no problem at all.


The 5 course was enough food for me, especially since you can pick many different breads and many different chocolates. There are also some supplements including a cheese trolly for $38 which was my initial plan to go with in case the 5 course menu wasn’t enough food, but it was. I’m glad I didnt get it though because I assumed (and was hoping) for it to be focused on French/European cheeses, but I believe it was all only cheeses from America.

Service was professional and friendly and I would say above average for a * here in SF.

Overall this place is rarely ever talked about, but was actually quite a pleasant surprise and i enjoyed it and would recommend others to try it.

I’m currently thinking about where I went wrong navigating my current situation. I (27F) am currently in a relationship with my partner (30M) and have a lot on my plate. We just finished moving into a new apartment (took us about half a month to move), while I’m enrolled in school for a medical program and work full time. Before moving, my partner asked me how he can help me with juggling work and school. I told him it would help if he helped more around the apartment (picking up cleaning, cooking) since I take night classes and won’t be around as much.

Well I’m week two into my classes and I feel like I’m dealing with more at home? We split cooking but I’m always meal prepping breakfast for us, sometimes lunch/dinner for the next day if we get to cooking it. We split chores and I handle my cleaning but he’s given the excuse he couldn’t get to his cleaning because “he doesn’t have the time” = this Sunday, while he built a coffee stand for the apartment, I put away all groceries from grocery shopping, meal prepped breakfast and lunch and cleaned/dusted the apartment. He asked if I can help and clean while I’m wfh which I’m not going to do as I’ve been booked with work and use my lunch break to study/review for my science class. He also makes me feel like I’m not doing as much around the apartment when I’m exhausted from studying and having to do labs. 

I would also like to say on his free time he games while I study/do homework. We work different schedules (him 6-2, me the regular 9-5). I feel like he does have the time but doesn’t use it to be productive.

1qbfb6e,https://i.redd.it/48gj8i1c31dg1.jpeg,What the Hell is… Quantum Physics?,"Quantum physics isn’t just a collection of equations; it’s the universe’s secret language, whispering truths about existence that are both mind-boggling and awe-inspiring.

As you delve into this classical beginner’s guide to Quantum Theory, remember that these rules, while inherently related to the quantum realm, can feel nonintuitive. They form the bedrock of particle physics, and if you struggle with some of these concepts, you're not alone. Even the legendary physicist Richard Feynman famously said, “If you think you understand quantum theory, you don’t.” So, let’s take this journey together into the bizarre and wonderful world of quantum mechanics.

The Quantum Basics
Wave-Particle Duality Picture light as a multitasking actor playing different roles depending on the situation. Sometimes it behaves like a tiny bullet of energy (a photon), and other times, it acts like a spread-out ripple, much like ocean waves. This isn’t a glitch in the matrix—it’s simply how nature functions at the smallest scales. So, when you flick on a light switch, you’re not just illuminating a room; you’re engaging with a fundamental aspect of reality.
Uncertainty Principle Here’s where it gets a bit tricky. You can’t know everything about a particle at once. It’s like trying to photograph a hummingbird in mid-flight. If you focus on its position, you lose track of its speed. Conversely, if you try to pinpoint its speed, its location becomes a blur. This is Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle: the more you pin down one detail, the fuzzier the other becomes. It’s nature’s way of keeping some secrets close to its chest.
Quantum Entanglement Now, imagine two particles that are essentially “soulmates,” connected across vast distances—like cosmic pen pals. When you change one particle, the other reacts instantaneously, even if they’re separated by billions of miles. Einstein famously despised this “spooky action at a distance,” but experiments confirm it’s real. It’s as if the universe has a secret communication system that defies our everyday understanding of distance and time.
The Observer Effect Here’s a fun twist: particles behave differently when they’re being watched. It’s not just shyness; it’s math! Until you measure a particle, it exists in all possible states at once, much like a spinning coin in the air. Your observation “freezes” it into one outcome. So, in some ways, you’re not just a bystander in this cosmic play; you’re an active participant shaping reality.
Mind-Bending Implications
Schrödinger’s Cat (Simplified) Let’s take a moment for a thought experiment that’ll blow your mind. Imagine a cat in a box with a poison trigger tied to a radioactive atom. Until you peek inside, the atom is both decayed and intact—so the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. It’s a wild concept, but it highlights how reality “chooses” its state only when observed.

Time, Relativity, and You Enter Einstein, who gave us mind-bending revelations:

Time slows down if you’re moving really fast—like when you’re zooming near the speed of light.
And remember E=mc²? It tells us that mass and energy are interchangeable, explaining everything from nuclear power to why you can’t outrun light. It’s a reminder that our intuitive understandings of time and space are just the tip of the iceberg.
Why the Universe Isn’t “Common Sense”
Let’s face it: the universe doesn’t always play by our rules.

Entropy: This is the idea that the universe is slowly falling apart—like your coffee cooling down or stars burning out. It proves that everything has a beginning, initiated by the Big Bang.
Before the Big Bang? Time didn’t exist. Asking “what came before” is like asking “what’s north of the North Pole.” Mind-bending, right?
Science vs. Spirituality?
Now, here’s where it gets even deeper. Quantum physics doesn’t disprove God; rather, it deepens the mystery of existence. Paul Davies argues that the universe’s laws are too intricate to be mere accidents. Whether you lean toward spirituality or science, quantum theory forces us to ask:

Is reality just a complex math equation?
Does consciousness shape what we perceive?
Einstein’s version of God wasn’t a bearded figure in the clouds; it was the “mind” behind the elegance of nature.

Why This Matters to You
Quantum physics isn’t just confined to labs and textbooks; it has real-world applications that affect our daily lives:

It gave us lasers, smartphones, and MRI machines—technology we often take for granted.
It explains why the sun shines through nuclear fusion and how our eyes perceive light.
Yet perhaps the biggest lesson it teaches us is humility. The universe is weirder, wilder, and more wondrous than we ever imagined.

The Takeaway
You don’t need a PhD to appreciate the quirkiness of quantum mechanics. The next time you gaze up at Orion’s Belt or plug in your phone, remember that beneath all of it lies a realm where particles teleport, time bends, and “impossible” is just another equation waiting to be solved.

As Paul Davies says, the universe isn’t a puzzle to solve; it’s a story to explore. And you, my friend, are a vital part of that story.

There is this guy from high school that I kind of lost touch with. We texted a few times in college and then again recently. I had a huge crush on him in high school and I have always wondered about him and what could have been. This last time we talked I reached out to him to ask him a question about something that happened in high school and we also caught up a little bit. He lives out of state now so I told him if he was ever back home that he should let me know and we could catch up some more. I didn’t really expect him to reach out, but to my surprise he did! We met up at a coffee shop near both of us and we talked for 2 hours inside until they closed and then another hour outside in the parking lot. It felt like neither of us really wanted the night to end. Since we had our meeting we have texted a few times. We wished each other Merry Christmas and Happy New Year’s and there were a few other random texts. But I really wish we could talk on a more regular basis. I don’t mean like every day but maybe a couple times a week? Or even like once a week. I don’t necessarily want it to be romantic conversation I just want us to talk more in general. I would be fine if it’s just friends and if it goes well then maybe it could be romantic in the future. But if it doesn’t turn romantic that would be ok too. I just really like talking to him! I’m just not sure how to approach the subject. I want to be somewhat straightforward and tell him I would like to talk more often I’m just not exactly sure how to say it.

this man-boy who just got hired at the job may be one of the most annoying fucking coworkers in existence. i’ve had a few. but this one. i mean damn. so, i started working at this one shop in the last few months. the whole transition was brought on by some bullshit at another shop. i was splitting time between this job and another one but ive settled down a bit at this one. it’s fine. my coworkers are kinda weird but all generally nice enough, and i’ve actually grown pretty fond of a few of them. we we work together, we have a nice time.

anyways. we recently did a round of hiring. got this new girl who’s younger, another new hire who’s been in coffee for a while and has their own pop-up. an older guy who has some coffee experience. and then, the star of the show. this dude in his late twenties who is just an absolute prize. so my first shift with him was his second or third day on the job, i don’t recognize him but i know he’s gotta be one of the new hires. whatever. it gets a little chaotic in the shop so i clock in, look for the gaps to fill. do some dishes. someone orders a pour over; i go to make it. maybe i’d just done the bloom and all of a sudden he’s off my right shoulder, talkin bout some “you wanna show me how to do that?” i get a little overstimulated so it’s not the most welcome thing atm but im always down to show someone how to do something if they’re asking. i go “ya, just let me finish making this and i’ll walk you through it. right this minute might not be the best time”. he comes back at me like “actually i think rn is the perfect time”. and i had to give it to him, that was original. no one ever hit me with that one before. ate up all my RAM. now i’m aware that everyone is different. some ppl are close talkers with halitosis. some ppl are fucking hard of hearing. still others hopelessly neurodivergent. there all kinds of little things that make working with others not-so-straightforward. but it didn’t take me long to clock that this guy was one of those guys that gets off on being an inconveniently placed hemorrhoid right next to the asshole of wage slavery we all have the distinct pleasure of having to wipe for our entire lives. 

basic disrespect is where it started. ask him to wash the dishes, he fucks off and leaves em dirty, ask him to clean a table, he pretends he doesn’t hear me. he doesn’t clean a damn thing and the only time he suddenly busies himself with tasks is to avoid doing other shit. why is that our worst coworker is also the only person on the team who thinks they’re above all the other shit the rest of us willingly do to keep the place running? i let it ride for a minute. but one thing im not is a doormat. so i let my manager know about the difficulty, y’know, due diligence. but then i start a lil squeeze. kicking him off the espresso machine, because why should anyone let you make drinks when you can’t be bothered to do all the basic shit around that? we constantly have to ask him to clean the matcha bowl/wipe the steam wand when he does make drinks. he insists he knows better than everyone but he’s got the worst latte art (doesn’t stop him from critiquing everyone else’s work) he’ll outright lie if it makes him look good in front of our boss. literally no one on the team gets along with this guy. and worst of all, no matter how many times he’s told that we’re trying to help him and he’s just getting in his own way, he won’t listen. even though he’s spectacularly wrong every time he loudly opens his fucking mouth. he’s a whiner who can’t take the same sort of criticism he fucking dishes out, he’s honestly an embarrassing waste of flesh. i sort of feel bad for him given his crippling character flaw but also he’s so exhausting to deal with im halfway between suggesting an ayahuasca trip to him and praying for some act of god/accident to leave him vegetative. it’s not that serious, i’m quitting soon but i hope to see him get punched in the face real hard. 

tldr; my coworker sucks because his objective at work is protecting his precious ego instead of being a part of the team and it’ll get him fired but nowhere near soon enough. i love coffee but today i hate it.",8,1768271142.0,barista,3,0.79,False

1qbf3ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/1qbf3ka/nerve_pain_years_after_radiation/,Nerve pain years after radiation?,"My partner survived Hodgkin’s Lymphoma as a young man (early 20s). He went through many rounds of chemo and then radiation targeting his neck. He is now in his late 40s and generally healthy, but every night he has terrible nerve pain in his neck that leads to horrific headaches and as a result sleep is almost impossible. 

He sees a pain specialist and is prescribed the highest level of opiates that are legally available in our country, but those barely touch the pain. He gets some pain relief from strong coffee or caffeine pills, but that obviously works against sleep, and he’s also recently tried nicotine which seemed to help but he found himself craving it during the day so that’s a no. In the past he’s had nerve blocks but they didn’t help. He is frustrated and feels out of options and anything I suggest gets shut down immediately.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Is it hopeless? If he’d listen, I’d suggest:

- Because he’s awake all night miserable, he generally sleeps all morning until mid-afternoon. (Luckily his job allows for this!) He basically eats nothing before dinnertime. Maybe food is somehow triggering the nerve pain and headaches? If he ate in the morning and stopped at lunch, he might feel better at night? I can’t think of any other reason that the pain only comes on at night.  

- Maybe he needs to try a detox from all the coffee and stuff? At night he’s up and down every hour taking a pill or drinking more coffee. I understand that it alleviates the pain but I do wonder if there’s some rebound/cumulative effect going on. If he could go a week without the caffeine and then see if he still feels he needs so much? I know he’s be in abject misery but it might be worth it.

- I know a brilliant acupuncturist, he’s dismissed it as ‘woo’ but she is genuinely amazing, I have no idea if she could help him or not but he won’t even let me call her to ask…

It’s difficult as his partner to see him struggling every night but also difficult to put up with him being grouchy and irritable and snapping at me   If I try to suggest there might be something that could help (even years in the future, like a trial or something) when he’s decided he’s just done for and this is his nightmare forever. Any ideas? If not, any advice for how to support someone through something that isn’t getting better and is incredibly painful every night?

It‘s about a company that built a cult-like following and a billion-dollar business by pursuing a goal that seems insane: **to make you buy less.**

**The Scene: 2011, The Peak of Consumerism**
The outdoor industry was racing to sell more “stuff”—lighter jackets, newer gear. The model was “planned obsolescence” and endless consumption. Patagonia‘s founder, Yvon Chouinard, looked at this and asked a first-principles question that went beyond business:

> **“What is a product‘s *true responsibility* to its owner and the planet?”**

His answer was radical: **A product should be a lifelong tool, not disposable seasonal fashion.** The company‘s purpose wasn‘t to maximize sales, but to **minimize its total environmental impact.**

**The “First Principles” Breakdown:**
Patagonia rejected the “sell more, grow faster” axiom. It rebuilt its entire model around one core belief:
1.  **The True Product:** **Trust and a philosophy.** The jacket is just the physical token.
2.  **The Core Metric:** Not quarterly sales, but **product lifespan and brand integrity.**
3.  **The Inevitable Conclusion:** The most responsible thing is to help customers **repair, reuse, and deeply consider each purchase.**

**The Brutal, Simple Inferences & Counter-Intuitive Actions:**
*   **“Don‘t Buy This Jacket” Campaign:** In 2011, they ran a Black Friday ad with this headline, detailing the environmental cost of their best-selling jacket. It urged customers to think before consuming.
*   **Lifetime Repair Guarantee:** They built the **Worn Wear program**, repairing gear for free or low cost. This turned a cost center into their most powerful marketing—a walking billboard of durability.
*   **Selling Used Gear:** They actively **resell their own used products** on their platform, cannibalizing new sales but capturing value and customers at a different point in the lifecycle.

**The Result:**
They didn‘t shrink; they exploded. By aligning their actions with a deeper customer value (environmentalism and integrity), they fostered **fanatical loyalty.** Customers didn‘t just buy a jacket; they **joined a tribe.** Their “anti-growth” stance became their strongest growth engine, allowing them to charge premium prices and attract talent competitors couldn‘t. They proved that in a transparent world, **the most radical, authentic mission can be the ultimate competitive moat.**

**The Hustle Insight:**
Don‘t just sell a product. **Sell a belief system and take tangible, costly actions to prove you mean it.** The strongest brand isn‘t the one that shouts the loudest about being the best; it‘s the one that willingly sacrifices short-term sales to uphold a long-term principle that its customers share.

---

**Your Turn: The “Purpose Architect” Challenge**
To exercise your **“Strategic Thinker”** muscles:

1.  **Deconstruct the Belief:** What was the **core, non-commercial belief** that Patagonia‘s entire business model was built to serve?
    *   *Format*: “**The Core Belief:** [e.g., ‘A company‘s ultimate responsibility is to be a steward of the planet, even at the expense of its own immediate growth‘]. **The Proof Point:** [The ‘Don‘t Buy‘ ad, the Worn Wear program].”

2.  **Apply the Thinking:** For a **commodity industry** (e.g., coffee, apparel, electronics), design a “sacrificial” action that would prove a deeper brand purpose.
    *   *Format*: “**For a [Smartphone Brand]:** If the belief is ‘Technology should serve humans for years, not months,‘ a Patagonia-style action would be **guaranteeing 7 years of software updates and modular, user-replaceable batteries**, even if it hurts new model sales.”

**Why This Matters:**

Coaching was handled well and it’s made it really easy to excel as a barista. The shifts I work with is so friendly, talkative, and professional it makes all the peaks so fun to work. Except when I work with this one specific shift lead…

At first they were so nice to me, joked with me, genuinely complimented me and so fun to work with. They were firm about their coaching, micromanaged a bit but it helped me become better. Then everything took a turn when I hurt my hand and had to wear an oversized glove. Tickets kept getting stuck to it, it made it hard to accurately press buttons on the register; I got flustered and lowkey embarrassed for taking a bit longer to ring customers up and do warming. 

And this specific shift lead got more and more annoyed at me that day to the point they looked at me with dagger eyes and blatantly ignored what I say. Clarifications for “ask me”, anything I’m low on when in a planted position, they’d get pissed and put someone else on CS so they can grab whatever I asked for. 

They’re like this with a few other baristas. But the ones that they like, they’re next to them, joking with them, works tasks with them side by side. Gives them tasks that can help set them up for a future shift role. But when I’m tasked to do them they get quiet, walks off and I’m left alone. They don’t trust me during peaks (when other shifts do and I have done well during them), and pull me off of tasks before I can even get started on them. Any questions I have I’d rather ask another barista bc it’d annoy them to answer me.

I honestly don’t care to be friends with them. But it makes it really difficult to work when they’re leading the shift. It feels bad when someone acts like they can’t stand to be near you. I’ve tried being friendly but that pisses them off even more. It really lowers my morale and makes it hard to upkeep positive energy esp with customers. I feel so much dread when I see them leading.

With other shifts it’s like night and day. I’ve closed and open with them and instead of feeling beat down, I feel so energized and happy to work. They’ve left me appreciative comment cards, we can talk coffee, connect on stuff. I don’t know. It’s just so weird how quickly that shift started hating me? I waited and waited for coaching bc I thought it was that, but the SM kept telling me I was doing well. 

I’ve read posts from other partners on here that’s had worse experiences so I don’t know if this is worth bringing up to my SM. Big sigh",1,1768270288.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False

Just wondering what you would do in the situation and if there's any recourse.

Honestly, it's not the worst situation, but my wife and I are quite annoyed.

We hosted a family over new years - they said they'd be 6 guests, which is the most we allow. They stayed 2 nights - December 31st, January 1st and left on the 2nd.

When they arrived, we only noticed about 4, maybe 5 people, which again is fine, but they did bring 3 dogs - 2 small and a medium sized one. We have a fee for dogs as the hair and paw prints do require additional attention when cleaning up, but the dog option was never selected by the guests. We didn't make a big stink out of it, in fact, we didn't mention it at all.

The annoying part was that they seemed satisfied, messaged us when they had questions and we answered right away. We clearly indicated on our listing that we only have a Keurig coffee machine for coffee, no regular filtered coffee machine. We also indicated our air fryer, and all the other amenities.

They complained on the amenities because they stated that we didn't have a filter coffee machine - which we never said we did, and that we also didn't have a toaster. We have a perfectly functioning oven, and air fryer to toast whatever you need. They also complained they had to buy more toilet paper and that everything was closed, so they bought it at the convenience store which obviously was expensive.

From what I gather, it was 2 women and 3 men. We left 3 large Costco toilet paper rolls that would likely have been sufficient for the 2 nights they stayed thinking it was enough.

Now we received a lower rating, despite all our previous guests leaving 5 stars, due to the missing toaster, toilet paper and filter coffee machine.

Is that legit? Like, how much toilet paper are you using that you needed more than 3 large rolls over 2 nights? Why complain about amenities that were never indicated as being available? They did use our Keurig along with many pods we had left for the guest convenience, and yet still complained and lowered our score due to this?

Anyone encounter anything similar? Anything we can do to resolve? Airbnb refused to remove the review.

Note: Bloodrock Remains is a series of related, interconnected stories, but each story is a standalone read.



I sat in the day room of my unit at the Utah State Hospital, looking at the others going about their daily routines.  Contrary to popular belief, or at least the belief portrayed in movies, most of the people here were mostly normal.  There were a few who definitely looked crazy, and almost everyone talked to themselves, but I wouldn’t see any of them as crazy if I ran into them at 7-11 or something out there.  Back in the real world.



Normally, I would be over by the big window, looking out at the sun, maybe playing a board game with Jessica.  She was another older teen like me, brownish red hair, and fun to be around.  She even acted like she could be interested in me.  If we were out in the real world, there could be a shot at dating her.  I didn’t want to get too close, though, because allegedly I would be getting released soon.



I looked back out the window at the massive tree out in the grounds in front of my unit, soaking up the late September sun.  Elm?  Oak?  I didn’t know.  Today I was going to talk to my primary psychiatrist about being released.



Back to the real world.



“Tyler, there you are,” a calm woman said from behind me, startling me out of my thoughts.

I jerked, pulling my gaze from the tree outside to look at the woman.



She smiled, making no note about my sudden, jerky motion.  It was commonplace here.



“It’s time to go see Doctor Carrington,” the nurse said.  Or maybe she was an orderly.  I don’t really know what the difference is.



“With a name like Carrington, he has to be official!” I quipped in a commercial announcer voice.



The nurse smiled a little bigger.  “Let’s go, Mr. Ruiz.”



I got up from the thickly upholstered chair I had been sitting in.  I wouldn’t miss the weird pale green color of that thing, that was for sure.



The nurse led me down a couple of sterile hallways, past taped markings on the ground showing us where we weren’t allowed to walk without supervision.  Mostly, we passed other patient rooms, but there was the occasional office and one rather scary looking janitor’s office that always seemed to be open.



I swear, the tiny faucet and drain for the mop bucket was possessed and haunted, and had probably been imported from an Indian burial ground, or something.  As we walked past, a great gurgling sound belched out from the drain, making me flinch.  I hated that damn room.



The nurse, to no surprise, showed no reaction at all to the noise, and led me onward.



She deposited me in a smaller version of the day room.  This one lacked the fluorescent lights of the rest of the building, and had instead gone for sparse ‘normal’ lighting.  Incandescent, I think.  The idea was probably to make the area feel more like a living room and less like the sterile hospital that it was.



There was a group therapy session going on here, and one of the younger psychiatrists was leading.

“Hello, Mr. Tyler,” the psych said.  “Go ahead and have a seat while you’re waiting on Dr. Carrington.”



I noted that he had just been talking with one of the other patients.  Talking at one of the other patients, I should say.



The man was probably in his forties, or maybe late thirties, and I only knew him as Kells, which had to be his last name.  Other patients, orderlies, and nurses, they all just called him Kells.  The guy had a short brown beard that was starting to turn gray in small spots, and hair a couple of inches long that was always messy.  He had blue eyes that felt cold, as if they were actually made of ice.  I had never heard the guy’s voice, because he just… never talked.  There were many rumors about what illness he had been diagnosed with, but no one seemed to know for sure.



“Now, Mr. Martin,” the psych said, returning his attention to Kells.  Apparently Martin was his first name- this particular psych was famous for always saying ‘Mr.’ or ‘Miss’ in front of everyone’s first names.  “If you would just communicate your feelings, we would be able to make some progress, and perhaps some of your privileges would even be returned to you.  You know that if we never make progress, any hope of release is all but non-existent.”



There were six other people sitting on chairs and couches in the loose circle, a couple with foam cups of coffee or water, and none of them seemed exactly thrilled to be here.  Not that I could blame them.



“Ironic, isn’t it?” a voice spoke.  It was coarse, but soft.  Like a guy who had done a lot of smoking, but didn’t see the need to speak above a face to face conversation level.



Holy crap.  Kells had been the one speaking.  I actually got chills.  Entire scary stories had been spun just explaining his years-long silence in this place.



“You can’t even see the fallacy of your statement,” Kells continued in a voice that was calm right down to the level of a psychopathic killer toying with his little mouse of a victim.  “You deprive others of basic rights, refer to those rights as privileges so that you can justify taking them, and then refuse to allow us basic decency unless we prance about like puppets when you pull upon our delicate strings, all the while hoping that we can’t see those strings.  You don’t care about my feelings, and you are incapable of communication.  You instead demand parroting of your rhetoric, dangling the carrot of release and the prize of being given access to uninhibited sunshine and outside air for successfully fitting into your little program.  You don’t care about my feelings, and you don’t want to hear about them, you want me to assure you of your own superiority and my adherence to your script.”



I suspected that Kells was going to continue further, but when he paused for an inhale, the psychiatrist jumped in.



“Now, now, Mr. Martin, those things aren’t true,” the psych managed, with only a little strain in his voice.  “Psychiatrists are here to help, and we do want to know your story so that we can understand you.”



“I wasn’t speaking about psychiatrists,” Kells snapped, still not raising his voice, but speaking quicker and with more force.  “I was speaking about you.  Most psychiatrists got into their work because they truly wanted to help others.  I would imagine that most of them still do want to help.  I am pointing out the flaws in your thinking- you want me to say the things that you want me to say, and you even overtly threatened to deny me freedom permanently until I decide to play your little game.”



“I did no such thing,” the psych said, stammering now.



“You did.  You told me that while I refused to communicate my feelings, any hope of release is essentially non-existent.  But you don’t want my feelings or my communication, because communication is two-way, and any real transfer of meaningful information involves a close look at not just myself, but at you, and the last thing you want, my friend,” Kells practically snarled the word friend, showing most of his teeth, “is for me to give you information about yourself.”



“I don’t have anything to hide,” the psych managed.  Sweat actually broke out on his forehead.  The other six people here were squirming in their seats, but most looked like they were trying hard to stifle a smile.



I could totally relate to that.  Sure, I agreed that most psychs probably wanted to help people, but in this place… I hadn’t seen any real help yet.  It probably existed.  People did get released from this hospital on a semi-regular basis, it wasn’t an island of no hope.  But this guy, and most of the psychs that I had dealt with… I think Kells had a point.  A damn good one.



“You have everything to hide,” Kells snapped.  His voice rose ever so slightly in volume, but he was far from shouting.  “The real tragedy here isn’t me, nor is it your ineptitude,” Kells continued.  “It is the fact that you are training these people, who have been deemed by the State of Utah as being emotionally and mentally in need of help, to better wear a mask.  You aren’t seeking truth, you aren’t seeking treatment, you are simply training these people that if they can manage to adjust their mask the right way, and recite the right lines, they might win that part on the great stage of life.  They might be rewarded with freedom and release.”



“This isn’t helping,” the psych stammered.  Now he was squirming even worse than the others.



“Of course it isn’t,” Kells responded, still completely calm and in control.  “Because you asked me for my feelings, and I gave them to you.  You asked for communication, and I gave it to you.  You are so utterly out of touch with reality, that when you encounter it, you are paralyzed because it isn’t part of the script.  You say that expressing feelings and communicating is good, but that isn’t what you mean.  You don’t want truth.  You are sheltered as far from truth as you can muster, while still being able to operate in the real world of freedom.”



Kells fell silent.



The psych opened his mouth and closed it, then again, as if he were trying hard to find something to say.



“Ironic, isn’t it?”  Kells asked, mirroring his first question.  “You belong here every bit as much as most of us do, and you’re worse than some, because you wield your power as a tool, threatening the freedom of others until they submit to your control and regurgitate the rhetoric you forcefeed them.  I wonder, Mr. Rich, why do you seek control?  What is it about your life that makes you feel totally powerless that leads you to do what you do?”



“My life is great, thank you,” the psych answered, voice outright shaking.  “I am led to help others because I like to help.”



“And you lie,” Kells said.  “You hide your emotions, while demanding that we share ours, but only the ones that agree with your textbook.  You belong here, Rich.  You are more one of us than you realize.”



The psychiatrist, Rich, I guess, couldn’t answer, but both his eyes were glazed.



A door opened to the left of the group.  It was Carrington’s office.



“Tyler Ruiz?” he asked, popping his head out of the door.



I stood up.



“Ah, good to see you again, Tyler,” the doctor said, disappearing back into his office.



I followed inside, closing his office door behind me.  Group therapy sucked.  Solo therapy sucked.  But it was rare to see something like that, for someone to speak their mind plainly, and to make so damn much sense.



I did believe that help existed here, and presumably in every other mental hospital, too.  But no matter where you go, in which part of the system you may be in, I suspected that Kells might have a point.



“Please, Tyler, have a seat,” Dr. Carrington said, waving at the two comfortable chairs in front of his large mahogany desk.



He wore a white coat that I would call a lab coat over his ever-present sweater. He even wore a sweater through all of summer, always with a tie.  Today it was a brown sweater with stripes of red and orange, very fall-like.  His tie was a plain navy blue, and was tucked into the sweater.  The lab coat, coupled with his wire frame glasses, made him look more like a mad scientist in a scary movie than a professional psychotherapist.  Psychiatrist.  Whatever he was.



“As you know, you are up for review,” Carrington said, lowering his head to look at me over the rim of his glasses with his lighter blue eyes.  His thinning brown hair was kept short.



“We would like to release you,” Dr. Carrington continued, “but of course, there is the matter of your feelings about that rather nasty business with your father.”



Kells immediately jumped into my head, with his speech about parroting the script.



“Everyone has a bad childhood,” I said, dropping my eyes from his penetrating gaze.  His desk really was magnificent.  “I think it’ll probably always hurt, but I also think that the only way to really get over it, or to recover from it, I guess, is to move on.”



I glanced back up to see that his gaze hadn’t shifted in the slightest, and he was sitting quietly.

“Moving forward in a constructive way seems like the best thing to do to heal,” I said, again thinking about Kells.  Was I parroting the right lines?  Did my mask fit my face just right?



I seriously doubted that I ran any risk of growing up to be a serial killer or anything, and really, I had heard so many stories from friends in both of the junior high schools I had gone to and the one high school that I sort of believed that line I had given about everyone having a crappy childhood.  A few people seemed to be ‘normal’ and actually enjoyed going home after school, but enough people talked enough trash about their own lives that I wondered how ‘real’ those normal people were.



I endured his stare for longer than was comfortable, but I kept remembering Kells.  Wear the mask, parrot the lines.  Don’t volunteer information, that seemed like a good thing to add to the list of survival skills.



After several seconds more, Dr. Carrington finally sat back in his chair and typed away at his keyboard, looking at one of the two monitors on the side of his desk.



“The board feels that you have made a lot of progress in processing your negative emotions,” the doc said, “and it seems as though your tests are coming back within normal, as well.  I don’t think I would feel bad about releasing you.”



He stopped typing and lowered his head to peer at me over the rims of his glasses again.  “I don’t need to remind you, however, that if you experience relapses, you will need to return to outpatient counseling, and if you deteriorate beyond that, you will be subject to being readmitted to inpatient status, where we can monitor your case in a safe environment.”



Safe.  That word seemed to have new meanings to me now that it had growing up.  Multiple meanings.  None of them what I originally thought the word meant.



“I understand,” I said.  My voice was surprisingly neutral.  I thought that I might have to fight to sound like I wasn’t being too excited about it, but instead I just sounded… calm.



“You may go back to your room, Mr. Ruiz,” Dr. Carrington said.  “I will forward the recommendation for release.  You will probably get to go home in the morning, since your mother is here in Provo.  Worst case, you’ll be back to the harshness of reality the day after tomorrow.”



Dr. Carrington’s smile told me that he had been trying to be funny with the ‘harshness of reality’ statement, and I smiled back.



“And I hear the harshness only gets worse when I get out of high school next summer, and I have to worry about still more real things like jobs and paying rent,” I said.



Dr. Carrington laughed, and it sounded genuine.  “Yeah, be sure to let me know if you need a prescription for something when you encounter that level of reality,” he said, sounding like he was probably joking.  Probably.  “Go ahead and go, and hopefully we won’t see each other again.”



I got up and left his office.  The group therapy was still in session, but Kells was missing now.  I couldn’t help but wonder what had happened to him, and why he was gone while the rest of them were still there, and the poor psych leading the group still looked to be on the verge of tears.

\*\*\*\*\*



I always thought that the meeting they have at the end there is just an excuse to give you a chance to screw up.  My mother showed up to get me just two hours after I talked with Carrington, all but confirming that my release had already been approved, suggesting that giving me that one last chance to screw up was probably a good guess.



We moved out of Utah after that, to be away from the past, away from…everything.  My mom picked a place in Colorado because she had been able to land a job in a phone interview, and only a few days after my release, we were driving past the green sign announcing that we were entering Bloodrock Ridge, Colorado, population 35,416.

I couldn't decide for sure if it looked like a small city or a large town as we drove down into the mountain valley that occupied the town.



Whatever it was, it wouldn't get much bigger. It was limited in size by the bowl shaped valley with three mountains in close proximity.



“Looks nice,” my mom said.



“Yeah,” I agreed.  “Let's hope that it really is.”



We arrived on a Tuesday, our SUV stuffed to the gills with everything we still owned after that ‘nasty business’ with my father, as Carrington would have said.  Not having a full moving truck to unload made it quick, and I had my stuff unpacked and set up in my room and had helped my mom get stuff unpacked and settled in the kitchen and living room before dinner.



I was proud of my mom.  After the fallout from my dad, she had done remarkably well pulling herself together.  I suspected that she might not be as stable on the inside, but it was nothing short of miraculous that she was keeping it together and that she had been able to get us moved a full state away from…the past.



The following morning she took me to Bloodrock Ridge Highschool and got me registered.



Thankfully I missed almost all of the first period, even though classes were really long here.  The counselor who helped me pick out classes told me that there were four classes a day, but eight total, and the school days went back and forth between ‘A’ day and ‘B’ day, but ultimately I didn't care.  I just wanted to survive this, graduate, and maybe find a girlfriend.



My mom spared me the kiss goodbye, and left to go to work, and I wandered slowly through the halls to familiarize myself with where things were.  I had made it nearly to my second period class when I heard a series of four bong noises played over the PA system, and kids began pouring out of classrooms.  Apparently the bonging is what served as a bell here.



I watched the flow of teenagers.  Bloodrock Ridge seemed to be about 85% white with an even mix of black, Hispanic, Asian, and Islanders making up the rest.  It was a little more diverse than my last school had been, and I didn't see any evidence of racial tension yet, which was good.



I did catch something that made my pulse rise a little, though.  One tough looking guy was leaning on a locker next to a smaller attractive girl swapping out books in her own locker.  She looked none too pleased by his attention.



“Whatcha doin tonight, Elizabeth?” the guy asked.  “Me?  You know it should be me.”



Stuffing her new book into her backpack, she slammed her locker.  “You'd have better luck with a girl who liked you, Tony,” she said, a touch of venom in her voice.  “Or maybe one who at least considered you human.  Get away from me.”



She pushed past him, and two other guys made the scandalous ‘ooohh’ sound, causing him to blush slightly.



“I don't want all the girls that are after me,” he called out after her.  “Only you, Elizabeth!”



Obsession was never good.



“What are you looking at?” Tony asked me as he and his two buddies moved past me.  He rammed my shoulder with his.



Brushing off the encounter, I moved into my second period class to learn all about the Byzantine empire in modern world history.  Joy. 

\*\*\*\*\*



The rest of the first day of school and most of the second turned out to be alright, and I suspected that this was going to be a good school.  I almost regretted only getting to be here for a single year.  At my previous school, incidents like Tony and Elizabeth happened a few times a day, they were entirely unavoidable.  But they seemed far more rare here, and combined with a lack of racial tension, and a general overall positive enthusiasm of the students as a whole, I was beginning to like it.



The second day I was feeling a little more relaxed, and decided I could wear my favorite jeans, which had a few holes in them, and a Megadeth tour shirt from ‘89.  Other students had worn ragged jeans without being yelled at, so I figured it would be okay.



Fourth period on that second day was geometry.  This would be an easy class for me.  I had been in it in my previous school, and just hadn't finished it.



I sat in front of a smaller boy who I had seen in one other class but didn't know his name.  But then Tony came into the class and sat a couple of desks to my right.



I had no idea if he recognized me or not, but probably not.  I made a point of not looking at him, but a question rose.  What should I do?  Bullying didn't seem to be as prevalent here as it had been in my last school, but I sure didn't want to have to deal with it at all, if I could avoid it.

Turning around, I made the choice to take the low road.



I knocked the smaller boy's geometry book and his notebook on the floor.



From the corner of my eye, I saw Tony smirk and then pull out his own book.



The boy behind me looked annoyed, very understandably, and picked his book back up.



The teacher's name was Mr. Peterson, and he had the only old school chalk board that I had seen so far in this school.  All my other classes had white boards.  When he wrote on the board, he would erase it by making parallel lines all across the board.  At first, I figured it was a compulsive thing, but then as he was making parallel lines and then intersecting them with a third line for a problem, I realized that he erased in parallel lines because it made it easier for him to put up more accurate triangles and such.  Smart.



At the end of class, just after the bell rang, I turned around in an exaggerated way, knocking the boy’s book on the floor again.



This time, Tony shook his head as he chuckled, and strode out of the class.



“Sorry, dude,” I told the guy as students filed out of the classroom, off to enjoy their evenings of freedom.



We were down to just three students left in the class now.  Me, the smaller boy, and an attractive brunette with light blue eyes.



“I don't care what your home life is like, man, leave me alone,” the boy burst out.



I had intended to apologize for real, and to explain myself.



“Problem, Mr. Brenner?” Mr. Peterson asked.



Something flared in me.  Hearing an adult use the formal last name of a teen put me immediately back in the State Hospital.



“No, I think Tyler here just needs to work through some home life issues.  I'm sure there won't be problems,” the boy said.  I had no idea he knew my name.



He clutched his math book and notebook in his hands and made his way out of class.



“Have a good day, Kyle!” the attractive brunette called out to him.



“Mr. Ruiz?” Mr. Peterson asked.



“Tyler,” I corrected him.  Hearing my last name was grating on me, reminding me too heavily of a time that I wanted very much to delete from active memory.



“And will we be having trouble from you, Mr. Ruiz?” Mr. Peterson asked.



“Whatever, man, I have a bus to catch,” I said, grabbing my book and heading for the door.  I had never suffered from anxiety until my dad, and the State Hospital, but the last names were triggering anxiety worse than Tony had.



Not two steps into the hall, I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I turned to see the attractive girl from the back of the class.



“Hi, Tyler, I'm Joanna,” she said, holding out her hand.



I stared at her hand for a moment.  Choosing the low road had been grating, the experience with Tony that led to that choice had been grating, and Mr. Peterson's insistent use of students’ last names had been the figurative icing on the cake.  But with some effort, I managed to contain myself.



“Hi,” I managed, shaking her hand.



“New to Bloodrock Ridge, eh?” she asked.



I snorted.  “Is it that obvious?”



“Bullies don't last long here,” Joanna said with what I could only describe as a dark grin.



“Why's that?” I asked, arching an eyebrow.  If that was true, maybe Tony was also new or fairly new here.



“Bullies everywhere are bullies because they are trying to mask their fear of… fill in the blank,” Joanna said.  “And in most cases, it's coupled with a sense of being totally out of control.  Bullying gives them that sense of control.  People here are quick to point that out to bullies, which makes most of them stop because it only calls attention to their inadequacies.”



Much of that sounded very much like she was either trying out for a position as an orderly at the State Hospital, or maybe that she was best friends with Kells.  Either way, it stung.



I opened my mouth to explain in great detail that while she probably wasn't wrong, I was no bully, but she cut me off.



“Justify it any way you like,” she said, “but ultimately, even if you're trying to prove you're brave to keep others from targeting you in a new school, picking on someone smaller than you doesn't make you look brave, it exposes you as being weak.  You want to be brave?  Go spend the night at the abandoned hospital.  While you're there, call out to Patient 432, and tell her it's time.  Make sure you record it so that you have evidence, because no one will believe you.  But if you ask me, I would recommend that you don't do it.”



I was no stranger to psychological tricks.  Even before my stay at the Utah State Hospital, I had been manipulated, and her last line about not recommending it after she just got done recommending it was class A manipulation.



“Why won't they believe me?” I asked.



“Because everyone who does it dies,” Joanna said, still smiling darkly.  “Which is why I would personally suggest that you don't do it.  But I also suggest that you don't create a bully image, because bullies here die.”



Although I could see right through her manipulation, I had no reason to believe that this hospital might actually be haunted.  I had survived being in a State Hospital with no real hauntings, although I did certainly suspect that damnable janitor’s closet.  Mental hospitals were easy nightmare fodder, abandoned ones even more so. Just add a couple of shadows and a rat scurrying through a leaf pile a few rooms away, and you could see someone die from fright without the need for a murderous ghost.



I smirked in spite of myself.  “Where is this hospital?”



“Tell you what,” Joanna offered.  “You go home and think it through.  Maybe ask around today and tomorrow.  When you discover that everyone who does it dies, maybe you'll get smart and not die yourself.  I'm the only one who knows that you've heard the legend now, so you won't even lose face by changing your mind about it.  If you still want to go off and die, I'll tell you where it is tomorrow.  But it doesn't look like a hospital, because it started life as a bunk house for coal miners, and there are several buildings that look the same.”",1,1768269992.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

You can either reply here or not at all.

Up to 2 unsolicited DMs so far.

I, 30f, have been working mostly seasonal positions since I was 17. Having a built in end date is nice, but the pay is *really* bad with my regular employer. They get some sort of exemption credits because they provide housing and food, so most seasonal positions come out as below my state's minimum wage. I worked for them for roughly 49 weeks out of 2025 and after their deduction my gross income was only $18k. 

There's an H&R Block in the next town over that's got a seasonal receptionist opening. I know it's still a seasonal position, but since they don't subtract for food and housing the pay will be higher. And I want to start building experience in office positions so I can get out of the kitchen-retail cycle.

My plan is to focus on the team cooperation, time management, and the fast passed environment.

- camp kitchen. ""Baker"" over the summer 2024 and 2025, ""food service staff"" in the off season. Dishwasher once back in 2017. Kitchen regularly feeds 300 people each meal during the summer, up to 600+ in our busiest weeks.
- Family Dollar cashier
- server, cashier, and ice cream maker at local diner, left to follow opportunity that didn't pan out in the end
- gas station cashier
- camp janitorial type position that has since been absorbed into other departments
- 2 months housekeeping at same camp
- dietary aide at local long term care facility, ended badly due to a false accusation ""he said / she said"" situation 
- camp's ""arts and crafts"" center
- camp's retail store, made the list of *top 100 outdoor retailers* in 2015

Stuff I'm already leaving off:
- short stint bagging house roasted coffee blends for a shop that closed not long after laying me off
- ""coffee shop"" that was badly mismanaged, cut my hours in half, terminated me over text with no warning or reason, and ended in a dumpster fire on Facebook between the property owner and the operator. No point in bringing that drama to the party.
- summer job in high school at local ice cream shop that closed years ago
- 3 month internship thing through DVR at the library in the next town over 
- 3 months at local title insurance company that went bad when one of the other women started bullying and lying about me. Supervisor told me to my face that she would always believe this person over anyone else because they had worked together for so long.

I just picked up a De’Longhi Classic along with a MiiCoffee D54 grinder. Starting small while I learn the basics.

Probably a dumb question, but how do you recommend transferring ground coffee into the portafilter cleanly? I’m having a hard time without grounds going everywhere.

I’ve tried: •	Using the plastic dosing cup that came with the D54 and pouring into the portafilter (messy) •	Holding the cup under the portafilter and vice versa (doesn’t fit cleanly) •	Using a 51mm portafilter funnel directly under the grinder, but it seemed to clog or sit too close and made things worse

Nothing feels clean or consistent so far, especially when it comes time to tamp.

For reference: •	51mm portafilter •	Dosing ~18g (assuming that’s standard)

Grind is currently dialed in around 18 on the D54. I originally tried 12, but it was way too fine and barely pulled at all.

What now?","I am someone who loves love and yearns for that Great Big Romance. I am not sure I have that with my current partner. We have been together for seven months.

My current partner is someone who washes my water bottle when I get home because he knows I’ll never get around to it and he doesn’t want it to get moldy. He is someone who helps me advocate for myself in important situations. He is someone who goes over my emails before I hit send to make sure I’m putting my best foot forward. He’s someone who only buys milk because I take it in my coffee. He is someone who shows up for me at my lowest moments.

My current partner is also someone who has made me feel awful on several occasions. He is someone who has repeatedly pointed out all of my deficiencies from everything between failing to remember a plan we made, to not knowing how to cut an onion, to allegedly not dressing appropriately for the weather. He is someone who has called me “immature” and someone who has described my so-called negative mindset (I struggle with my mental health) as “poison” and “toxic”. He makes me feel like a burden. I do not know why he is with me. It feels like he is only with me because when he decides to commit to something, he really commits to it. He is someone who has apologized for using these words and making me feel this way. He is someone who said he can be trained. My current partner is not someone who gets up from the couch to hug me goodbye when I leave his apartment. 

My current partner is a pragmatist. I am a hopeless romantic.

I think back to my last two Great Big Romances. I talked about them to my friends with a level of excitement with which I have never spoken to my friends about my current partner. I had that Head Over Heels feeling. Embraces felt like warmth and home. It felt like we were lovebirds against the world. I can’t say I have that with my current partner.

It seems I have convinced myself that I have two choices: (1) stay with my current partner which would indicate choosing commitment and pragmatism, or (2) leave him to make room for that next Great Big Romance. 

TL;DR: I’m in a stable, caring relationship with a pragmatic older partner who often makes me feel criticized, and I’m struggling to decide whether choosing commitment means letting go of my longing for a Great Big Romance, or whether this current relationship is simply wrong for me.",0,1768269653.0,relationship_advice,36,0.5,False
1qbek0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1qbek0c/aio_for_raising_my_hand_on_my_bf_coz_hes_too/,AIO for raising my hand on my bf coz he's too gentle and polite?,"Hey. I'm 24f and my bf is 21m. For background, I come from a broken up family where my mom does drugs and dad has remarried. My bf comes from a asian family who moved here years ago but my bf used to stay with his grandpa in his own country and came here 5 years ago after his death.

His family lives in neighborhood and they're pretty well off. He was brought up in a very kind and gentle environment. His grandparents are the best people out there who were polite and loving their whole life and that reflects in his behavior and personality too.

His english is still a bit offshore, it's adorable and really really endearing when he looks for words to describe his feelings but ends up saying those in the wrong pronunciation. He's the prettiest thing ever...like really really pretty and absolutely charming.

We met through community work and I immediately wanted to know him more. Luckily we hit off good and I asked him out 3 months later. It's been 2 years now and we're still together. And mind you, he doesnt have many friends coz of communication skills and he's kind of an introvert too.

Thing is....he's too polite and gentle. Almost like a pushover.  He's still studying but I got myself a job now so whenever I've some extra work, I tell him to do it for me and he does it without another thought. Whenever I ask for money when I run low, he gives it with a smile. Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I snap at him for asking if everything's alright. I snap at his mispronunciation, his mistakes with Grammer and sentences even though those arent even noticeable. I once threw a coffee down the drain coz I was pissed about my sister and then he messed up my coffee by trying to make me try his 'back home' version of coffee.

Even for that he apologised later saying he shouldn't have pushed me for something I didnt want to do.

I hate it when people take a second look at him when we're out. He's pretty I know but he's mine right? And with how polite he is, he smiles at them and greets them nicely, unknowingly raising their hopes to approach him even more. 

These past few weeks, he's been learning crocheting to control his anxiety and he makes me the sweetest things like Keychains, bracelets and covers for my bottle. 

What made me hit him is..I know its really fcked up but I've been stressed immensely about my work place. The employees are judgemental and higher ups are too annoying so I'm pissed off most of the time of the day.

And when I come home, he immediately comes to my place and YAPS about his day and asks for mine, even brings me various new crochet stuff and mind you my desk and cupboard are now full of those little pretty things. I've started to get annoyed at those and want to tell him to stop but instead of telling him..Last night I just snapped and threw what he got me (a bow and cherry hairclip) out the window.

He was hurt and expressed it but chose the wrong word and that just..pissed me off more so I shouted at him to shut the hell up. He was shocked, his face that I love so much had this..idk really confused and hurt look.

He stood up and gathered his stuff, apologised for coming but me being already worked up, I asked him where the hell was he going and he needs to sit his ass down until I calm down. 
I think he felt unsafe and kept muttering about now being not the time to talk and walked towards the door.

I dont know what came over me but I just yanked his hair and told him to sit on the couch and keep his mouth shut. He was scared, I saw the fear and idk..I think..I think I fed on it and snapped at him to sit and keep his mouth shut until I tell him to speak.

But he did open his mouth to say I was scaring him and he didn't feel good and I just, I dont know what happened but my anger flew off and I ended up slapping him while shouting at him to shut the hell up. Good thing...he pushed me off and ran away from me and my place.

I calmed down after an hour and two, realised what I did and how I treated him just for being loving and caring towards me. I went insane after hours and kept bombarding him with texts but he hasn't replied to any. I've tried calling but each goes to VM.

I know I'm the a-hole here but I just wanna ask how do I fix it? Is there any chance to get him to forgive me? Coz i really really love him and I dont wanna let him go.",0,1768269626.0,AIO,67,0.14,False

1qbei6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/darkforum/comments/1qbei6r/goatwitch/,Goatwitch,"She said her name was Maab. He didn't believe her. Until the end. 

Earliest morning. Still dark. The far off horizon hadn't yet birthed the sun. She'd said it must be so. 

He followed her, the hunched over black robed and hooded goblin shape that had only the semblance of a woman's old and weathered voice with which to perhaps mark her as human. 

She was not one of God's children. 

He followed her into the graveyard. So that they might fulfill the rite. 

And pull one back. 

She said it could be done. The thing that might be a woman that called itself Maab. And though it was vile blasphemy to do so, Wyckoff prayed that the foul shape in black was able to actually perform the ebon necromantic arts. 

Please. God forgive me. Please. 

I just want her back. Please just give her back to me. 

Maab-thing had croaked orders to him before they'd departed the village proper. Instructions. And materials needed. 

The place, the wound in time and nature, it must drink…

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition. 

He didn't like to look at her but he needed her so he kept behind her, the witch-woman Maab and he followed her to the pulling place. Time womb. 

Hellmouth. 

Oh God… why did I ever put you in this place…? Whatever compelled me to put you in the ground here… why did I leave you in this rotting dark place…? 

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

There’s a lot of overconfidence without real exposure, constant posturing, inconsideration for others, and people overly inflating their egos over things that don’t really hold up outside this bubble. Add in a heavy dose of performative religiosity, and it often feels more like virtue signaling than genuine practice.
Conversations tend to feel loud, scripted, and surface-level, like people are playing roles instead of being real or curious. Even family dynamics can feel frozen in time, like personal growth doesn’t register unless it fits an expected mold.
I’m not trying to put anyone down or say I’m better than anyone — I just feel misaligned. Being back makes normal things like the gym, coffee shops, or casual conversations feel tense and inauthentic instead of relaxed and human.
Curious if this is just what happens when you leave and come back, or if others here feel it too — and if you’ve found spaces around here that feel more grounded and real.",0,1768269188.0,Dearborn,6,0.29,False
1qbecpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1qbecpi/i_raised_my_hand_on_my_bf_coz_hes_too_gentle_and/,I raised my hand on my bf coz he's too gentle and polite?,"Hey. I'm 24f and my bf is 21m. For background, I come from a broken up family where my mom does drugs and dad has remarried. My bf comes from a asian family who moved here years ago but my bf used to stay with his grandpa in his own country and came here 5 years ago after his death.

His family lives in neighborhood and they're pretty well off. He was brought up in a very kind and gentle environment. His grandparents are the best people out there who were polite and loving their whole life and that reflects in his behavior and personality too.

His english is still a bit offshore, it's adorable and really really endearing when he looks for words to describe his feelings but ends up saying those in the wrong pronunciation. He's the prettiest thing ever...like really really pretty and absolutely charming.

We met through community work and I immediately wanted to know him more. Luckily we hit off good and I asked him out 3 months later. It's been 2 years now and we're still together. And mind you, he doesnt have many friends coz of communication skills and he's kind of an introvert too.

Thing is....he's too polite and gentle. Almost like a pushover.  He's still studying but I got myself a job now so whenever I've some extra work, I tell him to do it for me and he does it without another thought. Whenever I ask for money when I run low, he gives it with a smile. Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I snap at him for asking if everything's alright. I snap at his mispronunciation, his mistakes with Grammer and sentences even though those arent even noticeable. I once threw a coffee down the drain coz I was pissed about my sister and then he messed up my coffee by trying to make me try his 'back home' version of coffee.

Even for that he apologised later saying he shouldn't have pushed me for something I didnt want to do.

I hate it when people take a second look at him when we're out. He's pretty I know but he's mine right? And with how polite he is, he smiles at them and greets them nicely, unknowingly raising their hopes to approach him even more. 

These past few weeks, he's been learning crocheting to control his anxiety and he makes me the sweetest things like Keychains, bracelets and covers for my bottle. 

What made me hit him is..I know its really fcked up but I've been stressed immensely about my work place. The employees are judgemental and higher ups are too annoying so I'm pissed off most of the time of the day.

And when I come home, he immediately comes to my place and YAPS about his day and asks for mine, even brings me various new crochet stuff and mind you my desk and cupboard are now full of those little pretty things. I've started to get annoyed at those and want to tell him to stop but instead of telling him..Last night I just snapped and threw what he got me (a bow and cherry hairclip) out the window.

He was hurt and expressed it but chose the wrong word and that just..pissed me off more so I shouted at him to shut the hell up. He was shocked, his face that I love so much had this..idk really confused and hurt look.

He stood up and gathered his stuff, apologised for coming but me being already worked up, I asked him where the hell was he going and he needs to sit his ass down until I calm down. 
I think he felt unsafe and kept muttering about now being not the time to talk and walked towards the door.

I dont know what came over me but I just yanked his hair and told him to sit on the couch and keep his mouth shut. He was scared, I saw the fear and idk..I think..I think I fed on it and snapped at him to sit and keep his mouth shut until I tell him to speak.

But he did open his mouth to say I was scaring him and he didn't feel good and I just, I dont know what happened but my anger flew off and I ended up slapping him while shouting at him to shut the hell up. Good thing...he pushed me off and ran away from me and my place.

I calmed down after an hour and two, realised what I did and how I treated him just for being loving and caring towards me. I went insane after hours and kept bombarding him with texts but he hasn't replied to any. I've tried calling but each goes to VM.

I know I'm the a-hole here but I just wanna ask how do I fix it? Is there any chance to get him to forgive me? Coz i really really love him and I dont wanna let him go.",0,1768269094.0,WhatShouldIDo,51,0.24,False

**What:** Te Araroa Trail, South Island NZ. Ships Cove to Boyle SOBO

**When:** 1st-20th December 2025

**Distance:** \~380km hiked, \~20km of roads skipped

**Weather:** Excellent for first 2 weeks, then deteriorated massively. Very cold (see Waiau pass section), and persistent rain. Flooded out multiple sections in mid-south island by end of december.

**Gear:** Lighterpack - [https://lighterpack.com/r/j98gyz](https://lighterpack.com/r/j98gyz)

Gear Notes:

* Zero-G podgies were extremely useful. Found when it rained it was extremely cold rain. Also saved my hands from freezing on Waiau Pass
* DIY camera cover from a lightweight dry bag was excellent
* Umbrella was great for a few sections, and would be even better if I was able to continue south
* On the lighter end of people I met, only saw one true ultralighter

# Trip Report

*Note: I'm rounding the distance/elevation/time figures*

**Pre Trip**

I flew into Wellington to start the trail. Did some shopping around Wellington for groceries (the new world in Thorndon has more options than anything in Picton), gas, lighters and bug spray. Then I caught the Interislander Ferry to Picton.

In Picton I did some last shopping at the fresh choice supermarket then organised all my food parcels in my motel room. I posted all parcels from the NZ post inside fresh choice, a couple notes on this:

* Significantly cheaper to post from south island than north
* Staff are all over TA walkers posting parcels and are extremely helpful
* NZ post is literally a counter in the supermarket, with more limited hours than the supermarket (opens at 9am, weekdays only).
* Heaps of boxes available

**Section 1 - Ships Cove to Pelorus Bridge (Queen Charlotte Track and Link Pathway)**

*Day 1 (6km, +/- 250m, 90mins)* \- Caught the water taxi to Ships Cove, then an easy walk to the camp at Schoolhouse Bay. Great spot, absolutely brazen Wekas. Those things are way braver than currawongs, but don't break stuff for love of the game like Keas.

[Camp at Schoolhouse Bay](https://preview.redd.it/ghcs7slri0dg1.png?width=1436&format=png&auto=webp&s=31fcd02a9820ab6048b1bb898aa1a1837e3d8b10)

*Day 2 (25km, +/- 700m, 8.5h) -* First full day. Stopped at Resolution Bay early for an excellent coffee. Started walking with a couple other hikers from about lunchtime for the rest of the section. Great views of the sounds all day, ending at Camp Bay for the night.

[Resolution bay Jetty](https://preview.redd.it/jwmfm6mdk0dg1.png?width=1436&format=png&auto=webp&s=19587262cea83a0ccb0dd195abe8402ea69aa0a0)

*Day 3 (26km, +/- 1000m, 8h) -* Biggest day on the QCT in awful weather. Very cold driving rain all day led us to push all the way to Cowshed Bay to avoid exposed camping at Black Rock Campsite.

*Day 4 (20km, +/- 780m, 6.5h)* \- Significant improvement in weather. Had an early coffee at Portage (right near the campsite) before continuing on to Davies Bay for the night. Extremely nice camping available on the water here  with views of the sounds. Field out the back has no views and many goats.

[View from tent at Davies Bay](https://preview.redd.it/8e7axo8ft0dg1.png?width=1705&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e665bc17df11c134c6bfb450931ec0bfe4831a5)

*Day 5 (7.5km, +/- 100m, 2h) -* Rest nearo today. Stayed at the Smiths Farm Holiday Park in linkwater. Nice enough but I later found out that the pub down the road will let you camp if you buy a meal. Absolutely would have done that in hindsight as there was literally no food available in Anakiwa or Linkwater, apart from the pub.

*Day 6 (16km, +/- 250m, 4h) -* Walked the Link Pathway to Havelock. In the scenic reserve outside havelock it was nice, but otherwise pretty boring road walking. Once I reached Havelock I stocked up in the 4 square (which had great options for a resupply), then caught the intercity bus to skip the \~20km road walk to Pelorus Bridge Campground. Stayed the night here and collected my first resupply box.

**Section 2 - Richmond Ranges (Pelorus River Track and Richmond Range Alpine Track)**

*Day 7 (25km, +1500m,-1000m, 10h)* \- Got an early start to begin the road walk (I think its about 15km) to the Pelorus River Trailhead. Got very lucky and was able to hitch 10km of this when a walker getting dropped off by car ferried anyone who wanted it down the road. From the start of the track walked to Captains Creek Hut, which lived up to the reputation of ""worst sandflies on the TA. Would highly recommend staying at Middy Hut instead if you walk the whole road - much nicer. First hard push of the trail on the \~800m climb up to Rocks Hut for the night. One of the best huts on the trail. Heaps of space, flushing toilet, spectacular views.

[View from the deck at Rocks Hut](https://preview.redd.it/wc23mdhkt0dg1.png?width=1705&format=png&auto=webp&s=f14593935c178f7177317a55366d59ff9e4ad9de)

*Day 8 (23km, +1500m, -1000m, 10h) -* Big push today to complete the Pelorus River track. Right after the hut get your first small taste of alpine tops before dropping down to the river near Browning Hut. Strongly recommend the high water route to Hackett Hut, regardless of weather, due to the dangerous condition of the low water route. Joined up with another hiker at Hackett Hut, before a massive 900m climb to Starveall Hut. Favourite hut on the hike easily. Incredible location.

[Starveall Hut](https://preview.redd.it/bs7qa8nrt0dg1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5a08c6c680a2f9a20d37c6c63e7bfa25677e3d6)

*Day 9 (15.5km, +/-1200m, 7h) -* Spectacular day spent entirely on the tops. Relatively quick to reach Slaty Hut before following high ridges with expansive views on the way to Old Man Hut. No water between Slaty and Old Man Hut (apart from an unreliable rain barrell), so you may need to descend to Old Man for water if trying to do the Rintouls same day. By group agreement we stopped at Old Man Hut, as we were too fatigued to safely cross the Rintouls that afternoon. From Old Man Hut that night we witnessed a helicopter rescue off Little Rintoul. We later found out (from the intentions books) that a hiker we met had fallen, dislocated his jaw and concussed himself, and was helicoptered out to Nelson. He was a SAR worker, which shows it can happen to anyone.

[Views of the Rintouls on Day 9](https://preview.redd.it/j31epc6xt0dg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=319faae998e59c0bcf9a6a55a79d4262d53e96eb)

*Day 10 (16.5km, +/- 1500m, 9h)* \- Highlight of the Richmond Range crossing over the Rintouls. Started with a straightforward climb to the top of Little Rintoul before the dangerous technical descent to the saddle. Genuinely <1km/h terrain, being extremely careful to not fall or push rocks onto others. Climbed up Mt Rintoul on a combination rock and scree slope to spectacular views of Nelson. Dropped down a very loose and steep scree slope to Rintoul Hut (another great hut), before pushing on along the ridge to Tarn Hut for the night.

*Day 11 (16.5km, +/- 1100m, 8h) -* Continued on from Tarn Hut to reach mid Wairoa Hut relatively quickly. The following section following the river to Top Wairoa was unexpectedly a massive highlight. Incredible scenery following and frequently crossing the river. Absolute goat track sidling the river would definetly have been more dangerous than the rintouls in poor weather. Ended the day at top Wairoa Hut.

[Wairoa River](https://preview.redd.it/fjitidkbu0dg1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=c94e3ec7de01d4af9a205b4c86c333b5088b9eea)

*Day 12 (19.5km, +/- 1500m, 9h) -* Steep climb up to a saddle first thing, where the landscape sharply changes to the ""red hills"" section of the TA. Birch forest all but vanishes, replaced by Mars like landscape for next couple of days. Some dramatic crossings of scree slopes on the tops, however not particularly dangerous. Hard work in sunny, sheltered valleys. Ended the day at Porters Creek Hut.

[View from Hunters Hut](https://preview.redd.it/jqgiyfufu0dg1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5e7dc1c82a8646c4c29a59d128fd3349497f83)

*Day 13 (26km, +1400m, -1600m, 9h) -* Rolling valleys and hills to reach Red Hills Hut. This is followed by walking uphill on a mountain bike track (be careful on weekends), then down a farm track to Tophouse Road. Great views of the Valley next to the range. Managed to hitch the 8km Road walk to St Arnaud

*Day 14 (0km) -* Much needed zero in St Arnaud - lovely little town.

**Section 3 - Waiau Pass (Travers Sabine Circuit combined with St James Walkway)**

*Day 15 (32km, +1100m, -450m, 10.5h)-* Massive first push into Nelson Lakes National Park, both to aim for a weather window for Waiau Pass and to get to Upper Travers Hut (everyone I met that day gave me the absolutely correct recommendation that it is the best trail in the NP). Start with a beautiful walk around the edge of the lake, followed by a series of meadows and forests with spectacular glimpses of the mountains ahead. Stayed at the excellent Upper Travers Hut.

[Upper Travers Hut](https://preview.redd.it/ih38115ju0dg1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f53395841f93e50eb2a5102918ad8b69b9bb75b)

*Day 16 (18km, +1200m, -1300m, 8.5h) -* Started in the rain climbing straight up Travers Saddle, immediately outside the hut. The saddle was traversable in these conditions, and I think it would only be a bad idea when extreme temp exposure would be a factor. Incredible views from the top in both directions. Extremely steep drop down to the river on the other side. Follow along (with a lot of major side stream crossings) to West Sabine Hut for lunch. Then pushed on in deteriorating weather to Blue Lake Hut for the night.

[Travers Saddle](https://preview.redd.it/chd1dd8mu0dg1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0622778430f06f8622ff9f5537290e11ac561aa)

*Day 17 (23.5km, +1000m, -1300m, 9h) -* Based on the forecast we had available, we expected the weather on this day to be poor, but more favourable than other days to cross Waiau Pass. Based on a discussion with rangers in St Arnaud, I proposed we first reached the base of the pass at the head of Lake Constance for a visibility check, then push to check the snow accumulation on the southern side (which rangers said was usually worse). We pushed on in very cold weather and light snow to the base, including steep sidling around the lake. Given we could still see several ski poles at a time we ascended the pass. This was extremely steep 60+ degree scree, including a 500m sidle at the top of the scree slope. At the top we decided to continue despite very poor conditions, given the visibility was similar and we felt it would be unsafe to descend the scree in the conditions we had. At this point it was -6C with 70km/h winds, so we had to keep moving for warmth. The southern side featured significant scrambling on icy rocks before reaching the Waiau River at the base. I pushed on and elected to camp a few km south of the sandfly infested Waiau Hut.

*In hindsight this was borderline weather for the pass.* The biggest risk would have been descending the north side in the conditions we had. I dont see where avalanches could accumulate here but there was significant slip and fall risk. If you get bad conditions it may be better to exit via the travers sabine circuit to lake Roturua than attempt the pass. Please be safe.

*Day 18 (24km, +/-350m, 7.5h) -* Very straightforward day following the valley. Large number of stream crossings and strong wind. Expansive views of the open country of the St James Station. Ended the day at Anne Hut, by far the most luxurious that I used.

*Day 19 (18.5km, +/- 550m, 6h)* \- Relatively easy day continuing the St James Walkway to Boyle Flat Hut.

*Day 20 (13km, +300m, -500m, 4h)* \- Exited to Boyle, where a couple on the walkway very kindly dropped me into Hamner Springs on their way past.

**Section 4 - Exiting the Trail**

When in Hamner Springs I was able to check forecasts and see reports of other hikers that the track condition was poor to unpassable between Boyle and Arthurs Pass, due to a combination of river flooding and Spring storm damage. I decided to get off trail for Christmas, and planned to get back in at Tekapo (to avoid the minimum river transfer charges discussed below). Unfortunately around this time a walker was found dead in a river within this section.

After Christmas I attempted to return to the trail in tekapo, however was informed that the weather had once again deteriorated. At this point the logistical demands of the mid-south island were already wearing me down, and the prospect of needing to change plans on the fly if the next section was unpassable, at a time where all local accomodation was booked solid for new year was undesirable. There was also no desire to attempt the Timaru Creek section in poor weather among our group due to its dangerous reputation that claimed a walkers life last season. At that point I felt the mental load of the trail was outweighing my enjoyment of walking and decided to stop.

# Lessons Learned

* **Consumable resupply:** Resupply of specific items can be hard on this trail. I took way too little tape to start with in terms of taping hot spots. Tape is ruined by water most days. Take a whole roll. 110g gas is also very hard to get. 230g is much more common.
* **Hygenie:** Normally I don't worry too much, but you need to consider that you are often sharing huts from the Richmond's onwards. Bring a bar of soap
* **Footwear and Socks**: More an observation of others. Make sure you have done at least a week of continuous hiking in your setup. Lots of people hadn't tried theirs for long enough, or in wet and dry conditions, so ran into issues.
* **Resupply strategy:** I bought groceries in Wellington and Picton and posted from Picton to: St Arnaud, Pelorus Bridge, Boyle and Arthurs Pass. This cost about $200 NZD including postage and collection fees. Id make the following changes: Only post to St Arnaud if walking from Havelock to St Arnaud. If hitching, you gain nothing as the four square is really well stocked. St Arnaud Parcel definitely worth it due to Alpine Store Prices, however you could resupply here at a high cost. Boyle is essential if continuing directly, although Hamner is an extremely nice place for a zero and a very easy hitch. Arthurs Pass, also essential as there is nowhere to resupply without an inconvenient hitch.
* **When Kiwi's take Holidays:** The transition from before christmas to after is pretty crazy. Basically noone on holiday before and easy to get accomodation, to booked solid immediately after. Particularly bad in southern cantebury and Queenstown/Wanaka, so be aware when planning.

# Closing Thoughts

I think you need to go into the TA well aware of the logistical effort required. Particularly after Boyle you need to constantly look for river levels, think about alternative plans for routes, hitches and accommodation. The major rivers (Rakai and Rangitata) have minimum charges for shuttles. This can be a pain if solo ahead of the bubble too. The mental demands of managing these took away from the trail experience for me, and significantly contributed to my getting off trail. If you are like me and just want to do some logistics up front then just hike once you hit the trail, I highly recommend a section hike from Ships Cove to Boyle (probably fly into Wellington and out of Christchurch). One of the most stunning section hikes in the world.

I don't say this to discourage anyone at all - if you are completely fine with changing plans on the fly and taking things as they come (I think its easier if you don't have much time pressure) the trail is incredible.

Let me know if you have any questions about this part of the trail. Hope it helps!",6,1768269000.0,UltralightAus,1,1.0,False

I've lived comfortably malnourished and dehydrated for years. Along with smoking and drinking, often very heavily, since I was 13, I've always somehow remained fit, but definitely not healthy. After a recent breakup and consideration about what I want my life ahead to be, I realized that I'd never be able to enjoy it if I kept living the way I have been. For context, I'm 6'1"" and around 150lbs (the same size I was in high school.

The changes I made:
Diet - I used to eat one frozen tv dinner and a couple Little Debbie snacks in the evening with only coffee and a 20oz soda throughout the day at most. Now I eat a granola bar and drink a glass of orange juice before work. Drink a few cups of water during the day. And eat a meal I prepared with a focus on balancing carbs, protein, fiber, and nutrients with a bottle of water with a few squirts of flavor stuff.

Alcohol - I was drinking 3-6 beers every evening. I now fix one high quality bourbon old fashioned right before bed.

Smoking - I was smoking a pack a day. I'm now smoking 2 black and mild cigars after work and 3 on each day off as a way to adjust to smoking less. Working toward quitting that too soon.

I am so frustrated with my weight loss journey. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong because I thought I was doing everything right to lose weight. I am definitely in a calorie deficit every day, but I am not losing weight. 

Diet: I work with a dietician on a regular basis. She has me on a set plan where I am at least getting 50g of protein a day (which was previously an issue for me since I don’t eat meat). I eat things like rice, beans, veggies, eggs, apples, nut butters, hummus, etc on a regular basis. I always drink water. I drink coffee and/or tea almost every day. 

Exercise: I used to go to an expensive gym and do a wide range of activities that did nothing to help me lose weight. I canceled my gym membership and instead now just use a walking pad to get steps in during the day. Then I often go for a walk in the evening. And sometimes I will do some light jogging. My steps usually average about 7-8 miles a day. 

Sleep & Stress: I have heard that both of these factors could contribute to not losing weight, so I’m listing them here only to say that I have great sleep quality and just “normal” levels of stress but nothing crazy. I guess I can just say “low stress.” 

Age: I am in my mid 40s. And I’m female. 

Medications: I take 2 medications for depression.

So here’s where I’m at. I gained this weight about 4-5 years ago and have been STRUGGLING to lose weight for the last several years. It’s been in this last year that I got much more serious about it but nothing is working. I track all of my food in Lose It down to every last little calorie. Everything. I track my exercise. I even put into the app that I did LESS exercise than I actually did just so I can be extra sure if I’m in a deficit or not. 

I am in a deficit every single day and my weight hasn’t budged. And it’s not just about the scale. I can still see and feel every little bit of weight that has refused to go away. I take pictures and I look exactly the same. 

Am I doomed? Is it my age like I’m just in that period of life where it’s impossible to lose weight? Maybe my depression medications are preventing me from losing weight?

I just don’t know. And I’m so worn out and frustrated. If anyone out there can provide any advice or encouragement, I would appreciate it so much. Thank you!",2,1768268628.0,WeightLossAdvice,14,0.75,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Curations by The Good Scent Vanilla Cloud smelled like berries and other fruit which is strange since fruit is not listed among the notes. I have never gotten fig leaf when I smelled Toasted Macadamia before. I tried to sniff it this time, but the atomizer was missing. Welp. 

The Aubusson Noted line had one called Oud Bouquet or Velvet Bouquet not shown here that I have been hunting for since last Summer. Glad to see two out of three are back. Vanilla Fleur definitely smells like something. I assume Rock Candy is trying to be Kayali VCRS, so I didn’t even smell it. 

Flower Rush has a pretty bottle even though the matching cap is plastic. I don’t remember being wowed by the scent. I was distracted by all the Sand + Fog perfume oils (per my previous post). 

Three rando Vanillas. Forever 21 Vanilla Sunrise does not smell like Vanilla to me. It was fruity. I didn’t smell either of the Velvet Vanillas but I love the Tahari bottle. Velvet Vanilla Cream is by Tru Fragrance, and this is their line of gourmands. There are so many in this particular collection. I think the coffee one was good (not pictured).

1qbe37g,https://i.redd.it/zz31rcu4p0dg1.jpeg,Review #91: Weller Special Reserve,"Weller Special Reserve (got a sample from a friends bottle)

Distillery: Buffalo Trace

Age: NAS

Price: They paid $49.99

Proof: 90

Nose: There's a cedar woodiness to it with an underlying sweetness throughout. Kind of like what I'd expect a No. 2 pencil dipped in honey to smell like. Weird visual but here we are. Some berry. Ethanol is a little more noticeable than expected. But the woody, almost earthy note is my biggest takeaway.

Palate: Thin to medium mouthfeel. There's the slightest bitter grain note that feels a youthful. Still has an earthiness to it, but not nearly as noticeable as in the nose. Coffee grounds. Blueberry. Vanilla.

Finish: About medium length. Simply put: it's mellow and easy.  Caramel. Cherry. Vanilla. Almost custardy. It lingers enough to call it medium length IMO, but in terms of intensity it's very light. For lack of a better phrase it seems to lift and linger.

Score: 5.2

Summary: I've always had an unusual relationship with Weller Special Reserve. I used to buy it regularly over a decade ago and it always hit me as a ""smooth"" sip that for some reason I never really liked. This sample was no different. As someone who generally stays away from notes on the earthier side I don't think the nose brings much to the table for me, and the palate isn't much better. It's not that it's off putting, it's just not my thing and quite frankly not what I want in a wheated bourbon. However, the finish is nice and lends massively to me viewing WSR as an easy sipper. On the same coin the finish lacks boldness and is not very complex. I have to say this is likely my least favorite allocated bourbon (if it's allocated or hard to come by in your area - I know it's readily available for lots of people). And by a mile it's my least favorite of the Weller line. I know this review comes off as pretty negative, but it's still a fine and perfectly drinkable bourbon. Just not what it's cracked up to be by some IMO. I'll put it slightly above plain old Makers and give it a 5.2.

1. Terrible | Drain pour after the first sip
2. Very Bad | Trying to choke it down but possible drain pour
3. Poor | Would drink if forced to but never under my own will
4. Below Average | Not off-putting but not my cup of tea
5. Average | I'll take it
6. Good | Enjoyable sip
7. Very Good | Well above average

She'd text me and I'd be too busy to reply but when I did the conversations just flowed effortlessly. We started talking more and more, I started to develop feelings towards her and she, I. We'd hang out outside of work and have flirty banter. I'd cook for her and she'd do the same for me. We'd sing along to music in the car, compliment each other often, take photos together, go on adventures, I'd write/draw her notes and she'd do the same for me. Late night convos over the phone deep Into the night. Our first kiss was on her birthday (ironically) we've been intimate a couple of times, never sexually. But there's been a lot of intimate moments. It was honestly magical.

I'd isolated myself for the last 3-4 years around COVID time, isolated myself from my friends, family, lovers etc. I was in a bad place mentally and I just felt like I didn't deserve to be loved. I worked on myself during that time, got my diploma and started getting back into shape. So when I met her it was like a breath of fresh air. She's hilarious, affectionate, empathetic, generous, a great listener and a sight for sore eyes, etc. All qualities I admire in a partner. I'd even venture to say she's the best lover I've had so far. 

But, there's always a but. She's a JW, a devout one at that volunteers/attend meetings multiple times a week. I however am what you call a luke warm Christian, I'll pray when I need to, go to church when I feel like it, I like to practice my faith individually away from the judgeful eyes of the church (My church at least). I just asked her today what the future was going to look like for us her being JW and what not. I explained holidays and birthdays are big in my family and would love to share those moments with her and my family, I asked if she'd attend family gatherings and not engage in the festivities or if I'd have to go alone to all of them. I also asked if the kids would be raised in the same faith as her etc. I was omw back from music lessons and she happened to be on her break, so I stopped by at work and she came to the car and she started crying before even getting in, it devastated me, seeing her hurt and there was nothing I could do about it, but I knew I had my answer. We talked for the whole 30 minutes with her intermittent cries, I tried to comfort her to the best of my ability and give her space to process it. We didn't establish what the nature of our relationship will be moving forward. 

I've done the whole leading women on thing in my late teens, early 20s and it's a recipe for disaster and I've been working through that. Being less selfish that is. I'm working on being honest about my intentions and feelings just to ensure me and my partner are on the same page.

My question is how do I navigate this moving forward, will I ever find someone else as good as this woman who loves me unconditionally and shows me she does, do I continue to be flirty/hang out with her at/outside of work? The late night convos do they cease completely? We started off as friends I guess that's why it feels so frustrating because it feels like I'll be loosing a good friend by creating distance between us both? How do I keep composure seeing her moving on w/o me?

He's in town for a few days, so yesterday him, my 9 y/o son and me went out to some book stores in a big city nearby.
It was freezing cold, it has been snowing for the past few days and there was a nasty wind.
At the end of our trip, before heading home, we went to a supermarket.
Outside there was a homeless man, sitting on the ground and he was crying, it broke my heart.
So, I went to the supermarket and bought a big cup of coffee to warm him up.
I don't drink coffee, so I was struggling with the coffee machine (wouldn't take my card at first, bla bla bla), whilst doing that, my son ran off.
About a minute later, he came back with a bag of sandwiches ""for the man outside"", he then went off again to get some charcuterie,  because he needed that too,  for his sandwiches.

I was SO proud of him!

He followed her, the hunched over black robed and hooded goblin shape that had only the semblance of a woman's old and weathered voice with which to perhaps mark her as human. 

She was not one of God's children. 

He followed her into the graveyard. So that they might fulfill the rite. 

And pull one back. 

She said it could be done. The thing that might be a woman that called itself Maab. And though it was vile blasphemy to do so, Wyckoff prayed that the foul shape in black was able to actually perform the ebon necromantic arts.

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition.

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

*Using the reference image I’ve uploaded as the subject, photograph this person wearing striking everyday wear in black and white tones, styled in a relatable, authentic urban setting. The outfit features sharp, modern pieces with subtle architectural elements—perhaps a structured black oversized blazer paired with crisp white wide-leg trousers, or an asymmetrical black and white color-blocked sweater with tailored black jeans and white sneakers. The silhouette should feel contemporary and wearable while maintaining clean lines and geometric contrast that echoes the architectural aesthetic.*

*Place the subject in a casual urban location like a trendy coffee shop, a vibrant street corner, an indie clothing boutique, or an urban park. The background should feel lived-in and authentic with visible depth—shelving, warm ambient lighting, other people casually going about their day, real textures like exposed brick, worn wooden surfaces, or street-level details. The subject is styled in a way that feels effortless and cool—hair natural and undone with textured waves or a messy bun, minimal natural makeup that looks like “no makeup makeup.” The vibe is authentically “just living my life” with intentional style.*

*Create a rich, cinematic bokeh effect in the background—use shallow depth of field to keep the subject in sharp focus while the background elements (cafe lights, street signage, other people) blur into soft, glowing bokeh. The bokeh should feel warm and atmospheric, with golden and amber tones that create visual depth and separation from the background.*

*The lighting should be warm and golden—inspired by golden hour or cozy indoor ambient lighting. Use professional cinematic color grading with rich contrast, warm undertones, and slightly desaturated blacks and whites that feel moody yet inviting. The color palette should emphasize the black and white contrast of the outfit while the surrounding environment glows with warm golden and amber tones. Create visual depth through the bokeh and lighting interplay.*

*Capture genuine, candid moments—the subject looking off thoughtfully, adjusting their outfit, walking naturally through the space, or pausing mid-stride. The composition should feel like a lifestyle photo from a contemporary fashion editorial or high-end lifestyle Instagram account—alive, authentic, and emotionally engaging. Shot in 16:9 widescreen cinematic aspect ratio that emphasizes the environmental context and creates a cinematic frame.

When I started to become more calmer, I was sitting in a local coffee shop waiting for my order but then I saw everyone around me just starring at their phones like the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Couples sitting together but not talking. People waiting three minutes for coffee and acting like those three minutes were annoying. And it hit me that I used to do the exact same thing without even noticing it.

Now, what helped me stick with the detox wasn’t discipline or motivation. Tbh I don’t have that much willpower haha. So what helped was understanding why I spent too much time doing these things in the first place: Reading a few books helped me achieving this.

[Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work): Re-learn how to focus deeply

It showed me how rare real focus has become. I started blocking time where my phone stayed in another room. At first it felt dramatic and kind of stupid tbh. But after a few sessions, it totally made the difference. This my fav book so far

[Dopamine Nation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55723020-dopamine-nation): Reset your brain’s dopamine balance

This book made me realize scrolling stopped being about fun a long time ago. I just realized it’s mostly about escaping discomfort. My brain learned to escape the moment things got boring, so silence felt wrong. Once I understood that, I stopped grabbing my phone for comfort and started embracing the silence I needed.

[Hooked](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22668729-hooked): See how apps are designed to hook you

This made me hate all social media apps fr. It explains how products trap you in loops with triggers and random rewards. I stopped scrolling through shitty videos and posts and I buried social apps, removed shortcuts, and made accessing them annoying on purpose.

Reading changed how I think, but these tools helped me actually do something with that clarity.

[Notion](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/notion-notas-tareas-e-ia/id1232780281): Clear the noise in your head

This tool helped me to get ideas out of my head and onto a page. Goals, habits, random thoughts, EVERYTHING. You can easily do this in paper, but I'd rather using it here. That alone reduced a ton of mental noise.

[Purposa](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/purposa-chase-your-dreams/id6748883803): Focus on your one daily goal

Literally the title. It has some pretty interesting features yeah, but this one alone made the whole difference. Instead of bunch of daily goals, I just focused on the most important one. This tool made me more focus and consistent in my goals.

[Opal](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/opal-tiempo-de-pantalla-focus/id1497465230): Protect your attention

It blocked distracting apps during focus time so willpower didn't decide for me. Fortunately, this made me focus longer and starting losing FOMO.

But well, I still use my phone and I still use Reddit (to learn and give value, no more than that). I just don’t feel I am attached to it anymore.

Quitting social media wasn’t easy AT ALL, don’t get me wrong. I had a terrible FOMO at first, but then it started to decrease. So yeah, it gets easier.

So start small: Delete one app, read one chapter, write one page and track one habit. This will led you to the goal you always wanted.

You’re just building a high-stress cage with better wallpaper.","I’m tired of seeing everyone on X chasing the $10k MRR dragon like it’s the finish line. It’s not. For 90% of you, $10k MRR is actually the worst possible place your SaaS can be.

Here is the math nobody wants to admit:



At $2k MRR: You’re a lean, mean, indie machine. Low overhead, low stress. If the server goes down for an hour, you fix it when you finish your coffee. It’s a side hustle that buys you time.

At $10k MRR: You’ve entered the \*\*Valley of Death.\*\*

You’re now too big to ignore support tickets, but too poor to hire a full-time Success Manager. You’re the dev, the janitor, the marketer, and the guy apologizing to a $19/mo customer at 3 AM because an API changed. 

You didn't buy your freedom. You traded a 40-hour week for an 80-hour week where the boss (you) is a total asshole who never lets you take a vacation. 

The Lifestyle Trap is real. We’ve fetishized ""The Grind"" so much that we’ve forgotten why we started. If your SaaS requires you to be tethered to a dashboard 24/7 just to keep the churn from eating your growth, \*\*you don't own a business. You own a high-liability job.\*\*

I’d honestly rather have a $3k MRR micro-tool that runs on autopilot than a $12k MRR ""beast"" that requires me to be a slave to Stripe notifications.

Change my mind, or tell me how much you’re currently paying for your ""freedom.""

1qbdrkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1qbdrkd/5_dreams_of_being_killed_in_sleep_paralysis/,5 dreams of being killed in sleep paralysis,"Fell asleep with a fever from bone infection on Easter weekend 2023, and woke up in a dream I wasn’t aware I was dreaming. It was night and underneath me were interlocking stone streets that were wet, and glistened black. I looked up and I was looking up a street lined with old double story buildings. Like you’d see in Venice, Italian city or Marseilles, France. There was a full moon low in the sky in the centre of the street. I could hear a woman’s laughter coming from somewhere echoes, but I couldn’t see her. I turned around and there was another street and the maniacal laughter continued and there was a full moon down that street. I spun around and a third street was the same, dark wet, cobblestone streets, with a full moon. The cackling of what I believed to be a witch I knew but didn’t know had me confused at the centre of 5 points where all the avenue’s looked the same. Her voice was familiar but not familiar. I started walking down one of the streets. I looked up into dark and light windows along the way, not sure if she was hiding in one of these room or doorways, or up on the roof.



I woke up shaking myself out of the fevered dream, almost paralyzed from what I thought was sleep paralysis. I sat up and tried to stay awake long enough so I wouldn’t slip back into sleep paralysis. I fell back to sleep and then I was walking on a paved street into an urban ghetto area. Lined with fences for basketball courts and a skateboard park. There was graffiti on the cement wall along one side up where a skateboarders landing was. I started sliding forward, down the street losing grip on the pavement. I wasn’t grounded and I tried to catch my footing but had no weight to me, I gained momentum as I was falling horizontal. I couldn’t stop myself and saw a chain link fence maybe 12 feet high with razor wire on top. I slammed into it stopping my fall, I could see it was dusk with the orange and purple lined clouds that were in the sky in the horizon. The landscape beyond the fence was like death valley down in the United States, Nevada maybe? Or a huge gorge of some place. My body hit the fence so hard my face was embedded into the chain link fence, through my lips, cheek and eye socket and cheek bone into my temple and skull into my brain and teeth and nasal cavity. I tried to free myself by shaking my head, like I would in a sleep paralysis to wake myself up. But it was excruciating, i felt the metal in my brain, face bones and teeth. I tried to shake loose but it hurt and gave up. I saw the fence was a barrier and I was at the top of a cliff stuck. The fence slowly started falling into this deep stone Gorge. I couldn’t stop it and fell attached to the fence unable to wake up or free myself until I slammed into the stone floor below of rubble and boulders. I woke up still feeling the pain in my face and head and shook it off., I said to myself I hope I don’t continue that dream, and fell back to sleep into another dream.



I was then in an apartment I used to live in with my old roommate, upstairs in the kitchen. My roommate was tall, thin and white, with a huge smile that showed his teeth and made his eyes crinkle and face when he was happy and I made him laugh with dumb jokes. Etc. He was cooking in our small kitchen and in the stove he had something in the oven, it was hot in the kitchen. I wanted to see if he was burning whatever was in there. But he was in the way and I tried to get around this guy, eventually opening the oven beside him smiling and laughing trying to block me and he tried to assure me he had it under control. In the oven was a cookie sheet with charcoal briquette’s that I thought were burnt biscuits. I went to take them out with no oven mitt’s burning my hand and put them on the counter where there was a plastic cutting board, with filtered sunlight coming through the blinds half open and down onto part of the counter. I saw it was melting through and the briquette’s were now hot cinder embers, glowing black and orange. I took one and put it in my mouth, and tried to swallow it, and felt it burn going down into my stomach. I put another one in my mouth and swallowed it then a third and a fourth. The last one came out my cheek and through the lining of my mouth and another out my lower jaw under my tongue, another through my stomach and sternum and flesh and skin. Another was coming out of my throat and I couldn’t figure out what to do. He was laughing at me, and i stumbled to the doorway, and outside and people were out there that knew me but i didn’t know them. I was dying with burning holes in my chest and face and throat, they patted me on the back as i went downn the wooden staircase outside, congratulating me, “way to go buddy” and laughing as i fell down the stairs and hit the ground i woke up again sitting up. Trying to shake off the vivid unsettling dream, I hoped I wouldn’t fall asleep again and continue that dream, I fell asleep again.



I woke up in my the backyard of my old home when I was a kid when I was 10 years old but I wasn’t any age I knew. I was at the back shop at the side and my mother was calling me in and I saw the clouds when i looked up from the ground and wooden planter’s i was working in the soil, getting it ready to plant something, putting earthworms and fertilizer, getting it ready for plants. The storm started with wild gusts of wind and as i was moving the planter from left to right to the ground I started choking. The rain was small black seed’s that were light and I inhaled them and they were filling my throat, nose and lungs. I couldn’t stop inhaling them and was being smothered by a never-ending torrent of what i thought was linseed, or some small black seed that was fine almost as dust. I felt them smother me and was buried in them over the planter i put down. Waking me up again I felt the smother I had dreamed but i think i may have been under the covers in bed.



Again I’m in another dreams-cape. Finding myself from outside of myself and then drifting into a man standing at the back of a white moving van with blacked out windows under a streetlight flooding the van back doors and the man with light. I find myself behind the eyes of him, dressed in a work uniform. I’m now moving boxes of different sized parcels from the back I opened up. With an uneasy feeling I’m being watched from the shadows behind me somewhere, being stalked by thieves perhaps, or my wife’s lover, or someone who was randomly looking for an easy victim. I glance behind me and to the side hearing something in the dark beyond the light where my eyes couldn’t see. I try to hurry because it’s the last of these deliveries on my shift and I was looking forward to getting a hot chocolate or coffee. I felt a warm wet feeling hit my legs as I unloaded several more half done moving. I thought it felt like I spilled my hot liquid down waist to my knees, and looked down thinking it felt more like a bowl of vegetable soup because it was gushing. I saw it was my blood, and felt a hand reach around me from behind and slice into my stomach where i saw the box cutter in his hand had sliced my abdomen across from right to left where blood poured down my pants, and the hand then carved up to the right from the left where he finished the first slice and zigzagged up raking the blade in and across my chest deep s, i felt my entrails and innards start to pull and fall out and down as he slide the razor sharp tool up and across my thorax then back across under my arm and i crumpled to the ground and felt the burn and the front of me falling apart like i was a hung animal being carved and bled, unable to scream as the last of the slices cut my throat deep to through my vocal cords to the spine. I wake up again still feeling this, like i was murdered in real life, and begged i can’t take anymore being killed dreams, shaking off the paralysis and the feelings i fell back asleep that Saturday night before Easter morning.",1,1768267520.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

1qbdrhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTech/comments/1qbdrhe/tracking_gut_health_through_poop_data_what_ive/,Tracking gut health through poop data — what I’ve learned building CleverPoop,"Over the last 9 months I’ve been building CleverPoop, a gut health tracking app that helps users log bowel movements, symptoms, and contextual inputs.

The core engine of the app is a lightweight image classification model I trained to classify stool images into Bristol Stool Chart types (Type 1 to 7). The output is a simple BSC label, which the app uses downstream to surface trends. 

Think of it as a self-tracking layer that respects privacy while reducing the friction of manual classification.

Beyond the image model, the app tracks

* Timing and frequency of bowel movements
* Symptom tags like bloating, urgency, pain, incomplete emptying
* Contextual inputs (not full food logging, but things like “ate spicy food,” “high fiber meal,” or “coffee on empty stomach”)

I’ve also started writing short educational articles inside the app to help users make sense of what they are tracking. These are based on published research and cover topics like how to interpret stool consistency, what influences gut transit time, and why normal can look different for different people. The goal is to inform through evidence, not to give medical advice.

Where I’m still experimenting

* Striking the right balance between simplicity and depth
* Exploring whether this structured journaling model could support dietitians, GI coaches, or even research use cases

Would love to hear from anyone building in gut health, digital biomarkers, or behavior tracking. Especially curious how others have approached engagement, feedback loops, and scope boundaries between wellness and clinical.

Here's **the prompt**:

*Using the reference image I’ve uploaded as the subject, photograph this person wearing striking everyday wear in black and white tones, styled in a relatable, authentic urban setting. The outfit features sharp, modern pieces with subtle architectural elements—perhaps a structured black oversized blazer paired with crisp white wide-leg trousers, or an asymmetrical black and white color-blocked sweater with tailored black jeans and white sneakers. The silhouette should feel contemporary and wearable while maintaining clean lines and geometric contrast that echoes the architectural aesthetic.*

*Place the subject in a casual urban location like a trendy coffee shop, a vibrant street corner, an indie clothing boutique, or an urban park. The background should feel lived-in and authentic with visible depth—shelving, warm ambient lighting, other people casually going about their day, real textures like exposed brick, worn wooden surfaces, or street-level details. The subject is styled in a way that feels effortless and cool—hair natural and undone with textured waves or a messy bun, minimal natural makeup that looks like “no makeup makeup.” The vibe is authentically “just living my life” with intentional style.*

*Create a rich, cinematic bokeh effect in the background—use shallow depth of field to keep the subject in sharp focus while the background elements (cafe lights, street signage, other people) blur into soft, glowing bokeh. The bokeh should feel warm and atmospheric, with golden and amber tones that create visual depth and separation from the background.*

*The lighting should be warm and golden—inspired by golden hour or cozy indoor ambient lighting. Use professional cinematic color grading with rich contrast, warm undertones, and slightly desaturated blacks and whites that feel moody yet inviting. The color palette should emphasize the black and white contrast of the outfit while the surrounding environment glows with warm golden and amber tones. Create visual depth through the bokeh and lighting interplay.*

*Capture genuine, candid moments—the subject looking off thoughtfully, adjusting their outfit, walking naturally through the space, or pausing mid-stride. The composition should feel like a lifestyle photo from a contemporary fashion editorial or high-end lifestyle Instagram account—alive, authentic, and emotionally engaging. Shot in 16:9 widescreen cinematic aspect ratio that emphasizes the environmental context and creates a cinematic frame. The overall aesthetic is accessible luxury—real people, real settings, but elevated through thoughtful styling, cinematic lighting, and professional color grading.*

1qbdqwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1qbdqwy/i_enjoy_a_lot_of_cool_thingsthat_doctors_said/,"I enjoy a lot of cool things(that doctors said they are bad), how about you?","Hi, I am a newcomer here, and I think that I may drop kinda controversial topic here.

I live in South Korea, and I am studying software development.

Although doctors said that addictive, or intense hobbies are bad for Autism, or ADHD, I enjoy a lot of things that they didn't recommend.

1. I enjoy coffee

I drink a lot of coffee. I started enjoying Moka pot coffee since I was 14 years old.

Doctors say that is bad for my sensory system(I don't know how to translate it in English, I hope you understand), but when I quit it I sometimes miss its fragrant scent..

I tried my best to make better morning coffee shot, and I don't sure if it matters.

Currently, I have a deal for it. I only drink Ethiopian single origin beans, guess they may meditate me.

2. I don't sleep early.

I usually sleep late when I study software development(especially when I tweak a kernel tbh), I guess this is not good for my brain health.

But sleeping early(near 8PM? 10PM?) took my times to play games, or to take a rest.

3. Is it safe to listen to Metal? I don't know, I'll just keep going.

Doctors recommended that listening to calm and silent music, like Classical, or Jazz, maybe Blues? is recommended, but I listen to many kinds of music.

And of course, I listen to Metal too.

Although my favorite music genre is Piedmont Blues, I listen to Heavy Metal, or even Black Metal, Death Metal, and when it comes to Classical, I listen to Stockhausen, Schoenberg...

I don't listen to soft music genres, sadly(like Ballads, K-Pop, New Age, Ambient), which are quite recommended.

In a same context, I watch many adult contents...

  
**But I think it is important to enjoy my life.**

When are care for this neuro-divergent, and you know, kinda boring therapies those are restricting lifestyle...I can't enjoy my life(though I can quit them).

  
I don't think that enjoying delicious coffee with Cool Metal Album...

I'd like to listen to your opinions about my ""messy"" hobbies.

Thank you.",11,1768267469.0,AutisticWithADHD,10,0.93,False
