Already did coffee first date so drinks second date didn't seem interesting. Ended up spending more than I'd like on food and drinks at a decent restaurant, only for the woman to slow fade me to rejection afterwards.

  
Typically for second dates I'd like to do a cheap date like going to the park, but this woman insisted on weeknight date, which basically meant food and drinks, since all the parks are closed. Is it a red flag that a woman demands a weeknight date, or should I just expect to wine and dine women on second dates?",1,1728960303.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Sorry this is a long post. 

We're coworkers, and things had been going well‚Äîhe's consistently made plans with me (outside of the bedroom like nice dinners, coffee dates etc), including a recent day trip to go hiking. We've both expressed that we like each other, and he‚Äôs been open about his feelings. The sex is also incredible for both of us. I also haven‚Äôt noticed any red flags and he seemed to have self awareness. We haven‚Äôt had the exclusive talk but frankly I hadn‚Äôt felt ready anyway because I recently got out of a long term relationship. 

This week, we have a heart to heart and he mentions that he‚Äôs stressed because he wants to keep seeing me but it‚Äôs a lot for him with everything else going on in his life (I won‚Äôt get into it but his job requires a lot out of him and he doesn‚Äôt get home until 9pm on most weeknights) so he asked if I‚Äôm okay only seeing each other on weekends during his busy work season if us dating were to continue down the line. I told him that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm not in a rush to hangout all the time anyway & I have my own life too. We agreed to that and then planned our day trip for the weekend. 

However, the night before the trip, he slept over and we played a game where we asked each other deep questions, and after I asked him to elaborate on some of his answers, the mood shifted. He seemed annoyed and when we fell asleep, he didn‚Äôt cuddle me like he normally did. I tried not to overthink it but the tension carried into our car ride the next morning. 

In the car, he opens up that he felt I challenged him on every question in the game and how I seemed off the entire night. So, because of that, he shut down. I told him that I had a long day but it wasn‚Äôt my intention at all to be hard on him about his answers. He told me he doesn‚Äôt expect things to be perfect but that it threw him off. I apologized and said how I appreciated him being honest with me. We continued the day, went on our hike and it was great. Everything felt back to normal‚Äîhe was affectionate, we were laughing again, etc. 

Then we had lunch and he again brought up doubts about our relationship, saying he was stressed with work (which I do believe because he‚Äôs getting home at 9pm most days), that he is worried because we‚Äôre different in a lot of ways, and unsure about what this would look like going forward. I heard his concern, but told him that honestly it seemed like he wasn't that into me (and that that‚Äôs okay!), and I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs the point of continuing this with his doubts, but he just kept saying he needed time to figure things out. 

Side note‚ÄîHe asked how I was feeling, and I said ""sad,"" to which he replied, ""sad or devastated?"" In my head, I‚Äôm like, ""do you expect me to cry over you?"" He‚Äôs rejecting me in another country‚ÄîI‚Äôll cry when I get home. The conversation didn‚Äôt go reach a conclusion and we started the drive back. 

While driving, he began taking deep breaths, touching his face, and his eyes were red. It literally looked like a panic attack, but he claimed he was just tired. We stopped at a rest stop, and he eventually seemed better, and when we resumed, he apologized for dampening the afternoon. Then he said, ‚Äúmaybe I just need a couple of days or weeks to get my shit together.‚Äù I suggested he should date other people (trying to give him an out to end things) but he insisted he didn‚Äôt want to and that it‚Äôs a life decision of whether to continue this with me, and if he‚Äôs going to be with someone it would be me. I told him it‚Äôs up to him to figure that out but it‚Äôs not on me and I‚Äôm not waiting around for him. And he understood. Then, he had the nerve to ask if I wanted him to drop me off or stay over again. I said uh no! 

I thought we were over, but his comments on the drive back confused me. 

Now, two days later, we haven't spoken and I don‚Äôt plan on reaching out. I‚Äôm left wondering what caused this sudden shift in mood and having doubts (because he seriously was so into me through words and actions even a day before that) and if he‚Äôs truly interested in me or just confused about what he wants. He does deal with anxiety and depression, but I'm unsure if that's a factor here.

My husband‚Äôs birthday was just a few days ago. I wanted to take him out to dinner and he said he just wanted a lowkey birthday at home, so I respected his wishes. We have been married for 3 years and together for 7. We have two children 2 and 3 years old. In the past years I‚Äôve always tried my best to make him feel special on his birthday. Baking his favorite cake, made his favorite meals, did a surprise bday celebration one year, have decorated the house, and got him presents. His parents and siblings Don‚Äôt do anything for his birthday and always act like it‚Äôs any other day. His own dad forgot his bday this year and I had to call him to remind him. 

For this birthday, I got his favorite coffee and donuts when he woke up. Had baked two apple pies per his request the night before with my sister after working a full work day and taking care of my kids (he works nights and isn‚Äôt home till 9:30-10) I Had balloons downstairs and his presents from me and the kids waiting to be ready when he walked downstairs.  Everything was going well the morning of his birthday. We got home that afternoon and I stared to get a really bad headache. I‚Äôm under a lot of pressure and get headaches often. I‚Äôm the main caretaker of my children, home, and I work full time in a very difficult and demanding job. My husband tries to help, but always uses his commute and work as an excuse. Anyways, he asked me what was wrong and I told him my head was hurting badly. He was so upset and said ‚Äúwow, even on my birthday I have to deal with your bullshit‚Äù threw a tantrum, then everything went downhill from there. 

My 3 year old wasn‚Äôt listening during lunch so my husband took him up to his room slammed the door shut, and started yelling at him and I ran up there to rescue my son and told my husband not to ever yell at him like that. I was already in semi tears bc of his response to my headache and then my husband told me in front of my 3 year old ‚ÄúI hate you, yelled and said I want a divorce‚Äù then things escalated very badly. I didn‚Äôt care it was his birthday anymore and I was so overwhelmed with sadness so I left. A few hours pass by and I tell my husband let‚Äôs just have pizza and pretend for the kids since they were so excited to sing happy birthday etc. He then proceeds to tell me this is the worst day of his life & he‚Äôs the saddest he‚Äôs ever been in his life and that I left to punish him & I didn‚Äôt make him feel special. At this point his birthday doesn‚Äôt even matter since he said all those terrible things to me. 

My birthday is coming up in 2 weeks and I just don‚Äôt want to do anything with him at all. I promised myself to focus on my health for this birth year and stop putting my energy into him since he doesn‚Äôt give me the energy I feel I deserve. How can I communicate to him the reasoning behind why  I don‚Äôt want to spend my birthday with him this year? ",1,1728959619.0,relationship_advice,5,0.99,False

i like to get a drink for a first date not dinner or any food 1 cause i get shy eating on a first date and 2 to have the ability to keep it on the shorter side if it‚Äôs not going well. i dont drink and drive, thus leading to them picking me up. on one hand, i like the chivalry when a guy offers to pick me up. and i think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with asking them to either. but then i get in my head like now ill be alone with him in the car who knows where he will take me or what he will do to me, and now he knows where i live. what if he came back. 

the only way to get around this is by not having alcohol (mind you im not getting drunk, a drink or 2. i keep my wits about me) and most guys schedules only allow time in the evening so a coffee date isn‚Äôt ideal i guess. just wondering if you have any ideas how to be less paranoid or if i should just not have anyone ever come pick me up lol!!

Whenever Windows does its ""background update"" process, everything slows down, and my computer seems starved for resources. Particularly, one specific resource - memory. From what I can tell, the rest of my build might be slightly outdated, but nothing that would bog down an OS this badly. The only thing I could think would be causing the problem, is if the old HDD isn't cutting it anymore.

So, I'm shopping around for an SSD. This is what I'm looking for. I need a drive that will:

1. Be reliable enough that I don't have to worry about it going out on me
2. (Hopefully) resolve my bottlenecking issue
3. Meet my storage needs (hoping for 1 TB space minimum)
4. Cost $100 or less

Pretty much in that order. But, if what I'm looking for just doesn't exist at that price point, I'll weigh my options on cost versus storage capacity. Points 1 and 2 are non-negotiable. I'm looking for a SATA drive that fits in the 3.5"" bay on my case. I'm not sure if my case supports other form factors, but if it does, I'd be open to giving one a try.

1g3xhxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1g3xhxy/postop_update_day_5/,Post-Op Update: Day 5,"
I started experiencing mild gallbladder symptoms last year. It rarely bothered me, but I consistently felt a slight pressure, like a thumb pressing where my gallbladder is located. In February 2024, after an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with multiple gallstones. Three different doctors recommended that I have my gallbladder removed. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt feel that my symptoms were severe enough to justify surgery. I‚Äôd heard stories of painful gallbladder attacks, which made me consider the surgery, but I kept thinking I could manage this discomfort without going under. I also worried about the possibility of an attack happening while I was away, like on vacation.

I made appointments with a surgeon three times, only to postpone them each time for various reasons. My last scheduled appointment was October 9th. On October 7th, I was thinking of canceling again, fully intending to call the doctor‚Äôs office the next day and reschedule.

But then, around 3 PM on October 7th, I experienced the worst pain of my life. It was indescribable‚Äîjust horrible‚Äîeven though I‚Äôd been careful with my diet. I ended up in the ER, and after receiving morphine and other painkillers, I finally felt some relief. By the time I left the hospital, it was the morning of October 8th, just a day before my scheduled surgery. At that point, I knew for sure: I wasn‚Äôt going to postpone it this time.

The surgery went ahead the next day. I experienced mild discomfort and about 4/10 pain for the first two days, but by day five, the pain had decreased to 2/10. I had my first bowel movement and was still dealing with gas and occasional shoulder pain, but overall, I‚Äôm glad the gallbladder is out. I was even able to drive to a coffee shop alone and grab a cup of coffee.

I didn‚Äôt experience any nausea or vomiting after the surgery, just some pain that was manageable.

Feel free to ask me any questions!

Hi everyone! I recently started as a social media comms coordinator for a university. I have honestly never had this type of job before and was shocked I managed to land it. 

I was expecting to have more guidance going into it, at least some SOPs but there are none. I feel completely lost. I have no defined tasks, I have to make it up as I go, and I have a student worker under me. 

My boss is clearly very overwhelmed and we have a very small team. She sends me various articles and things on 3 different platforms and I‚Äôm having a hard time keeping it all straight. 

Like today ‚Äî I had to give a presentation to another department with my team and my boss wasn‚Äôt there on Friday to help me or my colleague prepare (I had no idea she would be out). And I also needed to edit a video of the UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT (which is a huge deal) but I didn‚Äôt have time to because I suddenly had to prepare for this presentation. 

I am already inundated with emails from people needing me to do XY and Z for their department. I feel like I have no time to just focus on a single task and end up chasing my tail or doing too much research and getting nothing done. And then I have to find work for my student worker to do on top of it all. 

I‚Äôve been setting up coffee chats with my counterparts in other departments which are helpful but also difficult because they have bigger teams and bigger budgets for more sophisticated scheduling tools and apps. 

I don‚Äôt know what my priorities are and I feel like I‚Äôm failing. I don‚Äôt have a concrete set of tasks and I‚Äôm learning lots of new platforms and discovered today, I‚Äôve been using one completely wrong and have like 10 overdue tasks. 

I‚Äôm drowning and I don‚Äôt know what to do! I want to be good at this job but I feel massively underqualified and unprepared. Until now, I have been micromanaged in every job I‚Äôve ever had and now, it feels like I don‚Äôt have enough management. 

How do I set up a system to keep myself on track?

**What is ""Jason Hale - 2 Trades A Day""?**

""Jason Hale - 2 Trades A Day"" is a day trading course that teaches you how to trade emini futures in a simple, efficient way. The system promises you can make profits by placing just two trades each day within the first 90 minutes of the market opening. The best part? It‚Äôs designed to help you wrap up your trading before 11:00 a.m. EST, leaving you free for the rest of the day. Jason Hale, the course creator, guarantees that if you don‚Äôt make back the course fee ($495) in 20 consecutive trading days, you‚Äôll get a refund.

**Who is Jason Hale?**

Jason Hale is the man behind this system. He's been a part-time day trader since 2005 while still working a regular full-time job that he loves. Unlike many trading ‚Äúgurus,‚Äù Hale isn‚Äôt a millionaire or some trading wizard. Instead, he‚Äôs a regular guy who struggled with traditional investing and eventually found success in trading emini futures. His journey from learning the ropes of trading to refining a strategy that works for him is a big part of why this course feels approachable.

**Where does ""2 Trades A Day"" fit in?**

The strategy revolves around trading emini Dow futures, focusing on price action without relying on complicated indicators or fancy software. Hale‚Äôs experience watching these charts daily gave him insight into certain market patterns that he claims consistently repeat themselves. By following these patterns, he has built a 70%-80% profitable system.

This method appeals to traders who want to keep things simple: just two trades per day, a rule-based system, and no need to stay glued to your screen all day. You can even use any trading platform, so there's flexibility in how you trade.

**When can you expect results?**

Hale suggests that you‚Äôll likely start seeing results within the first 20 days of trading, given the 70%-80% profitability rate. He emphasizes that the system is built for the mornings, meaning you‚Äôre done trading by 11:00 a.m. EST (or earlier) most days. So, if you're someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be stuck at your computer all day but still wants to profit, this is designed for you.

**Why choose this course?**

Why choose ""Jason Hale - 2 Trades A Day""? Because it‚Äôs about simplicity and results. If you‚Äôre tired of overly complex trading strategies, this course breaks things down into a simple, manageable system. Plus, Hale has gone through the same struggles most beginner traders face‚Äîblowing money on educational resources that don‚Äôt pan out. With his method, the goal is to pocket a consistent profit daily without spending all day watching charts.

Also, the course fee is $495, which Hale claims you can earn back in one day if you‚Äôre trading multiple contracts. With no recurring fees or special software requirements, it‚Äôs a one-time investment, and you‚Äôre free to trade with whatever tools you prefer.

**How does it work?**

It works by following Hale‚Äôs rule-based system, which he honed over years of trial and error. The course comes with a concise e-manual and 10 instructional videos (plus live trading examples) to walk you through the process. You won‚Äôt need any fancy indicators‚Äîjust pure price action. Once you recognize the patterns Hale teaches, you‚Äôll enter and exit trades within minutes, all before most people have had their second cup of coffee.

**Final Thoughts**

""Jason Hale - 2 Trades A Day"" is a straightforward course for anyone who wants to simplify their trading. If you‚Äôre looking for a low-risk, repeatable system that gets you in and out of the market fast, this could be a great fit. It‚Äôs not about making millions overnight‚Äîit‚Äôs about slowly building consistent profits. If you‚Äôre a beginner or someone who‚Äôs tired of complicated trading strategies, Hale‚Äôs system might be worth a shot.",1,1728958754.0,ZaneStudying,1,1.0,False

I am your typical spider scared, yet made a friend the start of summer.

She‚Äôs my beloved yellow banana / garden spider- in TX named willow. 

I‚Äôve watched her for about 4 months now- shes moved webs a few times in the perimeter of the window. Beyond bug ethics (have thrown her a few live ones) - sprayed her web during the hot days - and gotten closer than I ever thought I would to a spider. 

After studying the life cycles and having a close eye- she hasn‚Äôt really been in a spot to be found by a mate and hasn‚Äôt left her web the whole mating season - I‚Äôve kept my eye out for tiny males but haven‚Äôt seen them come through. But, I got worried for a day when I came for for my typical morning coffee, smoke and gaze at her and she was gone for less than a day- then back to her web like clock work. 

I see eggs semi next to her in web hidden by the roof (I shooed off the lizard, also do they eat eggs?) 

Its still 90 degrees here in oct. - she should live technically till the frost, and even after the babies if those are her eggs? 

Yet she looks so lethargic‚Ä¶.
  I havent seen her eat, legs are shriveled, she looks so tiny compared to her usual, beautiful, glistening and bright self :( is she dying? How do ya‚Äôll cope and try to give them a happy life and help protect the eggs for her?

my chapter went through the typical ""big little dates"" process where actives reach out to PNM's/non-initiated girls to go on dates to see if we are compatible. We were supposed to go on THREE DATES. the first girl that contacted me and took me to a coffee shop did not connect or care about me at all. I was literally in the middle of telling her a story and she picks up her phone and goes on snapchat. I just stopped talking completely and about 45 seconds goes by just SILENT. so awkward and I wanted to cry. I was not contacted again by another girl so I just went on ONE date when I was supposed to go on THREE. What im trying to say is that I feel like I missed out being able to gauge compatibility with older girls. I had to put random names down on the ""big little preference"" google form because no one else contacted me. I got in touch with the New Member Experience Officer to tell her the situation but it was just too late since big/little reveal is on a schedule. 

Fast forward to big/little basket I just didn't feel known or seen. Idc about materialistic things but I told her my T shirt size on our ""big/little basket wants"" and she got me an XS for both of my shirts in my baskets. It just didn't feel good but I was trying to have a positive attitude. She made me a big lil instagram which was super funny and nice. 

  
Then big lil reveal happens. Everyone is screaming and crying and hugging and its so emotional but I literally just walked up to her and was like oh okay its nice to meet you! She had never met me before and never had a conversation with me before either. I felt like the whole thing was poorly organized and I just felt sad that I couldn't connect with her really. We went to a local bar restaurant with other big/lil and it was cool. Anyways, ever since then she does not text me or talk to me in real life at all really. She doesn't hang out with me at chapter or go out with me at night. She hangs out with her big at every tailgate/function/group hangout and does not ask me to do anything. I told my mom all of this and she tells me to make a move, so I do. I have asked probably 3 times to hang out and she tells me 1) no sorry I can't 2) im studying sorry or 3) I'm so tired. I just feel really uncared for and have cried a couple of times about it. I know it's not a huge deal but this was something I was really looking forward to about being in a sorority.

# Eating Habits During Weight Loss

I continued to eat foods generally considered refined and high-fat.

# Actions Taken for Weight Loss: Reading and Watching YouTube

When I decided to lose weight, the first thing I did was to understand why people gain weight. Every book and every person has their own perspective. I aimed to comprehensively understand the process to avoid unnecessary effort and suffering.

In the first half-year, I set a general direction and gradually filled in the complete concept, establishing my own personal theory. Summarizing it, the three weight loss theories that influenced me the most are:

1. **Ketogenic Theory + Insulin Theory**: People can use fats as body energy, so you can live well even without eating carbs.
2. **Gut Bacteria Theory**: Everyone‚Äôs gut bacteria are different, so even if you eat the same food, the calories and nutrients absorbed will differ.
3. **Cellular Metabolism Theory**: The ability to use fats as body energy is related to breathing habits, cell lipid composition, and the number of mitochondria.

The order of these three theories happens to be ‚Äúfrom surface problem to root cause.‚Äù If the fundamental functions (gut bacteria imbalance or cellular metabolism imbalance) are damaged, solving the surface problem and implementing the correct diet (low carbs, low sugar) will yield half the results with twice the effort. Conversely, if the fundamental functions are intact, merely changing the surface lifestyle slightly will quickly restore normal functions and reduce unnecessary fat.

# Things to Practice for Weight Loss ‚Äî Categorized by the Three Theories

During 2020‚Äì2022, since I did not exercise at all, I did not practice the third-level ‚ÄúCellular Metabolism Theory.‚Äù During this period, I only practiced the actions required by the ‚ÄúKetogenic Theory + Insulin Theory‚Äù and the ‚ÄúGut Bacteria Theory.‚Äù

Since each of these three theories is a vast topic, I decided to write down the practices and their associated theories in this first article, then explore the principles and reasons behind them in three subsequent articles. Below is a summary of the key points to practice for weight loss, listed in order of importance:

# Ketogenic Theory + Insulin Theory

>**Core Concept**: Make the body lack carbs for a long time and use fats as energy. Eat more Omega 3, eat fewer carbs.

**‚úÖ Things to Do:**

* **Reduce carbs**: Lower the amount of starch (to the point where starch is a side dish), eat more protein and healthy fats, don‚Äôt use fruits as meal replacements, and if you want to eat sweets, eat them after meals.
* **Long periods without eating**: Practice fasting, avoid eating late at night (can eat after meals), and avoid snacking between meals (can eat after meals).
* **Lower insulin**: Fast, reduce starch, eat vegetables and meat before starch, avoid prolonged sitting, stand or walk occasionally, drink apple cider vinegar.
* **Increase Omega 3, reduce Omega 6**: Eat fewer processed foods that can be stored at room temperature for 1 year, eat more whole foods that can only be stored for 1 day at room temperature, choose healthy fats.

**‚ùå Things Not to Do:**

* **Exercise more**: If you want to exercise, walking or climbing 2‚Äì4 flights of stairs is enough.
* **Eat less**: The only things to eat less of are starch and refined sugars. Barbecue, steak, and fine dining can be eaten freely. Fried foods have long-term effects (due to more Omega 6), so you can still eat them occasionally but not often. Long periods without eating (fasting) are far more effective than eating less.
* **Drink more water**: Drink water moderately; your body will know when you need it.

Note that ‚Äúfasting‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúeating less.‚Äù

# Gut Bacteria Theory

>**Core Concept**: Gut bacteria directly affect the nutrients and blood sugar levels you absorb. Increase good bacteria, reduce bad bacteria. If you have more good bacteria, your ‚Äúfat gain defense‚Äù will be stronger.

**‚úÖ Things to Do:**

* **Increase good bacteria**: Eat more fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, yogurt, apple cider vinegar, or foods containing polyphenols like red wine and dark chocolate. Eat fiber-rich foods like vegetables, and take probiotics.
* **Reduce bad bacteria**: If your gut bacteria are already imbalanced, see a doctor, and reduce the frequency of eating fast food and fried foods.

**‚ùå Things Not to Do:**

* **Eat only meat and fats**: If you follow the ‚ÄúKetogenic Theory + Insulin Theory,‚Äù some people completely avoid starch and fiber, causing fiber-eating good bacteria in the gut to become extinct. These people may need to stay on keto for life, otherwise, they will easily regain weight.
* **Take antibiotics arbitrarily**: Antibiotics are like a nuclear bomb for gut bacteria, wiping out both good and bad bacteria. If you have to take them, remember to supplement with probiotics afterward.

# Cellular Metabolism Theory

>**Core Concept**: Obesity and cancer are metabolic diseases. Maintaining cellular metabolic health is the true core of longevity and staying in shape.

**‚úÖ Things to Do:**

* **Get your heart rate to 120‚Äì140**: Strictly speaking, it‚Äôs 70‚Äì80% of your maximum heart rate, which can effectively train mitochondria. You can do weight training, slow jogging, or even ultra-slow jogging ‚Äî as long as it achieves this effect, it‚Äôs effective training.
* **Practice ‚ÄúKetogenic Theory + Insulin Theory‚Äù and ‚ÄúGut Bacteria Theory‚Äù**: If obesity is caused by not following these two theories, it‚Äôs ultimately due to damaging the cell mitochondria‚Äôs metabolic ability. By properly practicing the elements in these theories, you can reduce the chances of damaging metabolic ability.
* **Avoid over-breathing**: Breathe through your nose, and practice breath-holding.

**‚ùå Things Not to Do:**

* **Intense exercise**: Heart rate reaching 180‚Äì200 is intense exercise, which is beyond the range for training mitochondria and is very tiring.

# Implementation: What I Did from 2020 to 2022

Since the above are relatively conceptual theories, you might not know where to start. I‚Äôll share what I actually did during the main weight loss period ‚Äî from 2020 to 2022 ‚Äî as a reference for those who want to try.

# First Half of 2020

At the beginning of researching weight loss topics, my concepts were very superficial, so I only did the following:

**‚úÖ Things Done:**

1. Ate vegetables first, then meat, and finally rice or bread during meals.
2. Stood often while working, making the most of time that could be spent standing.
3. Occasionally took a 15‚Äì20 minute walk after lunch.
4. Avoided starch in regular meals as much as possible, treating starch as a side dish (not restricted during gatherings).
5. Drank unsweetened coffee or tea in the afternoon instead of sugary drinks.
6. Set monthly goals, roughly aiming to lose 1kg per month.
7. Weighed myself daily to thoroughly understand the conditions under which weight changes.

**‚ùå Things Not Done:**

1. **Did not quit drinking**: For a period, I made Gin Fizz, Negroni, and Daiquiri cocktails every day.
2. **Did not exercise**: Completely avoided exercising.
3. **Did not reduce social dining**: Always attended and ate at feasts if necessary.

# Entire Year of 2021

After reading more weight loss theories, I found that some people opposed keto, saying it leads to easy weight regain. Some also said keto wasn‚Äôt effective for them. After diving deeper into why, I adjusted my approach:

**‚úÖ Things Done (in addition to previous practices):**

1. Took probiotics, drank apple cider vinegar, and drank perilla oil.
2. Opted for fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and kombucha when dining out, and also ordered vegetables or salads.
3. Paid attention to the oils used in foods ‚Äî reducing intake if they were high in Omega 6.
4. Occasionally skipped breakfast or ate less for breakfast, only eating vegetables and eggs instead of bread.
5. Occasionally fasted ‚Äî extending periods without eating when possible.
6. Monitored heart rate ‚Äî noticing prolonged sitting lowered it to 65‚Äì68, standing occasionally raised it to 80, avoiding long periods with a heart rate around 65.

**‚ùå Things Not Done:**

1. **Did not eat less meat or fatty meat**: As I categorized meat fats as harmless, I did not care if I ate fatty beef or pork. Regularly ate barbecue, steak, lamb chops, tuna belly, and occasionally fried chicken.
2. **Did not eat less or count calories**: Did not care about ‚Äúfood calories,‚Äù focusing more on whether it was starch. Though I often fasted, I might eat a lot for dinner.

# First Half of 2022

During this period, I wanted to see six-pack abs without exercising, solely through weight loss. A health check revealed liver shadows (initially suspected to be liver disease), prompting two more actions:

**‚úÖ Things Done (in addition to previous practices):**

1. Quit drinking.
2. Practiced breath-holding and controlled breathing.

As a result, weight dropped quickly, reaching around 71kg by June 2022, with a feeling of malnutrition. At this stage, I thought I could start gaining weight again, marking the end of my weight loss journey. From the second half of 2022, I stopped caring about weight and let it naturally return to 74kg.

From January 2023, feeling that weight loss was sufficient (having proven that diet adjustment alone can lead to weight loss without exercise), I started working out to gain muscle, joining a gym program. The goal remains six-pack abs üòÇ. Currently, progress is still far off; after six months, the result is -3kg of fat and +3kg of muscle. The future is uncertain, and I don‚Äôt know what the outcome will be next year.

# Conclusion

Since starting my weight loss journey, I‚Äôve wanted to organize and share my knowledge of ‚Äúobesity‚Äù and weight loss theories. Obesity is not just a matter of appearance; it hides underlying metabolic and inflammation issues, which are factors behind diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, Alzheimer‚Äôs, cataracts, cancer, etc.

Sometimes things aren‚Äôt that difficult; it‚Äôs just that we have incorrect knowledge and use the wrong methods, making the process harder. By understanding the principles of weight gain more comprehensively, we can avoid many detours and achieve twice the results with half the effort.",0,1728958010.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,0.5,False

1g3x1ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/1g3x1ix/help_decipheringaddressing_isfj_romantic_interest/,Help deciphering/addressing ISFJ romantic interest,"I (39M), an INTJ, have been having a secret crush on an ISFJ (35F) for several months now.

We met in late May this year, and have been hanging out once every week or two, unless one of us is travelling for work. When we hang out, for drinks or lunch, or doing stuff or chatting, she says that time goes by really fast. It does for me too. When we're together, I'd like to think we get along well. She's jokingly called me her husband a few times, and I've responded jokingly calling her my wife. Sometimes, if I have to go to a work thing (or not) after hanging out, I notice that she'd always help me groom by straightening my suit or fixing my hair (which I've expressed that I appreciate). At least twice, I've heard her say she loves (using specifically that word) me, but not directly to my face and kind of passively. The first time this happened was a bit after she jokingly said we're married. Of course, I'm also aware that there are different degrees of ""love.""

For my part, I bring her her favorite coffee every so often. I also try to let her know that I'm there for her and she's in my thoughts. She hates travelling for work, and whenever she needs to do so, I'll send her a note the morning before she leaves to wish her a safe trip and to hang in there. Once, she was saying how she was really tired because she had to walk around the entire day before, so I sat her down and gave her a foot massage. She's said she appreciates these gestures. I've told her that I like her, although never expressing the degree of ""like."" In my heart, I'm pretty sure I love her.

On the other hand, when we're apart, there's a bit of radio silence. I'm the one who typically initiates the hanging out. If we're not coordinating hanging out, we maybe exchange texts only every 6-10 days. Sometimes, we'd have an extended text conversation (over the course of 1-3 hours); but othertimes, I get one word responses (which makes me feel like I'm bothering her). Other times, the texts get really flirtatious, like once when I asked how she was doing, she responded that she wasn't doing well because she misses me. At the start, I used to be the one initiating all the texting, but she's been doing it more and more lately.

What, I guess, taints the whole equation is how we met. My employer is a client of her employer (which I recently learnt she owns a significant stake in). She's in sales/marketing and I'm in legal. Somehow, we hit it off when we met in May, but part of me keeps wondering if she knows I like her and is just being nice (or even worse, manipulative) because of the relationship of our respective employers. If so, I'd rather not be a nuisance to her.

Most recently, we were texting while she was on another business trip, and she said she was planning to take some time off in later this year for her birthday. I asked what she wanted for her birthday, and after she told me what she wanted, she added ""I guess I should spend my birthday with you."" I agreed to spend her birthday with her, but in retrospect, I don't know if I should take the ""I guess"" as some sort of hesitation, or a hint that she wants to spend her birthday with me (this was via text, so no vocal cues).

How do I interpret all of the above? Is this typical for an ISFJ? Is all the joking and flirting her way of hinting that I should make a move, seal the deal, and make our relationship official? Are the periodic one-word text responses, ""I guesses,"" etc, indicative of how she really feels, and hinting that I should back off? Am I overanalyzing/strategizing this?

I've fallen hard for her. She's been travelling for business about two weeks now, and I can't keep her out of my mind. I've even written poetry about how much I miss her (which I've not shared). Of course, if she wants me to go away, I'll respect her wishes, lick my wounds and disappear. But if there's some sort of future, I'd like to not screw it up and approach this in the best way possible. 

So, ISFJ collective, thoughts?

P.S. Yes, I know INTJs and ISFJs are far from the best in compatability, but I actually get along with Fes very well. When I care about someone, I'm very aware of their feelings, and provide emotional support where needed. But I also have an inherent instinct to try and come up with a solution to the problem, in addition to doing so, which is the telltale Te in me.",2,1728957906.0,isfj,1,1.0,False

I couldn‚Äôt tell you the first time it happened and I wish I could tell you the final time it will happen.

A boy who would appear to be maybe twelve or so rides on an old rusty bike and tosses the paper with such precision, one could assume he‚Äôd have a promising career with the Boston Red Sox. Heck, he‚Äôd probably soar in the NFL too. But something was seriously off about ‚Äúthe kid.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt show up every single morning. But when he came, you knew it. You could hear his rusty bike chain struggling. It was as if the noise itself was elevated by invisible speakers. He would throw the paper dead center of everyone‚Äôs door step.

The paper didn‚Äôt have a name such as The New York Times or whatever your hometown has. It was just simply blank. 

I remember the first paper I got. I woke up extremely tired from a sleepless night, I brewed some coffee and opened the door to see the leaves falling. That‚Äôs when I seen the paper. 

‚ÄúLocal restaurant closes down today.‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt think much of it, restaurants close all the time. It‚Äôs one of the hardest businesses to maintain. It wasn‚Äôt until I pulled up to my favorite Chinese restaurant that they announced on the door they were closed for good, no explanation. 

Months go by and I seen him riding down to the next house on the street. I picked up the paper again.

‚ÄúDrunk driver crashes today.‚Äù Sure enough, a man in our town drove his car into a used car lot, damaging one that was for sale. The man was over double the legal limit according to my cousin who is a cop. 

Six months go by and another one.

‚ÄúJacob dies by stabbing.‚Äù There‚Äôs a lot of people named Jacob. Many of those people I‚Äôm sure were superstitious and stayed in home that day. The news crew were outside someone‚Äôs home and said it was an active crime scene. They never did find who did it. 

At least a year went by when I heard the bike peddling again. I ran outside and the paper landed at my feet.

‚ÄúFull moon tonight, Be cautious.‚Äù A homeless person was mutilated in the park. They believed it to be some sort of wild animal. 

The rest of the paper everytime was like any other. Filled with weather and advertisements. No one ever tried to stop the paperboy to my knowledge .

Four months go by and I see him peddling, I jog towards him.

‚ÄúHey! Quit sending out these papers! Please.‚Äù 

He turned his head and spoke back to me. I could have sworn his eyes were pitch black.

‚ÄúJust doing my job, I don‚Äôt write these.‚Äù The paper went dead center of my porch step. 

‚ÄúFactory supervisor involved in terrible accident.‚Äù 

I wasn‚Äôt at work for fifteen minutes when people began freaking out. A temp on a forklift collided with one of our supervisors and he was impaled. He died before the ambulance sirens lit up the rainy parking lot. 

I don‚Äôt know what made me think it was a great idea, but a year and a half goes by when I spotted him again. I charged towards him on his bike and he tossed a paper so hard, it knocked me flat on my back.

‚ÄúJust wait until you get the next one! You‚Äôll regret doing that.‚Äù 

I sat up and looked at the paper. ‚ÄúBody found with all blood gone.‚Äù The town mayor was found with bite marks on his neck. All the blood on his body was drained. 

I lived in paranoia the entire day wondering what he meant. A day goes by when the paperboy came back.

‚ÄúTim gets what he deserved.‚Äù Shit, that‚Äôs me. 

I run back in the house and lock the door when I heard an audible voice. 

‚ÄúYou think you can avoid this?‚Äù

A man comes from my kitchen. He‚Äôs wearing black pants and a white dress shirt. He‚Äôs wearing a fedora and black suspenders. He was straightened his tie. His eyes were pitch black and the smell of rotting eggs filled the room. 

His arms stretched from across the room and grabbed me by my throat.  He picked me up and slammed me against my ceiling and dropped me to my hardwood floor. He picked up my couch and threw it on top of me. I tried to crawl away when I felt his arms start wrapping around my neck as if they were a snake squeezing the life out of its dinner. 

He flipped me around and opened his mouth. Razor sharp teeth similar to a sharks plunged into my shoulder. I let out a scream and tried throwing a punch but was too weak. 

I woke up in the hospital. My neighbor heard all the commotion and left, he explained he seen a well dressed man walking down the street and finding me in a puddle of my blood. They didn‚Äôt have any trouble believing him. 

Once I made it home, I stumbled to the porch and seen another paper on my step.

‚ÄúLocal paper closing down once a sacrifice is made.‚Äù This time there were words below the headline.

‚ÄúFellow citizens of this great community, it is with our deepest regret to inform you that we decided to close shop under one specific condition. The condition being that you all choose one person to sacrifice. The decision is up to you all by majority vote. We have plans to set up shop in another town somewhere we choose not to share at the time. However, failure to pick a sacrifice will result in daily paper deliveries, many more creative than the next. Every childless adult is required to attend.‚Äù 

I never seen town hall so full of people and such chaos. Of course no one volunteered, the person was selected after people took their turns speaking. Every business was closed down that day. The person chosen was a man in jail for producing and dealing meth. 

He didn‚Äôt know what was happening when he was walked in front of all of us. I still hear his voice say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

The officer said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù 

BANG

we never did get anymore papers delivered, but the guilt has clearly eaten up this city. 

I‚Äôm not sure if they planned on coming to your town or whoever‚Äôs town. But I am completely convinced they cannot be stopped.

*  It's her 1st vlog since she moved into her new house.

*  We're doing a Walmart haul and then we're making iced coffee.  Shakes coke zero at the camera.  Goes on an extended rant about how fat she is and how she's now sticking to carnivore (didn't she say this in like every single one of her videos over the last two months?) and she went on a carb binge and now she really has to buckle down.

*  Ted is the sweetest man on earth in case you were wondering.

*  Continues bitching about the fact that nothing is taking off the 20 lbs she gained.  (pssst, cunty, here's a tip:  it's because you got depressed and literally starved yourself to take that last 30 lbs off.  You will probs have to starve yourself again to get back to where you were.)

*  They're gonna grill chicken.  She bought microwave potatoes and a can of green beans for Trevor.   She also bought Halloween themed socks.  Shakes pumpkin spice Torani syrup at the camera.

*  Shows the red room which is not finished and full of boxes.  There's a motorcycle engine in the doorway to the purple room.  She bought a dozen roses for Todrick because he's the best ever, most wonderful person ever and she loves him sooooo much!!!  Trent is just the best man ever!!!  She knows she's gushing about Troy but they've had sooooo many beautiful moments she just feels loved and really in love.

*  Shakes a travel mug at the camera.  She has a bag of ice from the moving party.  Color of the day is purple.  Shows the cat's ear eye makeup.  Pans out to show her so-called outfit of the day which consists of a tee (that's getting a tad tight around the middle), that ratty sweater, black shorts and tights with a giant hole in one leg.  Tres chic.

*  Shakes cold brew coffee at the camera.  She's measuring everything for her coffee.  (new stage of her ED unlocked.)  Dogs are barking to go out.  She's super happy to toss their little fuzzy butts out the door.

*  She has chores to do.  Wash dishes.  ""It's not that bad, really it's not.""  (lol)  They use paper plates and she doesn't feel guilty about that.   She has to vacuum, do laundry, make the bed and when that's done, she's gonna marinate chicken.

*  Segue to the green room.  Taz is gonna be home soon and she has to get the chicken going.  (How did she waste an entire day on the teeny amount of chores she claims to have done?)

*  Shows the kitchen.  She loves the floor.  Yapping about wall hangings.

*  Tiberius told Cunty that he was worried the house wasn't going to be good enough for her.  (Oh Tom, you poor, sad man.  If you lived in a 2 room shanty with an outhouse, but had a fenced in yard, she'd still have grifted her way into that.)  She can't believe he would say that!!!  She would live in a dirt floor hut full of motorcycle engines for the love of her mayun.  She says she's never gonna stop gushing over Tim.  Not sorry.

*  Shows her trashed ""office.""  Looks like it did in her old apt.  (And it will continue to look that way because she's a lazy fuck.)

*  Onto the laundry room.  It's a storage cabinet.  Apparently it's no longer her closet.  (She must have made Trent throw out his collection of Carhartt cut-offs and stole his closet.)  She put a pair of freaking drapes at the laundry room window lol.

*  Pans to the purple room with the blue door.  Nothing matches and it looks kinda hideous.  Skeevin's coat rack front and center lol.

*  Pans to the bedroom with that flat-ass 'comforter' that has absolutely no stuffing left in it and she put up hideous sage green blackout curtains which do not match at all.  The bedroom is super small, no idea why they didn't use the 'office' as the master????  Tucker bought what looks like an indoor/outdoor no nap rug for in front of the bed.  Cheapest thing ever.   Wait, she says the curtains are teal and they're gonna paint the room teal.  Pans to the closet (which I totally called it) which her and Trog are gonna share.

*  She's so happy to be with Tripp and in her new house and he's so amazing and he fixes things and omg what a man what a man what a mighty good man, say it again y'all.

*  She's back in the kitchen making chicken rub.  Trent walks in and says he's the night stalker.  She breaks to greet Topher.  She wanted to get the chicken marinated earlier but she's has SUCH A BUSY DAY of fucking around reading the snark sub.  (Must be it because it literally takes less than an hour to do the few things she said she needed to do.)

*  Segue to the back yard where Torrance has put an [old door across a chair and a log](https://imgur.com/a/affh1Lo) to put his little grill on.   Trevor says ""it's better than what we had.""    She says this is a member's vlog so only members can see.  Yup Ok.

*  Trent attempts to set fire to the lawn.

*  Pans to the neighbor's dog that Morty and Bella like.  Tucker goes to see him.

*  Thor says he should use the lid with chicken.  Cunty says no.  Bad choice because they're burning the shit out of this chicken.  ""It's a learning experience.""  (apparently not, you ridiculous twat.  You ppl have been grilling for like 3 months and STILL haven't managed not to incinerate every fucking thing you eat.)

*  Tad is riding a bicycle around the back yard.  Cunty wants him to buy her a bike so they can ride to together.  Back to the chicken.  Tod takes their temperature.  Between 180&deg;-220&deg; lol.  Over-baked and dry as a bone sort of like Cunty when she's off the booze.

*  Back in the kitchen, she's gonna mic Todd's potatoes.  Screams because she ripped the film.  Trevor is hanging up pictures.  He puts on music.  It's super loud.  Trevor does pull ups.

*  Plays Santana, Cunty mentions copyright.  Cunty is making garlic toast out of a hamburger bun.

*  Cunty sings Tangled Up in Blue as sung by Jerry Garcia.  She is completely out of tune.  You can tell she's stoned out of her mind.  It's taking her an extended amount of time to butter bread.  Singing off tune and off pitch (""Fuck the copyright!!"") and rambling about nothing.

*  Tuna walks into the green room wearing a day-glo orange rain jacket for unknown reasons.

*  She says she's ""a little high"" off the CBD gummies.  (called it!!)    Says her chicken is delish.  Tadeus likes the potatoes.

*  Outro of Trevor burning chicken.  No good-bye or fuck you.  Just gone.",6,1728957376.0,Lifepluscindy_snark,2,0.88,False

IQ Blast Pro¬†is an effective dietary supplement with potent natural ingredients that can address the real cause of cognitive decline. Studies reveal that NEUROTOXIN is the main culprit that causes brain inflammation and affects the overall health of the brain functions.

* We've both visited a couple times already so we're skipping a lot of the first-time visitor activities.
* Our main reason for visiting is to see musicals/plays. We're going to be rushing/lotto/TKTS booth for days/times there is a performance for which we don't already have something lined-up. Therefore, I figured this aspect will limit us geographically for non-theatre activities, but maybe I'm being too time-concious.
* We will be taking the subway/walking and staying at a hotel near Midtown.

Friday

* 8 AM - Arrive at JFK 
* \~10 AM - Drop off luggage at hotel
* 11 AM - Citizens of Chelsea
* Early Afternoon - Strand Bookstore
* 4:45 PM - Ichibantei
* 7 PM - McNeal
* 9:30 PM - Gray's Papaya (Despite having visited multiple times previously I have yet to try this and I figured we'll be close since McNeal is at the Lincoln Center it would be a decent time to check it out)

Saturday (Our morning plans are loose bc it highly depends on our lotto/rush outcome, I guess a pessimist because I've planned for us to check out the Lincolnn Center TKTS Booth)

* \~9 AM - Black Press Coffee/Central Park (if we don't rush)
* 10/11 AM - TKTS Booth Lincoln Center
* ? - Nothing planned (See above)
* 2 PM - Show TBD (No matter what we will be seeing something lol)
* \~5 PM - Quick dinner in the area (We're thinking Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles, Vito's Silces and Ices, or Juniors)
* 7 PM - Tammy Faye

Sunday (Again the morning plans are not set in stone but we'd have to check the Times Square TKTS Booth since the Lincoln Center location is closed on Mondays)

* \~9 AM - Russ & Daughters
* 10/11 AM - TKTS Booth Times Square
* 12 PM - Whitney Museum (Potentially something we could do on Monday)
* 3 PM - Show TBD (No matter what we will be seeing something lol)
* \~6:30/7 PM - Han Dynasty
* After dinner - Don't Tell Mama (The other option was Marie's Crisis Cafe but Don't Tell Mama is closer to our hotel)

Monday

* \~9 AM - Seven Grams Caffe
* 10 AM - High Line (One of the few major tourist attractions I haven't done)
* 11:30 AM - Gammeeok
* 1:30/2 PM - Spyscape Museum (I haven't reserved this yet but I was thinking this would be a good time this day to go)
* \~4/5 PM - Lupa
* 7 PM - Show TBD (This depends on what shows we see the previous two days since there are only 2 shows this day we're really interested in)

Tuesday (My flight is in the evening and my friend's is early morning so I will be on my own for the day and  unfortunately there is no time to see a show. I was planning on hanging out around LES/SoHo/Chinatown for the day and dropping off my luggage nearby at one of those luggage storage places)

* \~9 AM - B&H Dairy
*  10:30 AM - Laduree & Matcha Cafe (If time permits)
* \~12 PM - Tonii's Fresh Rice Noodle (Might just grab this right before heading to JFK, depends if I'm hungry for lunch)
* Pop in to Bluestockings Cooperative Bookstore?
* 1:30 PM - Tenement Museum Apartment Tour
* 4 PM - Head to JFK (I want to be at JFK \~2.5 hrs before my flight and I'm expecting \~1 hr commute via subway/AirTrain)

I didn't plan for sit-down breakfasts because of the volalitily of our schedule and I expect high wait times on the weekends. Am I over/underestimating the commute time between activities or how much time I've alloted for them? TIA!

I can‚Äôt post anon in my fb mom groups anymore because my husband will see them. 

I have been with my husband since I was 16 turning 17. I am 25 now and he is 27. So, 9 years. We have 4 kids, ages 6,4,3,1. I stay home with them. My oldest is in kindergarten. I take on 95% of the child rearing, housework and all the mental load. This past year I have been giving myself breaks. I will leave for an hour if I absolutely have to, will run and grab a coffee, will do what I need when I need now. 

This is where I feel like I‚Äôm crazy. I have been the one who wakes up every night for the past 6 years with the babies. I have done all the grunt work for raising the babies. Up until this year, I was the only one doing their basic care, teaching them how to have manners and just being humans basically. This year my husband has helped more but I still do 95% of the parenting. He works m-f about 8-9 hour days. He lets me have his paychecks for bills and usually after everything is paid, on good weeks there‚Äôs about 200 left over in which I‚Äôll spend some and use the rest for fast food/necessities. 

I did not want a traditional relationship. I wanted a partner who was involved and did 50/50 after they got home from work. I‚Äôm never celebrated on any holiday not even my birthday. I can count two times in 9 years where he got me something. He‚Äôs not romantic, we don‚Äôt spend quality time together, I have to ask for chores to get done and help with the kids because he won‚Äôt take initiative on his own. I had to enforce him to want to get married. He is content. If he doesn‚Äôt have to put in effort, he won‚Äôt. Now, he‚Äôs not a bag guy to me, but we‚Äôre basically living as roommates at this point. Every night as soon as the kids fall asleep, he gets on his game for 3-6 hours depending on the time. We NEVER spend time together. He is always stressed with the kids, or life in general. I made a pinky promise to have s*x with him and when the time came for me to go to bed, I was practically sleeping as I stood. He hurried off his game and asked me a few times if we were and I just had no interest. There‚Äôs never any foreplay or after care. I was hoping he‚Äôd get the hint and didn‚Äôt so we had sex. I silently cried while doing it because I just wanted to sleep. I have the weight of the world on me and I didn‚Äôt want to. We got done and he immediately got back on the game and I just silently ran upstairs and just started hyperventilating and ripping my clothes off to put on my nightgown. I felt just used. He didn‚Äôt intend for that, just how it felt on my end. How can my marriage succeed when I feel this way? He‚Äôs my best friend but I‚Äôm no one anymore. I feel crazy because what if my life really isn‚Äôt that bad?? What if I‚Äôm being ungrateful? What if it could be worse? I feel genuinely crazy anymore because I‚Äôm questioning my marriage.

My work is aware I have EDS and shoulder injury; management believes me, but my older coworkers always comment how I‚Äôm too young for this kinda thing etc (24 while they‚Äôre in late 40s, early 50s I think). 
They have made comments on me taking my breaks or sitting to rest (such as me bringing a chair in to sit so residents can see me as I do work I can sit for or into the kitchen/dining as I wait for them to finish meals and clear plates). I don‚Äôt pay mind to it. 
I haven‚Äôt ever used braces. The most they see is me icing my shoulder on break as I generally don‚Äôt like..looking disabled which is ableism I‚Äôve spent a long time working on. I use compression gear but over past 2/3 months it has become not enough support. 
I bit the bullet on some braces to hopefully stop rolling my one ankle, support my shoulder more so I‚Äôm not needing to ice an hour into working (this type had been brought up by my previous physiotherapist before along with one other I will try if it doesn‚Äôt help), an SI hip brace I‚Äôve seen in posts that has helped some with subluxation, and ring splints for one hand (if they work I will get some for my other). 
They come Wednesday and I work the weekend. They‚Äôre Amazon versions as I don‚Äôt want to drop too much till I know whether it works or not. How did y‚Äôall introduce wearing braces (i think only the shoulders won‚Äôt be super visible) at work. 

Did you just say nothing? Do you answer questions? Just preface it? I know residents will have questions and don‚Äôt mind that but I‚Äôm worried about my coworkers getting snide or complaining to management (as they‚Äôve complained about me taking my coffee breaks, moving the chair, or using one of the ice packs or even bringing my own).

I want a divorce. I just cannot seem to get those 4 words out of my mouth. 

Let me start off by saying I love my husband, but I am no longer in love with him. He is an amazing Father and provider, but he is no longer a romantic partner to me. Hasn‚Äôt been in years.

There is no infidelity. No fights/arguments (we rarely fight). Nothing catastrophic that has happened. We have just been platonic or ‚Äúroom mates‚Äù for quite some time. There is zero passion. We still have sex, but again, no passion. Feels very routine or we are just trying to ‚Äúget off‚Äù. We are comfortable.

Divorce has always been a back thought of mine, and I never wanted to leave because we have two children. But last week the smallest incident happened that just made something ‚Äúsnap‚Äù in my brain. The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back you could say.

Last week, my husband and my son were out running errands. I called him asking if he could pick up my coffee order since they were driving right by it. He was irritated, I had to beg for him to do it. Begrudgingly, he did. Got home, and my son carried my drink and set it on a ledge. My husband bumped it and it spilled everywhere. He lost his shit. He has always had a bad temper but for some reason, I looked at him in that moment and just thought‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúWhat am I doing here?‚Äù 

Ever since that day, I cannot stop thinking about finally pulling the trigger. I have consulted with several friends of mine, balled my eyes out, did a lot of self reflecting, and I cannot shake the feeling. I feel completely suffocated. 

I just know saying this to him will DESTROY him. He will be blindsided. I know he loves me, and I do truly love him as a person. But I cannot live this lie anymore. He will leave for work trips, and I feel like I can breathe when he‚Äôs gone. I take my kids out to do fun things on the weekends, and when he doesn‚Äôt want to join us (which is most of the time) I am relieved. We haven‚Äôt been on a date just the two of us in over a year. He hasn‚Äôt bought me flowers or a surprise anything in YEARS. I went out with some friends over the weekend, and I had to ask for him to tell me that I looked pretty. It is all so forced. I think he is okay with how things are. I mean, after all we are still having sex. But romantically it is completely DEAD. 

Now back to where I started, I want a divorce. I don‚Äôt know how to even begin this conversation. My biggest fear is his temper. I am afraid of him. When he gets angry, he almost ‚Äúblacks out‚Äù. Breaks things, punches holes in walls, screams, ect. He has never hit me and I don‚Äôt think he would, but who‚Äôs to say this conversation wouldn‚Äôt send him over the edge?

When we were young and dating, he put his gun to his head during an argument. One time when we were married he called the police because he was scared he ‚Äúmight do something stupid‚Äù. And to this day (it was actually recent), he will make jokes saying ‚ÄúIf you cheat/leave me. I will in fact kill you. I could easily hide your body.‚Äù Joking or not, with his temper and history I would be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt scare me a little bit. 

I‚Äôm sorry this was so long of a read. My biggest hurdle is getting the words out. I feel like once that is done, the hardest part is over. So I think I am looking for advice from those who have maybe been in a similar situation. 

I love him. I do not want to hurt him. I want to be as amicable as possible (I don‚Äôt want to go to court, fight for custody, child support, ect.) But I also don‚Äôt want to live like this for the rest of my life. We BOTH deserve to one day have a partner who loves and treats us the way we want to be loved.

It was a last minute thing as she was only in town for the weekend (lived 1-2hrs away). I suggested we just grab a quick coffee before she leaves, but she floated going to a Halloween event. I'd been wanting to go to this, so I agreed and paid for the $100 ticket (she bought hers luckily).

We met, she didn't look much like her photos. Looked like she could use a shower, and she didn't really dress up at all, and her personality was somewhat... abrasive. I realized quickly I wasn't romantically interested in her, but tried to stay positive, we could still enjoy the event even as friends. I was never rude or anything, tried to treat her like a person and be polite, make conversation etc. She was on her phone for 80% of the night texting someone. She was also a smoker which I can't stand, and she said she was legally married/separated to ""the asshole"" as she called her husband/ex. Despite the turn offs I thought we got along decently as friends, it's not like there was any friction.

Towards the end of the night she went for a smoke. She told me to get in line for a ride we wanted to do, and she'd catch up to me, I could save her spot. 20 minutes later I was about to go in, texted her, she replied she might not make it and to just go ahead without her, so I did. Afterwards I texted her saying it was done, and I was now on a bench in front of this shop. She didn't reply for 15-20 minutes, so I went home. I never heard back from her, lol.",0,1728955115.0,offmychest,1,0.5,False

Don‚Äôt know how to go on. ,"My mother passed away suddenly 5 months ago, she was 62 and was well up until an undiagnosed leg DVT traveled to her lung one day while she was in town. 

She was out shopping and suddenly felt a pain in her chest and was breathless and lightheaded. She sat down on a bench and called me. Within 10 minutes I had met her and we went to A&E where they did tests and diagnosed a PE (pulmonary embolism). It was quite large and so a fast acting clot busting drug was advised, it was administered in A&E that evening and she was transferred to a ward in the early hours for observation with 24 hours strict bed rest due to bleed risk and to continue treatment with more blood thinners. 

I phoned the ward mid morning for an update and was told that my mother was fine and to just come back over to the hospital for normal visiting time 2pm-4pm. 

On arrival at 2pm we found my mother sat in the chair beside her bed, she hadn‚Äôt been in the bed at all and wasn‚Äôt being monitored. She was being sick and was drowsy. We questioned straight away and were told that the doctor had said that she should be mobile and that they had no concerns. We asked to speak to a doctor and were told they would be around to speak to us soon. Hours passed, we kept asking and waiting to see a doctor, but nurses kept saying everything was fine and the doctor would see us soon. Afternoon visiting ended at 4pm, we stayed until nearly 5pm hoping to see the doctor but were firmly told to leave and come back at 6pm for evening visiting, so not wanting to upset staff and be removed we went for a coffee and waited in the hospital foyer until 6pm. 

On arriving back on the ward I found my mother‚Äôs condition was still very poor. We hadn‚Äôt been able to hold a conversation with her since arriving at 2pm, she had become barely conscious and she still hadn‚Äôt been seen by a doctor. Nurses still maintained that she was fine and they had no concerns despite family continuing to ask for help and to see a doctor. 

My mother went into a self induced coma around 9pm that evening and passed away. A doctor finally arrived after she had a seizure and an emergency call was made, but it was too late. A CT scan showed that she had bleeding in her brain which had caused irreversible damage. 

I feel so responsible for what happened. My mother was so strong and always stood up for the underdog and for what was right. She was a thoughtful and caring mother who did so much for me, she was my best friend, but the one time she needed me to stand up for her I failed. We put her into bed that afternoon and put her on the monitoring system, which was flagging issues, but that didn‚Äôt matter either. The staff just shut off alarms and said she was fine. I feel like I allowed them to gaslight me. I didn‚Äôt push hard enough, I didn‚Äôt fight and cause a fuss for fear of being thrown out and now my mother is gone. I don‚Äôt know how to go on living with what happened. ",3,1728955062.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

I wanted to make a coffee flavoured sponge cake.
So i took all the supplies out and organized the things i need in order to bake. 

Eggs, flour, sugar, soda, melted butter. I was so hooked on the butter that i started off whipping the melted butter (room temp) , sugar, beating the shiz out of them both. And wanting to bring it to a peak fluffy consistency.  Somethings wrong. It isnt working, but it certainly tastes yummy.  A perfect mix for a pastry, but I‚Äôm making a cake. 

ThEN, i add eggs. Mix mix mix. As i am whipping and seeing the butter kind of granulate and also foam up mixed with the egg, I‚Äôm wondering, why is it still yellow! It‚Äôs supposed to be white and whip into a meringue consistency. Then it clicks. I fucked up. Instead of starting with eggs and i started with butter. 

I then tried to fix it, more soda,  it still feels a bit dense and flat. It doesnt fix it. Add flour,  a tiny bit more of soda, still not as fluffy as cake batter is supposed to be! Added a dash of cold milk. And it didnt help anything either. 

Now the butter batter has become a little grainy because of cold milk, and the flour a bit foamy but nowhere near the ideal cake consistency. 

I finally called it quits and threw the mix into the oven. I have no clue what tf it‚Äôs going to turn out to be. A flat cake? Brownie? Biscuit? I have no clue. Atleast the flavours all there. 

This wasn‚Äôt my first time baking a cake!! I‚Äôve made a few delicious ones but tifu. üòì

TL;DR
Wanted to create a fluffy sponge, coffee cake with chocolate chip.  I was so focused on the outcome that i messed up the steps. And didnt recognize till later. ",4,1728955028.0,tifu,8,0.56,False

So, why did I come here? 

Honestly, I just wanted to do normal things in a different city. Drink good coffee, take long walks, and take photos.

Reykjavik has been great. Its a small but mighty city. Lots of interesting culture- Punk Rock Museum of Iceland, several art galleries, street art, great tradional food, etc. All in a very walkable  city, if you can walk. 

As a Torontoian, I really appreciate the local's no-bullshit approach to customer service and life. Plus, the local culture hasn't been over run by uncivilized folks. Most people obey traffic laws, politely queue, and I haven't heard of anyone shitting on the beaches (serious issue back home). I haven't smelled weed or seen fast food in a week. Its so nice. 

So, Iceland is advertised for Crunchy adventure type folks. I just wanted you to know that you can visit Reykjavik and have a great experience without having to go into nature. 

Other notes-
-food: same price as Toronto. Enough vegan and gluten-free options
-getting around: No Uber, taxis are 2-3x the price of Toronto Uber, bus takes physical cash or a pass. Don't bother. Just walk. ",0,1728954967.0,VisitingIceland,3,0.45,False

I work at a newly opened restaurant, part of a much larger chain worth millions. There are many problems with the management so far, some are small some are more detrimental.

An example of a small one is that they have loads of teas and coffees on the menu, but didn‚Äôt get a kettle, so all teas take 4 mins of someone standing by the microwave. And there has been 0 coffee training - so when the one person who knows how to make coffee isn‚Äôt there, what do they expect us to do?

An example of a larger problem is that they are refusing to hire more staff, and are in dire need of an assistant manager, so they promoted a waitress after 3 weeks of working there, who has no prior managing experience. 

Last night, a homeless man came in looking very aggressive and confrontational. I was alone on the floor (I‚Äôm 22, 5‚Äô2‚Äù). I say hello as normal and he comes at me with pace and shouts DONT F-ING SAY HELLO TO ME, And is now standing a metre in front of me, red faced, spit coming out of his mouth, shouting ARE YOU GONNA F-ING HELP ME THEN. I manage to slide to the right and around the corner into the kitchen hopefully into safety and he leaves. I follow him and lock the door. (I kept the door locked, from 9:15, out of fear of being attacked. Usually we close at 11pm). 
Afterwards he crosses the road almost gets hit by a motorbike, and then starts banging on the restaurant opposite trying to open the door, luckily there were 3 men on the other side of the door who didn‚Äôt let him get in. And he then went off to the other road where there was a police van and he started aggressively punching his fists all over the van whilst the police investigated a petty theft from a shop nearby (I heard from one of our neighbour shops).  

I sent this account (much shorter, highlighting the main points) to our messaging group (16 members) and not one person responded. 
In the morning my manager sent a message ‚Äòmorning team! Updates for today.. good job and keep it up‚Äô. So I privately messaged the manager saying ‚Äòhey did you see my message yesterday‚Äô. No response. this was 10 hours ago. 

Im unsure what to do. I do feel unsafe. There‚Äôs 3000 pages of risk assessment for sanitiser and candles, but apparently nothing for if an employee gets attacked on site?

She says I should get myself checked out because those are precursor signs of diabetes. For some back story, I'm not the pinnacle of health, rather far from it, been overweight pretty much my whole life. I started losing a sizeable amount of weight early this year which I attributed to cutting out getting coffee out after getting an espresso machine for Christmas. I neglected to mention to my wife that since about March, I've had those symptoms.

Cut to Friday morning, I get checked out and was diagnosed with type 2. I feel like an absolute failure to my kids and feel like I'm letting them down.

1g3vxns,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g3vxns/mf_lost_in_the_madness/,[MF] Lost in the Madness,"

What began as a harmless dabble unravelled into a destructive habit, leaving Tony stripped of his soul, dignity, and everything else in between. The drug itself wasn‚Äôt the issue. It was his mismanagement, and the ridicule from the self-righteous dickheads foreshadowed today‚Äôs aloof society. All too human in a fabricated prim and proper world.

He likes to read Nietzsche by candlelight in his rundown one-bedroom flat to boost his self-esteem. A milk crate sits in the corner and the sound of molten wax sputtering bounces off the wall. The symbolic endeavour threatens nobody, but for a fleeting few minutes, he is the smartest and only person in the room.

‚ÄòWhat were they fucking thinking?‚Äô Tony mumbles to himself, and grimaces at the eyesore. ‚ÄòThey just happen to pick the silo.‚Äô

A massive mural of a foreign leader looms over Tony‚Äôs flat. A symbol of misplaced priorities and the idiots truly believe the image of New Zealand‚Äôs Prime Minister ought to have heritage protection. The notion has some traction and the imposition casts a shadow over the block of flats.

The desire for overzealous individuals to please themselves outweighs the disdain of the majority. A handful of people espouse their superiority, and empathetic admirers endorse them. Too smart for their own good, mediocrity reigns. Welcome to Brunswick, the land between two creeks.

Before hitting the skids, Tony was a taxi driver and played bass guitar in a punk band. The simple, carefree existence of the 1980s isn‚Äôt returning anytime soon, nor are The Smelly Bollocks reforming. He misses the unpretentious smoke-filled clubs. No protests, no posturing, just raw adrenaline and the visceral feeling of being alive.

Back then, the chaos made sense. Everything had a purpose, even if it was to rage against the establishment. There was something to fight for, something real, and the music was salvation. Now, silence fills the void and sometimes, he feels it‚Äôs not just the music he‚Äôs lost, but a part of himself that used to believe in something.

Free from the dreaded scourge, Tony chases the sun and dodges pedestrians along Sydney Road. He sees cafes where pawnshops, pool halls, and fish'n'chips shops once stood. The curse of rising rents and good luck to anybody craving a deep-fried chiko roll. Everything has changed, and Tony endures progress with weary acceptance.

Living the ‚Äògood life‚Äô now means sipping a fair trade coffee with an extended pinky. The enlightened twats ignore the mockery, and the absurdity is laughable. Amid the crowded cafes, the exuberance shows no signs of abating and the clientele truly believe everybody ought to think like them.

Born and bred in Brunswick, Tony has witnessed his suburb‚Äôs reformation. His parents migrated from Italy after the war for a better life and set the foundation. Both worked factory jobs and raised six kids in a two-bedroom cottage. The house no longer stands, replaced with a three-story townhouse that's triple the size.

The new occupants, two young professionals with no kids, have an income tenfold the size of Tony‚Äôs parents earnings. It‚Äôs a familiar story and on cue, a self-righteous fool, dressed like a pauper, kicks over a rubbish bin. She launches into an impassioned rant about saving the orange-bellied parrot, as if this were the most pressing issue of the day.

The over-the-top aggressive manner garners the desired result, and unsure how to react, Tony avoids eye contact. He doesn‚Äôt want a lecture coming his way and crosses the road. Others plan to discuss the issue tonight while smoking dope and listening to Nick Cave on their five grand stereos.

She pumps her fists, and chants slogans with a group of like-minded revolutionists. The words echo, but they‚Äôre hollow and Tony feels a strange detachment. Somehow, the troubled bird‚Äôs predicament rests on his shoulders, and by default he‚Äôs guilty. An apology for sins he didn‚Äôt commit is a far stretch.

Tired of being blamed for every historical injustice, Tony veers off Sydney Road. He keeps his head down, and avoids the potential of another unnecessary confrontation. His thoughts race, trying to shake off the lingering frustration as the noise of the bustling street fades.

‚ÄòSave the orange-bellied fucking parrot,‚Äô Tony scoffs. ‚ÄòHow about a petition to stop useless protests?‚Äô 

Awkward underfoot the bluestone laneways dissect the streets and somewhat disoriented, Tony stumbles his way home. The mural of the foreign leader looms in the distance, a silent witness to his struggles and a left turn onto Albion Street changes everything. He just happens to cross paths with Butch.

Butch the pitbull has a reputation. He‚Äôs aggressive, unpredictable, and on the other side of a flimsy weather beaten wooden fence. Tony slows his pace, hoping to slip by unnoticed and has no confidence in the rotten palings from separating the two.

On all fours, Butch pivots his head and a mauling is on the cards. Muscles tense, and ready to pounce, the most likely outcome appears inevitable. Another wound in a world that‚Äôs already chewed him up, has Tony‚Äôs heart pounding and the decision to take the back streets backfires.

‚ÄòBe a good dog,‚Äô Tony whispers and considers running for his life. ‚ÄòYou better not jump the fucking fence.‚Äô

Their eyes lock on one another and without an ounce of fat, and a head only a mother can love, Butch takes pity. He chooses to laze about in the midday sun and refuses to sink his teeth into Tony. Insulted but at the same time relieved, he watches the dog meander back to his soft patch of grass.

The image of the dog‚Äôs backside, with his tail up and testicles waddling sums up the occasion. A grand ending to a typical day and the incident reinforces Tony‚Äôs dislike of animals. Whether it‚Äôs the orange-bellied parrot, Butch, the protesters or New Zealand‚Äôs Prime Minister they're all fucking animals.

‚ÄòThe bane of society, irresponsible pet ownership?‚Äô Tony mutters and feels a cool breeze run along the back of his neck.

With one foot in the grave, and deep into the final third, Tony collapses onto his couch. A single thought echoes in his mind: maybe it's time to stop fighting the madness and just learn to live with it. Yet, the rage lingers and to lighten the darkened room he lights a candle.

‚ÄòHuman, all too fucking human,‚Äô he shrugs his shoulders, kicks a milk crate over and reads the first page of Thus spoke Zarathustra.

For a brief moment, a wave of grief washes over him. Not for his parents, not even for the old Brunswick, but for himself. For the man who had dreams and felt alive and could laugh without bitterness. He pauses for a second, staring at the mural of the foreign leader casting a long shadow over his flat, and wonders how long he can sustain the nonsense.

I just need to know am I the only person that does this. When I find something I like or a hobby I enjoy, I have to buy everything for it in order to feel complete/happy. Currently, my obsession is making coffee at home. I recently bought a Nespresso machine to combat how much money I was spending daily on coffee ($9 Bucks a day).

Over the last month, I‚Äôve purchased:
- the Nespresso Machine itself
- 100+ pods of coffee
- Multiple creamers
- 5 sauces + syrups
- More accessories like cups, spoons, pump for syrup bottles, etc.
- Several different types of milk

Like everyday I wake up and think of something new I need for my coffee. I can only drink one cup a day but I still feel the need to have every creamer and syrup there is. I‚Äôll see someone post a recipe for their drink and immediately feel the need to buy everything they‚Äôve made theirs with. 

It‚Äôs crazy and I want to stop this lol. Then after a while of obsessing, I‚Äôll get annoyed with it.

Anybody else feel this way about certain things they enjoy in life.",13,1728954409.0,shoppingaddiction,12,1.0,False

1g3vwab,https://i.redd.it/nbi37xxyktud1.jpeg,Upon completion of my rail pass journey: my definitive ranking of Amtrak cafe car items,"Having taken 10 trains coach across nearly 10,000 miles through 34 states over the last month, and having only eaten in the dining car once when a temporary sugar momma with very unclear political opinions I met on the Coast Starlight insisted on buying me lunch (separate story for another time), I have subsisted heavily on cafe car items of varying categories. I present here my rankings, based on an averaging of value, taste and portion size. I did not try everything on the menu, but I tried many things. I also am not ranking national brand items like Haribo gummies, chips etc. just stuff you really only ever see in the Amtrak cafe car. Feel free to fight disagreements out amongst yourselves

HONORABLE TOP-RANKED MENTION
Lemon iced loaf cake slice thing - $3.50ish. Sadly these seemingly are only available on the northeast regional trains I‚Äôve taken from NYC to Boston and DC. They need to be available nationwide. These are the best.


BREAKFAST
#1 - Omelet bites - only $4.50 and an absolute BANGER. Very similar to the Starbucks sous vide egg bites. You essentially get 2 eggs with bacon and cheese for less than $5, which many a respectable sit down breakfast place would charge $7-10 for. These were my morning go-to.

#2 - blueberry muffin - $3.50. Right at the top of reasonable in terms of price, very satisfying crumbly top, bottom part is a tad dry but pairs well with the extremely watery cafe car coffee. A round-the-clock go to.

#3 - streusel coffee cake - $3.50. Similar pricing qualm as the muffin, but also similar high marks in taste and texture. A bit cinnamon heavy, so it ranks below the muffin for me. Also kind of cloyingly sweet so you can only have one or two of these over a span of time without feeling like garbage.

#4 - sausage egg and cheese bialy - $6.00. Maybe I‚Äôd like this more if it was like $5, or if the bialy actually had the texture of a bialy and not a rubberized English muffin with strangely flavorless cheese that melts in a puddle in the bag and lubricates the ‚Äúbialy‚Äù so that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get a good grip on the sandwich. Not much to like here especially when the banger omelet bite duo absolutely blow it away. Trash. I tried it twice and will never get it again.

#5 - bagel and cream cheese - $3. Decent value, Philly cream cheese is always great, but god in heaven this bagel is horrendous both hot or cold. Cold it‚Äôs like eating a block of uncooked tofu, heated up it‚Äôs like eating a slice of bread that has been soaked in warm water for 15 minutes. Would it kill Amtrak to put a real toaster on the train?

LUNCH & DINNER - lumping all the subcategories together into one mega-gory here

HONORABLE MENTION
Fresh Greek salad - when I took the California Zephyr they had these on sale for $3 each. I had 7 of them in 2 days. For $3, they‚Äôre fucking great. For $7.50, idk. My opinion is too heavily colored by the discount I got and it being the only fresh vegetables I had for multiple days, so I can‚Äôt fairly rank this at its normal price point.

#1 - White cheddar Mac and cheese - $7.25. Probably the best overall thing Amtrak sells in the cafe car besides the lemon cake. Creamy, good portion size, when it‚Äôs blazing hot and with one of the little salsa packets they only sometimes have, it‚Äôs like a hug from grandma. My non-breakfast go-to, a legend of the rails.

#2 - Ham & Swiss on pretzel roll - $7.50. This needs to be heated up to really shine but when it comes together all melty and gooey and mustardy, it feels like something you might get at an actual brick and mortar establishment. A bit pricey for the size, but in the middle of nowhere, it can be heavenly.

#3 - Deluxe Stromboli - $7.25 - it‚Äôs a big hot pocket. You can‚Äôt really go wrong but it is kinda too doughy and chewy on the bottom. I‚Äôve also never received the allegedly included marinara sauce so that impacts my judgement. It‚Äôs not bad, but it‚Äôs a distant 3rd behind the mac and the hamswiss

#4 - Turkey and cheddar - $7.50. Overpriced and the bread kinda sucks, but the turkey and cheese are pretty good and the lettuce is usually fresh, though the same lettuce in question prevents this one from being warmed up, which I think could greatly improve the bread situation. Thus, hard to put this any higher than the 3 that are above it.

#5 - Hebrew National hot dog - $5. It‚Äôs a $5 hot dog, it‚Äôs pretty girthy, some things just can‚Äôt go wrong, but the bun is not ideal for microwaving and it suffers because of this. Similar issues as the bagel.

#6 - Angus cheeseburger - $7.25. All the bread problems of the hot dog, zero of the meat highlights, and an additional $2.25 to boot. Terrible.

SNACKS
I only had one thing from this besides my beloved regional lemon cake, and it‚Äôs the chewy marshmallow bar - $3.25. A banger. Chewy, light, lovely hint of browned butter, feels like the best Rice Krispies treat your best friend‚Äôs mom could ever make them to bring into class to share with everyone on the last day before fall break.",23,1728954354.0,Amtrak,11,0.93,False

The other day I felt like going hiking and didn't really have anyone to go with so I thought the answer is pretty obvious, I need more friends.

For myself I like a bit of everything, I'm very much into gaming, gamedev and most recently TCG collecting but I also love sports and outdoorsy activities so I'm up for most things actually. I used to be more nightlife oriented but I slowed down over the years but I don't mind still going out from time to time. Also I've been learning to skateboard recently so bonus points if someone wants to go to the skatepark together.
I think I'm pretty outgoing and don't really have a problem getting along with people but also don't go to out of my way to do so, hence why I'm doing this post.

So if anyone wants to join for hiking, going to a museum, an arcade or just getting together at a coffee shop to hang out, or really whatever else you can think of as there's not many things I don't like just let me know.

Should I accept or just cut it?,"I (24F) met this guy (25M) the beginning of this year through some friends. He ""fell in love"" with me after we talked for a bit that first time we met and told my best friend that he wants to marry me. I think he just had a good amount of drinks going, because we all did drink a bit too much that night, but anyway after a few things that have happened between us this year, he just asked me out on a date yesterday, but with the intention to start something serious. I don't know how to feel about it. 

(A little background on both of us)

* I just got out of a relationship last November and he did too
* My last relationship was 3 years and his was 8 years !!!!
* It was my first and it was also his first, relationship.
* We're both from the same country and our hometowns are literally a city away from each other, both here in the US and our birthplace.
* We both went to the same Uni. 
* We had 5 occasions in which we either passed right next to each other or saw each other, but didn't really figure it was us (if that makes sense) or should have met, but for some reason missed it by a change of mind. 

(Back to the help I need understanding) 

We met in January and after a week of us talking and getting to know each other more. We went out on a ""date"", but our other friends were there too, and we connected even more. I've never been a romantic, but this guys energy and ambition gets me going and I've never felt like this before. Thing is the following month we were out at a bar and we were talking about relationships. I mentioned how I didn't see myself in a relationship anytime soon because I don't believe in getting into relationships out of boredom. I told him how I actually take them serious and that, that's why I don't see myself in one soon especially since I still felt like I was fresh off a relationship. He told me that he thought the same, but then thats where the I felt the energy shifted. 

We stopped talking every single day, and when the weekends would come around (we're in the same friend group now) I would see him when the group decided we'd go out, but when I would see him on the weekends he would yap my ear off and act like we talked every day, flirt and everything.

I had started having feelings for him, but I stopped them, because I thought I wasn't going to be his idiot side piece he can talk to whenever he wants. 

  
I went on a date in April and I posted the flowers this guy gave me because they were a beautiful set. He (25M guy) saw it and went off on me. Telling me that I was rude because I had told him I didn't want anything, but that I was dating, so that I wasn't being fair. 

I told him that HE was the one that basically cut me off and that I wasn't going to go after him and he ignored me. Started telling our friends that basically I left him heart broken and made me look like the asshole (was I? I don't think so but idk anymore) 

Well anyway, we stopped talking for a few months until this last month.

We basically rekindled our friendship...? or whatever it was we had, but this time it feels different. 

  
The first time we saw each other again I felt like crying because I missed him so much, and again, I am not an emotional, lovely, romantic girl. I've always been easy in cutting people off, like my ex, a guy I had more years with then this one I just met this year! 

And this past month he's been so different. He's been so caring and sweet. He buys me coffee every morning without fail and calls/texts me everyday and we've been seeing each other every weekend without fail, but just to do simple things together, like workout, watch a movie, eat lunch or dinner. 

  
and yesterday, he hugged me and told me that he really really likes me and would like to take me out on a nice date whenever I have a free day. 

I haven't answered him and he just texted me to ask me again. I really want to, because I also really like him, but im just scared this might be a trap or idk. Now seeing that I actually care for this guy im scaredddd

so should I take the offer on his date? or should I just really cut it off and move on? ",1,1728953974.0,dating,2,1.0,False

I want a divorce. I just cannot seem to get those 4 words out of my mouth. 

Let me start off by saying I love my husband, but I am no longer in love with him. He is an amazing Father and provider, but he is no longer a romantic partner to me. Hasn‚Äôt been in years.

There is no infidelity. No fights/arguments (we rarely fight). Nothing catastrophic that has happened. We have just been platonic or ‚Äúroom mates‚Äù for quite some time. There is zero passion. We still have sex, but again, no passion. Feels very routine or we are just trying to ‚Äúget off‚Äù. We are comfortable.

Divorce has always been a back thought of mine, and I never wanted to leave because we have two children. But last week the smallest incident happened that just made something ‚Äúsnap‚Äù in my brain. The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back you could say.

Last week, my husband and my son were out running errands. I called him asking if he could pick up my coffee order since they were driving right by it. He was irritated, I had to beg for him to do it. Begrudgingly, he did. Got home, and my son carried my drink and set it on a ledge. My husband bumped it and it spilled everywhere. He lost his shit. He has always had a bad temper but for some reason, I looked at him in that moment and just thought‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúWhat am I doing here?‚Äù 

Ever since that day, I cannot stop thinking about finally pulling the trigger. I have consulted with several friends of mine, balled my eyes out, did a lot of self reflecting, and I cannot shake the feeling. I feel completely suffocated. 

I just know saying this to him will DESTROY him. He will be blindsided. I know he loves me, and I do truly love him as a person. But I cannot live this lie anymore. He will leave for work trips, and I feel like I can breathe when he‚Äôs gone. I take my kids out to do fun things on the weekends, and when he doesn‚Äôt want to join us (which is most of the time) I am relieved. We haven‚Äôt been on a date just the two of us in over a year. He hasn‚Äôt bought me flowers or a surprise anything in YEARS. I went out with some friends over the weekend, and I had to ask for him to tell me that I looked pretty. It is all so forced. I think he is okay with how things are. I mean, after all we are still having sex. But romantically it is completely DEAD. 

Now back to where I started, I want a divorce. I don‚Äôt know how to even begin this conversation. My biggest fear is his temper. I am afraid of him. When he gets angry, he almost ‚Äúblacks out‚Äù. Breaks things, punches holes in walls, screams, ect. He has never hit me and I don‚Äôt think he would, but who‚Äôs to say this conversation wouldn‚Äôt send him over the edge?

When we were young and dating, he put his gun to his head during an argument. One time when we were married he called the police because he was scared he ‚Äúmight do something stupid‚Äù. And to this day (it was actually recent), he will make jokes saying ‚ÄúIf you cheat/leave me. I will in fact kill you. I could easily hide your body.‚Äù Joking or not, with his temper and history I would be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt scare me a little bit. 

I‚Äôm sorry this was so long of a read. My biggest hurdle is getting the words out. I feel like once that is done, the hardest part is over. So I think I am looking for advice from those who have maybe been in a similar situation. 

I love him. I do not want to hurt him. I want to be as amicable as possible (I don‚Äôt want to go to court, fight for custody, child support, ect.) But I also don‚Äôt want to live like this for the rest of my life. We BOTH deserve to one day have a partner who loves and treats us the way we want to be loved.

After returning to Pudong Airport from the trip, it took a while to get back to life from the sleepiness of the 8 1/2 hour flight and the heat of the game earlier in the day. Due to the high level of immersion in basketball and local culture that we experienced every day in the UAE, we didn't have the time or energy to summarize what we saw and heard throughout the entire trip, so I apologize to those of you who have been asking about what's going on in the UAE through various channels.

If there is one word to describe the eleven days of traveling with 20 nuggets fans , it must be unparalleled.

From the moment I met Taylorcracy, who was traveling with me from Hefei early in the morning on the 3rd, a subtle feeling accompanied me throughout the entire trip. Even though almost everyone except me didn't know each other, we could be spotted at once at the boarding gate in Kunming to Dubai - that's the gold-digging element on our bodies. Because I had to accompany my daughter-in-law to the mall, I was the last of the Kunming transfer group to arrive at the boarding gate; by the time I arrived, two rows of seats had been filled with young people in snowy mountain and rainbow costumes, a scene that resembled some school club organizing an autumn excursion. What's more, there was no shortage of passing mine honeys who weren't on this trip snapping photos and posting them to the fanbase to ask questions, and I didn't expect to be right on the money.

I landed around 7pm local time, physically and mentally exhausted from the long flight, and the cool colors of the Dubai airport and the crowded ferry buses were a shot in the arm for what should have been an exciting time for us. For me personally, this gray lens feel rubbed off the filter after meeting up with my old friend and professional tour leader for this trip, STOCK. As another small group that arrived a day before us, from Chengdu, they had already had a full day of fun in Dubai. After the head count, it was clear that most of the group was still in a restrained state, except for the crowd that had already dealt with previous transfers, as most had curbed their curiosity during the 2-hour drive from Dubai to Abu Dhabi after this, to the point that the opening remarks and introductions from the local guide didn't get enough response. After checking in at the Hilton, I bought some instant noodles and achieved the feat of arriving in a new city and going to sleep without doing any shopping, who cares who or where.

The next day's tour started at the Louvre, and the 40 degree heat of Abu Dhabi made the colors of the first group photo we took under the scorching sun particularly bright. After the ‚ÄúNuggets Champions‚Äù chant that accompanied the video, we finally got rid of the tiredness from last night and started taking pictures in groups. This happiness continues to the NBA DISTRICT interactive exhibition, a bus we met the street ball legend ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù Professor, to our team duck head (I myself easy to remember the members of the group in accordance with his WeChat avatar in my own heart nicknamed) excited to fly, hard to control the professor in the front of the bus and we interacted for up to a minute. The professor interacted with us in front of the car for a minute, but only afterward did he realize that he himself had been holding up the pocket and did not press the record button, I think this incident is enough for him to regret for three days.

Subsequent to the event, we met Fisher, Henry, Kasey, the experience gradually full; I also because of the store at the door of the event of a shooting game hit, I got the opportunity to get 50% off coffee, to the snow bunny and his wife, each whole cup.

From the moment we got off the bus, we passed a banner with Nuggets players on it, and everyone took out their cell phones and started recording. Layers of security checks, walk into the stands we immediately rushed to the front row to start playing cards, but found the presence of the field only a few green players are still training, waiting for a long time did not see the Nuggets out, we had to return to their seats to wait patiently.

With the consumption of time, I thought I had calmed down the heart along with the sound of my favorite opening music ‚ÄúRight above it‚Äù rekindled. Out of my love for competitive basketball, the Celtics' players coming out was enough to get my blood pumping, and when the Nuggets, who were considered the home team, appeared on the big screen, my heart couldn't hold it down any longer. The moment Rocky's flag came out of the court, my eyes were already filled with tears without me even realizing it; I knew all the next parts of the game, which direction Rocky would run in next, the Humpty Dumpty sprint that Jokic would surely make, and when Murray and Gordon would touch fists and interact, and all of these scenes were just like a running light that flashed across my mind over and over again at the speed of light in an incredibly short period of time. All of these scenes were like running lights that flashed through my head at the speed of light thousands of times in a very short period of time.

Fifteen years, I waited for fifteen years, this year 27 years old, I have spent more than half of my life to love to follow everything, with my most familiar sound and picture strongly impacted every organ in my body from head to toe, even the air is spread only belong to the Highlander basketball scent. I held up my cell phone to record all this, in order not to let my daughter-in-law find my tears, had to ask him to help me hold up the pocket to record the video to distract from this moment; after all, in her eyes, I am a piece of wood without seven feelings never cried. But the truth is, even just reliving writing these words makes my eyes wet again.

Because of basketball, I know a lot of smelly friends, in our circle there is no lack of many friends who have been to the scene, seen a lot of exquisite copywriting and circle of friends photos to get a lot of likes and envious comments, but the only thing that was patrolling the mountain that year to write down the words impressed. He went to Oklahoma to watch the game and left a long speech at the height of the Murray incident in 2019, and here I'll just excerpt two paragraphs to describe my similar mood that appeared at a similar time and scene: ‚ÄúWhen I went downstairs and walked out of the hotel to the ballpark, I suddenly burst into tears, and that kind of feeling is indescribable, which may be the feeling of a dream that is going to be realized in front of you, and it can finally be seen and touched. can be seen and touched, the distance between me and my dream is only a five-minute walk ......‚Äù , ‚ÄúThe moment I entered the dugout, I don't know why I suddenly calmed down, it was like I was also a local fan who had come to see the game countless times with my season tickets, it felt like the people and the field and the logo in front of me were so familiar, I had seen it countless times.‚Äù

Over the course of the ensuing game, both of my units recorded Murray's lone three-pointer of the game, saw the energy Willis brought to this team in his Nuggets career debut, and then got fed half-court shit from Pickett. As the game progressed, we and the Celtics fans shouted cheers at each other, and even if it's nothing compared to the decibel counts emanating from arenas stateside, it's the biggest and most responsive I've ever heard in my life for a Nuggets chant, and I love it here. Each and every one of us couldn't get enough of it after the game, because we knew that we could have this atmosphere for a long time to come, and that tomorrow morning, tomorrow night, and the day after that belonged to us, and to the Denver Nuggets.

The day after the game we traveled to the Presidential Palace and I have to say it was really nice to see. Unfortunately when we tried to take a picture we realized that the banner from the day before had been confiscated when we entered the arena, so you can see that the local area is really scared of political propaganda. After the end of the trip, we still arrived at the NBA DISTRICT in the afternoon, some members of the team chose to go to the mall because they had had their fun, while I had a clear purpose, which was to squat to the former Nuggets Hall of Famer Camby. Good luck to the explosion, into the door straight to the stadium area, then, fixed eyes on the fans found in the autographs Kambi, did not take much effort to squeeze into the front row to get a signature to complete today's task.

Subsequently wandering around, met a very bright and stylish old man, I know things are not simple, online search is actually a former Michael Jackson's designer, the name is Jeff Hamilton, can be photographed are some of the first-class international stars, that is, no matter who first shot a fan photo of the same style of Wang Hedi and then in the Celtics I just received short-sleeved (activity site with preseason tickets to receive, it sounds like only the Green Army). It sounds like it is only made the green army's pressure root no you mine...) The Celtics short sleeve (sounds like it's only the Green Army that does not have your mine...). The finale of the day's activities is Xiao Luo and Figo, glanced at no interaction opportunities after decisively left the scene, ready to meet with partners and go to the evening of the fan appreciation day activities.

As a result of a long time in advance through the Sizhe and the team reached a cooperation, we will be in the fans day on behalf of the Chinese fans and the team to interact with the gift, all the excitement is very excited, even to the moment of entering the stadium, we have not been official accurate time and operation of the exercise. At the entrance of the stadium, we held a fan printed in Chinese stylized with the identity of the country quickly attracted the attention of the official media, continuous cooperation with them to complete the interview and video recording, we also entered the stadium through the security check.

Since the tickets for the fan day were bought together, all of us sat together, expecting the official to give us specific news, as for the shooting challenge on the court Pickett or Strawser, we all just regarded it as a pastime in the experience. After watching exotic show after exotic show, we didn't get to wait for our moment after all, accompanied by an apologetic message popping up on WhatsApp from the staff. ‚ÄúSORRY! IT WAS KIND OF CHAOTIC DOWNTOWM THERE!‚Äù, as if a pot of cold water had been poured over our heads, and as the players exited one by one, the fans lost their minds and headed out of the arena.

https://preview.redd.it/efxt9jwogtud1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5edc1b9b71dfebe3b1da26b8dab5843dd80b9a5

I walked against the flow of people towards the edge of the railing where I interacted with the Celtics mascot, LUCKY, which meant Rocky was doing the same thing in the other corner of the arena. I stood on the sidelines and uncharacteristically yelled ‚ÄúRocky!‚Äù at the Nuggets mascot across the court, even if it looked funny to a group of Green fans. In fact, I'm not sure if I was trying to vent my frustration at the official failure to fulfill his promise or if I was really just hoping to interact with Rocky, but I was really hoping he would come over and bring some good luck to an imperfect night. Miraculously, after countless shouts, Rocky did come over! Like he could hear the aggravation in our hearts, he traveled across the entire dugout and came straight to us! Yes, Rocky left his clear handwriting on my customized Nuggets jersey that I just had made yesterday (which, according to Jay and Siegel, is a rare thing even for local Denver fans), and his sellout performance brought a little relief to our lost feelings. But regardless, the disappointment and sadness of not being able to deliver the gifts from China to the players still left most of us feeling a sense of disappointment and sadness that was pervasive throughout the bus ride to the mosque. We took a lot of pictures of the magnificent mosque from the same spot where the players had stood during the day, but due to the general mood, such an important site didn't give us a better experience than the McDonald's downstairs. It was an early night for us all.

On the third day of the nba event, I went downstairs in a daze ready to head out to kick off today's trip, only to see everyone at the door saluting each other to a fat black guy. stock saw me coming downstairs and explained to me first, saying that this old man was from Denver and that he had introduced us to a lot of stories about the players he had worked with; he then told the old black guy about me - -While I was still feeling sad about yesterday's events, this fat black man's exclamation interrupted my despondency, and at the same time he began to rummage quickly in his backpack, and eventually pulled out a Nuggets culture shirt that he had made himself and gave it to me, and as a return gift I gave him the fan shirt that I had originally brought to the team yesterday. In return, I gave him the fan I had planned to bring to the team yesterday.

He said his name was DC White and that he'd lived in Denver for 15 years, and then frantically showed us pictures of him with various ballplayers, including Klay, James, Trae Young, in addition to everyone from the Nuggets... He must be a huge fan! After giving us each another Nuggets badge, White said goodbye to us and we started our day at Ferrari Land on Yas Island.

https://preview.redd.it/4hv6usxrgtud1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c95163d2819890f57f579ed5531cb96ffa1b61

By the time the afternoon rolled around, since we didn't get to see the players practice for the first game, we exited Ferrari Land early to gather for the trip to the arena, with the plan to rush in and watch the practice the first time the doors opened for ticketing. Meanwhile, Sizhe, who was in Denver, woke up early and sent me a message saying that he had talked to his colleague in Abu Dhabi to arrange a gift for us for the game, so everything seemed to be on the up and up again. Fortunately, we were able to rush in as soon as the doors opened; unfortunately, I was stopped at the security gate, and after three minutes of pleading with the African man in charge of security, I had to leave my gift outside the stadium; even more unfortunate, after entering the stadium, the WhatsApp I was using to communicate with the team staff would only spin around and not read the messages.

I stood in the front row of the Nuggets' tunnel with a couple of close friends and shouted vigorously to every player coming out of the arena, receiving responses from most of them! The most courteous of them all was Chancellor, who flashed us his trademark smile with every cheer, even though, according to Taylorcracy, a member of the group who flew in from Hefei with me, Chancellor had already trained ten iron shots in a row in front of him.

After looking left and right to see no more players walking back and forth, I spotted a familiar figure, assistant coach Ryan Bowen. His broken pinky finger made him instantly recognizable even to me, a level ten face blindness sufferer. I yelled Bowen's name, and he seemed surprised, immediately looking and walking toward me; meeting someone else on the way to talk to him interrupted his route toward me, but as I yelled his name again, he told me with a look that he'd be right over when he was done. Coach Bowen didn't lie to me, and came to me immediately after the conversation. I told him happily that I knew him, and had been following him since the summer league two years ago, and he was as happy as a child, asking for my name again and again, with a look of relief that was as warm as if he had met an old friend in his hometown.

https://preview.redd.it/rxx1wcswgtud1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d93f0ff951fbe2deee19e3e7c6c3fa2a82d047d4

After saying goodbye to Coach Bowen, I still couldn't get in touch with the team, and Sizhe told me that the Nuggets' staff was looking for me, but they were out of net as well. When I was regretting that I didn't ask Coach Bowen to help me to establish a line, a blue dress host appeared in front of me, after I was sure that she was the host of the Nuggets event, I felt that she looked like Katy Winge, a famous Nuggets blogger on the X, so I shouted ‚ÄúKaty! I shouted ‚ÄúKaty!‚Äù without thinking, and my friends started shouting at her, and to my surprise she spotted us and came over to me. After a few warm pleasantries, I expressed my wish to give the team a gift from China, and she agreed. At this point, I hurriedly collected the fans that my friends had brought in, and found that only four of them were with us, while the others were still on the snow bunnies' bodies. Disappointed, I told Katy that we had brought gifts for each of the players, but that some of our mates were away at the moment, so these were the only ones left. She wasn't the least bit embarrassed and immediately took the fans towards the rest of the staff to communicate and show them off after giving us another photo and autograph. When she returned again, she handed me a picture of Aaron Gordon with a gold signature attached. I was ecstatic and overwhelmed with gratitude for her! She then pulled out a signed photo of Jamal Murray and gave it to the rest of the team, Blackie. How in the world could such a wonderful event happen? I hurriedly asked my partners to send a message to the group to inform the others to come to the players' tunnel to meet up. Ten minutes later, Snow Bunny appeared in front of me with a big sigh of relief carrying all the remaining fans, we hollered for Katy again and told her we did it, these are the other fans, please make sure you pass them on to the players for us, she was as reliable as ever, took the gift and headed to the work area to make the communication.

The game was just about to start, and I was making my way up the stairs again to get ready to find my seat when I ran into DC White, the Denver fan who had been bragging to us for so long that morning. While none of us could quite believe how many people he knew, he greeted every passing Nuggets staff member, and called out to Denver Post reporter Sean Keeler, as well as MVP Westbrook. Westbrook took off the sneakers he was wearing and handed them directly to the young man on our team who was wearing a Willis jersey. The moment he was handed his sneakers, his expression changed from happy, to surprised, to godless in countless subtle ways, countless celebratory shouts erupted around him, and every one of us was genuinely happy for him. Finally, after another 3 minutes or so of accepting this reality, he opened his cell phone and dialed the home video call and cried out, ‚ÄúThis is from Westbrook! Westbrook to me!‚Äù I'm sure that the period of time when his eyes were glazed over was just as mixed as the time when I first stepped into this arena.

Returning to my seat after this joyous interaction, I suddenly felt that I had gradually completed my transformation over the past period of time, and that I had become less like me. Why was this? In my life, I have been a professional basketball reporter, an in-depth sports media, a small leader of an Internet company, a snow god in the hearts of fans, the moderator of the Chinese Nuggets Zone, the founder of the Snowy Mountain site, and a heavy-loaded basketball practitioner, and I have never lacked the opportunity to meet the stars, and have independently accomplished the interviews with a lot of big-name stars, so I can talk to the team and the players in a very eloquent way, but how long has it been since I have been a crazy fan, just like I was just now? But how long has it been since I was just a crazy fan like I was just now? It seems that the scene of speaking English in foreign countries has made me dilute the layers of shackles, and I prefer to believe that it is the partners around me who really love highland basketball that have accomplished the redemption for me.

After the game started, we were still immersed in the joys and rewards of the night. With Gordon, Willis and Porter missing, the Nuggets were quickly outscored, outplayed and outplayed by the Celtics during the time Murray and Jokic were resting. After the game gradually lost suspense I once again opened my cell phone and found a message from Sizhe: ‚ÄúCan you see it? The staff are asking if you're in the players tunnel stands‚Äù, I replied in the affirmative and said that we had done it and had given Katy all the presents, and he was the next to be puzzled. ‚ÄúWhat Katy, this is Kerry Anne! Katy was there, but you've got the wrong girl! But it doesn't matter, just give it to her, I've spoken to her before, everyone knows your story, she'll be able to help you!‚Äù. .

So in fact, we all know, so all along, we are not alone, even in the ballroom without network; just like every one of our Nuggets fans, even if we have experienced more wind and rain, put away the umbrella, we will definitely find each other's existence, we will one day witness the arrival of the rainbow together. And bathing in our rainbow in Etihad Arena, that's now.

Thank you for taking 20 minutes to read through this nutrient-less running diary of the rest of the story, the story of how we celebrated with each other together on the bus ride back, the laughter that filled the entire trip, all the way to Warnerland the next day, all the way back to Dubai, all the way back to our own mundane worlds, all the way far, far away, all the way back to the Denver Nuggets and the love of this sport that we will always have.

# Backstory

36M that ran in high school XC and track, then off and on over the years. Nothing structured with a few 5K and 10K races thrown in. I signed up for the 2023 Long Beach Half Marathon on a whim. I proceeded to do zero training until 6 weeks before, where I ran every few days, and a longest run of 6.55 miles. My thought was if I felt like I could do that twice, I would go for it.

Ended up running it in 2:04:45 and had a BLAST doing it. I decided to sign up for the next years half marathon to see how much I could improve in a year. I started doing structured training for a HM in February then did another plan for a HM in May, with 5Ks and 10Ks sprinkled in as fitness tests.

October: 2:04:45 HM  
January: 22:22 5K  
February: 1:14:27 HM  
April: 42:23 10K and 19:49 5K  
May: 1:33:48 HM

I was hitting times I hadn't come close to since high school. I was learning a lot during each race that I took with me to the next event. My race times reflected progress and I was super motivated to train for the 2024 Long Beach Half Marathon over the summer. Given the progress I was making I set a goal for sub 1:30.

# Training

I started a 20 week training program through Runna that started in May. I had previously used Runna for my February and May HMs. I was at 26 MPW peak mileage for the February HM and 36 MPW for the May HM. For this block I decided to run 6 days a week (from 5 previously) and slowly increase mileage to hit 55 MPW. I did this because I had the time to do it and I wanted to see how my body reacted to this sort of mileage in case I wanted to train for a spring marathon.

To my surprise Runna predicted a 1:26:30 time based off my last half marathon. That seemed insane to me at the time (sub 1:30 was daunting enough) but I decided to trust the process and go for it. The plan was HARD. I found myself dreading the (2) speed workouts every week because it was taking everything out of me. The plan was also increasing in mileage and it was rough on my body. The good news is my body reacted very well to 6 days a week of running and I was feeling more resilient in general, but the speed workouts were kicking my butt. The plan was also too long. That was my fault because I set it to 20 weeks when Runna suggested 12 for a HM. Around halfway through I was getting burnt out. I wasn't sure I was progressing and I felt like the plan was a bit too hot. I dialed it back slightly, changing my target to 1:27:30.

This worked WONDERS. I ended up having a great 5K and 10K during full mileage weeks and felt like I was making progress.

August: 19:10 5K  
September: 39:30 10K

Towards the end of the training I was feeling great during the longer tempo work. Garmin updated their race predictor algorithm and was now predicting a 1:25:40 half! I took it with a grain of salt as previously it would predict a slower time for a race AFTER I had just run a faster time, but it still gave me a bit of confidence. I wondered if I could overperform the 1:27:30 goal with a 1:26:XX time. I set that as my new A goal with my C goal as my original sub 1:30 goal I set for myself in May.

I started to have doubts when I got a head cold right as my taper started. I felt like garbage throughout the taper and wondered if I would be able to hit 1:30 let alone 1:27:30. I kept telling myself this was a combination of the head cold and taper tantrums. I had to trust that on race day I would feel ready for the occasion.

# Pre-race

The week before the race the weather prediction was a heat wave with record temperatures on Sunday. Even though it was completely out of my control I found myself getting upset that after 20 weeks of hard training I could be derailed by excessive heat in October! The race organizers shifted the start to 30 minutes earlier to 6:30am. As the week went on the forecast shifted to be cooler and cloudy, with the day of weather being 60 degrees and cloudy!

Unfortunately I slept horribly that night, and did not sleep great throughout the week. I guess the nerves got to me because I could not seem to fall asleep no matter how tired I was. I slept for minutes at a time before finally getting up at 3:30am. I felt like garbage but after getting some food and coffee I felt surprisingly good!

Getting there ended up being a total cluster as downtown Long Beach was shut down without clear direction to the parking lot I prepaid for at the race expo. Fortunately my girlfriend woke up at zero dark thirty to drive me there. I ended up having to get out of the car and do my warmup to the race start with just enough time to use the restroom and get in my corral. Lesson learned to get there much earlier next time. The stress of getting to the start line in time is not how you want to spend the time before the race. Luckily my girlfriend and her parents found me right before the race start so give me my gels I left in the car and wish me luck. Once the dust settled and I was in place I felt ready to go!

# Race

The gun goes off at 6:30am right as the sun is coming up behind the overcast skies. The weather was slightly warmer than I would have liked, but given that earlier in the week we thought it would be in the 80s and sunny during the race I was not complaining. The start was fairly chaotic, with a lot of runners towards the front that were either starting off at a slow pace or decided to sprint out of the start before immediately walking without moving to the side.

The plan was to start with the 1:30 pacers for at least the first mile to not overdue it and pay for it later in the race. I thought I started near them but after the crowd spread out from the start they were a good ways ahead of me. I look down at my watch and see I am going out at a 6:20 pace after a quarter of a mile, so I pull back to 6:40 pace with the 1:30 pacers not getting any closer. I found a guy who seemed to be inching closer to them as well and used him as my target to pick off.

We are a few miles in when we caught up to (more like crashed into) the last wave of the marathon. This became a challenge as they fairly spread out and there was more weaving to get around them. I tried to stay to the left as much as possible but many of the walkers were 3-4 wide. I had to squeeze between a lot of them, which I felt bad about but there was no other way to get around them on the shared course.

Between miles 4 and 5 I finally catch up to the 1:30 pacers. Either I started much farther back than I thought from them or they went out really hot. There is a large group with them that I debated tucking in with for awhile, but I was feeling good at 6:40 and decided to go by them during the uphill segment on a bridge, including the guy I was targeting to pick off. This ended up working as motivation for the next few miles when I was feeling tired because I did not want to risk them catching up to the guy who went by them on an uphill and burnt out later.

I decided to take my one and only gel of the race right at mile 5. I use Maurten for races since they are the easiest on my stomach. I slowly take it over a half mile or so. If I take the gel in one swoop I tend to cramp. I pass my parents and girlfriend cheering a little past mile 6. This gave me a nice little boost (have to look good going by right?) and I took off to the second half of the race. Long Beach has a good 2-3 miles on the beach strand, which is nice and flat. This whole time I am still navigating marathon traffic, but by this point most of the marathoners are at least jogging and are keeping to the right. There are a few half marathoners that I am trying to pick off, but this dried up by the time we turned around to head back the 3 miles to the finish.

At this point the marathoners turn right and the half marathoners continue down the street to the finish. After the past what felt like forever navigating slower marathon traffic it now felt like I had the whole road to myself. There were a few people ahead of me but I could only see 2-3 half marathoners. Long Beach is overall flat, with only a few hills. Unfortunately this is where the hills were. They were not anything extreme, but with only a few miles left they felt much steeper than reality. I was able to slowly pick someone else off, who cheered me on as I passed him. I was so out of it focused on moving forward at pace that I could just muster up a thumbs up. Random stranger who decided to cheer on the person passing you on a hill, I appreciate you. Similar to pace group it gave me motivation to keep pace so he didn't pass me because I burnt out on the hill.

Around mile 12 someone comes up behind me and blows right by me. He also cheers me on, but it felt a lot worse when the guy smoking you (while seeming like he's barely trying) gives you cheers. For a split second I think about trying to stay with him, but he was moving way too fast. Around here is where the marathon course integrates back and is shared until the finish, but no runners popped out. Up ahead is a turn that I know leads to a downhill to the finish. I start picking it up as much as I can before hitting the turn then emptying the tank down to the finish.

I pass one last guy in the chute and look up to see the timer say 1:27:21 as I cross the finish line.

# Post-race

My immediate feeling after crossing the finish line was relief. I had crossed the 1:30 barrier and then some. I was thrilled with my time, which was a 37 minutes improvement over last year! Like the other races I learned a lot from this one that I'll be able to take with me in the future. In hindsight I think I could have pushed a little harder to get that 1:26:XX time, but I ran a smart race that was much faster than anything I've ever done.

Now that this year long goal is finally done I have my sights set on the marathon. I got into the Tokyo Marathon lottery, so that will be my first marathon on March 2nd. I have a month off from structured training before heading into my 16 week marathon block. I am not sure what to expect for the marathon, but with the base I've built over the past year I am excited to see what's possible!
