Elon Musk wants to control all three branches of both state and federal government. He‚Äôs already mimicking the presidential puppet master Peter Isherwell from the movie Don‚Äôt Look Up. Last year [he vowed to primary Democrats](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/elon-musk-democratic-primary-challengers-00195617) who disagree with him by funding ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Democrats. Now he‚Äôs after [a state supreme court seat in Wisconsin](https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-musk-trump-spending-4d95c11f76be495cc5acadaf9981a42b). With billions of dollars at his disposal and Citizens United allowing him to spend freely, is there anything that can stop him? The General Caucus can.¬†

Let‚Äôs breakdown a scenario where the General Caucus prevents Elon Musk from picking his preferred ‚Äúmoderate Democrat.‚Äù To start, the General Caucus has no impact on parties choosing nominees. It is only a structure equivalent to the general election. What parties do on their own is considered a private matter.¬†

So let‚Äôs say Musk finds his preferred puppet candidate to run against New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It could be any representative, but typing AOC is easier. Musk funds the puppet campaign directly through bundlers and funds a Super PAC to dominate media ads. For argument‚Äôs sake, the Musk puppet defeats AOC in the primary. Is this the end for AOC? In current elections, AOC‚Äôs only option now is rebuild an election campaign with new money to run as an independent in the Fall. But not with the General Caucus.¬†

In a General Caucus system, AOC only needs to show up to her precinct and makes her case to her neighbors on the issues facing the district and why she should be the delegate to represent those issues. Meanwhile, the Musk puppet is also required to caucus at his precinct, where his neighbors may or may not choose him to be their delegate. Money no longer applies as there are no advertisements at the precinct caucus. Real life deliberation between neighbors becomes the political currency.¬†

In modern elections, the norm is two candidates with millions of dollars in their campaign war chests and supported by their own Super PACs, who ultimately start bickering like a bitterly-estranged couple.¬†

But in a caucus, if the Musk puppet shows up to a caucus after spending a million dollars on his campaign and another million in Super PAC ads, it will look excessively corrupt. Especially when Dave the local hardware store owner makes his case to be a delegate at the very same caucus.¬†

There‚Äôs an old story of a rich man that drives an old beat up car. His friend asks him why he doesn‚Äôt buy a nice brand new luxury or sports car. The man replies, if I spend $100K on a new car and I pull up next to someone driving a $250K car, I look like an asshole. But if I pull with my old beater, the $250 driver looks like an asshole.\*

Dave didn‚Äôt spend a dime campaigning but knows his neighbors and the issues they face more than any pollster or analyst ever could. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôd go with Dave, the no-strings-attached small business owner to be my delegate.¬†

This sentiment would be good practice for caucus-goers to reject anyone that actively spends large sums of money campaigning around a town, city, or district. Really anything beyond the use of a home printer to detail pressing issues and having coffee or dinner with neighbors should be met with skepticism.¬†

Back to the hypothetical campaign. AOC also has the option of not campaigning altogether. She could instead choose to not raise and spend any money and just show up to the precinct caucus without baggage. AOC could be like Dave.¬†

AOC could lose. But that‚Äôs ok because the General Caucus is not about AOC, it‚Äôs about the neighborhood‚Äôs interests. It‚Äôs not about political careers, it‚Äôs about communities.¬†

This is the kind of thinking that will prevent Musk‚Äôs puppets he bought in order to own congress. Not only can the precinct caucuses prevent tools of the wealthy, but the state house-district and state-wide caucuses can reject the potential puppets. Three different caucus votes spread throughout a state or district to reject bad apples. And all of it embodied by people who never took a cent from corporate interests. They don‚Äôt need pollsters and analysts and other staff on the best optics to get votes. They simply show up and deliberate with other regular people.¬†

1j2jasr,https://www.reddit.com/r/seducingwomen/comments/1j2jasr/stop_being_a_secondary_character_in_your_own_life/,"Stop being a secondary character in your own life, and become the hero of your life's story!","Hi, David here!

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1j2is3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/estatesales/comments/1j2is3x/what_are_your_estate_sale_pet_peeves/,What are your estate sale pet peeves?,"Mine.

1. When people stand in doorways and hallways not moving. Not because they can't move due to the amount of people, but because they think it's okay to stand in a doorway to look at the things inside the room. This ain't a museum. 

1b. When someone is in the way like this, and you say excuse me 3 times, getting louder each time, and they pretend they can't hear you. I've had to literally football barrel through people before. 

2. When people can't seem to decide who goes up or down stairs, and 2 people try going down and 2 try going up at the same time, and a jam occurs. 

3. When people bring a super-bright flashlight and use it in a already well-lit house.

4. When people park where it says no parking, you let them know it says no parking, and they don't care (but it's fun when cops drive by and start writing tickets).

5. When people get into shouting matches over being number one. 

6. When people want to look at something the same time you're looking at it, acting like they want to buy it the nano-second you put it down. I like to fuck with the ones who do it in almost an intimidating fashion ""oh, I can't wait to sell this for $500"".

7. When a company isn't consistent with pricing. Bought a piece of Lane furniture, few months later saw a matching coffee table, someone beat me to the first one for $50, this sale they wanted $300.

8. When a company assumes cordless tool batteries ALWAYS go with a cordless tool - even if there's no tool with the same brand, and won't sell you the battery and charger, even if it was in a different part of the house. This happens to me a LOT. Last sale, they had the charger and battery in a flat on the tables and still refused to sell it. 

9. When a company puts items in flats for $1/ea, but then won't sell you something nice you found in the flat. Have had 3 companies do this to me. Last time I found 3 Cutco knives in a flat of $1 utensils and was told ""oh, those weren't supposed to be in there"" and tried charging me $75 for 3 knives.

10. When a company says numbers at 8, but starts giving them out at 7:10.

11. When a company won't take an offer on the first day for something broken or damaged. I buy a lot of electronics and sometimes the batteries are leaking into the battery compartment, but they still want full price despite this. 

12. When a company has 3 people checking out customers but don't have a ""10 items or less"" type of line, and you wait 45 minutes to pay because of all the bored rich boomers buying 10 giant duffel bags of literal dollar store junk. 

13. When someone advertises an estate sale but it's not. Like everything of value has been cleaned out, and the house is spacious and all that's there is furniture and tacky decor. No electronics, no kitchenware, no antiques save for bulky bits of furniture, no jewelry, no tools, etc.

I've noticed many of us are creating amazing music with Suno but struggling with how to actually monetize our creations. After experimenting with different approaches, I wanted to share a solution that's working well.**The Monetization Challenge**Many Suno creators face the same issues:

* No direct way to accept payments within Suno
* Difficulty showcasing your music collection in one place
* No clear path for fans to support your work

**A Simple Solution: Custom Landing Page**I've found that creating a dedicated Arco page ([arco.so](http://arco.so)) works perfectly for Suno creators because:

1. **Direct Music Playback**: Fans can listen to your Suno tracks directly on your page without leaving
2. **Integrated Payment Options**: You can connect Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, Patreon, or other payment platforms
3. **Professional Presentation**: The AI-generated dynamic avatar gives your music page a professional feel

**Setting Up Your Monetization Page**Here's how I set mine up:

* Added my best Suno tracks at the top
* Included different support tiers ($5 for a custom song request, $10 for commercial rights, etc.)
* Added a section explaining how supporters can collaborate with me

**Results I've Seen**Since setting this up, I've had several fans support my work through tips, and even received inquiries about custom compositions and potential collaborations. The key is making it super easy for people who enjoy your music to support you financially.Has anyone else found effective ways to monetize their Suno creations? I would love to hear what's working for others!

1j2iivn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1j2iivn/ip_the_patchwork_god_chapter_3_the_oneeyed_wampus/,[IP] The Patchwork God ‚Äî Chapter 3: The One-Eyed Wampus,"The One-Eyed Wampus stepped towards Woodrow, not breaking contact from what was once his own eye. Woodrow felt around for his gun before remembering that he put his holster down on the kitchen counter on his way to the bedroom. He was defenseless. One slash to the chest from the Cat‚Äôs claws, one bite in the neck from its teeth, and Woodrow would be dead.

But it didn‚Äôt bare its claws or its teeth. It just continued to stare at Woodrow‚Äôs bulging eye. There wasn‚Äôt any sort of indication that he was mad at all. He stopped walking, sat and curled his tail around his feet. It occurred to Woodrow that cat was waiting for him to answer a question ‚Äî though what the question was, he had no earthly idea.

So they just stared at each other for a moment, Woodrow tense as steel cable, the cat with no expression whatsoever.

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm the one that stole your eye,‚Äù Woodrow took a shot in the dark about what the cat might be asking him. ‚ÄúSorry. Nothin‚Äô personal. I just need it.‚Äù

The cat continued to stare.

‚ÄúI know, I know, you need ‚Äòem too. That‚Äôs why I suggested we take one eye from two cats instead of two from one,‚Äù he said. The cat did not respond.

Somehow, it occurred to Woodrow that the cat wanted to lead him somewhere in the woods.

As soon as this thought came to him, the cat stood up and made his way towards the door. He got halfway down the hall and turned around as if to say ‚Äúhurry up you old coot‚Äù.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm comin‚Äô, I‚Äôm comin‚Äô.‚Äù

Woodrow rolled out of bed, grabbed his gun, and put his shoes and jacket on. Now, if someone were to ever ask him if he‚Äôd follow a Wampus cat into the woods in the dead of night after it broke into his house, he‚Äôd reply with an emphatic ‚ÄúHell naw!‚Äù, but for some reason, he felt that it was the right call, and that he wasn‚Äôt in any danger. He opened the front door. The cat left first and he followed, locking the door behind him.

It led him around the house and to the trees in his backyard. They went deep into the woods. The cat seemed to see a path that wasn‚Äôt visible to Woodrow, and following close behind him helped him avoid the snags of any rogue roots or stray thorn bushes. They went up, up, up, over moss-covered rocks and through dense brush until they reached a small clearing and Woodrow put his hands on his knees, gasping for breath.

The clearing was relatively flat, with only a slight slope to it, and was covered in untamed grass. Dozens of Wampus Cats were scattered throughout the clearing, mostly curled up on the ground in tight little balls. Some were black, some were slate gray, some were brownish-orange ‚Äî and they all had their big yellow eyes fixed on Woodrow.

He knew he should‚Äôve been filling his pants right about now, but he wasn‚Äôt. His bones told him that they weren‚Äôt going to attack.

The cats all got up at once and moved to one side of the clearing or the other so that there was a clear walkway right down the middle. The One-Eyed Wampus walked down the open path, and Woodrow followed. The rest of the cats turned their heads to keep their eyes locked firmly on him, but stood stock still beyond that. At the end of the path, a single cat stood before him. It was smaller than most of the cats around, maybe only a little bigger than your run-of-the-mill cougar, but its face was noticeably more angular, meaner looking than the rest, with a mask of gray standing out on a backdrop of black fur. Woodrow surmised that this was the One-Eyed Wampus‚Äôs mother.

‚ÄúI know you didn‚Äôt bring me all the way out here to hear me apologize,‚Äù said Woodrow, ‚ÄúOr to kill me. So what is it that y‚Äôall want?‚Äù

The Mother didn‚Äôt say anything.

Woodrow felt something emanating from the old cat that he didn‚Äôt expect ‚Äî respect. It was clear as day; the Mother respected the cunning and bravery it would take to steal the eye off of a Wampus Cat, and appreciated the restraint it took to do it without killing the cat in question.

‚ÄúIf someone can take your eye, then they deserve your eye,‚Äù Woodrow whispered. The Mother cat nodded her head ever so slightly.

‚ÄúBut he disagrees,‚Äù Woodrow looked at the One-Eyed Wampus. His eye narrowed and his pupil dilated. ‚ÄúHe wants to take me in a fair fight. Me and Bill Jones.‚Äù

The Mother cat nodded again. The air seemed to get colder around them. The wind seemed to grow stronger. Woodrow determined that he had three days to bring Bill Jones into the den of the Wampus cats, and then they would each take a turn fighting the One-Eyed Wampus to the death ‚Äî no weapons allowed. He had been spared on this night was so that he could bring Bill Jones to them. The One-Eyed Wampus hated Bill Jones. The only reason Woodrow was still alive was to bring him to the den; they couldn‚Äôt get past the traps set throughout his property, or they would‚Äôve done it themselves. If they refused, then each other member of the Bigfoot Boys would be hunted down, killed, and laid in front of Bill Jones‚Äôs front yard.

‚ÄúWell damn, alright then,‚Äù Woodrow replied to the silent cats. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let him know the deal first thing in the morning. See you again soon.‚Äù



\*\*\*¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way in Hell we‚Äôre going back there.‚Äù Woodrow sat in Bill Jones‚Äôs living room, sipping a cup of coffee and half-watching an episode of Pig vs Pig, a show where morbidly obese men engaged in competitive eating contests against genuine swine. Usually the men won easily, but the swine was giving the man a real run for his money this episode.

‚ÄúRight?‚Äù Woodrow continued. Bill Jones was in the kitchen peeling hard boiled eggs over the trash can, and didn‚Äôt seem to hear Woodrow for a second.

‚ÄúWait, wait, back up for a second,‚Äù Bill Jones said while he rinsed the peeled eggs in the sink. ‚ÄúThe Wampus cats talked to you last night?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, not exactly,‚Äù said Woodrow. As he was about to say what happened, how he seemed to just intuitively understand them, he realized how ridiculous it all sounded.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt say it, I guess. But I just knew.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike they were talking to you telepathically?‚Äù Bill Jones asked, fascinated by the direction the conversation was going.

‚ÄúSorta. Almost felt like I was talking to myself, to be honest. It was like I just knew that‚Äôs what they wanted to say, if they were able to say it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow.‚Äù Bill Jones darted back and forth across the living room, looking in end table drawers and under couch cushions until he found a notebook and a pen. He wrote down a couple of things and tossed the book aside.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Woodrow said. ‚ÄúBut what I‚Äôm trying to say is that they want us to go fight a Wampus Cat barehanded, or they‚Äôre gonna hunt us down ‚Äî Slugfoot and Chuck too. But we can‚Äôt go in there and do that though, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Of course we can. We‚Äôre gonna get you that eye, Woody. I know you wanted to do it without killing them if you could, but clearly they don‚Äôt seem to mind. So why not? It‚Äôs perfect, really ‚Äî you get the eye and we won‚Äôt piss off any more Wampus Cats, by the sound of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, if one of us could actually take a Wampus cat in a fist fight. I don‚Äôt reckon we can though.‚Äù That was an understatement. If they went through with this, they‚Äôd both get torn to shreds, no doubt about it.

‚ÄúAre you sure about that?‚Äù Bill Jones asked. Every time he asked that question, it meant he had some sort of trick up his sleeve. He went off to the garage for a minute and came back with a leather jacket and blue jeans on.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù He grabbed his keys and opened his door. Woodrow raced after him.

‚ÄúWhat? Right now?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Bill Jones replied. ‚ÄúTrust me on this. I got your back, Woody.‚Äù

Woodrow sighed, but he hopped into the truck and they headed to the opening in the woods that the One-Eyed Wampus had shown him the previous night.

‚ÄúYou know I know you‚Äôre a smart sonofabitch,‚Äù Woodrow started while they made their way to the Wampus den. ‚ÄúBut this is dumber than dog shit. I couldn‚Äôt win a fistfight with a damn puma, let alone a Wampus cat. Neither could you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you really knew what a smart sonofabitch I am, you‚Äôd know that I got something to fix that.‚Äù Bill Jones pulled a syringe from his jacket pocket. It was filled with a thick, pitch black liquid.

‚ÄúInject this into my neck when we‚Äôre just about there. Hopefully it‚Äôll do the trick,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúHopefully?‚Äù Woodrow replied. ‚ÄúWhat is this shit?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm damn near certain it‚Äôll do the trick ‚Äî about ninety-nine percent sure. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been working on for a while now, but I haven‚Äôt had a good test for it til tonight. Just make sure I‚Äôm the one that fights him first and give this to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus, alright. Give me that shit.‚Äù Woodrow snatched the syringe from Bill Jones. The fluid inside of it bubbled and flowed in different directions of its own accord. He tried not to think about it too much. When they were almost to the clearing, he popped the cap off of the needle and stuck it into Bill Jones‚Äôs neck, just as he was told to do. Bill Jones shuddered quietly as the dense fluid entered his bloodstream, but nothing seemed to change beyond that.

The One-Eyed Wampus was nowhere to be seen in the clearing. He didn‚Äôt expect them to show up so quickly, Woodrow reckoned ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt expect it either. But when the cats saw the two men enter their den, a few of them got up and dashed into the woods. A moment later, the One-Eyed Wampus was in front of them.

‚ÄúBill Jones wants to go first,‚Äù Woodrow said. ‚ÄúThat alright with you?‚Äù

It was. Woodrow had to step aside, and could in no way help Bill Jones at any point, unless he wanted every Wampus in the den to pounce on him at once. The cats all cleared the area and Woodrow stood among them so that it was only Bill Jones and the One-Eyed Wampus left in the clearing.

The man and the cat circled each other, each waiting for the other to strike first, to make a wrong move. There was a wild look about Bill Jones that Woodrow had never seen before on his usually-stoic friend. Finally, after the suspense had built to a breaking point ‚Äî the One-Eyed Wampus pounced.

Bill Jones sidestepped out of the path of the cat‚Äôs claws and kicked him hard in the ribs. Woodrow had never seen Bill Jones move so quickly before ‚Äî he hadn‚Äôt seen any man move so quickly before. He almost seemed like a wild cat himself. The One-Eye Wampus stumbled back a few steps and roared. Bill Jones roared back. The two of them collided. The cat ripped at Bill Jones‚Äôs chest with his claws and he sent a torrent of fists at the cat‚Äôs shoulders and head. The cat sliced through the leather jacket and sent three streams of blood cascading down Bill Jones‚Äôs belly, but he didn‚Äôt seem to notice. He connected with a nasty right hook to the side of the cat‚Äôs head and the scratching stopped. He stumbled, dazed from the blow. Bill Jones took advantage of the opening and jumped on top of the One-Eyed Wampus, pummeling him, screaming maniacally. Wet cracks emanated from the cat‚Äôs head with each blow until he stopped moving and Bill Jones stood up victorious.

‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù Woodrow said.

‚ÄúCarry that to the truck for me, will ya?‚Äù Bill Jones said and pointed at the cat‚Äôs corpse. He was panting hard and felt the blood when he put his hand to his chest. Woodrow hoisted the body over his shoulder and the two of them left the clearing. The rest of the cats did not protest.

‚ÄúWe need to get you to a damn hospital,‚Äù Woodrow said. He threw the cat into the bed of the truck and sat in the driver‚Äôs seat.

‚ÄúNaw,‚Äù Bill Jones panted. ‚ÄúJust wrap me up when we get to my house. And get that eye on ice.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you touched, boy? You‚Äôre gonna bleed out before we can even get you home!‚Äù Woodrow countered.

‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt that serious. The bleeding‚Äôs already starting to stop.‚Äù The blood was starting to coagulate over the wounds, but there was still plenty more seeping between Bill Jones‚Äôs fingertips. It wasn‚Äôt looking good. Woodrow stomped on the gas and floored it to Bill Jones‚Äôs house.

‚ÄúGet that cat in the freezer, now. I‚Äôll tend to these wounds myself.‚Äù Woodrow had to help Bill Jones out of the truck. He was pale and could barely stand up straight.

‚ÄúI really think we should get you to a hospi‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúHurry! Gotta freeze it as quickly as we can!‚Äù

Bill Jones stumbled to the bathroom and Woodrow hustled to the garage. There was a big, empty chest freezer pushed against the wall that Bill Jones had bought for this exact occasion. He flipped it open and stuffed the whole cat inside.

‚ÄúYou alright in there?‚Äù Woodrow knocked on the bathroom door.

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine. You can come on in if you want. I‚Äôm not takin‚Äô a shit or nothin‚Äô.‚Äù

Woodrow opened the door and Bill Jones was sitting on the toilet with his shirt off and bandages wrapped around his chest. A red splotch slowly grew bigger on the white gauze, but his face looked less pale and his eyes weren‚Äôt as cloudy.

‚ÄúWhat was that shit you took?‚Äù Woodrow asked.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Bill Jones replied sleepily. ‚ÄúCan you get me a bag of chips or something? I‚Äôm starving.‚Äù

Woodrow reluctantly went to the kitchen and grabbed a bag of chips. He threw them at Bill Jones, who scarfed them down on while still sitting on the toilet.

‚ÄúAre you seriously not gonna tell me what that shit was?‚Äù Woodrow pressed.

Bill Jones looked up and looked deeply into Woodrow‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù he repeated. ‚ÄúAll that matters is we got you that eye. We‚Äôre making progress. Can probably get your surgery in next week.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you even be able to fuckin‚Äô walk next week?‚Äù Woodrow said.

‚ÄúYeah, of course, I ‚Äî‚Äú

Bill Jones coughed. Blood flew from his mouth and splattered against the wall in front of him.

‚ÄúHoly shit, I‚Äôm calling an ambulance.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I‚Äôll be fine, I swear on my granny‚Äôs life. Just help me to my bed so I can get some sleep. It‚Äôs been a fuckin‚Äô doozy of a day.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt even noon yet, but Woodrow didn‚Äôt disagree with him. He just carried his friend to bed and wondered what in the world was going on in that head of his.

So anyway. Here's MY story. There'll be a lotta ME but you'll have to cope. 

Me a 17 year old man (I got half a mustache so yeah, deal). I can barely make mom's coffee machine to work. I've tried using a lawnmower once or twice but not my thing, I'm more of a thinker than doer. It exploded last time for a reason, and for the best anyway. I have three apps, tikkie tokka YouTube and reddit. I don't care to learn whatever else I get migraines. 

Anyway so I'm writing a hyper speed time traveling gigaepic fiftology (for those that don't know means 50 book series). It will contain futuristic stuff of course. Mainly where I feel technology will go in current scientific timeline and add to it. Probably will be a pinnacle among Nasa employees maybe but they're poor asf I've heard so they'll have to make do if it's too sophisticated for them. 

I will have my own language in it. Grammar apostrophes in heaps etc. 

I don't really have a question, insightful reflection or need advice at al. If u have questions I can maybe squeeze in one answer or two. We'll see. 

Maybe I'm an inspiration for beginners. I'd be baffled if I saw a post such as this when I started 2.5 weeks ago.

Keeping a smile on my face for kid and Fiancee.,"40 year old here. I didn't have the best start in life. Grew up in a poverish family that often had to decide between lights on or food on the table. I also struggled with knowing what to do with my life until my 30s. I managed to save money to return to college and work in a field I love and make around $61k a year. I did have to take out a student loan of around $7k.

Now onto the meat of this story. I met my Fiancee when I went to college and we hit it off. She's a wonderful beautiful women but she worked in a coffee shop. Which is fine I don't choose my partner's based on their income levels. She now works in another industry making around 42k a year.

When we got our first apartment together this was before COVID. Our rent was $900 a month. Split down the middle $450 each. I managed to save a lot of money during this time. Around $18k to put towards a house. Once I got this amount of money I decided to buy my first car. We could afford it and at the time even with a new car and insurance and gas we were still ahead.

Then COVID happened. My province was spared of it for a long time but however due to this people moves here in droves and jacked up the cost of units. I nervously awaiting for the notice in my mailbox of a rent increase and finally it came.

Old rent $900. New rent $1600.

It was time for us to go. We used my savings to buy a house. Houses were a wild market and we had to settle for a condo. Our mortgage/property tax and condo fees all come together to cost $1500 a month. Still a lot but at least we own and for a few years the amount we pay is fairly stable.

However wages have not been matching inflation. Cost of living. My car that I could easily afford suddenly became a huge financial burden. My Fiancee got pregnant and we had a beautiful child.

Most months I finish with negative $300 in my bank. It's rough. My Fiancee is aware but she chooses to not let it stress her. In order to protect our relationship and our child I have to do the same.

Giving up the car isn't feasible because we all need to get to work and the kid to daycare. Canadian winters are cold and brutal. We get food from Costco so we carry a lot.

There is a light at the end of the tunnel. My car and student loans will be paid off in 3 years. Once it is that opens $800 a month and our financial struggles will end. I am also due for a promotion this year it next that will bump my pay by $12-15k which should allow me to break even on to of the 3% raise I should be getting this week.


There is a lot of uncertainty..it's a scary. USA politics is creating a lot of uncertainty. Federal election popping up this year. Economy can go either way.

I guess I just wanted to vent. I am scared and stressed but there is an ending to this. I guess I need reassurance I'm not the only one struggling...or at least to hear something positive..",3,1741007653.0,povertyfinancecanada,2,0.67,False

But many years later we met again at a grocery store (I was 22 and he 32 back then) and went to drink some coffee at a cafe and my heart didn't stop from racing when I was with him. I had a thing for older men because everytime I dated someone in my age it didn't go well and I wanted some more mature and not  wanting to being some kind of second mom to them because I was the one in the relationship who was the more mature one. 

After a long time of just being friends, we started dating which made Jessica act strange since then, always telling like he is just using me or that I'm to young for him and that he is probably just a creepy older guy who is after young and dumb girls. Which he isn't he always treated me like a queen, being there for me when I was depressed and crying or being mad at stupid little things because of my mental health problems he didn't stop being the best boyfriend ever (I thought back then that Jessica was just overprotective because that's how we were towards each other's always there for each other).

 We moved in together and after a two years it wasn't a surprise when he asked me in our vacation to Paris under the Eiffel Tower on Valentine's Day to marry him. I said yes of course. When I told Jessica that we got engaged she react surprisingly happy and was eager to be a part of it. So we were about to get married on the 14th October 2023, the same year he asked for my hand in marriage on Valentine's Day, so we had to plan everything quick but it was very stress free because everyone in my and his family was helping us with the planning.

I was about to tell Jessica that I wanted her to make my maid of honor so I invited her to go out drinking and after we got a bit more tipsy she suddenly started to talk about how she hated all of my past relationships and even my soon-to-be husband because she always had romantic feelings towards me but couldn't tell me because I wasn't single everytime she wanted to confess to me. So she decided to tell me this information just a few months before my wedding and excepted me what? To ditch my husband? I was so shocked but I told her that i appreciate and feel flattered that she confessed to me but my heart belongs to him and that I had such strong feelings for him for years so I can't accept her confession, then I stood up and left the bar I was looking chilled from the outside but inside I was mad and afraid at the same time. I couldn't believe that my best friend would bring me into such situation.

I loved my husband so much and I felt so happy when he asked me to be his girlfriend and later his wife. And Jessica was my bestie for years. I was so paranoid that she would somehow disturb my wedding, like when the priest asked who is against this wedding bla bla that she would stand up and shouting, to stop this wedding. So I didn't invite her telling her that because of money and because the wedding was so suddenly planned that there would be only my parents, my sister and my grandparents, the same way with his family so we will have just a small wedding with the inner family members, which was actually the truth and *she said* she understands because weddins are not cheap and that we always can have a little meet up to celebrate just with friends, which I liked because not every friend could have had made it on the actual date because they all lived in different states.

Now I'm and my husband are married for a year and are happier then ever after. I didn't told Jessica that the truth yet,  why didn't invited her to the wedding so I always have to bite my tongue when she complains about not being there infront of me to other people when this topic comes up but never tells them the part where she confessed her feelings to me just a few months before my wedding while being drunk. I don't want to hurt her by telling her that it was because of her confession that I didn't invite her plus like I said it was a very small but cozy wedding because I married the love of my life.

I know I should tell her the truth but still I don't understand why she keeps up this petty behavior. It hurts me a lot that she tries to put me up into a bad lighting at this situations, like making me look like I hurt her, never considering that she also hurts me with that. So am I really the a*hole here?",8,1741007320.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,7,0.79,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Pour exercer ce m√©tier, il est possible de suivre une formation professionnelle dont le co√ªt varie entre 500 et 2 500 euros, en fonction de plusieurs crit√®res. La dur√©e de la formation, le niveau de comp√©tences enseign√© (initiation, d√©butant, interm√©diaire ou expert) et la r√©putation du centre de formation influencent directement le prix. Certaines formations offrent une approche plus avanc√©e, permettant d‚Äôacqu√©rir des comp√©tences approfondies en mati√®re de pr√©paration de caf√© et de latte art.

Plusieurs options existent pour financer une formation de barista. Le Compte Personnel de Formation (CPF) peut √™tre utilis√© √† condition que l‚Äôorganisme de formation soit r√©f√©renc√© aupr√®s des autorit√©s comp√©tentes. De plus, les demandeurs d‚Äôemploi peuvent pr√©tendre √† un financement partiel ou total par France Travail, en fonction des besoins du secteur.

Concernant les conditions d‚Äôacc√®s, aucun pr√©requis sp√©cifique n‚Äôest g√©n√©ralement exig√© pour int√©grer une formation de barista. Toutefois, certains centres peuvent requ√©rir un niveau bac, mais cela reste rare. L‚Äô√©l√©ment primordial pour r√©ussir dans cette voie est la passion pour le caf√©, les saveurs et le service client. La cr√©ativit√© et l‚Äôenvie d‚Äôoffrir une exp√©rience gustative de qualit√© sont des qualit√©s recherch√©es dans ce m√©tier.

Le d√©roulement de la formation repose sur un √©quilibre entre cours th√©oriques et exercices pratiques. Les participants commencent par apprendre les bases du caf√©, les techniques d‚Äôextraction, les diff√©rences entre les vari√©t√©s de caf√© comme l‚ÄôArabica et le Robusta, et les diff√©rentes pr√©parations de boissons lact√©es. La partie pratique permet aux futurs baristas de manipuler le mat√©riel professionnel comme le moulin √† caf√© et de s'exercer √† la r√©alisation d‚Äôespresso ou de cappuccino sous la supervision d‚Äôun formateur. La dur√©e des formations varie de 1 √† 15 jours, g√©n√©ralement en pr√©sentiel, et d√©bouche sur une certification attestant des comp√©tences acquises.

1j2i1te,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1j2i1te/create_a_life_of_balance_and_fulfillment_with/,Create a Life of Balance and Fulfillment with Mindful Practices,"In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, it‚Äôs easy to feel out of balance and overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life. Many of us juggle work, relationships, and personal goals, often feeling like we‚Äôre constantly racing against the clock. However, creating a life of balance and fulfillment is possible with the power of mindful practices. Mindfulness involves being fully present in the moment, without judgment, and it can help you reconnect with yourself and find harmony in all aspects of your life. Here are a few mindful practices to help you achieve a more balanced and fulfilling life.

# 1. Prioritize the Present Moment

In the rush to accomplish everything, it‚Äôs common to either dwell on past mistakes or worry about future challenges. One of the fundamental aspects of mindfulness is bringing your attention back to the present moment. When you focus on what‚Äôs happening right now, you release the burden of past regrets and future anxieties.

To practice this, try grounding yourself in the present by simply taking a few deep breaths and becoming aware of your surroundings. This can be done anywhere‚Äîwhether you're walking, eating, or even working. By paying attention to the sights, sounds, and sensations around you, you allow yourself to fully experience life as it is, leading to a sense of peace and fulfillment.

# 2. Practice Gratitude Daily

Gratitude is a powerful tool for cultivating a sense of balance and fulfillment in your life. When you make gratitude a regular part of your routine, it shifts your focus from what‚Äôs lacking to what‚Äôs abundant. Gratitude helps you appreciate the small joys in life, creating a sense of fulfillment and contentment.

Each day, take a moment to reflect on what you're thankful for. It could be something as simple as a warm cup of coffee, a kind word from a friend, or a beautiful sunset. By acknowledging the positive aspects of your life, you foster a mindset of abundance, which leads to greater balance and joy.

# 3. Engage in Mindful Movement

Movement is essential for both physical and mental well-being. Mindful movement, whether through yoga, tai chi, or simply walking, allows you to connect with your body in a deeper way. It encourages you to be fully present with every step, stretch, or posture, which can lead to a more grounded and balanced feeling.

Engaging in mindful movement helps release stress, improves circulation, and increases body awareness. Whether it‚Äôs a slow morning stretch or an afternoon walk, moving with intention can help you clear mental clutter and bring a sense of calm and fulfillment to your day.

# 4. Set Boundaries for Better Balance

In order to maintain balance in life, it‚Äôs crucial to establish boundaries that protect your time, energy, and well-being. Mindfulness can help you recognize when you are stretching yourself too thin or taking on more than you can handle. By tuning into your feelings and noticing when you feel overwhelmed, you can set healthy limits and prioritize self-care.

Setting boundaries may mean saying no to additional responsibilities, taking breaks when you need them, or spending time alone to recharge. Establishing these limits ensures that you have the space and energy to focus on what truly matters, leading to a more fulfilling life.

# 5. Cultivate a Practice of Self-Compassion

Self-compassion is an essential aspect of mindfulness that promotes emotional balance. It involves treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend. Many of us are quick to criticize ourselves when we fall short or make mistakes, but practicing self-compassion helps us accept imperfections and move forward with greater resilience.

When faced with challenges or setbacks, try to speak to yourself gently and encourage yourself as you would a loved one. This practice fosters emotional balance and encourages you to keep going without unnecessary self-judgment.

# Conclusion

Mindful practices offer powerful tools for creating a life of balance and fulfillment. By prioritizing the present moment, practicing gratitude, engaging in mindful movement, setting boundaries, and cultivating self-compassion, you can foster a deeper sense of peace and contentment in your life. These practices not only help you stay grounded and balanced, but they also encourage a more intentional and meaningful approach to everyday living. Start small and incorporate mindfulness into your routine‚Äîsoon, you'll find yourself experiencing greater fulfillment and a deeper connection to the present moment.",1,1741006590.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

Last week I‚Äôm one of the house parties I had a mental breakdown and she was consoling me, and afterwards asked if she wanted to come home with me (smooth brain moment). To which she wisely said no. I then messaged her saying it was a right choice to do that as I was not mentally stable and didn‚Äôt want to mess things up. Afterwards I asked if she wanted to go out for drinks this week, to which she said yes.

I feel really bad about what I did before and my immaturity, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs too late to try to make it work again or if there‚Äôs anything left. Honestly, this uncertainty is eating at me and I don‚Äôt know if I should say something before the drink or during the night out.

I didn't really like her at first but I started to developp feelings pretty early on. We are both traditional Catholics so that's how we clicked together at first.   
  
We  talk many things, some more flirtatious and bantery but other times we got into serious convos. It's  good balance. The way she cares and interacts  about me is different than all other women ''friends'' I've had.  
She will chose excessive concern when something slightly wrong happens to me, she will be super quick to reply almost in a creepy way, she will defend me when others make fun of me. I've complimented her here and there and she reallly appreciates it. She has  begged me at times to compliment her  it's very cute and funny. She will make out of her to tell me she laughed.  
  
 We disagreed over coffee preferences  once and she sent a No with a heart emoji.I fumbeled it pretty bad in my response tbh. I made her laugh one time because she used the word ''DITTO' I thought it was a nickname and she meant she was feeling the same way about  me telling her I really liked talking to her. Just yesterday she freaked out because the app we are texting bugged and from my understanding it showed that I had blocked her (I did not).  
  
. My best guess is that she probably suspects I'm into her. 

I have a worry however, she has used the word ''bro'' a couple times. To be fair, she has clarified to me that she uses it with  al ot of  people  after I made a joke resisting the urge to call everyone bro.  They are also always  in contexts where she  playfully calling me out.Same thing for man. They are also sometimes used as filler words. 

Examples:
One time I was just talking how I didn't wear a mask for  dusty work and she told me: Bro that's demolition 101.  
Other times it was along the lines of get some sleep bro !
Another time is where I confused her and she said: you are confusing me bro

It doesn't seem intentional and with her comment about calling people bro it's sort of a bit reassuring but I' have OCD and it has latched on to that fact

I'd never heard of it before but it looked interesting. It's from the 19th century, so it's very Dickensian. When it came out, it was the highest selling children's book of its time, even outselling Alice in Wonderland. So I was a little surprised at how I'd never heard of it.

The gist of the story is >!that there is a young street urchin called Jessica who starts hanging around a coffee stall. The man running the stall takes pity on her and gives her a free coffee as long as she stays out of the way and doesn't put off his customers.!<

>!One day she decides to follow him after he finishes work and discovers that he also works as the verger in a church. She has never set foot in a church before and is very curious about it.!<

>!She eventually sneaks into a service and is discovered hiding behind a curtain. Of course she is welcomed to join, but the coffee seller is embarrassed that this scruffy street urchin has followed him there and thinks it might be reflected badly on him.!<

>!One day Jessica doesn't come to his stall. He gets worried about her, and is upset that he doesn't know where she lives. He talks to the pastor who basically tells him off for committing the sin of pride, and that even though he showed the girl charity, he is still at fault for worrying about his own image above her wellbeing.!<

>!He eventually manages to find the slum where Jessica lives and discovers that her mother is sick and is at death's door. All is good in the end and Jessica says that Jesus sent the coffee seller to her and saved her mother.!<

>!The coffee seller questions this and says he was just following the pastor's teaching and doing the Christian thing by helping her. It is then highlighted that by following Jesus's teachings, he is effectively acting on his behalf.!<

The story struck me as very interesting because it's the first time I've really been made to think about God as an idea instead of a purely physical presence; that by directly following God's teaching, you are basically manifesting him on earth. When I was a kid, I was always asking things like ""if God is real then why doesn't he do XYZ"" in search of some kind of divine intervention.

I‚Äôm trying to decide on the best coffee machine setup for making milk-based drinks like cappuccinos for four people on a budget of up to $1000. I‚Äôm considering several options and would appreciate your votes and model recommendations based on which one delivers the best taste.

Option 1: Single Boiler Portafilter Machine

This machine uses a single boiler, so you‚Äôd need to pull double shots and steam double portions of milk sequentially (two drinks per cycle).

It‚Äôs known for producing a richer, more nuanced flavor, but it requires more manual effort.

Key question: Will the manual, consecutive cycles affect the taste or texture, and is the extra work justified?


Option 2: Bean-to-Cup Automatic Machine (Brews Two Cups at a Time)

Examples include models from Nivona or Melitta (for example Ci touch) that brew two cups simultaneously, meaning you‚Äôd only need two cycles for four drinks.

It offers greater convenience and consistency, though it might not quite match the flavor profile of a portafilter machine.

Key question: How noticeable is the taste difference between this automatic process and a manual portafilter, particularly in milk-based drinks?


Option 3: Bean-to-Cup Automatic Machine (Brews One Cup at a Time)

In this setup, the machine (Nivona, Melitta) brews one cup per cycle, so you‚Äôd run four individual cycles for four drinks.

I‚Äôm curious whether brewing one cup at a time will have any adverse effect on the overall flavor and quality compared to brewing two cups simultaneously. 


Additional Note:
Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt found any double-boiler machines under $1000. If you know of any new models in this price range, please mention them in the comments.

Final Consideration:
Based on all of these factors, which models or setups do you think provide the best balance of taste and convenience? If you were in my shoes, which option would you choose? Additionally, would the flavor of the drinks differ significantly between a portafilter machine and an automatic one?
Thanks in advance for your suggestions and model recommendations!

1j2hrv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1j2hrv9/how_we_organically_scaled_an_ecommerce_skincare/,How we organically scaled an ecommerce skincare brand from $2000 to $48000/month within 8 months,"Hello Redditors, just wanted to share a recent success story of a skincare brand that we worked with. 
When the owner first approached us for marketing, she was losing money on paid ads despite having high-quality products developed by a talented dermatologist. Business‚Äôs online presence was a mess, and the website wasn‚Äôt communicating brand‚Äôs offerings in a convincing manner. I understand that the humble beginnings of this venture might be relatable for a lot of you and I hope you guys will be able to find immense value through this post. 

After our initial market research we found that there is genuine demand in the market for their products but the trust factor is missing. When we found that the owner herself is a dermatologist, we proposed that we can rally the brand behind her professional authority instead of draining money on paid ads.     

Here‚Äôs how we did it: 

What really changed things for them was our approach of making social media and SEO work together instead of treating them as separate channels. In this strategy, social content feeds SEO performance, and SEO research informs social content creation. Since sometime, we have been noticing that google is paying way more attention to social signals, viral TikToks and Reels are showing up in search results. This means that if you are creating good content on social media, you‚Äôll not only make sales through views on that particular platform(which dies down after a few days) , but your content will get indexed on google as well creating a never ending stream of sales. This works really well for service businesses too - we've seen accountants, lawyers, and consultants use the same principles to grow their client base in addition to ads. We still chose traditional SEO with social media for this brand because there was decent search volume for relevant keywords. 

First things first - we had to fix their website. It was a technical nightmare. Won't bore you guys with the specifics but here are some key technical changes that we made - We had to rebuild the whole thing from design perspective, got the page load speed down from 4.2 seconds to 1.8 seconds, fixed their site architecture (they had product pages competing with category pages), implemented proper canonicals to fix duplicate content issues, and added relevant schema markup for their products and reviews. Small thing, but we also compressed all their product images - they were loading 4MB images on mobile which was killing their Core Web Vitals scores. Don't sleep on technical SEO - it's boring but it is extremely important. Even if you are planning to do seo yourself, make sure to generate a technical seo report from several free tools available online and fix the issues before moving ahead. 

For our keyword research, we didn't just use the usual tools. We dug into Reddit, Quora, and skincare forums to find the actual language people use when talking about skin problems. Direct keywords like, ""anti-aging cream"" get a ton of searches, but the competition is insane. Instead, we found long-tail opportunities around specific ingredients and skin concerns. Like, ""fungal acne safe moisturizer"" has decent search volume but way lower competition, and the conversion intent is super high. This works in literally any industry - find the specific language your customers use and optimize for those phrases instead of the obvious head terms everyone else is fighting over.
We then turned SEO insights into social-first content. So when we saw people searching for ""niacinamide benefits for skin,"" we didn't just write a blog post. We had the founder make a quick and engaging reel explaining the science in a way that didn't feel like a lecture. People were searching for this info anyway - we just gave it to them in a format they'd actually enjoy consuming.

A practical example of our approach: We identified ""bakuchiol vs retinol"" as a high-potential keyword. We created:
A detailed, scientifically-backed blog post comparing the ingredients
A series of short-form comparison reels with product applications
An infographic breaking down the benefits of each that went viral on Pinterest
A downloadable skincare guide for sensitive skin featuring both ingredients that worked a lead magnet

The result - The blog post ranked in the top 3 for the target keyword, while the social signals from the viral content further boosted their search rankings. Meanwhile, their social reach expanded because the content was backed by solid SEO research showing what people actually wanted to know.

For social, we used some of our go-to strategies that always seem to work but still aren‚Äôt widely used especially by new creators. For instance, we had the founder film her videos during ""golden hour"" because we noticed that soft, natural lighting boosted watch times by 22%. We also tested different hooks and found that starting with something like, ‚ÄúHere's something your dermatologist probably isn't telling you about..."" doubled engagement compared to other intros. 

We also experimented with what we call ""content sandwiching"" - we'd post a teaser on TikTok that ends with ""full routine on Instagram,"" then post a slightly longer version on Instagram that says ""full guide on our website."" This created this perfect funnel that moved people across platforms and eventually to their store. The engagement metrics were great, with about 18% of TikTok viewers actually making it all the way to the website. I've seen this work for all kinds of businesses - from real estate agents to coffee shops to software companies. I won't suggest doing this a lot though as it might create frustration among followers. We usually use this strategy when we already have a decent following on all the platforms so that the final traffic which reaches the website is actually worth it. Also, if you have been posting valuable content consistently, your followers are curious to find additional platforms for connecting with you and  don‚Äôt mind following a few extra steps for supporting your business.

Another strategy that worked really well was intentionally leaving out small details in reels that people would ask about in comments, then the founder would reply with separate reels as responses. Instagram's algorithm LOVES this kind of engagement, and it also gave us ideas for future content based on what people were asking.

We also tried something a little different with their content calendar which has wired well for us in the past as well. Instead of sticking to the usual approach of posting at ‚Äúoptimal times,‚Äù we grouped content around specific skin concerns and released it all at once. For example, we‚Äôd create five videos about acne and post them within 2-3 days. This made the algorithm take notice and treat the brand as an authority on that topic. Almost immediately, we‚Äôd see a big jump in followers who were  interested in acne solutions.


This is a sustainable way of growing followers since the content clusters belong to similar categories, the audience attracted by the first topic stays interested as we explore more topics. After a few days, we switch to another topic, like dry skin or anti-aging but we keep adding interesting content related to previous content clusters from time to time. For instance, after the initial acne videos, we‚Äôd follow up with more related content, like ‚Äúbest products for acne-prone skin‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to prevent breakouts.‚Äù This kept the momentum going and maintained interest over time. 

For the first couple months, we focused mostly on creating amazing content and building free backlinks. As the revenue and profits started increasing, we ramped up our link building to include some paid backlinks as well. Basically don't get too caught up in advanced link building when you're starting out (if you don‚Äôt have the budget) - for most niches, the basics still work great if your content is actually good.

Our content strategy had four main pillars: Educational stuff (science behind ingredients, common skin care myths), Before & After transformations, Behind-the-Scenes content (showing how products are made), and some promotional stuff (but super minimal). The educational content consistently crushed it compared to other categories. We've found this content mix works for almost any business - just adapt the pillars to your industry.

The most important question you should ask yourself before posting anything is super simple: ""If this showed up in my feed and it wasn't from my brand, will I actually watch it?"" If the answer isn't an immediate ""hell yes,"" scrap it and look for something else. This one question probably saved us from posting tons of mediocre content that would've just been ignored for previous clients as well.

After continuous efforts for 8 months, their organic traffic has now gone from practically nothing (1,200 visitors) to 37,000 monthly visitors. Their rankings have improved from ranking for just 12 keywords to over 780 in the top 10 positions. Their conversion rates have hit 3.8% from organic traffic (which is pretty good e-commerce), and their social following on Instagram went from 2,300 to 68,000, TikTok from zero to 42,000. 

When the owner first approached us, profitability wasn‚Äôt her immediate concern. With so much competition online, her primary goal was to scale revenues first. She planned to focus on profitability later by introducing upselling and bundle-selling strategies once the brand had gained traction. But because we focused on organic growth methods, the business became profitable right from the start. 

The brand is projected to hit $100K/month by third quarter and we're now working on phase 2 of our strategy - expanding into YouTube with more in-depth content, building an interactive skin type quiz for the website which will act as a lead magnet, targeting more keywords for SEO, launching email campaigns for retargeting and the owner has decided to reinvest a small part of profits into paid ads now so we are working on a ppc strategy as well. 

Marketing strategies should be designed with profitability as a core goal from the beginning. This can give businesses a significant advantage - It ensures sustainability and provides the financial flexibility to experiment and scale faster in the long run.

, and some tips for future travellers.

We were 3 couples travelling.~ 33 yo. 

1. Stayed at villa the wave 1.  4 bedroom villa. Located about 15 min from chaweng by bike. Cost about 800 usd for three nights ( about 75 usd pp per day ). Sick view. 

Great villa, great staff. Had a pool. 

Note : zero privacy with adjoining villa if you‚Äôre in the pool, otherwise its great. 

2. If you‚Äôre planning for a short trip for partying / exploration ,which was our agenda , best to stay at any resort in chaweng itself. Good ones on the street. Otherwise cabs / scooters. Cost us about 500-600 baht for a 15 minute ride. Minimum fare you get is about 300 for anything anyway.

Also be ready for bolts / grab to cancel often unless you‚Äôre at chaweng road or main areas. We used the villa hotline. They make a WhatsApp group with you and you can ask for anything. Cabs. Food. Spa. 

Scooters if you‚Äôre taking and are two people, take minimum 155-160 cc scooties. Roads tend to get ridiculously steep for some places. Cost about 400 baht per day. Plenty available. 

60 min Thai massage average cost about 300-350 baht. 

If you‚Äôre coming from bangkok, exchange money there. Terrible rates at samui. 

3. checked out seen club and ark bar. both okay for a fun time. ark has an awful dj that will poorly mix all the commercial EDM tracks across the last 10 years. But otherwise sitting on the beach and seeing the fire show is fun. drinks were decently priced. 

everything is open till about 2-2.30 am. 

4. Had a magic shroom milkshake from pineapple bar on chaweng. quite powerful ( we had 1/2 a g of penis envy shrooms each ). two of us were more or less first timers, remaining experienced. the guy said 1g per person should be good for a great 3-4 hour trip, we did 1/2g and completely went mental. pretty much had to go back to the villa ( thankfully didnt get our scooters ) and tripped tits for around 5 - 6 hours. these guys also sell chocolates, but sometimes they had it on display, sometimes didnt. but you can totally go and ask, they will have. 

5. had breakfast and nonna and sons - fantastic place. great acai bowls. good coffee. also had a meal at day and night ( former michelin star ) - badass beef smash burger. 

6. went for ziplining - didn't do it though because of the long waiting line- but the place is gorgeous. you can go and just chill out there for a meal and pics. 

7. Lamai has some fun bars. went to the third wave beach club for breakfast and beachside chill. fabulous espresso martinis. also the waves at lamai are far better and bigger. 

8. went to jungle club for a sundowner. great cocktails, and a mindblowing view. might need reservations. we didn't, got lucky, went on a wednesday, but it was almost full. 

Basically, koh samui was fun, but ko tao which we went later was way more fun. 

Thats all i can think of, any other questions, can DM me.

1j2hjri,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketing/comments/1j2hjri/how_we_organically_scaled_an_ecommerce_skincare/,How we organically scaled an ecommerce skincare brand from $2000 to $48000/month within 8 months,"Hello Redditors, just wanted to share a recent success story of a skincare brand that we worked with. 
When the owner first approached us for marketing, she was losing money on paid ads despite having high-quality products developed by a talented dermatologist. Business‚Äôs online presence was a mess, and the website wasn‚Äôt communicating brand‚Äôs offerings in a convincing manner. I understand that the humble beginnings of this venture might be relatable for a lot of you and I hope you guys will be able to find immense value through this post. 

After our initial market research we found that there is genuine demand in the market for their products but the trust factor is missing. When we found that the owner herself is a dermatologist, we proposed that we can rally the brand behind her professional authority instead of draining money on paid ads.     

Here‚Äôs how we did it: 

What really changed things for them was our approach of making social media and SEO work together instead of treating them as separate channels. In this strategy, social content feeds SEO performance, and SEO research informs social content creation. Since sometime, we have been noticing that google is paying way more attention to social signals, viral TikToks and Reels are showing up in search results. This means that if you are creating good content on social media, you‚Äôll not only make sales through views on that particular platform(which dies down after a few days) , but your content will get indexed on google as well creating a never ending stream of sales. This works really well for service businesses too - we've seen accountants, lawyers, and consultants use the same principles to grow their client base in addition to ads. We still chose traditional SEO with social media for this brand because there was decent search volume for relevant keywords. 

First things first - we had to fix their website. It was a technical nightmare. Won't bore you guys with the specifics but here are some key technical changes that we made - We had to rebuild the whole thing from design perspective, got the page load speed down from 4.2 seconds to 1.8 seconds, fixed their site architecture (they had product pages competing with category pages), implemented proper canonicals to fix duplicate content issues, and added relevant schema markup for their products and reviews. Small thing, but we also compressed all their product images - they were loading 4MB images on mobile which was killing their Core Web Vitals scores. Don't sleep on technical SEO - it's boring but it is extremely important. Even if you are planning to do seo yourself, make sure to generate a technical seo report from several free tools available online and fix the issues before moving ahead. 

For our keyword research, we didn't just use the usual tools. We dug into Reddit, Quora, and skincare forums to find the actual language people use when talking about skin problems. Direct keywords like, ""anti-aging cream"" get a ton of searches, but the competition is insane. Instead, we found long-tail opportunities around specific ingredients and skin concerns. Like, ""fungal acne safe moisturizer"" has decent search volume but way lower competition, and the conversion intent is super high. This works in literally any industry - find the specific language your customers use and optimize for those phrases instead of the obvious head terms everyone else is fighting over.
We then turned SEO insights into social-first content. So when we saw people searching for ""niacinamide benefits for skin,"" we didn't just write a blog post. We had the founder make a quick and engaging reel explaining the science in a way that didn't feel like a lecture. People were searching for this info anyway - we just gave it to them in a format they'd actually enjoy consuming.

A practical example of our approach: We identified ""bakuchiol vs retinol"" as a high-potential keyword. We created:
A detailed, scientifically-backed blog post comparing the ingredients
A series of short-form comparison reels with product applications
An infographic breaking down the benefits of each that went viral on Pinterest
A downloadable skincare guide for sensitive skin featuring both ingredients that worked a lead magnet

The result - The blog post ranked in the top 3 for the target keyword, while the social signals from the viral content further boosted their search rankings. Meanwhile, their social reach expanded because the content was backed by solid SEO research showing what people actually wanted to know.

For social, we used some of our go-to strategies that always seem to work but still aren‚Äôt widely used especially by new creators. For instance, we had the founder film her videos during ""golden hour"" because we noticed that soft, natural lighting boosted watch times by 22%. We also tested different hooks and found that starting with something like, ‚ÄúHere's something your dermatologist probably isn't telling you about..."" doubled engagement compared to other intros. 

We also experimented with what we call ""content sandwiching"" - we'd post a teaser on TikTok that ends with ""full routine on Instagram,"" then post a slightly longer version on Instagram that says ""full guide on our website."" This created this perfect funnel that moved people across platforms and eventually to their store. The engagement metrics were great, with about 18% of TikTok viewers actually making it all the way to the website. I've seen this work for all kinds of businesses - from real estate agents to coffee shops to software companies. I won't suggest doing this a lot though as it might create frustration among followers. We usually use this strategy when we already have a decent following on all the platforms so that the final traffic which reaches the website is actually worth it. Also, if you have been posting valuable content consistently, your followers are curious to find additional platforms for connecting with you and  don‚Äôt mind following a few extra steps for supporting your business.

Another strategy that worked really well was intentionally leaving out small details in reels that people would ask about in comments, then the founder would reply with separate reels as responses. Instagram's algorithm LOVES this kind of engagement, and it also gave us ideas for future content based on what people were asking.

We also tried something a little different with their content calendar which has wired well for us in the past as well. Instead of sticking to the usual approach of posting at ‚Äúoptimal times,‚Äù we grouped content around specific skin concerns and released it all at once. For example, we‚Äôd create five videos about acne and post them within 2-3 days. This made the algorithm take notice and treat the brand as an authority on that topic. Almost immediately, we‚Äôd see a big jump in followers who were  interested in acne solutions.


This is a sustainable way of growing followers since the content clusters belong to similar categories, the audience attracted by the first topic stays interested as we explore more topics. After a few days, we switch to another topic, like dry skin or anti-aging but we keep adding interesting content related to previous content clusters from time to time. For instance, after the initial acne videos, we‚Äôd follow up with more related content, like ‚Äúbest products for acne-prone skin‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to prevent breakouts.‚Äù This kept the momentum going and maintained interest over time. 

For the first couple months, we focused mostly on creating amazing content and building free backlinks. As the revenue and profits started increasing, we ramped up our link building to include some paid backlinks as well. Basically don't get too caught up in advanced link building when you're starting out (if you don‚Äôt have the budget) - for most niches, the basics still work great if your content is actually good.

Our content strategy had four main pillars: Educational stuff (science behind ingredients, common skin care myths), Before & After transformations, Behind-the-Scenes content (showing how products are made), and some promotional stuff (but super minimal). The educational content consistently crushed it compared to other categories. We've found this content mix works for almost any business - just adapt the pillars to your industry.

The most important question you should ask yourself before posting anything is super simple: ""If this showed up in my feed and it wasn't from my brand, will I actually watch it?"" If the answer isn't an immediate ""hell yes,"" scrap it and look for something else. This one question probably saved us from posting tons of mediocre content that would've just been ignored for previous clients as well.

After continuous efforts for 8 months, their organic traffic has now gone from practically nothing (1,200 visitors) to 37,000 monthly visitors. Their rankings have improved from ranking for just 12 keywords to over 780 in the top 10 positions. Their conversion rates have hit 3.8% from organic traffic (which is pretty good e-commerce), and their social following on Instagram went from 2,300 to 68,000, TikTok from zero to 42,000. 

When the owner first approached us, profitability wasn‚Äôt her immediate concern. With so much competition online, her primary goal was to scale revenues first. She planned to focus on profitability later by introducing upselling and bundle-selling strategies once the brand had gained traction. But because we focused on organic growth methods, the business became profitable right from the start. 

The brand is projected to hit $100K/month by third quarter and we're now working on phase 2 of our strategy - expanding into YouTube with more in-depth content, building an interactive skin type quiz for the website which will act as a lead magnet, targeting more keywords for SEO, launching email campaigns for retargeting and the owner has decided to reinvest a small part of profits into paid ads now so we are working on a ppc strategy as well. 

Marketing strategies should be designed with profitability as a core goal from the beginning. This can give businesses a significant advantage - It ensures sustainability and provides the financial flexibility to experiment and scale faster in the long run.

My doctor put me on Pantoprazole for 2 weeks beginning of January and symptoms disappeared. Now we are going into March and the symptoms are returning. WHY?! 

Does anyone know the cause of this or how to treat it long term? Is it common for it to return so quickly after 2 weeks of acid reflux medicine? Does this suggest I have an ulcer or something?",1,1741004855.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

So jist of this is, im in the UK, been with my wife for 5 years , married 6 month, young child together and step kids .I'll Start by also adding there's alot of stress in her life just now with various things, big things , and I'm probably not much help as I dont communicate with her properly and I don't worry about anything until it happens . So I had hard time understanding her stress and would just say it will be fine dont worry., So my wife in the last couple of weeks ,who I 1 million percent trusted started being a bit more waring of leaving her phone about. She would always leave it if she went out to shops or anything and this started to get me noticing and having been in a previous long term relationship where I was cheated on I started to feel insecure. One night she was on her instagram and must have went to search or something and this guys name popped up in the search or recents, i didnt quite see,and she quickly closed the app. So that got me on edge even more , our love live has dropped a fair bit and I feel I always make the first move but again she says she ls stressed along with kids and usual home life, I do try help around house but she also likes the independence and won't let me do dinner , help tidy etc as I wouldn't do it properly. So I done something I never do and I looked at the messages in her instagram, nothing else , and there was a message from this guy, who is quite well built, a trainer I think, which is even more of a blow as she's always telling me go to the gym . Now the messages are just general chat chat , but this is the first she has ever spoke to him and what I can see started after her commenting on a photo of his , the conversation was cut off as it seemed she had deleted previous ones , so I just left it at that , I checked again the next day and his name was gone in her inbox, but over a few days and checks , just quick checks ,he would appear back and there would be a message from him , or her to him so I can see she's obv constantly deleting the chats the whole time , this was only over a couple of days but it was really getting to me , and she could tell something was up , so i said i was insecure as we weren't making love and seemed distant , and that was all that was wrong with me, she had a go back saying I don't talk about things and let it build up and create situations , where as is if I spoke to her I would realise she was stressed etc , and that she does love me, so we make up  and another couple days pass, and it's the same script , deleted convo but this time he's asking to meet for coffee, so again my head goes into over drive, so this time I go the opposite I make sure she knows I appreciate her, I love her more than anything on this earth, which I do, and tell her if she was ever being pushed away to tell me etc , she says she loves me , quite affectionately and that will never happen, she still extremely affectionate , and always cuddle and tell each other we love each other , and every other app she has the notifications go on locked screen along with the actual message , which is one of the reasons I always trusted her . But after telling her all that stuff and her reassuring me I think they still send a couple of messages. Sorry that it's so long winded , I'm stuck as what to do as if I tell her I seen her phone I'm worried that then that's the trust all gone, but if I leave it I know how it will go, exp as he is single, and she is attractive and bubbly , but as far as I can see there's nothing bad in the messages apart from maybe some mild flirting , I keep making excuses in my head that she's stressed and maybe looking for an escape etc as I don't want to belive it. Was looking to see if anyone had any logical advice . Thanks ",9,1741004826.0,Advice,14,0.91,False

Our content strategy had four main pillars: Educational stuff (science behind ingredients, common skin care myths), Before & After transformations, Behind-the-Scenes content (showing how products are made), and some promotional stuff (but super minimal). The educational content consistently crushed it compared to other categories. We've found this content mix works for almost any business - just adapt the pillars to your industry.

The most important question you should ask yourself before posting anything is super simple: ""If this showed up in my feed and it wasn't from my brand, will I actually watch it?"" If the answer isn't an immediate ""hell yes,"" scrap it and look for something else. This one question probably saved us from posting tons of mediocre content that would've just been ignored for previous clients as well.

After continuous efforts for 8 months, their organic traffic has now gone from practically nothing (1,200 visitors) to 37,000 monthly visitors. Their rankings have improved from ranking for just 12 keywords to over 780 in the top 10 positions. Their conversion rates have hit 3.8% from organic traffic (which is pretty good e-commerce), and their social following on Instagram went from 2,300 to 68,000, TikTok from zero to 42,000. 

When the owner first approached us, profitability wasn‚Äôt her immediate concern. With so much competition online, her primary goal was to scale revenues first. She planned to focus on profitability later by introducing upselling and bundle-selling strategies once the brand had gained traction. But because we focused on organic growth methods, the business became profitable right from the start. 

The brand is projected to hit $100K/month by third quarter and we're now working on phase 2 of our strategy - expanding into YouTube with more in-depth content, building an interactive skin type quiz for the website which will act as a lead magnet, targeting more keywords for SEO, launching email campaigns for retargeting and the owner has decided to reinvest a small part of profits into paid ads now so we are working on a ppc strategy as well. 

Marketing strategies should be designed with profitability as a core goal from the beginning. This can give businesses a significant advantage - It ensures sustainability and provides the financial flexibility to experiment and scale faster in the long run.

Futile is chasing the butterflies, those can't survive the mirror of reality 

The paralysis that hits in the midst of a crowd, seeing a face of duality

A passing stranger that looks ethereal carries heaven in their face

While the heaven is a stranger, asking everything to be at stake 

But most of all - my world 
My world is like the hit of coffee that makes one alive in the perpetual dream existence 

What kind of journey lunacy yearns that starts with the core's resistance 

The love, the limerence, the lust, the loathe, fuels 
everytime, the illusion, when it fades 

The illusion that sits like a touch-me-not waiting to be tickled, only to be fazed

But the pain, the pleasure, the depression, the fervor rings in the ear

I don't know if it is free will but hitting the snooze in fear 

5 more minutes. I need 5 more minutes. I can't look away, life is erotic

The intoxication, the seduction, the temptation, the hallucinations are hypnotic 

I'm in a trance in a deserted land but can you blame me 

I lose what I have to gain and what resides in uncertainty?

I sink in my bed in a wrapped cocoon 

The bed made of sand, draped in the material womb

This shell of a skin that I want to leave, hurts like hell but I want to be free

But I'm scared to be born I'm scared to be, I'm scared to breathe, I'm scared to be

I rolled in expecting just another hostel, but this place? Cozy, social, and has Wi-Fi that actually lets you work instead of just buffering your regrets.

Highlights:  
¬†Location? Smack in the middle of everything cool.  
¬†Wi-Fi? Fast enough that I didn‚Äôt have to scream at my laptop.  
¬†Vibes? Chill, friendly, and not one of those awkwardly silent hostels where everyone just stares at their screens.  
¬†Staff? Absolute legends. Would trust them with my plants (if I had any).Bonus: If you book through Patoko [https://patoko.link/s](https://patoko.link/s), you get 10% off, which means more money for coffee, byrek, or whatever fuels your remote work hustle.

It was my first week in college, and I was already lost‚Äîliterally. I had no idea where the damn lecture hall was when she appeared out of nowhere, balancing a coffee in one hand and a half-open book in the other.

""Freshman?"" she asked, smirking.

I nodded.

She pointed down the hallway. ""Take a left, second door. Try not to look so confused.""

I was about to thank her, but she was already walking away.

After that, I kept running into her‚Äîat the library, in the canteen, once even in the pouring rain when she handed me her extra umbrella without a word. She never told me her name, and I never asked. It was easier to pretend we had all the time in the world.

Then, one day, she was just‚Ä¶ gone. I asked around, but no one seemed to know her. No one even remembered seeing her.

Maybe she transferred. Maybe she dropped out. Maybe she never existed at all.Maybe I'm the nothing.

All I know is, I never saw her again.

I can't believe that I am here with Lolita! We are in front of the main entrance waiting for Mr. Marathon Man to do the intermediate running before school. Coach gave Julie a visitors ID for the month which lets her come into the building, drop off her stuff, and shower off the sweat after running. Coach also gave her permission to use her office to get some of her work done because the College Library doesn't open up for a couple of more hours.

Lolita was shocked when I pulled out my accordion on the ferry and played away. Of course, she knew I was doing this but watching it seemed so natural and surreal. And I collected about $20 that goes into the instrument fund for the ACS middle schoolers.

Night the Fam had so much fun listening to Lolita's stories about her 2 months on the road. I had forgotten how funny she is when she does her impersonations! She had us rolling on the floor!

Lolita absolutely hates hotel breakfast she has every day and the coffee they make there. She ate our food truck's ""New York bacon/eggs/cheese on a roll"" and black coffee like it was the greatest culinary achievement in life!",1,1741004035.0,LoHeidiLita,0,1.0,False

They 
haven't lived in the same city for over 5 years now, and keep in contact via text. Last year, he told me he was talking to her about going to Vietnam together for three months. This ended up not happening, but what made me worry about this was he had previously mentioned that they both were interested in one another during high school. Granted, that's a long time ago but it made me feel worried that they wanted to go away for so long together. He had previously told me that he wanted to do that trip with me, and any time we have tried to plan a holiday together, he has dragged his feet a bit, although we usually make it happen in the end. He says that he isn't interested in her and it's not like that, but I can't help but feel insecure about it. He wants to meet her this weekend for coffee and asked me if I'm okay with it, and honestly I'm not but I don't want to be insecure and controlling. We also had a bit of a rocky start to the relationship, with him seeing another girl secretly before we were official. We have talked about this a lot and he has been good since, but it's really hard to let go of the insecurity that it left with me as I will always know that he was or is capable of lying to me. He really has been truly honest and open with me since then however. Any advice would be great.",1,1741004023.0,relationshipproblems,1,1.0,False

I (20M) have been talking to, texting, flirting and hanging out with this girl (20F) and when I tell you we have hit it off I mean home run. She‚Äôs funny, beautiful, smart, her vibe and overall personality is just electric. I‚Äôve known of this girl for a few months as she is my (19F) cousins best friend. But we never really talked until about mid January where things sparked and just continued to grow and grow. Before the question is asked, yes my cousin is okay everything going on with me and her friend. 

Here is where things get tricky this girl was in a relationship that lasted about a year up until the end of January. However, I made it very clear to her that I wouldn‚Äôt lay a finger on her while she was in this relationship. No hand holding no kissing no NOTHING. I barley complimented her, out of respect for that relationship. Now Ik I might look like the bad guy here but her and my cousin attest to the fact that the relationship has ended on her end at least 6 months back. She was over it she was just waiting for a fight so she could leave. Again I know this is kind of dangerous waters and may seem crazy. 

After she left him we started texting a little more here and there and that was the snowball that started to roll. We got to know each other more and more everyday that passed, and we learned that we not only want similar things out of life but also like the same things, foods, jokes, music, we are literally 2 peas in a pod. Constantly flirting and making remarks with each other. We went to SixFlags as a group a week into February where everything was like usual we joked flirted but and the end of the night when I went to drop her off before heading home we talked for about half an hour about how we both felt about each other and made it clear to each other we are in the same page but neither of us want to rush into anything . However we did kiss for the first time that night. I smiled the entire way home and felt something different in me. Things kept heating up a little more from there from late night conversations to a couple make out sessions with one in particular ending with her on my lap. I‚Äôll take this time to make it clear we have not slept with each other which I have no issue with, I‚Äôm not the type of person that depends on that. However it was infinitely clear that we both wanted each other, things continued amazing however about a week ago we hung out went out for breakfast and she mentioned wanting to buy my mom (42F) flowers since I was taking her coffee to her job. Everything went well my mom loved her. When asked about her I refer to her as my friend and she refers to me as her friend again in part to us wanting to take things slow. Especially on her end since she‚Äôs fresh out of a relationship, she doesn‚Äôt want to deal with the rebound comments or look bad to her family. She wants this to be something fresh and healthy for both of us which we agree on . However after that day we had breakfast we had a conversation about slowing down the physical aspects, the kissing and everything else that was happening. I‚Äôm incredibly respectful of that so I agreed and took that step back. We still talk everyday and call every day, flirt and we saw each other a few days ago and even have a plan to get lunch this Wednesday. I‚Äôm just worried that she wanted to slow down everything because she‚Äôs losing interest, I asked her and she said no that‚Äôs not it and that she does still want me and wants to be with me.. she came with me about a week ago now to a family dinner as well and met my sister and stepdad and aunt and uncle. And every I agrees, there is a chemistry between us both and you can see we want each other and everyone loves her. But again, i still refer to her as my friend and she refers to me the same. What‚Äôs the best course of action from here especially with her saying she wanted to slow down physically a few weeks ago?
