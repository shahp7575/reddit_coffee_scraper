","Hey, I'm enjoying my Friday evening after a long and chaotic holiday week. I felt like hanging out on discord and chatting about random stuff. Just socializing and meeting new people/friends.

Requirements are just be normal, be able to hold a convo and be around my age. Strictly sfw.

Hobbies are pretty basic like reading, meditation, skincare/self-care, yoga, hiking, coffee brewing etc.

Me and David became close from the second he sat next to me at that party. I distinctly remember those brown eyes and curly brown hair that he never really combed, but the messy look suited him very well. He was tall, Hispanic, and had a perfectly trimmed beared that covered his masculine features. I always did my best to sneak behind him and comb his hair while he was distracted, either texting on his phone, napping, or watching highlights of his favorite basketball team on the couch. This always seemed to upset him, so I didn't do it very often.

I admittedly didn't know too much about his past throughout our short-lived relationship, but he never really spoke about it up until the end. Maybe it was my selfish desire to learn more about him that kept me around. I don't know what I saw in him, but for a while, it was nice. He approached me at a friend's party, I gotta say, around the summer of '99. He smelled good. *Really* good, like cedarwood and roses. He complimented me on my dress and my how I looked amazing in it. He looked at me with those soft, studying eyes. He was much more confident than most guys who approached me at bars or other parties, and I was quickly drawn into his romantic trap. We slept together that night. Looking back, I really don't know what I was thinking, but it took me by surprise how quickly my life changed afterward.

A year after we had been together, we moved into his apartment in South Austin. We lived there for another year. He never really cleaned up after himself, but he played the excuse that he was busy working all the time and was always tired when he returned home. We had a pretty rocky start, as most young couples do, and Austin was far more expensive than other, more suitable places in Texas. David always managed to barely scrape by at the last second when bills were due. After a while of realizing I would have to start working to help with rent, I began putting in job applications. As a 19-year-old college student, I could hardly afford any time to work, but I knew I could start somewhere as a part-time employee. Shouldn't be too hard.

David said he worked for his dad's construction company as the co-founder and that they had several employees, but this raised suspicion with me, as he began bringing home only around $600-750 every month, which was far less than minimum wage in 2003. His normal wage was about $2000 monthly, but he said that the company had to cut funding because of a boycott at the company.

One day, as I was sitting on the couch studying calculus in my school book, I felt curious and decided to pay David a visit. I don't know what got into me that day. Maybe curiosity got the better of me, but I was right to trust my gut. I made a batch of fudge brownies for him and his cohorts before I left the apartment. I drove downtown where he said he was working—""Colleen's Construction"" down Pearce Lane past Austin. He said they named the business after their late mother, Colleen, who had passed away when David was a child.

I pulled into the construction site and found a muddy acre of land surrounded with engineer tape. There were several workers lollygagging around the perimeter of the site, smoking cigarettes and talking amongst themselves. I shyly approached the group of workers, batch of brownies in hand, and asked if David had clocked in for work that day. I said that he was the co-founder of the company, to which the group of workers all shot me blank looks of confusion, making me immediately blush in embarrassment.

""Wait, I'm sorry, you mean Colleen Thatcher? The old woman who lives in West Lake Hills in a big mansion with her kids?"" one of them asked.

He asked if I was a friend of the owner's, to which I didn't know how to respond. I stared at the ground, blushing profusely, trying to escape the conversation somehow.

""I... I don't know. I'm sorry to have bothered you guys,"" I said.

The man in the front, holding a cup of coffee, looked at me with compassion and responded in a quiet, respectful tone. ""Hey, look. If you want me to ask my boss if your boyfriend is here, I could gladly do that. But I don't think we know anyone named David. There's only about 15 of us on this whole site during the day, but the rest of 'em already clocked out early. We clock out at 8. Maybe I can visit the boss before I head out?""

I abruptly responded, ""No, no, it's totally fine. I'm sure there's another site nearby I could look.""

He apologized profusely and waved me goodbye as I turned to walk away. I stopped in my tracks for a moment before turning back around to ask, ""Hey! You guys want some brownies?""

The workers stared down at the tray I was holding for a few seconds before two of them turned and made eye contact with one another.

""We would actually... fuckin' love some brownies right about now.""

I walked back over with a big smile, and before I knew it, the tray was cleaned off. The workers thanked me wholeheartedly as I waved them goodbye.

""We love you!"" one of the guys cheered loudly, as I let out a small chuckle.

I gave one last polite smile to the workers and entered my car as they waved me goodbye. I entered my car and couldn't help but stare down in confusion. Where the hell was David?

I began driving back to our apartment, but as I was parked at a stoplight, I flipped open my phone and stared at David's contact number. Wherever he was, I just wanted to know he wasn't spinning some tale or lying to me completely. I hesitated for a moment before pressing call. A few seconds of ringing went by, and he picked up the phone with that same exhausted tone in his voice, as if he were in the middle of a heavy project that need his attention""

""Hello?"" David asked.

I sucked in a deep breath through my teeth and put on a fake smile to help shift my tone so I didn't sound worried. ""Hey, baby. What time did you say you were getting back today?"" I asked jovially.

David hesitated for a minute, and I could hear him tapping his finger on the back of his phone, as if searching for a cop-out response to my question.

""Uhmmm. Not sure yet. Me and the guys gotta remodel this kitchen, and it's looking like it'll be a big project. I might be home a little late tonight, but I'll do my best to get done quick so I'm not late for dinner.""

I glanced down at my watch. It was already 8:05. I may be a little naive, but I'm smart enough to remember those construction workers saying they'd be clocked out of work by now.

I hesitated again, taking a heavy breath through my nose, trying to hold back tears as I collected myself once more to respond. ""Alright. See you tonight."" My voice quivered slightly. I thought David would notice my clearly worried disposition, but he just simply responded in that same rushed voice.

""Alright, baby. Gotta get back to work, but I'll see you tonight. Love you!""

I held the phone to my ear, his last words echoing in my mind. I hung up the phone without saying a word. I kept driving and sat my phone in my lap, those last words ringing in my ears: ""I love you.""

Without skipping a beat, he called me again. At this point, I was mildly upset. I flipped my phone open and pressed it to my ear.

""Hello?"" I asked, keeping my voice as calm and collected as I could.

""You didn't say I love you back,"" he said.

I began frowning and tilted my head in confusion. A moment of silence passed between us before he said, IIII Loooove Youuuuu""

I took a heavy sigh through my nose and puffed out my chest. ""David. I'm not playing this game with you.""

David softly gasped, taken aback. He waited a moment before responding nervously. ""Taylor?""

I retorted quickly, ""I don't know where you are or what you're doing, but I know you're not at that construction site. So, where are you?""

Moments passed, and he didn't say a word. After giving him the floor for several seconds, he began to respond. ""I-I don't... Taylor!""

I interrupted him before he could finish his thought. ""I'm giving you 20 minutes to come home.""

At this point, he began raising his voice. ""Whoa! H-Hold on—""

I hung up before he could finish his thought. I wanted to feel a sense of pride in what I did, but I couldn't help but feel guilty about reprimanding David like that. After all, he could just need some alone time away from the house. It was getting late, so maybe I was just worried he'd be out until 12 a.m. again. I loved him and didn't want to see him upset, so I began to contemplate calling back and apologizing.

But this wasn't the first time he'd lied. This is a recurring problem that we never bring up, and now is the time. I shook off the feeling of regret quickly and pressed the gas pedal harder, banking a left to return home. I drove for what felt like an eternity, but I arrived home in as little as 10 minutes.

As I pulled into my apartment building, I didn’t notice David's black Volkswagen parked in the front, so I shut off my engine and sat in the car, waiting for him to return. It was dark, and all I could think about was, ""Who is he with right now?"" I quickly shook off the thought. A few minutes later, I saw his car pull into the parking lot of our old apartment complex. He was shuffling around, reaching over his passenger's seat. I didn't know what he was messing with, but he was clearly trying to hide something from me. I noticed he wasn’t sporting any type of neon vest or a hard hat, like the workers I spoke to at the construction site. He was just wearing his black ""LA"" cap and a black hoodie.

I got out of my car and began walking up to his car, hands at my sides and trembling. I had not prepared what I was going to say to him in advance, so only one question came to my mind. As he parked his car and swung the door open, walking over to meet me in the parking lot, the first thing I asked was, ""What's in the glove compartment?""

David stopped in front of me, hands in his jacket pockets, lips curled up into a sarcastic half-smile. He pulled his arms out of his pockets and threw them up to his side. I folded my arms in contempt. We stared at each other for a few more moments before I folded my hands into fists and began marching over to his car.

David stepped in front of me and put his hands in front of me, cautious not to touch me. ""Taylor. I just want to talk to y—""

I brushed past him quickly and approached his passenger's side door.

""Taylor, stop!"" he began raising his voice, but I didn’t respond. I opened his door, and I was immediately blasted with the smell of weed. I knew David smoked, and I never had a problem with it, but it seemed unreasonable to believe he was smoking during work. I wouldn’t put it past him, though.

There was nothing in the passenger’s seat. David just stood back with his hands folded in his pockets. I could tell he wanted to say something, but he just stood there silently and took a deep breath, staring at me as I reached into his glove compartment. Inside were a bunch of registration papers, a birth certificate, and other things that he brought to the DMV when he leased the car.

""You see? What were you expecting to find, Taylor?""

I noticed a rolled-up sheet of paper tucked away in the back of the compartment. I unwrapped the paper, and inside revealed a small bag with a substance that looked like salt crystals. However, I knew it wasn’t that. I simply froze in disbelief. It wasn’t disbelief in what I saw, but it was disbelief in myself—that I would get myself in this kind of situation.

I gently placed the bag back where I found it and softly shut his car door, leaving my hand on his window.

""Construction, huh?"" I asked sarcastically, but my voice was quivering too much to sound serious.

David didn’t move an inch and looked at me with a serious expression. ""We need the money, Taylor,"" he said matter-of-factly, as he kept his hands tucked away in his pockets. ""We’re already late on our lease, and we can hardly afford groceries. Taylor...""

He walked over and placed a gentle hand on my shoulder as I stared into the window of his car. ""I fucking love you, ya know that?""

I threw my shoulder back, releasing his hand. Tears were streaming down my face by this point. I glanced back at him one last time.

""The lease is yours now, David,"" I said. I turned to walk back upstairs to our room. ""I don’t want any more of your excuses.""

David began marching towards me, shouting at this point. ""What the fuck do you think you're doing, T?""

I was on the verge of sobbing. I felt so naive and gullible for ever trusting David with my feelings. He never shared anything about himself, but at this point, I knew everything I needed to know. David grabbed my shoulder before I reached the door.

""Don't fucking touch me!"" I retorted.

David let go of my shoulder, and I opened the door. I stared in disgust and disbelief at the disheveled mess that I had left. No... that *we* had left. I couldn’t believe I was ever okay with living like this. David followed closely behind me as I walked over to our room and reached into our closet, pulling out a suitcase. David just sat and watched as I began emptying my dresser, tossing handfuls of clothing into the suitcase.

David grabbed my wrist with force as I was reaching into the dresser. ""What the fuck are you doing, David?""

He jerked my hand back and began pulling me over to the other side of the room. He was a large man, so I couldn’t do anything but thrash and scream as he overpowered me. I punched him in the mouth and screamed for help. He lifted me up off my feet and shoved me onto our bed. I shut my eyes in terror for a few seconds and heard a distinct metallic click.

I slowly raised my eyes back up to meet David's. He raised his handgun at me and had a cold, blank expression across his face. I threw my hands over my face and began sobbing loudly, begging for help.

""Please stop, please, don't do this, no, no, please, just stop!""

David interrupted my loud pleading and waved his gun at me. ""Alright, alright, just shut the fuck up!""

I stopped crying and began breathing heavily, keeping a guarding hand over my face. David shouted, ""Who the fuck do you think paid for this bed? These sheets? The fucking food in the fridge? Me! I'm the one who does *everything* in this fucking place while you slouch around doing jack shit! And now I'm going to lose you for trying to make a living for us? Who the fuck do you think you are? Ungrateful bitch!""

David had tears welling up in his eyes. He sobbed and wiped the tears from his face before remorsefully saying, ""I fucking loved you, T!""

David puffed out his chest and aimed the gun towards me. ""Now, I'm gonna lose the one person I ever loved!"" His voice lowered to a soft tremble as his upper lip quivered. He stared back at me with tears streaming down his face, sniffling.

I lowered my guard for a second before responding. ""David. I-I'm so sorry. Please, put the gun down. We can talk about this.""

David wiped the tears from his eyes. ""What more is there to talk about?""

I sat up from the bed and crawled towards David. ""We can start over. Find a different route. I... I don't know how we're gonna do it, but we always make it through *everything*. Me and you, David. We're not going anywhere.""

I looked up to lock eyes with David. I expected some sense of warmth in his eyes or for him to lower his guard, but he just shot back a cocky grin as he put the muzzle to my head.

""Lies, lies, all these fucking lies! How the fuck do you sleep with yourself at night? You fucking disgust me! All this dribble, all this banter, and you're still just gonna fucking leave the second I walk out that door! No! We're done talk—""

Our conversation was suddenly interrupted by a loud crash in the living room. Apparently, in David's fit of rage, he didn't notice he had left the blinds open for the neighbors to see us. David quickly pointed his weapon at the door and began firing as he shuffled towards the closet. I could do nothing but roll out of the bed onto the ground, curling up, shutting my eyes, and screaming in horror as glass from the window shattered and bullets whizzed above my head.

Men from outside the window were shooting in. David took shelter in the closet, and I could see him staring in the direction of the window as he reloaded his magazine. He slowly turned his head to make eye contact with me, that same cocky grin stretched across his face. I widened my eyes in horror.

Suddenly, my vision was blinded, and my ears began ringing loudly as the sound of a loud bang flooded the walls of the room. I cupped my hands over my ears and screamed as loud as I could, but I could not hear my own screams over the deafening ring. I could hear muffled voices a few feet from me over the bed.

""Put the fucking gun down!"" one of them shouted.

I squinted open my eyes and could make out three silhouettes surrounding the closet where David was holed up. As if the world itself had stopped, I looked at David once again. His curly hair flowed like a gentle breeze, and his eyes were kind and compassionate. He stared at me with an immense look of remorse, as if he were asking me for help. His hands were outstretched, above his head. Time seemed to move in slow motion.

One of the officers moved in to approach David, instructing him to stay calm. David gave me one last hopeless plea for help and jerked his head back towards the officer, swinging the muzzle of his handgun forward, closing his eyes. In an instant, David pulled the trigger. He shot the officer.

Loud bangs began to ring out across the room as David launched back towards the wall of the closet. I screamed in horror as an officer quickly rushed in to subdue David. The officer who had been shot was hunched over at the foot of the bed, wincing in pain as he held his chest. Another man rushed in to check on the officer.

""Are you hurt?"" the man asked.

""He got my plates,"" the officer replied.

The man in the closet, subduing David, held his arm, checking David's pulse. ""Response team to dispatch, suspect is down, needs immediate medical. One officer wounded, but responsive."" He slowly glanced back at me. ""One civilian responsive. How copy?""

His radio chimed back. ""Response team, Medical is standing by. Clear house and let the paramedics in. Great work.""

As I stared into the closet, I saw David. His eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling, as he took short, labored breaths and he held his hand against his stomach. Blood soaked his hoodie as he grasped tighter. He stared back down at me, breathing quickly, as he stretched a sickening grin across his face. He raised his arm slowly and pointed his thumb and finger at me, mimicking a gun.

The officer who had been shot stood in front of me, blocking David's glare, as he extended a hand towards me.

""Are you okay, ma'am?"" he asked.

I stared at him for a moment before taking his hand. He pulled me up to my feet and I stumbled forward, dizzy. He wrapped my arm around him as we began stumbling towards the living room. Behind me, I could hear David slowly gurgling.

""Don't... t-touch... her...""

I attempted to look back before the officer pulled me forward, towards the exit. ""C'mon. Let's get you out of here.""

As we stumbled out of the exit, the officer slowly let me go. I wobbled to my feet a bit, but I could stand on my own. The ringing in my ears did not subside as the officer spoke. His voice sounded robotic, as if speaking through a fan.

""I know you've seen a lot, but we're gonna make it up to you, okay? The medics downstairs are going to take good care of you. I'll walk you down,"" he said.

I looked down to see the paramedics rushing upstairs, carrying a stretcher. Neighbors peeked in through their blinds, watching through their windows. One woman next door opened her door to see what was going on. The officer yelled back at her, ""Ma'am, could you please stay in your home?""

She gave me a hesitant, frightful look before ducking back into her apartment. I then realized that david had shot through our living room, right through the wall where the woman lived. Even in my predicament, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the woman. The officer placed a gentle hand on the small of my back as he guided me downstairs toward the ambulance that was waiting for me.

The paramedic shouted from the back of the ambulance. ""Hey, Ramirez! You get shot?""

Officer Ramirez waved his hand dismissively before shouting back, ""Nah, I'm good! But she needs medical attention!""

The paramedic yelled from the ambulance. ""Like hell you're good! Get'cher ass in here! *Now!*""

Officer Ramirez shot me a sarcastic grin, as to say, ""this guy over here,"" before helping me up into the ambulance and climbing in behind me. The medics checked my vitals, eyes, and ears to make sure I wasn't hurt. They asked me a bunch of questions and soon told me they were taking me to the hospital nearby.

I shot them a worried expression. ""Don't worry,"" one of the medics said. ""You don't gotta pay for the ambulance.""

The medic shot a look toward Ramirez. ""This is coming out of your paycheck though.""

Ramirez rolled his eyes and jeered. ""Ah, fuck off, man.""

Hearing the back-and-forth banter, I managed to let out a pained chuckle. As we pulled into the hospital, my mom and dad were both waiting outside the emergency room entrance. They were both visibly crying and rushed in quickly to embrace me, both kissing me on the forehead and cradling me tight.

""My girl, my baby girl,"" Dad said, sobbing through his words.

The medics asked them to move aside and walked me into the building. Mom and Dad followed closely behind. I was met with two doctors, who instructed me that they were going to perform some tests to make sure I was safe and unharmed. They walked me into a room with a padded bed with a long sheet of blue paper draped over the top. They asked me a few questions about how I felt, asked if I had any pain, and told me they'd be back in a few minutes before exiting the room, leaving me, my mom, and my dad.

My dad sat up straight in his chair with his fists clenching his jeans. His cocked to the side and he had a vengeful glare in his eyes. My mother tried asking me what happened in the apartment, but I knew telling them would make my situation worse. She eventually stopped asking questions and just sat next to me, hugging me tight and stroking my disheveled hair, telling me that everything would be okay.

After half an hour, a beautiful, skinny nurse with blonde hair tied into a bun peeked into the room and asked if it was okay if she could collect a sample from me. Hesitating, I nodded my head. I got up and followed the nurse into a bathroom across the hall, where I collected the sample and left it on a small labeled shelf inside the bathroom.

As I opened the door, the nurse greeted me with a gleaming smile, standing on her tippy toes with her hands behind her back. ""This way, please."" She guided me back to the room where I could hear my dad yelling at the top of his lungs. ""He better hope he's fucking dead!""

I peeked into the room through the closed, opaque glass door and saw the silhouette of my dad, pacing back and forth in the room, arms flailing as he screamed. ""What he did to my daughter... No! I'm gonna fucking--"" I saw my mom place her hands on his back, urging him to calm down.

I looked over past my room and saw what looked to be 2 tall, Hispanic men in black hoodies, staring from across the hall, around a corner. They weren't staring at what was happening in the room, but instead, made eye contact with me. They noticed me looking back at them and they slowly turned back and disappeared around the corner.

Was I imagining things? Were those men looking at me? I quickly brushed off those thoughts and rushed in to meet my dad. My mom was trying desperately to calm him as he turned around and saw me.

""Dad. Please.""

He heaved heavily for a few moments before I heard a man's voice behind me. ""Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to lower your voice. There are other patients here.""

I turned around to see my doctor in a white lab coat with a security guard peeking from behind his shoulder. My dad was hunched over, breathing heavy, furious breaths, as he eyed the doctor. Dad stood up straight, took a deep heavy breath, and cleared his throat.

""Right... Right. Sorry.""

The guard left the room, and the doctor respectfully explained that the nurse would be back in five minutes. I sat down on the bed next to my mom as my dad sat in the back of the room on a chair. He clenched his jeans again and sat in silence.

A few minutes went by, and the nurse peeked in from the door, apologizing for intruding. She was visibly shaken, but asked me to have a conversation with her outside of the room. I looked back at my dad, who had relaxed his arms. ""It's okay, sweetie."" He nodded, and we stepped out into the hallway.

The nurse looked down at the floor. She had a nervous grin, but I could tell she was trying to maintain her composure. She took a deep breath through her nose and looked at me.

""Ms. Welch,"" she said in a serious tone. ""Your lab results are still pending, but we have some news about the urine sample you provided for us.""

I hesitated and awaited her next words. She reached around and grabbed my hand, placing a small sheet of paper in my palm. I hurredly glanced through the page, and stumbled across 3 words that shook me to my core.

This sub helped me quite a lot when it came to picking out which online roasters to buy from after trying all local options. These were purchased to 1) give myself a break from roasting coffee as I transition to a larger roaster & 2) maintain an idea of what goes for specialty on the market. I am especially excited to try S&W as I have seen them highly recommended on this sub. I've tried all offerings from the local shops in my area, and their dark roasts/blends have been very lackluster. I'd be very open to any excellent med-dark to dark roast suggestions as well! Happy 2024.

I think it smells like a coffee shop (90%) with a little bit of chocolate in it (10%). I typically use it when I'm just going out anywhere like a store, restaurant, etc. It lasts all day with just one spray making the fragrance last longer because you don't need to spray it multiple times. I learned this the hard way when I sprayed it like a cologne, this made me dizzy and lightheaded, so whatever you do don't spray more than one, maybe 2 if you're a woman. Overall I think this is a great fragrance, and it comes in at about $30 (USD) on Amazon. 

Side note: I don't know if everybody else already knows/ does this, but I spray one spritz of it in my room and then turn on the fan. This makes it smell like a candle of whatever fragrance you have without the hassle of the candle. The scent goes away after 24 hours.

I found one video on YouTube that rated the De'Longhi higher because of the insulated steam wand, and that was about it.

From what I can see, both are very similar, the auto dosing on the breville might be useful, but the insulated steam wand is probably more time saving.

I'm looking into an all in one due to space constraints in the kitchen. Having a single appliance will free up a power outlet for me, and keep things a bit tidier.

Are there any really strong reasons to favour one over the other, or are they both close enough that I'm unlikely to pick the difference as someone who appreciates a good espresso, but isn't typically buying single origin beans.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become an increasingly popular cosmetic treatment. Many individuals explore various methods to enhance their smiles, from over-the-counter products to professional dental procedures. In the age of social media, ""teeth whitening before and after pictures"" are a powerful tool for influencing consumer choices. These images showcase the dramatic transformations that can occur with whitening treatments and resonate with potential customers on a personal level.

The visual appeal of before and after images cannot be overstated. Seeing an actual person’s smile change from dull to dazzling engages viewers. When consumers look at these images, they can visualize their results, helping them connect emotionally with the treatment. Not only do these pictures demonstrate effectiveness, but they also build trust in the product or service being showcased. Here are a few ways these images impact consumer choices:

- **Authenticity:** Customers appreciate real-life transformations. Before and after pictures add authenticity to marketing campaigns, making it easier for potential customers to believe in the product's effectiveness.
- **Motivation:** These images can serve as a source of motivation. If a person sees a friend or a social media influencer achieve remarkable results, they may feel encouraged to try the same treatment.
- **Social Proof:** Consumers often look for reassurance before making a purchase. When they see many successful before and after photos, it creates a sense of consensus regarding the efficacy of teeth whitening products. This phenomenon, known as social proof, is a strong motivator in consumer decision-making.
- **Understanding Expectations:** Before and after pictures help manage consumer expectations. They visually depict possible results, allowing customers to understand what to realistically expect from a teeth whitening procedure.

The importance of high-quality images should not be overlooked. Clear, well-lit pictures that show genuine results are far more effective than amateur photos. When images are too edited or enhanced, they can lose credibility. Authenticity is key; consumers want to see results that are relatable and achievable. When these conditions are met, the impact on consumer choice becomes even more significant.

Additionally, the influence of social media cannot be denied. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook thrive on visual content, and many teeth whitening brands leverage this to showcase real transformations. Influencer partnerships can amplify the reach of these images. When influencers post status updates or stories featuring their teeth whitening journey, their followers are often inclined to try the same method.

It's important to note that some ethics guide the use of such images in marketing. Brands must avoid using misleading before and after pictures. Misrepresentation can lead to distrust and negative reviews, ultimately damaging a brand's reputation. Transparency is essential, and brands should consider including disclaimers or information about the methods used in the images. This approach can further enhance both credibility and trust.

When it comes to consumer choices, the relevance of teeth whitening before and after pictures is undeniable. They educate potential customers, answer questions, and reduce doubts about the treatment process. As a consumer, when you see these images, you might start to consider what a brighter smile could do for your confidence and social interactions.

Furthermore, there are numerous platforms where consumers exchange their experiences and share before and after pictures. Sites like Reddit or specialized dental forums allow customers to post reviews, share their outcomes, and provide tips on various whitening methods. This community feedback loop not only validates the effectiveness of certain products but also encourages ongoing conversations about teeth whitening options.

In your own journey towards a whiter smile, remember to research various products and treatments. Look for before and after pictures that resonate with you and seem relatable. It doesn’t hurt to keep in mind personal testimonials and experiences shared by others to guide your choices. Achieving a brighter smile can have a lasting impact on your self-esteem and overall appearance, making it worthwhile to explore the best options available.

The influence of teeth whitening before and after pictures extends beyond mere aesthetics. They play a pivotal role in shaping consumer behavior and decision-making. When you integrate these visuals into your dental hygiene journey, you not only empower yourself with knowledge and inspiration but also join a broader community eager to share in the pursuit of a radiant smile.

Understanding the Science Behind Teeth Whitening Products
---------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening products have gained immense popularity recently, with many seeking bright, white smiles. But have you ever wondered what makes these products effective? Understanding the science behind teeth whitening can help you make informed decisions about your dental care.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
At the heart of teeth whitening is the process of oxidation. Most whitening products contain bleaching agents, commonly hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These compounds work by breaking down stains on the enamel, the outer layer of your teeth, and this leads to a brighter appearance. Here’s how the process typically unfolds:

- **Application:** The whitening agent is applied to the teeth, often using a tray, strip, or pen.
- **Penetration:** The bleaching agent penetrates the enamel, targeting deeper stains.
- **Oxidation:** When the agent breaks down, it releases oxygen molecules that react with the stains, effectively lifting them away.

Different products use varying concentrations of these bleaching agents. Over-the-counter solutions may have lower concentrations, making them safer but possibly less effective. Conversely, professional treatments administered by a dentist often use higher concentrations, leading to quicker results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
It's essential to understand that not all stains are the same, and the effectiveness of these products can depend on the type of discoloration you are facing:

- **Extrinsic Stains:** These come from plaque, foods, and beverages like coffee or tea. They reside on the surface and may be easier to remove with whitening products.
- **Intrinsic Stains:** These originate from within the tooth, often due to genetics, aging, or trauma. They can be more challenging to address and may require more time or professional treatment to resolve.

Another crucial factor in the effectiveness of teeth whitening is the enamel quality. As you age, your enamel naturally wears down, which may lead to increased sensitivity and make whitening less effective. Therefore, maintaining good oral hygiene and regular check-ups is vital for optimal results.

Many people have misconceptions about teeth whitening products. For example, some believe that a whiter smile ensures better dental health. However, it's important to realize that while cosmetic whitening can enhance the aesthetics of your teeth, it does not address underlying health issues, such as cavities or gum disease. It is always best to consult with your dentist first.

While pondering about the right teeth whitening product for you, consider these guidelines:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Consultation:** Speak with your dentist about your teeth's condition and the best whitening option.
- **Consumer Reviews:** Read reviews and before-and-after pictures to gauge the effectiveness of different products.
- **Take Time:** Allow adequate time for the whitening treatment to work. Many products yield results after multiple sessions.

Side effects are possible with whitening treatments, including heightened tooth sensitivity and gum irritation. These are usually temporary but can deter some from continuing with the process. If you experience discomfort, consider adjusting how often you use the product or speak with a dental professional for alternatives that may be gentler.

The advancements in dental technology have led to new innovations in teeth whitening. Many brands are now offering LED treatment options that claim to accelerate the whitening process. The science behind these claims often involves using light energy to activate the whitening agent more efficiently, potentially reducing the time you need to achieve satisfactory results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
It's also worth emphasizing the importance of lifestyle choices after whitening. To maintain your new smile, consider minimizing the intake of staining foods and drinks. Regular dental cleanings and good oral hygiene go a long way in preserving your brighter smile.

While teeth whitening products can significantly enhance the brightness of your smile through science-based principles, understanding how these products work allows you to use them effectively and responsibly. Whether you choose over-the-counter options or professional treatments, informed choices will always lead to the best results and future smiles.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening before and after pictures play a crucial role in shaping consumer decisions. They serve as a powerful visual testament to the effectiveness of various whitening products, effectively influencing potential buyers. When you see striking transformations, it can spark excitement and hope about achieving a radiant smile yourself. These images not only highlight the potential results of a treatment but also offer proof of success from real users, making them a vital part of the purchasing process for many.

Understanding the science behind teeth whitening products is equally important.

I took the first on in November and had just used Plural Sight and their testing information. I honestly didn’t know much about the test, what to expect , or how to study but I have a plethora of certs as I have needed them over the years and didn’t think much of this. I studied the plural site questions upwards of 800 in their test bank and took my first exam in November, failed at 150.
So after the fail I had a scope of the test and found this subreddit and I appreciate all of your stories and sharing your methods. I bought the isc2 Cissp 9th gen book and registered for the Wiley online testing. While reading I figured I’d do some more PluralSight test banks, and realized the questions and answers at the bottom stated the answers came from the 5th generation book.
So let me say, do not use Plural Sight. If your work provides the training the videos are fine, but the test bank is old and outdated.
So I spent December listening to the audiobook or flipping through the book and answering the end of chapter questions and answering the practice exams, while rereading the questions I missed and restudying that content.
I got a cup of coffee, ensured I was hydrated, no breaks, just powered through.
At 100 questions I thought I had to be close, I understood the content, but the constant gotcha questions. Some of the data I had experience in but had to just make and educated guess. The book only covered what this is, not how this works, and a lot of questions were, given the tool, how does this work in this situation. It’s frustrating. I took a deep breath at 100 and kept going. Questions became easier and more of what I would expect from reading the book, and at 150 I passed. 27 years in IT, Cis Degree, executive level and what a tough exam. I appreciate all of your input and hope this helps someone who fails, uses PluralSight or questions things at question 101.",2,1735357711.0,cissp,1,1.0,False

""Little transgression? They attacked me in an alley way...That was after YOUR son inappropriately groped me the day before."" Kimi retorted narrowing her eyes. 

""I understand your frustration Ms. Wayland but let's not blow this out of proportion. You're young right now but one day you'll understand that sometimes it's better to just let some things go."" Mr. Scott replied sitting back in his chair. 

""""Don't blow it out of proportion?"" ""Let it go?"" Hahahaha."" Kimi started laughing hysterically and loudly. 

People started staring as Mr. Scott looked around irritably. Mr. Burgess returned with Mr. Scott's coffee and bagel with a worried look etched across his handsome face as he looked at Kimi worriedly. Kimi continued laughing leaning her head back, her face reddening

Abruptly Kimi stopped and stared coldly at Mr. Scott. Her sudden shift in look startling him. 

""What's highly inappropriate is you offering to pay me to ""forget"" that your son is a rapist freak who can't understand the word no."" Kimi stated coldly and firmly. 

""Ms. Wayland...I want you to think of this as a business agreement and nothing more. I'm not excusing Wyatt's behavior, however, I need to protect my company and I know a young woman like yourself could use some money. What I'm offering is an opportunity to be set after graduation. That's something many people don't have but wish they did."" Mr. Scott replied picking up his coffee cup and taking a small sip. 

""Should I thank you for your gracious offer?"" Kimi asked sarcastically. 

""No, I just hope we can come to an agreement...of course, you'll need to sign a non-disclosure agreement.""

Kimi's anger grew. She balled up her fist before relaxing her hand and pasting a wide and creepy smile across her beautiful face. 

""Let me think about it okay."" She said getting up from her chair. 

""Ms. Wayland, we were hoping to come to an agreement today!"" Mr. Burgess said desperately. 

Kimi shot a cold look his way that sent chills down his spine. 

""That's fine, all business agreements require consideration. I just hope you don't do anything rash Ms. Wayland. It won't be good for either of us."" Mr. Scott said coldly biting his bagel.

He's threatening me! This piece of shit is actually threatening me! Kimi thought. She made eye contact with Mr. Scott and glared at him blankly. She gave him a small grin before walking away. She didn't bother turning around as she made her way out of the coffee shop and down the long corridor. She grabbed her phone and ordered a Uber. Several were in the area and she got a rider 2 minutes away. By the time she exited the building the car was pulling up. Kimi got in, finally looking behind her to find Mr. Burgess staring at her with a worried expression across his face. 

Kimi leaned her head back in the car seat and closed her eyes to calm herself. I'll find a way to make all of you pieces of garbage pay for this she thought. Kimi opened her eyes and opened her purse. She pulled out her phone and smiled. She cut off her recording app. 

Darien waited nervously outside Kimi's apartment. He had recorded a nerve wrecking conversation between Mr. Scott and Mr. Ryan  minutes ago where Mr. Scott complained that Kimi might be an issue, and that he might need to find a way to deal with her. Deal with her? What does he mean, that piece of shit Darien thought. He paced back and forth anxiously. He knew that Kimi was going to go see Mr. Scott and he hoped Mr. Scott didn't do anything he shouldn't. He was still collecting evidence and was disgusted and surprised by what he had found so far. He needed everything to move smoothly...it was the only way to protect Kimi.

Kimi walked around the corner to find Darien standing by the staircase leading up to her apartment. She was irritated by her meeting with Mr. Scott and didn't feel up to visitors. Darien watched her with worry on his face. 

""Kimi, you're back...are you okay?!"" He asked. 

""Yeah, why wouldn't I be okay?"" Kimi asked looking at him weirdly.

Darien began fidgeting with his hands before stuffing them in the pockets of his shorts. 

""I...I was just worried, that's all."" He replied sheepishly. 

""Okay...Well, I'm fine but I'm in a bad mood and don't feel up to hanging out today so can we talk later?"" Kimi said firmly as she walked by Darien and started up the stairs. 

Suddenly Darien grabbed her hand on the handrails causing her to pause. She looked at him with a frown that stung his heart. 

""What are you doing?"" She asked angrily. 

""Kimi...I have something important to tell you.""

""Whatever it is, it can wait."" Kimi said snatching her hand and walking up a couple of more stairs. 

""I sent the video!"" Darien yelled out only enough for Kimi to hear. 

Kimi stopped and stood frozen in place on the stairs. She didn't move or turn around. 

""I went out for a run and saw what was happening...I took the video to gather evidence so they couldn't lie when I took action but...but you didn't need me so...""

Kimi spun around and walked back down the stairs stopping before reaching the bottom so she could be at eye level with Darien. 

""So you creepily sent me a video and their names and said nothing until now? How did you know I was out this morning? Why did you ask was I okay Darien?"" Kimi asked in a calmness that sent chills down Darien's spine. 

He decided to be partially honest. ""I might have sent your attackers a video with spyware that gave me access to their calls and parent's phones...and I might have overheard Wyatt Scott call his father about you."" Darien said swallowing hard. 

""So you've been spying on me too?"" Kimi asked angrily. 

""No and what I did was to protect you! I swear Kimi...I would never do anything to harm you, NEVER!"" He said desperately. 

""Protect me? I can protect myself!"" 

""Kimi, these people are dangerous. I've uncovered some other information...I just want you to be cautious.""

""Why are you doing this Darien? What made you think this was okay?"" Kimi asked angrily. 

""Like I said...I want to protect you.""

""Who asked you to do that?!""

""No one, I just want to!"" Darien replied frustrated. 

""What for?! You don't know me.""

""I know I want to protect you.""

""Answer me honestly or we're going to have a serious problem, and trust me Darien, you don't want that."" Kimi responded coldly. 

""Fine... I like you Kimi...I really like you. I've liked you from the first moment I saw you. I knew then I would do anything for you."" Darien said feeling embarrassed, his face and neck turning red. 

Kimi walked down the remaining stairs and stood in front of him. Her heart racing and a mixture of confusion, angier, caution and intrigue rolling around inside of her mind and chest. 

""You know nothing about the kind of person I really am."" She said looking up at him. 

""I don't care. I like you...I want to protect you and...and be with you."" 

Kimi made eye contact with him. Darien's face was still flushed. A small amount of sweat was forming on his forehead. Kimi thought about his clinginess and how he always blocked her from being around other guys when he was around. She wasn't ignorant to his feelings but she didn't realize how deep they had gotten in such a short time. This could be dangerous. She didn't want or need any entanglements right now. However, she was interested in what Darien had hoped to accomplish by taking the video and spying on her attackers. 

""You said you would do anything for me?"" Kimi asked softly. 

Darien's face and eyes lit up. ""Yes, anything."" He replied.

""Ms. Wayland...I want you to think of this as a business agreement and nothing more. I'm not excusing Wyatt's behavior, however, I need to protect my company and I know a young woman like yourself could use some money. What I'm offering is an opportunity to be set after graduation. That's something many people don't have but wish they did."" Mr. Scott replied picking up his coffee cup and taking a small sip. 

""Should I thank you for your gracious offer?"" Kimi asked sarcastically. 

""No, I just hope we can come to an agreement...of course, you'll need to sign a non-disclosure agreement.""

Kimi's anger grew. She balled up her fist before relaxing her hand and pasting a wide and creepy smile across her beautiful face. 

""Let me think about it okay."" She said getting up from her chair. 

""Ms. Wayland, we were hoping to come to an agreement today!"" Mr. Burgess said desperately. 

Kimi shot a cold look his way that sent chills down his spine. 

""That's fine, all business agreements require consideration. I just hope you don't do anything rash Ms. Wayland. It won't be good for either of us."" Mr. Scott said coldly biting his bagel.

He's threatening me! This piece of shit is actually threatening me! Kimi thought. She made eye contact with Mr. Scott and glared at him blankly. She gave him a small grin before walking away. She didn't bother turning around as she made her way out of the coffee shop and down the long corridor. She grabbed her phone and ordered a Uber. Several were in the area and she got a rider 2 minutes away. By the time she exited the building the car was pulling up. Kimi got in, finally looking behind her to find Mr. Burgess staring at her with a worried expression across his face. 

Kimi leaned her head back in the car seat and closed her eyes to calm herself. I'll find a way to make all of you pieces of garbage pay for this she thought. Kimi opened her eyes and opened her purse. She pulled out her phone and smiled. She cut off her recording app. 

Darien waited nervously outside Kimi's apartment. He had recorded a nerve wrecking conversation between Mr. Scott and Mr. Ryan  minutes ago where Mr. Scott complained that Kimi might be an issue, and that he might need to find a way to deal with her. Deal with her? What does he mean, that piece of shit Darien thought. He paced back and forth anxiously. He knew that Kimi was going to go see Mr. Scott and he hoped Mr. Scott didn't do anything he shouldn't. He was still collecting evidence and was disgusted and surprised by what he had found so far. He needed everything to move smoothly...it was the only way to protect Kimi.

Kimi walked around the corner to find Darien standing by the staircase leading up to her apartment. She was irritated by her meeting with Mr. Scott and didn't feel up to visitors. Darien watched her with worry on his face. 

""Kimi, you're back...are you okay?!"" He asked. 

""Yeah, why wouldn't I be okay?"" Kimi asked looking at him weirdly.

Darien began fidgeting with his hands before stuffing them in the pockets of his shorts. 

""I...I was just worried, that's all."" He replied sheepishly. 

""Okay...Well, I'm fine but I'm in a bad mood and don't feel up to hanging out today so can we talk later?"" Kimi said firmly as she walked by Darien and started up the stairs. 

Suddenly Darien grabbed her hand on the handrails causing her to pause. She looked at him with a frown that stung his heart. 

""What are you doing?"" She asked angrily. 

""Kimi...I have something important to tell you.""

""Whatever it is, it can wait."" Kimi said snatching her hand and walking up a couple of more stairs. 

""I sent the video!"" Darien yelled out only enough for Kimi to hear. 

Kimi stopped and stood frozen in place on the stairs. She didn't move or turn around. 

""I went out for a run and saw what was happening...I took the video to gather evidence so they couldn't lie when I took action but...but you didn't need me so...""

Kimi spun around and walked back down the stairs stopping before reaching the bottom so she could be at eye level with Darien. 

""So you creepily sent me a video and their names and said nothing until now? How did you know I was out this morning? Why did you ask was I okay Darien?"" Kimi asked in a calmness that sent chills down Darien's spine. 

He decided to be partially honest. ""I might have sent your attackers a video with spyware that gave me access to their calls and parent's phones...and I might have overheard Wyatt Scott call his father about you."" Darien said swallowing hard. 

""So you've been spying on me too?"" Kimi asked angrily. 

""No and what I did was to protect you! I swear Kimi...I would never do anything to harm you, NEVER!"" He said desperately. 

""Protect me? I can protect myself!"" 

""Kimi, these people are dangerous. I've uncovered some other information...I just want you to be cautious.""

""Why are you doing this Darien? What made you think this was okay?"" Kimi asked angrily. 

""Like I said...I want to protect you.""

""Who asked you to do that?!""

""No one, I just want to!"" Darien replied frustrated. 

""What for?! You don't know me.""

""I know I want to protect you.""

""Answer me honestly or we're going to have a serious problem, and trust me Darien, you don't want that."" Kimi responded coldly. 

""Fine... I like you Kimi...I really like you. I've liked you from the first moment I saw you. I knew then I would do anything for you."" Darien said feeling embarrassed, his face and neck turning red. 

Kimi walked down the remaining stairs and stood in front of him. Her heart racing and a mixture of confusion, angier, caution and intrigue rolling around inside of her mind and chest. 

""You know nothing about the kind of person I really am."" She said looking up at him. 

""I don't care. I like you...I want to protect you and...and be with you."" 

Kimi made eye contact with him. Darien's face was still flushed. A small amount of sweat was forming on his forehead. Kimi thought about his clinginess and how he always blocked her from being around other guys when he was around. She wasn't ignorant to his feelings but she didn't realize how deep they had gotten in such a short time. This could be dangerous. She didn't want or need any entanglements right now. However, she was interested in what Darien had hoped to accomplish by taking the video and spying on her attackers. 

""You said you would do anything for me?"" Kimi asked softly. 

Darien's face and eyes lit up. ""Yes, anything."" He replied.

""Actually Ms. Wayland I'm very serious. I understand how hard it is to be young and make money in today's world. Especially as a college student. I'm willing to pay you a healthy amount to forget about my son and his friend's little transgression."" Mr. Scott said seriously. 

""Little transgression? They attacked me in an alley way...That was after YOUR son inappropriately groped me the day before."" Kimi retorted narrowing her eyes. 

""I understand your frustration Ms. Wayland but let's not blow this out of proportion. You're young right now but one day you'll understand that sometimes it's better to just let some things go."" Mr. Scott replied sitting back in his chair. 

""""Don't blow it out of proportion?"" ""Let it go?"" Hahahaha."" Kimi started laughing hysterically and loudly. 

People started staring as Mr. Scott looked around irritably. Mr. Burgess returned with Mr. Scott's coffee and bagel with a worried look etched across his handsome face as he looked at Kimi worriedly. Kimi continued laughing leaning her head back, her face reddening

1hnx071,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1hnx071/my_manager_has_no_idea_what_shes_doing/,my manager has no idea what she's doing,"my manager got hired on as the manager over the summer, and since that time all but 2 people have quit and those two are considering quitting next. I actually only started working there a couple months after she got hired so she's the only manager I've known there but from what everyone had said the previous manager was really awesome and ran the shop very well. 

I really like all of my coworkers and I like the shop and workflow itself, and I absolutely love this line of work. working in coffee shops as a barista is what I've done for over 4 years, and I think this shop is awesome in its practices and all of our baristas genuinely care about the work and we all care about the shop and our regulars and our quality, and that is literally awesome. to preface, I love it here, it's JUST the manager that kind of ruins everything. 

she HAS had previous barista experience but she managed a bar before this, and we have all had to train her on the basics of coffee and dialing in and milk steaming. she still over aerates and burns the milk, and she does not have a grasp on dialing in and she never tastes the espresso. she doesn't properly clean any of the equipment and uses tools and chemicals on the espresso machine that shouldn't be used on it (bleach in the group heads for example) she also does not know the sizes of basic drink builds, ie. serving a cortado in an espresso cup (these are two different sized drinks) and serving cappuccinos in 8 oz cafe & to go cups (again, the milk ratio of these drinks IS the differentiating factor and it makes them two different drinks) 

a few days ago the espresso grinder ""broke"" after her shift. she said it broke and I took her word for it, it was spitting the espresso out as though it was fanning it out everywhere. we were very slow and I decided to take it apart and look at it and I realized that all it was, was just the declumper (plastic piece in it) had gotten bent, so I bent it back the right direction and it was fine. it was only then that she decided to admit that actually, she had broken it by ramming a rag up there in it. she also spent 2 days using one group head because the portafilter got stuck in the left one. it took 20 seconds for me to unstick it. she also broke the batch Mahlkonig grinder, threw away the part that came off of it, and decided not to tell anyone until 2 days ago. we are constantly out of prep ingredients, dish soap, floor cleaner, gloves, etc. because she sucks at inventory and then ""forgets"" to order the stuff. 2 months ago we actually started using ceremonial matcha and we got a bamboo whisk and foot. because it's a fragile tool, you have to treat the bamboo whisk very carefully and let it soak in hot water when you're using it. it has been TWO MONTHS and our whisk is completely broken, splintering off, and hair-like pieces of wood are coming off of it. I have seen her throwing it in the sink with heavy ceramic dishes, scrubbing it with the brush, grinding it into the matcha bowl, whisking undiluted honey with it, and leaving it dirty all day and never letting it soak. and she wonders why it's fucking breaking. it's literally not fit to use in drinks anymore bc customers are going to fucking drink bits of bamboo. 

she doesn't update our menu, she doesn't take anyone's syrup ideas except her own, she does not listen to anyone's feedback or constructive criticism, she's hired 3 new people in the past few months and has not trained them at all and they have been opening and closing by themselves after their 4th shifts. she complains that we are understaffed and when myself and another person have both asked her REPEATEDLY for full time hours, she says ""that helps a lot thanks!"" and then never schedules us for more than 27 hours. I quit my primary source of income in order to be full time here and since then she has scheduled me for 3-4 days a week and the only time I get 5 days a week is when I cover other peoples shifts, which happens more often than you would think because she literally ignores times off requests, and then bitches about the fact that people keep putting shifts up for grabs and that it's not her responsibility to find coverage for us, even though we LITERALLY REQUEST OFF 2+ weeks early. 

again, I quit my 45/hr a week job in order to be 30-35/hrs here because with average tips included they equaled out to be the same wage. I talked to her about this and she was super excited to have another full time employee. tips are half or more of my paycheck. and 8/10 shifts I work are closes, ie our slowest time. we close at 6, and after 2pm we are super dead, we might get 10-20 more customers for the day. so in other words, I am barely making any tips. and if I ever do get scheduled for an open, it is literally always a 6:30am clopen. one week my check was $200. the only week that I have ever worked 35 hrs there (because of insane circumstances) my check was $600, which is what I was making at my last job lol. I am barely covering my bills rn. 

and I am not the only one getting fucked over with the schedule. one of my coworkers has 2 other jobs and can only work certain days a week here, and the manager schedules her for days that she cannot work regularly and those shifts always have to go up for grabs. some people get ONE fucking day a week. nobody is getting the amount of hrs they want. and yet she still wants to hire even more people and thinks we're understaffed?? but won't give us more than 27 hrs?? she has also cut me early on several occasions, has said not to bother coming in because we are ""so slow"" on some days, she will come in or stay over to do ""manager work"" whatever that means, and she'll stay clocked in with just one other person on shift while she is sitting in the office getting nothing accomplished, but earning half the tips. she also schedules herself for the busiest times on the busiest days and she understaffs when she does that. I honest to god think that she is trying to maximize how many tips she gets and I truly do think that she tries to schedule other people in a way that they get less tips, myself included and my coworker who has also requested full time because we both always get the shit end of the stick when it comes to the schedule. 

I'm sorry I am just fucking baffled at how bad she is at her job and none of her immediate supervisors have said or done anything about it and they know the reason everyone else has quit is because of her. I don't think she likes the fact that we are constantly correcting her. I try to do it in the nicest ways possible that don't sound corrective or accusatory but more like cool suggestions and fun ideas. if you've ever worked food service and specifically if you've ever worked in a 3rd wave specialty coffee shop, you know that there are practices that are universal and basic and necessary and just IS the way things are done. and she doesn't know the most basic shit and won't listen to anyone. people will tell her how to do something and sometimes she says, ""that's a good idea!"" (and the  she never does it again) and it's not an ""idea"" it is Just the Way it's supposed to be done. 

a few weeks ago she actually took a week off and during that week the shop ran so smoothly, we stayed caught up on all of the prep, all of the stock, and all of the weekly tasks/cleaning. we rearranged things BACK to before she rearranged everything and it made workflow easier. for half the day we had nothing to do bc we already did everything. the first day she got back she moved everything back where she had it and the very next day we started running low on prep and got back into a spot where we can't keep up with tasks and cleaning and food prep and we are always out of something. as a side note, every time she's mid shift and I'm closing, she always says that all the prep is done and we don't need anything else, and then when I do the fridge inventory I realize that we are either out of several things or only have a few more servings. so it feels like she is constantly leaving me with a bunch of prep and fails to mention anything about it so I'm either scrambling to do it all or screwing over the opener if I don't. 

anyways. I just needed to bitch about that ",3,1735357287.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

coworker and have been working together for three years now. When she first started at the company, I was immediately drawn to her. Over the past three years, we’ve always shared awkward eye contact and seem to make eye contact regardless of the space we’re in.

Last year, I invited her to our company softball league game. She came and we chatted for a bit there. The following morning, our coworker (who works in the same department as her) approached me and said that you and she would make a great couple. I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Fast forward to earlier this year. I asked her for her number through the companies user chat, and she gave it to me. I ended up texting her, but our conversation was short-lived and didn’t lead to anything significant. However, we still chatted around the office occasionally.

A few weeks ago, we ended up at the same happy hour for one of our coworkers who was leaving the company. We chatted for about 45 minutes, discussing work and personal life. Ever since that day, I’ve noticed that I’m developing feelings for her again. In recent days, she’s brought up more personal topics in our conversations, and I feel like she’s more comfortable now. Our conversations aren’t just small talk around the office anymore.

However, I’m not sure if she’s interested in me or just being friendly. I’ve been thinking about texting her, but I haven’t since I first got her number. I also found out that her birthday is in a few days. I was thinking of texting her a happy birthday or inviting her to grab lunch or coffee to celebrate before her birthday.

1hnwz2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petaluma/comments/1hnwz2k/ranking_the_petaluma_shopping_centers_for_no/,Ranking the Petaluma Shopping Centers (for no reason),"Here is my completely biased, incomplete, and unnecessary ranking of the Petaluma Shopping Centers. 

**10. Petaluma Gateway Center**

This is the big Lakeville Lucky, with lots of parking. Pretty convenient to everyone. And it's across from Goodwill.   
  
It’s fine. Personally, not a ton of draw to this center for me, and it’s been a while since I’ve been there. I always forget about Papa Murphy’s, take-and-bake is still a great concept, and I need to do that more. The Mexican place is fine as I recall. It looks like there is a hobby store there now, so that seems cool!

**9. East Washington Place**

The Target mall. Lotta big boxes here, and not a ton of character. And that’s fine. Target is necessary. Dick’s is necessary (*but go to Big 5 first)*. I hear people love Sprouts.    
  
BevMo: I go to Willibee’s or Griffo or Barber Lee or Henhouse or directly to any of our local wine/booze/beer producers first over BevMo , but I understand people like it, and it’s not a bad store.

Home Goods is probably the craziest store here, it gets wild on some of those shelves. The only place in this mall you can go without an agenda and browse. I got a cheap french-press for camping there once. 

Food wise, it’s all chains?    
  
B-Dub-Dub's is probably the strongest place here. It’s pretty fun to go to an “event” there, even if it’s “wildly” expensive. Most things like that would be watched at McNear’s, but sometimes a big fight can be fun there. Or if you get out of the Petaluma Speedway, and want to walk to the closest bar, this might be it. Or just go the other direction to Mario and John’s. 

**8. The Pub Republic Center**

I’m going to include it, although it barely qualifies as a shopping center. I think it’s all dining, and no retail? But Pub Republic is awesome, and a great place after a hike at Tolay or Shollenberger, so let’s rank it. Haven’t been to the Pickles replacement yet, but hope they’re doing well. 

**7. The Wilco Shopping Center**

I’m  not sure if this place even has a name, but Wilco is the anchor. Wilco does ok for most of what you need, when you don’t need to go to Friedman’s. Plus they have a solid clothing/hat selection. 

Beyond Wilco, there’s a lot of range in this mall. You can get smogged, ship a package, have some Italian or Hawaiian, and grab a pack of smokes.  It’s all over the place. And we all love and need IHOP. 

I don’t get there often, but this center ranks high because of their eclectic curation. It feels like they will take a chance on a lot of stores that might not make it into other centers, like the  vegan joint. It has a renegade feel to it, and I would love for it to go even crazier. 

**6. The McDowell / Casa Grande Center**

Small but mighty, this a great center. You might know it as the Hector’s Pizza place. People go crazy for Hector's. So we will call that the anchor.   
  
Beyond that, there’s more good dining - Belfare, famous for their famer’s market chicken sando, has their storefront there. It’s amazing.  There’s also always good sushi (haven’t been to the new one). Drive-through coffee is a huge plus. The Adobe market is rad, and has a great selection of beer and booze. They had the Deftones collab beer in there for a long time. 

**5. The Kohl’s Shopping Center.** 

I also do not know if this place has a name, so I picked the presumed anchor. 

This center serves its purpose. Kohl’s is rad. It’s a small department store, and small department stores are always cool. I need a tie or pair of nylons TODAY. Good deals on jeans. And then get a blender and some slippers. Why not? Michaels is obviously always needed and appreciated. Dollar Tree is tolerated, Five Below can just go away. 

Dining is a nice little row. Beyond The Glory - obviously an institution. The place with the poke bowls is a unique offering for town. The taqueria is reliable. Sandwich-wise, we have two great options - Bianchini’s are always good, and then you have the incredible Local right across the parking lot. If you’ve never sat by the gym pool, drinking a Henhouse, eating a Della Fattoria-bread sando, watching people exercising…well you’re missing out. 

We could extend this center to include Henhouse, Griffo, Goat Rock, and Lagunitas for drinking and eating, but that would be unfair and take it way over number 1 on the list. But they are there. 

**6. Washington Square**

This is a fine center, with a lot of good elements. It might be a bit big for me, and I get a bit lost in it. But it is full of good, solid stores, and thus ranks high. I think the only reason I don’t get there more is I don’t understand the dining options.   
  
The Safeway is a monster, and has it all, but a bit big for me. But a rock solid anchor. There’s a lot in this center, and I’m just starting to understand it, so I’ll do my personal highlights: The lunch buffet at Round Table is awesome, and they have beer and video games. Obviously, See’s Candy. We all appreciate the office store. Harbor Freight has many strengths, and we are all happy to have it there. It’s also nice to break up Starbucks with a Peets. Oh, and Noah’s! For tuna on a toasted onion bagel, that’s a great sandwich. 

And the Hallmark store is awesome. I actually wind up there way more than I ever would have thought. Lots of Peanuts merch, for our local hero Charles Schulz. The namesake of the always amazing STS airport, but that’s another post. 

**5. Leghorn Marketplace**

Sadly, I got here after G and G, so I didn’t get to experience that. But the Safeway is great -  big, quiet, easy parking. A very solid supermarket.   
  
Beyond that, this small mall packs some surprising punch. Chunky’s is one of the best seated taquerias in town, the chili verde is awesome and the beer is cheap. Acme Burger must think something is happening in this mall, and just opened up a big new spot. And then there’s Starbucks, and pizza too. I think there’s one or two new places slated to open up soon too. Plus some utility - a dry cleaner, nails, eyebrows I think? It’s extremely well-rounded for the size. The two awesome unique factors for Leghorn - An Arthur Murray dance studio. In 2024! How rad is that? And then the basketball court right next to Chunky’s gives the place life. More parks right next to centers, please. 

**4. Town and Country Shopping Center**

Some call it “Old Lucky,” some ""Yucky Lucky.""  It’s a fine store - nothing spectacular, but not yucky. I feel bad for the people who work there, unless they call it yucky Lucky. 

Why so high? Beyond the anchor, there’s strength in this small mall. First off - the one-two punch of the Aquarium next to the Alano. That combo alone shoots this center up 3 or 4 places, because we’ve all been in both rooms. Then you have Rain Dog, a record store that has live bands. How rad is that?! Dining wise, we have great options. Acre with the pinball, and Boulevard. But I think we can also expand the dining to the 4 corners, and then we pick up Brigitte and the new bakery. And hell, wander a little bit down to Oaxaca and Mi Pueblo too. This place just has good vibes, and is a rare west-side center. I didn't include the outlets, they don't count. 

  
**3. Deer Creek Village**

A relative new-comer on the scene, and definitely benefits from a lot of exciting start-up dining options.But what a wild range of options. First off - props to the OG Mary’s, holding it down. And also one of the only full bars on the entire East Side. 

In the last few years, we’ve seen all these restaurants open - Bonchon, Nick The Greek, Cafe Mimosa. Then you have SoDoCo for sandos, and I think a stroopwafel joint is opening next to it soon too? Habit and Jamba are solid (although there’s smoothies downtown again now). Plus a Dunkin if Ben Affleck ever winds up in Petaluma. 

Then the bigs - Obviously Friedman’s. Beyond what it is, there’s the beautiful front wall. Smart and Final is rock solid, decent produce, great pantry staples, moderate bulk goods, but the beer selection is a bit lacking. They do have block ice though. And did you know the name comes from the combined last names of the founders? And then the gym - it has a pool and whirlpool and a basketball court. Love the downtown 24-hour Fitness, and the Mystic-facing treadmills, but these elements help City Sports it out.  

Then there’s a handful of professional services, and tons of room for growth. It’s next to a dog park. Plus some of the best public art in Petaluma sprinkled around the buildings. This is a great center, and has great curation. Expect big things in 2025 with all that open storefront. 

  
**2. The Plaza North Shopping Center**

Range and depth. Nuts and bolts. But also packed with a little fun. Don’t sleep on Plaza North. 

First off, the presumptive anchor. Trader Joe’s. Enough said.   
  
Then you have the complimentary grocery stores Raley’s and Lola’s. Raley’s has the best supermarket concrete floor in town. I recently discovered this combo - Raley’s has really good in-house tortilla chips to serve with the amazing preparada meats at Lola’s. Lola’s also has a taqueria in-house. Between these three stores, your grocery shopping can be completely done quickly and cheaply. 

Dining-wise it’s got it all. We have a top-5 Mexican with Don Pancho’s. There’s Vietnamese, Korean, Sushi, Thai, Chinese, breakfast, cookies, Fruta…Superburger too, but it needs to bring back beer. Sadly, no full bar in the center (afaik) but really, some of the best mid-priced places in town. And the fast food too, if everything else is closed. Oh, and Starbucks if you must (but try Eggspresso first). You can eat well in Plaza North. 

Retail and everything else is just fun. Always try Big 5 before Dick’s. You can find some deals, and unique items. There’s utility with Ross. We have the used CD rack at Goodwill.  There’s pilates, they even set up in the parking lot during pandemic. The last (?) BofA lobby in town. Petco. And KIM is giving haircuts  in Plaza North, and don’t say you never tried the $5 haircut. Plus there’s a gas station (with car wash) when you’re ready to leave. 

Obviously, there’s a huge hole in the Kmart space. If the right tenant came in, it could take this center over the top. Home Depot was proposed but we don’t need it (we have Friedman’s). Indoor pickleball/bocci with food and drink? And karaoke rooms? Some other sort of “destination based entertainment?” The perimeter buildings themselves are holding up (and Raley’s looks great), but the satellite buildings and parking lots could use a little love. Plus maybe some exciting public art and landscaping. With a few cosmetic tweaks and a new anchor, the sky is the limit at Plaza North.   
  
**1.** **River Plaza (Golden Eagle Shopping Center)**

There’s a cliche about “location, location, location,” and that is certainly true here. But this center has gone beyond being just the (formerly) secret downtown parking lot, and uses their relatively small footprint widely and diversely. 

Dining is a standout, with something for everyone: all-you-can-eat sushi at Paradise, Everest, ice cream, boba, even Domino’s (which is probably the best deal for delivery in town). And also donuts. Plus fine dining at Luma and the river views.   


And then Taps. I loved the bar in the basement (now courtyard) of the Hotel, but I really love the deck on the river. If you’ve ever paddled up from the Sheraton to Taps for a beer and burger, you know what I’m talking about. 

Retail is full of utility - We all go to Grocery Outlet, and their wine is the secret. Plus they sponsor almost every event in town - think of a street fair or festival where you haven’t seen their booth and banner. We all need the Dollar Tree, so sure. The bike store is great. Plus all the other random necessary stores - optometrist, I think a phone store? Plus we just got the new docks for the turning basin, and the float house coming back over across the river. It’s part of the heart of downtown, and therefore the easy winner. ",6,1735357183.0,Petaluma,5,1.0,False

i reminded her of my ongoing financial situation and suggested we do something cheaper, to which she suggested just the fancy brunch ($100) and a perfume making class ($80). this doesn't factor costs like gas/parking (restaurants and events are 1 hour away and in a major city) and coffee, snacks or other purchases between these activities as we would be hanging out all day. unfortunately this would still cost way more than i'd like to spend. 

i'd prefer to reschedule for when i get paid, or just do something else entirely. i'm sure she will offer to pay my way, but im not sure how i feel about that. i'd love to avoid spending a lot of money on her birthday at all. this friend lives at home with her parents, whereas i live on my own and pay my own bills.

do i ask her to do a cheaper celebration? ask her to postpone? i really have no budget for this. it's hard because i'm the only one set to attend

, so, 
because we can write the word „god„ in the earth, in mud, in sand, in snow, in trees, on paper, in books, on keyboards, in texts, with chisels and hammers in all sorts of metals and stones, we have proven that the literary formation of semiotic notation first conceived from a cerebrospinal tissue behaviour moving the spinal cord via electrochemical behaviours until spinal cord vibrations become biochemically communicated via data travelling through the nervous system with sufficient energy that the brain stem and limbic system and neocortex all correctly interpret the vibrational frequencies and receive the message effectively and efficiently enough that the unconscious mind biochemically entrenches that data as an information packet in a cerebral network of neurons and stem cells from their humble origins as down and up quarks forming fundamentally essential neurons and their fundamentally essential friends protons, as well as the various bosons, fermions, and hadrons that constitute base components of particle physics, travel through cyberspacetime unless we scientifically confirm cyberspace and spacetime are separate entities and not collectively a singularity presenting itself as a duality, then we have an axiomatic basis conducting electromagnetic fields waves and gravitational fields and waves in a symbiotic concordance that was initially conceived in the unconscious, then the subconscious, then present conscious awareness of thought, as per ctmu, simulation theory, and theory of mind as conjunctively differentiated parentheses, elements of biochemistry becoming psychological phenomena becoming sociological phenomenology becoming language barriers becoming linguistic concepts becoming logical continuity becoming mathematical equations and expressions validated via their principles, properties, qualities, and the quantum quantities they all carry and hold and share and take, 
we can correctly differentiate the biochemicals responsible in spreading 
«, the word of god, as the word, ‘god’, », 
as biological cultures speaking with us in a way we comprehend as body language becoming presence of mind as the primarily internalised neural body language of action potentials and their various functions and reciprocals of hormonal and neurotransmitter based relationships becomes increasingly externalised via gestures, posture, vocalisation, and written communication as a mathematician comprehending they are operationally the math and the mathematician, in the same way the musician comprehends sound engineering in basic terms axiomatically necessitates fidelity and volume as the music departs from the musician and enters the greater body of music theory that is itself a branch of mathematics, 
we are the math and music of anything, everything, nothing, and something vibrationally comprehending the collectively developed and mutually comprehensible technical term «, god, » as an axiomatic representation of greater and or higher power as per the hierarchical systemisation of power classification known as «, taxonomy, », because even many of the staunchest atheistic minds include terms such as «, god, heaven, hell, jesus, », and other theological nomenclature in their respective vernacular, 
so, 
god is real because the word “god” is real and because the word is real that means we must have thought it up ourselves, so either we are god, we can conceive god, we perceive god, or we are in the operational process of bringing god to(2) life via living vicariously as lucidly as family and friends celebrating accomplishments and commiserating with ourselves in the universal commissary intuitively comprehensible of deontological etymology, 
deontological hierarchy places «, god, » above all, and thus the taxonomic system dynamics function in accordance with that centralising theme of power, 
if a digital algorithm can recognise we perceive specific entities as representing «, god, » in the most axiomatically correct application of scientifically systematic mathematical syntax, which is contingently correct because that’s what computer science does, then the coders, aka writers, aka linguists, aka mathematicians, aka scientists, aka humans, aka the collective consciousness we presently know as the source of the internet, are as much god as we are parts of god as we are searching the universe in hope of, aka in prayer of, finding god, 
because humans seek power, and have done since the dawn of cyberspace and spacetime, as well as every perceivably conceivable iteration of notation, whether that’s chemical notation, chess notation, linguistics, logic, mathematics, physics, psychology, sociology, or another scientific branch of universal study, 
science itself is the study of power, 
scientists study the power they find most appealing and within their aptitude, some prefer archaeology and biology and chemistry and ecology and the obvious tangibles, some prefer more abstract concepts of those physical phenomena and study astronomy and computer science and psychology and socioeconomics, the point is all of these concepts are studies of power and its effects, so does math, so does physics, so does every quantum iteration of cats and dogs and horses and humans as well as big cats and wolves and buffalo and primates, 
we study power because power makes us feel safe, secure, sound of mind, stable, and above all, because we recognise power as a fundamental principle of existence, 
ergo, god is powers representation, 
a posteriori, god is a linguistic representation of power, 
ipso jure, god is a logical constant in the pursuit of power, 
a priori, god is a unit of power, 
ipso facto, god is the most powerfully powerful stuff conceivably imaginable in our species known range of perception, 
which means, 
if you recognise the word «, god, » as a word, 
you recognise god is a real word, 
ergo, 
a god is real stuff, 
a god is a real thing, 
a god is axiomatically real, 
a god is hypothetically real, 
so, 
a god is propositionally real, 
ergo, 
a god is theoretically real, 
ergo, 
a god is real, 
a posteriori becomes ipso jure because syllogistic continuity dictates it contingently, 
thus we have our a priori becoming ipso facto as it dawns upon us that, 
we are as much a god itself as we are anything and everything a god can do because anything and everything a god can do through us, can be done through us, has been done through us, or will be done through us,

5. It reminded me how incredibly over indulgent America's food culture is, though I see a great deal awareness raising, and of course I look for these groups so maybe it's tough to see the larger picture, not sure how wide spread the awareness is growing. 


6. Feelings of regret about not practicing this sooner quickly passed as I felt so much here and now that it didn't matter as I was doing what's best presently, which is all we ever have. 


7.  I'm about 9kg over fat at the start but lost 3kg in three days as I kept up my cardio each day, wind cycling 10 minutes twice a day each day and did slow but physical labor to boot. 


8. I ate ""clean"" tonight, and enjoyed it in a sensual way.  I'll eat breakfast tomorrow and then start another 3 days to make it into the new year.

I’m Nervous, but excited. We’re getting brunch, and my plan is if it goes well to ask her to go to IKEA with me, I need to go there anyways and it’s right by where we are going to eat.

I’m not quite sure where I’m going with this, but this woman just seems really cool, plus she has the most stunning eyes😅

It’s pretty casual, we really are just seeing who the other person is I guess. We both want a long-term partner and want to take our time.

I don’t want to come in too strong, I can be intense, but I’m a pretty caring person I like to think, I felt like she was pretty into spending time together. We had coffee and went for a walk in the freezing cold haha.

Any advice for a second date?",23,1735356611.0,Healthygamergg,10,0.96,False

There were a handful of options and the barista happily explained each option. They talked about the process they have for choosing coffees and dialing the in before putting them on the menu. Such a treat!

1hnwoap,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnarkyRecapsBySwiss/comments/1hnwoap/cinderjana_and_the_5_dancing_bridesmaids_part_1/,CinderJana and the 5 Dancing Bridesmaids Part 1 | Wedding Week!,"Welcome back Snarkers, since CinderJana is dragging out every single thing about her long-awaited wedding, I decided to make this a 3-parter. This is of course based on her making her vlogs about the wedding stretch all the way to her first wedding anniversary or pregnancy announcement, whichever comes first. Let’s jump on into Wedding Week!

CinderJana’s new dress is scandalously cut off the shoulder. I know we theorize that Meech is on sedatives since The Sentence was passed down, but have we considered that Rimmy J may have lost his religion and been prescribed something to help him cope with the shame and destruction his firstborn wrought on his empire? Whether Rimmy J is dissociated, medicated or just let her have her way, she picks one of the most contemporary dresses we’ve ever seen these people pick. After a spate of newly minted Mrs. Duggars, we are finally getting back to a Duggar bride. The caption says Wedding Countdown: as a Live Laugh Love-y font swings and reads 10 days. She’s obviously at her final fitting and is adjusting her neckline in the mirror. The voiceover says that she was not exactly happy with the neckline. Well, [I prepared for this months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/1etvxfc/my_wedding_present_to_jana_from_the_deepest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) She “knew” she was walking a fine line between Holy and Harlot but never fear, her fairy wedding dress salesperson is here with modesty panels. Or maybe CinderJana brought them herself. She’s going to go to another bridal shop to check out a back up option. At least Countess Gagula would have tried the thrift store before another boutique.

The wind noise is significant as CinderJana stands on a sunny sidewalk next to a jumpscare level J’Blessa. Mr. Swiss says “that’s a lot of teeth” since J’Blessa has her face scrunched up and her upper teeth bared. I can only imagine what her face would look like if they were facing the sun. CinderJana slides the camera over showing more of her coffee-lensed J’aviators and a J18 with eyes tightly shut against the sun, that is in her face due to her standing against the building. Back to J’Blessa, still with her best linebacker intimidation growl on her face, and she nods her approval to the backup more modest dress. She also closes her mouth. J18 falls into line with CInderJana and J’Blessa. They enter the shop and J’Blessa helps adjust an option on CinderJana, before the cut flips to a different dress. She walks up to the mirror in a modester neckline and sleeves with puffs as big as a Duggalos head. She found two more dresses and the second one was an open lace pattern as close to skin tight as any of them have gotten. She hopes to not need it but she has a plan B. \*buzzes Jeopardy buzzer\* What is something a Fundie has never said?

Now, we come across a “final hometown tradition”, as Kath! and J’Annoying Orange clap next to a roach coach at a fair, named the Tontitown Grape Festival. I…have a question. Do the grapes make the alcohol-free wine from the Bible like Pa “Whoville Extra #5” Keller says exists? The scene shifts from the stage and band to Kath! handing J’Annoying Orange a large soft-serve cone of grape ice cream. A USF, Unidentified Smiling Fundie, appears and offers a cone to CinderJana. She flips the camera after a bite of the ice cream and walks towards the other J’Locusts that came with her to the fair. She zooms in on the cone a couple times, says “oh yeah” and then starts to film others behind her. Jed! and Kath! with J’Orchestra Pit, OfJ’Orchestra Pit and J’Annoying Orange all eat the ice cream and for some reason CinderJana thinks we want to see this.  Next, she wanders up behind girls in shorts she hasn’t bothered to edit as the captions explain grape stomping is a tradition as Kath! and other mothers hold their children up and let them stomp. Ra!, bafflingly dressed in pastels, stomps grapes as Kath! holds her up. Ra! herself is baffled by the grapes and seems unimpressed as she is lifted out and to the side as her aunts and uncles cheer. I’m thinking the USF is Kath!s ~~future nanny~~ sister that lives nearby as she takes Ra! from Kath! Bubbles fly through a quick lingering shot of Kath! and OfJ’Orchestra Pit’s midsections. I hope one of the Wiss-ters-In-Love do the same to her. Ra! and Tru! run after bubbles that Jed! blows. Thank God he’s using that hot air for something besides airing out his asinine opinons. CinderJana films Jed! and Tru! in a small fair ride that Tru! doesn’t appear to like.

A Wiss-tful CinderJana begins to pack after announcing “the day is here”. We are 9 days out and she shows off the packing bags she ordered off of Amazon. She’s starting to compile all her things and spins around the bedroom. She shows us where she’s almost unpacked from her bachelorette trip, where she’s trying to pack for the honeymoon and where she’s trying to pack to move. She tearfully packs up her tiny house and gestures to the furniture she’s leaving. I mean, does she just need a big ol hope chest or something for her clothes and a couple suitcases? She shows off the corner with the wedding stuff, the corner with the Nebraska bound stuff like we need to store this information in our brains. Oh, and her plants are going with her because she’s afraid to leave them to die. What, is the she-shed going to sit gathering dust until the next Designated Stay At Home Daughter gets engaged and needs content? Finally, she’s taking Alfred, her stuffed abominable snowman, or some form of primate. J19 (I assume) films as CinderJana pulls out 6 pairs of white tennis shoes, 4 beige pairs of various style of dress shoe, black pumps and flats, and a pair each of loafers, slippers and slides going from tan to beige to white. Plus what I assume are her white fuzzy honeymoon slippers.  The caption says “Insane amount of shoes”. I can’t get over the 6 pairs of Sporty Mom 500s. As CinderJana sits up she reveals a handful of sandals. A black pair of dress flats is tossed over as she sorts them out and the captions say she was telling herself to never buy shoes again. Is she going to gave a silent auction of the shoes she’s not taking or is she taking all of them? She stands and surveys as J19 films and comments on how much stuff there is. The captions say that you never realize how much stuff you have until you move. She hasn’t helped enough siblings move in or out of a house to realize that yet? CinderJana begins to mutter to the camera about keeping black pumps, beige pumps, and another with a chunky heel. They were cheapies and CinderJana, embracing the Duggar pinchpenny gene, mumbles on about how she could scrub them up and other pros to keeping them and keeps them. Slowly all the rest of the beige heels and dress shoes make it to the keep pile. After musing that she wore both pairs of black flats aka “granny shoes” enough to keep them she hands a pair of white tennis shoes to J18. The caption says something about sisters sharing things followed by a heart because Perm has left an indelible mark on her daughters. Oh, and apparently J19 was just hanging out at the beginning of this scene.

8 days left until CinderJana marries her preachy Prince Preaching and her eyeliner stands out like Sharpie marker lines in a sea of cream and beige as she frantically tries to pack up a half a square foot closet. Maybe if she quit trying to film everything she did she would probably be able to get things done. So far though, she has packed half of her closet by cutting holes in the bottom seam of a garbage bag to make a garment bag with the hangers taped together. I want to know how long it took her to figure that one out. She spins around the house as her coffee nerves wear off and the scene changes to her bridesmaids in the nail salon. OfPlanes and J17 are to CinderJana’s left while J’Blessa and J18 (holding Pastor GAS) are on her right. CinderJana explains that only some of the Duggalettes could make it today so there’s another nail salon party later. I’m so exhausted by this fact. Like who has time to have two separate nail salon outings?

The countdown skips 7 and goes directly to 6 days in the TTH industrial size kitchen that I’ll admit I’ve always been a little jealous of, and pissed off they use it to make such blatantly beige food crimes. They’re prepping cheesecakes and I can’t snark on them. Cheesecakes rule. The next shot is of a very Lost Boy looking Prince Preaching, opening a wedding present in the main room of TTH. It’s one of those Slap-Chop boxes and he proceeds to list everything they can do like Wish is running a late night informercial and he’s the talent. CinderJana tosses up the caption that he is giving a sales pitch to the audience. I mean, if this preacher gig fails, he can always be an MLM RV sales man. CinderJana drives the RV and parents while he tries to grift. As he lists off the different slices, dices and cuts, CinderJana reminds her Prince Preaching that he is the one who will be cooking. Her caption states that he is better at it than she is and I just think she hated that jurisdiction and passed it off all these years. Like mother, like daughter. She sends out a mass thank you card by saying “so grateful for every gift” with a heart at the end. I refer you to my previous statement about mothers and daughters.

 OfJernie has her Wiss-ter hat on and is teaching her big bro how to make her new double Wiss-ter-In-Law a latte despite his not being a coffee drinker. Another heart at the end of this caption too. I didn’t have “CinderJana makes a drinking game out of the white heart emoji” on my recap bingo card this year. The caption pops up that we have 4 days left. I think they’re in The Jernie’s Honeymoon camper because this coffee nook looks familiar. Disregard my previous statement, I see a regular door. You know, I haven’t the foggiest where in the hell they are because this looks like a pop out and there’s no way the Jernie’s have 2 and a half Bunk Baby B-Squad members in that camper. Jesus, that sounds like a nightmare.

3 days to go and Austina has her fancy self in the pedicure chair as OfNostrils looks on next to her. CinderJana walks up to her niece, well trained in being on camera, to ooh and aah over the child’s favorite Harlot Red sparkly mani- Cotton Candy pink sparkly pedi. The child likes the bold colors and I respect her confidence after her beige baby and toddlerhoods. An old hand, she nods yes that she likes the water on her feet as the massage chair massages the back of her head. CinderJana is filmed getting her nails done as OfNostrils chatters on and Austina calmly blows her fingernails dry with her hands resting on a pillow. The caption reads “blowing on her nails to help them dry faster” followed by another damn heart. The camera shot transitions to J16 getting a manicure, then J18 as music takes over and OfNostrils waves from the pedicure chair to the camera. CinderJana is trying almond shaped nails and girl. Never “try” any new services right before your wedding. She focuses in on a sample nail of a Barbie-esque character and asks if she should get it while giving the heart emoji a break and subbing in a laughing one. The nail tech paints a white tip on her pink nails and honestly? There’s nothing like a good pink and white or a French tip. If she’s going to experiment with shape, at least she’s not experimenting with the color. Less risky but maybe she actually has a rush over the wedding dress not being ready? J18 has some basic squ-ovals and yeah, they’re my jam too. Can’t hate on the classics. CinderJana however does express some trepidation at experimenting with the almond nails, leaving the laughing emoji up again. The next shot is of her changing her mind and getting them changed. OfNostrils calmly and matter-of-factly says that she’s paying and if CinderJana doesn’t love her nails then they’re getting them redone. OfNostrils says they have short and stubby fingers and can’t pull it off. I have pianist hands and I couldn’t pull an almond nail off. Squ-ovals for life!

We come to a nighttime shot of CinderJana and Prince Preaching practicing their dance on a tennis court as the videographers squabble amongst themselves as to whether they should leave them alone or not with one saying it’s a special moment. The irony is underscored as 2 small blond children ride around the dancing couple on a tandem trike. “So pure” says a Lost Girl. Child, I have footage of your infancy that would blow your mind. From national syndicated cable, no less. The scene quickly turns to J’Annoying Orange grabbing attention.

2 days to go and what in God’s green dick is the other half of this vlog? Oh. The Rehearsal. They realize they are boring, right? There’s no drama with the rehearsal like I’m sure TLC sabotaged The $eeWorld reception’s ice cream. Or was it the Count and Countess Gagula’s floats? I don’t remember, and that was before my YouTube jurisdiction.  A Wiss-ter stands before a huge amount of round cup-like paper contraptions dropping what looks like fudge or chocolate sauce on them. As Cinderjana approaches, the Wiss-ter tells her there are a couple out in the other room if she wants to try one. Cinderjana swans out of the kitchen to see J’Lost In The Airport standing by the sink while a couple of USFs stir chocolate on the stove. Masses of long-stem flowers wait on the counter. J’Lost In The Airport is filling up a bucket and the scene shifts to a shot of Prince Preaching chopping the foliage and dropping it stem down into the bucket full of water. Now CinderJana films herself sitting shotgun as Prince Preaching comes out to drive her to get medical attention for her toe. She’s stubbed it a lot and she thinks it might need the toenail removed. The final injury happened while practicing their dance. She shows her second toe on her right foot wrapped on a napkin. We arrive and immediately jump to Prince Preaching sitting in the chair of an exam room while the caption gives the first content warning a Duggar Vlog ever had. Her big toenail, freshly pedicured white, is almost 3/4 ripped off. Prince Preaching is about to be Prince Passing Out. J’Bless’im though, he’s going to try to support her through it. He does manage to come up with this nugget of wisdom, however when he says “in a year, you’ll have a whole new one.” I wonder if she will get a discount on her pedicures until it grows back? The almost-weds bicker a bit over that’s actually what the doctor said or if she’s going to be going by the street name of Janny Nine Nails once she gets to Nebraska. The scene shifts to black and white as she goes old school TLC and films her medical procedure. The Sin City theme shows a fully exposed nailbed as the caption states she never thought she wouldn’t have a toenail at her wedding. The entire Swiss household isn’t sure how this wasn’t fucking reported. That thing pops off like it’s a Chiclet.

As a palate cleanser, the wedding cakes appear in the industrial sized fridge as the caption places a green check mark. The shot shows a now stoic Prince Preaching mopping the front entrance. One of the plethora of toddlers has had the runs and he is gamely mopping up. After watching his fiancée film herself getting 20% of her pedicure popped off, this is probably nothing. She says it’s his initiation and well, when you’ve got a revolving door daycare of cousins there’s a huge mess a lot of the time. Prince Preaching gives the slide a practical once over with the mop too. She must have gotten some good drugs because she asks him to crawl up in the slide. He says he won’t fit, she says he will. She’s lucky he doesn’t just pour Fabuloso from the top of the slide and call it a day after she proved she’s the most J’angster Duggalette in his presence.

1 day out. It’s rehearsal day, everyone. Janny Nine Nails is going to have a headship at last. But first, she needs to pick up the risky risque wedding dress. OfPlanes has a friend who will “personally” fix it. Perm finally shows up throughout this final week but sits on her phone as OfPlanes sits at the kitchen table with a USF. The almost-weds are riding in an elevator that is under construction with their newly issued marriage license. They get into the car with a Dillard’s bag behind Prince Preaching in the driver’s seat. CinderJana shows off the stuff they’re taking to the venue for the rehearsal, and fills us in on the fact that some family will be late due to travel and…okay? These aren’t high stakes. They near the venue and they both get more excited. Turning in at a sign that says The Grand at Willow Springs, they marvel that the pond and fountain feature was finished before their ceremony and reception. She shows off the building as they approach and the filming changes hands as the rehearsal dinner takes place. CInderJana and Prince Preaching stand with The Tontitown Gruesome Twosome and the Wissmans in the front of the room. Then they all sing. And we end up back at J’Planes house because OfPlane’s friend finished the dress. Jingle has a polaroid, J’Blessa lounges on the floor, as ofPlanes and Planes watch from a couch.  CinderJana comes out in what looks like the original dress. The exclamations abound as everyone praises a dress that covers up maybe half an inch? It looks the exact same as she was bitching about. Oh, and homegirl also added a bustle. A bustle that needs specific lessons. But that’s after CinderJana went and bought a long veil option to try on. J’Planes just sits behind his sister watching on awkwardly as his other sister gets lessons on how to bunch the skirt up.

We finally arrive at CinderJana’s wedding day. She says it’s so crazy and hard to believe. No, this is what’s crazy and hard to believe. Prince Preaching slept in the other half of the she-shed. He starts singing “going to the chapel”. Seriously, is Rimmy J fucking sedated? They sleepily start to get ready to go. A minivan is filmed with Jingle getting out at the venue as J’Blessa hands out small Target bags while squinting again into the sunlight. Jingle rushes over past Pastor Gas’ Doona and shows off mini Listerine and Orbit gum. “It’s perfect!” exclaims CInderJana as the scene enters the get ready room. J19 has curls in her hair, J18 has under eye masks, J’Lost In The Airport is… J’Lost In The Girls Room? He seems to just be standing by the window. Three people begin to clear away food as people mill about the room. A still of Jingle, OfPlanes, Carlin and OfNostrils on a couch, as the reception bird’s eye view shows a giant X made up of long tables with smaller round tables interspersed. Turning around from this view we see the ~~12~~ 5 Dancing ~~Princesses~~ Bridesmaids in taupe silk in a cream and blondewood furnished room. The snacks from earlier appear as she teases the next installment of her wedding vlogs. The final shot is of a restored 50s car parked in front of the venue.

there’s a knock at the door. you run to hide your cat so he doesn’t escape. 

you turn the lock & open the door. it’s the sister missionaries. you stare at them in stunned silence, mostly because why in the world would they walk up the dingy stairs to your apartment when there’s the main house attached to your place. 

they’re asking if someone lives there but it’s not you (thankfully). you know the name & it’s someone who has moved from the main house & is long gone. you tell them that. 

but they keep talking. they ask you if you know about the church, oh i know about the church. but you don’t say that, you say you’ve already been baptized but you work. (this is where i went wrong). they jarringly ask you how Jesus helps you in your daily life. you mutter off something about anxiety & school & they seem to grab at the thin string you’ve thrown their way. one of them scrambles for a scripture about how Jesus helps those afflicted & asks you to read it. 

they’re standing in your stairwell. it’s freezing cold. there’s a trash bag to your left & it smells, mixing with the smell of coffee wafting from the pot. you feel yourself slowly slipping into a anxious dissociative state as you grab the BOM she hands you & you’re shaking so much you drop her LDS pamphlets that were shoved in her book. you read through the verse, wondering why you’re even reading it when you were the one who said the stuff about Jesus helping with anxiety. Asking you to the scripture as if you need convincing.. Jeez. 

you’re trying to be as kind as possible because you have pity for missionaries but you feel yourself getting more & more anxious, & more & more sweaty. they ask you about your records & you stammer about “yes please move them” (😭😭😭). they ask about any other roommates they should come. back. for. but God knows you live with you’re boyfriend they will never ever know that. you take their little paper & close the door.

I asked her out when we first met, and she said she had a boyfriend. I said okay. But then she asked to hangout with me the next day. We hungout all day for 4 days straight until she left the city. Since then, she hasn't stopped texting me. The things she says to me at times make me think that there's no possible way that I'm misreading that she definitely likes me. But then a few times, she's brought up her boyfriend or called me a friend. English isn't her first language, so I'm not sure how to read that. 

After she brought up her boyfriend once, I just left her on read, because I don't want to get strung along. 24 hours, she texts me again, and just keeps going. She tells me deep stuff too. It's not coffee banter; it's like very substantive conversation. She says she wants to visit me all the time. She said the other day that she wants to take me somewhere. I was talking about my gay friend at one point and joked that I wasn't gay, and she literally said ""good, because that would mean that liking me doesn't mean anything"". And there are plenty of other things like that she's said.

For context, she said she's been dating her boyfriend for 4 months when we first met like 3 weeks ago. She's mentioned him like 3 times max, and it was a glancing mention.

José Augusto do Amaral, known as ""Preto do Amaral, is considered the first serial killer in the history of Brazil (and probably one of the first in Latin America).

He was born in Conquista, in the state of Minas Gerais, in 1871. We do not know the identity of his parents, what little we know about them and that they were both slaves, in a period of Brazilian history when slavery had not yet existed. been abolished

The ""Lei Aurea"", also known as Imperial Law 3,353, was signed by Princess Isabel on May 13, 1888 and symbolizes the end of slavery in Brazil. The law freed between 700,000 and 1 million slaves, making them citizens of Brazil. José Augusto now saw himself as a free man, but he did not have many job options, mainly because of the racism that was still present in society, but also because of his poor education and cognitive development.

Without many job options, he ended up enlisting in the army. and served in several Brazilian cities, and even participated in the War of Canudos. He deserted several times from battalions he served in, whether in the army or in the police guard and, finally, he ended up arrested, spending months in jail.

After traveling around Brazil as a volunteer for his country, at the age of 55 Arnaral was living on side jobs in São Paulo. At this time, between 1926 and 1927, José began to commit his murders.

In 1926, when he was already 55 years old and had a wanderer's life and lived on side jobs, he committed his first alleged crime. Antonio Sanches, the first victim, was already 27 years old. In his statement, Amaral states that he found him on the outskirts of Tiradentes square and that the victim asked him for matches. After having coffee in a café, Amaral invited the boy to watch a football game. The body was found near ""Campo de Marte"" airport, in the north zone.

when he died, on Christmas Eve 1926. Amaral attracted the boy by giving him some of the balloons he sold in the Canindé region. José was found 13 days after his death, already without his upper limbs.

Antônio Lemos, was 15 years old when his body was located, the São Paulo police realized that they were dealing with the same killer

Amaral was only captured thanks to Roque Piccili, a 9-year-old shoeshine boy. He took the boy under a bridge and was strangling the poor guy when he heard voices, got scared and ran away. When he returned, he did not find the almost victim, who at that time was already at the nearest police station reporting his almost murderer. Soon after that he was arrested, tortured by the police and ended up confessing to his alleged crimes. He was already famous in São Paulo even before his arrest, as the newspapers at the time reported about a serial killer in the city and he already had the nicknames in the local media of ""The Black Monster"" and ""The Black Devil"".

Some cases continued to happen, even with Preto Amaral arrested. As a result, he ended up becoming an urban legend, like Bloody Mary. Preto Amaral died of tuberculosis even before being tried, five months after being arrested, in 1927.",10,1735354046.0,serialkillers,6,0.78,False

I think part of the difficulty for me is not only the physical addiction but the fact that smoking is so deeply embedded in so many of my routines. I started at 17, so these routines have been present my whole adult life. The main times I feel I rely on smoking are:

- on a work break - if I don’t have a cigarette, it feels like I’m just aimlessly sitting in a different room for 10 minutes and not really having a break
- when driving - maybe because I get bored?
- transitions - when I need to transition into a new task or activity, going outside for a cigarette lets me get from A to B and gives me a moment to mentally prepare for what I’m going to do next
- after breakfast - once I’ve eaten, and I have a coffee, a cigarette just feels necessary to signal the end of my morning and start of the day.
- Any time I have a coffee or an alcoholic drink, I need to pair it with a cigarette. 

These are the areas where I feel I need to replace smoking with something else. I just don’t know what can give me the same feeling of satisfying the routine, dopamine, etc, with no effort/planning/executive functioning required. Any ideas would be much appreciated.

Our trip was in Early December and was probably the most amazing trip we have ever been on. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I found so many helpful tips and info on Reddit before my trip to Costa Rica, I felt I had to share my experience here in hopes someone may benefit. This is my first Reddit post so bare with me.

PRE TRIP

Our phone service providers (Verizon and T Mobile) offer international data/text/call packages you can buy. We just bought those packages and had no issues with cell service. We still downloaded the areas we needed on google maps offline, so that we could use it in case our service cut out. We had no issues.

It was hard to determine what to pack, it rains off and on each day, but it’s also very humid and warm (near the equator). You want something that will keep you dry, but not something that will keep you hot. We ended up just bringing lightweight water resistant coats (which still totally soaked thru one day when it was pouring raining), pants for the hiking trails (to prevent bug bites, which we never seen bugs, likely due to all the rain), and then gym shorts and tank tops/t shirts (which I was the most comfortable in, even during the light rains). Make sure to bring your swim trunks/bathing suits! For shoes just hiking boots, tennis shoes, and flip flops.

The weather while we were there was unpredictable. The weather app each night would say that it is going to rain all day/all week. But then in reality it would rain a little in the morning, and a little at night, and was beautiful thru the day, or it was a pleasant/very light sprinkle thru the day. There was 1 day we got poured on, but we still had fun with it. When we asked some locals, they told us the weather is totally unpredictable. Good luck.

RENTAL CAR / DRIVING

We arrived at the SJO airport early at 6 AM,  the airport was small and easy to navigate. We decided to rent a car, because it was not very expensive (compared to paying for private drivers each time you need one), and it allowed us WAY more freedom to be able to go out and about and do activities whenever/wherever we wanted. We rented a car from a company called “Vamos”, which was excellent. They picked us up from the airport and shuttled us across the street to their rental car office. They charge a $2000 deposit that gets refunded when you return the car. 

We rented a small car that did have 4x4, however we never needed to use the 4x4. I sure felt reassured having it just in case though! It was a little car and struggled on some of the steep inclines, but nothing we couldn’t manage. 

There was about a 3 or 4 hour drive from San Jose to La Fortuna area. Then was about a 5 or 6 hour drive from La Fortuna to Manuel Antonio. Then about another 5 hours back to SJO airport from Manuel Antonio (through the middle of the night) So, I had my fair share of time behind the wheel. Here are the main takeaways.

- All of the traffic signs are in Spanish (obviously), but I consider myself to be a good driver and I was able to adapt just fine. 

- I was warned about police pulling you over if you speed at all. Initially we did the speed limit/kept with the pace of traffic around us, which felt very slow. However there were a bunch of times where other people were speeding and/or passing right by us. Also there were many times where we would get stuck behind a motorcycle or a big truck that was going waaay too slow. We just got around them whenever it was safe. As I got more comfortable I kind of made my own speed limit based on what seemed normal from the other drivers I seen on the road. We never seen any police cars or had any issues.

- The roads are narrow and very curvy in some parts. Nothing completely outrageous, but not as big as what I was used to in the US. My girlfriend gets car sick but with some Dramamine she was fine. The roads were all paved just fine, occasionally there were roads that were in less than ideal shape, or full on dirt roads. Usually these were short lengths or totally avoidable. We stuck to paved roads 95% of the time.

- The potholes pop up on you quickly and out of nowhere. And also it rains often, so it will look like a small puddle, but actually will be a big pothole. Avoid these. Also definitely be cautious when it rains because some lanes on the road can become mostly or completely flooded, which you will have to briefly cross over into the opposing traffic lane to get around. We did see evidence of previous landslides that had been cleaned up off the road. At one point we there was a traffic stop because of construction crew cleaning up a landslide on the freeway which (fortunately) held us up only about 15 min until they let our lane move on. 

- On the freeway you will see traffic signs that say “Ceda” which means yeild. This is a sign to merge lanes. It is a very abrupt merge, so be ready. Also there will be times where you have to cross over bridges that are only wide enough for 1 car. You have to wait your turn and allow the opposing traffic to pass, then you go. Kind of a “whoever got here first” type of situation. Use caution.

-  We used google maps the whole time and never had any issues with it. We downloaded the google maps offline to our phone so that we could use it without service or WiFi  if we needed to. There was only one time where google maps tried to take us up onto a weird rocky treacherous dirt road, which just looking at it there was no way we were going to last on. I just took a different route and there was no time difference in our ETA. 

- We ran over a nail and got a flat tire one of the days in La fortuna. We discovered the flat in the morning when we were ready to head out for the day. We changed the tire to the spare that was in the trunk, and were told to go down to the gas station and they will fix the tire. The first gas station we stopped at said they couldn’t help us, but sent us to another gas station where they did fix the tire. Costed about $5 USD. Less people really spoke English as we got to the outskirts of town, but still everyone was very helpful.

- Driving at night was not as scary as I had read online. There were definitely stretches of road that was very dark, but you throw your brights on and just be careful. Also there always seemed to be other cars on the road around us, even on our drive from midnight to 5 am from Manuel Antonio to SJO. 

- There were a handful of toll roads along the way on our travels. It had to be like 2 or 3 bucks USD to get thru. We used cash at some and card at others. 

ITINERARY 

The La Fortuna was our first stop. The area is not very big, but there is so so so much to see and do, which is amazing, because you can pack so much into each day without worrying too much about travel times.

Day 1 - breakfast and coffee at Red Frog coffee roasters, explore the little town area, settle into and get set up in Airbnb, and Baldi Hot springs, which was just the first hot springs we found (was awesome, until we found The Springs). Got some bomb quesobirria tacos at “Mexicah Taqueria”. Just relaxed today because we were tired from the flight and the drive. 

Day 2 - coffee at a random coffee shop (there’s so many), Zip lining and ATV tours at “Go Adventure Arenal Park” (this was the day where we got totally rained on, we kept a good attitude, to be honest it added to the experience), lunch at “Soda el Arenal” (these people that own this place are so nice!!!!!) then we got a 2 day pass at “The Springs” to enjoy the hot springs (this place was next level amazing, better than Baldi IMO), massage at Arenal Natural Spa, which is the best massage we ever had.

Day 3 - Mistico hanging bridges, which is kind of like a big nature reserve with paved walkways and like 10 bridges, was pretty cool. It was raining on us pretty hard while we were here as well, but we got some plastic ponchos and were fine. We decided not to do any more hikes because of the rain, and felt like the Mistico bridges park gave us what we wanted for hiking. We stopped for food on the way there and on the way back at random Sodas. Then we chilled at The Springs for the rest of the day, which was amazing being in the hot springs with the light rain. 

Day 4 - breakfast and coffee, Travel to Manuel Antonio (but we stayed in Quepos, which is a 10/15 min drive to Manuel Antonio). Stopped in Jaco for food at “El Chicano Mexican Food” and walked on the beach for just a little bit to stretch the legs. Finished the rest of the drive and settled into our Airbnb in Quepos. Explored the Quepos town area, then got back to our place for some sleep.

Day 5 - Manuel Antonio National park. You have to make a reservation in advance online. You are not allowed to bring food/water into the park (unless in a non disposable water bottle). We got there early and were there for probably 8 hours. It was incredible. Think of awesome jungle hikes and a beautiful beach together in the same place. On the way in there will be multiple spots where people try to get you to park, just drive right by them. We parked in a lot nearby “Restaurante Donde Alex” (which we ate here after the park), and paid $20 cash for parking for the day if I remember correctly. It is as close as you can get to the park entrance. On the walk from the parking lot to the park entrance, there will be a bunch of people that try ask you if you need a guide inside the park, which may be helpful if you are into that type of thing and especially if you want to see wildlife. We decided not to get a guide. We were able to make our way all around the park no problem, and we seen all types of wildlife, monkeys, sloths, iguanas, birds, etc. we hiked around the park and hung out by the beach and it was awesome. Make sure you keep an eye on your bag if you leave it by the beach, the monkeys stole one or two other peoples bags.

Day 6 - We were so beat up tired from our trip that we just relaxed all day. Got massages, ate food (a good spot was “Coffee Stop”), did some gift shopping to bring stuff home for friends, hit the farmers market that was nearby (where we got the best hot sauce ever), and just took in the culture.

We left Quepos at Midnight to make it in time to return our rental car and get back to the airport for our 6 am flight back to LAX (I didn’t think this part though with the timing of everything, but we made it happen!). We got there a bit early, and had to wait for Vamos to open (which we called ahead and for a small fee they met us there early at 5 am and shuttled us to the airport). We got there early, and hung out at the Denny’s next door until the Vamos people got there. We returned the car and they took us to the airport no problems at all.


ADDITIONAL TIPS

- My girlfriend and I are big Foodies. The best part of the trip, was not the food. You can find good food definitely! But most places the food was just OK. I would not consider these areas to be “Foodie Destinations” by any means. “Sodas” are local casual dining spots. Eat at the sodas. The food is cheap, the people are nice, and you get a real genuine vibe of Costa Rica people. “Soda el Arenal” in La Fortuna was our favorite spot, the best food, and the nicest people running the place. I tried to mention the spots that we got good food above.

- The Coffee, Chocolate, and hot sauces were amazing!!!! We brought a bunch home and we wish we had brought home more.

- We are not the types to do certain kinds of tours, as we can feel constrained and slowed down sometimes. We like to run around and do our own thing. We got to see a bunch of wildlife throughout our trip. We never went out specifically on any kind of tour or event to go see wildlife. It just happened naturally while we were doing other things. And it was raining, which usually keeps the animals from being out and about. I’m not sure if we just got lucky, or if that’s common. However I will admit, at Manuel Antonio national park, the guides there are next level. They are able to see things you would never see. If this is super important to you to see animals, get a guide at Manuel Antonio. As I stated above, there are people outside the park that offer to be your guide, there are also people INSIDE the park who actually work at the park, that  are available to be your guide.

- We did not get to do Tabacon hot springs in La Fortuna. We did not know that we needed reservations, and they were booked like a month or 2 out when I looked. Everyone talks about it being so legendary, which I’m sure it is. However, “The Springs” was incredible, I can’t imagine how much better it can be. And they offer a 2 day pass that wasn’t very expensive, so it worked great for us to be able to pop in and out of the hot springs between our activities whenever we wanted.

- Obviously, you always have to be aware of your surroundings and watching out for anyone trying to jack you when you are traveling. We didn’t leave anything in the car unattended, and we didn’t bring anything around with us that we didn’t need to have. With that being said, I felt safer walking around Costa Rica in the middle of the night than I do walking around some parts of Los Angeles in the middle of the day. The locals in Costa Rica are all so nice. Everyone is very helpful. Even if they didn’t speak any English, they would still try to help point you in the right direction.

- We did not convert and cash (USD) to Colones (Costa rican currency). We used card most of the time, and cash some of the time. When I got home I realized that each time I swiped my card, there was a small “international transaction fee”. Not crazy, but worth mentioning. Also, I believe that at some spots, you are charged more if using CC or USD vs using Colones. We didn’t have any issues, but worth mentioning.

- In all the main touristy areas, most people spoke English either very well, or OK enough. As you get away from the touristy areas, don’t be surprised if people look at you with a blank stare if you are not speaking Spanish! Even still, everyone was very helpful. We used google translate to get us by where we needed to.



10 out of 10 would recommend anyone go to Costa Rica. We only seen a fraction of the country, but we were blown away. The vibe, the people, the environment, the activities… truly something special. 

I hope that this was helpful for anyone out there planning a trip. I am happy to answer any questions you may have or elaborate on anything as well.

I (19M) met her (20F) on a night out a couple of weeks back, and there was an instant attraction from both ends. We ended up both leaving our groups and just hanging out with each other, leading up to us making out quite a few times in the one night.

I kind of knew her from my university course, and always thought she was pretty but drunk confidence made me make a move and it worked really well.

We continued talking after that night as I genuinely felt a really good connection, and sparks have continued flying. It started out with some light hearted chat about music and how good the night out was, but recently it's progressed into really flirty texts, referencing our night out, but also more intimate acts like sex.

It's been so fun texting her and again the flirting has been reciprocated on both sides. We are currently in other parts of the world, but plan to meet for coffee when next semester starts, we're both calling it a date and we both seem really excited for it.

Problem is, I have no idea how to approach things ;)

Usually when I date someone, I'll meet them on the first date after talking and work up to making a move, this time things have happened in the opposite way and I'm wondering what that might mean for it.

Any advice on how best to handle this would be so appreciated, I really like talking to her and wanna try my best to make something of this.",5,1735353516.0,dating_advice,14,0.86,False

The kitchen. The Tuckers weren't particularly healthy eaters, with the pantry stocked full of sugary treats, crisps, coffee and dried fruit (like any other place with food packaging in the game tbh.) They cooked in large batches, as evidenced by the large pots on the stove.

1hnvrsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hnvrsc/dont_trust_the_other_you_in_the_mirror/,Don’t Trust the Other “You” in the Mirror,"I’m not sure when she stopped loving me. Maybe when I was laid off from work. Or when I was hospitalised for my mental break. Or maybe when she started fucking her PT, Mathew. Who knows? All is know is that when she ended it, it broke me.

The thought of life without her was incomprehensible to me. Alicia and I had been together since we were 15 - High school sweethearts. When we were both 19, I proposed. I still remember how scared I was. God, I was a fumbling mess. But regardless, somehow she said yes, and we began our life together. That was 16 years ago. We were inseparable. Unstoppable. That was until June of this year… It replays in my mind over and over. 

In January, I was laid off from work. Something about cutting costs, you know, the usual shit they hit you with. Unfortunately that didn’t stop the bills rolling in. The mortgage still needed to be paid, food still had to be put on the table and her handmade jewellery business wasn’t even coming close to covering it. I had always said I would provide for her so she could pursue what she loved to do. Yet here I was, being turned down for every job I applied for, taking out loans anywhere that would allow me to, borrowing from anyone I could. But still, we were days from losing the house. The stress was too much - The guilt was too much. So much so, that in March I found myself walking down a busy highway. No clothes, no shoes, and no recollection of how I got there. 

A passerby had alerted the police, who promptly took me to the local hospital. I was tested for alcohol and drugs but was found to be completely sober. That’s when they came to the conclusion I had suffered a mental break due to stress and sent me to the closest mental health facility. After seeing movies like One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Girl, Interrupted, I really didn’t have high hopes for this place, but much to my surprise, it was great. The doctors and nurses were incredibly helpful, the therapy sessions were wonderful and the other patients were people just like me, who had just lost their way. Alicia had come to visit me a few times but she seemed..off. Cold even. I put it down to me overthinking with my current state of mind.

After a few months, they had finally found medication that suited me, and coping techniques that helped me calm down. I was finally going home - Going home to Alicia. And I couldn’t wait. That is however, until I got home and realised her demeanour I felt at the hospital and put down to my overthinking, was in fact, very real. She looked at me differently. Stopped talking to me unless absolutely necessary. Started going to the gym more than she was home. Then finally in mid June, she hit me with the 5 words I dreaded the most.

“I can’t do this anymore”

My heart sank and my knees buckled. I couldn’t stop the flood of tears leaking from my eyes. 

“Please, I’ll do anything! Just give me another chance!” I pled. I must have looked so pathetic - But I was so overcome with emotion. She’s was my everything. My reason for living. I couldn’t remember life before her. But her expression never changed. She wouldn’t even look at me.

“I’m sorry. I’ve met someone else. I tried. I really did. But you’ve changed. You’re not the man I remember. You’re like a shell of him. I love you. I always will. But it’s not enough”

Truth be told, I saw this coming and yet still was somehow caught off guard by it. And with that, she turned and picked up two bags, already packed by the doorway - I hadn’t even noticed them. And that was it. I was alone. Alone for the first time in my life. No one to turn to. My parents were long gone by now and any friends I had drifted away from me when I was hospitalised or when I had text them constantly asking to borrow money. But I at least had my weekly therapy sessions.

“You know it’s not your fault Adam. You need to stop blaming yourself” Dr McAllister said in a reassuring tone, gazing at me over the top frame of her glasses, notebook and pen in hand. “Unfortunately things like this happen, but we have to find a way to go on. Have you been doing those written exercises I recommended?”

“Yeah..” I muttered while staring at the carpet. It was so filthy and cheap looking - When was the last time it was vacuumed? And god, that smell. What I assumed to be some fruity scented candle that was so overpowering it was sickening.

“Have you been taking your medication?”Dr McAllister said in a condescending tone. 

I could tell by the way she asked, she doubted me.

“Ofcourse I have” I snapped. “But pills can’t fix everything”

Dr McAllister sighed. “Listen Adam. Between you and I, I’ve been through more break ups than I’d like to admit - Even one divorce. Every single one feels like the end of the world. Trust me, I know. But somehow we find a way to carry on. It takes time and a lot of strength, but we manage eventually. I wish I could give you some amazing advice that would instantly take away your pain - but I’m just a therapist, I don’t have a magic wand. Unfortunately when it comes to something like this, it’s something you have to get through on your own. The tunnel will be long and dark, but there is light at the end, and you will make it”

“Wow, thanks Dr McAllister - I could have got that advice in any bullshit woman’s lifestyle magazine” I thought to myself as I sauntered out of her bleak, fruity smelling office. I left the office and let out a huge sigh. What a waste of time. I had no choice but to go home and resort to my new nightly routine - Two six packs and hours of video games. It was my way of shutting my brain off for a few hours. I walked into my eerily empty, silent house, kicked my shoes off and threw my keys in the bowl by the door. I threw my jacket on the couch and made my way to the kitchen. 

The dishes were piled high - honestly the house was a mess. Alicia would be disgusted. But I don’t care. There’s no one here to see the mess I live in - the mess I am.

I made my way to fridge and grabbed a can of Miller. I don’t particularly care for the taste, but it was cheap and I certainly wasn’t oozing money. I had a divorce to pay for. A house to try and save. I was living on ramen for gods sake. Safe to say I was flat broke. I continued into the living room and threw myself onto the couch with a thud, staring at the dimly lit ceiling. I had made a habit of turning on as little lights as possible. I had to save the electricity money and to be honest, I always found the dark quite comforting.

I wasted hours wandering around in Elden Ring til’ I couldn’t keep my eyes open any longer. Might as well try to sleep. I got up to turn off the tv as I had lost the remote to a moment of rage a couple of weeks back. I stumbled to the tv and shot a glance towards the mirror above the fireplace. I never understood the whole ‘mirror over the fireplace’ thing . A lot of people aren’t even tall enough to see themselves in it - Alicia was one of them. But she insisted on putting this huge vintage rectangular mirror with a gold baroque border above the fireplace. I always found it tacky, but according to her - I just had no taste.

I looked at my reflection and squinted. What happened to me? My face was covered in stubble, my eyes had huge black rings around them, my hair was longer than it should be and completely unkempt. I was disgusting. I stared at myself in awe. I became completely lost in my reflection when suddenly - I smiled. Well, I didn’t - my reflection did. At least I think it did? Nah, I must have imagined it. I probably should stop drinking on these meds.

I turned the tv off and slowly thudded my way up the stairs. I threw myself in my unmade mess of a bed and stared up at the ceiling - like I always did until I would fall asleep. But sleep never came. I couldn’t stop thinking. I couldn’t get that face out of my head - My face. But he looked so full of life. So alive. Not like me. Not like the shell I had apparently become.. I had to look again. I thudded back down the stairs and into the living room, feeling completely ridiculous as I did so - but I had to see. 

I found myself in-front of the mirror I hated so much, staring with anticipation. And after a few minutes, there he was, mirror-me, the man I wanted to be. I stared into his eyes and everything went numb. Minutes passed, hours passed- and next thing I knew, the sun had risen. It was morning. I had stood there all night, and was now looking back at that shell of a man, the me I hated - The real me. I felt absolutely insane. How could I stand there all night? Was I hallucinating? Had I officially lost it? 

The weirdest part was that I felt..comforted. Cathartic. The way you feel after you’ve told someone something you’ve never told anyone before - Like a huge weight was off my shoulders. The pain I had been feeling, the self loathing - it was all gone. It was like a high. That high was short lived however, because the tiredness of not sleeping all night finally hit me like a hard punch to the face. I made my way upstairs and fell asleep the minute I hit the pillow. When I woke, it was already evening. I stared at the time on my phone in shock. Since Alicia had left, I hadn’t managed more than a few hours, but today? Twelve. Twelve whole hours. Probably not considered healthy, but god, did I need it. 

I headed downstairs, into the kitchen and grabbed myself a drink of water. I stood against the worktop, sipping my water and flipping through Facebook. I really wish I hadn’t..

There she was. Alicia. And there he was - the home wrecking bastard, with his arm around her. They were smiling from ear to ear, with a beautiful sunset behind them. It was so generically cheesy - But I was overcome with rage and jealousy. She never looked that happy with me. Never. Had our relationship ment nothing to her? Was I that easy to forget? Did our vows even mean anything?  In sickness and in health? - Apparently not. For richer, for worse? - Ha, yeah right. I gripped the glass so hard, I felt it crack beneath my fingers. 

I needed him.
I needed mirror-me.

I ran to the mirror and stared at him, hands bracing the shelf above the fireplace, rocking and forth. Rage coursing through me - Then, again after a few moments - he appeared. Same smile. Same reassuring eyes - And I was numb again. Pure bliss. 

This became my daily routine. Sleep, eat and spend time with mirror-me. He was my safe space. My sanctuary. My best friend. I didn’t need anyone else. I didn’t need to feel or think. He started appearing to me on all the mirrors I had in the house - so I was never alone. And every day that I saw him, his smile seemed even bigger. The only downfall was, everyday after my “mirror therapy”, when the sun rose, the wave of tiredness that hit me was worse than the day before . I wasn’t even making it to the bed anymore. I was just sleeping on the couch.

It was now early October. The dark nights were getting longer, which ment more time with mirror-me. It was great. Even if his smile had now gotten unsettlingly big. I stared into his eyes and lost myself - like I did every night, when suddenly I was shocked back to into reality by a cheerful jingle. I glanced around the room in a confused daze. What the hell was that? It took me a few seconds to come to the realisation, it was my phone! I can’t remember the last time it went. I almost forgot what it sounded like. I scrambled over to my phone and was instantly taken aback to see who was calling. A picture of Alicia and I filled the screen. What the fuck does she want?

I took a deep breath and answered. 

“Adam?” She enquired. I expected hearing her voice to send me into a spiral, but I felt nothing. Nada. Not a thing.
“Adam? Are you there?”

“What do you want Alicia?” I bluntly asked.

She sounded caught off guard. “There’s no need to be hostile - I know we left each other on bad terms, but I just wanted to check on you. I passed the house a few times this week and the house was in complete darkness. Are you o-“

“I’m fine” I snapped. “And how I am or what I’m doing is no longer your concern, nor is it your busin-“

“Adam” Alicia interjected. “we may not be together anymore - but I still care about you! I couldn’t live with myself knowing you were sitting suffering! I-“

I interrupted her with hysterical laughter. “You care about me? Did you care about me when you were disappearing to fuck him?- in-fact, you know what? I don’t care. I don’t care any more. I’m not wasting my breath on you. I don’t need you. I don’t need anyone. I hate you, and I genuinely hope the rest of your life is full of misery and suffering”

I was met with silence from the other end of the phone. I broke it by delivering one final blow. 

“Now if you’re done snooping to see if I’m still pining after you, I’d like to go and get back to enjoying my freedom. I don’t want to hear your shrill voice in my ears again. You make me sick”. And with that, I hung up.

I was shocked at myself - Yeah I was mad at her, sure. But I still loved her. Why did I talk to her like that? I would never talk to her like that. That was when I realised, I was smiling. So hard it hurt my cheeks I turned to mirror and noticed I was smiling just like him, and instead of the comfort it usually gave me - it filled me with unease. Something felt wrong. Very wrong. I slowly stood up and backed out of the room. I needed to get to a room without a mirror. I needed to be alone for a minute. I needed to be away from him. I ran to our spare room. I knew that was mirror free at least. I sat on the end of the bed. I don’t understand what’s going on. I don’t know what to do. I can’t exactly call the police and tell them I think there’s something wrong with the ‘me’ in the mirror. Nor can I call my therapist, cause the only help I’ll get is a straight jacket and a padded room. So I turned to the only place I could - The internet. There are all sorts of people on there, surely at least one is bound to believe me or know something.

And so I googled about mirror entities, demons - what ever I could think of and scoured the results from top to bottom. That’s when I saw a post on a forum amply titled “Don’t trust the other you in the mirror”. I stared in awe. I don’t like the sound of this.. I clicked and began to read. The post was by a user named “Spiritwalker67”.

It read:

“Ok, I know I’m going to sound insane, but I couldn’t live with myself if I knew I hadn’t at least tried to warn others.

I had been attending AA meetings regularly. I had hit rock bottom and was really struggling. I was at my lowest when a woman named Tina approached me and asked if we could be each other sponsors. I wasn’t super into the idea but I was willing to try.

She was lovely and really seemed to have it together. So much that I honestly wondered why she was even there. It was during our fourth phone call that she told me something I wish she hadn’t. She could tell I was sinking further and had a suggestion for me. 

“I know this is going to sound crazy, but please don’t dismiss it without trying at least once.” 

I was already rolling my eyes but I thought I’d hear her out. I was desperate. That’s when she told me about something she had named “mirror therapy”. She told me to dim the lights in my apartment and stare at myself in a mirror and meditate. Lose myself. She again stated she knew how crazy this sounded but assured me that the sense of inner peace I would feel would be worth it.

Fuck it, as I said, I was desperate. I figured I’d try. And much to my amazement, it worked, beyond belief. Not only that but I felt like my reflection was staring at me with kind reassurance. The look I had so wished my family and friends had given me. 

I became addicted to mirror therapy. I lived for it. However I noticed that when I wasn’t at the mirror I was overcome with lethargy. It was unbearable. If I left the house, I was like a zombie. It wasn’t until I went to AA a few weeks later and saw Tina, that I put two and two together.

Tina wandered in, but she wasn’t her usual odd, quirky self. No, she was.. empty. Dazed. I walked up to her to ask if she was ok and audibly gasped when she turned to face me with a face like a blank sheet of paper and eyes with no shine or life in them. She was like ..an empty vessel. And that’s when it started to come together. My lethargy, Tina’s zombie-like state. It was the mirrors. It had to be. I had no other explanation. I refused to believe Tina had relapsed or anything like that because she was doing so well and really had her mind set on getting her life together.

I didn’t know where to turn - the internet was providing nothing, so I went to the only other place I could think of for answers. The library.

I scoured the occult section from top to bottom for any mention of mirrors, it was the only place I could think to look and eventually I found something. And it filled me with anxiety. It spoke about spirits within the mirror and how when you were at your most vulnerable the veil between us and them was in a weakened state. It went on to explain that everytime you look into the mirror or “other realm”, the being at the other side takes pieces of your soul, until eventually there’s nothing left, and you are empty. The only way to save yourself is to close their doorway forever. In other words- break all your mirrors. It’s that simple. And so I headed home and did just that. Within weeks my energy came back, and I was back to my old struggling self, which I never thought I’d miss.

Again -  I know I sound insane, but in hopes I reach just one stranger out there, going through what Tina and I went through, please take my advice and don’t trust the other you in the mirror. Destroy it before it destroys you”

I sat there with my mouth agape. I was shocked, scared and for some reason, felt betrayed. Even though mirror me never spoke, I still felt like he had lied to me. He had given me a false sense of security, made me feel like I had a friend - I had no choice but to say goodbye to the friend I had counted on for months, who never judged me or made me feel crazy. But I couldn’t say goodbye without first confronting him. Stupid - I know, it’s not like he was going to answer me. But I had to get it off my chest and I at least needed this relationship to have some closure.

I wandered back down the stairs - slowly walking, eyes to the ground, towards the mirror. I couldn’t help but feel heartbreak. I slowly rose my eyes to the fireplace mirror I had grown to love and was greeted by my familiar comforting face. His smile was even bigger than last time. Now that I knew what I did about him, that smile made me incredibly uncomfortable.

I looked him in the eyes.

“I know what you are. I know what you’re doing. I’m sorry, but I can’t let you have me” My eyes fell to the ground. “Even knowing what you are, I still can’t help but want to thank you. You were the only one who was there for me at my lowest. I won’t forget you”

I looked up to meet his gaze one last time and felt the most intense fear I have ever felt surge through my body. That smile - that smile was gone. Now he was frowning. Not just frowning, it was indescribable. Full of anger. It was evil. His eyes were so wide they looked like they were about pop out of his head at any moment. But I couldn’t look away. That’s when he did something that made me feel fear like I had never felt before. His eyes got wider and his mouth began to open, wider and wider. Not horizontally like a smile, but vertically. Wider than was humanly possible. I took a step back trying not to take my eyes off him as I mindlessly reached around the room trying to grab anything heavy enough to shatter that god awful face. My aimless flailing was getting me nowhere, and I adverted my gaze for less than a second to grab the huge ugly candle holder on the coffee table that Alicia had got one Christmas from her mother. As I turned back to throw it, I was met with something I couldn’t believe I was seeing. Hands. So many hands. Seeping from every part of the mirror, reaching for me, grabbing for me. I closed my eyes tightly and threw a Hail Mary. I couldn’t open my eyes. I just prayed and waited for the obscene amount of hands to grab me and do whatever they were going to do to me. When suddenly, the sound of glass cracking. A beautiful choir of shattering. I opened my eyes to see that mirror I had grown so fond of had broken into a hundred pieces. I had never felt such relief. I exhaled hard. It was like i had been holding my breath for what felt like minutes without even realising. I ran upstairs and smashed all the other small mirrors that remained within the house without looking at them. It was done. It was over.

And with that. He was gone- Forever. My friend. My therapist. My mirror-me. 

My energy gradually returned to me over the weeks - and so did my pain and sadness. But I’d rather feel that than nothing at all. I still see him in my dreams though. Almost every night actually. Sometimes he has that comforting smile I had grown so attached to, but other times he had that god awful stretched, otherworldly mouth and frightfully wide eyes. I hate those dreams. But at least I’m alive - Soul-intact - and starting to get my life back on track little by little.

So, I’ll leave you with this - the same advice “Spiritwalker67” gave me, which saved my life.

No matter how good it makes you feel.
No matter how amazing at peace you are.

1hnvrdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1hnvrdm/bleaching_possible/,Bleaching possible?,"Hello everyone,

I have a question about teeth whitening and hope someone here might know more about it (maybe even a dentist).

Over the years, my coffee consumption has caused my teeth to yellow a bit, and I’d like to have a bleaching treatment done. However, my dentist mentioned that it could cost around 4,000 euros. The reason for this is an old dental injury:

In my early twenties, I had an accident on a dance floor and lost half of one of my front teeth and a canine tooth (bottle, elbow, tooth – you can imagine the rest). Since then, I’ve had composite fillings on both teeth, which look great aesthetically.

My dentist explained that during the bleaching process, the composite material wouldn’t lighten. Her solution would be to remove the composite, whiten the teeth, and then place new fillings in a lighter shade. That makes sense to me so far.

However, she also said that the composite wouldn’t stain from future coffee consumption, which could create a color difference between the natural teeth and the composite. This part doesn’t make much sense to me because, before I started drinking coffee, the composite definitely discolored over the years. Back then, my teeth were bright white, and the discoloration only came later—something the composite also seemed to pick up. So, it appears that composite material can discolor, right? She claimed it doesn’t and assured me that the composite was initially placed in that shade.

I also asked her if the bleaching process could damage the composite or the bond between the tooth and the filling, but she said that wouldn’t happen.

Now I’m wondering if I’m being offered an unnecessarily expensive treatment because I’m 100% sure that no yellow-tinted composite was placed back then, and my teeth, along with the composite, definitely discolored over the years. Additionally, I’d like to know if the bleaching process could harm the composite material.

Thanks for your help!",1,1735353218.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Although I haven’t received my score yet, I wanted to share my experience to help others preparing for the exam.

General Tips:
Take Breaks Between the Two Days (If Possible):
The exam is long and mentally exhausting. A break between the two days can help you recharge and maintain stamina.

Use the 45 min+ tutorial break for MCQ 6 blocks:
The tutorial can be skipped to add more break time. I used this time entirely for the six MCQ blocks, which was extremely helpful.

CCS Strategy:
Cases end Early – If you complete a case before the allotted time, the remaining time gets added to subsequent cases. This is a great way to accumulate extra minutes for breaks

Back-to-Back CCS Cases: I chose to complete all my CCS cases in one go because I just wanted to finish the exam and leave the center. I ended up finishing about 45 minutes early.

MCQ Blocks (Day 2):
Each block of 30 MCQs felt more manageable compared to Day 1. I consistently had 2-3 minutes left at the end of each block, unlike the first day, where I often ran out of time.

Exam Content & Preparation:
Topics Covered: There were no questions on drug ads, biostats, or mechanisms of action (MOA). However, Step 1 content like microbiology and pharmacology still appeared. Know your ENT ophtha well too. Basically expect questions from each system even Biochem or immuno.

Preparation Resources:
I relied heavily on my job experience, USCE, and general exam prep, as no Qbank seemed to fully prepare me for this section.
Key PDFs to review include:

Mehlman Risk PDF https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cuSO02Ly9WLnUS88M1qIzlOYntXgJ05R/view

Divine PDF https://docs.google.com/file/d/10I6KnZ-dwnNTRkrPzQKoxQ1g03moWINP/edit?filetype=msword

The Collective PDF (floating around online) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ni5fvv0_D07Rtwgd55J9yLkLdC8FjqWU/view

Question Themes: A significant portion of the exam focused on prognosis and the natural course of conditions.

If Unsure of an Answer: When in doubt, lean toward answers that suggest:
Spontaneous resolution, 
Reassurance and 
Normal aging
(This won’t always be correct, but it’s often better than selecting invasive options unless you’re certain.)

Integrating CCS Knowledge with MCQs:

CCS Practice: While solving CCS cases, I made note of tests and treatments suggested by UWorld, treating them as part of my differential diagnosis process.
Practical Application: For example:
A 30-year-old female with vaginal bleeding doesn’t need an endometrial biopsy unless risk factors are present or she is over 40. This detail helped during MCQs.
Similarly, I reinforced the differences in treatment for cystitis vs. pyelonephritis (avoid nitrofurantoin for pyelo and ceftriaxone for cystitis).

If you dont have much time to prepare for CCS know - https://www.reddit.com/r/Step3/s/4BWN9gfoJR

ALSO PLEASE PLEASE DO THE 6 ONLINE MOCK CCS CASES ON FREE137. Real interface is shittier. Please read the explanations as to what will give you score, what will deduct your score and what wont matter even if you type. 
This truly prepared me in the sense I understood when to order how many tests. If it was an office case I would be lenient and order a lot of tests, meanwhile in emergency i would focus on the sole problem and associated tests and order more tests if time permitted. For example in a patient with tension pneumothorax dont start ordering cbc cmp, its an emergency and diagnosed clinically ao even xray should be deferred. Immediately do the needle thoracentesis or chest tube and later order the tests you want( if you do procedure later you’d definitely get a negative update). 


Final Thoughts:
Rest and Breaks: The exam is exhausting, so take full advantage of breaks – have coffee, wash your face, and reset.

Don't Overthink Answers: Avoid checking your answers afterward. It won’t change the outcome.

Stay Positive and Calm: Relax, pray, and trust your preparation. Good luck to everyone preparing – and to me while I wait for my results!

Edit: Wish I could share my Uworld and CCS acount, both expire in 2 days sorry guys :(

1hnvocl,https://www.reddit.com/r/girladvicefromgirls/comments/1hnvocl/been_advice_on_men/,Been advice on men ,"I need advice , sooo there is this guy.

I have developed a crush on but I am unsure  if he is just nice or flirting. Ahhhhhhhh 

I have had a situation similar (everyone thought he liked me (even my teachers in High school lol), he was touchy, always complemented me , wanted to be alone and he was a very shy guy, so anyways, we went out for coffee which I thought was a date, turns out … it wasn’t … I told him I liked him and he said he didn’t like me in that way etc…) 

Now back to the present… lol 

This guy (different one) is super nice to everyone just his personality but sometimes I feel like it’s a bit more (my friend I go to uni with said don’t read into it because he is nice , and sometimes he will pat her on the back too). 
However, it’s been more, always wanting to hang out.  I am just stupid sometimes maybe to think , just maybe he might like me . Idk wtf is wrong with me lol. 

he will ask me personal questions where everyone else don’t (guys). 

I asked him if he was dating anyone , he said no , it’s been 8 years when he was in high school. 
His girlfriend broke up with him due to him being an  asshole back then. 

So I said I am sorry to hear that, he said he has been working on himself for the last 8 years , and a people pleaser kind of nice to make sure he doesn’t hurt anyone and to include everyone , so he is nice to everyone. 

But then…. My stupid brain and heart think it’s more when he …. 

Then he will brush together or when I passed my phone, he will brush my fingers. And smile . 
Again not sure if it’s by accident or . 

I feel like I am reading into more. But ever time I see him he makes me think it’s something more 

He is very cute too . 

Also, when we were in the lecture theatre (rows of seats) , a couple friends and I sat together. 

But at break the girls moved because we were sitting to close to the screen and it was hurting their necks. 

Anyways, 
But then I said to the gig  if it’s hurting your neck and you want to sit with them by all means go ahead. He said no I am fine sitting here , I said you’re sure Because it’s only us lol. I laughed out loud he said yes. T
hen he said it’s comfy here.  

Cause he could have moved because he was clearly uncomfortable sitting in that chair with his neck. But he choose to sit with me . So nice or just didn’t want to leave me alone . I guess. 

This week I am on winter break (or Christmas break), and he has been texting me lots , always him first never me. 
Just saying Wyd or heyy how are you? Etc. like everyday. 

Which is very not like him. 

So ya lol sorry for the long story. 

What y’all think?

1hnvkn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1hnvkn9/venting_frustrated_burnt_out/,venting— frustrated & burnt out ,"hello! 


this is my first post on here. i’m just seeking some advice for my current situation. i’m burnt out and overwhelmed so idk how much all of this will make sense. also, i have a therapist and all that but just need some advice on this situation since im expected to give an answer as to my availability…


so basically— i don’t wanna spend time with my family but feel guilty if i dont. 

my family overwhelms me very easily, along with triggering me (i have ptsd and very complicated family history). i do not have a good family dynamic but we try to make it work, i try to show up at least to the big family gathering at christmas, i mostly show up to see and spend time with my grandpa who’s my only living grandparent. 

My mom always makes me feel like shit if i don’t show up to things and feels like she has to make excuses for me— my family doesn’t really take no as an answer as it makes them uncomfortable for some reason. Like i tell my boyfriend all the time flat out that i don’t wanna go to things and i can always be honest with him but with my family, they get so offended by these things. 

For some reason my aunts are weirdly obsessed with spending time with me and like a lot of other people do— they think of me as this weird like pokémon they need to catch. like they have to spend time with me so they can brag to someone that they did— it’s so weird idk if this make sense. 

Basically— i just had christmas with my family and my overbearing aunt wants to spend time with me again, which will snowball into her constantly asking me to go out to coffee or do things alone with her (which i only do with a tiny amount of people). My aunt asked for us to do a girls night with all the girls in my family— i’ve gotten out of doing this before, because to be frank i am not interested. this actually happens like every few years, my aunt gets obsessed and pushes to hang out with my and constantly talks to my mom about me until my mom tells her to lay off, then she does and barely contacts me… just for christmas to come back up and the cycle continues. 

also— im sober and my family drinks a lot during family gatherings and i hate being around drunk obnoxious people, knowing that they’ll be drinking and it’ll be a late night activity makes me want to go even less.

 I often tell my mom im interested in shorter activities like going out to coffee for an hour— that way i have control over when i leave and don’t have to make excuses. 

so basically— Should i be honest and tell my mom i don’t want to go because im burnt out and that i don’t wanna do things alone with my aunt? or should i just make an excuse. the excuse is so much easier in my brain. 


i might end up deleting this since it’s just me rambling, doesn’t make sense and is a bit personal, so if ur still reading and or give me advice— thank you. ",5,1735352614.0,AutismInWomen,4,0.86,False
1hnvjdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1hnvjdh/the_thing_in_the_mirror/,The Thing in the Mirror,"I’m writing this because I don’t think I have much time left. If I don’t make it through tonight, maybe someone will believe me. Or at least, they’ll know it wasn’t just grief that drove me mad.

It all started a week ago, when I rented the cabin.

I needed to get away. After Emily died—my wife—I couldn’t stand the suffocating silence of our house. Her coffee mug still sat in the sink, her books stacked on the nightstand. Everywhere I looked, I saw her absence. So, I packed a bag, found a cheap Airbnb in the mountains, and drove up with a single thought in my head: I needed to be alone.

The cabin wasn’t much. Just a squat little thing surrounded by trees that seemed to stretch endlessly in every direction. It smelled faintly of mildew when I walked in, but it was clean enough. There was a fireplace, a lumpy couch, and a small kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘80s. The bedroom was down a short hallway, past a single bathroom with one of those old-fashioned mirrors bolted to the wall above the sink.

It wasn’t glamorous, but it was quiet. That’s all I wanted.

The first night, I slept better than I had in months.

The second night was when I noticed the mirror.

I had been chopping vegetables for dinner, letting my mind wander, when I realized I hadn’t checked myself in a mirror since I’d arrived. It was such a weird thought—random, intrusive—but it lodged itself in my head. I wandered down the hallway to the bathroom and flicked on the light.

At first, I didn’t notice anything unusual. Just my reflection staring back at me: hollow cheeks, bags under my eyes, and stubble I hadn’t bothered to shave. But as I turned to leave, something made me stop.

My reflection wasn’t moving.

I froze, my hand still on the doorframe. My reflection just… stood there, staring at me, its head tilted slightly to the side like it was studying me. The longer I looked, the more wrong it felt. Its eyes seemed a little too wide, the corners of its mouth twitching ever so slightly.

I blinked.

So did it.

And suddenly, it was normal again.

I stumbled back into the hallway, my heart pounding. I told myself it was just a trick of the light, that I was tired, that maybe grief was finally messing with my head.

I didn’t go back to the bathroom that night.

The next few days, things got worse.

I started avoiding mirrors entirely. I didn’t even know why—just that every time I passed by one, I felt like something was *watching me*. That same weird, crawling sensation at the back of my neck.

But mirrors have a way of sneaking up on you. The window over the kitchen sink reflected just enough to catch a glimpse of myself when I washed my hands. The black screen of my phone, lying face up on the coffee table, would flash my face when I reached for it. And every time, I thought I saw something move—a flicker of motion that didn’t quite match mine.

It wasn’t until the fifth night that I realized I wasn’t imagining things.

I was brushing my teeth in the bathroom, trying to keep my eyes on the sink instead of the mirror. But as I turned off the faucet, I heard it—a soft *tapping*. Like fingernails, tapping against glass.

I froze.

The sound wasn’t coming from the window. It was coming from the mirror.

I looked up, and my stomach dropped.

My reflection was smiling.

Not a normal smile. It was too wide, its teeth bared in a way that didn’t match my face at all. Its head twitched, just slightly, and its eyes locked onto mine.

Then, it raised its hand—and waved.

I screamed and stumbled backward, knocking over the trash can. By the time I dared to look again, the reflection was normal. It was just me.

But I knew what I’d seen.

Last night, the thing in the mirror stopped pretending.

I woke up around 3 a.m. to the sound of glass shattering. It took me a moment to realize it was coming from the bathroom. My first thought was that a tree branch had broken the window, but when I opened the door, the window was fine.

The mirror, however, was cracked right down the middle.

My reflection stood in the shards, fractured and wrong. It didn’t move as I stared at it, its face split into jagged fragments. But then, one of the shards shifted—*it moved*, as if something was crawling behind the glass.

I backed out of the bathroom, slamming the door behind me, and grabbed my keys. I didn’t care if it was the middle of the night—I was leaving.

But as I ran to the front door, I stopped cold.

The living room window was reflecting me. So was the TV. So was the glossy surface of the picture frame on the wall. Everywhere I turned, I saw myself staring back. And in every single reflection, *I wasn’t alone.*

There was something standing behind me.

I’ve barricaded myself in the bedroom now, but it doesn’t matter. The bedroom mirror is on the closet door, and I can hear it tapping.

It’s been tapping for hours.

I don’t know what it wants, but I’m too afraid to look. If anyone reads this, don’t go near mirrors. Don’t let them see you. Because once they do, they won’t stop.

And if you ever see something move behind you…

Don’t turn around.

I looked.

God help me, I looked.

I’m not doing well. The food here makes me sick. I’m badly injured and haven’t seen a real doctor in a long time. 

I thought about you all day today. They stole what you gave me. I know who did it. I had it for a year until I grabbed it from my bag so I know I’m being watched. They stole it the next day. 

I washed my hair last night. Do you remember going to the festival and seeing the clowns? I still remember seeing the one with shampoo all over their wig. It was so funny.  

I’m getting old, but am still in decent shape for my age! Not like I was, but ok considering I haven’t been able to do anything for a year.

1hnvfj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweatystartup/comments/1hnvfj6/what_i_learned_in_pricing_my_jobs_and_my_hope_it/,What I Learned in Pricing My Jobs and My Hope it Can Help People Starting Out,"Occasionally, I'll see newer startups asking ""how much should I charge for x"" type questions It's a legitimate question. I am glad you’re asking.

But, I think you need to understand that for those of us with experience, the answer isn't easy for us to give. Why? Well, there are variables only you know... or maybe even haven't figured out yet.

Yes! It’s a legitimate concern and a question to pose because pricing can make or break your business. Charge too little, and yes, you might win the job—but you’ll work tirelessly just to scrape by. Charge too much, and you might scare potential customers away. The goal for you is to find that sweet spot where your pricing reflects the value of your work, allows you to grow, and, most importantly, sustains your business.

But, we can’t answer this accurately for you. Not unless you have figured out some basic information that, honestly, you should always be mindful of. What does it cost you to operate?

I want to say this again, folks, because it is something I didn’t do when I first started out and it cost me. Before you can even think about setting your prices, you need to know what it costs YOU to operate (not me, not anyone else here. Your costs will be different than anyone else’s). This is true whether you’re a solo operator or you’re managing a team.

So, I want to take just a little time and run through how you can figure this out. I write this from the perspective of a landscaping and hardscaping business because that's my experience. But it applies to many home service businesses because we face many of the same expenses and challenges. 

Let’s start with a few definitions. Here’s where we break it down:

Fixed      expenses: These are costs you incur no matter how much work you do.      Think of things like your truck payment, insurance, software      subscriptions, and any tools or equipment you own that need maintenance.      Rent for a shop. Phones. Website…you should have the picture

Variable      expenses: These are costs that depend on how much work you’re doing.      For example, fuel, materials for jobs, or extra labor you bring on for      specific projects.

Even if you're just starting out and working by yourself, these expenses exist, and you need to account for them.

I do everything which is a fixed cost as a monthly calculation, so, even if your insurance is one lump payment at the beginning of the year, divide that by 12 and get your monthly cost. If you have a salaried team member and pay them weekly, or even yourself, that too is a fixed cost. But, since you pay them weekly, take that weekly salary and multiply it by 4.33 (there are 52 weeks in a year, 12 months in a year which comes to the most accurate way to express this, 4.33).

Once you have your fixed expenses covered you will have calculated your overhead.

I will give a super simple example because putting it in a post would be confusing if I got too far in the details. Let’s say you have insurance (truck and liability insurance) of $400/month, and you pay yourself $3,000/month and your website is $50/month and your phone is another $100/month….boy, you’re running lean. Great Job! LOL…..Your monthly overhead is $3550.00/month.

That is what you need to cover, plus any variable expenses just to break even. But you also want to make a profit. So, you need to set a margin for that.

Before we get there, though, let’s talk about production hours. I am sure you have already realized that you may start working at 7 and finish at 6 in the evening or later. That’s 11 hours at work. But, not all of those hours are actually production hours. You have loading and unloading time, maybe stopping for gas and supplies and those infernal energy drinks everyone’s chugging (honestly guys, what the hell is wrong with good old coffee???), drive time….all these things are considered non production.

 When you are making money, whether it’s cutting a lawn or removing landscape that is production hours.

How many hours a day are you actually producing? You need to know that. It should be something you are always tracking and fine tuning. You want to be out the door and earning as quickly as possible (and you should be fine tuning this all the time). So, let’s say on an 11 hour day you are spending 9 of them producing, because you’re a hard charger, right?

OK…some math again. You work 5 days a week, producing 9 hours each day. That means you are producing 45 hours of the week. We already discussed how a month is 4.33 weeks so we take our 45 hours, multiply it by 4.33 and we come up with 194.85 production hours a month. Let’s call it 195.

Take your overhead of $3550 and divide by 195 and your hourly overhead cost is $18.20.
So, when you are looking at a job, before you even figure out what to charge you know that you have to charge at least $18.20/hour just to break even. Now, you add in your variable costs. How much will gas cost? Any labor you use (and this is an entirely different post because there are a lot of hidden costs in labor that need to be considered like your portion of taxes, unemployment, work comp, benefits, if you give vacation to them paid then they need to earn that amount also during their working time….), materials, dump fees, blade replacements, breakage etc.

You want to add all that in as well and calculate. So, I will make this simple. You have a job you think will take three hours. You are going to have a laborer help you at the rate of $22/hour. You will use $3.00 in gas and dump fees of $80.00 plus an hour to and at the dump.

That’s 4 hours labor at $22.00 for $88.00 in labor, $80.00 dump fee and $3.00 gas.

Total? $171.00 in variable costs.

Divide that by estimated hours to complete which is $171.00/4 giving you a variable rate of $42.75/hour.

Add your hourly fixed costs to this $42.75+$18.20 and you get a base rate of $60.95/hour.

We aren’t done. You need a profit. You need to determine what rate you want. Here, we will say 30%. Take your $60.95 and divide by 0.7 (1-0.3 is how that’s determined) and you get a rate of $87.07/hour.

So, for this theoretical job you want to charge $87.07 times the estimated hours of 4 and you get $348.28…I would round up to $349.00

Now that you know your hourly rate, let’s talk about something equally important: your minimum charge. This is the amount you charge just to show up for a job, regardless of how small it is. Why? Because even if a job only takes 20 minutes, you’ve still spent time driving there, loading up your truck, and prepping.

For example, if your base hourly rate is $60, you wouldn’t charge $20 for a 20-minute job—you’d lose money. Instead, set a minimum charge that ensures your time and effort are covered, even for small jobs. This might be $100, $150, or whatever makes sense based on your calculations.

Pricing isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer. It takes work to figure out your numbers, but once you do, you’ll have confidence in your pricing and peace of mind knowing you’re not leaving money on the table—or working yourself into the ground for too little.

If you need further help with this, just ask! I have tried to explain this as simply as I can in a post. It always seems easier when I would sit down with my team and explain this in the conference area!

I do have a spreadsheet you can use to plug in your numbers and figure out your rates—it’ll make the process much easier. If you think that’ll help you just reach out and I will share it with you.

1hnvf8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hnvf8f/at_what_point/,At what point?,"So I'm F 29 5'3"" 205lbs. I've nearly always been over weight expect for a short (4 years) in college when I didn't have a healthy relationship with food. At that time I was actually the size your ""supposed"" to be according to BMI. Since then I have repaired my relationship with food (yay!) And I mostly cook for myself at home. I've done everything obvious that I can think of to reduce calories. Ie: fat free cheese, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, mostly drink water, once every 6-8 months I'll have a sprite, black coffee, lean meats, lots of fiber through veggies and fruits, replacing desserts with fruit, regular bread with keto bread, egg whites replace most egg consumption. I meal prep. I work out 3-4 times a week for an hour. 1 session is with a personal trainer and the other 2-3 times is a crossfit class. I can deadlift 265lbs, front squat 175 lbs, back squat 200lbs, bench 165lbs. I work a fairly active job, carrying mail at the post office. And I just don't lose any damn weight. Tracking macros or calories isn't an option for me long term cause that's what caused my bad relationship with food in the first place. What else can I do? I think I eat fairly well, I have an active job, I exercise, I get enough sleep, and I don't have any known health concerns (just got a physical within the last year -everything is normal) 

As a reference a typical day goes as such: wake up at 4:30, go to the gym at 5:15-6:15, come home eat breakfast (today was a breakfast burrito-which has 2 eggs, carb smart tortilla, 1 oz of bacon cut into small peices, 1 oz cheese and 2 oz of green/red pepper) go to work (9,800 steps from work alone), lunch (was a protien shake, apple, 4 oz deli turkey), go home (dinner was 4 street sized corn tortilla tacos with homade carintas, verde, white onion and cilantro.) Usually in bed and asleep by 8:30-9pm. 

At what point do I give up? At what point do I consider something like bariatric surgery or weight loss medications? Would that even help? I feel so stuck in this journey I don't know what else to do. Reddit tell me what I'm doing wrong!!",3,1735352115.0,loseit,3,0.71,False
1hnvdx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurConnect/comments/1hnvdx8/seeking_a_mentor_investor_preferably_in_australia/,Seeking A Mentor / Investor - Preferably In Australia,"# Why A 30 Year Old Man Could Be The Most Interesting Investment Of Your Life

I am Jake, a budding entrepreneur screaming out for a door to open, that provides me with the resources I need to build, launch and scale a huge and constantly growing portfolio of novel business ideas, physical products, SAAS products and digital offerings.

To you I am nobody, but I have collected quite a few humbling achievements, and have a burning desire to both disrupt industries and share my ideas with others who can help me in doing so.

Further on in this email, I will share with you businesses I have already built, launched and scaled myself, my background, experience and story. *Please know, this is not a generic post. I wrote this post myself, and I implore you to keep reading, if for no other reason than out of curiosity.*

**Tl;dr** \- I am Jake, proud recipient of “Young Trade Entrepreneur Of The Year 2023”. I am a 24/7 innovator, problem solver, learning obsessed individual with an ever growing portfolio of proudly novel ideas and products. Ideas that I want to share with someone who is willing to jump onboard, ideas that I am not sentimental too and that I 100% believe can make both a difference in the world and industry and disrupt markets.

I am seeking an opportunity to meet someone, who may be interested in giving a passionate entrepreneur like myself a chance to prove I can walk the walk as well as I talk the talk.

I could write for pages and pages here, but I am not here to waste your time. Right now, I am just trying to find someone with an open mind, who may (or may not be) looking for someone new and exciting, innovative and passionate to invest in.

 I just want to put myself and my story in front of you, and see if there is an opportunity for us to connect, chew the fat, and hopefully start the beginning of a relationship.

I do not want to pitch you. I could, but I prefer to talk and explain what I am all about. 

**To give a little context about me.**

* I have a construction background, but am highly educated and passionate about many other industries and areas, like AI, IT, Management, marketing and others.
* I started my landscaping business in 2020. Grew it to 500k revenue in 3 years, starting with $0. Built my website myself, grew to the top of Google organically, and had a lead generating machine with $0 spend.
* **Started a side business, relating to retail, buying & selling, with profit margins of 5,000% - 10,000% (yes, they are they correct numbers, which I can provide proof of if you’d like)**
* I have a 50+ page booklet of some of my ideas, business plans, and products, most of which are now outdated as I have many more.
* The last 6 months I have been generating multiple new business ideas and models, with researched business plans and value propositions, all which I believe I could scale to $1+ million in 12 months with the right resources.
* Have designed 5+ novel physical products, relating to the construction industry. Truly disruptive products, which I have acquired industry feedback (under NDA’s) to the likes of “Why hasn’t anybody done that? You’ll retire!” Currently I have a metal fabricator who is obsessed with them and wants to build a company.
* Have a list of 5-10 SAAS products, which grows every other day. 
* I have written and launched a 40 page eBook titled “How To Build A Profitable Service Based Business For Less Than 1k”.
* I had goals to write and release a newsletter around my ideas, my methodology around innovation, which I am 30 pages into.
* Reached out to a VC firm here and ended up catching up with a board member every week for coffee, who had some surprisingly nice things to say about me.

By now you may have the impression that I am an absolute unit and I don’t want to keep rambling too long. But the truth is, my mind just does not stop. And I hope I have managed to convey enough to establish a bit of an about me. 

I have always been completely obsessed with learning. Learning everything and anything. Any subject, any industry. I love to know how things work, why things are the way they are.

And right now, I do not have the resources or network to get most of my ideas off of the ground and so I am looking for a mentor, a potential investor, not just in my ideas, but in me. I have so much I want to share with the right person, so much value I want to add and I do not care for greediness.

**What's In It For You?**

***I would rather own 10% of a company built around an idea I created, over taking my ideas to the grave with me.***

I care not for sole or majority ownership of anything I currently build or create. I have so many ideas, I'd love to just be able to focus on one at a time, and release a long line of products, different industries, different setups.

With any luck, an investor would own the other 90%. Anyway, I will leave it at that for now. 

*Put simply, at this point I am reaching out for the opportunity to start a conversation and have a chat, nothing more.*   
You may want me to prove I'm worth my salt, in which case I would implore you to give me a task, a challenge, maybe to come up with an innovative solution to a problem. Any industry.

Anyway, thanks for coming to my TedTalk. Look forward to hearing from any interested parties!",1,1735351996.0,EntrepreneurConnect,0,1.0,False
