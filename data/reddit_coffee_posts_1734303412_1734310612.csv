Any advise?,"I dated this guy for 3ish months, and now that he ghosted me, I’m trying to understand what went wrong. I know it’s lost, but I want to learn how to improve next time.

We matched online and hit it off with shared interests like anime, witty banter, and books, but we're also pretty different. He loves beer and staying up late, while I've health issues that need a healthy lifestyle. He used to joke about turning me into a night owl.

Our dates were mostly good, but there were some odd moments. Early on, he shared insecurities about his looks and how he loves formal clothes but avoids wearing them because he fears looking weird. I didn’t know how to respond and just listened quietly. I also noticed he avoided sharing his opinions, even when I encouraged him. Still, we usually had a great time together, and he even helped me move into my new apartment.

Then things became inconsistent. He works two jobs, but he began canceling or postponing dates. It didn't matter if I suggested places and events. One time, we had a conflict when he walked me through a ""dangerous"" area at night. I panicked because of past trauma (I didn’t explain). He seemed surprised and quiet afterward. The date ended abruptly when he left me at a coffee shop at 8 p.m. due to an “emergency” at his restaurant—which is a 1.5-2 hour drive away and closes at 10 p.m. I felt like he was trying to end things.

He apologized the next day, saying he loved how straightforward I was and how we're like day and night. We hung out again, and while it was good, it felt more like friends. On our last date, we stopped by my apartment, and he asked about the flower bouquet I had on my table (I bought them earlier that day for myself). I joked about needing to feel appreciated, and he kissed me. He tried to take things further, but I refused because I’m not into casual sex. He then insisted I promise never to ghost/block him and to keep dating. He mentioned his insecurities again (clothes), and I didn’t know what to say.

After that, my anxiety spiraled. A lot of things went wrong in my life—job/health issues (including potentially dangerous breast cysts), family drama, and losing my only two friends—and I became clingy. I was texting 15-20 consecutive messages daily. The last 2 days before getting control over myself, I was seeking reassurance that we’d see each other again. He told me to stay calm but vague on when we could meet again. I also didn’t explain why I was so anxious. 

2 weeks later, I mentioned I’d be traveling to my hometown for the holidays. He proposed a date—the same day as my birthday, but I don't know if he remembered—but on that day, he disappeared most of the day. At 4ish pm, he said we could meet if I still wanted to, but he needed to wait for his employee. By 7-8 p.m., he canceled again because his brother was sick and he had to cover at the restaurant.

He asked when I was flying because he wanted to see me before I left. I sent a quick message but broke down crying and deleted it. I was overwhelmed and sensitive. I resent the details later, but he thought I blocked him because the earlier message was gone, and he couldn’t see my profile photo. I told him I needed to talk (I wanted to clarify any misunderstanding), but he replied late at 11pm. By then, I was in so much pain that I took pills to sleep and missed his message. The next morning, I texted him that I wanted to talk, but he didn’t reply.

After a week of silence, I sent a couple of follow-ups, but still nothing.

I feel terrible like I messed up something that could have been good. I'm taking a break from dating because I really like this guy and must focus on my health. But I'd like closure or to know how I could have prevented things from going south, at least.

1hf70hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hf70hz/aitah_for_judging_people/,AITAH for judging people?,"Hey, 20F here. Figuring out life.

I came to the realization lately that I judge people, and I mean, everyone, besides strangers (or at least, I hope so, I'm actively trying to not judge these people).

I don't judge based on appearance. But rather by hobbies that they practice in a frequent manner that can be less healthy and not creative (for example, gaming, watching TV without a purpose, because something like analysis or content creation based on a thing still exists, or going partying simply to get drunk and stay up late)

I'm not saying that you can't do these things once in a while but when you can see/feel that a person is just lacking other skills, not paying attention to other things in life to the point where their sleep schedule is for example getting messed up, yes, then I will judge. Unless you're like trying to be a pro gamer or something, and you're serious and passionate about it. That's a job. Then you're able to provide income which is also important. Then it's 'normal' that you might be less healthy just so you can get extra practice in.

And yes, the world is a mess. That's also a reason why people might seek an escape through arts and media. I know this well myself. I'm currently studying animation film.

I also judge people when they smoke, drink frequently or do drugs (I see medication that has been prescribed to you as something different).

Key word here is frequently for smoking and alcohol. I get the feeling that these people have given up on trying to better their life without those extra things that are damaging to your body.

Really really unhealthy food and drinks is another one, if you do eat or drink that frequently. (I mean, more than 2 times a week here, and big portions. If you're having one scoop of ice cream every night, I'm pretty sure you're fine. Every night an energy drink though, something else. People need to learn to drink black coffee without sugar or milk if they need caffeine.)

I will also judge you based on your accomplishments, but important: when you're not doing well in life and or unhappy, and it's your fault, not something that happened that was out of your control. When you have not accomplished much but you're perfectly happy, you do you.

Lastly, I do judge people who do wrong. Bullies, criminals, ...

And another thought that I'm having is, I feel like the people I'm currently surrounding myself with are just not the people that really motivate me. I really want to be surrounded by people who are clearly doing better than me. And so, I believe that I'm slowly but surely pushing away people who currently are in my life. And I get that they are hurt because of this.

There is this saying that you are the product of the 5 people that you hang out the most with. And I do indeed get influenced by people.

Lastly, I judge myself. A lot. This is something I know I have to work on, but it stems from a place of wanting to improve myself. It's hard to let go. But deep down I know it will be healthier for myself.

The question I have is: how do I go on about this? Do I tell people? Do I need to stop judging? And am I a bad person for this?

I’ll be the vulture

I take them bones and grind them up

Marrow shaped to serve me once again

That I  remade.  
With each morning pour, 
he tastes what is left,  

He drinks from your bones,
His lips to your grave,  
And tastes the memory of what

- Quick customer service when nearby areas were having network issues, etc. 
- Only 5 minutes to set up an account via their app straight from your phone! So no need to visit a branch and take time out of your busy day
- Ability to create multiple ‘savers’ accounts to visualise your money better, and a respectable interest rate on up to five of these (calculated daily and distributed monthly)

They also do ‘Random Acts of Free Coffee’ on weekdays (7am-11am) and ‘Happy Hour’ on Friday (5pm-7pm), where there’s a chance they’ll cover the cost of a food or drink purchase for you!

1hf6pmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/1hf6pmc/academy_of_arcane_axioms_noncombat_magic_for/,Academy Of Arcane Axioms: Non-Combat Magic For Studious Students,"I've noticed that a big preference on this sub is not to deal with combat magic, especially the videogamey kind.

While this post will still involve videogamey magic, it will be in areas that are far less commonly discussed.

While the game I have posted about here is a subset of my overall final project, and that final project contains far more magical systems that are not combat related than this school sim does, the school sim still has quite a bit of non-combat magic, in fact the ""adventure combat"" system and even the ""crafting"" system, are really only intended to be a small part of the game and can even be ignored by players who choose to do so.

People who've played games similar to Academagia or even certain turn based strategy games like Spellforce: Conquest Of Eo or sort of the Illwinter made Dominions series will have some small experience with non-combat magic. But in the case of strategy games it is usually very limited rigid economic enchantments or a few scrying spells or something. Academagia has some spells for buffing skillchecks of various kinds, since it is very visual novel like.

But none of these games have the proper ""meta-information"" foundation or depth of social simulation to make non-combat but also non-economic magic interesting. They can fake it.

The Dominions series has magical spells that do things like reduce the chance of random events. But that is the problem. Events are totally random. There's some scrying magic but mostly it just tells you who owns some land and maybe shows their army. And of course as a wargame it doesn't really have anything social at all. Conquest Of Eo is similar.

You can't really find many fantasy strategy games with more interesting divination. No prophecies, no scrying to determine anything but military deployment. That's because even in something like a fantasy mod for Crusader Kings the NPCs \*don't think\*. They have no \*consciousness\*, no will or personality.

Academagia doesn't have much of that for characters either. Characters might have a high charm stat or maybe they have knowledge of a specific skill. But they don't have \*opinions\* on those skills and you don't \*do\* anything with them except pass skill checks. In rare cases you can minmax spell casting to raise your attributes insanely high or buff a couple skills to the moon for passing a difficult ""adventure skill check"" or score well on a test, but it's not ideal.

But what if spells \*were\* more interactive and \*did\* do more things and the \*foundation was more solid and had more depth\*?

Here we go.

In ""Academy"" each character has a ""Consciousness"", this system is from the larger overall game. Consciousness consists of a Personality, an Ideology, Interests, Desires, And Goals.

Personality is a set of ratings on a spectrum for \~20 beliefs. Being family oriented vs individualist, loyal vs carpicious, brave vs cowardly, etc. Pretty standard stuff in some genres. The difference is the spectrum rather than just being defined as brave, loyal, kind or something as a static ""trait"".

Ideology I'm thinking of ignoring since it makes much more sense in the fantasy world simulation with politics and diplomacy. But it is similar to personality but at a cultural/religious level.

Interests are things like hobbies or activities. Some characters might enjoy philosophy, debate, partying, singing, dancing, drinking, horse related activities, training physical skills, sparring, studying, exploring, playing pranks. All sorts of things. I discussed this in the other post but to summarize, a very important and to me interesting part of a magic school simulation, or fantasy world simulation, is not only that characters feel memorable and distinct despite being procedurally generated but also that the player, and the game systems, \*must interact with that distinctness\*. If you want to learn Divination or Occultism you need to, generally, associate with the people that enjoy and/or are good at it. This extends to professors and other ""adults"" as well as fellow students.

Your character also has a Consciousness, though you have some leeway to form it in character creation. But just the NPCs if you try to subvert your consciousness for your gameplay convenience you'll feel impacts on mental and especially emotional stability. Many games will claim you should ""roleplay"" but the mechanics don't actually support that. That's what some famous game design nerds call ""ludonarrative dissonance"".

Desires are wants that characters have distinct from specific activities. Characters may desire the respect of their peers or parents. They may want to become a specific type of practitioner. They may want to right some past or systemic wrong. Maybe they want to make friends. This is a pretty expansive aspect of ""Consciousness"".

Finally characters, including the player, will have concrete goals. A character who wants to impress their parents may have a father who believes that Ritualism is the most elite magic. Or maybe their father values martial skills or wealth or fame. They'll set a goal to meet those expectations. A student who has a desire to be seen as a great mage or prodigy may set a goal to score at some level on their exams or learn certain spells. A character might have a goal to summon a specific familiar or create a specific piece of equipment.

**Magic In The Mundane**

Why am I talking about all these things that are not directly about magic on the ""magicbuilding"" subreddit? Because. In order to create interesting magical systems and mechanics in a game, the game must simulate the mundane things which that magic complements or synergizes with.

**Consider Divination**

Most strategy or even RPG games don't have interesting or in depth Divination because there is nothing you need to get information about. Divination can do all sorts of things with the foundational character and social simulation. You can ask what students will help you in your goals, or make you happiest as friends. You can divine how to befriend students or teachers. If you want to do shady stuff you could learn the secrets of others and blackmail them. You could divine particular ""Locations"" that have treasures or knowledge or simply are ideal environments to study specific magical knowledge. In Academagia specific locations will provide specific buffs to specific actions or spells or generate ""skill steps"" to raise your skills. That's a very fun and gamey minmaxing mechanic but I wanted to have them be less obviously gamey and provide variety. No going spending all 40 weekly actions in the exact same place every time. Also because of the social system Locations can do much more than raise your skills. Specific locations can be well suited for hanging out with specific people or improving your mental state.

Note that the game has a ""gossip"" system as part of the social interaction. Divination is layered on top of non-magical mechanics to add new avenues, and new risks, to them. You could ask NPCs about each other because they'll all have distinct knowledge about each character based on their own actions. So magic isn't your only option to learn about other students or about teachers.

Performing readings of the stars or tarot to determine auspicious or inauspicious times for specific actions, either through magical influence of simply divining that some unrelated situation would interfere.

**Library And Study Knowledge**

You could actually deal with normal Divination here too, to some degree. Asking what Library has books you need and then qualifying to study there or sneaking in.

There are various book/library specific spells as well as memory and study aid spells. Some libraries may lack catalogues altogether and thus require students to be skilled in Communion and ""feel"" their way to the right shelf.

Again there are mundane ways to gain crucial knowledge. Various Perception and ""School Survival"" related skills will help you discover important information about how to succeed and various social skills can also help. Joining school clubs or secret societies, know students with older relatives who attended a school, other stuff like that.

**Exploration Magic**

Another area where non-combat magic comes into play is travel, exploring, and avoiding pranks or bullying. There are mundane skills related to pathfinding, navigation, zoology and botany but you can also engage magically with these gameplay elements. There's also the ability to detect ""enemies"" coming or hide yourself in various ways. Sure-Step could help you scrabbling up a rockfall or through the woods with branches on the ground or dealing with ice and mud. Note that ""Academy"" is a ""Map & Menu"" game and doesn't have, outside of special limited circumstances, any walking around or character avatars. So generally magical preparation or spontaneous action revolves around the traits of a location you are in or deals with skill checks combining to reach an outcome.

**Organization And Time Management**

Obviously one of the most important parts of dealing with education is juggling social and school and family and financial issues. Spells to remove or postpone fatigue, spells of focus, spells to modify your environment like temperature control or blocking wind/rain, summoning water or coffee, and so on. Alchemy, which doesn't use in the moment spells can also impact similar things. Additionally as always there are mundane skills you can train. Fitness for instance. Running fast back and forth between locations to get things you need or forgot. Etc.

**Social Interaction**

This is a pretty broad area. You could cast mood altering or confidence spells on yourself or others, with or without their knowledge, and with positive or negative effects. Giving yourself unnatural luck or charm or insight could allow you to buffer weaknesses or boost strengths. Causing opponents to trip or lose things, create water that spills on them and so on. All the pranks that school environments are known for. You may be a hero or a villain, pranks are simply tools.

**Invocation**

Performing favors for spirits or engaging them in various other ways to build your contract or bond for a later payoff. Non-mortal entities have desires and interests just as humans do. Perhaps allowing a spirit to dance in a snowstorm or fulfill some other weird request they have.

**Demonology/Occultism**

These schools often have little direct combat application, primarily contributing through boons or buffs from rituals or bindings.

You'll often spend time learning rituals or gathering materials for them and then performing them in quiet rooms or secret caverns.

**Crafting**

This doesn't really involve crafting spells per say but obviously brewing potions or forging gear is mostly done out of combat.

**Chores/Services/Detention**

You may choose to perform various everyday magic for your own reasons or for remuneration. You might also be assiged chores or tasks due to being in detention. Having the right tools to finish detention quickly and in cases where your time may be loaned out to non-school authorities pleasing your ""employer"" are very useful applications of magic in my mind. Washing things, shaping earth, carrying things around after self-strengthening or casting feather weight. All useful applications of magic to save time and energy.

**Illusion And Shady Dealings**

Illusion magic is the most obvious area for engaging in shady business. But Divination and some other spheres of magic can also be useful. Distracting prefects, guards, teachers, other students and so on with flashes of light or the sounds of objects hitting the ground. Hiding yourself, another, objects, even doorways and so on with camoflague or direct illusion. Truth telling spells or lie telling spells, and so on. Again there are mundane tools to boost success at social challenges but magic provides another option or a complement.

Illusions can also be used for more positive things. Entertainment using Illusion for money or helping teachers with school festivities or amusing your friends in various ways. Delighting children, or spirits as mentioned earlier.

**Thesis**

The reason almost every magic system is combat focused in games, and in stories that are based off games and written by someone who games more than they read, is because combat systems are intricate and detailed with lots of moving parts and data you can modify with a ""spell"" but even in rpgs or city builders or adventure games the level of detail for non-combat activities is not that deep. CK3 for instance is supposedly a character interaction game but actually character interaction is very simplistic and characters are basically stateblocks with like 4 variables that aren't combat or economy related. There are great fantasy modes for gsg games like Anbennar and Godherja, but even GoT mods barely have any politics.",4,1734309063.0,magicbuilding,0,1.0,False

Her response ""I think we are better as friends""

We see eachother everyday in work and I act as normal as possible... hiding all those emotions.

I recently discovered what occipital neuralgia is and it has made me question if that’s what I’ve been dealing with on and off for a few years.

It seems to occur on mornings where I skip my regular morning coffee, or after a bad flu, or after I’ve been tensing my neck muscles or slept awkwardly.

My symptoms are always at the back of my head where my skull meets my neck, right around the two bones that slightly protrude. It’s extremely tender to touch back there and feels like a bad bruise. It’s almost always worse on the right side as well. It gives me an overall headache that stems from the back of my head and worsens when I cough, laugh, or run. It does not feel like sharp stabbing pain like google mentions though, for me it feels more like a dull and throbbing/pulsating pain, almost like a sinus headache if that makes sense. Sometimes it lasts for days.

Right now I’m on day 3, and I believe it was triggered by my constant studying for finals this past week and sitting in awkward positions to work on my laptop. My neck muscles were definitely strained from studying so I’m wondering if that could have flared this?

The worst part is definitely the super tender area at the back of my head that hurts to touch and the radiating/throbbing headache. Do my symptoms sound like occipital neuralgia? ",2,1734308573.0,Occipitalneuralgia,1,1.0,False

I think maybe she is jealous of me because of my looks? I don't want to sound vain but I've been told I look like Sydney Sweeney. My sister looks like Jenna Ortega.

\-------------------------------

Alright, I'm very sorry about that. I had to post something eye-catching to get your attention.

I am making this post to spread awareness of the *actual* 3 page manifesto of ""CEO UnitedHealthcare killer"" Luigi Mangione.

Yes, he was insured by them. The media is lying to us. Any time I make a post about it, the post gets removed and I get banned.

I have uploaded the originals here [https://ibb.co/album/nzTgx4](https://ibb.co/album/nzTgx4) that you can read for yourself. It was originally posted on Substack, but has since been removed.

If you do not trust links, then I have extracted the text. Here is the full 3 page manifesto that he posted on the day he was arrested:

Title: The Allopathic Complex and Its Consequences

""The second amendment means I am my own chief executive and commander in chief of my own military. I authorize my own act of self-defense in response to a hostile entity making war on me and my family.

Nelson Mandela says no form of violence can be excused. Camus says it's all the same, whether you live or die or have a cup of coffee. MLK says violence never brings permanent peace. Gandhi says that non-violence is the mightiest power available to mankind.

That's who they tell you are heroes. That's who our revolutionaries are.

Yet is that not capitalistic? Non-violence keeps the system working at full speed ahead.

What did it get us. Look in the mirror.

They want us to be non-violent, so that they can grow fat off the blood they take from us.

The only way out is through. Not all of us will make it. Each of us is our own chief executive. You have to decide what you will tolerate.

In Gladiator 1 Maximus cuts into the military tattoo that identifies him as part of the roman legion. His friend asks ""Is that the sign of your god?"" As Maximus carves deeper into his own flesh, as his own blood drips down his skin, Maximus smiles and nods yes. The tattoo represents the emperor, who is god. The god emperor has made himself part of Maximus's own flesh. The only way to destroy the emperor is to destroy himself. Maximus smiles through the pain because he knows it is worth it.

These might be my last words. I don't know when they will come for me. I will resist them at any cost. That's why I smile through the pain.

They diagnosed my mother with severe neuropathy when she was forty-one years old. She said it started ten years before that with burning sensations in her feet and occasional sharp stabbing pains. At first the pain would last a few moments, then fade to tingling, then numbness, then fade to nothing a few days later.

The first time the pain came she ignored it. Then it came a couple times a year and she ignored it. Then every couple months. Then a couple times a month. Then a couple times a week. At that point by the time the tingling faded to numbness, the pain would start, and the discomfort was constant. At that point even going from the couch to the kitchen to make her own lunch became a major endeavor

She started with ibuprofen, until the stomach aches and acid reflux made her switch to acetaminophen. Then the headaches and barely sleeping made her switch back to ibuprofen.

The first doctor said it was psychosomatic. Nothing was wrong. She needed to relax, destress, sleep more.

The second doctor said it was a compressed nerve in her spine. She needed back surgery. It would cost $180,000. Recovery would be six months minimum before walking again. Twelve months for full potential recovery, and she would never lift more than ten pounds of weight again.

The third doctor performed a Nerve Conduction Study, Electromyography, MRI, and blood tests. Each test cost $800 to $1200. She hit the $6000 deductible of her UnitedHealthcare plan in October. Then the doctor went on vacation, and my mother wasn't able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset.

The tests showed severe neuropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have had no effect.

They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn't tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years, when she drove me to Monterey to go to the aquarium. I saw an otter in real life, swimming on its back. We left at 7am and listened to Green Day on the four-hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her MORE sensitive to pain, and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two or three hours.

Then gabapentin. By now the pain was so bad she couldn't exercise, which compounded the weight gain from the slowed metabolic rate and hormonal shifts. And it barely helped the pain, and made her so fatigued she would go an entire day without getting out of bed.

Then Corticosteroids. Which didn't even work.

The pain was so bad I would hear my mother wake up in the night screaming in pain. I would run into her room, asking if she's OK. Eventually I stopped getting up. She'd yell out anguished shrieks of wordless pain or the word ""fuck"" stretched and distended to its limits. I'd turn over and go back to sleep.

All of this while they bled us dry with follow-up appointment after follow-up appointment, specialist consultations, and more imagine scans. Each appointment was promised to be fully covered, until the insurance claims were delayed and denied. Allopathic medicine did nothing to help my mother's suffering. Yet it is the foundation of our entire society.

My mother told me that on a good day the nerve pain was like her legs were immersed in ice water. On a bad day it felt like her legs were clamped in a machine shop vice, screwed down to where the cranks stopped turning, then crushed further until her ankle bones sprintered and cracked to accommodate the tightening clamp. She had more bad days than good.

My mother crawled to the bathroom on her hands and knees. I slept in the living room to create more distance from her cries in the night. I still woke up, and still went back to sleep.

Back then I thought there was nothing I could do.

The high copays made consistent treatment impossible. New treatments were denied as ""not medically necessary."" Old treatments didn't work, and still put us out for thousands of dollars.

United Healthcare limited specialist consultations to twice a year.

Then they refused to cover advanced imaging, which the specialists required for an appointment.

Prior authorizations took weeks, then months.

UnitedHealthcare constantly changed their claim filing procedure. They said my mother's doctor needed to fax his notes. Then UnitedHealthcare said they did not save faxed patient correspondence, and required a hardcopy of the doctor's typed notes to be mailed. Then they said they never received the notes. They were unable to approve the claim until they had received and filed the notes.

They promised coverage, and broke their word to my mother.

With every delay, my anger surged. With every denial, I wanted to throw the doctor through the glass wall of their hospital waiting room.

But it wasn't them. It wasn't the doctors, the receptionists, administrators, pharmacists, imaging technicians, or anyone we ever met. It was UnitedHealthcare.

People are dying. Evil has become institutionalized. Corporations make billions of dollars off the pain, suffering, death, and anguished cries in the night of millions of Americans.

We entered into an agreement for healthcare with a legally binding contract that promised care commensurate with our insurance payments and medical needs. Then UnitedHealthcare changes the rules to suit their own profits. They think they make the rules, and think that because it's legal that no one can punish them.

They think there's no one out there who will stop them.

Now my own chronic back pain wakes me in the night, screaming in pain. I sought out another type of healing that showed me the real antidote to what ails us.

I bide my time, saving the last of my strength to strike my final blows. All extractors must be forced to swallow the bitter pain they deal out to millions.  
As our own chief executives, it's our obligation to make our own lives better. First and foremost, we must seek to improve our own circumstances and defend ourselves. As we do so, our actions have ripple effects that can improve the lives of others.

Rules exist between two individuals, in a network that covers the entire earth. Some of these rules are written down. Some of these rules emerge from natural respect between two individuals. Some of these rules are defined in physical laws. like the properties of gravity, magnetism or the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of potassium nitrate.

No single document better encapsulates the belief that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status and the frameworks for fostering collective well-being than the US constitution.

Writing a rule down makes it into a law. I don't give a fuck about the law. Law means nothing. What does matter is following the guidance of our own logic and what we learn from those before us to maximize our own well-being, which will then maximize the well-being of our loved ones and community.

That's where UnitedHealthcare went wrong. They violated their contract with my mother, with me, and tens of millions of other Americans. This threat to my own health, my family's health, and the health of our country's people requires me to respond with an act of war.

1hf6h3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hf6h3q/nf_a_plain_morning_my_recollection_of/,[NF] A Plain Morning - my recollection of interactions at a Christmas Party ,"A Plain Morning

Waking up. Feeling the sun slowly make its way closer and closer to my eyes through the crack in the window. A minute later each day as we head into the peak of winter. Six more days until the shortest day of the year. I don’t mind the long days. Winter brings a nostalgic melancholia, the kind needed to change and adapt.

Some days, I miss the warm summer and the ability to bask in the heat of the western sun. A god that rises early and sets late, I crave its warmth. But winter serves its purpose as the great reset. I constantly hope for snow to come and wash away the dirt, clearing the way for new leaves to emerge in spring.

Waking up cold is nicer than waking up warm, and hot coffee tastes better when it’s cold outside.

The Christmas Party

Last night, I went to a friend’s Christmas party. It feels less and less like Christmas the closer it gets. We arrived around 8, a group younger than me, still full of life, seemingly unscarred by the pain of growing up.

In a quiet moment, Max shared the last time he cried. All my interactions with him had shown a man putting on a front, hiding behind a mask of masculinity. His voice was low, almost embarrassed.

“The last time I cried was when my pug, Boo, died. She passed two weeks after I saw her. I was leaving Hawaii to move to Texas. I wish I’d spent more time with her. You always think there’s more time than there really is.”

Max looked down, his voice cracking. I lifted my beer. “To Boo.” For once, the room fell silent. No one laughed or talked over each other. We all held our glasses, united in the weight of loss.

The hard thing about being human is how we show vulnerability. How, sometimes, it feels like weakness. But vulnerability is a strength. It’s okay to cry.

After the toast, the mood softened. Simon, a car salesman with tattoos down his arms and piercings on his face, joined the conversation. He was funny, likable—seemed genuine.

“It’s a cutthroat business,” he said, rolling up his sleeves. “You have to be sharp, maybe a little scary to close deals. People see me and think I don’t belong. That’s half the fun, though. Closing a deal feels like winning.”

Simon can sell a ’99 Corolla to a Mormon family man, I thought, smiling to myself.

I thought about how, a few days ago, I’d been in Las Vegas for work, meeting with customers. I’d taken my nose ring out before the meeting. It wasn’t that I was ashamed of it, but I feared the judgment. I imagined the whispers: “He’s unprofessional,” “Why would we trust him?”

When I told my manager I’d taken it out, he laughed. “You don’t need to do that. You’re a professional and damn good at what you do.”

I felt silly for worrying about it. I wish I didn’t care what others thought—but I do. Maybe we all do, even when we pretend we don’t.

Later, the White Elephant exchange began. A guy named Michael brought an iridescent shark catfish as one of the gifts. The shark was captive in a Tupperware container, holes poked in the lid. I remember seeing Michael walk around with his gift before the reveal, swinging it like a joke. A girl named Jackie was the one who chose it. She opened it with excitement and immediately started looking for bigger tanks to house the fish.

I thought the gift was strange, so I later asked Michael about it.

“What were you going to do about the fish if it went to someone who didn’t want it?”

Swirling the drink in his glass, he looked at me and laughed. “Let it die, I guess. I wouldn’t want it back.”

He said this like it was nothing—just another joke at a party. I stared at him, waiting for him to continue, but he never did. The Tupperware sat on the table in front of us, the fish circling its little puddle of water, watching us. Gods debating its fate. I wondered if it knew how close it had come to being forgotten, starving to death in the corner of a stranger’s house.

It unsettled me, how little thought he gave it. It was a disturbing thought.

In the end, I think Jackie was the right person to choose the fish. Her excitement at getting it, hoping no one would steal it during the White Elephant festivities, was nice to see. If I ever see Jackie again, I’ll ask about the fish, which she named “Little Mike.”

The rest of the White Elephant exchanges went well, and I think everybody had a fun time. It was nice to see everyone excited to get gifts and steal them from others.

Once the exchange ended, the drinking games began. I decided to sit out, feeling like an outsider—I’ve always preferred quieter, more meaningful moments. My roommate, and ride to the party, Ben, was the one who initiated the games. He also was clearly in no state to drive. I started feeling more disconnected from the night and retreated to a spot on the couch, an observer.

It was striking, just how quickly we move from connection to disconnection—from toasts to someone’s deceased dog, to shallow interactions playing a drinking game. I called an Uber. I’ve never felt comfortable around drunk people, anyway.

This morning, my head was full of these fleeting interactions. I wondered if anyone would remember them, or if they’d just vanish into the blur of time. The sunlight bled through the blinds, steady and familiar. I got up and looked at myself in the mirror. I stared at my face, clean-shaven for the first time in years, save for the mustache. I glanced at my nose ring, small and gold, and thought about how hard it was to put it back in after I’d taken it out earlier this week. It felt like another form of masking, like trying to reconcile who I was with who I thought I should be.

I went upstairs to brew some coffee. The day stretched out before me. It was a plain morning.",1,1734308361.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Give us your thoughts! ,"Was wanting to get everyone's thoughts on where they got their beans from and what they discovered.  Maybe you found a new favourite decaf style?

  
I'll start - I bought mine from Sample Coffee -  a really well known and high quality roaster from Sydney Australia whom I've bought from many times. 

I decided to do my own cupping/tasting session before the livestream as I was impatient. I won't go into too much detail as I didn't take notes but overall I found:

**Unprocessed -** super clean with nice body. High sweetness and reminiscent of white peaches and white grapes. I'm not usually the biggest fan of washed Colombians as I find them a little boring, but this was enjoyable. Developed more sweetness and complexity after about 10 minutes which was interesting. Overall I really enjoyed this and it has swayed me to try more washed beans. 

**Swiss Water -** Immediate drop in quality. Loss of sweetness and fruitiness. Maybe retained some of the texture, but overall I wasn't a fan. Felt like I was drinking the ""idea of coffee"".  

**Ethyl Acetate -** Similar to the Swiss Water, with maybe a bit more sweetness. More tea-like and had a nice mouth-feel, but the relatively sharp loss in flavour ruled it out for me as being a like. I do recognise the potential though maybe with other beans/processes.  

**Carbonic** \- WOW! Is it possible for decaf to become sweeter than the unprocessed beans?? Because it was a sugar bomb! Wonderful sweetness, still retained the fruitiness, albeit maybe bordering on candied fruit now. Little bit more tea-like in body, but I kinda liked that. Actually tasted better than the OG for the first 10 minutes which is usually when I would have finished my coffee.

But I've been recruited.,"It was Christmas Eve when I was released from the WYPA (Youth With Psychic Abilities) institute.

I was playing cards with Ethan, a pyrokinetic and a sore loser.

That asshole kept burning the cards to ashes every time I won. 

Ethan, designated as category red, was the closest thing I had to a friend. 

He was a big dude with a surprisingly bigger heart; an ex-high school jock who had become my roomie two years prior. 

I could tell he’d been popular—probably from an affluent family—so he likely wasn’t staying long. 

They brought him in one night, kicking and screaming, and strapped him to the bed opposite mine.

For the first few weeks, Ethan wasn’t allowed to use his hands. 

He sat cross-legged on his bed and told me how he’d set his entire town alight. 

Sitting in the cremated remnants of his letterman jacket, with his thick brown hair and freckles, he looked like the textbook boy-next-door. I thought he’d be harder to talk to, but he was oddly talkative. At first, I thought it was the drugs they force-fed him, but then he became obsessed with telling me his life story.

And with telling me how he’d accidentally burnt his girlfriend’s eyes out, which somehow led to him attempting to torch his entire town? I know, I told him it was extra. 

Ethan insisted it wasn’t his fault, that there was a “voice” inside his head telling him to do it, but I already knew I was talking to a category red—and that was before they even brought in his collar, which mediated his emotions, and was as dehumanising as you would think. 

I admit, I was initially pretty fucking scared of the guy. 

—

It’s not exactly brainwashing, but the moment we’re brought into the institute and categorized as lower levels (blue, indigo, and violet), we’re taught to steer clear of kids categorized at higher levels. 

Those are the ones who need to be muzzled and collared: pyros like Ethan and kids like Carlisle, the girl in the room next to mine. 

Carlisle was a Speaker, capable of bringing her own words to life, and super powerful for all of her 17 years on earth. 

She told her guard he was suffering from a brain hemorrhage, and seconds later, he was. Carlisle wasn’t just being held at the WYPA because of her ability. She was being protected from world leaders and other ne'er-do-wells who could easily use her for their own personal gain. 

Kids like Carlisle and Ethan were the lost causes. Here one minute, gone the next. 

I half-expected Ethan to disappear one day while I was being tested on, or forcing down mystery meat that passed as cafeteria food.

But it had been almost two years, and pyro boy was still my roommate.

I was category blue, a high-level telekinetic, so it’s not like we could relate to each other. 

Ethan was more likely to be executed at eighteen due to the severity of his case.

But weirdly enough, I enjoyed his company.

Just like school, the WYPA had a social hierarchy. Blues, who were most likely to be recruited for some shady government program, were at the top. JJ Walker and Alex Simons, lower-level blues, had already invited me to join their little gang, but I wasn’t interested in their weird obsession with becoming soldiers. 

I’d been brought in at twelve: those kids had been at the WYPA since birth, never seeing sunlight and being subtly conditioned to enjoy the idea of becoming mindless drones for some higher power.

Those types of kids were noticeably more feral and animal-like, baring their teeth when guards grabbed them for daily testing. JJ was already giving me cult-leader vibes. Instead of being scared of his ability, he embraced it. 

Meanwhile, I had a feeling the mandatory Friday classes for low-level blues were screwing with their brains—maybe even prepping them for recruitment. Luckily, I was able to avoid it.

It wasn't easy at first. But the second I was dragged into a classroom-like setting, with an ancient analogue television at the front, I knew my fate. It was part of being recruited, after all. 

People in the real world weren’t interested in noncompliant telekinetics. 

They wanted brainless shells. 

There was only one way of getting out of mandatory classes, which were either life lessons for the rare occasion that you would be released, or plain fucking brainwashing. I had no choice but to play the unhinged card—which was risky and could either end with me getting executed or sent to therapy.

So in the cafeteria, I staged a breakdown, pinning several kids to the ceiling. I was taken down almost immediately, of course, and thankfully, instead of “military training” in my schedule, I had “Psychokinetic Therapy.” 

So, instead of being subjected to what I could only guess was some seriously messed up shit (judging by the rapid decline in the blue’s humanity), I sat in a room with my personal therapist, who taught me how to manage my power and not abuse it.

Speaking of the other blues, they started being more annoying than usual, sitting at their usual table embedded in a game of silent chess. Which was chess, but nobody talked, and each member used their ability instead of their hands. 

This kind of information has been nailed into my brain since my imprisonment since the WYPA, so I know the nitty gritty of the category blue. 

When you're categorised as blue, you can either be a low level or a high level. 

Low levels can do simple telekinesis, which is moving or controlling an object or organic matter with their mind. 

High levels, however, can extend their ability to the brain. 

That's one of the reasons why blues are so popular in recruitment. 

Whereas low levels are wanted for their simple ability to move objects, high levels are in demand for their ability to control minds, like influencing or erasing memories, and in some cases, managing a complete take-over of the original organic personality. As a high level, I knew my day was coming sooner or later. 

I couldn't fully master what we called 
Influence yet, but I did successfully manage to push my instructor to punch me in the face, and then erase his memory of performing that action. 

Which meant I was extremely close to being recategorized at a higher level. 

It was Saturday night, which was a free day. Nepo babies were allowed monitored time with their parents, while the rest of us had to keep up appearances in front of the elites, pretending we were having the best time ever and definitely weren’t being abused and tested on. 

I mean, if these people were as perceptive as they thought, they’d notice the blood stains. Right?

The Velcro straps on every bed. The execution room, which was just one big industrial furnace.

Every time a kid was burned alive, the WYPA played Taylor Swift at full volume.

When I was thirteen, I was being dragged back to my room in cuffs after standardized testing. I remember the right side of my body was numb and my nose was bleeding, beads of warm red dripping down my chin. It itched as it dried, but I couldn't do much about it. 

The drugs were already destabilizing my limbs, making it impossible to run, my vision swimming in and out of focus. All I could see were clinical white walls crashing into me like ocean waves.

I wasn’t expecting to hear Taylor Swift. I can’t remember what song it was, just the same lyrics repeating as I was dragged down the hallway toward a bright orange blur.

You found me, 

You found me,

You found me-e-e-e.

“Move,” my guard ordered, shoving me forward. 

That song followed me all the way back to my room. 

When I was freed from my cuffs and shoved inside, I layed down and pretended I couldn't hear the agonizing screams from adjacent cells slicing through those lyrics. I had pretty much accepted my fate as either ending up in there, being fucking barbecued to an upbeat pop song, or joining my fellow blues as a military drone. 

I didn't even fucking dream of walking out of the WYPA on my own two feet. 

With my mind intact, at least.

Christmas in the WYPA was about as fun as you would expect. There was a single Christmas tree themed sticker on the wall for a “decoration.” 

But I wasn't even sure if some kids even knew what Christmas was. Jessa Harley, who was executed three days after her arrival, asked JJ if he wanted to do a secret Santa, and the boy looked at her like she'd grown a second head. Jessa was another scary one, a category white. 

Her ability was similar to a Speaker, but on a mass scale. So, you can imagine how fucking terrifying she was. 

But she didn't look scary, she looked harmless! Jessa was tiny with orange pigtails and a gentle smile.

As cute and innocent as she looked though, Jessa could obliterate our universe if she wanted to. She could also prevent war if she wanted to. The rumor mill churned, and I heard from an Indigo, that Jessa had snapped her own family out of existence. 

But Jessa used her power for small things. She wanted a puppy, and bam, there was one in her lap. 

She wanted a swimming pool, and suddenly, a whole new indoor pool hall just appeared at the end of the first floor. She was both a miracle and a curse, and I don't think the WYPA trusted her– and others were out there hunting her down. 

Jessa was only there for three days, but had left an impression. 

The swimming pool, for example. It's not like we could use it, but it was still there. 

The white plastic seat where she'd sat cross-legged, eagerly asking people's names, sat sadly empty. 

—

I was losing patience with Ethan, who thought burning my cards would make him a winner. 

The worst part is, he was actually making me laugh, shooting me a grin every time my Queen burst into flames. It was funny the first few times, but was getting progressively less entertaining. I found myself smiling through gritted teeth just as the large metal door flew open, making me jump. Ethan flinched, his gaze glued to his deck of cards. 

He was about to turn the big one eight, which meant his evaluation was soon.

Execution, or, if they were feeling merciful, maybe a re-sentencing until he was twenty five.

I kicked him under the table when he didn't lay down his cards. 

Ethan kicked me back, his eyes growing frenzied. 

“Fuck.” He whispered, his gaze dropping to the table. “I bet they've come for me.”

I kicked him again, this time reassuringly. “You're still seventeen, dumbass.”

“Yeah, but not for long.”

I raised a brow. “Why would they kill you at seventeen?”

“Because they're fucking assholes.”

Leaning across the shitty fold out table, I fixed him with a smile. “What if you're fire-proof?”

“All right, listen up!”

The voice snapped me out of it. Twisting around, Warden Carrington stood in the doorway, twirling a pair of metal cuffs. 

She was a stiff, narrow bodied woman with a blonde top-knot and a permanent grin. She took pleasure in escorting kids to be executed. Bile crept up my throat. 

Is that what this was? No, executions were usually private. 

Tests, maybe? 

I was used to mandatory ones every Friday. That's what the cuffs were usually for. We were taken from the rec room individually, cuffed, and dragged to the testing rooms. But it wasn’t Friday. And the floors were too clean. I was used to blood seeping across the floor on a testing day. 

I wasn't allowed to look the warden in the eye as a Blue, but I managed a risqué glance. She was smiling suggestively, so it had to be an execution. Realization crept in then, that the slight curl on her lip suggested exactly the opposite. 

Recruitment.

I scanned the room.  Fifteen fearful faces staring at her.  A willowy blonde who had previously been reading a dog eared paperback, was now sitting up straight, her half-lidded eyes wide, almost awake. She caught my gaze, lips pricking into a smile. 

Slowly, the girl inclined her head, a single blonde curl falling into her eyes. She ran her index finger across her throat, mouthing, “We’re fucked.”

Could it be Matthews? 

My gaze flicked to the brunette curled up in the corner of the room. Carlisle? I used to talk to her. We were from the same town, so we had that mutual connection. 

But something happened to her after a testing session, and since then, Carlisle shut everyone else out and isolated herself. 

Matthews was immortal, and Carlisle had the power to end the world. 

I doubted either of them were being recruited.

Unless world leaders needed Carlisle, which wasn't entirely out of the realm of possibility. 

“The holidays came early, kids!” Warden Carrington mocked, and I sensed the group of us all holding a collective breath. 

“Johnson!” she boomed. “You’re getting out of here!”

There was an awkward silence before Ethan kicked me. 

“Bro, that's you!”

He was right. Slowly, I got to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest. I was Johnson. Which was crazy, because the only kids who made it out of the WYPA alive were either nepo babies or… 

My excitement started to wither once I'd hugged Ethan a quick goodbye, and offered Carlisle a sympathetic smile. 

I thought, just for a moment, that maybe my Mom had come to get me– finally, after five years. But my mother was dead. 

I watched a man who called himself Mr. Yellow blow her brains out with a smile, before kneeling in front of me. 

I was standing in my mother’s blood, watching slow-spreading crimson seeping across her favorite rug.  

“Hey, there, little boy,” he said, his eyes maniacal, grin widening. “Do you want to come to a super special place?”

The ‘super special’ place was obviously the WYPA.

I didn't even get to fucking mourn my mother. 

And to everyone in the outside world, twelve year old Johnson had murdered his Mom. 

There were only three ways to get out of WYPA: in a body bag, or the other way—the one I dreaded.

Warden Carrington was smiling with way too many teeth when I slowly made my way over to her. She grabbed my arms, linking them behind my back and cuffing me. 

“You’ve been… recruited!”

I was dragged out the door and down the hallway. 

At the end, surprisingly, stood a guy my age. He was tall, a pair of raybans pinning back dark blonde hair, wearing a long trench coat that hung off his slim frame.

In his hand was a small paper bag he was swinging excitedly. 

The closer I was getting, being unceremoniously pushed forward by the warden, the guy’s swinging became more and more eager. I was convinced he was going to accidentally fling the bag in my face. I wasn't expecting to be recruited by a teenager resembling a CW Sherlock Holmes.

“Hi!” He greeted me, genuinely excited to see me. The boy motioned for the warden to uncuff me, and she did, making sure to keep hold of my arms, her bony fingers pricking into my flesh. “It's great to finally see you in person! I’ve been trying to get you out of here for weeks! But there's so much paperwork, and blah, blah, blah, it was a whole mess,” he rolled his eyes. 

“But here you are!” His southern accent was already irritating. He grabbed my shoulders with teary eyes like I was a stray fucking cat he had just adopted. 

“You're Johnson, right? I'm Nathan!” he held out the bag, and I caught the unmistakable smell of fried food. “Do you want Five Guys?”

Warden Carrington cleared her throat. “Not in here,” she drawled, “The smell will wake up Will.”

Will was a higher level category yellow (a shifter). But I fully understood why. 

Werewolf. 

Apparently, he'd been sacrificed to the moon during his frat’s hazing ritual, gaining the ability to shift his flesh to a dog-like beast. As well as adapting a liking for human flesh. There were two incidents with Will, and both of them ended in him cannibalizing at least three inmates. 

Nathaniel looked intrigued, but he kept his mouth shut. I was handed a fresh set of clothes to change into, before being shoved through the main doors. 

I couldn't believe I was actually breathing in real, ice-cold air.

I could feel it tickling my cheeks, blowing my hair out of my eyes.

In the real world, I stuck out like an anomaly in my clinical white shorts and tee.

I was standing on concrete, uneven and gritty beneath my shitty Converse. 

Twisting around, I stared up at the WYPA—a looming glass building. 

We were in the middle of nowhere. I hadn’t noticed on my way into WYPA because I was blindfolded. Nathanial pointed across the parking lot. There was only one car, and it was his: an expensive, sleek-looking Range Rover. 

I tried to jump into the back, but he patted the passenger seat. 

Nathanial slid into the driver's side. “So, there are, like, actual werewolves in that place?”

I shot him a look, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. I didn’t know why he was fascinated with werewolves when there were kids in there who could snap us out of existence if they were slightly annoyed. 

Slipping onto the warm leather seats, my muscles started to relax. I was so used to the harsh, shitty plastic chairs in the WYPA rec room.

And then there were the blood-stained metal gurneys I had to sit on during testing.

But this—this was an actual *seat.* I had missed cars. I’d missed being able to sink into cushions.

To relax.

Nathanial started the car, cranking up the radio.

Taylor Swift.

Not just Taylor Swift, but that exact same fucking song.

He shot me a grin, reaching into the back and grabbing a bag of Five Guys.

“Hungry?”

I was.

I ate the burger in two bites and almost choked on the soda.

“Dude,” Nathanial chuckled, side-eyeing me. “The food isn’t going to run away.”

Asshole.

I started inhaling the fries, ignoring his little jab.

“I can understand, though. Of course you’re fucking hungry,” Nathanial said, his gaze flicking to the road ahead. 

I couldn’t resist pressing my head against the window, slurping my Coke. 

The vivid red and orange blur of traffic flying past was making me carsick. 

“I know what goes on inside that place, and the inhumane shit they do to kids like you makes me enraged.”

“Kids like me.” I stopped chugging, a sour bite to my tone.

He sighed. “You know that's not what I meant.”

“Sounded like it.”

I caught his expression darken significantly, his fingers tightening around the wheel.

“I’m sorry, Johnson,” he said, his tone cracking slightly. “For what those fucks did to you. I fought to get you out of that place.” he scoffed. “They kept trying to shove another kid in my face, but I told them it was either you, or I was out.”

“Why me?” I didn't turn around to look at him, my gaze stuck to blurry holiday lights flying past us. 

They were too bright in contrast to the darkening sky. 

Nathanial didn't respond, cranking up the radio. 

I wasn't buying this guy’s friendly act. I had a hard time believing his ‘save the children’ bullshit.  “So, what do you need me for?” I asked, making myself comfy. “Construction? Did your cat get stuck up a tree?”

“Nope.” His lips curled into a smirk. “Do you know what day it is?”

“Easter.” I deadpanned, and he let out a hyena laugh. 

I admit, I was taken off guard when he drove me to the airport. Nathanial threw his jacket over my shoulders, looking me up and down. “All right, you're good,” he ruffled my hair. “Luckily for you, kids our age literally wear anything. So, yes, you may look like you've been institutionalised, but my coat gives you a hipster vibe, y’know?”

I had no idea what he was talking about. He sounded like an Animal Crossing character. 

“I don't have an ID,” I managed to hiss out when he pulled me into the airport. It was surprisingly quiet for Christmas Eve. 

I expected to be questioned about my lack of passport and identity,  but Nathaniel, despite his age and lack of maturity, could easily pull me right through security with a flash of his badge. 

He gestured to a nearby coffee store, handing over way too many bills for a drink. 

“Flat white, and a bottle of water,” he said hurriedly, swiping through his phone. “Feel free to go crazy. Get as much as you want.”

I had almost 500 dollars pressed into my palm. 

So, yes, I went crazy. 

I almost turned and ran, taking the cash with me. 

But my Mom was dead. There was no home to go back to. 

I bought a double chocolate brownie hot cocoa to go, and turkey and stuffing sub, devouring both of them before I even left the store. Nathanial was waiting for me. 

He sipped his flag-white, leading me straight past the gate. When a guard stepped in front of us, he shot them a smile. “It's cool, we’re exceptions,” he said. 

The guard paused before nodding and stepping aside. 

“Have a good flight,  boys,” his lips broke out into a grin, “Oh, and happy holidays!”

Nathaniel winked at the man, smirking. “You too, Bobby!”

I was expecting first class seats, but instead, I was ushered onto a private jet. 

So, Nathanial was riiiiiich, rich. I had a bed as a seat. 

I slept for most of the flight, dreaming I was back in the WYPA, back on my blood stained mattress counting ceiling tiles. 

“So, how is it?”

Ethan loomed over me with his arms folded. The startling white of his shorts and tee made my eyes hurt. 

I didn't blink, stretching out my stiff legs. His voice was kind of muffled. 

“It's okay, I guess,” I said, “I had Five Guys.”

Ethan pulled a face, tipping his head back. 

“Ugh. Don't. I’m pretty sure they gave us recycled slop for dinner.”

I rolled onto my side. “Was it the chef's special macaroni and cheese?”

“Yep.” Ethan curled his lip. “They're trying to fucking kill us with the food.”

I nodded, enjoying my ex roommate’s company. Though I wasn't sure why he was pacing up and down. “The second I’ve built up this guy’s trust, I’ll get you guys out of there.”

I felt my heart squeeze, and I swallowed sour tasting puke. “Before you turn eighteen. I'll get you the fuck out of there.”

Ethan frowned, leaning closer, his brows furrowed like bugs. 

I blinked rapidly. 

Like tiny wiggling little furry bugs. 

“Dude.” I was pretty sure there weren't supposed to be two Ethan’s. The two Ethans leaned forward. “Can't you smell that?”

I could. 

It was potent, like bleach, suffocating my throat. 

Ethan jerked back, his eyes were wide. “That smells like–”

Reality slammed into me, but my eyes were glued shut. 

I knew exactly what it smelled like. 

I didn't even remember getting off of the plane. 

I  woke up, groggy, in the back of an SUV, my mouth full of metallic ick. 

I tried to move, and I couldn't, my arms reduced to sausages. 

I thought back to the water I sipped on the plane. How it tasted a little too bitter. 

“Did you fucking drug me?” I managed to get out in a hiss. 

I couldn't even panic, my body was paralyzed, my chest heaving, my heavy pants into thick leather seats were suffocating me. 

Nathanial’s laugh sounded like waves crashing into my skull. 

The car took a sharp turn, and I almost tumbled off of the seat. 

“It's just a small job, Johnson,” he said, “We’re counting on you.”

It took all my strength to drag myself to the window. 

I could see my breath coming out in clouds of white, tiny white flurries dancing across the pane. 

Snow. 

The drugs were fucking with my head. I slipped in and out of consciousness, dancing between the living and the dead. Ethan was sitting next to me, his head pressed against the window. “How do you even get out of shit like this?” he tried the door, slamming his fists against the door. 

“Locked,” he said. 

I managed a spluttered laugh. “No shit.” I caught myself. “What the fuck do I do?”

Ethan shrugged, his gaze glued to the snowstorm. “Maybe try diving out of the car?”

“When it's locked?!”

Before I could lecture Ethan on basic common sense, the real world slammed into me in waves of ice water– literally. 

Someone had opened my door, and I could feel the wind chill grazing the back of my neck. 

I opened my eyes when two muscled arms wrapped around me and yanked me out of the car. I couldn't stand, immediately falling limp in his grasp. 

“Come on, Johnson,” Nathanial’s voice tickled my ear. “We’re nearly there.”

I wasn't sure were ‘there’ was. I was up to my knees in snow, blurred white closing in on me from every angle. With my body immobile, Nathanial dragging me felt fucking dehumanising. He forced my head up, but it kept hanging, my thoughts dancing, my eyes flickering. 

“It's a simple job,” he said when I was more awake. 

In front of me was… something. 

It reminded me of a warehouse, a towering structure that almost looked like it was part of the storm. Nathanial pulled me further, chuckling. When I parted my lips to cry out, he promptly slammed his hand over my mouth. 

“Do the job well, Johnson, and we’ll think about taking you on full time.”

We reached a garage-like door, and with the click of a button, it was slowly gliding upwards. 

To my surprise, this place reminded me of a reception area inside a dentist. The floor was carpeted, a cosy lounging area filled with expensive looking sofas, and a TV playing what looked like an old cartoon. 

There was a desk, a short blonde wearing a Christmas hat sitting behind a laptop. 

“Nate.” she deadpanned, her gaze stuck to the laptop screen. “Did you get him?”

“No, Stella,” Nathanial’s tone pricked with sarcasm. “As you can see, I definitely don't have him.”

The girl nodded slowly. “Cooooooool.” she said. “Good talk.”

Ignoring Stella, Nathanial pulled me into an elevator. 

When the doors slid shut, I found my voice, pulling from his grasp, but my body was stiff and wrong. I dropped to my knees, shuffling back. “What the fuck is this place?”

The boy didn't answer, leaning against the door, his lips curled into a smirk. 

“It's a super special place.”

Something sickly crept up my throat. He was mimicking Mr Yellow’s words. 

My mother’s murderer. 

When the elevator slid open with a loud groan, the first thing I saw was intense clinical white light. 

The room reminded me of a surgical theatre that had long since been abandoned, flickering lights swinging overhead. I saw the first splatter of blood on the floor right in front of my feet. 

I've grown desensitised to blood over the years, but this was more than a splatter,  a dark crimson streak trailing all the way to the center of the room. There were four plastic chairs positioned in a circle. 

When I glimpsed velcro restraints hanging off of the arm rests, I felt my body start to twist and contort in a desperate attempt to escape. 

Two chairs were occupied by kids my age, metal helmets strapped to their heads; a strawberry blonde girl with her head bowed, her lips and chin stained scarlet. She was limp in the restraints, her body hanging forward. Opposite her was a guy, slumped over, hiding behind thick brown curls. 

There was a growing pool of red stemming around him. 

When he lifted his head, I had to fight back a cry. 

The guy’s eyes were pearly white, half lidded, all of the color drained from his iris. I recognized it. I had only ever heard of a kid’s power burning out through word of mouth. I had been taught that our abilities were like a muscle, and like a muscle, you could strain it. The first symptom of burnout was losing all the color in your eyes, but this guy was in the later stages. 

Judging by seeping red oozing from every orifice, he had already suffered multiple haemorrhages. 

My gaze found the helmet on his head. 

They kept bringing him back, forcing his body to revive again and again, purging his power for all it had. His lips were cracked, slick scarlet. I couldn't tell what his ability he possessed, or his level. Just that he was suffering. “You've gotta be… fucking… kidding me,” he sobbed. 

“Lucas, it's Christmas.” Nathanial mockingly scolded. “I told you about profanity.”

Nathanial forced me to stand. “All right, introductions!” he said cheerfully. “Guys, this is Johnson.” The strawberry blonde jolted in her chair, but she couldn't lift her head. “He's going to be helping us today.”

I cringed away when he patted me on the back. “Johnson! This is Luke and Tory! High level blues, and my favorite little helpers.”

Nathaniel shoved me into a chair, a metal helmet forced onto my head. Nathanial knelt in front of me, his eyes sparkling. 

Insanity, I thought dizzily. But there was something beyond that, a darkness shrouded in his eyes that he didn't want me to see. He pinned my wrists to the armrests, offering me a smile. “Your job,” he murmured in my ear. “Is *my* old job.”

He straightened up. “You see, we kept failing,” his expression twisted. “Every fucking year we failed, and more of us died. We couldn't do it. No matter how hard we tried, none of us were strong enough.”

I fought back, and with a simple twist of his wrist, my body was paralyzed. 

“I was the best we had,” Nathanial sighed. “They took me from the WYPA in Vancouver. I was just a kid. Eight, maybe? I was dragged inside this room, forced into one of these fucking chairs, and my brain was fried over and over again, until I was numb,” he choked out a hysterical giggle. 

“I stopped feeling pain around the tenth or twelvth time those fuckers brought me back. But it was okay, because I could do it. I was the only one who COULD fucking do it, so why not use me for all I have?”

Was he… crying? 

Nathaniel swiped at his eyes with his sleeve, forcing a smile. “Anyway, then the demand grew, and it was suddenly so much fucking harder to control, or even lift off the ground. I was tortured in an attempt to strengthen my power, but I couldn't do it.”

His smile widened. “But you guys are,” he started to clap. “So much stronger than me! I mean, you're fucking amazing. Sooo much better than little old me. Luke, who turned his entire town into his personal minions, and Tory! Who went one step further, and expanded her power across an entire country! Making herself Queen!”

The blonde let out a whimper, her bound hands jerking. 

Nathanial laughed. “It's charmed rope, you fucking idiot,” he rolled his eyes. “Developed by the CIA in the early 2010’s when they realized a certain generation were gaining abilities they didn't understand and couldn't control.”

His eyes found mine. 

“Johnson.” He said. “What you did to get yourself in the WYPA was quite remarkable! Honestly, I bow down to you.”

“Please.” Luke  whispered, spitting blood on the floor. “I… I *can't* do…it.”

“Well, guess what? It's your lucky day, Lucas, because you have help now!” Nathaniel danced over to him, patting his helmet. When the boy lunged at him, he spluttered. “Ooh, bad dog! What did I fucking say about using your teeth?”

Lucas didn't respond, and I noticed the glint in Nathanial’s eyes. He wasn't just crazy. This asshole revelled in being in  control. “Soo, over the last few years, we’ve always focused on movement,” he twisted around, winking at me. “Now that, my fellow freakish children, was a mistake.”

A large wooden contraption was dragged in.

“Because why focus on movement?” Nathanial continued. “When we have something even better?”

I recognized what it was. 

The holiday lights strung across the back seat.  

The back, filled with sacks overflowing with wrapped gifts and toys. 

“Okay!” Nathanial shouted to someone above us. “Let's do a test run, all right? Everyone in position?”

“Nate.” Tory’s strangled cry sliced through the silence. She whipped her head back, her eyes rolling back to pearly whites. “You're going to kill us!”

Ignoring her, he turned to me. “How many people have you taken over, Johnson?” Nathaniel came closer, his eyes narrowing, lips curving into a spiteful smile. “How many minds can you force yourself inside?”

His question sent prickles of ice slipping down my spine. 

I hadn't answered that question in a long time. I was too scared to. 

“I don't know,” I managed to get out. 

“Aww, come on!” Nathanial cocked his head. “Maybe… a million?” he wagged his brows. “Two million?”

“I didn't mean to,” the words were choking my throat before I could stop them. I didn't realize how right the chair felt, the restraints, until I was reminded that I really was a fucking monster. “I was just a kid.”

Nathaniel’s expression softened, his lip twisting. “I know you were,” he said. “So was I when I told my pops to off himself.” he frowned. “Which begs the question,” he hummed. “You're a category blue at one of the highest levels, and yet the fuck faces back at WYPA decided not to toast you.”

It looked like he might continue, before a yell cut him off. 

“Nate, we’re all ready!” It sounded like Stella, from upstairs. “I just need your go ahead!”

Nathanial didn't respond for a moment. He slowly made his way over to me, fixing my helmet on my head, and checking my restraints. I thought he was sympathetic, or maybe he was, in his own fucked up way. But then he was running his hands through my hair, grabbing a fistful, and forcing me to look at him. 

His eyes terrified me. Not because of his ability, or his descent into madness. 

But because somewhere, deep, deep down, twisted in traumatised eyes filled with agony, I think part of him didn't even want to do this. 

“What you did, Johnson,” he whispered, “Fifteen years ago. I want you to do it again.” 

Turning to the others, the boy grinned. 

“How many children are on the planet, hmm? How many of those little fuckers believe in the big guy?”

I didn't notice it at first. 

The pain. It was numb first, dull, like a phantom nothing dancing across my skull. 

It was like being hit by lightning an infinite number of times. 

Each one hit the back of my head, burning a hole inside it. 

I didn't realize I was screaming, crying, choking on my blood  begging for mercy. 

When I was a kid, it almost felt like drowning. I didn't feel pain, instead, a stark numbness taking hold of me, and the crushing weight of names, wishes, memories, thoughts, bleeding inside me. 

Back then, I barely grazed their minds. I just gave them an order, and they did it. 

Then I let go, plunging down, down, down, and awakening in my mother’s arms. 

This time, I found each and every one. Ones that had grown up with me, and ones that were much younger, entangling myself with them. I could feel my brain coming apart, bleeding, running down my temples, and seeping down the back of my neck. “2.4 billion,” Nathanial said. “That's 2.4 billion minds to give one simple order.”

Fly. 

The word twisted on my lips, but that was more prominent inside my mind. 

Whatever was on my head, the helmet strapped to my skull, I could feel it moulding itself to my spinal chord, a screech ripping from my lips. 

I was burning, suddenly, my brain igniting, my body jerking left and right. 

I could already feel wet warmth running from my nose, my lips, my ears, every vessel inside me coming apart, a neutron star collision dancing across the backs of my eyes. The command was already inside my head. 

Our heads. 

I could sense and feel, almost touch Luke’s mind. 

Tory was harder, fading in and out, her body was already failing, already rejecting it. 

In front of me, the wooden contraption moved slightly, and Lucas’s head dropped. When it started to hover, Tory’s scream grew feral, animalistic, her cries growing into pleads, begging for death. 

The sleigh had taken flight, hovering above us. 

But I couldn't sense Luke anymore. That entangled string binding us together, had been cut. Through half lidded eyes, I think he was moving, his fingers still twitching under velcro straps. There was a gaping cavern of glistening gore where Tory’s brain was supposed to be, slimy pinkish grey splattering the ground around her chair. 

But the sleigh was flying, and despite the agony ripping through me, my body slowly shutting down, my mouth became a smile. 

I was aware of my head going limp, all of me slumping, my head tipping back. 

“That's right!” Nathanial’s voice was fading. “Make Santa flyyyyyyyyyy.”

Yeah, I thought, unable to resist a spluttered giggle. 

I was making Santa fly.

After three test runs, and then the real thing, spluttering on my last gasps of air. 

But, with the children's help, we really had saved Christmas. 

I was partially aware of Nathanial lifting me from the chair and dumping my body somewhere cold, somewhere where the ice cold chill thankfully took me peacefully. 

Dying felt weirdly comfortable, kind of like falling asleep. 

I always thought I would die on a surgical table, my body used for research. 

Or burned to ashes in the incinerator. 

But death was… cozy. 

“I'm, like, really fucking warm.”

Ethan’s voice pricked into my mind, and I found myself side by side with him. He was lying on something ice cold, his wrists strapped down. I didn't know what to say, so I rolled onto my back, “Well, I just died.” 

“But you died in a cool way.” Ethan chuckled. “Driving freakin’ Santa's sleigh. That's one hell of a way to go out, right?”

“Mmm.” I said. “Also, of hypothermia.”

I noticed where we were, sitting up, my head hitting the ceiling. 

Wherever we were was too narrow and claustrophobic. 

“Fuck.” I hissed, kicking the ceiling. “Where are you?”

“I’d… rather not answer that,” Ethan said, shooting me a sickly smile. “Can we just… talk?”

I pretended not to see the ignition of oranges getting brighter and brighter. 

Closer and closer. 

“Sure.” I said, swallowing a cry. “We can… talk.” 

‘Carlisle escaped today,” he murmured, after a moment. “So, expect the world to get a whole lot fucking crazier with her free.”

Those were words I really did not want to hear. 

Still, though. With Carlisle free, maybe anything was possible. 

The orange blur was growing bigger, and I squeezed my eyes shut. 

“Merry Christmas, Johnson,” Ethan murmured, his wide smile erupting into raging fire melting the flesh from his bones. “And happy fucking birthday to me.”",3,1734307668.0,u_Trash_Tia,1,1.0,False

Okay. So. I do not know where to start, so sorry if I ramble on forever or something.

I am 27, AMAB and I am not sure what my gender is or what to do about it.

I remember wishing to be a girl since the age of six, at the very least. I also had a number of traditionally feminine interests and found I had a much easier time befriending and relating to girls than boys. Of course, this could just be because I had some feminine interests and several personality traits usually read as feminine or at least unmasculine. And I know that the idea of ""gendered interests"" or ""gendered personality traits"" is socially constructed bs, so things like me not liking cars or soccer or whatever, me being the only boy (?) that cried when we found dead birds on the schoolyard, that obviously doesn't have to mean stuff. Maybe I only wanted to be a girl because I felt I was bad at performing masculinity and more compatible with what was traditionally presented as ""girl stuff""? Idk.

During my teens, my thoughts largely disappeared, or I don't remember having them alot, anyway. Maybe an occasional, idk, ""flare"" of thought going ""I'd rather be a girl"". At the same time, for the first time in my life, I was making male friends, though I remember ""performing"" alot to fit in eith them. Like, yeah, I liked metal music, but for them I overplayed it as a part of my personality and for them I pretended to like black coffee. I liked videogames well enough, but for them I started identifying as a gamer. You get the picture. On the other hand, I remember looking at clothes catalogues and thinking about how many dresses looked so pretty and being sad that my bodyshape was not made for them. I also felt some envy over the beauty of some girls. At the time, of course, I assumed it was attraction and, to be frank, I still aren't sure it wasn't? Like, I had not really figured out that I was aroace (it was a countrysite village, I knew about straight and gay, I was, like, 14 when I heard about being bi, every other part of the LGBTQ+ spectrum was, as war as I had been informed, something hypothetical and weird that happened to other people, I am deeply ashamed over many views I held back then), and so, it struck me as odd that I had no interest in dating or... physical rituals of affection... but girls were pretty, occasionally hot, even, and I did not think much harder about it?

So then I went to uni, where I had the culture shock of my life and realized that my small town-liberalism was not, in fact, the far left end of the political spectrum and that lead to me pretty quickly figuring out the aroace-thing, but reopening the matter of exploring my gender was a different beast alltogether. As my peer group became increasingly left wing (and also returned to being largely female), I was exposed to first hand accounts of trans experiences and realized that they could be. Idk. Much more ""casual"" than I would have imagined? Like, I had assumed they would be so different, basically alien from where I saw myself, but now I recognized myself in so much of it and I started feeling this sort of ""pull"", if that makes sense, like I would entertain the thought of being trans and there was this odd, stinging pain in me. So then, for the first time, I thought ""Maybe I am a woman?""

And then BOOM, suddenly for the first time in my entire life, I look at artworks of huge muscular, bearded men and something in me actually goes ""Neat, I would like to look like that!"" I swear, not a single time, in my entire life, before this point, had any concept of traditional masculinity appealed to me, but suddenly my brain went ""I wanna be a viking"" the fucking second I was almost at the point of accepting myself as a trans woman? It almost felt like a defense reaction, like my brain was overcorrecting to keep me bound to a male identity. Since then, my gender perception has been... confusing and unstable. Often I am drawn to contradicting ideals of what I would wish my body looked like.

For a while I tried being okay with that, joking that ""I had no idea what my gender is and at this point I'm afraid to ask"". But I feel like not having a concrete idea of what I am is actually hurting me. Existing in this odd... liminal space of conflicting identities, it is becoming unpleasant.

This song always reminds me of the moment and evening we first met. Well, it reminds us both of that special evening.

You introduced me to this song back then. I thought I knew all of Coldplay’s best songs until you introduced me to Sparks.

Do you recall how we would walk into places and this song would be playing? Even when we were apart or I was at work, the coffee shop you used to go to during the week when I wasn’t there. ♥️

1hf65ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/teen_venting/comments/1hf65ws/i_just_want_the_weight_gone/,i just want the weight gone,"i'm 15 and i've been struggling with self image issues since i was 10. 

i've had problems with disordered eating habits in response to traumatic situations for years, namely in regards to not eating when i get stressed and temporarily associating food with getting screamed at and being unable to eat without almost throwing up. throughout middle school i drank entire pots of coffee before school everyday to suppress my appetite so that i wouldn't get hungry. i still do this every now and then, but not nearly as often.

i've hated looking at myself in the mirror for as long as i can remember(which is admittedly not very long, i have a lot of really big gaps in my memory), and a lot of it stems from my weight. i'm not necessarily overweight, but i'm what my mom has described as ""husky"". i'm 5'8 and around 160-170 pounds. my sister frequently makes comments about my weight when and if i eat something because she's 5'6 and less than 110 pounds so she likes to try and make comments about me for some reason.

based on the way i dress it's not easy to tell that i have a little extra weight because i wear baggy clothes that do a decent job of hiding my body.

i've tried working out which hasn't helped much because i build muscle easily but burning fat doesn't happen. i was on ozempic and that helped me drop 20-30 pounds because i used to be 190 not all too long ago.

i though i was getting better about not having as many issues with my weight and body, but im not. i almost cried today trying on a pair of pants because the size of pants i get didn't fit. i wear a 32/32 and i tried on a pair of levi's in that size and couldn't even button them up. i left the changing room to get a bigger size to try on but when i got out of there all i wanted to do was relapse. 

i've had problems with self harm in the past and i haven't wanted to hurt myself that badly in months. 

i just want to lose weight and get it off my body. i dont care how unhealthy it is i just want it gone. i've been looking into those liposuction things that actually remove the fat from your body permanently, but that would require asking my mom about it and having to explain this stuff to her, which is the last thing i wanna do.

do any of you know any fast and easy ways to lose weight? i dont care how unhealthy it is i just want options.

Because it's typically not that bad, I feel really whiny when it flairs 😭. I have noticed an increasing pattern of worsening whenever I get time off from work, and I can't figure out if it's the time off or the work that's the problem. Wondering if any of you have dealt with this.

I am a 61 yo woman who has probably had this to a degree since college. Mainly is flu-like aches and burning skin pain, never as much energy as I want to have but enough to get the basics done. I raised two kids plus working full time. In the last several years, I have progressively less energy after work. My thyroid is fine, no anemia, etc. I had long covid for about 6 months in 2020 with persistent asthma, fatigue, post exertion fevers.

I try to exercise in zone 2 when I can, sometimes most mornings M-F. But after work I am a slug. I warm up leftovers in the microwave and put the bowl in the fridge until morning bc washing it is too much 😅. Get up in the morning and do it again.

Then on the weekend or vacation when I finally have time to do what I really want to do-- watercolor, quilt, read, go for a walk, maybe see my friends-- a lot of times I never even make it off the couch to the shower. I keep thinking oh, I must have the flu/covid or something. I am bone tired, aches like flu, feel like I have a fever but don't, sometimes nausea and diarrhea. I don't drink. I have one cup of coffee every morning, no variation in caffeine.

I manage to pull it together for work on Monday and get through the week. I don't hate my job-- it's fine, friendly coworkers-- but I really really love painting and being outside. So I feel my ""real life"" is hardly ever happening.

I find myself longing to retire and paint but can't afford it early, realistically. I am responsible for my disabled adult son with schizophrenia who lives with me, and he's on the waiting list for housing. Maybe I could go part time in a couple of years or if he ever gets housing. So I could get a smaller apartment.

But I wonder sometimes... will I have more energy if I don't have to work full time, or will I be worse off? I have never been able to take enough consecutive time off to find out. Wondering if anyone here has experience with this pattern.",2,1734307337.0,Fibromyalgia,0,1.0,False

Title: Casserole Justice $*#%
Setting: A small, dingy office in a nondescript building. The company’s purpose is unclear—something pointless like “rating the sound quality of elevator music.” The office is run-down, with flickering lights, a buzzing old vending machine, and a weird smell no one wants to talk about.

Opening Shot:
	•	The camera pans across the outside of the office—a brick building in a neglected strip mall. A cheap sign reads, “Corporate Ratings, LLC: Experts in Nothing Important.” A flickering “OPEN” sign hangs on the glass door.

Inside:
	•	The office is cluttered with tiny desks, mismatched furniture, and outdated computers.

SCENE 1: LUNCH ROOM CHAOS
(The bell dings loudly, signaling lunch. Everyone groans in relief. Amy lights a cigarette indoors, ignoring the “No Smoking” sign as the walks by.)

Amy: (raspy) “Lunch time, I’ve been waiting to get to my casserole alll dayy !”
(She stomps to the fridge, flings it open, then freezes, eyes wide.)

Amy: (yelling) “WHO THE FUCK ATE MY CASSEROLE?!”
(The room goes quiet except for Wendy slurping coffee obnoxiously and Todd unraveling a burrito wrapper.)

[Enter Gary, slowly walking into frame] 

Gary (Custodian): (smirking, leaning on his mop almost stumbling) “Maybe it got tossed out. You know, for umm, health violations or whatever.”

(Cut to Gary standing outside the office, smoking a cigarette leaning on a mop in a bucket.)

(Little pause)

Gary: (mocking tone) “Or maybe I ate it.”
(Pause. He looks directly into the camera.)

Gary: (deadpan) “Yeah, I ate it. I mean she really can’t get mad I mean that shit was,(deep breath eyes closed) delicious.”

(Cut to earlier that morning. Gary sneaks into the break room, opens the fridge opens up the blue container, sniffs the casserole suspiciously, shrugs, and takes a bite.)

(Back to present: Gary sneaks into the lunchroom while everyone is distracted. He sees Amy distracted running a mutt questioning Todd, he pretends to grab a napkin, then shoves the remaining casserole into his sweater. He casually walks back to his janitor closet slowly and sits at his tiny desk.)

Cut to him in his tiny custodial closet, hiding under his sweater, shoveling the casserole into his mouth with a stapler as a makeshift spoon. He freezes as footsteps approach Gary rushes in.

Gary: (mouth full, muffled) “Gary, old buddy. This is a low point, even for you.”

He quickly shoves the casserole into a tiny trash can under his desk just as his co-worker, Chuck, walks in.

Chuck: (oblivious, holding a file) “Hey, man. You know yo can talk to me right, let me get to the point that little web cam right there. we seen what was on it you dirty boy . You know th—

Gary: (shocked)  “WHAT!?.”  I mean what how did—.”

Cuts to Chuck a couple day before sitting in the lunch room Gary say’s” I’m going to the grocery story anything u want for me to get u for lunch old pal” Chuck follows with “ Nothing really Susan packed me lunch today” Gary say’s “In a lunchbox okay bye” then walks away after Gary walks away Chuck looks at his room then its cuts to him the camera facing the back of his computer set up his face goes from curious to disgusted then he hurry’s up to click out and speed walks out then it’s cut to outside office of the office 

Chuck:(inspired tone)“ I’m the only one who , seen it but this is all for black mail… yup, I’m gonna use this to get into the … Fridge Mob my old Friend Gary’s been trying to hide from …. “

Cuts back to Gary’s office 

Chuck: (surprised) So I’m in?”
Gary: (angry) “Now get the fuck out my office.”

Chuck: (shocked them that turns to madness)
“What the fuck Gary am in —.”

Gary gets up and pushes him out then locks his office door he sits don’t then the door creeks open and Chucks still standing there “Am I in” he takes a deep breath then screams but it cuts off
To the theme song and intro.

Scene Two: The Lunchroom Gossip

Cut back to the lunchroom.

Amy: (still fuming) “This is why I label my food! This office is full of fucking Seagulls!”
(Raises her tone)Who the hell eats someone else’s lunch?!”

[Another worker, Todd, the camera locks in behind Amy’s shoulder, he’s-eating a sad-looking microwave burrito.]

Todd: (food flying out his mouth ,muttering) “Could’ve been an accident.”

Amy: (turns around snaps at him) “Todd, I saw you steal Wendy’s yogurt last week. You’re on thin fucking ice.”

Amy: (slight pause) “and keep your food in your fucking mouth it’s fucking , unsanitary.”

Wendy (an exhausted, overworked mother of two): (chiming in, monotone) “I don’t even care anymore. I just buy extras or offer some but everyone always’s say’s no, then someone still eats them.”

Amy: (dramatic) “You can’t let them win, Wendy! That’s how the system crumbles ,your stronger than that!”

[Another worker, Karen (eccentric and paranoid), interjects.]

Karen: (wide-eyed) “It’s probably all part of a bigger plan. They’re testing us. The Fridge mob is growing and it’s the people you would never, expect .”

Todd: (rolling his eyes) “Karen, this isn’t Watergate. It’s lunch and stop being so fucking suspenseful, what the fuck is that about”

(Todd looks at the camera shrugging mouthing the fuck)

Amy: “It’s war, Todd!”

Skit Insert #1
	 Karen’s “Conspiracy Corner”
	•	A quick 1-minute skit showing Karen creating a “Fridge Theft Flowchart” on the office whiteboard. She pins random photos of co-workers to it like it’s a crime drama, muttering about “patterns” and “inside jobs.” At one point, she dramatically connects two photos with red string and whispers, “It’s always the quiet ones.”

Scene Three: 

Cut to the main office. Everyone is back at their desks, working half-heartedly.

Todd: (to Wendy) “Why do we even care about filing chalk art permits? Nobody’s out here protesting bad sidewalk art.”

Wendy: (typing without looking up) “One time, I had to file a permit for a guy who wanted to paint a giant hotdog on the street. It got denied.”

Todd: (snorting) “Why?”

Wendy: “Too phallic.”

Amy: (walking by, deadpan) “Fuck U TODD.”

Karen: (overhearing from her cubicle waits until Amy walks by) “I had to file a permit for lady who wanted to have her dead grandmother spray painted in the street so when she looks out the window in the morning she’s her.”

(Slight pause)

Todd: (sarcastically in disbelief) “Deeeeeeep”

Skit Insert #2: Todd’s Microwave Disaster
	•	A quick skit showing Todd microwaving fish in the break room, setting off the fire alarm. The staff scramble to turn it off while Amy yells, “WHO THE FUCK MICROWAVES FISH?!”

Ep Ending: Gary’s Guilt 

Cut to Gary at his desk, staring guiltily at the tiny trash can under his feet.

Gary: (muttering to himself) “It wasn’t even good casserole.”

Amy storms in, holding a Tupperware lid.

Amy: (glaring) “Gary.”

Gary: (nervously) “…Yes?”

Amy: (calm but deadly) “You owe me casserole. And a blue Tupperware. You know what happens to thieves, Gary?”

Gary: (gulping) “…They get fired?”

Amy: (leaning in close) “No. They get casserole justice bitch.”

Fade to black for a second

After ending Scene: Craig’s Delusions and Paul’s Pitch

Setting: The office floor. Most people have already packed up for the day. Craig, sitting at his desk, is speaking with Luke, a fresh-faced, wide-eyed employee who’s trying to figure out where he fits in. Craig leans back in his chair with a self-important smirk.

Craig: (arms crossed, exuding fake authority)
“Listen, kid, the key to surviving here is knowing who’s really running things. Spoiler alert—it’s me. Management can’t make a move without checking in with me.”

Luke: (hesitant, holding a stack of folders)
“Wait, so… you’re not just in charge of, uh…” (checks the label on Craig’s desk) “…mailroom operations?”

Craig: (laughing dismissively)
“Mailroom? Sure, on paper. But let me tell you something about leadership, Luke: Titles mean nothing . You wanna get ahead, you learn from someone who knows the ropes. And I, my friend, am the ropes.”

[Paul enters from stage right, carrying a half-empty cup of coffee and overhears the conversation.]

Paul: (stopping mid-step, raising an eyebrow)
“Craig? Did you just say you’re ‘the ropes’? What ropes? You staple envelopes and refill the printer paper. You’re like… one notch above the recycling bin.”

Craig: (offended, standing up)
“Excuse me? I do a hell of a lot more than that, Paul!”

Paul: (grinning)
“Oh, I’m sorry. You’re also the guy who locked himself in the supply closet for three hours last month because you thought you saw your ex wife.”

Luke: (stifling a laugh)
“Wait, that was you? I thought IT said it was a power outage.”

Craig: (flustered, grabbing his bag)
“You know what? Screw this. You don’t appreciate me. None of you do! One day, this whole office is gonna fall apart without me, and you’ll be begging me to come back.”

Paul: (mock serious, as Craig storms off)
“Of course, Craig. We’ll hold a candlelight vigil in the break room. Blue Tupperware optional.”

[Craig slams the door on his way out.]

Paul turns to Luke, who’s still holding his stack of folders, looking thoroughly confused. Paul leans casually against Luke’s desk.**

Paul: (conspiratorially)
“Alright, Luke. Now that the big boss is gone, let me run something by you. You’re in IT, right?”

Luke: (nervously)
“Uh… yeah. I mean, I just started, so I’m mostly fixing logins and stuff—”

Paul: (cutting him off, leaning closer)
“Perfect. You’re gonna love this. You ever thought about creating an app that, like… tracks how long people spend in the bathroom? I mean, think about it. Think about it.”

Luke: (staring, horrified)
“An app for… what?!”

Paul: (gesturing wildly)
“Productivity metrics! You see Brenda disappearing every day at 3 PM. Is she actually pooping, or is she just hiding from Karen’s conspiracy theories? With the Bathroom Tracker™—working title—you’d know.”

Luke:
“I—what—no, absolutely not! That’s… insane. And maybe illegal?”

Paul: (grinning)
“Illegal? You know what else was illegal once? Selling alcohol. But look where we are now—bars on every corner. Visionaries like me change the world, Luke.”

Luke: (deadpan)
“Yeah, but nobody’s changing the world by spying on Brenda in the bathroom.”

Paul: (shrugs)
“Hey, you don’t innovate without taking risks. Let me know if you change your mind. The domain name’s still available.”

[Paul strolls off, leaving Luke standing there, staring after him, utterly baffled.]

End Scene
	•	The camera lingers on Luke for a moment as he shakes his head, muttering to himself, “What the hell is wrong with this place?”

(Or Michigan in general. ,"Looking to get the heck out of the south. I can’t deal with the 9 months of oppressive humidity any longer. I thrive in the cold and love the snow and Nashville is slowly draining the life out of me after 15 years here.

I’m a 33F and work remotely. It’s just me and my cat and I’d like to explore living somewhere else, even if it’s not my forever city. I’d like to head north— I’ve been looking at Maine (too expensive), Michigan, and possibly Pennsylvania (too humid still?) or upstate NY. 

I don’t need to be in a huge city— as long as there’s a couple good coffee shops and maybe a bookstore, I’m happy. Also somewhat close proximity to an airport that’s decently connected. (I travel to PHL for work often so a direct flight there would be ideal). 

I do like nature — lakes, hills, mountains, EASY hikes (I’m outsidey not outdoorsy). As well as any kind of creative activity or event. Mostly I’m boring and my idea of a good time is a walk, a coffee, or a nice dinner. (On that note, I do have celiac so anywhere with GF options is a plus). 

I’ve really been looking at the Holland / Grand Rapids area of Michigan. The weather and nature seem up my alley and I’m hoping the presence of some colleges means some fun coffee shops and an art scene. (And possibly young adults? Although I realize now that 33 is practically middle age lmao). Any thoughts about these places? I also have friends in Ypsilanti, though I haven’t researched it extensively yet. I’m really open to anywhere that doesn’t feel like Satan’s armpit 9 months of the year. 

As far as cost and transportation go, I have a car and don’t entirely mind having to drive places. Also wouldn’t want to spend much more than $1500 a month on rent. ",7,1734307293.0,SameGrassButGreener,10,1.0,False

He is very controlling with the money but even after I explained my friend from work bought it for me he was still upset. He said it was the principle of it and he couldn’t trust me to go out. He accused me of selling myself to get the coffee because I was wearing lipstick. Just absurd accusations that made no sense. He escalated until he was screaming in my face. He drenched me in cold brew from our fridge. From head to toe. In top of that he wouldn’t let me shower or change my clothes. Then he locked me outside to clean his car in 8 degree weather. I didn’t have my jacket on, just a thin blouse and dress pants. I was locked out and had no phone. He didn’t care how cruel he was being. He acted like a father scolding his child. Saying stuff like “the sooner you finish this the sooner you can come back inside” and “I hope you’re learning your lesson”. It was infuriating. 



My hands and feet went numb. I was the coldest I’ve ever been in my life. I asked him numerous times to let me back inside to change clothes at least. He didn’t care and even laughed and mocked me when I was crying. My entire body was shaking and I felt disoriented by thr time I finished, maybe 20 or 30 mins later. He went into nice guy mode and even pretended to be concerned about me. I just let him take care of me, I wasn’t in much of a state to take care of myself or stop him. I often wonder whether that kindness comes from his need to make himself feel better or to make me feel better.

1hf62fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hf62fl/break_up_and_shared_assets_solutionsadvice_please/,Break up and shared assets solutions/advice please. ,"Hi guys. My ex and I split up beginning of October. He split up with me - although at 1st hurt and sad, after some space from them  and how things being recently I see it as a good thing now. I want to focus on myself and move forward and close this chapter in my life. After the move and settling in I am going to ask him to not to talk for couple of months to just let the emotions go down and see if we would got on as friends and build from there if possible.

Context: mid 30s, almost 3 years together, co-own furnishing. we have 2 dogs.  He borrowed from me £8k couple of years ago and still owes me £6k. We bough 55"" £1089 Tv, £600 washing machine, £700 dyson vacuum cleaner that is in bad condition but still working, sofa worth £2k. We upscaled furniture. Restoring them involved sanding it and beeswaxing (by my ex). while he is very good at DIY I am also great and finding gems for free so in my mind we equally own them. Plus we bought other stuff- most things we have we co-own.

We're splitting the dogs. I take older and already trained and stable dog - my ex put a lot of work into it and tought me a lot in the process of it. And he is taking younger and more difficult dog that I cannot handle safely outside - he has skills to manage the dog and potential to train them up. Nonetheless, we both are more emotionally attached to the older dog as it's been with us longer and less difficult than the other. Obviously this is unquantifiable exchange but he could have rehomed the other one (I suggested it when we were still together but he was adamant he wanted to try to train up the dog and still wants to keep the younger one). If he rehomed the younger dog the older dog might have gone with my ex as I think he will be a better owner provided he was the only dog and he has more time for him. And I would like what is best for he dog. The older dog is also reactive as he is a rescue and I might need his help in the 1st year to make sure I handle him safely outside and advice. I did mentioned that if the other dog mellows down with age as the older biy did and the problematic areas are resolved we could swap the dogs back (but tbh not sure if I manage to give the boy back - I bonded even more with him while my ex has been away). Although I feel confident as I learnt a lot and we had trainers. So I should really try to keep things amicable and try to come to solution re the furniture in case there is a problem and I might need his help with the dog in future as much as I'd love to not be in contact with my ex really. I must say his communication is not the greatest and it is frustrating at times.

Due to, let's call it, misunderstanding. My ex thought he'll keep the sofa and the TV - original value over £3k. Got upset about me listing it for the sale. I got offer of £700 for the TV but it seems to be scam. Someone came to see the sofa that I listed down to £600. It seems his place is unfurnished and maybe bigger to what I found.

Because he owns me a lot of money, I didn't consider he would buy me out from sofa and TV, hence listing it to sell it. I was planning to split it a half and give him his half - but he feels I leave him with nothing and not keeping to my word of him wanting to be okay. In my mind dividing expensive shared assets and being okay are 2 different things. I bought an expensive training equipment for one of our dogs that I paid. We have agreement of dogs sitting when one goes away, but he has been already away for 3 weeks and I have been taking care of both dogs before he gone away and after as he has not been staying much in the flat, so since early October really. My feeling towards him has changed lately, understandably, his certain ways now that we are not together and I do not love him the same way after the split are making things worse too - I'm tired of it after having experienced that throughout our relationship, eve though he was the one that initiated the break up. We did initially talked about being friends but the longer time passed the more I am coming to conclusions it is something that will serve way more him than me - I do not need as much and as many close relationships with others as he does.

I am/would like to keep the love seat bought used for £120, mini dishwasher bought used for £110,  free bed frame upcycled and mattress and topper bought for around £230 and bedding, free non-upcycled chest of drawers, gifted by him wardrobe worth £160; 3 items gifted by him: bike worth £1k, bike computer worth £500 and pressure cooker worth £300 although technically they are gifts, old dyson hoover that he keeps complaining about how quickly it deteriorated so much + all the dogs' stuff. So without the gifts it'd be maybe £1k including the battered down dyson on its way out. We might split some kitchenware too althoug hmost of them deteriorated quite a bit.

There's a lot other furnire we co-owe some of them got for free and upcycled - 2 bookcases, dining tabl with 2 chairs, coffee table. Plus 2 ottomans/storage, billy book case with doors - narrow one. I think all the ones we paid for came down to almost £5k (including the sofa and TV) as I amde a spreadsheet to evaluate them.

I was thinking of some options:

1. to ask him how much would he spend on sofa, TV and bed if he was to buy it if he had extra cash. Divide it by half and ask to pay me that- could use one of he furniture listing on eBay so he can use his credit card as he has no cash right now. Or him buying me some things I will need: mini electric oven for £150, tow bar bike carrier for my car - used or new around £150.
2. Or ask him to provide services in near future: such as pick up second hand garden shed in a van he has and put it up, he'll help me move and will need to attach the furniture to the walls and bike clamps to keep them indoor. When I move next to help me fill the holes and move and do some light DIY, service my bikes when needed etc. Generally he is very good handy man and helpful although an ex s who knows when new woman comes into the picture. When we were together he promised to fit dashcams and mudguards for my car that I paid for so could include that in ""services"". 
3. Sell the goods and give him half as originally planned so he can buy things with that cash. E.g. I would get sofa for £300 o so via fb marketplace myself and probably find free bed frame as many people would get rid of it if collected by someone else. New mattress could be £100-200 and bedding around £100 - so already £600; not sure how much the cheapest playstation compatible TV would be (he plays it with his sons).

Please be kind to me!

The title pretty much sums up everything that I've been thinking about and going through.

I was in a QPR with my best friend of 10+ years for just over 2 and 1/2 years. The reason we got into a QPR was because we were each others best friends, and we thought that the chemistry of our friendship would carry over into the relationship. I think we did achieve that, but down the line there were a lot of unspoken expectations being brought into the relationship and it didn't sit well with my ex-partner, who for context is AroAce. I now realize that I was placing these expectations on not just her but us as a whole, as I thought that there was a specific way that relationships should look like and act, as taught to us by what the ""norm"" is within society, that norm being what romantic relationships look like. Looking back, I don't even care about meeting those expectations, and I critically failed to realize within my relationship that every relationship is different, and QPR's are no exception to that. It's funny how it took a breakup for me to realize what I actually care about and value within a relationship, but sometimes that's just the way life goes. You make mistakes, but you learn from them.

Nonetheless, along with my introspection and going through the process of, well, processing the relationship, I've been thinking about A LOT of things, some of which being the thought/idea of dating other people, both now or in the future. For context, even before my QPR I had tried to date other people with the traditional method of dating apps and going out to parties/bars kinda thing, but no matter how much I tried or no matter how pretty or beautiful I may had found someone, I always felt really weird trying to initiate romance or sexual desire for someone I didn't even know. It really just felt *unnatural,* but I shrugged it off because at the time I thought I was just scared of women and was being too picky hahaha. But even now, as a newly single man, the idea of getting into a relationship with someone who I haven't made an emotional connection with, or who I haven't known for a while, feels really wrong to me, and frankly makes me very uncomfortable. I don't really have another way of describing this feeling other than it making me feel awkward and uncomfortable. And to that point, when I got into my QPR with my best friend, I realized that the anxiety I used to have about getting into a relationship was non-existent with her. Like, the way of doing things and the sequence of events that led up to us getting into a partnership just felt *right.*

Jokes aside, I know however that I am not scared of women or trying to form relationships, as I'm a very outgoing and extroverted individual and I never shy away from wanting to talk to someone, man or woman. I love to talk to people just for the sake of being friendly; however, I now realize that for a WHILE I've mistook friendly intentions and platonic attraction with both romantic and or sexual intentions and romantic/sexual attraction. As silly as that may sound, THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME THING, but I guess allo people think that being friendly (helping a friend through a hard time, or hanging out with them at a coffee shop, or going on outings with them), especially if they are of the other sex, can hold a romantic intention behind it, and this very thing has gotten me in a lot of trouble with friends of mine as they could not distinguish platonic attraction and platonic intentions from romantic attraction and romantic intentions. I *can* distinguish what commitment is and what a friendship is, and I know enough to not emotionally cheat on a partner of mine. But I guess other people don't see it in that same way?

I also am realizing that I haven't had many crushes in my life, and for the 2 or 3 crushes that I have had, they were admittedly all my friends. They were all people that I knew, and people that I grew to know over the course of some period of time. Once again, I just kinda shrugged this off as the typical love-life experience. I really thought that this was the way that EVERYONE experienced attraction and made long-term committed relationships with people. You meet someone, you become friends, you do stuff together platonically as you get to know them, and once you know them enough over the course of some time and form a strong enough emotional connection with one another, then and only then are you able to consider if you have romantic or sexual attraction towards them. Personality and emotional bond over looks any day of the week. This is why this has been so mind boggling, because... I thought everyone experienced their love life in this way, and I'm now learning that that's not the case???

This kinda dawned on me when I was at the club with some buddies a while back. I never once have looked at someone I found attractive and went, ""oh you're hot I wanna get in your pants"" or ""you're hot I wanna go on a date with you and see if our personalities match"". Even if I did find someone attractive, it was more in my mind along the lines of ""whoa that person is pretty!"", like the same way I would look at a sunset or a cool picture that I like. If I found someone attractive, as weird as this may be to say, I kinda just wanted to watch them do stuff? Just the appreciation of beauty with no hidden motive or intention behind it. And whenever I did chat with people, even my friends, I always talked with them for the intentions of being friends, nothing more or nothing less. If the ""more than friends"" attraction came later down the line then I would accept it, but I've never done anything with the intention of being more than friends off the bat, if that makes sense?

I came across the term ""demisexuality"" quite some time ago when I was doing research about those who are AroAce, and I learned early on in my relationship what that was and the spectrum that is aromanticism and asexuality. However, with me thinking that I was alloromantic and never really considering anything aside from that, I just never thought of my own experiences and how they may differ from the experiences and understandings of other allos. I just kinda assumed that my allo experiences were the same as everyone elses... and as humbling as this is to say, I'm only now realizing that this is not the case. In the span of just over a week, I've learned about primary and secondary attraction, the experiences of those who consider themselves to be demi, what demisexuality and demiromanticism is, and a bunch of other forms of attraction such as but not limited to: platonic, aesthetic, alterous, fleeting, and a deeper understanding of what romantic and sexual attraction is... and I relate to it more than I thought I would. For myself, I think I experience platonic and aesthetic attraction at first, but down the line after forming a deep emotional bond with someone, I start to experience alterous attraction for those I am interested in.

To those part of the community, are these the same kind of experiences/realizations you had when you were finding out you were demi? What are your stories when you realized you were demi? I can't help but have the slightest bit of imposter syndrome, but I feel like there's something there that I haven't had the courage to look at in a deeper sense up until now. As someone who never thought of themselves associating with the LGBTQ+ community, this all feels very new and scary to me. I'd love to hear peoples thoughts and experiences:))

[""I've known a bunch of minor B-C list celebs. Musicians, Broadway, movies, all of it. One of my very best friends is a C-list working actor. 15-20 years ago, in my younger years, we'd go to parties around Hollywood and run into other C-listers. One of the things that sticks out to me, as a theatre kid myself, is that they are ALL the obnoxious, annoying theatre kids who sang Sondheim in the hallways and had a lot of feelings. They all had that energy. The parties would sometimes get really weird. And deep down, these are not the cool kids. I always remember that when people hold celebs up to these super high standards and take political and life advice from them. They're just people. They're the theatre kid from school, and everyone needs to calm down.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/aqibspeaks/what-type-of-best-friend-are-you)
2. ""I make movies and TV for a living. There are definitely differences between actors and 'movie stars.' Most actors are just normal, everyday humans that you wouldn't pick out of a crowd. They're usually quirky as hell, but just people. Movie stars tend to have a very specific charisma and a way about them that sets them apart. For example, my boss (who is a producer and has worked with tons of actors at all levels) went to George Clooney's for a meeting and said that it was hard not to feel starstruck because he made you feel like you had his full attention and you were the only one that mattered when he was speaking to you.""
3. ""You'd be surprised at the bad hygiene and bad teeth on a lot of celebs, especially dudes. Also, there are lots of filthy mansions with pets using the floor as a pee pad. A lot of cars, clothes, and houses are borrowed from actual rich people who want proximity to celebrities. I can't emphasize enough how filthy some of these people are — like they've had no home training.""
4. Relatedly..."" Been in LA a long time, known or aquatinted with lots of A-D list peeps, and many of those houses look like a college student's first apartment inside. Like, it's shocking. Also, no concept of money; they'll hand you a hundred-dollar bill for your valet. Having said that, most are really nice golden retriever types who are just blissfully ignorant of the real world. I've only met one or two genuine assholes.""
5. ""The Cyrus family is a lot more normal than people think. I won't go into detail about how I know (out of respect for the family member, a sibling of Miley), but the media really seemed to completely fuck Miley over the years. They are about as down-to-earth and normal as you could get. They each have their quirks, but they aren't the unstable, chaotic family some think they are. They never have been.""
6. ""Just because they worked with other celebs doesn't necessarily mean they were friends with those people. I have one friend who is very famous in his niche section of media. I've been asked, 'What does he say about ____/What does he say ____ is really like' (meaning other famous people he's worked with) for many years. I have to tell people that he doesn't actually talk about those people...at all. He's mentioned a couple of his coworkers who he's close to, but most of them never come up in conversation, and he's not friends with all of them. No one really expects us normies to be besties with people we worked with years ago, but we often assume celebs are BFFs with their costars, and often they just aren't. There may be no feud or bad blood, but they just aren't friends.""
7. ""I used to be neighbors with a lot of actresses, singers, etc. ... Despite their kids never having to work a day in their lives, a lot of them were very anxious parents. Their kids had to take a million special classes, were on weight and exercise regimes in elementary school, and had continuous psychiatric help throughout their lives from toddlerhood, etc. There were a lot of micromanaged kids, but the parents didn't seem mean — just very, very worried. I would've thought they'd have cared less since the kids are automatically semi-famous and obviously rich.""
8. [""I worked for one very long day on Batman Vs Superman. In between takes, my friend and I had a few minutes to talk with Zach Snyder, thanking him for the invite to come be in the film (he'd called into the sports radio station he was listening to locally while in town and offered extra roles to people at the station…I'm just the lucky friend of one). It wasn't like we knew the guy or anything, but for a few minutes, we were just chopping it up with another guy about sports…right after walking by the goddamned Batcave set! In hindsight, we both felt like maybe it wasn't so acceptable for a couple of extras to grab the director of a big-budget movie during a night shoot and just attempt to chit-chat with the guy, but he never made us feel like we were out of line or bugging him. He seemed genuinely happy we'd taken him up on the offer…and I even made it in the movie for like 1.2 seconds.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/iconic-duos)
9. ""People really need to stop pretending like celebrities are the personas they portray on red carpets, in interviews, etc. Most of the actors I've worked with are noticeably different from how they behave in the public sphere, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. It's normal to not want to share every part of yourself with the public. A lot of them are a lot more weird, introverted, etc. than you would think based on their public appearances. I just hate when people see videos of their favorite celeb and think they know them cause they were kooky on an episode of Hot Ones. The truth is they're still usually playing a version of themselves.""
10. [For example...""Owen Wilson is one of the most introverted people I've ever met. He turns it ON for the camera and then goes to his chair and totally keeps to himself.

11. ""A ton of athletes smoked weed before it was taken off the banned substances list in most leagues (and a good amount do harder shit as well). The guys who got caught were just dumb about it.""
12. ""I bartended in NYC for years, mostly in pretty humble, unpretentious bars (nothing I'd really classify as a dive). One bar in the East Village would get celebrity customers pretty often, probably because of its location and because it is a dark little place that would allow someone to go under the radar. The most striking thing to me was how goddamn awkward they tended to be. Like, they seemed so unsure of how to speak normally to a non-famous person. Often, I wouldn't even recognize them as celebrities until I interacted with them. They'd behave so awkwardly that I'd carefully look at the name on their card to find out who they were, and only then would the penny drop (or after some discreet googling). I can understand why they're like this, by the way. It's just funny how un-smooth many of these people act when they have such a cool public persona.""
13. [""I've known Jack Antonoff since before his big come-up, and he is genuinely one of the nicest, kindest, most hard-working people in the industry. He is truly a really, really good guy who deserves all of his success. I don't love every person he's worked with, and I wish he would disconnect from some of the...not as good people, but he really is the best.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/laurengarafano/celebs-turning-40-in-2024)
14. [""They are all frozen at the age they became famous. Christina Aguilera was always a 13-year-old girl. Adam Levine is a horny 18-year-old guy. Robin Williams was a hilarious and kind 25-year-old. etc…I think after you are famous, the systems around you stop saying 'no,' and stop supporting/disciplining you like they probably should. So, continuing to mature on the same path as normal people becomes harder.

15. ""I worked at a large celebrity PR agency in New York City. I feel like it could go either way — you have someone who is really great and grounded, or you have someone who is a complete nightmare and disaster. I had 12 celebrity clients I had to juggle. Some of these clients ranged from an A-list Stranger Things actor to a talk show host, and I learned a lot about the industry and how these people literally wear masks and know exactly how to display themselves on camera so that people will eat it up. ... It's wild to really see it happen in real-time. One celebrity, in particular, was a literal nightmare and one of the most insufferable women I have ever met. People in the United States LOVE her; she's basically America's sweetheart. She would not make eye contact with me, would not speak to me, and spoke to her assistant in front of me directly about what she wanted to communicate with me while I was RIGHT IN THE ROOM.""
16. ""One of my husband's best friends worked for Tommy Lee Jones on his cattle/polo ranch near San Saba. As I understand it, Jones is known in Hollywood for being a bit of a jerk. But my husband's friend said that TLJ is very reserved and private and honestly pretty socially awkward. He doesn't like to talk about himself at all but will happily discuss cattle breeds or what kind of polo saddle is best. His opinion is TLJ's awkwardness is what's given him his reputation.""
17. ""The B/C listers are the worst to work with.""
18. Specifically...""As someone who lives in Vancouver, I can confirm there is almost nobody worse than a C (and maybe temporarily B, if they're lucky) list CW actor. A few of them are truly great people who treat the crew and locals great. But the majority of them are awful — I'm saying this from my and my family's experiences working on set for the duration of the shows. In contrast, most of the A-listers I've met or my family has worked with have been incredible, genuine, and down to earth. They treated cast, crew, and locals miles better than C listers.""
19. In contrast...""Not me but a friend of mine worked on the set of Queen Charlotte (the Bridgerton series on Netflix). Had nothing but great things to say about the cast. She especially loved India (the lead actress). India was only about 20, I think, while filming, but she said she was so professional, kind, hardworking, and just an overall joy. My friend is in her late 20s. She said what she found super funny was that several of the male extras had the biggest crush on India, and it was like she was oblivious to it. She was probably just so focused on her work, and it was a lot of pressure leading a multimillion-dollar production, but I just found that funny. Stars…they can be clueless just like us.""
20. ""A lot of them are so insecure. There's one actor I worked with who is ADORED throughout their very fervent fandom. I met them at a season launch party, and while the party was ongoing, this one actor was schmoozing and gregarious and putting on the charisma. As soon as the party ended, he dropped the big smile and kept voicing complaint after complaint to his entourage. He kept trying to smell his own breath and was deeply concerned the garlic in the Caesar salad he had eaten was giving him bad breath, so he started breathing in the faces of all the folks in his entourage and asking everyone if his breath smelled okay.""
21. ""I went to college with a few nepo babies. Behavior ranged from typical wealthy apathy/cluelessness to actively trying to buy off people to keep their secrets. The one with the most famous parent was the most low-key and very kind.""
22. ""Will.i.am (black-eyed peas) is an extremely genuine person. He's wholesome, thoughtful, caring, and full of empathy. He doesn't have a mind for business, really; the people advising him lead him down the wrong path ethically. Personality: he is like a step below Bob Ross, Keanu, Steve Irwin, etc; not quite as wholesome, but he's up there.""
23. ""A lot of the men are very horny. I used to talk to this male actor from a Hulu show, and he was always snapping me during his sex parties. But anyways, yeah, he was always horny. They just have to hide it better. He first started talking to me after I messaged him on Instagram and told him I was a fan. He DMed me off a throwaway Instagram and added me on a throwaway snap.""
24. ""Kiss and intimate scenes (I know you want to know): it is true that it's not a romantic setting, and while some actors will switch on/off like that, others will joke around in a flirtatious way with their partner during the whole shoot, and that's very weird knowing they have a wife/husband at home.""
25. ""My parents used to work for one of the companies that supply Super Bowl memorabilia, and they got to meet Gisele Bundchen this way. She brought her kids to the booth where they were working before the game started so they could pick something out. The company's rep tried to give them everything, but she insisted on paying. My dad said she was very sweet and soft-spoken until a reporter caught up to her and started grilling her about Tom Brady. Her security was trying to get him to leave without putting his hands on him, and he was being rude. She flipped a switch and yelled at him that Brady was just one person on an entire team, that he worked very hard, and they needed to stop expecting him to do everything. As soon as the security team hauled the reporter off, she went back to sweet and kind person. My dad said it was like Jekyll and Hyde.""
26. ""Not me, but a close friend of mine was a nanny for a celebrity — she told me that the celebrity woman was very lonely and didn't feel she could trust anyone.

This is a huge generalization, but I never really got the feeling that a lot of them were 'intellectuals,' if you know what I mean. That being said, I met a few actors who were genuinely charismatic and appreciative of BG and the crew. I remember Sacha Baron Cohen was that kind of guy. He was genuinely very nice and pleasant.""
31. ""I dated someone who was barely C-list. He had been a TV personality since he was 15. He had zero accountability; all of his 'friends' were financial benefactors or ultra-wealthy. It was hard to be around someone who didn't understand that buying me expensive gifts didn't gloss over our issues. Truthfully, I feel bad for him. Even as little known as he was, we couldn't go anywhere without being interrupted. Within weeks of our breakup, a few of his best friends were shooting their shot.""
32. ""I've worked in Nashville, primarily in the music industry, since I was 18.

I can only speak for who I've worked with, so here's the skinny on all of 'em…Jack White is taller in person than you would think and is very down to earth. Loved spending time with him.

33. ""These people I'm going to talk about are all pretty much dead, but what the hell? In college and right after, I worked at a famous sporting event that would attract a bunch of celebrities.

I think he was not really wealthy because any time people said they liked something, he'd joke that he should have asked for more money.""
34. ""I've met a fair number of musicians, but probably the nicest was Weird Al. My daughter was shy but really wanted his autograph, and he was so kind! I understood why the line (after a show) was so slow. He took time with each person, made a little personal connection, and left them feeling seen and heard. It was honestly amazing.""
35. ""Many of them have really different natural voices from what you hear on camera. Reeeeaaally different.""
36. ""They REALLY look like that. From Victoria Secret supermodels, to A-list actors, to Grammy-winning musicians — they truly look that good. Yeah, I definitely had to catch my breath once or twice.""
37. Specifically...""Lee Pace is fucking beautiful in real life. Like jaw dropping, head turning, drop dead gorgeous. Lee Pace, if you're reading this, I apologize for gasping loudly and rudely staring at you that spring a couple of years ago. I'm genuinely sorry, but I couldn't help it because you stood out (it doesn't help you're so tall, too). 😭""
38. ""I work in TV, and I would just say, in general, that there is usually not any relationship between the character a person plays and how they actually are in real life. Sure, sometimes you get a writer-actor who is writing themselves, or maybe a really famous person who has a lot of control over the script, but that's not common. In general, they are their own distinct personalities who get a script written by a completely different set of humans. I know it's easy to feel like you know them or understand their relationship with their castmates, but you just don't. They are strangers you do not know.""

1hf5t5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/clep/comments/1hf5t5l/passed_intro_to_psych_with_a_69/,Passed intro to psych with a 69,"Hey everyone! 

A couple of days ago, I passed Intro to psych with a 69. I was helped by people who passed saying what they did to prepare for the exam on this subreddit, so I figured I'd pay it forward and write about how I prepared.

  
For the most part, I followed this person's study materials. [https://www.reddit.com/r/clep/comments/1bf88et/passed\_intro\_to\_psychology\_2024/](https://www.reddit.com/r/clep/comments/1bf88et/passed_intro_to_psychology_2024/)

I did all 12 quizlet sets mentioned in that post and read over the google docs. I transferred all the quizlets to knowt (which I would highly recommend because quizlet pay walls the learn function now and knowt does the exact same thing but for free). For my learning style, cramming videos doesn't really help, so I didn't really use modernstates or CrashCourse.

  
I was extremely paranoid about failing, so I probably over-studied. I did around 6-8 hours a day of studying for 5 days which was definitely over kill. I honestly probably could've passed (I only needed a 50) with about 3-4 hours of studying a day. My basic structure was to do the learn function on knowt until I knew all 12 sets by heart. I also did Petersons practice exams which helped me gauge my knowledge. I will say that the Peterson's exams are quite a bit harder than the actual CLEP exam, so don't be discouraged if you score low on them after studying a lot. After taking the Peterson's exams, I would look through and find whatever I didn't know/got wrong and create a separate knowt set on the information I was shaky on. Basically did that over and over until I was getting good scores on the practice exams. 

There are a ton of quizlets and a ton of terms, so once I got most of the information down, I went back and picked out all the stuff that I was struggling with remembering and made a separate set catered to my faults so that I wasn't wasting time studying a bunch of stuff I already had down. 

  
For the clep exam, knowing the information on a level deeper than just study-based word recognition is important. You have to be able to apply the concepts/theories/fields of study to situations. The way I did this without having to watch 8 hours of crash course videos was to just google and read about stuff I didn't fully understand. It sounds obvious but it really was a huge help to read a quick article/explanation of various stuff. 

  
Though I had studied a ton, I was still extremely nervous for the exam (I also pounded way too much coffee that morning which had me pretty on edge the whole time). I honestly thought the entire time that I was failing the exam, but I think that was just the nerves because I ended up doing really well. The exam itself had some random curveball questions about niche psychologists or experiments that I had never heard of before in my life which scared me a bit but that was only like a few questions. For the most part, not too bad/hard but you do need to really study especially if, like me, you know nothing about psych beforehand. 



quick summary of each day and what I did

Reading through the google docs is basically every day at some point or another. 

  
Day 1: Familiarizing myself with the material. Went over the 100 term quizlet in learn mode and did AP PSYCH quizlets unit 1-5

Day 2: went back over 100 term quizlet and did AP PSYCH unit 6-9 and the other two quizlets (FRQ and people/theories)

Day 3: Did All three Peterson's exams and created/studied quizlet for any missed questions and did a light bit of studying in between the exams

Day 4: Combined all the quizlets into one giant set and studied it over and over and over until I knew all the material by heart. This process also included creating my own separate quizlets for info I was struggling with. Retook Peterson's exams and started scoring well. This is when I felt more confident about the exam

Day 5 (exam day): This day I had about 4 hours of being awake before my exam started. I spent those 4 hours reading up on theories I was struggling with and vaguely going over the quizlets again. 

  
Remember to cater your studying experience to how you learn best to optimize your time and good luck on the exam! ",5,1734306422.0,clep,1,1.0,False

No physical assault but said a lot of stuff that made me feel ""dirty"". It will be lenghty

I was at the night shift at work, when this guy asked if I can sell him some alcohol. I recognized him as one of the important clients that has some connections to my boss, but he was really nice at first. Due to my autism I might be bad at reading people's intentions and panic in unfamiliar situations. At first, the conversation was casual, typical talk with tipsy person, and I wanted to be nice to someone important to my boss.

The thing is, I'm not used to men's attention - grew up ugly, still not conventionally attractive for most men. Usually keep interactions with clients short and polite. So when this guy started sayin that I'm pretty and really nice, I didn't pick up that something might go wrong. But between 'normal' small talk he started asking weird questions out of nowhere and then switching back to normal topics again. Then it turned into straight up sexual harassment (in non-chronological order, some of them repeated at least few times):

\- Asked me if I'll go with him for a weekend to have ""some fun"" and when I refused he was extatic, because for him it's a proof that I'm ""normal"" and don't seek connection just because he's rich. After that, he changed a tactic and wanted to go ""for a coffee"".

\- Asked repeadetely if he can go behind the counter and give me a kiss or a hug. In that moment I literally got scared to walk away and was afraid that he might try something if I turn back to him.

\- I got desperate and one point and straight up said that I'm a lesbian in commited relationship, he asked several times if me and my friend are open to a threesome for a free vacation.

\- He said stuff that shouldn't be said out loud. Private enough that they should stay between him and god, which made me super uncomfortable.

\- DOZEN of times said stuff that he would ""kidnap"" me from work, because he wants to see me in his fucking kitchen looking pretty for him, or ""jokingly"" asked if my ""close friend"" would be okay with him taking me away.

\- Complemented how sexy I was. Literally I could do the most mundane shit like getting hair out of my face and every time he said something along the lines ""please, do it again"" in this disgusting whispery tone.

\- Insinuated that the security guard is jealous of our ""connection"".

\- At the end he got even bolder and asked if I like spanking, that I look submissive and straight up offered few thousands for going into more secluded area to ""make me feel good"".

Fortunately, he finally went away, but now I feel disgusting. I hate myself for not picking up sooner until I was trapped, I hate how I kept smiling, I hate how he looked at me. But the most I hate this mother\*ucker. There's a high chance that he doesn't remember any of this and I'm left with awful memories, productivity drop at work and all these feelings my brain can't even begin to process. I hate how I can only talk with my supervisor, because my boss (woman) is also carieer oriented piece of sh\*t.

i've had problems with disordered eating habits in response to traumatic situations for years, namely in regards to not eating when i get stressed and temporarily associating food with getting screamed at and being unable to eat without almost throwing up. throughout middle school i drank entire pots of coffee before school everyday to suppress my appetite so that i wouldn't get hungry. i still do this every now and then, but not nearly as often.

i've hated looking at myself in the mirror for as long as i can remember(which is admittedly not very long, i have a lot of really big gaps in my memory), and a lot of it stems from my weight. i'm not necessarily overweight, but i'm what my mom has described as ""husky"". i'm 5'8 and around 160-170 pounds. my sister frequently makes comments about my weight when and if i eat something because she's 5'6 and less than 110 pounds so she likes to try and make comments about me for some reason.

based on the way i dress it's not easy to tell that i have a little extra weight because i wear baggy clothes that do a decent job of hiding my body.

i've tried working out which hasn't helped much because i build muscle easily but burning fat doesn't happen. i was on ozempic and that helped me drop 20-30 pounds because i used to be 190 not all too long ago.

i though i was getting better about not having as many issues with my weight and body, but im not. i almost cried today trying on a pair of pants because the size of pants i get didn't fit. i wear a 32/32 and i tried on a pair of levi's in that size and couldn't even button them up. i left the changing room to get a bigger size to try on but when i got out of there all i wanted to do was relapse. 

i've had problems with self harm in the past and i haven't wanted to hurt myself that badly in months. 

i just want to lose weight and get it off my body. i dont care how unhealthy it is i just want it gone. i've been looking into those liposuction things that actually remove the fat from your body permanently, but that would require asking my mom about it and having to explain this stuff to her, which is the last thing i wanna do.

do any of you know any fast and easy ways to lose weight? i dont care how unhealthy it is i just want options.

1hf5daw,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1hf5daw/would_this_coffee_gift_suffice/,Would this Coffee Gift suffice?,"Hi,

I’m a total coffee noob. I have absolutely zero knowledge here at all. But my Dad is looking to enter into the coffee world and start drinking something slightly better than McDonald’s coffee. He isn’t 100 percent sure he will have the patience or dedication to stick with it, so I don’t want to go crazy here. And he seems very set that he doesn’t want anything that will be too time consuming or “effort”. I apologise for the sacrilege. 

That being said, I’ve started looking at bean-to-cup style machines. I’m aware that these have quality issues and aren’t the best choice overall. But he currently has a cheap grinder and barely uses that as it is, so this seems like the better option for him right now until he becomes more invested down the line. 

So for an entry level machine: https://amzn.eu/d/ezub4pA what would you all think about this? 

Would this suffice? Are there any glaring issues that I’m missing? I was hoping to grab him some good quality beans and hope it helps him have a decent cup of coffee. 

Any advice or suggestions would be insanely appreciated. Thanks so much!

1hf5apq,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1hf5apq/worried_that_i_25m_make_people_uncomfortable/,Worried that I (25M) Make People Uncomfortable,"There was recently a situation where a friend (let's call her Christine), who is my roommate's (let's call him Gary) girlfriend, let me know that some compliments I made about her body made her uncomfortable, and that she needed to set a boundary with me. I completely understood this, and told her I would correct my actions and wouldn't say anything or do anything like that again. I told her I'd liked to have a conversation with her, we just couldn't get together with conflicting schedules before Thanksgiving break. 

Fast forward to last week, where we were at a party with all of our friends. I asked Christine if we could grab coffee to just discuss stuff and make sure we were good, and she enthusiastically agreed. Later on, after we had both been drinking, Christine asked if we could talk downstairs right then, and I was a bit surprised but said sure. She reiterated what she said in her text, but then brought up a bunch of other stuff. She brought up a joke I had made a couple years back about wanting to have sex with one of our friends (who is a girl). She also brought up how when we first met (around 2 years ago) we were playing a board game with another one of our friends (call her Sam) and I had made a comment about how her boyfriend Anthony was bi. I don't remember this, so I can't speak on the details of the context of it. Lastly, Christine brought up how she thought I was too close with Gary and that I hug him too much. This shocked me, as I really don't think I treat Gary differently than I do anybody else. This was all a lot to process, especially considering I wasn't sober and we were at a party. She acknowledged later that it wasn't the right place to bring all of that up, but that's besides the point. 

This conversation really, really hurt my feelings. She was bringing instances up that didn't involve her, but it felt like the intent was to hurt me, not to repair a relationship or provide an opportunity for atonement. For some context, one of my biggest insecurities growing up was having a friendship with straight men, as I was always worried they would just think I wanted to fuck them or that my friendship had an ulterior motive. I have always held hatred towards the stereotypical gay man who tries to convert his straight friends or preys on people in relationships. Today, I have friendships with many straight men (4 of which are some of my closest friends) and those friendships mean so much to me. Hearing everything she said really brought up some issues I have with my own sexuality, and the stereotypes that come with it. It's taken me a while to figure out how I feel, but mostly I've been very hurt.

Today, I had a conversation with Gary about this as it's been awkward in the house. I've felt really uncomfortable being around him, as I hate that my behavior has been seen as sexual or ""not innocent"" with him. I talked about that and he said that he's heard me say I like to ""convert straight men"" which is the exact opposite of how I feel and, as I've said, I have a strong moral issue with that mentality. I have no idea where he got that from, but I checked him on it and I told him how seriously I take that. He said he has no issues with me and he says I haven't crossed any boundaries with him and that he knows I am a good person. The issue is that Christine feels I have crossed a boundary in their relationship. I reiterated a lot of the points I made in my previous paragraph, but towards the end of the conversation, Gary brought up that apparently other people have felt uncomfortable by me before too. I suspect he means that I've made Sam uncomfortable, because I admit that sometimes Anthony, her boyfriend, has gotten touchy with me in the past (nothing more than a hug). I never stopped it, and maybe I should have, but I just didn't think anything of it. 

I currently am in a very horrible headspace. I have always expressed my love for my friends physically and verbally, and the times that people have let me know or expressed they don't like physical affection, I have always respected that. I pride myself on being a very intentional friend, and I have a lot of friendships that I care very deeply about, but I've never meant to make anyone uncomfortable. I have no idea how to move forward. What do I do?",1,1734304898.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

My hygiene overall is great, and the sweat doesn't stink at all its just sooo much. I've tried the like clinical don't sweat deodorant stuff, I've cut things out of my diet like coffee and stuff, I even went a stint *and avoided everyone* where I did no deodorant to see if that was the issue. 

Oddly enough, I sweat so much more when I'm cold vs when I'm hot. Like if I'm hot and heart rate is up it might just be like normal? But if I'm even slightly cold *which is always* my armpits are litterally pouring water like crying down my sides basically.

I don’t particularly enjoy revisiting the past. While I’m sure there are funny stories, festive moments,  or heartwarming sentiments, my mind goes into a panic because that’s not what initially pops up for me. I just get mad, and if there was a photo of me from back in the day one would assume the root of my anger were the fashion “choices” I made. I had a rotation of clothing, but the safest and my go to for the damp bleak rainy weather In Jackson Missouri was the following: my black and grey crocheted  (eww) horizontal patterned (equally eww) sweater, holey jeans, and black combat boots. Fortunately for me Jackson Missouri was no where near the fashion Capitol of the Midwest, and even if it was that would be the equivalent of having the least corruption in a third world country. The majority of peers came from humble beginnings and country like lifestyles, so considering the fact that I didn’t wear Camo on a daily basis made it look like I was prepping the cover of teen vogue. My shoes were a little on the small side, but essentially I had a uniform 5 days of the week. Outside of school I didn’t have much of a social life, I would get the occasional “we should have a sleep over” or “are you going to the Zach Ellison party this weekend” and if I played my cards right, the boy I was crushing on would even ask if I wanted to go see a movie or something. I would always come up with some kind of excuse as to why I couldn’t partake in the right of passage social norms everyone else seemed to enjoy. I’d either say I’m babysitting my younger brother, or that I was helping my family with a big extravagant dinner, or that my mom was really strict and conservative and forbade any teen romances. They didn’t know that I didn’t have a little brother, or that my mother was unaware of teen coming of age love stories that could have been mine, or that I had no family to attend some festive dinner party with. They didn’t know that I was a foster child.

Getting into public school was my primary goal once I landed in the shit hole named “blattel” group home. I knew eventually I would make it out of that town and on to bigger and grander ventures, but first I had to get the fuck out of that piece of shit flaurecently lit fascility and onto the runway of Jackson Highschool, even if it was for only 8 hours. The skinny on the group home is as follows: level 1: public education amongst other things was a privilege, therefore you were unable to attend public school and had to receive your education with inbound school with a tutor that came to the fascility, you were also unable to have condiments on your food, go outside for activities, have tv time, sit on the couch, speak at group meeting, which were held every day at 4 pm. If you were to speak in said meetings it was appointed by the group “leader” (side note if your getting cult vibes, then I’m painting this picture accurately) responding to upper levels was “mandatory” and they were encouraged to tell you what they thought about you, and it wasn’t often nice. These were angry teenage kids with a lot of trauma and resentment built up, and that was often times projected onto the only time they felt their voices truly mattered, onto the self image turned insecurities of the equally traumatized and often abandoned lower levels. After your behavior, appearance, effort or lack there of, or whatever topic was chosen that day to be  placed on the chopping block to be dissected for all those involved, you had to say “thank you for loving me enough to be honest with me.” A lot of times the fresh meat in the facility could not hold back their tears or emotions, which was a clear sign of weakness to the more seasoned veterans. I NEVER cried in groups or in that facility because I knew if I did I would never stop. I also had an unwavering belief and faith in myself that I would make it out, that I would live a happy life, and that I would NEVER look back. Nothing they, facility staff members, kids at school, or the group home manager Ms Mavis could say were capable of shaking the place in my heart that reserved and housed hope. Level 2 came with condiments on your food, outdoor activities, and were able to suggest group topics. But level 3 seemed like the ultimate liberation, on level 3 you got to watch movies, sit on the couch, lead the group sessions, but most importantly you got to go to public school! Raising levels was behavior based, and while my inner monologue certainly did not “choose kindness back then” I had a goal and my sights set. considering my peers in the fascility set the bar so low I knew within a matter of months the mishaps, physical fights, and mental breakdowns of everyone else there would be the runway lights to my ascension to the top of their ponzy like pyramid scheme.


 While I may have been considered a flirt by some, or promiscuous by others depending on you were asking, which was totally false, Jeff was my first love. His parents were pretty hardcore drug addicts and he became a ward of the state at the age of 9 and was apart of a different group home that sometimes we would have outings with if you were on level 3. While there may have been little flings simultaneously here and there with others on my end, and surely on his as well, I always reserved a special part of vulnerability for him, and I believe he did the same. We both attended Jackson high, and when my prison guard, I mean facility staff member, would drop me off at 7:15 I would enter the majestic brick buildings front doors, run through the hallway of lockers directly to the back door, past the football field and behind the gymnasium where I would meet up with Jeff for a morning chat and Newport . Jeff had buzzed hair and light green eyes. He was two years my senior with boyish facial features yet a manly aura around him.His uniform consisted of baggy grey sweat pants and reeboks with the straps, so I’d always sing the song that was popular at the time “baggy swag pants with the Reebok’s with the straps, with the straps!” This was before these brands became very in vogue and what the broke kids, I.e wards or the state with 100 dollar clothing vouchers for the YEAR could afford. We had almost a ritual Monday through Friday, we’d have a morning smoke together and often would exchange letters we had written each other, maybe not every time but often enough. Granted, maybe our connection was trauma based and made us take up residence in victimsville and wasn’t healthy, but at that point it was something. “ you know I’m Native American” Jeff said one dreary morning, passing me my  hot Carmel macchiato coffee with whole milk he would pick up for me, if he managed to get out of bed early enough. Taking my first swig and drag of my smoke I replied sarcastically “I’ll alert the media” , a quote from a movie called party monster starring Seth green and McCauley caulkin. Looking back maybe I wasn’t the nicest kid, but Jeff appreciated my humor. “Well like did you know if we were on a reservation they wouldn’t charge us rent, and the state couldn’t get us” ok while Jeff had a tough exterior he was also a little zanny, a quality I adored that I’m sure he only revealed to select people, and while I was blinded by hormones whenever he was around, I still had enough sense to take whatever he said with a grain of salt. “I’m not Native American” I replied “and I wouldn’t be caught dead on a reservation, you know a lot of them become alcoholics because the living conditions provided-“ “we could get married” he interjected. My heart sank. I had become pretty pessimistic at this point in my life, also I was 15 and for a variety of reasons Jeff and I getting married wouldn’t have been exactly legal if you catch my drift. I was also not the romantic one between the two of us, and I really didn’t want to have a whole dramatic showdown and listen to  another rant about how I didn’t really care about him, cause I did, but I believe now as an adult my coping mechanism back then was a belief in my future and an escape into my fantasies, while his was trying escape into a reality with me that ultimately I knew were nothing but fantasies, one of our dreams would have to give, and it wasn’t going to be mine. I finished my smoke and shrugged off what he had said and ran back to make second period. As my monotoned teacher started talking about, well I honestly couldn’t tell you, my mind started wandering about what life with Jeff would look like.  I wondered if he would work a job at Walmart or O’reillys, the two major employers of the god foresaken town. What the fuck would we live in, a TP? I didn’t know anything about Native American reservations, and I genuinely didn’t understand how Jeff who looked like a typical Missouri white boy, although more attractive, could get us into one. I decided Jeff’s fantasies were too depressing,unsatisfactory and simply would not do, so I began to construct a more ideal situation in the safe haven of my imagination. There I was not limited to the restraints of mine or his reality. I would become an actress, in my fantasies I didn’t really quite take into consideration what he would do, after all I was the one who put in the work of creating them , okay okay maybe I pictured him looking handsome in a tux and kissing me on a red carpet. I could picture the photographers yelling “ over the shoulder!” “Who are you wearing” “what are you wearing” as now we were able to afford the finest of fabrics and perfectly fitting shoes, their bulbs flashing and by proxy electrifying the nation, and how the fucks who mistreated, drugged, abandoned, and abused us would regret what they had done. They would see the value in us. I bought into this fantasy all day mainly living in my own head and avoiding Jeff like the plague, but the moment I got picked up by one of the fascility staff members the waves of my imagination crashed into the shores of my reality. “Ms. Mavis found your and Jeff’s letters, so be ready for that”. The staff member proudly stated julting me back into my body where I acutely became aware of my senses. My heart was in my throat and my mouth was dry, I wanted to say something and defend myself but was paralyzed in fear. When you are a ward of the state, the things you say and do have to be calculated, because as bad as blattle was, it was still miles above previous fascilitys I had been in, and they could put me back in wherever, whenever with a flick of their pen. I road home in silence, awaiting the consequences for having a pen pal courtship with a boy from a familiar background. 

Subsequently,  they decided an appropriate punishment would be to humiliate  me by having me witness the violation of my private thoughts that I only dare exchanged with the one person I felt I could trust being read word for word in our group meeting while the upper levels vocalized their disdain for my actions and I sat there powerless, saying “thank you for loving me enough to be honest with me” I was then dropped down to level 1,  and I never made it back to level 3 before I was transferred to another fascility, and I never saw Jeff again.

As always, I read a couple magazines and am here to talk about them. 

# Clarkesworld

The December 2024 issue of *Clarkesworld* had a wonderfully international flavor, with nine stories written by authors from eight different countries. This wasn’t a themed issue or anything, just a display of how much excellent science fiction is being written from around the globe. 

The issue starts with **Stranger Seas Than These** by L. Chan, an author with a reputation for strange and beautiful stories, but one I’ve sometimes struggled to connect to in the past. But “strange and beautiful” certainly describes this tale of a life-threatening catastrophe on a deep sea dive to study the remains of leviathans worshipped by a significant interplanetary faction. It’s not a story to put a neat bow on everything, but it’s gripping both for the characters and the plot. 

**From Across Time** by Chisom Umeh features a woman repeatedly watching a video from a time-traveling lover she cannot at all remember, slowly piecing together bits of message to uncover just what was lost—and the ways she can respond. 

**The Painted Skin and the Final Stroke** by Zhu Yixuan occupies a liminal space between sci-fi and fantasy, with a city overrun by ghosts, at least some of which appear to have technological origin. The narrator is a painter who seeks to be able to capture the soul in a painting—something only human artists are thought to be capable of. But can one paint a soul when one’s subject is a ghost? 

**Souljacker** by Shari Paul is a tense story of a woman who rents out her body to rich clients seeking experiences they couldn’t have in their own skin, only to find she’s been repeatedly rented by the same person who had ruined her life years before. What follows is an immersive and thrilling tale, with the threat of arrest—or worse—looming over the whole thing. I would’ve liked to see more followup on some of the subplots introduced late in the story, even if the lead’s plot line resolves. This is a good short story, but I think it might’ve made an even better novelette. 

The one actual novelette in the issue is **Lucie Loves Neutrons and the Good Samarium** by Thoraiya Dyer, simultaneously a scientific research story and one of love and parenthood in a world facing dire water shortages and constant threat of nuclear strikes. While the two stories mutually support each other, the interpersonal plot feels like the main one for most of the way, with the research storyline developing a little bit too quickly in the late stages. 

In my eyes, the biggest highlight of the issue is **Driver** by Sameem Siddiqui, in which an aging driver laments the cold and ungrateful treatment of so many of his customers, interspersed both with recollections of past acquaintances told in second person to a series of absent interlocutors and with present jobs for a strange customer with confusing instructions. It makes for a disorienting, nonlinear narrative, but the lead’s voice truly stands out, and the slow-developing plot supplements it wonderfully. This one is excellent. 

The other highlight of the issue is **The Coffee Machine** by Celia Corral-Vázquez, translated by Sue Burke. It’s not as ambitious as “Driver,” but it’s just plain fun, telling of the ill-fated time that campus appliances became self-aware. It’s a lighthearted and farcical tale that’s nearly impossible to read without smiling. 

**Life Sentence** by Gelian, translated by Blake Stone-Banks, is a *Groundhog Day*\-style time loop story in which an astronaut repeatedly tries to save his lover from being lost in a black hole. While the character focus is not quite as tight, this reminds me of “Souljacker” in the way that it ratchets up the tension very early and keeps it high for the duration of a riveting tale. 

Finally, **Retirement Plan** by Paul Starkey tells of a longhaul spacer returning home anxious to see how an audacious retirement scheme had developed over his centuries of absence. Mostly a scheming story with a hint of “be careful what you wish for,” it’s a light and entertaining capper to the issue. 

The nonfiction includes a pair of art pieces—an editorial on the various cover artists of *Clarkesworld* and an interview with decorated genre artist Donato Giancola. Additionally, D.A. Xiaolin Spires completed her two-part series on martial arts in zero gravity, and an interview with author Erin K. Wagner put yet another book on my TBR. 

# GigaNotoSaurus 

Like they did last year, *GigaNotoSaurus* closes out a year of long short fiction with a light, entertaining novelette, in this case **Dead reckoning in 6/8 time** by Sabrina Vourvoulias. For all that it features a complicated mother/daughter relationship and souls at risk of being lost to the Devil, the focus on community, solidarity, and a whole lot of Mexican folk music—in this case son jarocho, a regional style from the state of Veracruz—make for a thoroughly entertaining comfort read. Make no mistake, there are plenty of tense moments, but this is a less individualistic, more dance-heavy cousin to “The Devil Went Down to Georgia.” It’s a ton of fun.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

Just got my Vertuo Plus a few weeks ago and it’s completely changed the game for my morning coffee, I’m actually in love.

My question is: has anyone here experimented with mixing single and double espresso pods for milk drinks together? I usually have a latte with a double shot of espresso and that is perfectly fine, but for the days I know I’ll need something a little extra I wanted to try making a triple shot latte using one double pod and one single pod. I think 2 doubles would be too much except for extreme occasions lol.

If anyone has tried this, do you have specific combos that you think work well and don’t clash with each other? My initial hunch would be to mix pods of similar intensities, for example DE Dolce with Orafio. For reference, I do prefer these pods that have middle intensity roasts.

1hf4ww7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hf4ww7/does_she_want_to_be_friends_or_date/,does she want to be friends or date?,"I met this lady, we're the same age 25 and we've went out together twice. First time we went out we had coffee and hung out for 4 hours and then the second was yesterday.

Yesterday we went to a nearby city, checked out a museum wandered around the city and grabbed some dinner, altogether it was like 7 hours and honestly it was an amazing time, spoke about a lot and had so many laughs its the funniest date I've been on.

  
When I dropped her off I said I had a great time and I said I like her and would like to continue to see each other - maybe I shouldn't have I like her but I said it and it is what it is.

  
Here's the kicker, she said that I am 'hilarious' and a 'handsome guy' and enjoys hanging out with me, but the last few months have been tough (didn't elaborate why) and isn't sure what she wants and doesn't want to get into a relationship yet.

  
I said I understand and that I don't want to be jumping into relationship either, but would like to continue to hang out, take things slow and see what happens, and she responded with sorry if it wasn't the answer I was hoping for and to text her when I get home, so I did and said thanks for such a great time and I hope to see her soon.

  
This morning she messaged me just saying hey and asking what I'm up to so clearly thought of me.

Now I don't know where I stand because I don't know how to continue whatever this is?",0,1734303769.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False

The rest of the internet: LOL BAD VOICE ACTING, IT'S SO CHEESY

Look; the original Japanese dialogue is a lot clearer in its message IMO but that's like choosing between Haagen Dazs strawberry and Haagen Dazs coffee. They're BOTH good.

""Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.""
And Dracula's response? ""What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets."" He says so much in just one line: 
1. Humanity is too consumed by shame and hate to truly live freely and legitimately. Mankind, despite its goodness, has too many depraved people for the good to outweigh the bad, or perhaps, too many good people doing nothing when the time comes for them to step up and do the right thing even if at their own personal expense, which at that point are they even good people if they choose not to be? Lisa tried living that way and humanity in its stupidity, killed her for it. His perspective is that good people often have to hide their good nature because those people will always be silenced by humanity's worst examples. In a world in which honesty and earnesty is punished more so than met with rewarding and understanding, Dracula doesn't NEED to hide his true nature, he doesn't need to hide anything at all. He is an irredeemable force of hatred and he isn't ashamed of it, doesn't hide it. Or to reference the Japanese script; Might is the one and only force in this world, and by might, he rules. But mankind? An ouroboric paradoxical blight which advocates for good yet rewards evil deeds and thus goodness hides while evil shines in the light of day; a miserable little pile of secrets.
2. ""Mankind ill needs a savior such as you"", and his response is to damn humanity altogether. To him mankind does not need a savior because mankind is beyond salvation, mankind is doomed, by Dracula's agency or not. He's not the culprit, he's just the messenger and symbol of humanity's avarice, a twisted mirror of their nature, a dark messiah who decrees that damnation is their one and only redemption.
3. And if we're getting on the line delivery? His tone of voice considers humanity's salvation as an absurd, ridiculous concept concept. He's completely detached to the idea that he states his thesis of humanity as a matter of fact. Overdramatic? When you're determining the fate of an entire race, no, there is no such thing as being overdramatic.

Meanwhile the internet pokes fun at this exchange as if it was some sort of goof troop zanytown wackiness. But I just cannot see it that way at all. Both the Japanese and English scripts are two approaches to saying the same thing and they're valid in different ways, but what they are NOT is goofy/cheesy/overdramatic or ""bad"".",46,1734303742.0,castlevania,15,0.95,False

After some time I noticed that my american dream wasn't really what I expected. There's things that I like here but there is more things that I dislike here that I miss from my home.

Lately I have been homesick - means every day I count down the days to go home, try to keep myself motivated with the things and trips I've planned the next months. Trying to push through and keep meeting my aupair friends, go out for a coffee or to the gym etc.
I feel like the only thing I'm doing is just waiting for this year to finally be over! But isn't this year to just be enjoyed?

The last 2 weeks my boyfriend from home  came over for a visit and even though we had a wonderful time together, I had a lot of downs because I knew this ""piece of my home"" is going to leave again soon and the only wish I had is going back with him.

Yesterday he left and I feel nothing but lost and in pain. I've been crying the whole time, even went to a friends gathering yesterday where I talked to them about it. But it simply doesn't help. 

I feel like this program isn't for me. Being far away from home for 1 year...I can't handle it, I realized now. In the town I live there is nothing to do. Going on weekend trips within the US is MUCH more expensive than I expected.

I'm 25 yrs old, I have a lot of experience in solo traveling around the world but never felt this homesick before! I came from a fulltime job with a solid income & I quit everything just to make my dream come true but now the only thing I wanna do is go home. The fact that its getting colder now and XMAS is ahead only adds up to my dark feelings...

My hostfamily has been nothing but generous, nice and understanding since day one! They do make me feel part of the family and want to take me on several vacations next year. I'm already worried about it because on the last trip I experienced that being 24/7 with ""strangers"" and 3 kids without time for myself was just making me mentally sick.

I'm their first aupair and I'm so grateful for everything that they did for me, I know they invested a lot of money too. But I simply don't enjoy my day to day life here anymore....even though my schedule and tasks are really easy and laid back. 

They never asked me how I am feeling to be far away from home. Today I cried the first time in front of their eyes and told them that I am really homesick.

What can I do? I feel like I just wanna tell them what's been going on with me for the last months & hope they'd understand if I decided to go back home. I've been feeling like this for more than a month now - so at what point can you say it's not a phase anymore?

I was working in warehouse few months ago and I was picking up and packaging orders.

We did have time deadline when every package needed to be prepared for the UPS driver.

In my first day, my task was to pack about 600 packages and I did that before deadline while other experienced workers was still working.

The owner of the warehouse told me that I am talented that I did this task so fast before deadline and told me I can go for cigarette/coffee break so I went on coffee and when I came back the shift-leader was angry on me for no reason and he gave me some unnecessary tasks.

Second day I again packed the orders before deadline so I went for coffee, cigarette or chat with other workers and he come to me and told me: So you do nothing right now heh? And he was mad and told me if I have nothing to do I can go clean floor or pick up trash when other workers was on their phones and on cigarette break.

Third day I got angry and I told him to stop targeting me that other workers when they have their job done they can relax and I cannot. He just said that he is sorry because he was not expecting me to get angry.

When I was doing my job he was observing me and he was looking for little mistakes and always trying to ""help"" me. These mistakes was not even mistakes. Example: he told me to use 4 layers of sticky tape on small box instead of 2 so the box will not open.

Everyone was using 2 layers so I did copy other workers and he told them nothing because it was his friends.

Or.. I was picking up orders and I was marking picked items with pencil and he told me it is better to do it for pen because it is better, which is total non-sense.

I told this to the owner that he is observing me and he is getting angry and screaming on me for made up mistakes and owner told me that I need to¨get used to his personality..

What do you think was actually hapenning with him? One hour he was so kind to me and then next hour he was mad on me for ""mistakes"" that he made up.. He never approached other workers with his made up mistakes that he was observing in my working process.

After 4 months the owner approached me and told me that I am fired because shift-leader doesnt wish me on workplace because I am ruining his mode which have negative effect on other collagues :D",1,1734303537.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False
