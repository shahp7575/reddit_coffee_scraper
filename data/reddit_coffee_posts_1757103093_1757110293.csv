Didn’t sleep much last night. Coffee this morning tasted like seawater, which feels like poetic justice for a man who spends his life writing about shipwrecks.

Got a call from Aunt Ruth. She says my father’s been moved into hospice. The phrase she used was “it’s time to come home.” Home. I haven’t used that word for years, not for there.

Apparently, he’s not speaking much. Won’t eat. She says I should come while he’s still “aware.” Aware of what, exactly? That his son is a stranger? That he told me at twelve to stop crying at Mom’s funeral and I’ve been obediently silent ever since?

I booked the ticket anyway. Out of duty, I suppose. Or guilt. Hard to tell the difference.

In maritime records, captains always log the last known course of a ship before it vanishes. Latitude, longitude, tonnage, number of crew. Cold, exacting details right before the silence. This feels the same. A neat little entry before everything sinks.

I don’t know what I’ll say to him. Maybe nothing. Maybe the silence will be enough.

However, I still have them and I'm not sure if I'm just impatient or there's something I need to change. Here are my steps: 

1. Exfoliating before a shower, either with a dry brush or ogx coffee scrub and a loofah 

2. Using naturium salicylic perfector body wash 

3. Amlactin lotion after getting out (which burns like hell but I heard it works so I make my myself use it anyway, lol)

[My MIL is trying to seduce me and I can't take it anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/10wp8ew/my_mil_is_trying_to_seduce_me_and_i_cant_take_it/)**, Posted February 8th, 2023.**

Throwaway because obviously

I(34M) have been married to my wife (24F) for about 2 years. My wife didn't have a good relationship with her mother(39F) growing up and has called her by many names including Maneater, One drink whore, Town's favourite slut and a lot worse.

About a year ago, we talked about having kids and she wasn't completely onboard with the idea even though she wanted kids. After discussing it with her therapist, my wife decided to at least try to have some sort of relationship with her mother. At the time, MIL was homeless and was crashing on different couches if not sleeping with someone. MIL convinced my wife to let her stay at our place for a few weeks as it would be easier for them to hash things out.

I didn't like the idea but agreed because my wife wanted it. She also assured me that she would kick her mother out if she does anything out of line. My wife also barred her from bringing any of her partners into our home. I work from home and my wife works from her office, so I have spent a lot more time with MIL than my wife has.

MIL is a very different person from my wife. My wife is very conservative, gracious and well mannered. MIL is a slob who doesn't like to put on clothes. MIL mostly hangs out in her lingerie (not ordinary underwear) most of the time and doesn't like covering up for anybody. My wife spends a lot of effort in dressing up at home even if she has no plans to go out or meet anyone.

My wife asked me to ignore MIL's behaviour because my wife isn't interested in changing her mother's behaviour just repairing their relationship.

Soon weeks became months and my wife and MIL did get closer. During the same time, I had to put up seeing her naked every morning when she makes her coffee, a lot of inappropriate touching and contact between me and MIL, a lot of dirty talk and cringeworthy suggestions about my relationship with my wife and general lack of boundaries shown by MIL. At the same time, my wife has picked some of MIL's habits like wearing underwear around the house and has been more sexually proactive than before.

My wife always defended her mother and asked me to just tolerate her for a ""little more time"". I used to tell my wife everything that her mother would do to me but eventually she knew what was happening and stopped discussing it. On many occasions, MIL has explicitly stated her desire to hookup with me among a lot of other sexual desires.

Last week, I woke up to loud sounds coming from the living room in the middle of the night. I went out to find MIL pleasuring herself on the couch while porn played on the TV. I should have left immediately but I stayed to watch. Eventually our eyes met and kept the eye contact till she finished. I wasn't sure how to tell my wife about it so I didn't mention it to her. Since then, MIL has been way more aggressive with her sexual advances and suggestions, often rubbing her body against mine under various pretense. I have talked to my wife about getting MIL a different place and she has asked me for another month.

Yesterday while I was working, MIL walked into my home office naked and forcibly sat on my lap and forced her tongue down my neck. I felt really aroused and MIL gave me a ""hand"" with my erection and I didn't resist. She then proceeded to go to my bedroom and called me to join her. I was ashamed of what happened and just left the apartment. I came back after my wife returned. I haven't told her about this but I can't take it anymore. I am uncomfortable with MIL's advances and feel disgusted with what happened between us.

[(Update) My MIL is trying to seduce me..](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/10wvcpy/update_my_mil_is_trying_to_seduce_me/)**, Posted February 9th, 2023.**

I told my wife everything that happened, everything I felt and how I screwed up. She was shocked and shattered. She started sobbing and when I tried to console her, she told me to leave her alone. She told me that she was disgusted just looking at me.

I packed up some of my stuff and left. I will be staying in a hotel for a few days.

[(Update 2) My MIL seduced me....](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/10xn9kf/update_2_my_mil_seduced_me/)**, Posted February 9th, 2023.**

After I left home yesterday, my wife kept calling and texting me. Initially I didn't reply but later in a text she threatened to kill herself if I didn't tell her where I was. I told her I was at a hotel and needed some space to think about what happened. She showed up at the hotel and knocked on my room, I didn't let her in and told her to go home. She insisted she won't go home without me and proceeded to make a scene outside the room, I had to let her in to get her to stop. Even the hotel security showed up but left us after they realised the situation.

She kept crying and sobbing while getting a few words in like ""I love you.....Why her?....Was I not enough?..... Come back.... How could you?..... You are sick..... Love me..... She is not good for you..... I did everything you wanted""

It killed me to see her in that state. Eventually I got her to stop crying. I told her my side of the story and how I felt alone without her support at home. I explained that I have always loved her and I never liked her mother. I told her why I didn't do anything about her mother because I trusted my wife to make the right decisions for us. I explained to her that I have felt betrayed because my wife never understood what I was going through.

She then flipped everything on me, saying I had stopped asking about her day and only complained about her mother. She said I could have kicked her mother out if I didn't like it. She talked about how I used to bring her breakfast in bed and that I hadn't done it in a year. I broke down crying hearing all of it. She kept saying that I should come back home and she would make it all good again. She said she kicked her mother out.

I asked for more time but she started crying again. I held firm asking her to leave or I would go to a different hotel. When she finally left, I had to stop myself from going after her, I didn't want her to go out in the state she was in. I kept checking on the door security at home to make sure she reached home safe. When she did, my heart sank seeing her mother with her.

She keeps texting me every hour asking if I am ready to come back. Keeps repeating that she can make it all better for us.

I know she is delusional to think that we can go back to what we had. I don't know if I want to be with her again. She can take whatever she wants and go live with her mother.

Edit: I am done with my life

🎭 Banquet Odyssey — chaotic parody. The Meta Chorus (Rick, Morty, Pim, Charlie) pratfall through Scooby-Doo mansions, Shrek swamps, and Star Wars cantinas. Satire isn’t distraction — it’s revelation.

✨ Starlight Commons — quiet catharsis. Neon diners, Tuesday-night coffee, Batman brooding in a booth, SpongeBob at a crosswalk, Courage trembling under streetlights. Eternity reframed as the ordinary that endures.

Setting: Unknown sector

Date: Around May, 1995





(Wet applause echoes down the hallway. Alex turns, searching the halls for the source. At first, he sees nothing. Then, the air itself seems to thicken, amber syrup bleeding through the cracks in the wall, pooling at the floor. It rolls around, gathering mass, and weaving itself into a vaguely human silhouette.)



(The syrup creature stands before him, taller than before. Its torso shimmering with gold and amber. Its “skin” is a shifting tapestry, every second rearranging. Cheekbones hardening, faces emerging, only to dissolve. Eyes and mouths forming, only to be replaced by new ones. Dozens of voices whisper from within the translucent form.)



Alex: What the hell do you want from me?



(The syrupy pool rises and falls. Every second, a new face takes form. Some eager to claim a moment of existence. Some child-like, some full of malice, and some full of kindness. But all of them, focused solely on Alex. The syrupy body convulses, bubbling from underneath the surface as one of the faces slowly takes form. The syrup drains upward, pulling themselves into impossible curves, until the creature’s body morphs into a playful, and all too familiar grin.)



Jester: Bravo! Bravo! A marvelous performance.



(She continues a rapid round of applause, her form still slowly shifting into her diamond-patterned dress. Black diamonds glistening with a wet sheen. And her hair crystallizes into a ribbon of gold-streaked curls. A pout forms at her lips, gazing at him with piercing blue and yellow eyes.)



Jester: You’re the star of the show. Why have you not taken a bow, now that the curtains have drawn?



(She takes a step forward, running a hand through his hair. Alex is disgusted, but too tired to run away anymore.)



Jester: It makes it hard to stay excited, when you look so… unsatisfied at the story’s climax.



(The Jester’s form shudders, her outline being lost within the shifting liquid. Her grin wavers, her diamond dress slowly drains of color. Her body deflates, slumping forward as the remaining color drains from her face. Lines begin to form on her face deepen, until her cheekbones protrude, making her face look hollow. The new face looks down at him, the corners of their lips twisting into a look of pure disgust.)



(Slowly, the figure straightens its posture, face sharpened by disdain. The eyes are piercing, heavy-lidded, and looking down their nose at Alex.)



New voice (contemptuous): You could hardly call that a climax. The whole thing was terribly predictable.



(The figure spits a thin line of syrup on the carpet, filling the air with the smell of old vinegar. The syrupy mass recoils, straightens, until it forms into the body of a thin woman. Her hair is drawn so far back, her scalp must be in pain from the tension.)



Contemptuous voice: Another fool, fueled by a sense of self-righteousness. And another protagonist that’s labeled themself a hero.



(She glances down at the cooling corpse of the hollow-faced creature, nostrils flaring as if she can’t stand the sight of it. Her eyes flicker back to Alex with a cool assessment.)



Contemptuous voice: But no matter how you feel, you’re no hero. You’re weak. And someday, that weakness of yours will be your undoing.



(The figure shakes her head, before disappearing into a swarm of syrup, the sour vinegar leaving with her. The syrupy mass swells again, as another shape pushes to the surface. The air fills with the scent of freshly cut grass and rain. The figure that emerges is sturdy, with broad shoulders and calloused hands. His eyes are deep, his gaze both gentle and stern. He stands before Alex, looking down at him, like a father ready to rebuke their child.)



New voice (fatherly): You’re mistaking stubbornness for bravery, Alex. There’s more strength found in letting go, than there is in holding on to every lost cause.



(He crouches down, his gaze heavy but not unkind.)



Fatherly voice: There’s more options to fight for another’s sake, than suffering in their place. Tell me, who was it that taught you to place the world’s pain above your own?



(He waits for a reply, but Alex’s throat is too raw for words. The scent thickens, almost choking Alex with fragrance of nostalgia and home.)



Fatherly voice: I can see it in your eyes. You ache, hoping a day comes where someone will tell you it’s ok to stop. But no one will, son. Not in this place.



(The man stands, and as he does, the grass and rain smell dries up, leaving behind a biting whiff of iron, and blood. The syrup form shudders, thinning and stretching, limbs growing lean and restless. The next creature is a scrawny woman, that looks like the spitting image of Elliot.)



New voice (paranoid): You can’t trust… not with those friends of yours. There’s too many secrets… too many….



(She bites her fingernails, restlessly glancing over her shoulder every time a shadow flickers behind her.)



Paranoid voice: You need to run. Before it’s too late. Don’t give them a chance to pull out the knives they’ve been hiding behind their backs.



(She lurches closer, eyes wide.)



Paranoid voice: Stay awake! Stay ready! You can only trust yourself!



(The panicked face slowly melds back into the syrup, like a bursting bubble too unstable to hold form. A fresh wave of heat radiates outward, the smell of hot iron making Alex’s eyes water. The mass contracts, its outline hardening as the syrup pulls tight. Twisting into the form of a lean, muscular man. The man’s fists are balled so tightly, his knuckles are devoid of any color. He looks down at Alex’s trembling form through slitted eyes that burn with unspoken fury.)



New voice (angry): I should kill you right now, Alex.



(Every step he takes forward causes the yellow wallpaper to curl at the corners, smoldering under the heat of an invisible fire.)



Angry voice: You pressed a button, pretending it was mercy. But it wasn’t. It was about your pain. It was about how you felt. Not that thing.



(He lunges, grabbing Alex by the collar and yanking him close.)



Angry voice: You’re not a savior. You’re a murderer. Its blood is on your hands. And the only reason you spilled it in the first place, you’d rather that than spill your own tears.



Alex: Get… get off me.



(Alex struggles, but the grip is too strong.)



Angry voice (trembling): Hatred is the only justification for murder. Not some half-assed— 



(The lights above them flicker violently, sparks shooting out of the sockets, the wallpaper blistering under the heat of the figure’s anger. The anger boring into Alex’s skull is personal. And ready to consume him.)



Angry voice: I should tear you apart right now! Just looking at you makes me so— 



(The man’s voice cuts off once more as another bout of anger tears through him. Alex can feel the grip on his collar tightening, closing off his airways.)



Angry voice: You know what? Fine. Maybe you didn’t just kill it for some selfish reason.



(The man leans down, whispering. Every syllable he utters releases a scalding plume that burns away the hairs on Alex’s neck.)



Angry voice (whispering): I guess that makes you better than a selfish man like me.



(Alex’s vision blurs as the figure’s hand squeezes even tighter. For a moment, all he can taste is smoke and metal. The smell of burning wires fills the corridor, singeing his nose, and forcing tears to pour down his face. He tries uselessly to push against the arms locking around his throat, but they don’t budge.)



(Just when the world starts to go black, a new scent pushes in. Soft, warm. Like old dust, and laundry soap. The heat of rage recedes, the burning hands fall away. And gentle arms wrap around Alex, catching him as he sags to the floor.)



Kind voice: There you go, sweetheart. Just breathe now. I’ve got you.



(Alex lets himself sink into the refreshing embrace of the woman’s arms. Her cardigan is scratchy, but soothing. Her presence slowing his beating heart, even if just by a fraction.)



Alex: Who… who are you?



(The woman’s face is soft, lined with a thousand tiny wrinkles of patience. Her hair is a soft gray, pulled into a loose bun, and her eyes shimmer with tears that never seem to fall.)



Kind voice: I… I wish I knew the answer to that.



(Alex forces himself to push away from her comforting embrace. She looks up at him with a gentle, but sad smile that creases her features. The smell of warm cotton clinging to her like a comforting memory.)



Kind voice: But what I do know is that you’ve been bearing that weight alone for far too long.



(She squeezes his hand gently.)



Kind voice: I wish there was more I could give you than a few comforting words, and a shoulder to rest on.



(Alex shakes his head, refusing to listen to her words.)



Alex: No… that’s not enough. Why do you people just keep following me? Why won’t you… why won’t you do anything besides watch us all suffer?



(He looks up at the kind-faced woman, searching for an answer. But only sees a flicker of regret within her features.)



Kind voice: Because this story… your story… was written beforehand. And we only have the power to flip the pages.



Alex: What the hell does that even mean?



(Alex staggers back, no longer seeing her as a kind woman. But instead, a mask. Barely hiding the edges of the face hiding just beneath the surface of her warm smile.)



Alex: You can’t do anything besides watch. Like you’re some sort of— 



(Alex’s words catch in his throat.)



Alex: You’re… the Spectator… aren’t you?



(The kind woman’s eyes soften, her smile growing mournful as Alex’s realization hangs in the air.)



Kind voice: Some of us go by that name, yes.



(She sits down by Alex, back against the flickering wall, folding her hands in her lap. Alex, caught between exhaustion and a desire for answers, slides down next to her.)



Alex: Those people that worship you… that cult. They said you promised to grant their wishes. Was it all just a lie?



Kind voice: If I could grant any wish, Alex. The first one I would grant is mine.



Alex: And what would your wish be?



(The woman sits quietly for a moment. Her eyes drifting toward the dim light at the end of the corridor.)



Kind voice: The power to take back what this place has stolen from us. Including myself.



(The hallways around them groan softly as they sit in silence once more. But in this still moment, the maze doesn’t press forward. For now. It waits.)



Alex: And why is it that you’re all so different, yet you refer to yourselves as “we”?



(The woman runs her finger along a tear in her cardigan, smoothing the fray with soft trace of her finger.)



Kind voice: Because we are one, yet many. We were born into this world, not knowing why we existed, only that we did. Every one of us with feelings so loud, they couldn’t be ignored. And we carried those feelings until they became who we were.



(Alex stares at her. Her face is calm, but there’s a sadness in her voice that tugs at something deep within him.)



Kind voice: That’s why we seem so different. Because we are. We’re all different threads, pulled from the same fabric.



Alex: What do you mean by the same fabric?



(She hesitates, her eyes dropping to her lap as she tightens her hands over one another.)



Kind voice: I’m not sure…



Alex: Can you at least tell me why you all seem to be following me around? 



Kind voice: Because you were chosen. By her.



(She doesn’t elaborate further. And seems in no rush to do so.)



Alex: How do we leave this place? Is there an exit?



Kind voice: There— 



(A cold, calculating voice rises to the surface.)



Cold voice: That’s enough questions.



(The kind woman blinks slowly, then gently sets her hands on her lap. The warmth bleeds from her face. Her smile doesn’t disappear, but hardens. Then, her eyes grow distant, and her posture straightens.)



Cold voice: You’ve shown nothing to warrant such an answer. If you wish for answers, then prove how granting them would be beneficial to us.



(The figure grows taller, an over-sized lab coat wrapping around its body. Sharp eyes peer over the edge of its glasses as it looks between him and the clipboard in its hand. Alex pushes himself to his feet, backing away from the figure.)



Alex: Then tell me what I’m supposed to do to earn that answer.



(The figure scribbles furiously onto the clipboard, ink dripping down the paper, staining his coat. But the figure doesn’t seem to notice.)



Cold voice: You do not “earn” answers. You either survive long enough to be analyzed. Or you die fast enough to correct an oversight.



Alex: I— 



(A burst of cold air shoves Alex away from the figure. Alex stumbles backwards, his shoulder slamming into the wallpaper, sending flakes of yellow floating in the air. The hallway around him pulses with the coldness emanating from the man’s voice. Even the buzzing of the lights seems to die down.)



Cold voice: The world is built on necessity, not sentiment. Remember that.



(The figure adjusts his glasses, just enough to obscure his eyes completely.)



Cold voice: Observe. Document. Archive. Those are purposes we all serve. Yours however…



(The figure leans forward, lowering his voice.)



Cold voice: Remains to be determined.



(Alex opens his mouth to speak, but the strong smell of burnt coffee and cigarettes stops the words from coming out. He backs away, before a familiar voice picks up from the figure.)



Familiar Woman’s voice: Alex…



(That woman. Just hearing her voice, knowing how much pain she’d caused him for her own selfish desires… if he’d been any braver, he’d have thrown his life away right now in a vain attempt to hurt her. But he wasn’t brave, he was a coward. A coward who wants nothing more than to run away from the woman that took everything from him. His father. His mother. And his laughter.)



Alex: Why… why can’t you just leave me alone, Blanche?



Blanche: It’s because I love you, Alex.



(Alex turns his back to her, starting to run once more.)



Blanche (pleading, shouting): No, Alex! I’ll do anything. Just please…



(The world tilts as Alex begins to take one step after another. If she wanted to, she could catch him at any moment. But Alex knew she wouldn’t. She wanted him to crawl back to her willingly.)



Blanche: Don’t leave me alone again.



(Alex, finding a surge of strength after hearing her disgusting words, begins to lurch forward. He’s not running fast, just as fast as his legs will let him. But he’s not just running to get away from the woman, nor is he afraid of the gelatinous creature whose voice is a mixture of a thousand screams. And he’s not even sure if he even cares about finding John and Nora right now. Because he’s too focused on something else.) 



(He can almost see it now. The edge of a red fabric, slowly descending to the floor in every direction. The curtains are drawing, and he’s not sure how much time he has left.)

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **WNBA Showdown: Los Angeles Sparks vs. Atlanta Dream – A Tale of Desperation vs. Dominance**

The Los Angeles Sparks, currently 1.5 games adrift from the No. 8 playoff seed, are playing basketball’s version of *Clue*: “Who let the defense pack its bags for vacation?” After a recent 11-point home loss to the Atlanta Dream, the Sparks enter this rematch as underdogs, their playoff hopes as fragile as a Jenga tower built by a toddler. Meanwhile, the Dream, fresh off securing a playoff berth, are rolling like a well-oiled circus parade—led by a team that’s 14-6 at home and boasts the WNBA’s second-best offense. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat sheet and the humor of a Twitter thread after a bad coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The betting lines tell a clear story. Atlanta is favored by 5.5-6 points across bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around **1.4** for the Dream (-6 spread) and **3.0** for the Sparks (+6). Converting those to implied probabilities: Atlanta’s 71% chance to win vs. LA’s 33%. The total is set at **169.5 points**, suggesting a high-scoring affair. But here’s the rub: the Sparks’ defense ranks 10th in the league, allowing opponents to shoot like they’re at a free-throw contest. Atlanta’s offense? It’s a well-funded charity event, donating 2nd-best scoring in the WNBA.

Kelsey Plum, LA’s star guard, has averaged **22.5 points** in her two matchups against Atlanta this season, yet her prop is set at 17.5. That’s like betting a fire hydrant will stay dry in a rainstorm. Plum’s scoring prowess against the Dream is so reliable, it’s practically a Netflix series with a guaranteed finale. Conversely, Jordin Canada’s 5.6 assists per game? She’ll need to replicate her 10-assist performance from September 3rd, a feat as likely as me understanding crypto.

1n9i3ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n9i3ik/explore_brita_metro_6cup_water_filter_pitcher/,Explore Brita Metro 6-Cup Water Filter Pitcher Review Is It Worth It?,"Drinking water has always been a focal point in our house; with kids running around all day and two adults working, hydration matters big time. That being said, testing out the Brita 0B11/OB03 Metro Pitcher felt like a project I could genuinely dive into. The *Brita Water Filter Pitcher for Tap and Drinking Water*, as its full title states, boasts some impressive claims about cutting out chlorine taste, reducing impurities, and saving plastic by ditching single-use bottles. After putting it through frequent use over the past few weeks, I’ve got a good sense of how it performs in real-life scenarios—spoiler: it's not too shabby, but there are some quirks to note.

**Sleek and Functional Design**  
This 6-cup Brita Metro Pitcher gets bonus points for its compact footprint. Measuring about 10x10 inches and weighing just over 1.4 pounds, it tucks in snugly on my kitchen counter without hogging precious space. Aesthetically, the bright red color makes it pop, but it’s never overbearing—a surprisingly nice addition to any modern kitchen. The easy-fill locking lid initially caught my attention, since spills are just a reality in my house. True to its design, it does deliver on keeping refills mess-free and efficient, even when my 10-year-old tries to “help.”  

**Cutting Chlorine and Other Impurities**  
The main draw here is, of course, the actual water filtering capability. Copper, cadmium, and mercury, you say? This pitcher is meant to handle those, in addition to totally wiping out that “swimming pool” chlorine taste. I honestly didn't believe how much of a difference it could make until some blind taste-tests with my partner. We both agreed the water tasted significantly cleaner, almost sweet, compared to straight tap water. My coffee game has also stepped up. Using freshly filtered water in the coffee maker? Game-changer.  

[Discover if Brita 0B11/OB03 is on sale at Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b09w4jqq9k/)

**Ease of Use and Added Features**  
If you’ve ever fumbled with annoying filter pitchers, this one feels refreshingly intuitive. The electronic SmartLight filter indicator simplifies things. Green, yellow, or red, it’s a straightforward “change this now or keep going” kind of system. It saves me from guessing when to swap the filter for optimal water quality, and as someone who forgets these little maintenance chores, the reminders are a godsend. The pitcher comes with one standard filter, which lasts roughly two months.  

I haven’t tried upgrading to the Elite filter yet, even though it claims to last six months per use. Standard is holding up fine for now, but I might make the switch later. That being said, keeping the filters on hand is another cost, so it’s worth knowing what you’re signing up for if you drink a crazy amount of water like we do.  

**Highlights**  
- Compact and space-saving; perfect for smaller households.  
- Removes chlorine taste and several metal impurities.  
- SmartLight indicator is a helpful no-brainer for filter replacement.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Only filters 6 cups at a time; may feel small for families.  
- Filters need frequent replacements unless upgrading.  
- Not as durable as some stainless-steel alternatives.  

**Competing Products**  
Given the saturation in the water filtration pitcher market, alternatives abound. One big competitor to this Brita model is ZeroWater, which promises a more thorough filtration, removing “100% of TDS” (total dissolved solids). I’ve used ZeroWater before, and while the taste is ultra-pure, those filters tend to clog up quickly and cost more to replace—so it becomes pricey in the long run.  

On the other hand, PUR pitchers are another solid contender. Their products also reduce contaminants while offering slightly larger models for bigger households. However, their absence of a SmartLight indicator feels like a step backward compared to Brita. If convenience is your priority, the Brita Metro wins over both. Brita’s biggest edge remains the combination of compact size, ease-of-use, and being less finnicky during daily operation.  

**Smart Spending**  
Is this little pitcher worth putting your money into? If you’re an average user looking to cut down plastic waste and save on bottled water costs, the payoff is clear. You can bypass thousands of disposable water bottles every year, which feels like winning both for your wallet and the environment. Considering its modern features and reliable filtration, it skews toward being a budget-friendly option in the long haul. However, if you’re super picky about water purity or need larger capacity, you might want to assess pricier or larger models.

When I first started a few weeks ago I read somewhere that caffeine (coffee) is useful to track as a medication. It comes as a lifestyle factor as well, so not knowing how the app works I decided to double track it until I had time to figure out how to see the impacts and get value out of the app. 

I want to decide on a path forward and cut one method out, but don't understand the tradeoffs here. I can see the effect of the caffeine medication, probably because medications can be correlated with symptoms in subsequent time periods if that's turned on [https://www.reddit.com/r/BearableApp/comments/1imkkfg/comment/mc5mftr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BearableApp/comments/1imkkfg/comment/mc5mftr/)

I imagine it's the same for the lifestyle factor. Except I haven't got enough data for ""no caffeine"" in the caffeine factor apparently. This might be because I drink it every day, **and have only been logging the presence of it every day but not checking ""no"" for the time periods I haven't had it.** If that is required then it seems really cumbersome to do so and I suppose all my existing data will be skewed.

Does anyone know the differences between the two options? in terms of recommended method of entry, and insights you can get out of it? Or do you have another suggestion?

.



1.  Jeff starts to tell Gypsy a little about himself. He grew up in MA, to a good basic middle class family. He was a handful of a child growing up and didn’t like school, he doesn’t like learning in the traditional sense, he still wonders how he graduated high school at all. He’s a baseball fan, although not a skilled player. His family took them on vacations, birthday parties and memorable christmases. He says, “Which brings me to you right now, and part of my draw to you. You never had these opportunities to for these kind of memories. However it's never too late. At first I followed thinking ‘I hope some day | see a story about Gypsy having this wonderful life filled with amazing Christmases with her family, and just a happy ending to all this’. Well now, with all this between you and I. Maybe I'll get to witness all that first hand instead of through a screen.”. He loves making her laugh, when he can tell she’s smiling on the other side of the phone. It’s the impact he’s wanted to have on her since hearing her story. He wanted to email her in hopes to make her smile for 5 seconds. He then goes into about how his life as an adult, working shitty jobs, hanging out with friends and how he had one girl truly break his heart. Then he goes into a story about how him and this ex girlfriend had to date secretly when working at Applebees together, because he was a manager and she was a server/bartender. He got his promotion taken away due to this, he didn’t care tho and even went to Colorado to meet her family. 


2.  Gypsy talks to Jeff about how she has a scruff fetish. Gypsy goes into how she’s nervous about meeting him physically in person and on video. She says the most common reaction people have about her is how short she is. She’s pushing 5ft with shoes, on the petite side, she says video chats will help them ease into meeting one another. (During this timeframe, Gypsy is talking to a woman helping with BACA support letters for early release and Jeff is writing a letter for her). Since Jeff is a supporter of her after watching her documentaries and frequents in her Facebook support group, she tells him, as per his letter, he has an extensive knowledge about her past, but he’s learning about her today. She doesn’t wanna rush into meeting and wants to take things slow. She says that they have been talking for 1.5 months and have gotten to know each other more than the last 6 months of knowing each other (it’s November 2019). Gypsy doesn’t want him to waste his time on her if he feels this isn’t worth it, although she notices he calls her sweetheart and she sent him kissing cards, something she doesn’t do for friends. She tells him she wants things to work out between them, she’s happy to have him in her life, and she’s hoping for an early release from prison, his couch seems perfect. 


3.  Jeff tells Gypsy he just found the videos of her walking in and out of the court room. He says, “Goddamn those curves in all the right places!!! Thinking about you on me with just a tshirt again Now I'm left with a ""problem"" here at work. I'm stuck at my desk again for at least 20 minutes.” 


4.  Gypsy talks to Jeff about the woman who’s helping her with BACA support letter for early release. She tells him that it was all sent to Senator Hawley and she’s waiting on a response. She then describes to Jeff a drawing of all her beauty marks. She then lists them. “one on my inner left upper thigh near bikini line two on my right side boob one on my right rib cage two on my chin one on my forehead more tinnie tiny ones are spread around my body but those aren't note worthy.”. And asks if he has any. 


5.  More facts about Gypsy, she talks about being passive aggressive and stuffing things down deep until she reaches a breaking point and has an attitude. She also says her only sexual experience was with Nick, which left her wondering what the hype was about sex. 


6.  Jeff responds to Gypsy about his support letter to the BACA for Gypsy’s early release. He’s been writing it the last 2 days and says everything it needs to help her get early release from prison. — the BACA did not one particular letter she had sent out, from a friend who knew her, and said that he didn’t talk about Gypsy, he talked about how his life has been better because of Gypsy. We all assumed (me included) it was Ryan. I’m certain this was Jeff. A “fan” of hers, she didn’t even know. 


7.  Gypsy talks about having a NYE party and making her “punch”… juice, coffee, soda combo. 


8.  Gypsy tells Jeff, “I think you grow more charming each day, I do believe you could charm the panties right off me, only one problem,... I'm not wearing any. *wink* “ 
Then goes into detail about how her curls get everywhere including his personal places.


9.  Jeff says to Gypsy that he’s sending her coloring books. Gypsy asked about Kobe Bryant’s rape allegations, this was when he passed away. Jeff then explains the allegations and in a different email Gypsy says it’s sad him and his daughter passed. The rest is Jeff being gross about Gypsy shedding a lot like a kitten and if she decides to wake him up by ticking his ear with her tongue she’s going to be walking funny by the end of the day (🤢)


10.  Gypsy says, “So I woke up to a dick pic from you...(sigh) I gotta say,...a bit of a let down. the shape is all wrong, dont even get me started on the size..:-I LOL nice one. I would have loved for you to tell me I had one coming, me get all ampted up, and when I opened the email saw a guitar pic with the word dick written on it. 


11.  Gypsy says, “Trust me, I'm sure with you, the heater is not necessary for me to ditch the sweater real fast. ok as far as bites go, I like being bitten on my shoulder and forearm, I havent been bit on my neck before so that would be a first. I actually don't mind bite bruises. Next to pet play (taking on the characterists of a cat or dog) the biting is the only other fetish I have. I'm not into masochism, however feeling a hard bite doesn't come across as painful pain to me, it rather is a intense form of pleasure, so even if let out a yip, its not that you would be hurting me its rather the opposite. Hopefully this is not a topic of conversation on the visit, as I WILL have a body blush in front of you... perhaps that pun on your last name (Gagnon) wasn't too far off base, however I'm not into gaging all that much, I would prefer to enjoy slowly tracing little kisses up and down, dancing my tongue around you, then taking all of you while you play with my hair. I'll save the gaging for another time when I'm feeling like a ‘bring your A game, because I'm about to throw you down and....(deleted for content) kinda night""...or day depending when the mood strikes.” Gypsy then says to Jeff that if he would have tried to have a romantic interest in her when she was with Ken, she wouldn’t have been rude but she wouldn’t have pursued further. She brings up a moment that she only called Jeff one time when she was dating Ken, to thank him for sending her birthday money, but it was not to get Ken jealous. 


12.  Jeff is trying to bring Gypsy into reality by telling her realistically her release is 3 years away, and they’ve only been together for 6 months. He does not want to get into details about living situations together because a lot can change in 3 years. If she wants to wait til 1 year or 6 months til release, then fine. For now tho, she needs to be realistic. He feels she’s in a panic because she feels out of control right now. He cares about her and wants to take things slow. Ends it with, “by the way, that drawing on the envelope is REALLY hot. Please don’t do that again. Next time fold it up and send. 


13.  Gypsy wants Jeff to grow his hair out for her release so she can grab his hair that night. She says her will be so long he could wrap it around his hand twice. She then talks about the dimensions of her cubby in prison and how it’s small, but she can fit inside it, “yup, I’m tiny”. Jeff gets sexual about the hair wrapping innuendo. He says, “omg that is tiny!! Yet you have all the amazing curves in all the right places”. Jeff says, “Yes absolutely love guidance in bed! If something isn't working for ya how am I supposed to know!? Lol don't let each other waste time. Hmm thinking about you biting that lucious bottom lip is making me happy I'm at home and don't have to worry about being stuck at my desk for the next 10 minutes trying to cool down.” Gypsy responds, “Just wait til these curves are on your face and your... *wink* My ass is just perfect to hold onto. 3 years, I'm sure you will be more then excited to get me alone. Making out will always be my #1 turn on. Mmmmm Hickies just came to mind. Oh I have a secret, I'm ticklish so when I'm getting a hickie I have to moan loudly so I don't laugh, snort while laughing, and kill the mood. I do enjoy them though. and of course I am aware of your little weak spot. you're gonna wish you hadn't told me where to go to get you all worked up, I'll be taking advantage of that. :-) “. Gypsy then talks about watching tv in a big tshirt and panties and says *coughs* videogram *coughs*

1n9hwjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1n9hwjw/all_the_ways_i_wanted_to_love_you_and_never_can/,All the ways I wanted to love you and never can,"😒We never got to celebrate your birthdays when together. You were in the mental hospital for cutting yourself up when I caught you cheating and then broke up. The second time, same thing. 

The 3rd time you were in a court ordered mental health rehab because you strangled me. I was about to buy lingerie for your bday visit. Instead you were already cheating in rehab with some fugly chick and planning to get intimate with her and leave me if the other one wanted you. Allegedly plans were canceled with her lol. Ok sure.

Had you never cheated or strangled me, there would be no hospitals and court ordered rehabs. 

Therefore, I’d have wanted to bake you or buy you a cake for your birthday shaped like a planet or have some space style decor on it because you love space. 

Or maybe a cake with a little figurine of a man running because you love to run. And around the man would be little trees and a dirt path because you love nature.


I would have gotten stronger and we would go hiking and eventually try to see the Northern Lights. 

We would go camping close by and I’d take extra gabapentin for pain. I’d wake and quietly make us breakfast and coffee, kissing you gently all over your face to wake you. You always loved to be kissed all over. We would take pictures together and see beautiful sights. Then I’d give you a massage after a long day of hiking and cuddle before falling asleep. 

In the summer I would be stronger. And so we would go to Jones Beach and do that obstacle course, and then relax at the beach afterwards, drinking margaritas and cuddling and making out.

We’d also take a road trip to enjoy Schlitterbahn waterpark like we always said we would. It’s the best waterpark ever and you would have loved it

I’d have kept learning to cook just for you.
I wanted to make you lots of Italian food.
I’d have made you romantic candle light dinners in lingerie lol 


I’d  have given birth by now.
We’d have enjoyed shopping for baby items and moving to TX. Free rent for 2 yrs as we saved to go back to NYC. I’d try to work from home or put the baby in daycare. Your mom would somehow not be a mean bully and she’d babysit and let us live with her because you wouldn’t have ruined that.

If you had remained faithful and kind like you tried to be after I first caught you, instead of a cheater and bully, I’d kiss all over you everyday, hug on you like crazy, cuddle, take better care of myself, clean instead of keep bed rotting from being cheated on. You had cured my depression over time and then sent me back into hell

But had everything been different, I’d still be playful and trusting, and nearly worship you. I’d protect you from harm. I’d die if you died. I’d burn down cities to free you from jail instead of helping keep you there. I would have stayed sexually innocent. No breaks ups and then 2 hookups due to you endlessly cheating and making me leave you and seek sexual validation elsewhere. But I did it because you wouldn’t stop being a sex/porn addict cheater, self admitted narcissist, pathological liar, etc. So therefore I’d feel beautiful and never become bitter, more insecure than ever, and hyper focused on worrying if you were cheating.
I’d trust you and look at you with love instead of anxiety and anger

I would make you feel so safe and loved in my arms just like I once did before you made me feel repulsed at times when hugging you be you cheated and let that fugly frog face Olivia hug you. 


Gawd you have no idea how much love I am capable of feeling and giving. I am so passionate and hungry when intimate, playful and fun when on dates, fun, easy to talk to, and always desiring to learn random or new things. 

Over all I was so nurturing, gentle, loving, forgiving, and passionate for you

If only I was enough and if only your brain wasn’t broken.


I love you R.C.R even if you’re no longer capable of seeing me as you used to, and loving me how I deserve. 

I deserved being forgiven for having normal pregnancy hormones. I deserve that after so much abuse and cheating from you when you went to rehab. You demanded I give you a baby and then punished me for being pregnant. Repairing the damage done to me as I deserved to have experienced from you, is what should have happened. You would have experienced healing and love between us if you chose selflessness and empathy. 


I needed to be loved and offered transparency and help with triggers, in order to keep gently loving you. I gave and gave until you took it all. And instead of refilling my cup with love and gratitude, you left me. All for me not having endless ability to magically keep showering  you with love, praise, trust without any work on your end

I’ll never love anyone how I loved you.


Minus the abuse, the good parts of you were my soulmate. It’s unfortunate you were a drug in the end and not a partner. I loved and worshipped u and wanted to get high off loving and being loved by you. I gave my soul and you gladly took it. It was never returned. I am dead inside now. 

You don’t understand how I loved all the little things too. I loved your voice, and how you pronounced certain words. I loved your stringy brown hair and how your scalp smelled. Those crinkly ocean eyes and child like smile was so beautiful. I loved kissing your perfect medium-full lips. We had a nice flow when we kissed. I miss everything about you that didn’t hurt me. How sad that your brain became too broken to recognize my worth any longer all because I understandably reacted to being endlessly betrayed. How dare I feel rage, endlessly ruminate, seek partial revenge, and fall into depression. Like yeah, how dare I not be your perfect robot gf no matter what. 

I’m not how you see me now. 
And you are where you belong for all you did.


And I’m still everything you once loved.
My flaws with self care and cleanliness were resolving because depression had begun to lift. But you fucked it all up and then were annoyed I didn’t keep my apt in good shape.

But you just couldn’t see it. You couldn’t see my worth. You couldn’t see your flaws though.
You saw me as a possession only. I was a product to be used until broken.


I was not a human you truly valued.

How sad to have so much love saved for years, waiting for the right person. And now it’s all gone and I cannot love anyone but you


But now I can’t even love you how I wanted to
Because I now sometimes hate you.
You’re not the mask you pretended was real.

Tasks that should be completed by leadership often get passed down to us half-finished, leaving us to figure out the rest without the credentials or context needed. For example, a recent situation resulted in clients losing access to critical software because the wrong licenses were purchased. When I asked how to respond, I was told simply to “figure it out.”

Yesterday, I finally voiced concerns about being assigned incomplete tasks without the tools to finish them. I sent a professional email explaining that I couldn’t proceed without the correct access and clarification on whether client or internal credentials should be used. This was not intended to be confrontational, just factual.

Instead of addressing those concerns, my boss questioned whether I was “doing any work” and later accused me of “time theft” for clocking in before sitting down at my desk. I explained that when I arrive, I clock in immediately because I am ready to work, even if I briefly grab coffee or use the restroom before settling in. I often eat breakfast at my desk while starting tasks. At no point have I ever intentionally misused time or neglected responsibilities.

What’s most frustrating is that I have never been warned about this supposed issue before, and the accusation was made only after I raised concerns about work being delegated improperly. I take my responsibilities seriously and would never purposefully commit what was described. I’ve simply been doing what I thought was normal, especially since there are no designated times for breaks and were told we can take breaks whenever we want. To say the least my relationship has been permanently affected with this company and I have now started to search somewhere else for a job.

1n9hroc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFBA/comments/1n9hroc/owala_life_brand_is_burning_millions_on_the_wrong/,Owala Life brand is 🔥 burning $Millions on the wrong Amazon ads.,"I ran their bestselling water bottle reviews through BidVentor AI and found 6 profit leaks that would make any CMO cry.

This thread will change how you think about PPC forever.

Buckle up 🧵


LEAK #1: They're attracting customers who want ""indestructible"" bottles

But 11% of reviews say it dents easily when dropped.

Every click from someone searching ""durable water bottle"" = wasted ad spend + 1-star review

Amazon's algorithm HATES this mismatch.


LEAK #2: 22% of customers LOVE the built-in straw

But I bet Owala barely bids on ""water bottle with straw""

This is their #1 differentiator and they're letting competitors steal this traffic.

Criminal negligence in PPC 101.


LEAK #3: 11% rave about how ""easy to clean"" it is

Parents and busy professionals are OBSESSED with this feature.

If you're not bidding heavy on ""easy clean water bottle"" keywords, you're leaving money on the table.

Pure profit sitting there untouched.


LEAK #4: 11% specifically mention ""college students""

This is a $50 billion market that buys in August/September.

Seasonal goldmine with predictable buying patterns.

Yet most brands ignore this demographic completely. Rookie mistake.


LEAK #5: 11% use it for ""hot drinks""

Coffee shop culture is MASSIVE.

LEAK #6: 11% praise the ""leak-proof"" design

Anxiety-driven purchase behavior.

Nobody wants their laptop destroyed by a leaky bottle.

""Leak proof water bottle"" = high-intent, high-converting keywords with premium pricing power.



The pattern every 8-figure seller misses:

Your customers are telling you EXACTLY what to advertise.

I’ve just completed the Rancilio Silvia steam wand installation on my Delonghi Dedica EC685. I followed the tutorial from Tom’s Coffee Corner, and the installation went smoothly.
However, I have an issue: when I press the steam button, it blinks normally while heating, but a bit of steam and water comes out of the group head, which I never noticed before. Once the steam light is solid, I turn the steam lever, and steam comes out for about 5 seconds (if that), then the machine stops abruptly and the buttons blink rapidly three times in a loop.

Hi there! I’m Rick—a friendly, thoughtful guy in my early 50s with a background in theatre and a heart for creating (I work as a roller coaster mechanic and am also passionate about tinkering with 3D printers). I love playing video games and binging true crime documentaries.

I share a cozy 2-bedroom apartment just one mile from the beautiful Huntington Beach shore. You’d be renting a private, unfurnished room (around 10×11 ft) with hardwood floors and a roomy sliding-door closet.

The Living Setup

Shared spaces include the bathroom, enclosed patio right outside the front door, and all apartment common areas.

I live with my cat and bearded dragon, so you should be comfortable with those furry (and scaly!) roommates. If you have ONE cat or a small pet in an enclosure—like a hamster or fish—that’s totally fine, too. Unfortunately, I’m not able to host dogs.

I don’t drink or smoke, but I do occasionally vape 420 indoors—otherwise, feel free to vape inside or outside.

Utilities: We equally split all utilities except electricity, which will be split 60/40, similar to the rent. I'll cover the larger share since I use the garage and other common areas for my 3D printer setup (it's in my room and is whisper-quiet when the door is closed).

Rent: $1,000/mo for your own comfy space. EDIT: For purposes of clarification, my share of the rent will be $500 a month MORE than what I'm charging my roommate. That's an extra 50% on top of the rent they'll be paying, in case anyone wonders why I'm occupying a little bit more than what would otherwise be half of the apartment.

Deposit: $1,000.

About You

I’d love to find someone in a similar stage of life—maybe early 40s to mid-50s. Solo renters only, please (overnight visitors are welcome!). If you’re friendly, respectful, and value a peaceful environment—not to mention proximity to the beach—this could be a great match. In no way am I stating this preference as a requirement.

Want to know more? Let’s connect! We can chat over coffee, or you can simply stop by and see the space. I’m looking forward to meeting you!

Warmly,

I ve been having acid reflux and lactose intolerance since covid and thought it was due to diet , I was drinking coffee all day and night and smoking cigarettes so it seems logical to me. Fast forward , I need to quit smoking because my asthma was getting horrible so I get a pulmonologist and we get on a great asthma regiment but I’m having this continual acid reflux issue and my pulmonologist referred me to a gastro doctor. I never had any indigestion or anything like that that I can remember but constant acid reflux 100% and he gave me omeprazole and scheduled me for an endoscopy and we did that and said I have h pylori and irritation in the stomach, nothing else. Okay fine no problem , he puts me on cefuroxime and I switch over to rabeprazole instead of omeprazole now and my stomach I feel like is getting worse with the PPI because now I’m having bloating , constant gas and irritation when I eat , I never really remember that happening before but I did that for two weeks and he sends me for a CT Scan , says he can see it on there. I get the CT Scan and everything looks great but I’m still having systems. He says let’s wait until October and see what happens. I don’t like that answer because I’m in discomfort now so I got to another gastro with high ratings and he tells me you can’t see h pylori on a CT Scan ( I guess I’m glad it’s done and my organs are fine ) but that I need a breath test. Take that and it’s positive and now he wants to put me on antibiotics. I’m so scared , I’ve been reading stories here and how people feel on them and some people have lingering effects and all this stuff , I’ve also never been this bad before to be honest, constant indigestion- bloating has and even with rabeprazole acid reflux.

1n9hlds,https://i.redd.it/jxrr9oy7zenf1.jpeg,Maintain your own process and rhythm,"Relying on instincts can easily lead to chaos. What truly keeps things steady is process and rhythm.

This is one of the routines I often use for watching the market and preparing before the session. I’m sharing it here so you can use it as a reference to build your own.

Pre-market preparation (8:00–9:30am ET)  
A cup of coffee, then open futures (ES/NQ) to get a read on overall market direction.  
Check treasury yields, the dollar index, and crude oil, as these are sentiment indicators.  
See if TSLA, NVDA, or MSFT have any unexpected moves in pre-market.  
Write down today’s planned trade list and key support/resistance levels.

Tools I often use  
TradingView is a powerful charting tool. I use VWAP, EMA, Fibonacci, etc.  
Finviz gives a clear overview of sector rotation and money flow.  
ZeroHedge and the economic calendar help avoid getting caught off guard by sudden news.  
A small Excel sheet helps me record my entry and exit points every day, and also the opportunities I missed, which is very useful to review later.

During market hours (9:30–4:00pm ET)  
Fifteen minutes before the open, I only observe and don’t trade yet, watching how the market sets up.  
TSLA and NVDA’s VWAP and daily high/low level shifts act as my indicators.  
If a planned signal appears, I execute directly and control position size strictly.  
I cut losses quickly and take profits decisively.  
I take two to three trades per day at most. That’s enough and helps me avoid getting emotional.

Lastly, my reflection: I believe trading is not about inspiration but about repeat, execute, record, and review.  
This is just one of the strategies I use regularly. I’ve followed this particular process for nearly two years. It helped me go from random trading to small but steady profits by removing noise and building structure.",2,1757107683.0,WSBAfterHours,0,1.0,False
1n9hkqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsgambling/comments/1n9hkqe/interac_online_casino_canada_reddit_picks_2025/,Interac Online Casino Canada — Reddit Picks 2025,"Hey everyone. I’ve been gambling online in Canada for around five years now, and since so many folks keep asking about the best Interac online casino sites, I figured I’d share what I’ve learned as of 2025. When I first started, I used credit cards and random e‑wallets, but I soon switched to Interac e‑Transfer because it’s faster, safer, and much more convenient.
Back in the day, playing at land‑based casinos like Fallsview or Casino Montreal meant a long drive and waiting for a table. Over time, I realized that online casino interac platforms offer more convenience, more games, and better control over how I play. This post isn’t about hyping any particular site — just sharing what a Canadian gambler has figured out, especially around Interac deposits and withdrawals.

What Makes the Best Interac Casino Online

After testing dozens of Canadian online casinos that accept Interac e‑Transfer, I’ve noticed a few key things that separate the solid sites from the shady ones:
Fast Interac deposits and withdrawals. Deposits should land instantly (they usually do), and withdrawals shouldn’t take more than a few days. Interac withdrawals typically reach your bank in 1–3 business days after the casino’s internal review.

1) Trusted software providers. Look for games from Pragmatic Play, NetEnt, Microgaming, Play’n GO, etc.

2) Support that understands Canadian banking. Staff should be familiar with Interac e‑Transfer, not just generic payment methods.

3) Smooth mobile play. Slots and table games should work flawlessly on your phone.

4) Reasonable bonuses. Watch for wagering requirements that aren’t ridiculous.

The Reality of Online Gambling in Canada

Online gambling in Canada exists in a grey area. Most casino interac online platforms are licensed offshore (Malta, Curaçao, Kahnawake) but still accept Canadian players. The industry has matured in the last few years, and online casinos for real money have become more sophisticated. Many Canadians use Interac daily: it’s a domestic network established in 1984, and in 2022 Interac processed over a billion transactions in a single year, which speaks to how trusted it is.

However, major banks like RBC and TD sometimes block or reverse gambling-related transfers. In my experience, sticking to Interac e‑Transfer (rather than Interac Online) and using well‑known licensed casinos avoids most of the issues. You may encounter daily withdrawal limits around C$2,000 - C$3,000, so plan accordingly.

What Interac Online Casino Sites Actually Offer

The top Interac online casinos in 2025 typically provide:

1) Thousands of slot titles and casino games. Top sites offer 1,000–3,000 slots, with new releases weekly.

2) Real-money blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. Live dealers stream from studios, making the online experience feel like a brick‑and‑mortar venue.

3) Banking in Canadian dollars with Interac e‑Transfer. Deposits are often instant, and withdrawals can be processed via Interac e‑Transfer or other e‑wallets.

4) Mobile apps or responsive websites. You can play anywhere, whether you’re at home or on a coffee break.

How I Find a Reputable Online Casino in Canada

When I’m looking at new online casino interac e transfer sites, here’s my checklist:

1) Licensing. Curacao and Malta are common, but some players prefer Kahnawake or Ontario‑licensed sites.

2) Real player reviews. Reddit threads and forums give honest feedback on payout reliability and support.

3) CAD banking options. If the site doesn’t offer Interac or other CAD-friendly methods, it’s not worth my time.

4) Track record. How long has the casino served Canadian players? A new site might offer huge bonuses but could disappear overnight.

5) Responsible gambling tools. Self-exclusion and deposit limits are must-haves for safe play.

Real Money Games Like Canadians Actually Play

The best Interac casinos aren’t just about flashy slots (though those are fun). Here’s what’s popular right now:

1) Online Slots. Most Interac casinos focus heavily on slots. Titles from Play’n GO (fun features, solid RTP), Pragmatic Play (big jackpots, loads of choices), Microgaming (classics), and NetEnt (polished graphics) dominate the lobbies. Top sites often have 2,000+ slot titles.

2) Table & Live Dealer Games. You’ll find live blackjack with Canadian-friendly dealers, multiple roulette variants (European, American, Lightning), baccarat for all bankrolls, and often poker or video poker rooms.

3) Specialty & Crash Games. Some sites feature crash or instant-win games for quick adrenaline hits.

Money Management at Interac Online Casinos

This part matters more than the games themselves:

1) Set deposit limits before you start. Interac makes it easy to send money, so set a budget and stick to it.

2) Stick to your bankroll. Don’t chase losses — it never ends well.

3) Use bonuses wisely. Some sites have reasonable wagering, while others trap you. Read the terms before claiming.

4) Think of it as entertainment. Online gambling should be fun; treat any win as a bonus, not a paycheck.

What Good Interac Casinos Do Right

The best online casino canada interac platforms stand out because they:

1) Offer support during Canadian hours. Getting help at 3 a.m. matters.

2) Are optimized for Canadian internet speeds. Smooth play even in rural areas is a plus.

3) Have CAD banking without hidden fees. No conversion to USD or EUR.

4) Provide mobile gameplay that doesn’t crash on Telus, Rogers, or Shaw networks.

Current State of Online Gambling in Canada

Canada’s gambling market is shifting. Physical casinos are still busy, but more people are going online. Offshore casinos remain accessible, and the best real‑money sites are adapting to Canadian players’ needs. As long as you stick with licensed platforms and use trusted payment methods like Interac, you’re in decent shape.

What Safe Interac Online Casinos Provide

The most reputable Interac casinos in 2025 always include:

1) Secure deposits and withdrawals in CAD. Transactions are encrypted and backed by bank-level security.

2) Transparent return-to-player (RTP) percentages. Many providers publish RTPs, so you know game fairness.

3) Responsible gambling tools. Self-exclusion, deposit limits, and reality checks help keep things under control.

4) Reasonable withdrawal times. Interac e‑Transfer withdrawals usually take 1–3 business days after approval, sometimes faster if auto-deposit is enabled.

Online Casino Experience vs Land-Based in Canada

These days, the online experience often matches or surpasses physical venues:

1) Better payout rates (RTPs). Online slots can offer higher RTPs than land-based machines.

2) No travel or parking costs. Play in your pajamas if you want.

3) 24/7 access. No need to wait for a seat at your favorite table.

4) Comfort and privacy. You control your environment and pace.

Finding Your Match

Not every online casino interac payment site is the same. Some excel at slots, others at live dealers or specialty games. Picking your best fit depends on:

1) Game preferences. Slots vs table games vs live dealers.

2) Bonus style. Some offer huge welcome bonuses; others reward loyalty.

3) Banking needs. Interac, credit card, crypto — choose what suits you.

4) Preferred device. Playing mainly on mobile? Make sure the interface works smoothly.

Final Thoughts on Real Money Interac Casinos

After years of playing, I’ve learned that the best Interac online casino isn’t always the flashiest. The platforms that stand out pay quickly, offer fair terms, and don’t mess players around.

Online casinos beat land-based options for convenience and variety. Start small, test withdrawals early, and see what fits your style. At the end of the day, gambling online in Canada should be fun. Set your limits, gamble responsibly, and enjoy yourself.

What about you? Have you found an Interac online casino that actually delivers? I’d love to hear how other Canadians are navigating the 2025 Interac casino landscape.

Hey there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan looking to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or by the water. Once winter comes around, I enjoy quiet nights in with coffee, a good book, or a series to binge.

A little about me. I am 5’10, athletic build, with green eyes and brown hair. I do not smoke, I drink socially, and I like staying active but also appreciate slowing down and enjoying life’s simple moments.

What I am looking for is someone down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am not focused on age or body type because what matters most to me is trust, good communication, and a strong mental connection.

Life is better when you have someone to share it with. Whether that is grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or seeing if it turns into something more, I am open to it. If you value laughter, honesty, and enjoying the simple things, I would love to hear from you.",0,1757107295.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False
1n9hfek,https://i.redd.it/dz1rjnr2yenf1.png,$12 for free coffee for life: Why my Petro Serve mug is one of the best deals I’ve ever found,"

I just bought a 52oz refill mug from Petro Serve for \$11.99. The deal? Free refills for life at any Petro Serve location.

Yeah, they have smaller mugs for cheaper, but I drink about a pot of coffee a day, so the 52oz size is basically perfect one fill = my daily intake.


My old at-home coffee math

For a 64oz pot:

Grounds: \$1.59
Filter: \$0.05
Sugar: \$0.07
Creamer: \$0.49

Total = \$2.20/day → \$803/year.


Mug math

Mug: \$11.99 (one-time).
Refills: \$0. Forever.
Works at **any Petro Serve**.

Savings

Year one: \$803 – \$11.99 ≈ \$791 saved.
Every year after that: ≈ \$803 saved.

That means the mug pays for itself in less than a week.


Bottom line:
The coffee from Petro Serve is decent for sure, so I’ll never buy grounds, filters, sugar, or creamer again as long as I live in this town. A one-time \$12 mug killed an \$800/year expense.

He's more reclusive but can socialize if he needs to, and is more drawn to other reclusive or quiet people (extroverts if they are respectful and not pushy, he likes them). He's not shy. His love life has been up and down, it's unintentionally been more quantity than quality. 

River is straight, mtf, and 5'8', she's a comic nerd too but her favorites are the dc speedsters & green lanterns (and superman). Her early childhood was spent in Ukraine with her dad until they moved to the us, he passed from illness in her early teenage years but was very supportive. Her middle and late teen years were mostly risk taking and unhealthy lifestyle choices. She's about 20 now and clean. She works jobs on and off (food service, retail, coffee shops etc) she hates working (she usually quits but occasionally gets fired for being late too often) and loves to be in bed when she can be. Her love life is also a huge mess. She's a foodie and loves snacks, ice cream, and pancakes. The only reason why she works is to afford her rent and to save up to go to an art school/college. She likes drawing, she just procrastinates it more than Malcom does, and her style is more traditional sketching / semi-realism compared to Malcom who likes doing comic art and in color. Malcom makes ocs, she doesn't

When I was 17 I started going out with his mother who was then 15. In my country the age of consent is 16 and there are no Romeo and Juliet laws. When she got pregnant her mother reported me to the police and my name was plastered all over the media as a paedophile. I'm making this short and not going into details but the whole thing, involving being arrested, my computer being confiscated and every little thing used against me by a female police inspector with me ending up in prison when I was 20 ruined my life. I have a criminal record and I am on the sex offender's register. I have not gone out with a woman since I got out of prison. I just don't trust them anymore.

I get to see my son in the weekends and I have a lot of time on my hands because employers here ask for your criminal record and even though I have a hard science degree I get excuses. So money is really tight.

I'm ashamed to say that I have occasionally made some money by letting gay guys blow me. They do not seem to care that I was in prison.

I feel alone. I have an instagram account where all I do is post photos of sunsets etc. I have never posted a photo of myself or of my son.

Recently a woman slightly younger than myself started messaging me. She started by saying what a good photographer I was and we chat everyday. I checked and she is real. She works with someone I know. She keeps asking for my photo and I refuse but still she continues to agree with whatever I say. Today we got talking about sex. It started because I said something about weird fetishes and she replied that for her sex is a very intimate and loving thing. I told her that I agree but that sex can be had for fun too. She agreed with me too. So basically, anything I say, she agrees with. She has asked me to meet with her for coffee at least 3 times. 

I know for a fact that I am talking to a real person because we also send voice messages to each other and I checked with people who know her. But why would a 23 year old woman with beautiful blue eyes want to settle with a guy like me?",30,1757107080.0,MensRights,7,0.95,False
1n9hcaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1n9hcaq/movies_like_soft_quiet/,Movies like Soft & Quiet?,"Hello!! So after watching Soft & Quiet, The Coffee Table, Clovehitch Killer, and so on (not necessarily grouping them together. More so driving the point of style(?)), I think I have come to realize these are the types of “horror” movies I love. Framed as real life with insane moral dilemmas. There are some common grounds they are propped up on, perhaps slow burn type, perplexing situations, no actual jump scares, an eerie feeling to them. 

Not sure if any of what I said above makes sense. However, if someone reading this has some sort of recommendation based on what I described/listed in terms of examples, I would be so grateful!

No spoiler below but just generally on the movie Soft & Quiet. I think this movie did a fabulous job of conveying the human aspect of hopelessness and vulnerability. I went into sort of blind. Obviously, like when laws are made and passed, I think movies should be critiqued and taken into consideration with the cultural commentary they were made in. Soft & Quiet I think did an excellent job of balancing this. Without making it too political, it exhibited a very raw side of how imagine a group of people feel in the wake of social change. The conflicting right and wrong scenarios are grim. It really strikes at that by stander effect in all of us.

The job is part of a chain in my county

I'm planning on moving to student accomodation near the uni, but that would mean I can't work this job in this location anymore, even if I had a car, it would still be a 25-30 minute commute from the uni to the town.

The original thought was to quit the job, go through the academic year, and then work the job again during the summer to save up.

But I don't know what my maintenance loan will look like so I don't know if I'll need a job during term time.

There's another store of the same coffee chain I could get a job at but that would mean I would only work there during term time since I'd very likely be going back home during the summer holiday.

I could maybe sort out something where I work at the Uni near store during term time and the home near store during summer holiday but I'm not sure how realistic that option is.

I find it funny when people ask me how come I have a 9 year goal.

It's an easy answer.
It's not because I'm ambitious.

It's just a mere distraction.... A mirage.
A distraction to keep me here.. alive.

I envy the Swiss for that law where assisted suicide is allowed. They are always ahead of everyone. Fuck you guys.

How dreamy...
To be honest with you, I really don't see anything to keep me here.

I am beyond tired of the traumas and the unnecessary sufferings.

I no longer see beauty in this world.
I only see things with cynicism and nihilism. 

I am not trying to play the victim here. I do not need your sympathy. I am way stronger than most people. My past, trauma, sexual assaults, scars and wounds are a testament to that. 

But there's still a part of me that wants to fell in love with the world...

Maybe I'm just blinded by the blood ozzing from my wounds.

Sometimes, I do not even know what I'm really looking for... or what I am hoping for.


I try to convince myself to go forward for the sake of knowledge or wisdom.

Or for my beloved husband.

Or for my 9 year plan.

But I'm just a human. My energy and strength diminishes at some point.

I'm at the edge of everything.


I want to jump on a running train while medicated with benzodiazepines and morphines. Those meds might probably ease the pain. Or probably add some damn mushrooms on it. Probably I'll find my nirvana and only to be killed by a train. Jokes on me. Lol


I really don't see the point of all of these. At some point I just laugh at the absurdities. Who am I but sisyphus the female version. Rolling a damn fucking boulder back and forth pretending that I am still enjoying this agony.

Just an advice to pedophiles: just kill yourselves, it will do the humanity good. Instead of making broken men and women. I hope you all get fucked by a donkey. I wish your head will be chopped by a spoon repeatitively. Your existence results in people like me broken beyond repair.

Just an advice to abusive Narcissists: Don't have kids. Please. For the love of god. Castrate yourself. Torch your dicks/pussies from fucking vulcanos. Or let the elephant's nose break your dick. Just please. Don't have fucking kids. No existence is preferrable than being in this pain.

Friendships are really important in both good times and bad times, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to be able to support one another. Truth be told that this year has been quite difficult for me, but I think that is all the more reason to pursue more meaningful friendships.

Arriving early- You absolutely want to take a day before the cruise. Seattle airport is a nightmare to navigate, and I definitely am glad we weren't under any time constraints.  


Onboarding Seattle- Easiest onboarding process ever. We arrived at about 11 AM for our time slot. Despite the volume of people arriving with us, we encountered almost no line. We dropped our bags with the porter, entered the building, showed our passports, got our cards, and were on the ship in a grand total of about fifteen minutes. The only delay was that I'm nonbinary, so the computer system didn't really know what to do with my gender being marked as X on my passport. It was easily resolved, and on we went. I do recommend taking an uber or shuttle to the pier, since I don't know how far the parking garage is or how easy it would be to access.

  
Stateroom- We stayed in a family suite, room 10353. The cabin easily sleeps six, so it was very roomy for the four of us. We had two full bathrooms (one with a bathtub), two bedrooms, another convertible bed in the living room, stocked in-room coffee bar. Well more than enough storage space for everyone and no fighting over the bathroom! We were definitely glad of the extra space to spread out since we unfortunately got sick. The extra bedroom meant we could isolate and minimize the spread between us. If a balcony is a must-have for you, the digital screen just won't do, but I tend to prefer oceanview rooms or insides, so it worked out fine for me.  
  
Our cabin steward was fantastic. Anything we needed, he brought quickly. We had a small issue on the way back from the hot tub one night when our card reader battery died, and he called security for us right away to get the door open and battery replaced. We didn't make use of the concierge service at all--I work for NCL and have cruised several times, so I prefer to just handle reservations on my own.

  
Signature Dining- We went to four signature dining restaurants (Le Bistro, Ocean Blue, Teppanyaki, and Q). LOVED the food, and the service was fantastic. I don't know if I'd do Teppanyaki or Q again just because I'm very sensitive to loud, boisterous environments, but they were definitely worth having once. Le Bistro is a standby favorite of ours, we've had it on every sailing we've ever done and probably will do. Ocean Blue was also worth the visit. My wife historically hates seafood, but if you're going to try salmon, the Pacific northwest is probably the place to do it. She actually enjoyed it quite a bit! 

  
Included dining- The Garden Cafe buffet was, well. A buffet. No complaints, but no standouts either. There was always plenty to choose from, classic burgers and pizza to Indian food to a carving station and cold cuts. The Local was also great for a quick bite at weird times, if you woke up too late for breakfast for example. The main dining rooms (Taste, Savor, and Manhattan) always had something tasty to offer, and we were always seated quickly. Food came out hot, and the waitstaff was attentive. Really, the only miss was the American Diner. I can definitely understand why it's no longer a paid venue. I would have been really disappointed if I'd used a dining credit for food I could have gotten at the Local.

  
Pools and hottubs- There's a splash area for kids, but the main pools are both over five and half feet deep with no shallow end or incline. I would have loved a place to just \*be\* in the cooler water without having to deal with running kids or having to tread deep water (I'm SHORT), but there really wasn't anywhere. The hot tub at Spice H2O was great, but it was closed for rough seas the one time I really wanted to use it. That left just the main hot tubs on the pool deck, which were packed to the gills and also full of kids.   
  
\*\*PSA: Parents, if you know your child has friggin ATHLETE'S FOOT, don't let them in the hot tub! Or at least make them wear water shoes to keep that covered. It's gross. We went immediately back to the room to scrub every inch of ourselves pink after one kid all but shoved her nasty foot in our faces.\*\*

  
Entertainment- I can't really speak to the onboard entertainment since we didn't go to any of it. The snatches of music we heard were always good, and it was fun to try to guess the trivia in the Atrium as we walked by, but we were on the whole more likely to be relaxing in our room or standing out on the Waterfront to soak in the view.   


Weather- Early to mid August was fantastic weather for us. We're all from the upper midwest, so summer temperatures in the 50s to low 70s were perfect. I'd recommend bringing one sweater, a hoodie, poncho/umbrella and a ballcap. I wore khakis or jeans and a tee shirt the whole time and then adjusted my outerwear if it got chilly or rainy. The only really RAINY days were Juneau at the glacier and Icy Strait Point. The rest of the time it was partly cloudy or overcast, which suited us just fine.   


Ports- Are really what you make of them. I did excursions through NCL everywhere except Victoria, and I feel like I got what I paid for. We did a mix of history, art, and nature excursions. Definitely bring comfortable walking shoes! We were TOAST by the end of the cruise. No matter what you choose, you cannot beat the views. Coming from Nowheresville, Michigan, they were absolutely unreal!

  
Debarking- If I do have one complaint about the cruise, it was getting off the ship at the end. We relaxed for hours after we had to be out of our stateroom, ate a leisurely breakfast, and walked off the ship with no problems. But clearing security was an absolute travesty. I don't know if Seattle is always this unorganized or if it's just the current administration, but I know I've never once had this long of a wait just to go through CBP. I swear, it felt like we only took two or three steps forward every ten minutes. Fortunately, three of us were staying in the city after the cruise and the remaining one had a late flight, or we never would have made it. ",2,1757105732.0,NCL,3,0.75,False

1n9gpme,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9gpme,Jourdan Rombough AI Images,"**I Uploaded 5 Photos of My Face Into GPT-5. These Were the Results.**

I’ve been experimenting with GPT-5’s text-to-image, and I wanted to see how far it could push identity consistency if I gave it some reference material. So I uploaded five normal shots of my face — different angles, nothing fancy — and then fed it prompts ranging from professional portraits to cinematic scenes.

The results surprised me. They weren’t just generic outputs with my face pasted in. Each image had its own atmosphere, lighting, and design language, almost like GPT-5 was reconstructing entire worlds around me. Some were spot-on, others had flaws that gave away the AI’s hand, but overall the range was pretty wild.

The first image I tried was a **logo of my initials, JGR**. I asked GPT-5 for a glossy, colorful, 3D-style logo, and what came back looked like something you’d see in a corporate rebrand deck. Bright neon gradients, overlapping forms, and a glassy texture that popped off the screen. It definitely nailed the polish and depth, although the readability was a little messy if you shrink it down. The kind of thing that looks fantastic at poster size but maybe not as a favicon.

Next up I wanted something more atmospheric, so I went with a **street magician vibe**. The prompt was: “photorealistic gritty street scene, golden hour, playing cards scattered on the ground, graffiti with my name in the background.” And it delivered. The pavement glowed with warm light, the graffiti blended naturally with the wall texture, and the cards looked like they were really part of the scene. The only thing that stood out was the floating card in the middle — it looked a little rigid, almost like it was propped up, which broke the illusion slightly. But overall it had a cinematic realism I didn’t expect.

I then shifted to something closer to my professional world: **SEO and digital marketing portraits**. One version had me standing in front of glowing analytics dashboards in a dark red shirt, arms folded, giving off that “data strategist” look. The likeness was strong, the lighting was solid, and the dashboards looked real at first glance — until you zoomed in. Then you realize the numbers and text dissolve into AI gibberish. It’s funny because it gets the *feel* of a dashboard perfectly, but not the actual content.

Another take on the same theme was a **cartoon illustration** of me as an “SEO tactician.” Flat, SaaS-style vector art with dashboards floating around me. And honestly, it looked like it could be pulled straight from a startup’s landing page. Very clean, consistent, on-brand. The weakness here is the opposite problem: it looked a bit too generic. Like stock art with my face mapped in. Still, the fact that GPT-5 can switch gears so easily from realism to flat illustration is impressive.

Then came my favorite: the **airport noir scene**. I asked for a moody, cinematic shot of me in a trench coat with gloves, walking across a runway at night with fog and blurred lights in the background. This could have been a still from a spy thriller. The bokeh and lighting were on point, the atmosphere felt heavy, and the expression it generated fit the scene perfectly. The only flaw was that the gloves blended into the coat a little too much, so they lost some definition. But as a piece of “synthetic photography,” this one really stood out.

I also wanted to see how it handled **cyber aesthetics**, so I tried a hacker-style scene. The output was a split-panel composition: in the top, I’m in a suit and sunglasses checking my phone; in the bottom, I’m typing on a laptop with glowing dashboards on the screen. It had a gritty spy-movie quality, though some of the text on the phone and laptop was, again, nonsense. There was also a faint horizontal glitch line running across the image, which gave away that this wasn’t perfect rendering. But stylistically? Very cool.

For a lighter mood, I tested a **morning coffee scene**: me standing on brownstone steps in NYC, golden sunlight, suit jacket open, sunglasses on, coffee cup in hand. The lighting was gorgeous. The warm glow across the steps and jacket looked like it came from a real lens at sunrise. The only thing that threw me was the coffee cup itself — the proportions looked off, almost toy-like. But the vibe? Nailed.

And finally, I asked it to generate a **four-panel NYC lifestyle collage**: me walking across a street, sipping coffee, checking my phone, entering the subway. This one impressed me for a different reason: continuity. Across all four frames, it kept the character consistent. Same outfit, same lighting, same facial structure. Earlier AI models often messed this up, making the “same person” look like four different people. GPT-5 held it together, and the result looked like a legit marketing storyboard. The only noticeable flaw was with the phones — they always melt into vague glowing rectangles when you look closely.

Overall, this test left me convinced that GPT-5 isn’t just “generating pictures.” It’s simulating optics, design rules, and narrative structure. From glossy 3D logos to spy-movie stills to SaaS illustrations, it shifted styles with ease.

The weaknesses were consistent: text is gibberish, small props like hands and cups sometimes get uncanny, and there are occasional artifacts or over-smoothing. But the strengths outweigh them: identity continuity, atmosphere, and an ability to construct scenes that feel like they were shot through real cameras.

To me, this doesn’t feel like collage anymore. It feels like synthetic photography. And I can’t help but wonder: if it already simulates our visual rules this well, what happens when it starts inventing *new* ones?",1,1757105564.0,u_Firm_Restaurant5599,0,1.0,False

1n9gmc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowthIntel/comments/1n9gmc1/ad_copy_that_converts_three_lessons_from_spending/,Ad Copy That Converts: Three Lessons from Spending Six Figures Of My Own Money On Google Ads,"Howdy All

Lock in again ahead of the weekend for some more google ads sauce. In my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1hyp28j/5_things_i_wish_i_knew_about_google_ads_before_i/), I touched on the importance of good ad copy which prompted a lot of DM's asking me what exactly that meant. For those that are more advanced, this will be cakewalk, but I do hope this can serve as a useful guide to those that are new or are considering using google ads for their business. So without further ado, here goes:

**Lesson 1: Emotion + Facts: The Winning Combo**

* To create ad copy that truly converts, you need to speak to both the heart and the mind. All decisions, whether we like it or not, are largely emotional, with logic serving as post-action justification. The best-performing ads tap into this, combining emotional appeal with factual proof to compel action - emotions drive clicks and facts build trust (and in turn conversions). Great ad copy blends both of them together seamlessly.
* **Example:**
   * Emotional Hook: *“Tired Of Feeling Stuck In Your Career?”*
   * Factual Proof: *“95% Of Our 20,000 Graduates Landed A High-Paying Job In Tech Within 6 Months.”*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * Adjust the emotional & factual balance by your product / service niche and audience type. Low cost commodity physical products will require different language & tonality to say an enterprise software company for example. Find the emotional and factual balance that converts best for your audience, and scale those campaigns accordingly.

**Lesson 2: Specificity Will Always Beat Generalization**

* Now that we’ve covered the importance of emotion and facts, let’s talk about another crucial element - specificity. Generic half-hearted ad copy doesn’t just not stand out, it actively reduces trust. People respond to offers that make them feel heard. Being specific helps your ad answer the user’s subconscious question: *“Why does this ad deserve a click?”.* After all, you're also competing against a sea of often higher ranked organic results.
* **Example**
   * Generic: *“Reduce Joint Pain Using Our Proprietary Formula”*
   * Specific: *“Relieve Joint Pain By More Than 50% In Just 14 days - Clinically Proven And Trusted By 25,000+ Arthritis Sufferers Worldwide.""*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * Always include numbers to describe time saved, results achieved, or improvements made. Use data from real customer results and case studies to provide this type of specificity. Test out anchoring your offer to industry comparisons. By positioning your product against competitors you addresses the user’s implicit question: *“Why should I choose you over others?”*

**Lesson 3: The Importance of Contextual Relevance**

* Great ad copy isn’t just about what you say, it’s about saying it at the right place & time. Contextual relevance ensures your message resonates with the user’s immediate situation, such as their location, device or even time of day. When ads feel personalized to the moment, they drive higher engagement and conversions.
* **Example**
   * Not Contextually Relevant: *“Fast Online Coffee Order”*
   * Contextually Relevant: *“Hot Coffee Delivered To Your Office In Under 20 Minutes - Perfect For Your Afternoon Break.”*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * This is quite offer dependant but using geo-targeting and separating out your campaigns to make your ad feel local will always provide better results than not doing so. Tailor your messaging to align with user behaviour throughout the day and thoughtfully account for how mobile users interact with your ads differently than desktop users.

Now, all of this is well and good but it can only take you so far without a proper landing page that knows how to convert users. But I'll leave out that rabbit hole for another time... As always, if you have a question that you don't want to share publicly, DM's are open.

Sending positive vibes and I hope you all have a restful weekend ahead.

Picking up my husband from the airport after his business trip, I saw him kissing a girl passionately.

She had just turned nineteen—the niece I had raised with my own hands.

She nestled shyly in his arms while he gently smoothed the wind-tousled strands of her hair.

That kind of effortless intimacy was a tenderness he hadn’t shown me in years.

I never imagined that in ten years, that little girl would grow into such a beauty.

Or that a man’s affection could drift away so quietly, without a sound.

I watched the scene calmly, without stepping forward.

I simply turned around and walked away.

From that moment on, I decided to let them be.

What Layton didn’t know was that letting go would cost him me—forever.

---------

By the time Layton called out from behind me, I had already reached the parking lot.

The October wind was sharp, cutting across my face like a blade.

My hand trembled slightly as I gripped the car keys—I wasn’t sure if it was from the cold or from the shock.

“Meredith, wait up.”

He caught up and reached casually for the coffee in my hand.

I turned away, avoiding his touch.

Layton paused, then smiled. “What’s wrong? Who upset our Meredith?”

Our Meredith.

He hadn’t called me that in years.

The last time was probably three years ago.

“I’m tired. I want to go home,” I said, sliding into the driver’s seat.

Layton got in on the passenger side and buckled his seatbelt. “This trip was exhausting—endless schmoozing every night. Oh, by the way, Mom’s coming over for dinner. Don’t forget to pick up some extra groceries.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my eyes on the road.

In the rearview mirror, I could see the airport exit.

Hana was walking out, pulling a pink suitcase, smiling at her phone.

I’d gone with her to buy that suitcase last month. She said pink made her look younger.

“By the way, is Hana back too?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

Layton’s phone buzzed just then. He glanced down. “Probably. Didn’t she say she was starting an internship? Oh—she just texted. Says she’s already home.”

Already home.

But I had just seen her walking out of the airport.

My chest tightened.

So they had already gotten this good at lying to me.",2,1757105077.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1n9gg8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SamsungFrameTV/comments/1n9gg8l/mitolyn_reviews_and_complaints_an_honest_customer/,Mitolyn Reviews and ComplaintS:~ An Honest Customer 2025 Review!,"**Mitolyn** is a cutting-edge dietary supplement designed to support healthy mitochondrial function, energy production, and overall vitality. Mitochondria, often referred to as the “powerhouse” of cells, play a critical role in converting nutrients into usable energy. As we age, mitochondrial efficiency declines, leading to fatigue, slower metabolism, and reduced cellular health. Mitolyn aims to combat this decline by providing science-backed ingredients that promote optimal mitochondrial activity.

This supplement has gained popularity among individuals looking for improved energy levels, better metabolic health, and enhanced overall well-being. It combines natural extracts, vitamins, minerals, and powerful antioxidants to target cellular energy pathways. Unlike typical energy boosters that rely on caffeine or stimulants, Mitolyn works at the cellular level to support long-term energy production and cellular repair.

Many users consider Mitolyn a holistic approach to health, addressing not just fatigue but also supporting brain function, cardiovascular health, and metabolic balance. With its carefully selected ingredients and a formulation backed by research, Mitolyn has positioned itself as a leading mitochondrial support supplement in 2025.

# How Does Mitolyn Work?

Mitolyn’s effectiveness lies in its ability to enhance cellular energy production by targeting the mitochondria. The mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that fuels most cellular functions. Over time, stress, poor diet, toxins, and aging can impair ATP production, causing sluggishness and health concerns. Mitolyn supports ATP synthesis by supplying essential nutrients that optimize mitochondrial activity.

The formula combines antioxidants that fight free radicals, reducing oxidative stress that can damage mitochondria. It also includes co-factors and amino acids that help in the creation and recycling of ATP. Key compounds in Mitolyn are known to improve mitochondrial biogenesis, meaning they help create new mitochondria and improve the efficiency of existing ones.

Another way Mitolyn works is by improving metabolic flexibility. This means your body can efficiently switch between burning carbohydrates and fats for energy. Users often report more stable energy levels, less midday fatigue, and improved focus. The supplement is non-stimulant, so it avoids the crash associated with caffeine-heavy products.

# Why Choose Mitolyn?

The supplement industry is crowded with energy boosters and health enhancers, but Mitolyn stands out for several reasons. First, it’s formulated with transparency and scientific backing. Each ingredient has been chosen based on research showing its impact on mitochondrial health. Second, Mitolyn is free from harmful additives, fillers, and artificial stimulants.

Choosing Mitolyn means investing in long-term cellular health rather than temporary energy spikes. It appeals to individuals struggling with chronic fatigue, slow metabolism, weight concerns, or cognitive slowdown. Many health enthusiasts and professionals emphasize that improving mitochondrial function can positively influence nearly every aspect of health, including aging, immune response, and endurance.

Lastly, Mitolyn is manufactured in a facility that adheres to strict quality standards, ensuring safety and potency. With many positive testimonials and a strong money-back guarantee, it has become a trusted name in mitochondrial supplements.

# Mitolyn Customer Reviews

Thousands of customers have shared their experiences with Mitolyn, and the majority highlight increased energy, mental clarity, and improved overall health. Users report feeling more productive throughout the day, better exercise performance, and reduced feelings of burnout.

One reviewer noted, “I was constantly tired despite a healthy diet. After taking Mitolyn for six weeks, I noticed a significant boost in energy and focus. It’s a game-changer for my daily routine.”

Another user mentioned, “Mitolyn has helped me manage my weight better by improving my metabolism. I feel more active and no longer rely on multiple cups of coffee to get through the day.”

# Mitolyn Bonuses

When purchasing Mitolyn through its official website, customers often receive additional bonuses, such as free e-books on nutrition and energy optimization, special discount bundles, and limited-time offers for free shipping. These bonuses add value to the purchase and help users maximize results.

# Mitolyn Ingredients

Mitolyn’s formulation includes scientifically validated ingredients for energy production and antioxidant defense. Some key components include:

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)** – Supports ATP production and protects mitochondria from oxidative damage.  
* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)** – Encourages the growth of new mitochondria and enhances brain health.  
* **L-Carnitine** – Assists in transporting fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production.  
* **Alpha-Lipoic Acid** – A powerful antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress and supports glucose metabolism.  
* **Magnesium and B-Vitamins** – Essential for enzyme function and energy metabolism.  
* **Adaptogenic Herbs** – May help the body adapt to stress and maintain optimal energy balance.  

Each ingredient is included in clinically relevant amounts to ensure efficacy and safety.

Which means if you lose them, or need them, you’re kind of stuck in the water. 

I ended up reverse-engineering them in Fusion 360 and 3D printed the replacements. It was a fun learning project and they turned out great, so I thought I’d share the file with the community in case someone else has the same headache and trouble looking for these rare and hard to find parts. And I would love some feedback and recommendations and honest reviews.

I’m making the 3D print STL file available free through September — grab it, print as many as you like, and hopefully it helps a few rigs stay alive. If anyone feels like tossing me a coffee tip for the time I spent modeling/testing, I’d appreciate it, but no pressure at all.

I have no energy for studying, making the bed, have breakfast or going outside.
My working contract has finished and I thought that I was feeling this way because of work, but I was delusional.
I just want to sleep whole day and dont know what else to do.
I should study for exams but I have no mental energy to sit and studying.
I get anxious because when I am reading or listening to something it feels like I am not able to fully understand or memorize it, and I end up procrastinating and doomscrolling whole day.
I am pretty sure I am suffering from OCD cause I have been suffering from Retroactive Jealousy in my last relationship, and I couldnt stop ruminating about my gf's past and other stuff.
Also I easily get obsessed and anxious about whatever I am doing, especially about look, which made me thinking I also have Body Dysmorphia.
Next week I booked a session with a psychiatrist specialized in OCD treatments.
I just want to get out of this bad cycle I got in, because it is slowly killing me.
I reached a point where everything became too difficult and I really have no interest or energy to make myself doing it.. It is like not being able to function like a normal person and I dont know the reason.

I’m worried about canceling plans since my boyfriend doesn’t really understand IBS 😑. Is it normal for the pain to stick around even after you go?

Also, I’m also ovulating so i thought it could be either or (the ovary pain and IBS pain feel SO similar to me). So i took 3 Advil earlier today which didn’t do much. Tried a little coffee to get things moving (I usually avoid it because it gives me diarrhea, but it worked). I’ve pooped 3 times now but the cramps keep coming back. Not severe, just nagging and uncomfortable. Hoping this is just my gut settling after being backed up all week.

I’d like to leave where this goes as open. If theres attraction, mystery, and a spark I’m sure we’ll push things a little further than just friends.

Not looking to rush into anything anytime soon. Let’s get to know each other a bit, meet over a coffee/boba and see if we vibe first. I have an endless list of cafes I want to check out around the city. 

Tall, dark, and handsome. 6’ Toronto born and raised. Living in the west end and can drive anywhere, tattoos, fashion sense, work full time, hygienic, clean, confident and attractive. Kink friendly and dominant but reserve that for later discussions. I’m respectful of your time and boundaries, value communication and your safety is always important to me.

In my spare time you can catch me reading in the park, hiking and listening to my playlists, at the gym, or at events around the city. Recently was at the System of a Down concert. I try not to get into gremlin indoors mode until at least the first snowfall.

I don’t really have many requirements of you tbh. 25+, single, emotionally available, funny, free time, and a willingness to try new things would be great. I do have a soft spot for sweet and bubbly personalities. A similar taste in music in the fastest way to get my attention aside from a tray of banana muffins. 

Here’s some of the fall outings I have in mind 

Pumpkin carving • Apple picking • Fall picnics • Baking with seasonal ingredients • Haunted houses and corn mazes come Oct • Small town day trips • Cafe crawls • Speak easys • Reading nights inside • Farmers markets • Hikes when the leaves change colors

1n9g9jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATcruises/comments/1n9g9jl/ritzcarltonluminara_review_7day_mediterranean/,Ritz-Carlton/Luminara review (7-Day Mediterranean Cruise),"My wife and I just returned from a 7-day Mediterranean cruise on the newest Ritz-Carlton ship Luminara, and it was a ten out of ten experience. We were in a Terrace Mid Suite, one of the lowest-level room categories, and it was more than enough space for us (we even stored our suitcases in the closets and there was still enough room for our clothes… And then on the last day, we found out they they could have stored our suitcases elsewhere for us!). We were on deck 7, sound issues were non-existent, we didn’t hear our neighbors at all. Motion-wise, we felt a little rocking as we cruised a couple of nights, but I actually liked it, I found it very soothing, we had no trouble sleeping.
Overall, we found it to be an exceptional trip, and we are not regular cruisers because the mass cruising scene is not our vibe… But this was fantastic. There were people around, but it never felt crowded (we were told that the boat was at around 80% occupancy). We spent time at both pools (front of the boat on Deck 5 and back of the boat on Deck 10), and they were both pretty chill… The pools are relatively small, so you’re not getting more than 15 people in at a time, MAYBE 20, maximum. So it was never rowdy/noisy.
The food was excellent, we ate at all the restaurants, and honestly everything we ate was really, really great (and we are foodies, so we came in with relatively high standards, and even still were pleasantly surprised at how good it all was).
The level of service was beyond… Everyone has a suite ambassador and you call them for anything you need, restaurant reservations, more towels/hangers, more beverages in your room fridge (they will ask you ahead of time, and stock your fridge with your fav booze/soft drinks). And all the other staff, guest services, restaurant workers, EVERYONE was kind, friendly, personable, and sincere. There was zero attitude or indifference, they all seemed very happy to be working there. 
The suite design was very nice, lots of storage, more than enough room… But we didn’t even spend much time there, just to change, sleep, etc. We thought about upgrading to a room with a larger deck, but I’m telling you, we hardly used our deck… It was nice, we would go out in the morning to see our new port/destination, we had coffee/breakfast there a couple of times, but we enjoyed being on the pool decks more, there was more room, and it was more social.
The other passengers were very nice, we chatted with lots of people, did some excursions with couples we meet, and even made a really good couple friend that we will definitely visit/hang out with again. Average age range was mostly 55-60ish, with a few younger, and a few older. A couple of people brought young kids, and there were a couple of teenagers, but by far it was mostly couples/groups/adult families. (FYI, my wife and I are mid-50s and felt very comfortable/“normal”) among the passengers on board.
Entertainment wise, there was live music every night (good musicians/singers, better than I expected), but think of it as more cabaret as opposed to a club/party… There’s also a DJ every night at 10:30, but honestly we only made it to that once! Those both happen in the Living Room, which is a nice lounge area, it probably gets a crowd of 50-60 people a night, it’s a fun vibe, but it’s not a big party every night.
We honestly didn’t really have any complaints, and we can be critical, especially when someone is selling and (supposedly) providing luxury goods/services… If I had anything negative to say, believe me, I would. Actually, the ONE thing I will say is, we booked a few excursions ahead of time, and a couple of them were cancelled before the cruise left, and some had time changes… Who knows if that’s the boat’s issue, or the providers, or a combination of both. Just be prepared for that. We ended up doing a combination of excursions with that boat, and some one our own, and we liked the combo. Sometimes it’s fun to plan your own adventure and control your own timing, itinerary, etc, and sometimes it nice to let someone else do the work and just enjoy being shuttled around.  
By the way, we were told that they don’t ever discount the room rates ahead of time, as they never want this to feel like a “discount” experience… However we did hear that they will do on-site discounted room upgrades, so there’s a chance you could get a suite upgrade at a reduced cost if you want to roll the dice. But honestly, we were in basically the lowest level room, and it was great.

**Why nutrition matters for sleep:**

* **Sugars & refined carbs:** Spike blood sugar and disrupt melatonin production → harder to fall asleep.
* **Proteins & healthy fats:** Contain tryptophan (needed for serotonin & melatonin) and stabilize blood sugar → support deeper sleep.
* **Caffeine & alcohol:** Caffeine delays sleep; alcohol may help you fall asleep but reduces deep sleep.
* **Key nutrients:**
   * **Magnesium** (almonds, spinach, cashews) → relaxes muscles & nervous system
   * **Vitamin B6** (banana, potatoes, chicken) → boosts serotonin
   * **Omega-3s** (salmon, chia seeds, walnuts) → support melatonin production

**Foods to focus on:**

* Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
* Nuts & seeds (almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, chia)
* Whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa)
* Light proteins before bed (yogurt, peanut butter, eggs)
* Fruits with tryptophan (banana, kiwi, pineapple)

**Foods to limit/avoid:**

* Coffee & caffeinated tea after \~3 PM
* Sugary snacks & desserts before bed
* Heavy, fried meals late at night
* Alcohol & caffeinated sodas

The Gaggia is leaking towards the back with any grind using the new portafilter basket, and anything below 20 using the stock portafilter and basket.

I’m guessing there’s not enough pressure from the Gaggia so it’s backing up when pulling the shot with the finer grind and a better basket.

The submariner sweater's journey from naval necessity to civilian style is an unexpected tale of practicality, proving that sometimes the boldest fashion statements are the ones that run silent, run deep.

[Daily Rum Ration](https://preview.redd.it/1xs1fh2orenf1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d4aa00448b9560040aec11db0236135d3c64eb9)

# Origins in Naval Tradition: How to Look Good in Fish Guts

In the mid-19th century, British sailors were bobbing around the frigid North Atlantic,  fishing for cod and mackerel. These salty dogs needed clothing that could keep them warm and relatively dry. Enter the early fisherman's sweater – thick, oiled wool that could deal with ocean spray and retain heat even when wet. Wool's natural lanolin and scaled fibers can form a water resistant material, the perfect knit before modern Gore-Tex or Cordura.

[Various Styles of Gansey ](https://preview.redd.it/u7wh3asjsenf1.jpg?width=812&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52ec806537c1aa24f8e606a96fa674b5b96037ad)

The design was born from pure maritime pragmatism. The close-fitting silhouette prevented dangerous tangles with ship equipment, long sleeves could be rolled up when hauling ropes, and the distinctive rolled collar could be pulled up to protect against beard biting winds and cuffs that could be pulled down with thumb holes, to protect (un-tattooed) hands. Distinct from the Aran sweater the ""Gansey"" used basket weave patterns of varying types were used and denoted the sailors home town knitting style.

**Journey to The Extremes: Heroic Wool and Wastelands**

Whilst the early roll-necks were often hand-knitted for fishermen and sailors, they also made their way to the edge of the world, worn by Ernest Shackleton on his voyages to Antarctica in 1907-21. A basketweave pattern was often sewn with an handsewn additional kangaroo pocket and with necks of various depths of “roll”. worn under Burberry gaberdine outerwear against wind.

[Shackleton and Crew aboard the Nimrod - Note the Differing Weaves and Added Pockets](https://preview.redd.it/plnizsygqenf1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=fccc1679251a9979960c78a5e01faab25b1844ab)

Tested in the most extreme environments by the toughest men, the most lauded being Antarctic explorer Tom Crean. Through snow, ice and polar conditions, Crean rescued two injured and exhausted comrades, pulling them 65 miles on a broken sled and then hiked solo for 18-hours with little rations to find help. A feat for which he was awarded the Albert Medal in 1913.

[Tom Crean-1913](https://preview.redd.it/b1t89zs5qenf1.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fd50e328e42b8669512ac30e69773f41dc812d8)

**The Submarine Connection: Dive, Dive, Dive**

Having been proven in the most harsh of conditions the sweater was adopted by the British Military. The first version of the jumper was ordered by the War Office for use by the British Navy in 1913, when it was issued to the crewmembers serving aboard British E-Class submarines. A simplified pattern was adopted, away from the ""fancy"" gansey with ease production being tantamount.

[1939 - Note the Initials WT ](https://preview.redd.it/m8dc6emfrenf1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ea833ab0aac9d29a61f978b5ec1335cc918f9bc)

Conditions aboard the early subs were known to be some of the most primitive and notoriously harsh. The sweater was more a necessity than a luxury. Used extensively as an official piece of kit during that war, and its design remained largely unchanged. But it wasn't until WW2 that the sweater became such an icon.

[Rolled Up in A Tin Can](https://preview.redd.it/df2hwzpxsenf1.jpg?width=438&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=167f02874a63bbc9a35b521f38bc9da3486e0219)

The Royal Navy, U.S. Navy, and other maritime forces recognized the Submariner Jumper’s worth. Comfortable enough to work and sleep in but hardy enough to protect crews surfacing in the frozen winds of the North Sea. Both above and below the waves. The now longer rolled collar could be adjusted for different conditions – worn down for mobility during routine operations or pulled up for protection during surface watches in harsh weather.

Aside from warmth and water resistance, wool provided natural microbiological properties, crucial in environments where regular washing was impossible. Need warmth? Aye . Moisture-wicking? Aye, aye. Can it survive being worn for weeks without washing? Aye aye sir. unwashed and under attack the WW2 submariner embraced the piratical persona in a wooly jumper.

**Fly Boys and Comfort Knitters: Home Front Supply**

In WW2 the roll-neck was a major part of the uniform not just for submariners but Arctic Convoys, North Sea Battleships and co-opted by RAF pilots, who wore them under flight jackets when extra warmth was called for. 

[Robert Shaw in \\""Battle of Britain\\"" - 1969](https://preview.redd.it/4kueujlppenf1.jpg?width=301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4776773f652bbf27b88cb399aea380529fd8daed)

RAF pilots, stationed at home in Blighty, had some of their kit knitted by volunteers in local knitting groups and guilds, on behalf of The Royal Air Force Comfort Committee. Known as “Comforts” these sweaters were in AirForce Grey/Blue and some times ecru and are a lesser known cousin to the submariner sweater.

[Knit Your Bit for The War Effort](https://preview.redd.it/sdfokrzsoenf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e89dded2973b500c23fc6c5e64aaaa7325f7b1c6)

By April 1943, there were between 6,000 and 7,000 knitting groups across Britain. All knitters were volunteers using knitting patterns approved by both The RAF and later The Admiralty.  The wool, generally blue or cream, was supplied by weight free of charge to the individual households or knitting groups. This was often carried out by the ladies of the Women's Voluntary Services.

**The German U-Boat Sweater : Sea Wolf Style**

As an aside to the allies' winning wooly wear, we can leave it to the Germans to claim to engineer a better submarine sweater. The Kriegsmarine's U-Boot-Pullover, presented a blue or grey wool, a shorter collar height, brass quarter zip and ribbed  construction. German textile companies, including Heinrich Kretschmer's Hamburg operation, cranked out thousands and after the war, these surplus sweaters flooded the civilian market.

**Civilian Adoption: Ton Up Sweater**

Post-WWII, returning servicemen brought home an appreciation for hardy clothing, well made and inexpensive. The 1950s and 1960s saw civilians adopting surplus military gear that wasn't just functional, but also effortlessly stylish.

Motorcycle riders in the 1960s and 70s discovered that submarine sweaters made excellent riding gear. British bikers in particular realized that the same properties that kept submariners comfortable under water worked brilliantly under leather.

British rockers and café racer enthusiasts embraced the style. The rolled collar provided neck protection from wind that could, while the wool stayed warm even when damp from the ever grey British weather.

Mods too got a taste for the submariner look, making appearances in the classic British 1968 ""Kitchen Sink"" drama ""Up The Junction"".

**High Above Sea Level – Mountain High**

In a return to its icy heritage, climbers and hikers layered theirs under tweeds. As ever, they remained a favorite with explorers, and George Lowe famously wore a striped orange and ecru roll neck during the 1955-1958 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition along with other plan kinit versions seen here>

# Fashion Industry Embrace: High Fashion Meets High Seas

By the 1960s and 70s, fashion designers finally caught on to what sailors and bikers had known all along – the submariner sweater was quietly stylish, even making it to the pages of Paris Match.

# Movies and The Deep: Boot and Boat

The submariner sweater's transformation from military gear to style icon got a major boost from both Hollywood and Pinewood. The sweater's cinematic presence was cemented in World War II submarine films such as ""Das Boot"" (1981), ""We Dive At Dawn"" (1943) and the  father of all submarine movies but the obscure but brilliant ""MorgenRot"" (1933) following U21 in 1916.  where audiences could see the garment in action. These films showcased the authentic military heritage that made the sweater so appealing to post-war audiences seeking genuine, battle-tested style.

**Enduring Appeal: From The Endurance to the End of The Road.**

The submariner sweater's journey from naval necessity to wardrobe staple proves that the best style often comes from the most practical origins. In a world of fleeting trends and Instagram fashion, it represents something refreshingly authentic – clothing designed to actually work.

[Our \\""Uncle\\"" Bill - 1978](https://preview.redd.it/f7aqimwupenf1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ecd102da05edac8dbaccd1b7985b94bf3733a9f)

Its enduring appeal lies in its embodiment of values that never go out of style: simplicity, reliability, and a connection to maritime heritage. Slipping on a submariner sweater feels like a small act of rebellion against an overcomplicated world, a return to basics that somehow manages to be both nostalgic and contemporary.

It just needs to keep doing what it's always done best – keeping people warm, comfortable, and effortlessly stylish, whether they're, striking out over the frozen tundra, commanding a submarine, racing a motorcycle, or simply trying to look put-together for a Tuesday morning coffee run.

Across the web you will find many excellent reproductions from re-enactment suppliers (my personal favorite being [clan.com](http://clan.com) or for the u-boat [re-enactmentshop.com](http://re-enactmentshop.com)) many others produce these including the fantastic RAF Comfort model from [aeroleatherclothing.com](http://www.aeroleatherclothing.com) You will also find versions from the Royal National Lifeboat Institute [https://rnli.org/](https://rnli.org/) my personal favorite the ""Gold Top"" from [https://goldtop.co.uk/](https://goldtop.co.uk/) and very inexpensive from [https://www.militarykit.com/](https://www.militarykit.com/)

Many Japanese brands too including the usual McCoys etc, and even Mall Brands like J.Crew produce a serviceable version from time to time. Look for 100% British wool! Expect to pay anywhere between $60 to $150 and up to $400+ for cashmere, merino blends.

Yet, millions of people struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep, leading to fatigue, low energy, poor mental focus, and even weight gain. While there are countless supplements promising better sleep, very few address the **connection between sleep quality and weight management** effectively.

This is where **Sleeplean** comes in — a natural, scientifically formulated dietary supplement designed to improve deep, restorative sleep while supporting healthy metabolism. But does it really work, or is it just another overhyped product?

In this detailed **Sleeplean review**, we will explore its ingredients, how it works, real customer feedback, and whether it’s worth your investment.

# What is Sleeplean?

Sleeplean is a premium dietary supplement crafted to enhance deep sleep cycles and improve metabolic function during rest. Unlike conventional sleep aids that simply sedate you, Sleeplean focuses on restoring your **natural circadian rhythm**, promoting uninterrupted rest, and encouraging fat-burning processes overnight.

It is formulated with a blend of **herbal extracts, amino acids, and essential nutrients** proven to support relaxation, stress reduction, and metabolic health. By addressing the root causes of poor sleep — such as high cortisol levels, stress, and nutritional imbalances — Sleeplean helps you wake up feeling refreshed and energized.

**How Does Sleeplean Work?**

The effectiveness of Sleeplean lies in its **multi-targeted approach**. It doesn’t just help you sleep — it optimizes the entire nighttime recovery process. Here’s how it works step-by-step:

1. **Induces Relaxation and Stress Reduction** Sleeplean contains calming herbal extracts and amino acids that help reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) and promote the production of serotonin and melatonin — the brain chemicals that regulate sleep.  
2. **Supports Deep Sleep Phases** Quality sleep isn’t about the number of hours alone; it’s about reaching the **deep sleep stage**, where physical and mental recovery happens. Sleeplean encourages longer and more restorative deep sleep cycles.  
3. **Activates Overnight Fat-Burning** During deep sleep, the body shifts into repair mode and can burn stored fat for energy. Certain ingredients in Sleeplean help boost metabolic activity and improve insulin sensitivity, making it easier to manage weight.  
4. **Balances Hormones Naturally** Poor sleep disrupts hormones like leptin and ghrelin, which control hunger and satiety. By improving sleep quality, Sleeplean helps regulate appetite and prevents late-night cravings.  

**Why Use Sleeplean?**

Many people turn to coffee, energy drinks, or sugary snacks to fight fatigue, but these solutions only mask the problem. The real issue often lies in **poor sleep quality** and **hormonal imbalances**. Sleeplean addresses both, offering benefits that go beyond just sleep improvement:

* Promotes **natural sleep without grogginess** in the morning.  
* Supports **weight management** by activating fat-burning during rest.  
* Enhances **mental clarity, mood, and focus**.  
* Helps maintain a **healthy metabolism**.  
* Reduces stress and **improves emotional well-being**.  

For those struggling with insomnia, stress-induced weight gain, or constant fatigue, Sleeplean offers a natural, non-addictive solution.

I mean… I always thought you needed a fancy tech degree or like, serious “hacker” skills for this. But after scrolling Reddit all night (classic), I realized – nope. You just need a phone. MAYBE a laptop. That’s it. Zero experience needed. Why do I feel betrayed by the internet for not telling me sooner?!

So, in my caffeine-fueled quest, I discovered this — **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

Not kidding when I say it changed my views on side gigs forever.  
If you can click things, swipe stuff, and (occasionally) write “this button didn’t work” in a box, YOU can be a beta tester. (I was genuinely stunned.)

Here’s exactly how total beginners are starting:

- Apps ALWAYS need normal users to point out annoying bugs and awkward designs
-  
- You fill out super basic info on sites like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
-
- They send you a list of random apps needing testers – everything from shopping to weird productivity tools  
-  
- You get paid per test – some take only 10-15 minutes!  
-  
- Payment usually comes via PayPal (legit IMMEDIATE side money for coffee/ramen/sneaky Amazon binges)

And that’s literally… IT.

No trick questions.
No “upload your resume” BS.
No interviews.
They just want legit human feedback, not a robot or coder.

Why has nobody in my friend group ever mentioned this?? You could be making your TikTok doomscroll cash while doomscrolling.  
SOME apps want voice memos (“say what confused you”), others just want screenshots or written notes.  
But seriously, you’re paid to complain. Is this the dream job or what?!

And here’s where I completely freaked out: Some testers have made $100+ in a weekend, on their couch, in pajamas, testing apps they already kinda liked. You don’t need to be Einstein, just be curious (and maybe a tiny bit nitpicky).

TL;DR:  
- Stop doubting. Everyone can get started.  
- There’s NO special knowledge required  
- Try the one I found: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (it’s insane, I’m still not over it)  
- Get paid for your opinions, even if your only skill is “noticing when stuff looks weird”  

If I was confused and shocked before, I’m full-on hyped now. It’s the 2024 side gig nobody warned me about.
You’re seriously missing out if you’re not at least checking out   **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (just TRY it – you’ll see what I mean)

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tampa Bay Rays vs. Cleveland Guardians: A Tale of Two Offenses (and One Very Confused Umpire)**

The Tampa Bay Rays (-129) and Cleveland Guardians (2.3) meet in a September showdown where the only thing clearer than the odds is the fact that the Guardians’ offense could use a wake-up call. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB strike zone and the humor of a dugout full of stand-up comedians.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Implied Probabilities and Playoff Pressure

The Rays are favored at -129, implying a **56.3% chance to win** (per American odds math). For the Guardians (+230), the implied probability plummets to **30.3%**. But let’s not let numbers alone tell the story. Tampa’s 60.3% success rate when favored this season? That’s the statistical equivalent of a closer locking in a save. Meanwhile, Cleveland’s 43.6% win rate as underdogs is solid, but it’s like rooting for the “guaranteed to lose” lottery ticket—sometimes you hit it big, but more often, you buy a losing coffee mug.

The total is set at **7.5 runs**, with the over/under priced evenly at 1.91-1.91. Given Tampa’s 4.6 runs per game (13th in MLB) versus Cleveland’s anemic 3.9 (27th), this feels like a “low-scoring thriller” bet. Imagine a game where the Guardians’ offense is so slow, they’d make a sloth look like Usain Bolt.

---

### Team News: Rays Ride the Wave, Guardians Tread Water

The Rays are riding a **seven-game winning streak**, their longest of the season, and have closed to **two games of the AL wild card**. Their magic formula? A potent mix of **Junior Caminero’s 40 HRs**, **Yandy Díaz’s .294 average**, and starting pitcher **Ian Seymour (3-0)**, who’s as reliable as a sunrise in St. Petersburg.

The Guardians? They’re stuck in a playoff purgatory, 3.5 games back in the wild-card race. Their offense is so lackluster, **Jose Ramirez’s 26 HRs** might as well be solo acts in an empty stadium. Gavin Will

I was a really shy kid I also could barely read or write(I wasn’t really given a education growing up) so she would usually seek me out and talk to me help me write letters and such  this was our friendship all the way through 2019. I should mention she lived in a different country so we only saw each other during summer camp  fast forward to summer of 2021 my dad had just passed that may and me and T started texting daily during summer she would invite me to hang out seemed like we were becoming good friends I ended up developing feelings for her by the end of summer which I believe she noticed quite early on. Anyway after summer our texting slowed to more couple times a week maybe less and it stayed like this until march of 2022 right after I said I wouldn’t be working at the summer camp that year(the summer camp we meet at) she suddenly started taking months to respond she started avoiding me in person would reschedule hangs out indefinitely until she would eventually just stop responding   All this lead me to believe she didn’t want me around but didn’t want to be mean and tell me as such so Christmas 2023 I decided to confess my feelings knowing full well she didn’t like me mainly so I could move on and so she didn’t have to be the bad guy and tell me to F off basically. So it took about 6 reschedules to finally get a chance to talk to her and confess but before I could force the words out she said she knew I had feelings for her she let me down lightly by saying I probably liked you at some point and saying she was currently in a relationship so it wouldn’t work out  we talked for a bit and I ended it with I hope you live a good life this was me trying to say subtly it’s over you don’t have to put up me with anymore and I’d say during I talk I didn’t plan on coming to the summer camp anymore another hint towards our friendship being over
She responded with no don’t say that we will see each other again. I should mention I wasn’t sad while saying this tbh I was genuinely happy to have been rejected cause for me we could both finally move on. Cut to three weeks later she reaches out asking how I’ve been I was very surprised to hear from her I thought I’d never hear from her again especially not so soon after my confession. Anyway she reached out a couple times in the following months after my confession I’d always respond but keep it very casual and polite. But eventually 8 months passed without me hearing from her thought it was finally over but suddenly she texts me asking how I’ve been. A hurricane had just hit her college she school was out for a couple months and ever since then she’s texted at least once a month 

20 months after my confession she still texts me at least once a month I should mention I have never initiated contact or small talk with her once since my confession I respond nothing more we ended up working at the same summer camp together this year we would rarely talk and when we didn’t she always initiated all through summer I mostly ignored her/didn’t think about it 
That is until this last Sunday our two families are close so we had a big family dinner together  I left pretty early without saying goodbye and about a hour later she texts me say Irish goodbye. Classic. At this point I decided since she’s refusing to let me go and trying to some extent to stay friends I’d extend a olive branch so asked if she wanted to catch up grab coffee or something since we hadn’t talked one on one or caught up since Christmas 2023  and she immediately goes back to her vague non responsive noncommittal self saying sure we should then pulling out any excuse possible to not do it at this point I’m beyond confused and frustrated for 20 months I tried to move on she didn’t let me go now after I decided to actually try and be friends she goes right back to her same old vague zero intention of actually doing something but doesn’t wanna out right say no in fear of hurting me I guess so I decided enough was enough and blocked her without telling her she leaves to start college abroad soon so not like I’ll have to worry about seeing her

1n9g2px,https://i.redd.it/958fee0hoenf1.jpeg,Motivation after 40 isn’t about hype—it’s about strategy.,"A lot of people think they “just need motivation” to get in shape again. But the truth? At 40+, life is busier, recovery takes longer, and energy isn’t endless. Waiting to feel motivated sets you up to stall out.

Here’s what actually works:
	1.	Shrink the goal.
Don’t aim for a full hour if you’re struggling to start. Tell yourself “10 minutes.” A walk, a quick circuit, even some pushups. Small wins build momentum, and momentum builds motivation.
	2.	Use “triggers.”
Pair your workouts with something already in your routine. Example: stretch while the coffee brews, or hit a quick core set before your shower. This removes decision fatigue.
	3.	Track progress you can feel, not just see.
More energy in the morning, climbing stairs without knee pain, playing with your kids or dog without gasping—these matter more than the scale. They keep you coming back.
	4.	Set identity goals.
Instead of “I want to lose 15 lbs,” shift to “I’m the kind of person who trains three times a week.” That mindset shift is more powerful than any motivational quote.

-Big takeaway: Motivation isn’t the starting point—it’s the byproduct of action. Start small, stay consistent, and let the wins fuel you.",0,1757104053.0,primetime40comeback,0,0.5,False

Four party sources and two from the extreme separatist church confirmed for the first time the scale of the operation in the months leading into the May 3 federal election, and how deeply enmeshed Brethren elders were in Liberal campaign teams in marginal seats.

The extent of the involvement worried some Liberal campaigners so much they said they had hoped their side would lose.

“I’m glad we didn’t win because … I was scared about what that would have meant,” one experienced Liberal official told this masthead, speaking anonymously because they were not authorised to be quoted.

“So many of our candidates would have been beholden to the Brethren – and I think they would have made policy demands,” a second party campaigner said. “You don’t put that sort of money in if you don’t want something. You want control of the morality of the country, the views of the government.”

Former Liberal senator Linda Reynolds told this masthead that it was “highly implausible that this was not co-ordinated at the highest levels of the party and the Brethren”.

The Brethren’s unprecedented election effort, and the behaviour of some members at polling booths, will come under scrutiny from the government’s joint standing committee on electoral matters, which announced the terms of reference of its inquiry on Tuesday.

Special Minister of State Don Farrell has asked the committee to examine the “purported increase in incidents of aggressive conduct” during the campaign, and to consider “reforms to address the ongoing threats of interference … both foreign and domestic”.

Committee chairman Jerome Laxale has previously complained about the Brethren’s activities in his electorate, saying their mass presence at polling booths had been “one of the strangest and most offensive experiences I’ve ever gone through as a candidate”.

On Tuesday, announcing the committee’s terms of reference, he called for evidence from the public nationwide. He did not mention the Brethren specifically, but said “a line was crossed” this year, particularly in marginal and target seats with a co-ordinated campaign.

“Without a doubt, what we saw in 2025 was an escalation ... and we do not want that to become normalised. We need to protect our democracy and not have any domestic or foreign interference,” he said.

Reynolds was the first in the party to publicly raise concerns and has asked Liberal elders Nick Minchin and Pru Goward to investigate them in their review of the party. A review spokesperson confirmed the issue was under consideration.

The party’s federal director, Andrew Hirst, declined to comment, and Dutton did not respond to a request for comment. Both Dutton’s office during the campaign and the Brethren denied high-level co-ordination of the campaign effort.

Members of the church, formerly known as the Exclusive Brethren, generally do not vote. World leader, Sydney businessman Bruce Hales, preaches that his followers must “get a hatred” for society, which he says will defile and contaminate them. He calls them “saints”.

    “You’d ask for $50,000 for polling, then [the Brethren member would] say, ‘Can I have a look at it?’”
    Liberal campaign official speaking anonymously.

Despite their so-called “doctrine of separation”, he and other Brethren elders have long sought influence over conservative governments globally, including by lobbying, secret donations and “under the radar” political campaigning.

During the campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church as a “cult” and demanded to know from the Coalition what the “quid pro quo” was for their support.

Neither political nor Brethren sources could pinpoint what, if anything, the Brethren would have wanted from a Dutton administration, but businesses and charities run by church members have multiple interactions with governments.

Businesses run by its members often bid for lucrative government tenders, the church’s public-facing charity, Rapid Relief Team, seeks and wins government grants, and the church relies on generous public funding for its schools. What they call their “community ecosystem” interlinks businesses with charitable entities, which rely heavily on retaining their tax-free status.

This “ecosystem” has been under investigation by the Australian Tax Office’s Private Wealth: Behaviours of Concern section for the past 18 months. One Brethren accountant has already been stripped of his registration as a tax practitioner for fraud and misconduct.

Hales, a multimillionaire Sydney-based businessman, met regularly with John Howard when he was prime minister.

The Liberal party’s current national Right-faction leader, Angus Taylor, has praised the church in the past and organised a number of grants for the Rapid Relief Team, which has provided food and coffee to Tony Abbott’s “pollie pedal” bike ride.

Taylor did not answer a question on the record about whether he had facilitated contact between senior Brethren figures and the party. He said the Rapid Relief Team did “outstanding work in helping Australians in need”.

The Brethren have campaigned and donated to the Liberal Party regularly in the past. But at this year’s campaign, their election effort was “turbo-charged”, according to a senior Liberal figure.

Brethren sources, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of ramifications, have revealed that businesses and individuals spent months working for the Coalition at their own cost and directed significant financial resources into Dutton’s campaign.

Liberal sources said the party gave Brethren representatives unfettered access to the proprietary campaign software Feedback, which is exempt from the Privacy Act because it is used by a political party.

Brethren members used the software from their own call centres, accessing its extraordinarily detailed profiles of individuals to make about a million phone calls to voters pushing for a Liberal victory, the sources said.

Party campaigners on the ground confirmed that each electorate was assigned a Brethren business leader, or co-ordinator, as well as two deputies, and dozens of ordinary Brethren members to carry out the work. The effort ramped up once pre-polling started, with 30 to 40 Brethren members flooding booths in the two weeks leading up to polling day.

Brethren businesses also poured what is likely to have been millions of dollars in donations into Liberal campaigns at the electorate level in what were considered winnable marginal seats.

A Brethren insider, speaking anonymously, said there was pressure from the church hierarchy to contribute and instructions to do so from various different entities, including family trusts, individuals and business entities, to keep individual donations below the disclosure threshold of $16,900.

This means the true extent of the funding will probably never be revealed.

A second church insider confirmed this: “I personally know large business owners who were handed bills exceeding $100,000 to cover expenses like charter flights, accommodation and other things.”

Because of the power the church hierarchy wields over the daily lives of its members, the insider said people “have no choice but to cough up the money”.

One Liberal campaigner from NSW said up to $500,000 had flooded in from the Brethren into some marginal electorates – which would have accounted for close to 100 per cent of fundraising for those candidates.

In return, the Brethren donors wanted a say over the campaign, the party sources said.

“The requests were just constant [from the candidates]. ‘Can I have another $15k, $30k, $80k for key seats?’ You’d ask for $50k for polling, then [the Brethren member would] say, ‘Can I have a look at it?’ $25k for a mailout? ‘Well, I don’t like what you’ve done.’ $30k for social media? ‘I don’t like the way you’re dressed in that video’ …

“They were very coercive and controlling of our candidates.”

A second party campaigner said: “It looked to me like the Liberal Party was prepared to sell the party.”

The two Liberal campaign officials confirmed that Brethren co-ordinators had requested access to candidate campaign diaries, as well as press release templates, details of where the candidates were working, and their plans.

“They absolutely were trying to run the place,” one party campaigner said. “They’d go and organise to clean our candidates’ houses, cook food for the family, babysit, mow the lawn, all for free. They’d say, ‘No, you’re putting yourself forward for democracy; we’re going to look after you.’”

On party documents and in phone conversations, the Brethren were referred to as “friends” or “the religious people”, party sources have said.

The details now emerging call into question the arguments of both a Brethren spokesperson and Dutton’s office during the campaign that there was no top-level agreement to secure this help, only individuals and businesses working independently at local electorate level.

“I knew it went all the way to the top because it was all so centrally organised,” said one party campaigner. “They pretty much had a line of connection – a direct contact into Dutton’s office, and the federal secretariat would come to us to ask us to co-ordinate with them, and we’d disseminate that to the candidates.”

This masthead has previously reported that a member of Dutton’s staff, Sam Jackson-Hope, was in charge of co-ordinating the effort. However, senior party sources have said they do not believe he negotiated the arrangement with the church.

Asked if the campaign had been co-ordinated by the church, Brethren spokesman Lloyd Grimshaw said it “didn’t organise anything, and certainly does not make political donations”.

“If individual members of our Church – or indeed any church – wish to be involved in the political process by volunteering or donating, it is a matter for the individual.”

However, one of the Brethren insiders said: “Do you really think in Bruce Hales’ ecosystem that an entire country of Brethren can take up to four months off work and be out in disguises (things that would normally result in excommunication), be out campaigning openly, be flying around to remote areas of the country and staying away all week in hotels to campaign, changing times of local church meetings to accommodate it, without it being centrally organised?”

Within the Brethren, sources have said the election campaign was referred to as “King’s business” – referring to activity being conducted on Hales’ behalf – or “secret service”.

In response, Grimshaw said he “can’t comment on every comment that every parishioner has ever made” and that it “sounds like they were having a joke”.

Under Australian electoral law, outside groups that spend more than $250,000 trying to persuade people during a campaign must register as a “significant third party”, which brings clear disclosure obligations. Charities are not permitted to retain their tax-free status if they are involved in party political campaigning.

Brethren entities run multiple, extremely wealthy charities.

Both Brethren insiders said there was shock at the top levels of the religion when the Liberal Party went backwards on May 2.

“It has had a bit of a cooling effect on their enthusiasm and belief in Hales’ infallibility,” said one.

“Everyone is so gobsmacked and gutted, due to the effort and expense, that no one wants to talk about it,” said the second insider. “It’s really hit people’s morale.”

Linda Reynolds, who ceased being a Liberal senator on June 30, said the church’s comprehensive and public activity during the campaign is likely to have compounded her party’s “so-called women problem”.

“It was unacceptable that we were associated with a group whose treatment of women, to me, is reprehensible and misogynistic,” Reynolds said.

She said a core problem was the expense of running modern campaigns, which led to financial vulnerability. This was not just a Liberal Party issue, but was “symptomatic of the wider problem all political parties have”.

“The teals have Simon Holmes à Court’s network, Labor has the unions, but the Liberal Party has no equivalent, which, I believe, makes it more vulnerable to organisations, both secular and non-secular, with deep pockets and political agendas,” Reynolds said.

Former Liberal campaigner and now consultant Tony Barry said a party could make a million canvassing phone calls, but they were “only as effective as the messenger, or the message”.

“If either is no good, it’s probably a net negative for the party,” he said.",16,1757103910.0,AustralianPolitics,7,0.91,False

Hello doston

I used to love trying out perfumes in SS or Lifestyle in malls, but I had no knowledge of the difference between EDT/EDP/PP. Have read a few posts on this subreddit and did some research so understood the jargons now.

Well just giving a short background so that you guys don't blast me for my mini noob collection. Would love to hear your advice and opinions. And before you read further, just want you to know that I am a beginner and can't really figure out the notes on my own, need to refer to Fragrantica to figure out, would love to hear how do you guys figure out the notes when spraying and then post settling.

# So let's check out my collection now!

**Row 1:** All these four were given by my gf *(she is from Saudi and gets it from there)* hence I have to love them all :) But I can do a relative comparison among them since all of them are given by her, so I would rank them as ***Trilogy > Al-basil Oud > Prime Black > Adept***. All of these last over a day as I use them as office wear - daily as well as on occasions.

**Deraahh Al-Basil Oud EDP** \- Pretty strong

**Adept EDP** \- Mid to wanna be strong - have not been able to figure out this one yet

**Caporal Prime black EDP** \- Light to mid

**Caporal Trilogy EDP** \- Light and best for daily use

**Row 2**: I bought these over a period of two years, some before I got to know about this sub and some post that (clearly you guys would know which ones I bought post joining the sub haha).

**Mercedes Benz Club EDT** \- I love this, it is strong and stays for a day and even longer on clothes. Has decent projection as well. This was my first frag after getting an internship. ***(8.5/10)***

**Casablanca Homme EDT** \- Got it from Bali. Use it post showers to feel fresh. Does not last or project well, in fact wild stone edge lasts better lol. ***(5/10)***

**Rasasi Fattan EDP** \- Got compliments for this one, OG suggestion from the sub. Is pretty light and love wearing it while going out during mid-hot to cool weather. Lasts for around 4-5 hrs and has good projection for the duration as well. Got it from Jiomart lol. ***(8.5/10)***

**Scuderia Ferrari EDT** \- This one is mostly a fake I got from Bali for barely 700rs since the original one has been discontinued and I have not been able to find it. It was my first ever frag that my mom got me when I was in 9th from Central Mall. (Row 4 last image is the first one I got) Will always my fav and OG, thanks to my mom's choice. ***(10/10)***

**CDNIM PP** \- Just got this today from Khanna bros, does not smell close to the CDNM EDT tester I got from Armaaf website. I was expecting it to be an intense version of the same but I am just disappointed rn since the smell was too sharp. ***(-/10)***

**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa EDP** \- Got it from Khanna bros few days back, using it as office wear right now and I like the slight coffee whiffs I get from myself. Lasted over a day and not really sure about the projection but mostly not that good. ***(8/10)***

**Row 3**: Some small bottles just to try out frags that I find in random places.

**Dior Sauvage Clone** \- This is an attar oil I think I am not sure. I got it from a random stall from a mall near my place. The smell is pretty decent and lasts more than a day with okay projection. Was for only 200 so good enough. It is light to mid in terms of strength. ***(7/10)***

**Azzaro Most Wanted Clone** \- (same as above) It is lighter and hence I love this one more. ***(8/10)***

**Zudio Capricon EDP** \- Bleh, just got cz I am capricon -\_- not that great, okayish in terms of smell and does not last more than 2-3 hrs. ***(6/10)***

**Zudio Cancer EDP** \- This one smells really amazing but has issues with performace :( ***(8/10)***

**CDNM EDT Tester** \- Loved this man, hence I got the CDNIM  PP thinking the Intense version would be even crazier but well. This does not project or last long maybe cz it is a tester but love the smell. ***(7.5/10)***

**Skinn Raw EDP** \- Got it from Nykaa, use it as post shower to feel fresh. Love this one but it barely lasts more than 1-2 hrs and same with projection. ***(7/10)***

**Skinn Knox Homme EDP** \- Got it from Nykaa and would recommend it for winter, pretty strong and lasts over a day with okayish projection for some time. ***(7.5/10)***

**Row 4**: 3 out of 4 bottles are finished except for the carlton intense.

**Zara Man Silver EDT** \- Love this one like really love it but it does not last long, good for only 1-2 hrs. Would love to get a version that lasts longer :( ***(8.5/10)***

**David Beckham Classic EDT** \- Love this one too, this was really amazing. But same problem of performance. Good only for 2-3 hrs. ***(8.5/10)***

**Carlton Incense** \- I got this as a gift and it smells like a perfume a girl used to wear in my college hence I do not like to use it at all. ***(-/10)***

**Scuderia Ferrari EDT** \- OG perfume given by mom and my first ever hence the best. ***(10/10)***

**Not in the image:**  
**Wild stone Edge** \- OG suggestion from the sub. Use it as my gym perfume, pretty good and lasts long enough. ***(8/10)***

**R&B essential wood** \- It is just a small bottle I keep in my office bag for backup. Is mild and does not last long, barely an hour or two but the smell is decent. ***(7/10)***",3,1757103670.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,0.81,False

**Simple heuristics (not a diagnosis—see a clinician for red flags):**

* **Lifestyle / slow transit:** rare urge, hard/dry stools, days between BMs.
* **Outlet / pelvic floor (“stuck at the exit”):** strong urge but can’t pass, narrow/pencil stools, straining, need to press/splint → ask about **pelvic-floor PT/biofeedback**.
* **Medication-related:** opioids, iron, anticholinergics, some antidepressants, calcium-channel blockers, aluminum antacids.
* **Rhythm change:** travel/jet lag, late dinners, irregular sleep/wake.
* **Secondary causes:** thyroid issues, diabetes/neuropathy, pregnancy, neurologic disease—discuss with your clinician.
* **Red flags:** blood or black stools, weight loss, anemia, severe/worsening pain, new constipation after \~50 → **see a clinician promptly**.

# Drinks that can help

(Pick 1–3 you tolerate; don’t do everything at once.)

* **Water on waking** (300–500 mL), then sip through the day.
* **Warm water / ginger tea** (gentle on a bloated gut).
* **Prune juice** 120–240 mL (sorbitol helps soften stool).
* **Kiwifruit smoothie** (2 kiwis + water/yogurt).
* **Psyllium in water** 1 tsp in 8–10 oz, then a full glass of water (keep 2–3 h away from meds).
* **Coffee or tea** (can trigger the gastrocolic reflex; decaf sometimes works too).
* **Peppermint or fennel tea** (gas relief; **avoid peppermint if you have reflux**).
* **Kefir or thin yogurt lassi** ½–1 cup (use lactose-free if sensitive).
* **Warm bone/veg broth** (hydration + comfort).
* **Electrolyte water** (after sweating/exercise or if low intake).

# Complement drinks with the following 

* **Timing (use the reflex):** water → first meal/warm drink → **sit 10–20 min later** (daily).
* **Mechanics on the toilet:** **footstool** (knees above hips), lean forward, relax belly, **slow exhales**; no straining.
* **Movement:** **10–15 min walk after lunch & dinner**; 30-sec hip circles each time you stand on desk days.
* **Meal size & texture:** smaller, slower meals; on bloaty days **cooked > raw** veggies; favor rice/oats/potatoes.
* **Soluble-fiber nudge (choose one for 7–14 days):** **1 tsp psyllium** *or* **2 kiwifruit** *or* **4–6 prunes** (with fluids).
* **Trigger audit (24 h “low-FODMAP lite”):** pause onions, garlic, beans, sugar alcohols; re-introduce later to confirm triggers.
* **Evening cut-off:** **close the kitchen \~3 hours before bed** (helps bloat/reflux).
* **Breathing/stress:** **3 minutes diaphragmatic breathing** before bathroom and at bedtime (inhale 4s, exhale 6–8s).
* **Smart aids (use on purpose, not forever):** **PEG 3350** or **psyllium** daily short-term (not both); **magnesium oxide 200–400 mg at night** only if kidneys are healthy; **senna/bisacodyl** for rescue ≤2–3×/week.
* **Escalate if needed:** no improvement in 2–4 weeks, persistent “urge-but-stuck” (ask for **pelvic-floor evaluation**), or any **red flags** above.",1,1757103664.0,GastroIntestinalCare,0,1.0,False

• Grieving the end longtime friendships where I was always the one putting in effort and they left me just like that.
• Have 2 longtime friends, one is good but busy so I don't see him that often, the other one (who hasn't been there for very much looking back) tells me out of the blue she feels left out but won't communicate clearly with me.
• Video chat once a month or so with a friend who lives far away.
• I have a few old coworkers I hang out with every few months, but I'm always the one messaging first and they mostly talk about work.
• Chat with my roommate in the evenings and we do activities together occasionally.
• Message my brother to hang out, but he's always busy or cancels (he lives 5 mins away and have hung out only 3 times this year)
• Trying to get back to the gym and going to a fitness class once a week, but not much opportunity to chat with others.
• Joined a social group on Facebook and organized a brunch and a craft night. Have 2 people I can call casual friends, but again I'm always reaching out first.
• Paid to attend a local event focused on meeting new people, but everyone came as a couple/friends and it was a bust.
• Recently started volunteering around once a week on a community farm which has been nice, but their scheduling is inconsistent and last minute.
• Do activities by myself like going to the beach, farmer's market, hiking, thrift shopping, community events, etc.
• See my therapist twice a month. Can't find any group therapy near me.
• Make small talk with cashiers.

When I first started there, I was going to school for politics and law, and if I were to go back, I would want to go for accounting. I want to do something that is similar in my field, but not necessarily business management. It would be in my best interest to go back and get my degree, but I'm worried about the financial aspect of it. With my salary, I don't know if I would get any financial aid. I have some current debts that I want to pay off, and my partner and I will be looking to purchase a home soon. I'm worried about having a big loan on top of a mortgage in the future. I'm just not too sure if it the student loans are worth the risk. I know there is a lot of talk as well with the current administration and education cuts, but I'm not really educated on that, and with inflation and everything, I feel like I'm feeling fear mongered",3,1757103444.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

Hey there :)
I’m 24, just moved to Mumbai, and trying to settle into this chaotic, charming city. Tall (6'3""), working in consulting, and hoping to meet someone I can share some genuine vibes with, no pressure, just seeing where it goes.

I’m into reading (mostly fiction and philosophy), love cooking when I have the time, and spend way too long picking cafés with the right kind of lighting and coffee. Museums, walking aimlessly in new neighbourhoods, and long, unfiltered conversations are my idea of fun. I enjoy exploring the kinkier side of life too, but always with respect, communication, and clear consent.

If you're someone who enjoys thoughtful chats, slow-burn chemistry, spontaneous plans, and you’re open to something that’s honest and fun, drop me a message. Happy to share pics and continue the chat once we find some common spark :)",1,1757103348.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

This might be a long post so please bear with me. I have been struggling for years trying to figure out why I am always tired, couldn’t lose weight and had high blood pressure even though I would work out 4-5X/week. I even changed my eating habits to incorporate more veggies, whole grains, fruit and protein. I had even given up coffee and soda because the caffeine would give me heart palpitations. So fast forward… I had all these tests done 3 months ago. I went and got a sleep study done - I was told that I had severe obstructive sleep apnea. I also went to the cardiologist and was told that I have a slight arrhythmia - my heart makes extra beats due to sleep apnea. Doctor said I’m young.. (36 years old) and that there is nothing on paper that is leading to me having a heart attack/stroke. Took them two months to give me the cpap machine and I’ve only been using it for about little over a month now. 

Why am I still dizzy? I had anxiety in the past but I could always manage it. However, since starting cpap my anxiety upon waking is at a 10/10. I can’t take a deep breath and I’m always on edge. It’s even making me aggressive. The fatigue is there even though I have more energy than I use to, I still feel like I am not seeing any improvement on quality of life and feel worse than before I started using this thing. I’ve tried addressing this to my cardiologist and pcp. Cardio said I have underlying issues and it’s just manifesting now that I am more alert and that I should seek out therapy and prescribed me propanolol 10mg to take the edge off. My pcp basically said to wait to come in to discuss these issues in person 😒… 

I am so paranoid about medication and feeling overwhelmed/hopeless and feel like giving up using cpap altogether. I feel as though everyone is looking and treating me as though I’m crazy and told to take a chill pill when I can feel my body not working the way it should. I use to be a power lifter in my 20s and I recently injured my spine two weeks ago trying to start this back up (it wasn’t due to lifting.. I slipped and fell in the gym shower 😂) but I had been told last year that I had bone spurs, osteoarthritis and degeneration… so yes I have a lot going on but I’m trying to see if anyone else has experienced the dizziness, severe anxiety, and overall not improving with cpap. Does this ever get better? Should I give it more time? 

I appreciate any and all advice 🙏",3,1757103328.0,SleepApnea,10,0.71,False

1n9fox3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9fox3,"5 years ago,he spilled my coffee. Recently he knelt down asking my hand","
Love line:
I still remember the day we met at Starbucks 5 years ago. He spilled his latte on my white shirt. Fast forward 5 years later, in the same shop, he suddenly knelt down on one knee,
took out this ruby ring as and said, ""Marry me!”

When I was proposed to last month, I stared at this fiery ruby ring on my finger for three seconds
in a daze — it wasn't a traditional diamond, but it made my heart flutter more than any ring!
It's interesting to say that the movie we watched on our first date was Moulin Rouge!, and Nicole Kidman's line ""The most precious thing in the world is not diamonds, but love"" became our love motto. This ruby is just like our 5-year relationship — the more it settles, the richer it becomes, radiating warm and fiery red light in time.
Our journey for finding the right could be summed up this way:
Not all red stones are called rubies. We learned to look in natural light (mall lights are no good). Rubies are cool-toned red and more eye-catching, while pomegranates are darker in color. If you're afraid of being scammed, be sure to ask the seller for a certificate!
The setting is particular: I tried platinum and yellow gold, and finally found that 18K gold four tongue set! The drop diamonds on both sides are a nice finishing touch — not
stealing the spotlight from the main stone, but indispensable!
We decided that Buying online is more cost-eﬀective than from a shop… Online brands directly connect with the supply
chain, and rings of the same quality (such as 1 carat, G color, VS1 clarity) can save 30% of the
budget. The money I save can upgrade our honeymoon set.
Regarding cutting, the oval brilliant cut (the most popular, can make fingers look slimmer)
