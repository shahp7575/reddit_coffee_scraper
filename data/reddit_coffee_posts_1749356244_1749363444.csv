1l65cka,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1l65cka/40_samples_review/,40+ samples review ₊˚⊹🍰🍓⊹˚₊,"⭐️ **Rating scale**

* 5/5 LOVEEEEE, would wear often
* 4/5 Like, would wear occasionally 
* 3/5 Nice, but wouldn’t wear 
* 2/5 Not for me
* 1/5 Something is not right

Samples are from Surrender to Chance! 

# 🍵 Matchas 

**Sorcellerie Match Made in Heaven:** IMO most of the gourmands from this brand have the same DNA with only a little difference. Hope someone knows what I mean. This was no exception, except for a fleeting 10 seconds of matcha in the beginning. Still, it’s a lovely sweet scent and I’d like to think that this version of the sorcellerie dna is more grounded and “calmer” than the others. 4/5

**D’Annam Matcha Soft Serve:** now THIS is matcha!! A very rich, high quality, GREEN and earthy matcha. I don’t get any soft serve at all. But soon it gets a very alcohol/perfumey smell that reminds me of Elizabeth Arden green tea, which I really don’t like (it reminds me of deodorant). 4/5 for the matcha bit, 1/5 for the rest.

**Maison Margiela Matcha Meditation:** Just like D’Annam, but instead of 100% matcha overtaken by 100% deodorant, this is a mixture of 80% matcha and 20% deodorant. 2/5

**Kilian Princess:** I don’t get any sweetness at all?? 2/5

# 🍦 Vanilla and Sweets:

**Dedcool Mochi Milk:** This was interesting. Like others have said, I didn’t get any mochi from this. It smelled like toasted sugar, similar to Tihota or Vanilla Bean Noel from Cocoapink. But slightly less nauseating. I kept getting whiffs of this all day and I surprisingly didn’t get tired of it. 4/5

**Philosophy Fresh Cream:** FINALLY trying this after months of reading about it here and I LOVE IT!!!! This is whipped cream, nothing else, just cream. Yes. YES 5/5

**Philosophy Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere:** this smells like the BBW champagne toast hand sanitiser I used to have. It’s not like Fresh Cream at all. 3/5

**Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth:** contrary to the name suggests, this is not nauseatingly sweet. I’m bad at picking out notes and this is especially hard to smell. It’s a very sophisticated sweetness. 4/5

**Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth Me Espresso:** I don’t get… any coffee? I can only smell a sweet artificial fruity blend. 3/5

**Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth Caramel Dream:** Again, the caramel isn’t obvious. I can pick out marshmallow. It’s a very soft and enveloping scent. Similar to Sweet Tooth, but I like this more. 4/5

**Maison Mataha Escapde Gourmande:** a really nice vanilla but isn’t any different from the other ones I own. 4/5

# 🍰 Other foods:

**Poesie Village Bakery:** YES! This smells just like the japanese bakery near my house, specifically the milk bread. Love love love. However the sillage and lasting power isn’t great. Does anyone know any stronger alternatives? 5/5

**Poesie Soft:** hmm. I don’t get any rice at all. This smells vaguely like Village Bakery, and the strength is extremely weak. The cap wasn't screwed on properly and the whole bottle leaked into the box, but I still couldn't smell anything. 2/5 

**Masque Milano Madeleine: I**NTERESTING! I’ve never smelled anything like this before. I definitely get the chestnut. There’s also something earthy that makes it slightly medicinal but you have to sniff hard. The drydown is feels so reassuring, like an older sister on a fall day. 3.5/5

**Death and Floral Crunchy Baguette:** I get a rich brioche note, exactly like the ones I used to buy as a child. Very buttery. I like it!! There's some almond in the background which makes it slightly alcoholy at the beginning but it goes away after a few minutes. 5/5

**Imaginary Authors Whiff of Waffle Cone:** Smells like caramelised sugar! Slightly smoky which gives it some depth. But you have to be told that it’s a waffle cone to smell that note. 4/5… upgraded to 5/5 because of how it lasted a whole day, a shower AND one night’s sleep!!!

**D’Annam White Rice:** I definitely get the rice. For a while, there’s something bitter. Then it gets a gluestick type of smell. Cool concept but not something I would wear. 2/5

**Snif Hot Cakes:** This is crazy!!! I can actually smell the pancakes, some berries, and maple syrup. Very realistic. 4.5/5

**Haus of Gloi Ghost Puffs:** WOW!! This is pure white chocolate to me. 4/5 I dabbed it over D’Annam Matcha Soft Serve and IT WORKS!!!!! MATCHA LATTE!!!! 5/5 but doesn’t last :(

**Sorcellerie Cookie Party:** plasticy caramel. :( would be great without the plastic. 2/5 

**Socellerie The Bees are Flying:** honey, dark and pissy at first. Dries down to a light honey with no piss, smells smooth and “round” with some florals in the background. 3/5

**Kyse Fici e Panna:** FIG! And nothing else. A very green fig. Sniffed my arm again after an hour and now it’s just vanilla and sugar. Will have to test again. ?/5

# 🥭 Mangos:

**Phlur Mango Mood body mist:** I did not like this. The mango wasn’t obvious and it smelled very “perfumey” and sharp. Like cleaning product. WAIT I remember what it reminds me of now, it smells just like the bottle of Diptyque’s Oyedo that we keep in the bathroom to spray after laying a particularly nasty turd. I guess that’s why I had such a negative reaction LOL 1/5

**Brown Girl Jane Carnivale:** This still has some cleaning product vibe like Mango Mood, but slightly toned down. The mango here is juicy but fades quickly. 2/5

**Stephane Humbert God of Fire:** again, Oyedo-like smell. Why do all mango perfumes need something citrusy? 2/5

**Xerjoff:** Like God of Fire, but woodier. Hmm.

**Vilhelm Parfumerie Mango Skin:** just like Mango Mood, mango-cleaning product. Typing this sadly as I eat a ripe mango. All I want  there a perfume that’s just pure mango?? 1/5

# ☕️ Teas:

**Poesie Twice to Tea:** oddly enough this opened with the village bakery note, then changed into a generic body wash scent?? 2/5

**Hexxenacht London Fog:** OOH! This is interesting. Tea isn’t the first thing that comes to mind if I smelled this blind, but once you’re looking for tea, you smell it. I also get a biscuit on the side. There’s also a sweet fruit note without being fruity?? I can’t describe it. 3.5/5

**Arielle Shoshana Sunday:** I don’t get any tea. It smells like overnight rice from the fridge, no sweetness at all. 1/5

**Arielle Shoshana Monday:** nothing but bergamont, then dries down to Imaginary Authors Yesterday Haze. 3/5

**Brandt London Fog:** First thought: PICKLES!! Smells just like Santal 33. Then the bergamont takes over, but in a mosquito repellent way. Dry down is a mix of pickles and bergamont. 1/5

# 🫧 Clean:

**Kenzo Amour:** this smells JUST like Petits et Mamans from Bvlgari. It also reminds me of Replica Bubble Bath / Lazy Sunday Morning. It’s like a soapy baby powder scent, very clean and soft. 3/5

**Diptyque L’Papier:** I was kind of let down by this. I don’t know what I was expecting, but this was a very peppery musk. It reminds me of Zadig and Voltaire This is Her but sharper.  2/5

**Montblanc Signature:** A smooth, fresh unisex smell. Gets sweeter after a while but reminds me of someone who wears it. 3/5

**Zadig & Voltaire This is Her:** Okay, why does everyone say it’s a warm cozy chestnut? This smells like the epitome of a “clean” scent. It reminds me of Glossier You, but I may be wrong since I only smelled You once a long time ago. Same with Dedcook Xtra Milk! To me it’s the cleanest scent ever (I use it specifically on hot days where I just want to feel as clean as possible) and I don’t get any milky notes. Is it just me?? 3.5/5

# Misc: 

**Snif Heal the Way:** This was a weird one. It was like a medicinal vanilla. My mom walking by said that she didn’t like it, and I have to agree with her. 1/5

**Snif Gentle Reminder:** I don’t know what I’m smelling. I don’t get the taro. It’s bitter underneath and reminds me of a massage oil. 2/5

**Diptyque Eau Delle:** a spicy, resinous scent, not my style. 1/5

**Nicolai Saint Honore:** a spicy scent that fades to a creamy scent. I can’t describe it. It’s not sweet but very… round? Just like how NAVA’s Opal Vanilla smells “round”. 2/5

**Serge Lutens Jeux de Peau:** A creamy wood with hay and wheat. Quite masculine, not my style. 2/5

# Next on the lookout for: 

* NUTTY perfumes! Specifically almond milk with no cherry notes. There’s this chinese almond tea that’s just pure creamy almond milk and smells so good, not like the watery stuff in supermarkets. Macadamia nut (SDJ ’71 is lovely but sometimes too sweet), walnut, any nut. 
* Oats!!! I’m addicted to oats. Sometimes I open my jar of raw oats and take a huff. I’ve tried Zoologist harvest mouse but there’s something medicinal about it. I just want something OATY.
* Waffles! Not waffle cone. Just like the buttermilk waffle part from Cocoapink Pumpkin Waffle Delight, without the pumpkin. Or the pancakes from Snif Hot Cakes but with less maple syrup and fruits. 
* And has anyone tried these? Demeter Macadamia nut, BPAL Dana O'Shee, Moonalisa's Mother's Milk",1,1749363426.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False
1l65alp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1l65alp/im_not_the_best_therapist_okay/,"I’m not the best therapist, okay","But I’ve found my niche. The average person is uncomfortable with death, but not me. I can talk about it all day, keeping my head at the right tilt, the proper amount of frown on my face. There’s an art to finding the right amount of nodding to signal that you understand, but not so much so that you appear to agree with their grief laden thoughts. I hit up support groups, hospitals, hell, I’d go to the morgue if they let me. It’s a grim business, but they’re just my kind of clientele. 

Tom was like any other parent experiencing their worst nightmare; outliving his children after a terrible accident. He was referred by a friend of a friend who thought he might need a safe space to land, aka my cheap ass sofa and box of bargain tissues. I listened to him drone on about the usual surface level shit for a few sessions - his heart hurts, he’s so sad - before I finally got him to get to the good stuff. 

“I know this is hard, but hard is the way through.” - I said, dutifully reciting therapist babble. 

“If you’re sure… I trust you.” - Tom sniffled. 

*Jackpot.*

I smiled empathetically, keeping the glimmer out of my eye, and slid the tissues and bottled water closer to him. 

“I’m sure. Sharing your pain makes it easier to carry. Let me hold some of these feelings with you.” I said, another cliche I’ve said countless times. 

Tom takes a swig of water before he describes the accident; a horrible, unexpected fire that took away everything - his wife, kids, house, his whole life. How he almost didn’t make it out when the roof collapsed. 

“…and I just lay there, thinking ‘I could let go and be with them. I don’t have to crawl out of here.’” Tom says, tears brimming his eye lashes, gulping water after talking for 10 minutes straight. 

I resist the urge to roll my eyes. 

“That is heavy… let me ask you, why?” 

“Why what?” He grabs a tissue and dutifully dots at his eyes. 

“Why did you get up?” I ask, putting on my trademark frown. 

“I don’t… what?” He falters.

I stifle a sigh.

“Why get up? Why not just lay there and die like you should have?” I ask, more poignantly. 

“Oh… I don’t know… I guess it was just survival kicking in maybe…” The words come out but he’s not convinced, eyes half glazed.

“Do you think it was a mistake?”

“What was a mistake?” 

“You surviving.” I say, my eyes staring into his big brown ones, so wide and confused. 

“I - why?” He asks, glancing around the room as if he can’t decide if this is real.

“I mean… it’s not like you got a lot going for you Tim.” 

“I - it’s Tom.” He corrects me.

“Sure. Look, you don’t have your house. You’ve already blown through your life insurance. Genies cheating on you, what’s the point?” 

“Genies what?! Ho-ow doo” he slurs

“Ladies talk at book club. Listen, your life is meaningless. You know it, I know it, your girlfriend out there banging other dudes knows it.” I lean forward, ready to cut the shit. The hour is almost up, after all. 

Tom’s eyes fill with tears, his lip trembles.

“You’re right.” 

I smile, carefully laying the gun on the chipping coffee table. “You know what to do. You always have.” 

Thank god this office is in a bad part of town, or that gunshot may have interested the neighbors. 

It’s not honest work, but it’s mine, I sigh, looking at Tom’s sad body on the carpet. I grab the phony diplomas from the wall along with the drugged up water bottle and shove them in my bag, throwing the suicide note on the table and making my way out. 

It took longer than normal to find one this time and I am ready for a new place to sink my teeth into. I never worry about someone coming after me, after all, Tom doesn’t have anyone but his mistress left, and she’ll be too happy about the surprise large life insurance payout to worry about it too much. By the time they figure out she had nothing to do with it, I’ll be a few names away. 

Don’t feel too bad for Tom. He knew the risk when he lit that fire that night. Sure, he just wanted to be rids of his kids and wife, the idiot just happened to miscalculate the amount of gas and barely got out in time. His mistress Genie told me everything in that stupid excuse-to-get-wine-wasted-book-club, bragging about finally having him all to herself. Barf. She wasn’t cheating though, and I do feel a bit bad about that lie. I’ll make sure to anonymously send her a few bottles of wine as condolences, a secret apology.

It feels good to finally tell the truth, in this business of lies, even if it is just into the internet void. It can take me weeks to get to these shit heaps, and months before I can get them in the right headspace to pull the trigger, or take the pills, or yada yada. It feels good to share my accomplishment, even if no one ever reads this. 

But if you do happen upon it, don’t forget about people like me. Those who are watching, waiting for you to think you’ve gotten away with it. ",1,1749363215.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

From €94-a-night hidden gems to €2,000+ palace suites with Eiffel Tower views, the choices can feel absolutely overwhelming. But here's the thing: with the right guidance, finding your perfect Parisian home-away-from-home doesn't have to be a nightmare.

Paris in 2025 is experiencing a hotel renaissance. New boutique properties are popping up in unexpected neighborhoods, historic palaces are getting stunning makeovers, and the city's accommodation scene has never been more diverse. Whether you're a first-time visitor clutching a bucket list or a seasoned Paris lover seeking something fresh, this guide will cut through the noise and lead you straight to the hotels that'll make your trip absolutely unforgettable.

We've done the legwork—staying in everything from converted 17th-century mansions to ultra-modern design hotels—so you can focus on what really matters: planning the perfect Parisian adventure.

# Understanding Paris: A Quick Neighborhood Primer

Before we dive into specific hotels, let's talk geography. Paris is organized into **20 arrondissements** that spiral outward from the city center like a snail shell (or as the French say, like an escargot). Each has its own personality, and choosing the right area can make or break your trip.

The **1st through 8th arrondissements** form the traditional tourist heart—home to the Louvre, Champs-Élysées, and most iconic sights. **Le Marais (3rd/4th)** buzzes with trendy restaurants and boutiques, while **Saint-Germain-des-Prés (6th)** exudes Left Bank sophistication. **Montmartre (18th)** offers village charm and budget-friendly options, though you'll be climbing those famous hills daily.

Here's the insider secret: **location beats luxury every time** in Paris. A charming 3-star hotel in Le Marais will give you a more authentic experience than a sterile 5-star property in a business district. The metro connects everything beautifully, so prioritize neighborhood vibe over proximity to any single attraction.

**Pro tip**: Don't automatically dismiss hotels in the 9th, 10th, or 11th arrondissements. These areas offer excellent value and have emerged as some of Paris's coolest neighborhoods, packed with local favorites that tourists haven't discovered yet.

# Hotel Booking Tips and Pricing Insights

**Timing is everything**: Paris hotel prices fluctuate dramatically by season. **Summer rates** can reach €400+ for mid-range properties, while **winter visits** might score you luxury accommodations for half the price. Avoid the Christmas season unless you're specifically seeking holiday magic.

**Book early, but watch for drops**: Many travelers successfully rebook the same hotel multiple times as prices decrease. Choose refundable rates when possible, and set price alerts for your preferred properties.

**Consider shoulder seasons**: **May and September** offer the sweet spot of pleasant weather and more reasonable rates. You'll find smaller crowds and hotels that are eager to welcome guests.

**Location vs. amenities trade-off**: A smaller room in Le Marais beats a spacious room in a business district every time. Paris rewards explorers, so prioritize neighborhood character over hotel amenities.

**Budget reality check**: Expect to pay **€150-300** for quality mid-range accommodations in central Paris. Budget options under €150 exist but require flexibility on location or room size.

# Conclusion

Paris offers accommodations for every style and budget, from €94 cabin adventures to €2,000 palace experiences. The key isn't finding the ""best"" hotel—it's finding the right hotel for **your** Parisian dream.

Remember: the magic of Paris happens outside your hotel room. Choose a place that reflects your travel style, serves as a comfortable base for exploration, and enhances rather than defines your experience. Whether you're sipping champagne on a palace balcony or brewing coffee in a quirky Montmartre boutique hotel, your perfect Paris adventure awaits.

**Ready to book?** Start with neighborhood research, set realistic budget expectations, and don't overthink it. Paris has a way of exceeding expectations regardless of where you rest your head each night.",1,1749362657.0,TicketToEverywhere,0,1.0,False

But I can’t get this out of my head, and maybe some of you will understand.

Last year, I met someone. Laura.

I’m married. I won’t make excuses, and I’m not proud of it. My marriage has been dead for years, but I stayed because… well, life happens.

Laura and I met in an old café downtown. It started innocently — two strangers striking up conversations over coffee. We’d both show up around the same time on Wednesdays. After a few weeks of this, it became intentional. We started reserving the same table.

We both knew what it was turning into, but it wasn’t physical at first. It was something deeper.

I think I fell in love with her. I think she felt the same, though we never dared say it out loud. It was enough just to be. Wednesdays became our world. The only space where I felt alive.

She never told me much about her personal life, and I respected that. We had this unspoken rule: the café was a world apart. No questions about outside life.

Then last October, she didn’t show up.

I thought maybe something had happened at home. I texted her — we had a private email account we used too (she didn’t trust texting for obvious reasons).

No response. Days went by. Then weeks.

I thought maybe she had ended it the only way she could — by vanishing. I was heartbroken, but I tried to respect it.

Then I saw the local news: Woman found dead in her apartment. No foul play suspected.

It was her.

I went numb. I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. My wife didn’t even know I went to that café. My friends had no idea.

I mourned alone.

A month later, I got an email.

Subject: I miss you.
From: laura.wed.afternoons@gmail.com — the private account we had used.

I thought it had to be spam or a sick prank. But the message was simple:

“I’m sorry I couldn’t say goodbye. Please meet me next Wednesday at the café. Please.”

I told myself not to go. But I went.

Her seat was empty. I waited two hours. Left.

That night, another email:

“Thank you for coming. I was there. I’ll try again next week.”

This has been happening for months.

Every Wednesday, I get another message. Always late at night. Always after I’ve come home from the café.

At first, I thought someone had hacked her account. But no one else knew about it. Not even her friends, as far as I know. It was an account we made specifically to stay under the radar. We even set it up together in the café one afternoon.

No one else knew about Wednesdays.

The messages got more… desperate:

“It’s harder to stay connected. I need something of yours to hold on to. Please leave it for me next time.”

I know how this sounds. Believe me. I wouldn’t believe it myself.

But last week, I left a small note in her seat — a goodbye.

That night, the tone changed:

“Thank you. I feel you with me now. I won’t be alone anymore.”

Now, every Wednesday, I get a message. But it’s not just from her account anymore.

It looks like it’s coming from mine too. As if my account is replying. Automatically. Without me doing anything.

Subject: I miss you too.

I’ve checked my settings. Nothing’s automated. No drafts. No outbox record.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m losing my mind, if someone is playing a game, or if — somehow — this is really happening.

But I know one thing:
This Wednesday, I’ll go again.

And I’m terrified that one day, her chair won’t be empty.",0,1749362357.0,LetsNotMeetFR,0,0.33,False
1l6528k,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalHealthFinds/comments/1l6528k/can_a_natural_electrolyte_supplement_really_fix/,Can a natural electrolyte supplement really fix low energy and dehydration?,"I asked myself that exact question after reading about **Seaonic**, a marine-based **electrolyte supplement** made from cold-microfiltered seawater. I’ve tried hydration powders, trace minerals, magnesium blends - you name it. Some helped temporarily, but none really fixed the constant fatigue and foggy brain I’d been living with for years.

So, does it actually work? Here’s what happened when I gave Seaonic a real shot for six weeks.

**Why I was looking for something new**

I wasn’t training for a marathon or doing keto. I just wanted to feel normal again more energy, less bloat, and hydration that *actually worked*. Drinking more water helped a little, but I still felt dry, sluggish, and oddly thirsty.

That’s when I started reading about **cellular hydration**. Turns out, if you’re missing key **trace minerals**, water alone won’t hydrate your cells. It just passes through. Modern life filtered water, depleted soil, stress leaves most of us low on essentials like **magnesium**, **potassium**, **zinc**, and **selenium**.

**Enter Seaonic: what is it, really?**

Seaonic is not your typical electrolyte mix. It’s a **natural hydration supplement** made from **seawater collected from phytoplankton vortexes** in the Bay of Biscay. It’s filtered to remove heavy metals and microplastics, then packaged into **single-dose liquid sachets**.

What makes it different is:

* **78 essential ionic minerals**
* No sweeteners, sugar, or additives
* No powders, no mixing
* Already in the form your body can absorb

Basically, it delivers everything your cells need to **absorb water**, balance electrolytes, and flush toxins without any of the usual junk.

**What I noticed after using it**

**Week 1:** I took one sachet every morning on an empty stomach. Salty taste, but nothing unbearable. Within a few days, my usual 2 p.m. crash didn’t hit as hard. I wasn’t reaching for extra coffee, and I felt a bit more mentally alert.

**Week 2–3:** My digestion improved. I stopped feeling bloated after meals, and my brain fog lifted in a way I didn’t expect. Sleep got deeper too, no melatonin needed.

**Week 4+:** I added a second sachet on days when I worked out or felt depleted. I started recovering faster after exercise and sweating way less at night. It felt like my system was just functioning better overall.

**What makes Seaonic stand out**

Most **electrolyte supplements** on the market offer about 5–10 minerals. They’re often synthetic, and to mask the taste, they’re loaded with sugar, citric acid, or artificial flavors.

Seaonic delivers:

* **A full spectrum of 78 trace minerals**
* In **ionic form**, which means better absorption
* Sourced directly from the ocean
* **Filtered with 0.22 micron cold microfiltration** (removing microplastics and contaminants)

No extra stuff, just raw mineral support. It’s clean, concentrated, and surprisingly effective.

**If you want to learn more or see the ingredients for yourself, here’s where I ordered**:

If you want the science behind the hydration benefits, this breakdown helped me understand how it works:

**Would I recommend it?**

Honestly, yes if you’ve tried the usual stuff and still feel drained. Seaonic isn’t cheap, and it’s not sweet or fizzy. But it’s the first **hydration supplement** that felt like it actually supported my energy, mood, digestion, and sleep *at the root level*.

If you’re dealing with **chronic fatigue**, **bloating**, **brain fog**, or **dehydration** that water alone doesn’t fix, this might be the missing piece. It was for me.",1,1749362298.0,NaturalHealthFinds,0,1.0,False

[[Explore top Rated table linen size for 6 foot table on Amazon.]](https://blog.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=table linen size for 6 foot table)

## Key Features Analysis

The dimensions of your table are paramount when selecting the correct table linen. For a 6-foot (72-inch) table, the length and width are key measurements to consider. The table linen size needed will depend on the desired drop, which is the amount of fabric that hangs over the edge of the table.

**Table Size:** A standard 6-foot rectangular table measures 72 inches in length and 30 inches in width. These dimensions serve as the basis for calculating the appropriate linen size. Understanding these measurements is crucial for ensuring proper fit and appearance.The accurate dimensions help avoid too-short or excessively long linens that could detract from the overall aesthetic.

**Drop Length Options:** The drop length refers to how far the table linen extends beyond the edge of the table.Common options include a lap drop (6-8 inches), a standard drop (10-12 inches), a formal drop (15 inches), and a full drop (29-30 inches, reaching the floor).Your choice depends on the event's style and the desired level of formality. A lap drop is suitable for casual settings, while a full drop is ideal for elegant, formal occasions.

**Material Considerations:** Table linens are available in various materials, including polyester, cotton, linen, and blends. Polyester is durable, wrinkle-resistant, and easy to care for, making it a popular choice for frequent use. Cotton offers a soft, natural feel but is more prone to wrinkling. Linen is a luxurious option that adds a touch of sophistication but requires more maintenance. The choice of material influences the look,feel,and care requirements of the table linen.**Shape and Event style:** While the focus is on rectangular tables, the style can vary from casual to formal to high end. This range requires different approaches based on drop and fabric. Selecting the right linen is often based on coordinating all elements in the room to achieve a desired look. This may require trial runs prior to the event to ensure the right feel is created.

## Core Benefits

Selecting the correct table linen size offers several key benefits for your event or dining experience. It enhances the overall aesthetic appeal, protects the table from spills and scratches, and contributes to a clean and hygienic surroundings.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** A properly sized table linen contributes substantially to the overall look and feel of your event. Whether you choose a subtle lap drop or an elegant full drop, the right linen can elevate the table setting and create a more polished appearance. As a notable example, a full drop linen in a luxurious fabric like damask can transform a simple table into a stunning centerpiece. This will impress guests and add visual appeal.**Table Protection:** Table linens serve as a protective barrier against spills, scratches, and heat damage. This is particularly important for delicate or valuable tables that require extra care. By preventing direct contact with potential hazards, the table linen helps preserve the table's surface and extend its lifespan. For example, a waterproof table linen can protect against stubborn stains from red wine or coffee, ensuring that the table remains in pristine condition.

**Improved Hygiene:** Table linens provide a clean and hygienic surface for dining.freshly laundered linens help prevent the spread of germs and bacteria, creating a more sanitary environment for guests. This is especially critically important in food service settings where cleanliness is paramount. Using clean table linens demonstrates attention to detail and contributes to a positive dining experience for all.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about choosing the appropriate table linen size for a 6-foot table.

**What size table linen do I need for a 6-foot table with a standard 12-inch drop?**
For a 6-foot (72-inch) table with a 30-inch width, a standard 12-inch drop requires a tablecloth that is 96 inches wide and 116 inches long. This is calculated by adding twice the drop length to both the width and length of the table: (30 + 12 + 12 = 54 inches) x (72 + 12 + 12 = 96 inches). This ensures a balanced and visually appealing overhang on all sides of the table.

**Is it better to err on the side of a larger or smaller table linen size?**
It is generally better to err on the side of a slightly larger table linen size rather than a smaller one. A linen that is too small will not provide adequate coverage and may look awkward. A slightly larger linen can be adjusted to fit the table, and the excess fabric can be tucked in or draped elegantly. Though, avoid excessively large linens that could pose a tripping hazard or create an unprofessional appearance.

**Can I use a round tablecloth on a rectangular 6-foot table?**
Yes,you can use a round tablecloth on a rectangular 6-foot table,but the look will be different than a rectangular cloth. The size depends on the drop you desired. To calculate, you'll need to use use the diameter of the round cloth, ensuring it is at least as wide as the length of the table (72 inches plus the drop on both sides). The four corners of the table will be exposed, depending on the selected drop.

I’ve been going at this problem head on and really having a tough time at it. That’s not to say it’s not worth it and I haven’t made strides, it’s just that I feel incredibly stuck and without guidance. 

So, long story short, I have serious problems with intimacy since some formative experiences with I was a teenager + a disorganized attachment style. I’m pretty much completely inexperienced, save for a few brief relationships. I’m at the point that I know I’d be able to take appropriate action if I were put into an intimate position, but I tend to self destruct relationships when they get around there. 

The biggest issue is, I’m a man. I’m 26. I actually present quite well and the world has done a good job of letting me know of that. I have naturally very dominant body language, being tall and muscular. I dress myself quite well and groom myself appropriately, sometimes to the point of my sexuality being questioned. I don’t really mind that, since I’ve had male friends my entire life and not felt sexual tension or had fantasies about them once. People respond to my presence and I notice it these days. And above all, people do find me attractive and I have other external markers that indicate to me as much. 

So my solution to this was joining salsa classes long term. This has been absolutely transformational for me, as I’ve been able to get comfortable with so much touch. I’ve gotten better at flirting and I find myself completely lost in the moment every time I go in, no matter my prior state. I act almost entirely on emotional intuition and I let my heart carry me. 

I’ve also faced quite a bit of rejection, which I think I’ve very much needed to properly shape my ego. I’ve technically been on one date before a salsa social, and that ended with her not being interested. I don’t care to speculate as to why. I’ve asked two people on coffee dates and gotten two nos there. Neither were out of my league per se, just wrong time type of deals. 

The issue is… I chase unavailable. Whether that be someone not attracted to me or someone who just got out of a relationship or whatever. Then, when I get closer to actually succeeding, I do stupid shit that destructs the relationship. My most recent was I got pushy over text because I started feeling disgust in a woman (who was 44, by the way. The same age my mother during a particularly traumatic time). I think a big part of me knew that would be the end of our relationship, but I could also be intellectualizing that and I can cop to that. 

I’ve gotten a lot better at forgiving myself here while also correcting the behavior in the future as best I can, but still feel intense shame. I just don’t know that I can continue to act like I do and still be liked for the slow burn kind of guy I really need to be to build the trust required for intimacy.  In my most successful relationship, the courting process lasted like 3 months and largely because I was getting over the last relationship I destructed. Then I destroyed that relationship when I figured out she just couldn’t meet my need for touch. 

I also want to point out one last detail… everyone runs for the hills when they catch wind of this all. I despise inauthenticity, but I’ve found sharing too much gets me shut out. I definitely have the issue of over sharing without a doubt and I’ve worked to quell that. 

I’m not super sure where to go from here, but I do think I’m on a forward facing path here. I just think I could save myself a lot of negative emotion somehow and I’m hoping someone else has any advice here. Thanks",1,1749361916.0,emotionalintelligence,0,1.0,False

Once by mistake, put milk in the cup before plunging the coffee, and then found that this bubbles the milk a little. Nothing major, no froth, just some bubbling action.

Principal antagonizes teachers by walking into classes constantly to enforce piddly rules and preferences they have.

Principal contended they can walk into our classes whenever they want to for any or no reason.

Last week it was three times in the first period of the day.

1st time: check if students had to complete iReady

Yes. I separated them and asked the rest of the class to quietly work on their projects.

2nd Time: Came in, grabbed students' coffee drinks (they weren't drinking or opening them at all) and took them to the office in a huff, vocalizing the whole time.

Later, after most of the students had finished the iReady and shown me their scores....A counselor wanted to present something students need to do. Paperwork. To my knowledge, only on student was still working on iReady, so I let her present.

3rd Time: Interrupted the presentation to ask who still hadn't finished the iReady -- TWO students raised their hands.

In the hallway I tried to explain students had finished or shown scores...

""I DON'T CARE! Don't go by what they say -- use the system to check! This is the SECOND TIME...."" (I don't recall a first time).

I've already had an informal conf with District and Union rep present on Zoom where the principal lost her shit and actually threatened the Union guy and I with her getting a lawyer.

Her response to the conference was denial, though I have hard evidence she's lying. Union guy said ""Next time we present evidence.""

Spoke with Union chair who said, 
""She does that to everyone.""

It's disrespectful most of the time, and disrupts class, especially since she bursts in and starts yelling.

1l64p2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TicketToEverywhere/comments/1l64p2g/best_hotels_in_vegas/,Best Hotels In Vegas,"Las Vegas hits you like a lightning bolt the moment you step out of McCarran Airport. The neon lights, the constant hum of excitement, the promise of adventure around every corner – it's sensory overload in the best possible way. But here's the thing: with over 150,000 hotel rooms scattered across Sin City, choosing where to plant your flag can feel more overwhelming than picking your lucky numbers at the roulette table.

Your hotel choice in Vegas isn't just about finding a place to crash after a night of debauchery (though that's important too). It's about setting the stage for your entire Vegas experience. Are you here to live it up in luxury, party like there's no tomorrow, or maybe find that sweet spot between comfort and your credit card limit? Whatever your vibe, I've got you covered with this insider's guide to the best hotels Las Vegas has to offer.

# Why Your Hotel Choice Actually Matters in Vegas

Look, Vegas isn't like other cities where you pick a hotel just to sleep. Your hotel becomes your home base, your refuge, and sometimes your entire universe if you never leave the property (and trust me, at some of these places, you won't want to).

The Strip stretches over four miles, so location really matters. Staying at the wrong end could mean a 20-minute walk (or expensive taxi ride) to reach the action you're looking for. Plus, with resort fees ranging from $25-$45 per night, you want to make sure you're getting bang for your buck.

Here's what separates the wheat from the chaff: the best Vegas hotels understand that they're not just providing accommodation – they're selling an experience. Whether that's world-class dining, Instagram-worthy pools, or the kind of personalized service that makes you feel like royalty, the top properties know how to deliver.

# Luxury Strip Hotels That Define Vegas Glamour

# The Bellagio - Timeless Elegance That Never Gets Old

The Bellagio remains the most Instagrammed destination on the Strip, and honestly, it's not hard to see why. Those iconic dancing fountains aren't just for show – they're a symbol of Vegas at its most magical. Step inside and you're greeted by **Dale Chihuly's blown-glass flowers** cascading from the ceiling like something out of a fever dream.

The rooms here are pure luxury without being flashy about it. We're talking marble bathrooms with deep soaking tubs, Egyptian cotton linens that feel like clouds, and views that'll make you forget you're in the middle of the desert. The **Bellagio Conservatory** changes with the seasons, creating a living art installation that's completely free to enjoy.

Pro tip: if you're looking to splurge, the lakefront suites with fountain views are worth every penny. There's nothing quite like having your morning coffee while watching the water dance just for you.

# ARIA Resort & Casino - Where Modern Meets Magnificent

ARIA boasts one of the most eye-catching views with its curvlinear design that towers high above the competition. This place is all about that sleek, contemporary vibe that makes you feel like you're living in the future. The spacious rooms come with floor-to-ceiling windows that frame the Vegas skyline like a piece of art.

What sets ARIA apart is the attention to detail. Most appliances can be controlled with the touch of a button, and the **Forbes 5-star spa** is the largest of its kind in the US. The salt room and Japanese stone hot beds aren't just amenities – they're experiences that'll have you floating on cloud nine.

The location is golden too, sitting right in the heart of CityCenter and connected to Park MGM via walkway. You're literally in the center of everything that matters on the Strip.

# The Wynn Las Vegas - Where Opulence Meets Perfection

After a $200 million gut renovation completed in 2022, Wynn has a stylish new look while maintaining its reputation as the **largest Forbes Five-Star resort in the world**. This isn't just luxury – it's luxury with a capital L that's been bedazzled and served on a silver platter.

The Wynn feels more like an exclusive resort than a Vegas hotel. You've got the only golf course on the Strip, shopping at the likes of Cartier, Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Balmain, Chanel and Balenciaga, and restaurants that could hold their own in any major culinary capital.

What I love about the Wynn is how they've managed to create this bubble of sophistication that somehow feels both grand and intimate. The service here isn't just good – it's the kind that anticipates your needs before you even know you have them.

# Fontainebleau Las Vegas - The Newest Kid on the Block

Opening December 13, 2023, Fontainebleau Las Vegas brings a legacy of timeless elegance and unparalleled service to the Strip. This **67-story tower** is the tallest occupiable building in Nevada, and boy, does it make a statement.

Having only been open for 18 months, Fontainebleau Las Vegas is certainly making its mark on the city with more than 150,000 square feet of casino space and **36 restaurants and bars** that are all first-to-market concepts. The **6-acre pool area** alone is worth the stay, featuring multiple pools, cabanas, and even a gaming area.

What's really impressive is how they've created something that feels both brand new and timelessly elegant. The rooms feature floor-to-ceiling windows and contemporary wall art, while the **Lapis Spa** offers everything from salt caves to infrared saunas.

# Mid-Range Marvels: Great Value on the Strip

# Park MGM - Eco-Friendly Luxury Without the Guilt

Park MGM has quietly become one of the best values on the Strip. It's got a nice easy to manage footprint, good restaurants, and it's usually pretty budget friendly. The property underwent a massive renovation that transformed it into something special – think boutique hotel vibes with big resort amenities.

The location is absolutely killer, sitting right next to T-Mobile Arena (hello, major concerts and sporting events) and connected to the **Dolby Live concert venue**. Plus, you're walking distance to everything without the chaos of being right in the thick of it.

# The LINQ Hotel - Central Location, Party Vibes

If you want to be in the absolute center of the Strip action, The LINQ is your spot. Sure, it has a young party atmosphere, but that's exactly what some people are looking for. The **High Roller observation wheel** is literally in your backyard, and you're walking distance to basically everything.

The rooms are modern and comfortable, though nothing too fancy. But honestly, when you're spending most of your time exploring Vegas, you just need a clean, comfortable place to recharge. The LINQ delivers that in spades.

# Budget-Friendly Options That Don't Compromise on Fun

Let's be real – not everyone wants to drop a mortgage payment on their Vegas hotel. The good news? With so much competition in Las Vegas, some resorts offer cheap rooms in the hope that guests will spend big in their casinos.

**Excalibur** remains a favorite among budget-conscious travelers. You can't beat the Excalibur for Clean, budget friendly rooms, and its location at the south end of the Strip means you're still in the heart of the action. Sure, it's themed like a medieval castle (which some might call tacky), but it's clean, comfortable, and won't break the bank.

**Flamingo** is another solid choice, especially if you join the Caesars Rewards program. Flamingo, Linq, Harrahs and PH all also come within your budget and are decent properties in great locations. The location is absolutely perfect – smack dab in the middle of the Strip.

For the truly budget-conscious, **Circus Circus** offers some of the cheapest rooms on the Strip. It's at the north end, so you'll have a bit of a trek to reach some attractions, but the **Adventuredome** indoor theme park makes it a great choice for families.

# Off-Strip Gems: Hidden Treasures Away from the Crowds

Sometimes the best Vegas experience happens when you step away from the madness of the Strip. **Red Rock Resort** is the crown jewel of off-Strip properties, and it's where a lot of locals actually hang out.

Located 10 miles west of the Strip, Red Rock Resort is a four-diamond AAA-rated luxury resort that features 800 guest rooms and suites, a 25,000 square-foot spa, multiple restaurants, a spectacular pool area, and some of the best views in Vegas. You're looking out at actual red rock formations instead of concrete jungle, and the vibe is way more chill.

The **Station Casinos** properties are all solid choices for those who want to experience Vegas like a local. Palace Station offers the perfect combination of comfort, luxury and affordability, leaving no question to why it's known as the locals' favorite place to stay and play. Plus, you'll find **3:2 blackjack tables** and video poker with better odds than most Strip properties.

**Green Valley Ranch** offers a more upscale off-Strip experience with a European-inspired aesthetic. It's further out, but if you're renting a car or don't mind the occasional Uber, it's like having your own private resort.

# Choosing the Right Hotel for Your Vegas Adventure

Here's the thing about choosing a Vegas hotel – it all comes down to what kind of Vegas experience you're after. First-time visitors usually want to stay on the Strip to soak up all the iconic Vegas energy. Been here before? Maybe it's time to explore some off-Strip gems.

Consider your priorities: Are you here for the nightlife? Stay central on the Strip. Looking for a romantic getaway? The Waldorf Astoria or Four Seasons might be more your speed. Planning a guys trip or bachelorette party? The newer properties like Fontainebleau or something with great pool scenes like ARIA could be perfect.

**Timing matters big time.** Las Vegas is favourite destination for a US weekend getaway, so if you can steer clear of Friday and Saturday nights you can often bag a bargain. The same room that costs $100 on a Tuesday might be $400 on a Saturday during a big event.

# Pro Tips for Booking Your Vegas Hotel

Here's some insider knowledge that'll save you both money and headaches: **join the rewards programs** before you book. Whether it's Caesars Rewards, MGM Rewards, or the individual hotel programs, you'll often get better rates and room upgrades just for being a member.

Watch out for those **resort fees** – they can add $25-$45 per night to your bill and usually aren't included in the advertised rate. Always factor these in when comparing prices.

If you're flexible with dates, avoid major conventions, holidays, and big events like March Madness or New Year's Eve. Vegas pricing is all about supply and demand, and when demand is high, your wallet will feel it.

**Book directly with the hotel** when possible. You'll often get the best cancellation policies, and if something goes wrong, you're dealing directly with the property instead of a third-party booking site.

Vegas is a city that never stops evolving, and your choice of hotel can make or break your experience. Whether you're dropping serious cash at the Wynn, finding that sweet spot at Park MGM, or keeping it budget-friendly at Excalibur, the perfect Vegas hotel is out there waiting for you.

The key is knowing what you want from your Vegas adventure and picking a property that amplifies that experience. After all, in a city where the extraordinary is ordinary, your hotel should be nothing less than spectacular.

One of my personal dreams is to meet PG someday — just grab a coffee and chat for an hour. He’s a hero to me, and probably to thousands of founders around the world.

Having lived in the Middle East, I know firsthand the challenges, but also the incredible untapped potential there.   
I genuinely believe that a movement rooted in entrepreneurship could unify the region in a way politics never could.

I’ve seen it with my own eyes: Palestinians and Israelis deep in conversation about Kubernetes and kernel-level stuff. Pakistanis and Indians bonding over tech for hours. It’s always the builders, the founders, the hackers — they care more about solving real problems than perpetuating old divisions. There's something inherently optimistic and collaborative about entrepreneurs.

The Middle East has the rare combination of capital, talent, and deep ambition — the raw ingredients of a vibrant startup ecosystem. What it lacks is an ignition point. And YC — or someone with a similar philosophy — could be that spark.

But I can’t get this out of my head, and maybe some of you will understand.

Last year, I met someone. Laura.

I’m married. I won’t make excuses, and I’m not proud of it. My marriage has been dead for years, but I stayed because… well, life happens.

Laura and I met in an old café downtown. It started innocently — two strangers striking up conversations over coffee. We’d both show up around the same time on Wednesdays. After a few weeks of this, it became intentional. We started reserving the same table.

We both knew what it was turning into, but it wasn’t physical at first. It was something deeper.

I think I fell in love with her. I think she felt the same, though we never dared say it out loud. It was enough just to be. Wednesdays became our world. The only space where I felt alive.

She never told me much about her personal life, and I respected that. We had this unspoken rule: the café was a world apart. No questions about outside life.

Then last October, she didn’t show up.

I thought maybe something had happened at home. I texted her — we had a private email account we used too (she didn’t trust texting for obvious reasons).

No response. Days went by. Then weeks.

I thought maybe she had ended it the only way she could — by vanishing. I was heartbroken, but I tried to respect it.

Then I saw the local news: Woman found dead in her apartment. No foul play suspected.

It was her.

I went numb. I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. My wife didn’t even know I went to that café. My friends had no idea.

I mourned alone.

A month later, I got an email.

Subject: I miss you.
From: laura.wed.afternoons@gmail.com — the private account we had used.

I thought it had to be spam or a sick prank. But the message was simple:

“I’m sorry I couldn’t say goodbye. Please meet me next Wednesday at the café. Please.”

I told myself not to go. But I went.

Her seat was empty. I waited two hours. Left.

That night, another email:

“Thank you for coming. I was there. I’ll try again next week.”

This has been happening for months.

Every Wednesday, I get another message. Always late at night. Always after I’ve come home from the café.

At first, I thought someone had hacked her account. But no one else knew about it. Not even her friends, as far as I know. It was an account we made specifically to stay under the radar. We even set it up together in the café one afternoon.

No one else knew about Wednesdays.

The messages got more… desperate:

“It’s harder to stay connected. I need something of yours to hold on to. Please leave it for me next time.”

I know how this sounds. Believe me. I wouldn’t believe it myself.

But last week, I left a small note in her seat — a goodbye.

That night, the tone changed:

“Thank you. I feel you with me now. I won’t be alone anymore.”

Now, every Wednesday, I get a message. But it’s not just from her account anymore.

It looks like it’s coming from mine too. As if my account is replying. Automatically. Without me doing anything.

Subject: I miss you too.

I’ve checked my settings. Nothing’s automated. No drafts. No outbox record.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m losing my mind, if someone is playing a game, or if — somehow — this is really happening.

But I know one thing:
This Wednesday, I’ll go again.

And I’m terrified that one day, her chair won’t be empty.",1,1749360594.0,LetsNotMeetFR,0,0.6,False
1l64maq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1l64maq/catching_fire_2nd_part_outside_the_window_a_car/,"Catching Fire 2nd Part : Outside the window, a car comes to life, soft and quiet like the purr of a cat, then fades away into the distance. It slips off as it arrived, unnoticed. The room seems to be spinning in slow, lopsided circles, and I wonder if I might black out. I lean forward and clutch....","  “Please don't hurt Gale,” I whisper. “He's just my friend. He's been my friend for years. That's all that's between us. Besides, everyone thinks we're cousins now. I'm only interested in how it affects your dynamic with Peeta, thereby affecting the mood in the districts,” he says. “It will be the same on the tour. I'll be in love with him just as I was,” I say.  “Just as you are,” corrects President Snow. “Just as I am,” I confirm.  “Only you'll have to do even better if the uprisings are to be averted,” he says. “This tour will be your only chance to turn things around. “I know. I will. I'll convince everyone in the districts that I wasn't defying the Capitol, that I was crazy with love,” I say. President Snow rises and dabs his puffy lips with a napkin. “Aim higher in case you fall short. “What do you mean? How can I aim higher?” I ask.  “Convince me” he says. He drops the napkin and retrieves his book. I don't watch him as he heads for the door, so I flinch when he whispers in my ear. “By the way, I know about the kiss.” Then the door clicks shut behind him.  The smell of blood ... it was on his breath. What does he do? I think. Drink it? I imagine him sipping it from a teacup. Dipping a cookie into the stuff and pulling it out dripping red. Outside the window, a car comes to life, soft and quiet like the purr of a cat, then fades away into the distance. It slips off as it arrived, unnoticed. The room seems to be spinning in slow, lopsided circles, and I wonder if I might black out. I lean forward and clutch the desk with one hand. The other still holds Peeta's beautiful cookie. I think it had a tiger lily on it, but now it's been reduced to crumbs in my fist. I didn't even know I was crushing it, but I guess I had to hold on to something while my world veered out of control.  A visit from President Snow. Districts on the verge of uprisings. A direct death threat to Gale, with others to follow. Everyone I love doomed. And who knows who else will pay for my actions? Unless I turn things around on this tour. Quiet the discontent and put the president's mind at rest. And how? By proving to the country beyond any shadow of a doubt that I love Peeta Mellark.  
  
  I can't do it, I think. I'm not that good. Peeta's the good one, the likable one. He can make people believe anything. I'm the one who shuts up and sits back and lets him do as much of the talking as possible. But it isn't Peeta who has to prove his devotion. It's me.  
  
  I hear my mother's light, quick tread in the hall. She can't know, I think. Not about any of this. I reach my hands over the tray and quickly brush the bits of cookie from my palm and fingers. I take a shaky sip of my tea.  
  
  “Is everything all right, Katniss?” she asks.  
  
  “It's fine. We never see it on television, but the president always visits the victors before the tour to wish them luck,” I say brightly.  
  
  My mother's face floods with relief. “Oh. I thought there was some kind of trouble.”  
  
  “No, not at all,” I say. “The trouble will start when my prep team sees how I've let my eyebrows grow back in.” My mother laughs, and I think about how there was no going back after I took over car  
ing for the family when I was eleven. How I will always have to protect her.  
  
  “Why don't I start your bath?” she asks.  
  
  “Great,” I say, and I can see how pleased she is by my response.  
  
  Since I've been home I've been trying hard to mend my relationship with my mother. Asking her to do things for me instead of brushing aside any offer of help, as I did for years out of anger. Letting her handle all the money I won. Returning her hugs instead of tolerating them. My time in the arena made me realize how I needed to stop punishing her for something she couldn't help, specifically the crushing depression she fell into after my father's death. Because sometimes things happen to people and they're not equipped to deal with them.  
  
  Like me, for instance. Right now.  
  
  Besides, there's one wonderful thing she did when I arrived back in the district. After our families and friends had greeted Peeta and me at the train station, there were a few questions allowed from reporters. Someone asked my mother what she thought of my new boyfriend, and she replied that, while Peeta was the very model of what a young man should be, I wasn't old enough to have any boyfriend at all. She followed this with a pointed look at Peeta. There was a lot of laughter and comments like “Somebody's in trouble” from the press, and Peeta dropped my hand and sidestepped away from me. That didn't last long—there was too much pressure to act otherwise—but it gave us an excuse to be a little more reserved than we'd been in the Capitol. And maybe it can help account for how little I've been seen in Peeta's company since the cameras left.  
  
  I go upstairs to the bathroom, where a steaming tub awaits. My mother has added a small bag of dried flowers that perfumes the air. None of us are used to the luxury of turning on a tap and having a limitless supply of hot water at our fingertips. We had only cold at our home in the Seam, and a bath meant boiling the rest over the fire. I undress and lower myself into the silky water—my mother has poured in some kind of oil as well — and try to get a grip on things.  
  
  The first question is who to tell, if anyone. Not my mother or Prim, obviously; they'd only become sick with worry. Not Gale. Even if I could get word to him. What would he do with the information, anyway? If he were alone, I might try to persuade him to run away. Certainly he could survive in the woods. But he's not alone and he'd never leave his family. Or me. When I get home I'll have to tell him something about why our Sundays are a thing of the past, but I can't think about that now. Only about my next move. Besides, Gale's already so angry and frustrated with the Capitol that I sometimes think he's going to arrange his own uprising. The last thing he needs is an incentive. No, I can't tell anyone I'm leaving behind in District 12.  
  
  There are still three people I might confide in, starting with Cinna, my stylist. But my guess is Cinna might already be at risk, and I don't want to pull him into any more trouble by closer association with me. Then there's Peeta, who will be my partner in this deception, but how do I begin that conversation? Hey, Peeta, remember how I told you I was kind of faking being in love with you? Well, I really need you to forget about that now and act extra in love with me or the president might kill Gale. I can't do it. Besides, Peeta will perform well whether he knows what's at stake or not. That leaves Haymitch. Drunken, cranky, confrontational Haymitch, who I just poured a basin of ice water on. As my mentor in the Games it was his duty to keep me alive. I only hope he's still up for the job.  
  
  I slide down into the water, letting it block out the sounds around me. I wish the tub would expand so I could go swimming, like I used to on hot summer Sundays in the woods with my father. Those days were a special treat. We would leave early in the morning and hike farther into the woods than usual to a small lake he'd found while hunting. I don't even remember learning to swim, I was so young when he taught me. I just remember diving, turning somersaults, and paddling around. The muddy bottom of the lake beneath my toes. The smell of blossoms and greenery. Floating on my back, as I am now, staring at the blue sky while the chatter of the woods was muted by the water. He'd bag the waterfowl that nested around the shore, I'd hunt for eggs in the grasses, and we'd both dig for katniss roots, the plant for which he named me, in the shallows. At night, when we got home, my mother would pretend not to recognize me because I was so clean. Then she'd cook up an amazing dinner of roasted duck and baked katniss tubers with gravy.  
  
  I never took Gale to the lake. I could have. It's time-consuming to get there, but the waterfowl are such easy pickings you can make up for lost hunting time. It's a place I've never really wanted to share with anyone, though, a place that belonged only to my father and me. Since the Games, when I've had little to occupy my days, I've gone there a couple of times. The swimming was still nice, but mostly the visits depressed me. Over the course of the last five years, the lake's remarkably unchanged and I'm almost unrecognizable.  
  
  Even underwater I can hear the sounds of commotion. Honking car horns, shouts of greeting, doors banging shut. It can only mean my entourage has arrived. I just have time to towel off and slip into a robe before my prep team bursts into the bathroom. There's no question of privacy. When it comes to my body, we have no secrets, these three people and me.  
  
  “Katniss, your eyebrows!” Venia shrieks right off, and even with the black cloud hanging over me, I have to stifle a laugh. Her aqua hair has been styled so it sticks out in sharp points all over her head, and the gold tattoos that used to be confined above her brows have curled around under her eyes, all contributing to the impression that I've literally shocked her.  
  
  Octavia comes up and pats Venia's back soothingly, her curvy body looking plumper than usual next to Venia's thin, angular one. “There, there. You can fix those in no time. But what am I going to do with these nails?” She grabs my hand and pins it flat between her two pea green ones. No, her skin isn't exactly pea green now. It's more of a light evergreen. The shift in shade is no doubt an attempt to stay abreast of the capricious fashion trends of the Capitol. “Really, Katniss, you could have left me something to work with!” she wails.  
  
  It's true. I've bitten my nails to stubs in the past couple of months. I thought about trying to break the habit but couldn't think of a good reason I should. “Sorry,” I mutter. I hadn't really been spending much time worrying about how it might affect my prep team.  
  
  Flavius lifts a few strands of my wet, tangled hair. He gives his head a disapproving shake, causing his orange corkscrew curls to bounce around. “Has anyone touched this since you last saw us?” he asks sternly. “Remember, we specifically asked you to leave your hair alone.”  
  
  “Yes!” I say, grateful that I can show I haven't totally taken them for granted. “I mean, no, no one's cut it. I did remember that.” No, I didn't. It's more like the issue never came up. Since I've been home, all I've done is stick it in its usual old braid down my back.  
  
  This seems to mollify them, and they all kiss me, set me on a chair in my bedroom, and, as usual, start talking nonstop without bothering to notice if I'm listening. While Venia reinvents my eyebrows and Octavia gives me fake nails and Flavius massages goo into my hair, I hear all about the Capitol. What a hit the Games were, how dull things have been since, how no one can wait until Peeta and I visit again at the end of the Victory Tour. After that, it won't be long before the Capitol begins gearing up for the Quarter Quell.  
  
  “Isn't it thrilling?”  
  
  “Don't you feel so lucky?”  
  
  “In your very first year of being a victor, you get to be a mentor in a Quarter Quell!”  
  
  Their words overlap in a blur of excitement.  
  
  “Oh, yes,” I say neutrally. It's the best I can do. In a normal year, being a mentor to the tributes is the stuff of nightmares. I can't walk by the school now without wondering what kid I'll have to coach. But to make things even worse,  this is the year of the Seventy-fifth Hunger Games, and that means it's also a Quarter Quell. They occur every twenty-five years, marking the anniversary of the districts' defeat with over-the-top celebrations and, for extra fun, some miserable twist for the tributes. I've never been alive for one, of course. But in school I remember hearing that for the second Quarter Quell, the Capitol demanded that twice the number of tributes be provided for the arena. The teachers didn't go into much more detail, which is surprising, because that was the year District 12's very own Haymitch Abernathy won the crown.  
  
  “Haymitch better be preparing himself for a lot of attention!” squeals Octavia.  
  
  Haymitch has never mentioned his personal experience in the arena to me. I would never ask. And if I ever saw his Games televised in reruns, I must've been too young to remember it. But the Capitol won't let him forget it this year. In a way, it's a good thing Peeta and I will both be available as mentors during the Quell, because it's a sure bet that Haymitch will be wasted.  
  
  After they've exhausted the topic of the Quarter Quell, my prep team, launches into a whole lot of stuff about their incomprehensibly silly lives. Who said what about someone I've never heard of and what sort of shoes they just bought and a long story from Octavia about what a mistake it was to have everyone wear feathers to her birthday party.  
  
  Soon my brows are stinging, my hair's smooth and silky, and my nails are ready to be painted. Apparently they've been given instruction to prepare only my hands and face, probably because everything else will be covered in the cold weather. Flavius badly wants to use his own trademark purple lipstick on me but resigns himself to a pink as they begin to color my face and nails. I can see by the palette Cinna has assigned that we're going for girlish, not sexy.  
  
  Good. I'll never convince anyone of anything if I'm trying to be provocative. Haymitch made that very clear when he was coaching me for my interview for the Games.  
  
  My mother comes in, somewhat shyly, and says that Cinna has asked her to show the preps how she did my hair the day of the reaping. They respond with enthusiasm and then watch, thoroughly engrossed, as she breaks down the process of the elaborate braided hairdo. In the mirror, I can see their earnest faces following her every move, their eagerness when it is their turn to try a step. In fact, all three are so readily respectful and nice to my mother that I feel bad about how I go around feeling so superior to them. Who knows who I would be or what I would talk about if I'd been raised in the Capitol? Maybe my biggest regret would be having feathered costumes at my birthday party, too.  
  
  When my hair is done, I find Cinna downstairs in the living room, and just the sight of him makes me feel more hopeful. He looks the same as always, simple clothes, short brown hair, just a hint of gold eyeliner. We embrace, and I can barely keep from spilling out the entire episode with President Snow. But no, I've decided to tell Haymitch first. He'll know best who to burden with it. It's so easy to talk to Cinna, though. Lately we've been speaking a lot on the telephone that came with the house. It's sort of a joke, because almost no one else we know owns one. There's Peeta, but obviously I don't call him. Haymitch tore his out of the wall years ago. My friend Madge, the mayor's daughter, has a telephone in her house, but if we want to talk, we do it in person. At first, the thing barely ever got used. Then Cinna started to call to work on my talent.  
  
  Every victor is supposed to have one. Your talent is the activity you take up since you don't have to work either in school or your district's industry. It can be anything, really, anything that they can interview you about. Peeta, it turns out, actually has a talent, which is painting. He's been frosting those cakes and cookies for years in his family's bakery. But now that he's rich, he can afford to smear real paint on canvases. I don't have a talent, unless you count hunting illegally, which they don't. Or maybe singing, which I wouldn't do for the Capitol in a million years. My mother tried to interest me in a variety of suitable alternatives from a list Effie Trinket sent her. Cooking, flower arranging, playing the flute. None of them took, although Prim had a knack for all three. Finally Cinna stepped in and offered to help me develop my passion for designing clothes, which really required development since it was nonexistent. But I said yes because it meant getting to talk to Cinna, and he promised he'd do all the work.  
  
  Now he's arranging things around my living room: clothing, fabrics, and sketchbooks with designs he's drawn. I pick up one of the sketchbooks and examine a dress I supposedly created. “You know, I think I show a lot of promise,” I say.  
  
  “Get dressed, you worthless thing,” he says, tossing a bundle of clothes at me.  
  
  I may have no interest in designing clothes but I do love the ones Cinna makes for me. Like these. Flowing black pants made of a thick, warm material. A comfortable white shirt. A sweater woven from green and blue and gray strands of kitten-soft wool. Laced leather boots that don't pinch my toes.  
  
  “Did I design my outfit?” I ask.  
  
  “No, you aspire to design your outfit and be like me, your fashion hero,” says Cinna. He hands me a small stack of cards. “You'll read these off camera while they're filming the clothes. Try to sound like you care.”  
  
  Just then, Effie Trinket arrives in a pumpkin orange wig to remind everyone, “We're on a schedule!” She kisses me on both cheeks while waving in the camera crew, then orders me into position. Effie's the only reason we got anywhere on time in the Capitol, so I try to accommodate her. I start bobbing around like a puppet, holding up outfits and saying meaningless things like “Don't you love it?” The sound team records me reading from my cards in a chirpy voice so they can insert it later, then I'm tossed out of the room so they can film my/Cinna's designs in peace.  
  
  Prim got out early from school for the event. Now she stands in the kitchen, being interviewed by another crew. She looks lovely in a sky blue frock that brings out her eyes, her blond hair pulled back in a matching ribbon. She's leaning a bit forward on the toes of her shiny white boots like she's about to take flight, like—  
  
  Bam! It's like someone actually hits me in the chest. No one has, of course, but the pain is so real I take a step back. I squeeze my eyes shut and I don't see Prim—I see Rue, the twelve-year-old girl from District 11 who was my ally in the arena. She could fly, birdlike, from tree to tree, catching on to the slenderest branches. Rue, who I didn't save. Who I let die. I picture her lying on the ground with the spear still wedged in her stomach... .  
  
  Who else will I fail to save from the Capitol's vengeance? Who else will be dead if I don't satisfy President Snow?  
  
  I realize Cinna's trying to put a coat on me, so I raise my arms. I feel fur, inside and out, encasing me. It's from no animal I've ever seen. “Ermine,” he tells me as I stroke the white sleeve. Leather gloves. A bright red scarf. Something furry covers my ears. “You're bringing earmuffs back in style.”  
  
  I hate earmuffs, I think. They make it hard to hear, and since I was blasted deaf in one ear in the arena, I dislike them even more. After I won, the Capitol repaired my ear, but I still find myself testing it.  
  
  My mother hurries up with something cupped in her hand. “For good luck,” she says.  
  
  It's the pin Madge gave me before I left for the Games. A mockingjay flying in a circle of gold. I tried to give it to Rue but she wouldn't take it. She said the pin was the reason she'd decided to trust me. Cinna fixes it on the knot in the scarf.  
  
  Effie Trinket's nearby, clapping her hands. “Attention, everyone! We're about to do the first outdoor shot, where the victors greet each other at the beginning of their marvelous trip. All right, Katniss, big smile, you're very excited, right?” I don't exaggerate when I say she shoves me out the door.  
  
  For a moment I can't quite see right because of the snow, which is now coming down in earnest. Then I make out Peeta coming through his front door. In my head I hear President Snow's directive, “Convince me.” And I know I must.  
  
  My face breaks into a huge smile and I start walking in Peeta's direction. Then, as if I can't stand it anoth  
er second, I start running. He catches me and spins me around and then he slips — he still isn't entirely in command of his artificial leg—and we fall into the snow, me on top of him, and that's where we have our first kiss in months. It's full of fur and snowflakes and lipstick, but underneath all that, I can feel the steadiness that Peeta brings to everything. And I know I'm not alone. As badly as I have hurt him, he won't expose me in front of the cameras. Won't condemn me with a halfhearted kiss. He's still looking out for me. Just as he did in the arena. Somehow the thought makes me want to cry. Instead I pull him to his feet, tuck my glove through the crook of his arm, and merrily pull him on our way.  
  
  The rest of the day is a blur of getting to the station, bidding everyone good-bye, the train pulling out, the old team — Peeta and me, Effie and Haymitch, Cinna and Portia, Peeta's stylist—dining on an indescribably delicious meal I don't remember. And then I'm swathed in pajamas and a voluminous robe, sitting in my plush compartment, waiting for the others to go to sleep. I know Haymitch will be up for hours. He doesn't like to sleep when it's dark out.  
  
  When the train seems quiet, I put on my slippers and pad down to his door. I have to knock several times before he answers, scowling, as if he's certain I've brought bad news.  
  
  “What do you want?” he says, nearly knocking me out with a cloud of wine fumes.  
  
  “I have to talk to you,” I whisper.  
  
  “Now?” he says. I nod. “This better be good.” He waits, but I feel certain every word we utter on a Capitol train is being recorded. “Well?” he barks.  
  
  The train starts to brake and for a second I think President Snow is watching me and doesn't approve of my confiding in Haymitch and has decided to go ahead and kill me now. But we're just stopping for fuel.  
  
  “The train's so stuffy,” I say.  
  
  It's a harmless phrase, but I see Haymitch's eyes narrow in understanding. “I know what you need.” He pushes past me and lurches down the hall to a door. When he wrestles it open, a blast of snow hits us. He trips out onto the ground.  
  
  A Capitol attendant rushes to help, but Haymitch waves her away good-naturedly as he staggers off. “Just want some fresh air. Only be a minute.”  
  
  “Sorry. He's drunk,” I say apologetically. “I'll get him.” I hop down and stumble along the track behind him, soaking my slippers with snow, as he leads me beyond the end of the train so we will not be overheard. Then he turns on me.  
  
  “What?”  
  
  I tell him everything. About the president's visit, about Gale, about how we're all going to die if I fail.  
  
  His face sobers, grows older in the glow of the red tail-lights. “Then you can't fail.”  
  
  “If you could just help me get through this trip—” I begin.  
  
  “No, Katniss, it's not just this trip,” he says. “What do you mean?” I say.  
  
  “Even if you pull it off, they'll be back in another few months to take us all to the Games. You and Peeta, you'll be mentors now, every year from here on out. And every year they'll revisit the romance and broadcast the details of your private life, and you'll never, ever be able to do anything but live happily ever after with that boy.”  
  
  The full impact of what he's saying hits me. I will never have a life with Gale, even if I want to. I will never be allowed to live alone. I will have to be forever in love with Peeta. The Capitol will insist on it. I'll have a few years maybe, because I'm still only sixteen, to stay with my mother and Prim. And then ... and then ...  
  
  “Do you understand what I mean?” he presses me.  
  
  I nod. He means there's only one future, if I want to keep those I love alive and stay alive myself. I'll have to marry Peeta.  
  
  We slog back to the train in silence. In the hallway outside my door, Haymitch gives my shoulder a pat and says, “You could do a lot worse, you know.” He heads off to his compartment, taking the smell of wine with him.  
  
  In my room, I remove my sodden slippers, my wet robe and pajamas. There are more in the drawers but I just crawl between the covers of my bed in my underclothes. I stare into the darkness, thinking about my conversation with Haymitch. Everything he said was true about the Capitol's expectations, my future with Peeta, even his last comment. Of course, I could do a lot worse than Peeta. That isn't really the point, though, is it? One of the few freedoms we have in District 12 is the right to marry who we want or not marry at all. And now even that has been taken away from me. I wonder if President Snow will insist we have children. If we do, they'll have to face the reaping each year. And wouldn't it be something to see the child of not one but two victors chosen for the arena? Victors' children have been in the ring before. It always causes a lot of excitement and generates talk about how the odds are not in that family's favor. But it happens too frequently to just be about odds. Gale's convinced the Capitol does it on purpose, rigs the drawings to add extra drama. Given all the trouble I've caused, I've probably guaranteed any child of mine a spot in the Games.  
  
  I think of Haymitch, unmarried, no family, blotting out the world with drink. He could have had his choice of any woman in the district. And he chose solitude. Not solitude— that sounds too peaceful. More like solitary confinement. Was it because, having been in the arena, he knew it was better than risking the alternative? I had a taste of that alternative when they called Prim's name on reaping day and I watched her walk to the stage to her death. But as her sister I could take her place, an option forbidden to our mother.  
  
  My mind searches frantically for a way out. I can't let President Snow condemn me to this. Even if it means taking my own life. Before that, though, I'd try to run away. What would they do if I simply vanished? Disappeared into the woods and never came out? Could I even manage to take everyone I love with me, start a new life deep in the wild? Highly unlikely but not impossible.  
  
  I shake my head to clear it. This is not the time to be making wild escape plans. I must focus on the Victory Tour. Too many people's fates depend on my giving a good show.  
  
  Dawn comes before sleep does, and there's Effie rapping on my door. I pull on whatever clothes are at the top of the drawer and drag myself down to the dining car. I don't see what difference it makes when I get up, since this is a travel day, but then it turns out that yesterday's makeover was just to get me to the train station. Today I'll get the works from my prep team.  
  
  “Why? It's too cold for anything to show,” I grumble.  
  
  “Not in District Eleven,” says Effie.  
  
  District 11. Our first stop. I'd rather start in any other district, since this was Rue's home. But that's not how the Victory Tour works. Usually it kicks off in 12 and then goes in descending district order to 1, followed by the Capitol. The victor's district is skipped and saved for very last. Since 12 puts on the least fabulous celebration — usually just a dinner for the tributes and a victory rally in the square, where nobody looks like they're having any fun — it's probably best to get us out of the way as soon as possible. This year, for the first time since Haymitch won, the final stop on the tour will be 12, and the Capitol will spring for the festivities.  
  
  I try to enjoy the food like Hazelle said. The kitchen staff clearly wants to please me. They've prepared my favorite, lamb stew with dried plums, among other delicacies. Orange juice and a pot of steaming hot chocolate wait at my place at the table. So I eat a lot, and the meal is beyond reproach, but I can't say I'm enjoying it. I'm also annoyed that no one but Effie and I has shown up.  
  
  “Where's everybody else?” I ask.  
  
  “Oh, who knows where Haymitch is,” says Effie. I didn't really expect Haymitch, because he's probably just getting to bed. “Cinna was up late working on organizing your garment car. He must have over a hundred outfits for you. Your evening clothes are exquisite. And Peeta's team is probably still asleep.”  
  
  “Doesn't he need prepping?” I ask.  
  
  “Not the way you do,” Effie replies.  
  
  What does this mean? It means I get to spend the morning having the hair ripped off my body while Peeta sleeps in. I hadn't thought about i  
t much, but in the arena at least some of the boys got to keep their body hair whereas none of the girls did. I can remember Peeta's now, as I bathed him by the stream. Very blond in the sunlight, once the mud and blood had been washed away. Only his face remained completely smooth. Not one of the boys grew a beard, and many were old enough to. I wonder what they did to them.  
  
  If I feel ragged, my prep team seems in worse condition, knocking back coffee and sharing brightly colored little pills. As far as I can tell, they never get up before noon unless there's some sort of national emergency, like my leg hair. I was so happy when it grew back in, too. As if it were a sign that things might be returning to normal. I run my fingers along the soft, curly down on my legs and give myself over to the team. None of them are up to their usual chatter, so I can hear every strand being yanked from its follicle. I have to soak in a tub full of a thick, unpleasant-smelling solution, while my face and hair are plastered with creams. Two more baths follow in other, less offensive, concoctions. I'm plucked and scoured and massaged and anointed until I'm raw.  
  
  Flavius tilts up my chin and sighs. “It's a shame Cinna said no alterations on you.”  
  
  “Yes, we could really make you something special,” says Octavia.  
  
  “When she's older,” says Venia almost grimly. “Then he'll have to let us.”  
  
  Do what? Blow my lips up like President Snow's? Tattoo my breasts? Dye my skin magenta and implant gems in it? Cut decorative patterns in my face? Give me curved talons? Or cat's whiskers? I saw all these things and more on the people in the Capitol. Do they really have no idea how freakish they look to the rest of us?  
  
  The thought of being left to my prep team's fashion whims only adds to the miseries competing for my attention— my abused body, my lack of sleep, my mandatory marriage, and the terror of being unable to satisfy President Snow's demands. By the time I reach lunch, where Effie, Cinna, Portia, Haymitch, and Peeta have started without me, I'm too weighed down to talk. They're raving about the food and how well they sleep on trains. Everyone's all full of excitement about the tour. Well, everyone but Haymitch. He's nursing a hangover and picking at a muffin. I'm not really hungry, either, maybe because I loaded up on too much rich stuff this morning or maybe because I'm so unhappy. I play around with a bowl of broth, eating only a spoonful or two. I can't even look at Peeta—my designated future husband—although I know none of this is his fault.  
  
  People notice, try to bring me into the conversation, but I just brush them off. At some point, the train stops. Our server reports it will not just be for a fuel stop — some part has malfunctioned and must be replaced. It will require at least an hour. This sends Effie into a state. She pulls out her schedule and begins to work out how the delay will impact every event for the rest of our lives. Finally I just can't stand to listen to her anymore.  
  
  “No one cares, Effie!” I snap. Everyone at the table stares at me, even Haymitch, who you'd think would be on my side in this matter since Effie drives him nuts. I'm immediately put on the defensive. “Well, no one does!” I say, and get up and leave the dining car.  
  
  The train suddenly seems stifling and I'm definitely queasy now. I find the exit door, force it open — triggering some sort of alarm, which I ignore — and jump to the ground, expecting to land in snow. But the air's warm and balmy against my skin. The trees still wear green leaves. How far south have we come in a day? I walk along the track, squinting against the bright sunlight, already regretting my words to Effie. She's hardly to blame for my current predicament. I should go back and apologize. My outburst was the height of bad manners, and manners matter deeply to her. But my feet continue on along the track, past the end of the train, leaving it behind. An hour's delay. I can walk at least twenty minutes in one direction and make it back with plenty of time to spare. Instead, after a couple hundred yards, I sink to the ground and sit there, looking into the distance. If I had a bow and arrows, would I just keep going?  
  
  After a while I hear footsteps behind me. It'll be Haymitch, coming to chew me out. It's not like I don't deserve it, but I still don't want to hear it. “I'm not in the mood for a lecture,” I warn the clump of weeds by my shoes.  
  
  “I'll try to keep it brief.” Peeta takes a seat beside me. “I thought you were Haymitch,” I say.  
  
  “No, he's still working on that muffin.” I watch as Peeta positions his artificial leg. “Bad day, huh?” “It's nothing,” I say.  
  
  He takes a deep breath. “Look, Katniss, I've been wanting to talk to you about the way I acted on the train. I mean, the last train. The one that brought us home. I knew you had something with Gale. I was jealous of him before I even officially met you. And it wasn't fair to hold you to anything that happened in the Games. I'm sorry.”  
  
  His apology takes me by surprise. It's true that Peeta froze me out after I confessed that my love for him during the Games was something of an act. But I don't hold that against him. In the arena, I'd played that romance angle for all it was worth. There had been times when I didn't honestly know how I felt about him. I still don't, really.  
  
  “I'm sorry, too,” I say. I'm not sure for what exactly. Maybe because there's a real chance I'm about to destroy him.  
  
  “There's nothing for you to be sorry about. You were just keeping us alive. But I don't want us to go on like this, ignoring each other in real life and falling into the snow every time there's a camera around. So I thought if I stopped being so, you know, wounded, we could take a shot at just being friends,” he says.  
  
  All my friends are probably going to end up dead, but refusing Peeta wouldn't keep him safe. “Okay,” I say. His offer does make me feel better. Less duplicitous somehow. It would be nice if he'd come to me with this earlier, before I knew that President Snow had other plans and just being friends was not an option for us anymore. But either way, I'm glad we're speaking again.  
  
  “So what's wrong?” he asks.  
  
  I can't tell him. I pick at the clump of weeds.  
  
  “Let's start with something more basic. Isn't it strange that I know you'd risk your life to save mine ... but I don't know what your favorite color is?” he says.  
  
  A smile creeps onto my lips. “Green. What's yours?”  
  
  “Orange,” he says.  
  
  “Orange? Like Effie's hair?” I say.  
  
  “A bit more muted,” he says. “More like ... sunset.”  
  
  Sunset. I can see it immediately, the rim of the descending sun, the sky streaked with soft shades of orange. Beautiful. I remember the tiger lily cookie and, now that Peeta is talking to me again, it's all I can do not to recount the whole story about President Snow. But I know Haymitch wouldn't want me to. I'd better stick to small talk.  
  
  “You know, everyone's always raving about your paintings. I feel bad I haven't seen them,” I say.  
  
  “Well, I've got a whole train car full.” He rises and offers me his hand. “Come on.”  
  
  It's good to feel his fingers entwined with mine again, not for show but in actual friendship. We walk back to the train hand in hand. At the door, I remember. “I've got to apologize to Effie first.”  
  
  “Don't be afraid to lay it on thick,” Peeta tells me.  
  
  So when we go back to the dining car, where the others are still at lunch, I give Effie an apology that I think is overkill but in her mind probably just manages to compensate for my breach of etiquette. To her credit, Effie accepts graciously. She says it's clear I'm under a lot of pressure. And her comments about the necessity of someone attending to the schedule only last about five minutes. Really, I've gotten off easily.  
  
  When Effie finishes, Peeta leads me down a few cars to see his paintings. I don't know what I expected. Larger versions of the flower cookies maybe. But this is something entirely different. Peeta has painted the Games.  
  
  Some you wouldn't get right away, if you hadn't been with him in the arena yourself. Water dripping through the cracks in our cave. The dry pond bed. A pair of hands, his own, digging for roots. Others any viewer would recognize. The golden horn called the Cornucopia. Clove  
arranging the knives inside her jacket. One of the mutts, unmistakably the blond, green-eyed one meant to be Glimmer, snarling as it makes its way toward us. And me. I am everywhere. High up in a

 tree. Beating a shirt against the stones in the stream. Lying unconscious in a pool of blood. And one I can't place — perhaps this is how I looked when his fever was high—emerging from a silver gray mist that matches my eyes exactly.  
  
  “What do you think?” he asks.

The designated driver came to the restaurant without a thermo bag (a bag which is provided by the delivery companies to be able to help carry multiple bags and keep them nice temperature), he showed up holding a coffee drink (his personal drink) and no bag. I explained to him that a thermo bag was necessary since were 4 takeout bags and that he wouldn’t be able to carry all 4 plus his own coffee without compromising the integrity of the order, so I asked if he could go grab his thermo bag and drop off in his drink at his car so all hands could be used.

He refused and said he was parked far from the restaurant and didn’t want to do 2 trips and tried to convince me that we was able to carry all 4 bags (let me just say the bags have no handles, looks like a big version of the paper bags that kids use to take lunch sandwiches to school), I once again explained the situation and mentioned that is actually policy of the company to have the driver to bring their thermo bags.

He started to raise his voice and started to threaten saying that he was not going to do the delivery right if he went bag to his car and saying I was an ahole, I replied saying that I was dismissing his job and that I didn’t need a driver like him to delivery our food and proceeded to walk away from him to call the company to request a new driver, he started to call for me and saying that I was nobody that I couldn’t make that decision (ps: my boss was watching everything and gave me the tablet to make the report on the driver), after everything he just left and I made a big report about him.

I told this story to few of my coworkers and some friends and I was surprised that some said I was an Ahole, some said that the report could cost the guy’s job that I should’ve just requested a new driver without explanation, some said I should’ve just gave him all the bag and let him carry all to his parked and let him deal with the consequences if he dropped the order, some said that I could’ve offer to help him to carry to his car… this last one I think was a really ridiculous reasoning since I don’t work for the delivery company I work for the restaurant my job is INSIDE the restaurant.",9,1749360516.0,AmItheAsshole,13,0.91,False

 I clasp the flask between my hands even though the warmth from the tea has long since leached into the frozen air. My muscles are clenched tight against the cold. If a pack of wild dogs were to appear at this moment, the odds of scaling a tree before they attacked are not in my favor. I should get up, move around, and work the stiffness from my limbs. But instead I sit, as motionless as the rock beneath me, while the dawn begins to lighten the woods. I can't fight the sun. I can only watch helplessly as it drags me into a day that I've been dreading for months. By noon they will all be at my new house in the Victor's Village. The reporters, the camera crews, even Effie Trinket, my old escort, will have made their way to District 12 from the Capitol. I wonder if Effie will still be wearing that silly pink wig, or if she'll be sporting some other unnatural color especially for the Victory Tour. There will be others waiting, too. A staff to cater to my every need on the long train trip. A prep team to beautify me for public appearances. My stylist and friend, Cinna, who designed the gorgeous outfits that first made the audience take notice of me in the Hunger Games. If it were up to me, I would try to forget the Hunger Games entirely. Never speak of them. Pretend they were nothing but a bad dream. But the Victory Tour makes that impossible. Strategically placed almost midway between the annual Games, it is the Capitol's way of keeping the horror fresh and immediate. Not only are we in the districts forced to remember the iron grip of the Capitol's power each year, we are forced to celebrate it. And this year, I am one of the stars of the show. I will have to travel from district to district, to stand before the cheering crowds who secretly loathe me, to look down into the faces of the families whose children I have killed...  
  
  The sun persists in rising, so I make myself stand. All my joints complain and my left leg has been asleep for so long that it takes several minutes of pacing to bring the feeling back into it. I've been in the woods three hours, but as I've made no real attempt at hunting, I have nothing to show for it. It doesn't matter for my mother and little sister, Prim, anymore. They can afford to buy butcher meat in town, although none of us likes it any better than fresh game. But my best friend, Gale Hawthorne, and his family will be depending on today's haul and I can't let them down. I start the hour-and-a-half trek it will take to cover our snare line. Back when we were in school, we had time in the afternoons to check the line and hunt and gather and still get back to trade in town. But now that Gale has gone to work in the coal mines — and I have nothing to do all day—I've taken over the job.  
  
  By this time Gale will have clocked in at the mines, taken the stomach-churning elevator ride into the depths of the earth, and be pounding away at a coal seam. I know what it's like down there. Every year in school, as part of our training, my class had to tour the mines. When I was little, it was just unpleasant. The claustrophobic tunnels, foul air, suffocating darkness on all sides. But after my father and several other miners were killed in an explosion, I could barely force myself onto the elevator. The annual trip became an enormous source of anxiety. Twice I made myself so sick in anticipation of it that my mother kept me home because she thought I had contracted the flu.  
  
  I think of Gale, who is only really alive in the woods, with its fresh air and sunlight and clean, flowing water. I don't know how he stands it. Well ... yes, I do. He stands it because it's the way to feed his mother and two younger brothers and sister. And here I am with buckets of money, far more than enough to feed both our families now, and he won't take a single coin. It's even hard for him to let me bring in meat, although he'd surely have kept my mother and Prim supplied if I'd been killed in the Games. I tell him he's doing me a favor, that it drives me nuts to sit around all day. Even so, I never drop off the game while he's at home. Which is easy since he works twelve hours a day.  
  
  The only time I really get to see Gale now is on Sundays, when we meet up in the woods to hunt together. It's still the best day of the week, but it's not like it used to be before, when we could tell each other anything. The Games have spoiled even that. I keep hoping that as time passes we'll regain the ease between us, but part of me knows it's futile. There's no going back.  
  
  I get a good haul from the traps — eight rabbits, two squirrels, and a beaver that swam into a wire contraption Gale designed himself. He's something of a whiz with snares, rigging them to bent saplings so they pull the kill out of the reach of predators, balancing logs on delicate stick triggers, weaving inescapable baskets to capture fish. As I go along, carefully resetting each snare, I know I can never quite replicate his eye for balance, his instinct for where the prey will cross the path. It's more than experience. It's a natural gift. Like the way I can shoot at an animal in almost complete darkness and still take it down with one arrow.  
  
  By the time I make it back to the fence that surrounds District 12, the sun is well up. As always, I listen a moment, but there's no telltale hum of electrical current running through the chain link. There hardly ever is, even though the thing is supposed to be charged full-time. I wriggle through the opening at the bottom of the fence and come up in the Meadow, just a stone's throw from my home. My old home. We still get to keep it since officially it's the designated dwelling of my mother and sister. If I should drop dead right now, they would have to return to it. But at present, they're both happily installed in the new house in the Victor's Village, and I'm the only one who uses the squat little place where I was raised. To me, it's my real home.  
  
  I go there now to switch my clothes. Exchange my father's old leather jacket for a fine wool coat that always seems too tight in the shoulders. Leave my soft, worn hunting boots for a pair of expensive machine-made shoes that my mother thinks are more appropriate for someone of my status. I've already stowed my bow and arrows in a hollow log in the woods. Although time is ticking away, I allow myself a few minutes to sit in the kitchen. It has an abandoned quality with no fire on the hearth, no cloth on the table. I mourn my old life here. We barely scraped by, but I knew where I fit in, I knew what my place was in the tightly interwoven fabric that was our life. I wish I could go back to it because, in retrospect, it seems so secure compared with now, when I am so rich and so famous and so hated by the authorities in the Capitol.  
  
  A wailing at the back door demands my attention. I open it to find Buttercup, Prim's scruffy old tomcat. He dislikes the new house almost as much as I do and always leaves it when my sister's at school. We've never been particularly fond of each other, but now we have this new bond. I let him in, feed him a chunk of beaver fat, and even rub him between the ears for a bit. “You're hideous, you know that, right?” I ask him. Buttercup nudges my hand for more petting, but we have to go. “Come on, you.” I scoop him up with one hand, grab my game bag with the other, and haul them both out onto the street. The cat springs free and disappears under a bush.  
  
  The shoes pinch my toes as I crunch along the cinder street. Cutting down alleys and through backyards gets me to Gale's house in minutes. His mother, Hazelle, sees me through the window, where she's bent over the kitchen sink. She dries her hands on her apron and disappears to meet me at the door.  
  
  I like Hazelle. Respect her. The explosion that killed my father took out her husband as well, leaving her with three boys and a baby due any day. Less than a week after she gave birth, she was out hunting the streets for work. The mines weren't an option, what with a baby to look after, but she managed to get laundry from some of the merchants in town. At fourteen, Gale, the eldest of the kids, became the main supporter of the family. He was already signed up for tesserae, which entitled them to a meager supply of grain and oil in exchange for his entering h  
is name extra times in the drawing to become a tribute. On top of that, even back then, he was a skilled trapper. But it wasn't enough to keep a family of five without Hazelle working her fingers to the bone on that washboard. In winter her hands got so red and cracked, they bled at the slightest provocation. Still would if it wasn't for a salve my mother concocted. But they are determined, Hazelle and Gale, that the other boys, twelve-year-old Rory and ten-year-old Vick, and the baby, four-year-old Posy, will never have to sign up for tesserae.  
  
  Hazelle smiles when she sees the game. She takes the beaver by the tail, feeling its weight. “He's going to make a nice stew.” Unlike Gale, she has no problem with our hunting arrangement.  
  
  “Good pelt, too,” I answer. It's comforting here with Hazelle. Weighing the merits of the game, just as we always have. She pours me a mug of herb tea, which I wrap my chilled fingers around gratefully. “You know, when I get back from the tour, I was thinking I might take Rory out with me sometimes. After school. Teach him to shoot.”  
  
  Hazelle nods. “That'd be good. Gale means to, but he's only got his Sundays, and I think he likes saving those for you.”  
  
  I can't stop the redness that floods my cheeks. It's stupid, of course. Hardly anybody knows me better than Hazelle. Knows the bond I share with Gale. I'm sure plenty of people assumed that we'd eventually get married even if I never gave it any thought. But that was before the Games. Before my fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, announced he was madly in love with me. Our romance became a key strategy for our survival in the arena. Only it wasn't just a strategy for Peeta. I'm not sure what it was for me. But I know now it was nothing but painful for Gale. My chest tightens as I think about how, on the Victory Tour, Peeta and I will have to present ourselves as lovers again.  
  
  I gulp my tea even though it's too hot and push back from the table. “I better get going. Make myself presentable for the cameras.”  
  
  Hazelle hugs me. “Enjoy the food.”  
  
  “Absolutely,” I say.  
  
  My next stop is the Hob, where I've traditionally done the bulk of my trading. Years ago it was a warehouse to store coal, but when it fell into disuse, it became a meeting place for illegal trades and then blossomed into a full-time black market. If it attracts a somewhat criminal element, then I belong here, I guess. Hunting in the woods surrounding District 12 violates at least a dozen laws and is punishable by death.  
  
  Although they never mention it, I owe the people who frequent the Hob. Gale told me that Greasy Sae, the old woman who serves up soup, started a collection to sponsor Peeta and me during the Games. It was supposed to be just a Hob thing, but a lot of other people heard about it and chipped in. I don't know exactly how much it was, and the price of any gift in the arena was exorbitant. But for all I know, it made the difference between my life and death.  
  
  It's still odd to drag open the front door with an empty game bag, with nothing to trade, and instead feel the heavy pocket of coins against my hip. I try to hit as many stalls as possible, spreading out my purchases of coffee, buns, eggs, yarn, and oil. As an afterthought, I buy three bottles of white liquor from a one-armed woman named Ripper, a victim of a mine accident who was smart enough to find a way to stay alive.  
  
  The liquor isn't for my family. It's for Haymitch, who acted as mentor for Peeta and me in the Games. He's surly, violent, and drunk most of the time. But he did his job — more than his job—because for the first time in history, two tributes were allowed to win. So no matter who Haymitch is, I owe him, too. And that's for always. I'm getting the white liquor because a few weeks ago he ran out and there was none for sale and he had a withdrawal, shaking and screaming at terrifying things only he could see. He scared Prim to death and, frankly, it wasn't much fun for me to see him like that, either. Ever since then I've been sort of stockpiling the stuff just in case there's a shortage again.  
  
  Cray, our Head Peacekeeper, frowns when he sees me with the bottles. He's an older man with a few strands of silver hair combed sideways above his bright red face. “That stuff's too strong for you, girl.” He should know. Next to Haymitch, Cray drinks more than anyone I've ever met.  
  
  “Aw, my mother uses it in medicines,” I say indifferently.  
  
  “Well, it'd kill just about anything,” he says, and slaps down a coin for a bottle.  
  
  When I reach Greasy Sae's stall, I boost myself up to sit on the counter and order some soup, which looks to be some kind of gourd and bean mixture. A Peacekeeper named Darius comes up and buys a bowl while I'm eating. As law enforcers go, he's one of my favorites. Never really throwing his weight around, usually good for a joke. He's probably in his twenties, but he doesn't seem much older than I do. Something about his smile, his red hair that sticks out every which way, gives him a boyish quality.  
  
  “Aren't you supposed to be on a train?” he asks me.  
  
  “They're collecting me at noon,” I answer.  
  
  “Shouldn't you look better?” he asks in a loud whisper. I can't help smiling at his teasing, in spite of my mood. “Maybe a ribbon in your hair or something?” He flicks my braid with his hand and I brush him away.  
  
  “Don't worry. By the time they get through with me I'll be unrecognizable,” I say.  
  
  “Good,” he says. “Let's show a little district pride for a change, Miss Everdeen. Hm?” He shakes his head at Greasy Sae in mock disapproval and walks off to join his friends.  
  
  “I'll want that bowl back,” Greasy Sae calls after him, but since she's laughing, she doesn't sound particularly stern. “Gale going to see you off?” she asks me.  
  
  “No, he wasn't on the list,” I say. “I saw him Sunday, though.”  
  
  “Think he'd have made the list. Him being your cousin and all,” she says wryly.  
  
  It's just one more part of the lie the Capitol has concocted. When Peeta and I made it into the final eight in the Hunger Games, they sent reporters to do personal stories about us. When they asked about my friends, everyone directed them to Gale. But it wouldn't do, what with the romance I was playing out in the arena, to have my best friend be Gale. He was too handsome, too male, and not the least bit willing to smile and play nice for the cameras. We do resemble each other, though, quite a bit. We have that Seam look. Dark straight hair, olive skin, gray eyes. So some genius made him my cousin. I didn't know about it until we were already home, on the platform at the train station, and my mother said, “Your cousins can hardly wait to see you!” Then I turned and saw Gale and Hazelle and all the kids waiting for me, so what could I do but go along?  
  
  Greasy Sae knows we're not related, but even some of the people who have known us for years seem to have forgotten.  
  
  “I just can't wait for the whole thing to be over,” I whisper.  
  
  “I know,” says Greasy Sae. “But you've got to go through it to get to the end of it. Better not be late.”  
  
  A light snow starts to fall as I make my way to the Victor's Village. It's about a half-mile walk from the square in the center of town, but it seems like another world entirely.  
  
  It's a separate community built around a beautiful green, dotted with flowering bushes. There are twelve houses, each large enough to hold ten of the one I was raised in. Nine stand empty, as they always have. The three in use belong to Haymitch, Peeta, and me.  
  
  The houses inhabited by my family and Peeta give off a warm glow of life. Lit windows, smoke from the chimneys, bunches of brightly colored corn affixed to the front doors as decoration for the upcoming Harvest Festival. However, Haymitch's house, despite the care taken by the grounds-keeper, exudes an air of abandonment and neglect. I brace myself at his front door, knowing it will be foul, then push inside.  
  
  My nose immediately wrinkles in disgust. Haymitch refuses to let anyone in to clean and does a poor job himself. Over the years the odors of liquor and vomit, boiled cabbage and burned meat, unwashed clothes and mouse droppings have intermingled into a stench that brings tears to my eyes. I wade through a litter of discarded wrappings, broken glass, and bones to where I know I will find Haymitch. He sits at the kitchen  
table, his arms sprawled across the wood, his face in a puddle of liquor, snoring his head off.  
  
  I nudge his shoulder. “Get up!” I say loudly, because I've learned there's no subtle way to wake him. His snoring stops for a moment, questioningly, and then resumes. I push him harder. “Get up, Haymitch. It's tour day!” I force the window up, inhaling deep breaths of the clean air outside. My feet shift through the garbage on the floor, and I unearth a tin coffeepot and fill it at the sink. The stove isn't completely out and I manage to coax the few live coals into a flame. I pour some ground coffee into the pot, enough to make sure the resulting brew will be good and strong, and set it on the stove to boil.  
  
  Haymitch is still dead to the world. Since nothing else has worked, I fill a basin with icy cold water, dump it on his head, and spring out of the way. A guttural animal sound comes from his throat. He jumps up, kicking his chair ten feet behind him and wielding a knife. I forgot he always sleeps with one clutched in his hand. I should have pried it from his fingers, but I've had a lot on my mind. Spewing profanity, he slashes the air a few moments before coming to his senses. He wipes his face on his shirtsleeve and turns to the windowsill where I perch, just in case I need to make a quick exit.  
  
  “What are you doing?” he sputters.  
  
  “You told me to wake you an hour before the cameras come,” I say.  
  
  “What?” he says.  
  
  “Your idea,” I insist.  
  
  He seems to remember. “Why am I all wet?”  
  
  “I couldn't shake you awake,” I say. “Look, if you wanted to be babied, you should have asked Peeta.”  
  
  “Asked me what?” Just the sound of his voice twists my stomach into a knot of unpleasant emotions like guilt, sadness, and fear. And longing. I might as well admit there's some of that, too. Only it has too much competition to ever win out.  
  
  I watch as Peeta crosses to the table, the sunlight from the window picking up the glint of fresh snow in his blond hair. He looks strong and healthy, so different from the sick, starving boy I knew in the arena, and you can barely even notice his limp now. He sets a loaf of fresh-baked bread on the table and holds out his hand to Haymitch.  
  
  “Asked you to wake me without giving me pneumonia,” says Haymitch, passing over his knife. He pulls off his filthy shirt, revealing an equally soiled undershirt, and rubs himself down with the dry part.  
  
  Peeta smiles and douses Haymitch's knife in white liquor from a bottle on the floor. He wipes the blade clean on his shirttail and slices the bread. Peeta keeps all of us in fresh baked goods. I hunt. He bakes. Haymitch drinks. We have our own ways to stay busy, to keep thoughts of our time as contestants in the Hunger Games at bay. It's not until he's handed Haymitch the heel that he even looks at me for the first time. “Would you like a piece?”  
  
  “No, I ate at the Hob,” I say. “But thank you.” My voice doesn't sound like my own, it's so formal. Just as it's been every time I've spoken to Peeta since the cameras finished filming our happy homecoming and we returned to our real lives.  
  
  “You're welcome,” he says back stiffly.  
  
  Haymitch tosses his shirt somewhere into the mess. “Brrr. You two have got a lot of warming up to do before showtime.”  
  
  He's right, of course. The audience will be expecting the pair of lovebirds who won the Hunger Games. Not two people who can barely look each other in the eye. But all I say is, “Take a bath, Haymitch.” Then I swing out the window, drop to the ground, and head across the green to my house.  
  
  The snow has begun to stick and I leave a trail of footprints behind me. At the front door, I pause to knock the wet stuff from my shoes before I go in. My mother's been working day and night to make everything perfect for the cameras, so it's no time to be tracking up her shiny floors. I've barely stepped inside when she's there, holding my arm as if to stop me.  
  
  “Don't worry, I'm taking them off here,” I say, leaving my shoes on the mat.  
  
  My mother gives an odd, breathy laugh and removes the game bag loaded with supplies from my shoulder. “It's just snow. Did you have a nice walk?”  
  
  “Walk?” She knows I've been in the woods half the night. Then I see the man standing behind her in the kitchen doorway. One look at his tailored suit and surgically perfected features and I know he's from the Capitol. Something is wrong. “It was more like skating. It's really getting slippery out there.”  
  
  “Someone's here to see you,” says my mother. Her face is too pale and I can hear the anxiety she's trying to hide.  
  
  “I thought they weren't due until noon.” I pretend not to notice her state. “Did Cinna come early to help me get ready?”  
  
  “No, Katniss, it's —” my mother begins.  
  
  “This way, please, Miss Everdeen,” says the man. He gestures down the hallway. It's weird to be ushered around your own home, but I know better than to comment on it.  
  
  As I go, I give my mother a reassuring smile over my shoulder. “Probably more instructions for the tour.” They've been sending me all kinds of stuff about my itinerary and what protocol will be observed in each district. But as I walk toward the door of the study, a door I have never even seen closed until this moment, I can feel my mind begin to race. Who is here? What do they want? Why is my mother so pale?  
  
  “Go right in,” says the Capitol man, who has followed me down the hallway.  
  
  I twist the polished brass knob and step inside. My nose registers the conflicting scents of roses and blood. A small, white-haired man who seems vaguely familiar is reading a book. He holds up a finger as if to say, “Give me a moment.” Then he turns and my heart skips a beat.  
  
  I'm staring into the snakelike eyes of President Snow.  
  
  In my mind, President Snow should be viewed in front of marble pillars hung with oversized flags. It's jarring to see him surrounded by the ordinary objects in the room. Like taking the lid off a pot and finding a fanged viper instead of stew.  
  
  What could he be doing here? My mind rushes back to the opening days of other Victory Tours. I remember seeing the winning tributes with their mentors and stylists. Even some high government officials have made appearances occasionally. But I have never seen President Snow. He attends celebrations in the Capitol. Period.  
  
  If he's made the journey all the way from his city, it can only mean one thing. I'm in serious trouble. And if I am, so is my family. A shiver goes through me when I think of the proximity of my mother and sister to this man who despises me. Will always despise me. Because I outsmarted his sadistic Hunger Games, made the Capitol look foolish, and consequently undermined his control.  
  
  All I was doing was trying to keep Peeta and myself alive. Any act of rebellion was purely coincidental. But when the Capitol decrees that only one tribute can live and you have the audacity to challenge it, I guess that's a rebellion in itself. My only defense was pretending that I was driven insane by a passionate love for Peeta. So we were both allowed to live. To be crowned victors. To go home and celebrate and wave good-bye to the cameras and be left alone. Until now.  
  
  Perhaps it is the newness of the house or the shock of seeing him or the mutual understanding that he could have me killed in a second that makes me feel like the intruder. As if this is his home and I'm the uninvited party. So I don't welcome him or offer him a chair. I don't say anything. In fact, I treat him as if he's a real snake, the venomous kind. I stand motionless, my eyes locked on him, considering plans of retreat.  
  
  “I think we'll make this whole situation a lot simpler by agreeing not to lie to each other,” he says. “What do you think?”  
  
  I think my tongue has frozen and speech will be impossible, so I surprise myself by answering back in a steady voice, “Yes, I think that would save time.”  
  
  President Snow smiles and I notice his lips for the first time. I'm expecting snake lips, which is to say none. But his are overly full, the skin stretched too tight. I have to wonder if his mouth has been altered to make him more appealing. If so, it was a waste of time and money, because he's not appealing at all. “My advisors were concerned you woul  
d be difficult, but you're not planning on being difficult, are you?” he asks. “No,” I answer.  
  
  “That's what I told them. I said any girl who goes to such lengths to preserve her life isn't going to be interested in throwing it away with both hands. And then there's her family to think of. Her mother, her sister, and all those ... cousins.” By the way he lingers on the word “cousins,” I can tell he knows that Gale and I don't share a family tree.  
  
  Well, it's all on the table now. Maybe that's better. I don't do well with ambiguous threats. I'd much rather know the score.  
  
  “Let's sit.” President Snow takes a seat at the large desk of polished wood where Prim does her homework and my mother her budgets. Like our home, this is a place that he has no right, but ultimately every right, to occupy. I sit in front of the desk on one of the carved, straight-backed chairs. It's made for someone taller than I am, so only my toes rest on the ground.  
  
  “I have a problem, Miss Everdeen,” says President Snow. “A problem that began the moment you pulled out those poisonous berries in the arena.”  
  
  That was the moment when I guessed that if the Gamemakers had to choose between watching Peeta and me commit suicide—which would mean having no victor— and letting us both live, they would take the latter.  
  
  “If the Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane, had had any brains, he'd have blown you to dust right then. But he had an unfortunate sentimental streak. So here you are. Can you guess where he is?” he asks.  
  
  I nod because, by the way he says it, it's clear that Seneca Crane has been executed. The smell of roses and blood has grown stronger now that only a desk separates us. There's a rose in President Snow's lapel, which at least suggests a source of the flower perfume, but it must be genetically enhanced, because no real rose reeks like that. As for the blood ... I don't know.  
  
  “After that, there was nothing to do but let you play out your little scenario. And you were pretty good, too, with the love-crazed schoolgirl bit. The people in the Capitol were quite convinced. Unfortunately, not everyone in the districts fell for your act,” he says.  
  
  My face must register at least a flicker of bewilderment, because he addresses it.  
  
  “This, of course, you don't know. You have no access to information about the mood in other districts. In several of them, however, people viewed your little trick with the berries as an act of defiance, not an act of love. And if a girl from District Twelve of all places can defy the Capitol and walk away unharmed, what is to stop them from doing the same?” he says. “What is to prevent, say, an uprising?”  
  
  It takes a moment for his last sentence to sink in. Then the full weight of it hits me. “There have been uprisings?” I ask, both chilled and somewhat elated by the possibility.  
  
  “Not yet. But they'll follow if the course of things doesn't change. And uprisings have been known to lead to revolution.” President Snow rubs a spot over his left eyebrow, the very spot where I myself get headaches. “Do you have any idea what that would mean? How many people would die? What conditions those left would have to face? Whatever problems anyone may have with the Capitol, believe me when I say that if it released its grip on the districts for even a short time, the entire system would collapse.”  
  
  I'm taken aback by the directness and even the sincerity of this speech. As if his primary concern is the welfare of the citizens of Panem, when nothing could be further from the truth. I don't know how I dare to say the next words, but I do. “It must be very fragile, if a handful of berries can bring it down.”  
  
  There's a long pause while he examines me. Then he simply says, “It is fragile, but not in the way that you suppose.”  
  
  There's a knock at the door, and the Capitol man sticks his head in. “Her mother wants to know if you want tea.”  
  
  “I would. I would like tea,” says the president. The door opens wider, and there stands my mother, holding a tray with a china tea set she brought to the Seam when she married. “Set it here, please.” He places his book on the corner of the desk and pats the center.  
  
  My mother sets the tray on the desk. It holds a china teapot and cups, cream and sugar, and a plate of cookies. They are beautifully iced with softly colored flowers. The frosting work can only be Peeta's.  
  
  “What a welcome sight. You know, it's funny how often people forget that presidents need to eat, too,” President Snow says charmingly. Well, it seems to relax my mother a bit, anyway.  
  
  “Can I get you anything else? I can cook something more substantial if you're hungry,” she offers.  
  
  “No, this could not be more perfect. Thank you,” he says, clearly dismissing her. My mother nods, shoots me a glance, and goes. President Snow pours tea for both of us and fills his with cream and sugar, then takes a long time stirring. I sense he has had his say and is waiting for me to respond.  
  
  “I didn't mean to start any uprisings,” I tell him.  
  
  “I believe you. It doesn't matter. Your stylist turned out to be prophetic in his wardrobe choice. Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was on fire, you have provided a spark that, left unattended, may grow to an inferno that destroys Panem,” he says.  
  
  “Why don't you just kill me now?” I blurt out. “Publicly?” he asks. “That would only add fuel to the flames.”  
  
  “Arrange an accident, then,” I say.  
  
  “Who would buy it?” he asks. “Not you, if you were watching.”  
  
  “Then just tell me what you want me to do. I'll do it,” I say.  
  
  “If only it were that simple.” He picks up one of the flowered cookies and examines it. “Lovely. Your mother made these?”  
  
  “Peeta.” And for the first time, I find I can't hold his gaze. I reach for my tea but set it back down when I hear the cup rattling against the saucer. To cover I quickly take a cookie.  
  
  “Peeta. How is the love of your life?” he asks. “Good,” I say.  
  
  “At what point did he realize the exact degree of your indifference?” he asks, dipping his cookie in his tea. “I'm not indifferent,” I say.  
  
  “But perhaps not as taken with the young man as you would have the country believe,” he says. “Who says I'm not?” I say.  
  
  “I do,” says the president. “And I wouldn't be here if I were the only person who had doubts. How's the handsome cousin?”  
  
  “I don't know ... I don't ...” My revulsion at this conversation, at discussing my feelings for two of the people I care most about with President Snow, chokes me off.  
  
  “Speak, Miss Everdeen. Him I can easily kill off if we don't come to a happy resolution,” he says. “You aren't doing him a favor by disappearing into the woods with him each Sunday.”  
  
  If he knows this, what else does he know? And how does he know it? Many people could tell him that Gale and I spend our Sundays hunting. Don't we show up at the end of each one loaded down with game? Haven't we for years? The real question is what he thinks goes on in the woods beyond District 12. Surely they haven't been tracking us in there. Or have they? Could we have been followed? That seems impossible. At least by a person. Cameras? That never crossed my mind until this moment. The woods have always been our place of safety, our place beyond the reach of the Capitol, where we're free to say what we feel, be who we are. At least before the Games. If we've been watched since, what have they seen? Two people hunting, saying treasonous things against the Capitol, yes. But not two people in love, which seems to be President Snow's implication. We are safe on that charge. Unless ... unless ...  
  
  It only happened once. It was fast and unexpected, but it did happen.  
  
  After Peeta and I got home from the Games, it was several weeks before I saw Gale alone. First there were the obligatory celebrations. A banquet for the victors that only the most high-ranking people were invited to. A holiday for the whole district with free food and entertainers brought in from the Capitol. Parcel Day, the first of twelve, in which food packages were delivered to every person in the district. That was my favorite. To see all those hungry kids in the Seam running around, waving cans of applesauce, tins of meat, even candy. Back home, too big to carry, would be bags of grain, ca  
ns of oil. To know that once a month for a year they would all receive another parcel. That was one of the few times I actually felt good about winning the Games.  
  
  So between the ceremonies and events and the reporters documenting my every move as I presided and thanked and kissed Peeta for the audience, I had no privacy at all. After a few weeks, things finally died down. The camera crews and reporters packed up and went home. Peeta and I assumed the cool relationship we've had ever since. My family settled into our house in the Victor's Village. The everyday life of District 12—workers to the mines, kids to school — resumed its usual pace. I waited until I thought the coast was really clear, and then one Sunday, without telling anyone, I got up hours before dawn and took off for the woods.  
  
  The weather was still warm enough that I didn't need a jacket. I packed along a bag filled with special foods, cold chicken and cheese and bakery bread and oranges. Down at my old house, I put on my hunting boots. As usual, the fence was not charged and it was simple to slip into the woods and retrieve my bow and arrows. I went to our place, Gale's and mine, where we had shared breakfast the morning of the reaping that sent me into the Games.  
  
  I waited at least two hours. I'd begun to think that he'd given up on me in the weeks that had passed. Or that he no longer cared about me. Hated me even. And the idea of losing him forever, my best friend, the only person I'd ever trusted with my secrets, was so painful I couldn't stand it. Not on top of everything else that had happened. I could feel my eyes tearing up and my throat starting to close the way it does when I get upset.  
  
  Then I looked up and there he was, ten feet away, just watching me. Without even thinking, I jumped up and threw my arms around him, making some weird sound that combined laughing, choking, and crying. He was holding me so tightly that I couldn't see his face, but it was a really long time before he let me go and then he didn't have much choice, because I'd gotten this unbelievably loud case of the hiccups and had to get a drink.  
  
  We did what we always did that day. Ate breakfast. Hunted and fished and gathered. Talked about people in town. But not about us, his new life in the mines, my time in the arena. Just about other things. By the time we were at the hole in the fence that's nearest the Hob, I think I really believed that things could be the same. That we could go on as we always had. I'd given all the game to Gale to trade since we had so much food now. I told him I'd skip the Hob, even though I was looking forward to going there, because my mother and sister didn't even know I'd gone hunting and they'd be wondering where I was. Then suddenly, as I was suggesting I take over the daily snare run, he took my face in his hands and kissed me.  
  
  I was completely unprepared. You would think that after all the hours I'd spent with Gale—watching him talk and laugh and frown — that I would know all there was to know about his lips. But I hadn't imagined how warm they would feel pressed against my own. Or how those hands, which could set the most intricate of snares, could as easily entrap me. I think I made some sort of noise in the back of my throat, and I vaguely remember my fingers, curled tightly closed, resting on his chest. Then he let go and said, “I had to do that. At least once.” And he was gone.  
  
  Despite the fact that the sun was setting and my family would be worried, I sat by a tree next to the fence. I tried to decide how I felt about the kiss, if I had liked it or resented it, but all I really remembered was the pressure of Gale's lips and the scent of the oranges that still lingered on his skin. It was pointless comparing it with the many kisses I'd exchanged with Peeta. I still hadn't figured out if any of those counted. Finally I went home.  
  
  That week I managed the snares and dropped off the meat with Hazelle. But I didn't see Gale until Sunday. I had this whole speech worked out, about how I didn't want a boyfriend and never planned on marrying, but I didn't end up using it. Gale acted as if the kiss had never happened.  
  
  Maybe he was waiting for me to say something. Or kiss him back. Instead I just pretended it had never happened, either. But it had. Gale had shattered some invisible barrier between us and, with it, any hope I had of resuming our old, uncomplicated friendship. Whatever I pretended, I could never look at his lips in quite the same way.  
  
  This all flashes through my head in an instant as President Snow's eyes bore into me on the heels of his threat to kill Gale. How stupid I've been to think the Capitol would just ignore me once I'd returned home! Maybe I didn't know about the potential uprisings. But I knew they were angry with me. Instead of acting with the extreme caution the situation called for, what have I done? From the president's point of view, I've ignored Peeta and flaunted my preference for Gale's company before the whole district. And by doing so made it clear I was, in fact, mocking the Capitol. Now I've endangered Gale and his family and my family and Peeta, too, by my carelessness.

In coffee, it's all about puck screens, WDT tools, distribution needles, precision tampers—tiny accessories people swear make a huge difference. Audiophiles do the same with expensive speaker cables, gold-plated connectors, and vibration isolators.

The thing is, there’s almost no evidence these things actually do anything—especially when there haven’t been proper double-blind tests to prove a real difference. Most of it comes down to personal belief, confirmation bias, and groupthink.

I’m F (26), working and still figuring life out hahaha. I have this one guy, M (27) who is so consistent with me. Way back 2014 high school days, he is already courting me. True enough, I gave him a shot after three years,  yet I don’t think we were compatible at that time. I was hoping for someone who can give me attention, he’s always busy during those times, don’t get me wrong I completely understand him, that’s why I decided to end it.

Years passed by, we always see each other often since we have the same circle of friends. He’s still persistent, however during those years it’s either I have a boyfriend or he has a girlfriend. In other words, we are always in a bad timing. Then pandemic came, I was so heartbroken during those times and he was my confidant. I was so blinded by the thought of being heartbroken that I have taken him for granted.

Love did change me, I became cold and learned to play with men. He’s still there, he’s also dating women. Our friends would always say “kayo nalang pala” and yet, we would laughed it off. I was so shocked when one time we were having coffee he asked me “okay ka for one night stand?” Not that, I am feeling virgin or what, but because I never thought he would ask me such. I played dumb “may irereto ka?” Hahaha and he laugh as well. I shrug that idea too, maybe he was just joking around. Weeks passed by, he chatted and asked me the same question. I answered “baka di mo rin mapanindigan”.

He didn’t reply, at the back of my mind maybe he was just busy or wasn’t able to receive my message. I was surprised when I saw him at the party of our friend, he was with someone. We congratulated him, we were all happy for him. I was. But when I got home, it sinks in. I am hurt. I felt betrayed. I felt lost. I don’t know what to do.

I chatted him “I don’t know if you’ll be able to read this, but I think you deserve to know. I love you”

Honestly, I was not expecting he’ll reply yet he did.

I grew up in a small town, studied here, and my friends, family, and my girlfriend all live here. I'm now in my late 20s and have been working in tech consulting(implementation of software for clients) as a Junior Consultant for about a year. My girlfriend also lives nearby and will continue studying here for another 2 to 2.5 years.

At the moment, I mostly work from home. This is mainly because the nearest office is about 2 to 2.5 hours away by car or train. Additionally, my department colleagues are spread out across the country. Even if I went into the office, I’d probably only meet one or two of them – if they happen to be there and aren’t also working remotely. On top of that, the people I work with on projects aren’t necessarily based at the same office either – some are located in other countries, and many also work fully remotely. Also, Client visits are rare - perhaps a few times a year (if at all)

Now, it can get quite lonely working from home all the time. That’s why I often ask myself whether moving closer to an office would be worth it – just to have the option to go in more frequently. It would definitely be a big step out of my comfort zone, especially since life in a big city (on my own – my girlfriend, as mentioned, still has 2 to 2.5 years of studying left and couldn’t move with me) is a very different experience.

On the other hand, I wonder if relocating closer to an office would really be “worth it”? Honestly, it’s not just about being around people – it’s also about building connections, potentially getting involved in more interesting projects, and maybe increasing the chances of a promotion. But then the question is: would I actually meet the relevant people in person – randomly at the coffee machine or wherever? What if they’re also mostly working from home when I am at the office? Then I’d still be working alone, just now in a big city - 2 to 2.5 hours away from my family and girlfriend.

The air is thick with twang, the vibe is corporate rustic, and Kendrick is barely holding the line. Let’s wade into the mediocrity.

**1. “Ordinary” – Alex Warren**  
A historic week: “Ordinary” is now our No. 1 song, which feels less like a victory and more like a clerical error no one bothered fixing. This isn’t a chart-topper—it’s a prolonged sigh in audio form. We did not fight through five decades of musical innovation for *this* to be the summit.

**2. “What I Want” – Morgan Wallen ft. Tate McRae**  
We know what *you* want, Morgan, and it’s apparently to turn every duet into a hostage negotiation. Tate McRae sounds like she’s doing community service. At least we’re spared another solo Wallen vocal—baby steps.

**3. “Just In Case” – Morgan Wallen**  
Just in case what? Just in case you hadn’t heard enough of the exact same chord progression six times in a row? This is the human equivalent of refreshing your email and seeing “no new messages.”

**4. “I'm The Problem” – Morgan Wallen**  
You don’t get to name the song this and expect praise for self-awareness. It’s giving “emotional damage as a brand strategy.” He’s said sorry, sure—but like a guy who knows it’ll boost streams.

**5. “Luther” – Kendrick Lamar & SZA**  
Still here. Still vastly overqualified for this environment. Kendrick’s persistence is now a small act of resistance, like an unpaid intern refusing to get coffee. Every week it stays is a moral victory.

**6. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” – Shaboozey**  
Honestly? At this point, this song is less of a party anthem and more of a stubborn raccoon that refuses to leave your yard. It’s chewed its way into the Top 10 and built a nest.

**7. “Die With A Smile” – Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars**  
This song died with a smile 15 weeks ago. Now it’s just rotting with one. There’s nothing left to say except: release it, Billboard. Let it go.

**8. “Lose Control” – Teddy Swims**  
90+ weeks of emotional inertia. We’re now in the final act of the rom-com where you realize the lead just needs therapy. Every note sounds like it’s asking for a hug it will not receive.

**9. “Nokia” – Drake**  
Drake’s obsession with irrelevant tech continues. Somewhere there’s a dusty flip phone blushing. It’s like he tried to write a love song but got distracted Googling himself.

**10. “Beautiful Things” – Benson Boone**  
Still sitting politely at the bottom like it’s waiting for its number to be called at the DMV. It’s soft, clean, and uninspiring—like a hotel hand towel.

# And there you have it: the Week of June 7, where Ordinary became a prophecy, Morgan staged a five-track coup, and Kendrick Lamar continued to deliver spiritual CPR to a dying chart. Tune in next week to find out whether Billboard actually remembers other genres exist—or if this is just country purgatory now.",1,1749359279.0,billbored,0,1.0,False

**AITAH for telling my fiancé I won’t help pay the mortgage?**

For some background, I, 29F and my fiancé 30M have been together for 10 years. We had a baby back in 2020 and I lost my job around the same time. Our lease to our apartment was up and my grandma offered for us to move in with her so we did. We basically had our own little apartment rent free. I had thrown the idea of going to school out there and everyone agreed it was a good idea, my fiancé paid for it and my grandma watched my baby while I went to class. I graduate this semester (I did part time for a couple semesters). My fiancé has been making 90K a year for the past couple years and 70K when we first moved in. He’s saved a good amount of money.

We agreed to wait to get married until I finished school and we could buy a house together. We’ve been looking at houses more seriously for a past couple months and found one we both love. We started talking to a mortgage broker and that’s when he dropped the bomb on it being HIM and ONLY HIM on the mortgage and the deed. He said I wouldn’t have anything to do with it. I didn’t say anything in the meeting but afterwards I told him I thought WE were buying the house together and I’d pay half the mortgage. He said I would be paying half the mortgage but my name just wouldn’t be on it. So I told him that would mean I’d have no right to the house and he said he knew?!! He said since he saved the 40% down that it’s only fair that he has the rights to the house in case we end things.

I told him if that’s what he wants to do then I’m not paying for the mortgage. I said this isn’t a partnership and if he just wants his own place fine but I’m not paying for it. He called me a btch saying that he paid for everything for the past few years including my schooling. I told him I stayed home and watched our child so we didn’t have to pay for daycare and that ended up saving us money since I would’ve been only able to work part time. He said he didn’t care and I need to pay for half since I already agreed to it.

So reddit AITAH for refusing to pay the mortgage?

ETA: Originally we were supposed to move in with my grandma for a few months while we saved some money for renting a new place. I thought maybe it’d be a good idea to go to school so I’d make more money and we could potentially buy a place. My grandma said we should stay with her until I finish school so we can save up “for a life together”. My fiancé and I had AGREED that we would be buying a house together. He paid for the schooling because we were getting MARRIED and my student loans would’ve been OUR problem, not just mine. He encouraged me to finish my education so we could give our child a better quality of life.

Edit 2: For those of you saying him paying for my schooling would be more expensive than rent, my schooling in TOTAL costed $17,000. Across 5 years. That’s $3400 a year on average.

**Comments**

**ogo7**

*Are you still living in your grandma’s place rent free? If so, I’d stay there and start saving for your own down payment.*

**MistyTulipss**

*Staying at grandma’s could be a great way to get your finances in order without the pressure of this situation. Saving for your own place and building your financial independence could give you more freedom in the future…*

**Top\_Development8243**

*If op goes this route she also needs to file for child support. That can be used towards a home for their child. Even though is not the way op had been expecting.*

**Corfiz74**

*And grandma should be charging him rent for as far back as legally possible.*

**decadecency**

*Yeah WTF. Rich of him to live rent free at someone else's grandma's place and then turn around and go ""well, this saved me a CRAP TON of money to invest in MY OWN HOME WITHOUT MY PARTNER AND MOTHER OF MY KIDS!"" What an ASSHOLE. Why isn't he single and childfree if he doesn't want to share anything?! This is most likely NOT what granny had in mind when she decided to help out.*

**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***

**Update - 1 day later**

So first thank you to everyone who commented, a lot of you had great insight and were very supportive. To those who weren’t I got to see a perspective of how my fiancé might be feeling so thank you for that too. (although some of you were extremely misogynistic)

To answer some questions, my grandma offered to give us a place to stay for a few months while i looked for a job and so we could save some money (this was the beginning of the lockdown and no one was sure what the job market would look like). I had brought up finishing my degree and my grandma offered to watch my baby while I was in class. My fiancé said he’d pay for it since we didn’t have to pay for rent or daycare. He called it an “investment in our future”. I got a pell grant and a scholarship so he ended up only having to pay, on average, $3400 a year for the schooling. If i wasn’t going to school, my grandma didn’t want us staying there long term. This was purely her trying to give us a leg up and help US in OUR future. She wouldn’t have done so if she knew what my fiancé was going to do, she’s said this.

For the update, I told my fiancé we needed to talk about this arrangement and I asked why he changed his mind all of the sudden. He said he worked hard for his money and didn’t want to lose everything if we got divorced. I said that was fair but he’s now putting ME in a position to lose everything if I have zero rights to the property. He said I didn’t save up the money so the house should be his and his alone until and unless I put down 40% also.

I asked if he’d consider a prenup that would give him the 40% he put down and we’d split 50/50 the rest of the equity. I said this would protect the lump sum he put down while also giving me equity Id be paying for. He said he’d have to think about it but he doesn’t like the idea of having to sell if we split. I said then he can get his own place that he can afford on his own if he doesn’t want me on the title that badly. (This one he could barely afford with just his income not sure if he’d even be approved for the mortgage on his own tbh)

I also mentioned that I wanted to do couples therapy before we get married. He said no. That we didn’t need therapy and I just needed to “listen to him”. That was the end of the conversation.

I don’t know who this person is. This is not the man I had a child with. The man i had a child with massaged me every night while I was pregnant, he listened attentively to every random thing I wanted to talk about, he treated me with the upmost respect, he was the only person I wanted with me while I gave birth. He used to say he could never hurt me or screw me over because it’d hurt our child. I love him so much. I don’t know what happened.

**Comments**

**Orisha\_Oshun**

*I would not marry this man or buy a house with him. Time to set up some co parenting guidelines and go yer separate ways. He showed you who he is. Believe him.*

**Vegetable-Cod-2340**

*Yup, see a lawyer about custody, child support and get a 3rd party coparenting app, because anyone that’s say op needs to ‘just listen to him’ won’t be the easiest person to coparent with. Someone where along the way maybe because he was the main breadwinner, he just started believing that his voice was the only one that matters and you can’t have a good relationship with that mentality.*

**Neither-Entrance-208**

It's easy to be the breadwinner when you don't have to pay rent or daycare. I wonder if they helped OP's grandma out with utilities and the food bill for the last four years.

Let him have his house, and let the relationship end. He's not talking like a partner. He's talking like an adversary. I wouldn't be shocked if this guy is trying to end the relationship with this stunt

OP, I'm sorry you are hurting right now. You gave a completely valid compromise on a prenup. Wouldn't even accept relationship counseling? Not ok.

He wants access to your money, your support system while giving you no security. You deserve better. Stay with your gran and start saving for yourself. If the relationship ends, file for child support. Your child deserves to be provided for.

**Inconsistent\_Reader\_**

OP, you need to run. This can get very dangerous very fast.

This man is desperately trying to overpower and control every aspect of your life. It starts with it being HIS house, then it's HIS MONEY, HIS CHILD and your NOTHING.

I don't want to scare you, but it feels as though he ""baby trapped"" you. Meaning even if you decide to leave him, you'll be tied by the child you share.

He doesn't want to do therapy because he is aware of his behavior. He knows what he's doing. The therapist will know his true intentions and expose them. He's trying to gaslight you into thinking he's not being abusive.

Please get separate accounts and stay at your grandmother's place until you can get a place away from him.

>OOP: We do have separate accounts thankfully. He’ll have zero access to my money once I start my job in a couple weeks.



**Update - 1 day later**



Thank you to everyone who commented on my last post. You’ve shown me i’m not alone in this and that other people have gone through the same. I also feel vindicated in my decision to not pay half the mortgage if i’m not on the deed, thank you.

Anyways, tonight he and I got to talking about the arrangement again. He said he didn’t want to do the prenup I mentioned in my last update. So I told him my final offer was couples therapy AND getting married before we buy a house. I told him we should get a rental temporarily until we figure everything out and come to an agreement. He outright refused, again. He said he didn’t want to “waste money” renting. He then said I’m not entitled to any of his money and he won’t buy a house after we marry because i’ll just “win it in a divorce”. I said fine we won’t get married. He asked if I was breaking up with him and I said I didn’t know, but I needed space.

He. Lost. It. Called me a btch and a gold digger and told me I “owe” him $30,000. (I don’t know where he got this number from) He said i’m “used up” and no one will ever want me again. He went on ranting, yelling at me, for about 3 minutes until my grandma came over to us and told him to leave.

He’s staying the night at a hotel and has called me repeatedly. He’s left a few angry voicemails. I feel so numb. My baby is confused and keeps asking why I’m upset and where their dad went. I hate this so much.

To everyone who mentioned he might’ve gotten in with the manosphere/ red pill content, you were right. I looked at who he’s subscribed to on youtube, sure enough I saw Joe Rogan, Fresh and Fit podcast, justpearlythings, and adin ross. Safe to say he’s fallen down the manosphere rabbit hole. I know the man i fell in love with is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it.

There were definitely signs I didn’t notice, he always said he was saving “his money”, and HE was buying a house. He also said, on more than one occasion, he was the “man of the house”. He got really big on being a “provider and protector”. I didn’t put it all together until now. His behavior change has been pretty recently, like the last 8-9 months.

That’s it. My life is a shit show. Writing it out has been somewhat therapeutic. Thank you all again for your support!

*Keep the voicemails and messages he sends. You may need them. Get ready to go to court to custody and child support. Do not be alone with this man. Edit: Grandma is awesome. If he comes back and is yelling and acting up call the cops.*

*And props to your grandma for sticking up for you. She is AMAZING!!!!*

**Gracelandrocks**

*yeah, if fiancé is asking for money, remind him that grandma would want back rent.*

*Your life is not a shit show! Imagine if you moved into that house, paid for a few years and actually married him! That would be a colossal shit show. I'm so sorry you are going through this but you found out before taking these next big steps. You have your degree, family support and your kid. You will be fine ♥️ please talk to a good lawyer.. custody, child support and save and document everything*

>OOP: Thank you, you’re right. It could’ve been a whole hell of a lot worse lol



**Update - 1 month later**



I’ve had a lot of people reach out and ask for an update so here it is. A few days after my last update he texted me and asked if we could meet to talk. I agreed and left my kid with my grandma and met him at a coffee shop. He started with an apology and went on about how that wasn’t him and he’s a good guy he just drank too much and lost control.

He asked me if I wanted to get married still and I said no. He asked if he could move back in so we could “work on things” and I said no. He even offered to do couples therapy and I said I’d have to think about it. He got quiet and asked if I ever even loved him. I said I did but I can’t handle the whole woe is me thing he’s been doing. I said I would have never tried to screw him over in the case of a divorce and that if I didn’t love him I would’ve never had a kid with him. I said he needs to do individual therapy before i’d consider doing couples therapy with him.

He got angry and yelled that I needed therapy more than he did and he refused to do it without me. He got up and said he’s going to take me to court and fight for full custody and that I’d never “see a dime” from him. I’m assuming he meant child support.

Since then he tried dropping by unannounced to take our kid. My grandmas lawyer friend (technically her friends son) told me that since we don’t have a custody agreement in place it’s a free for all and he could legally take him across state lines. He said it can be much more difficult to get him back especially if we don’t know where he is. So I didn’t let him take our kid but said he’s welcome to come visit but he’s not leaving with him until we have a custody arrangement in place. That ended about as well as you could imagine.

My grandma told me I can stay as long as I need and I got my kid signed up for daycare. That’s all for now. I’m hoping we can find an arrangement without courts but we’ll see.

*You need to get a lawyer stat and discuss the situation with the daycare. You don’t want him showing up to the daycare and taking your son without you knowing.*

**Mirabai503**

*100% I’m hoping we can find an arrangement without courts but we’ll see. OP, this is not an option. This person is too mercurial. You need a lawyer, and to ask for parenting classes, all communication through a parenting app, no interstate or international travel, fair visitation for him. It is just too much of a risk to do this outside the court system.*

**Jasminefirefly**

*Lawyer here. Every moment you don’t get a lawyer and file for custody you are risking losing your child. This is far more serious than you are treating it. He could take the child out of state and file for custody in that jurisdiction and you might never get anything but occasional visitation. Please GET A LAWYER NOW.*

I really enjoy the game Darkle. It's this dice game where you get 6 dice and have to roll until you get to 5k points. Whoever gets to 5k first wins. 

Now, the problem with these games is that they are the definition of an ad apocalypse. These games have ways to slowly get you to ""pay-in"". They get you addicted on the premise that you're only playing *""games you love*"" and ""*why not have a chance* at winning *big prizes* if you were going to *play anyway?*""

The ads in these games are also *ads to other freemium games.* But you keep playing to win about a dollar after hours of game time. You *want* to beat these games because you *win badges and praise*. You're winning! But you don't win. 

Eventually, you get annoyed with the ads and want to pay for their premium of $# to get rid of ads for a set time. Then you want to pay for powerups to ""beat"" these games. It doesn't end. 

Or you rationalize with yourself. You choose *not to pay* for these games. But you let the ad apocalypse run wild over you. You become part of the fold. All until you can say, ""I won $30 after a week of pulling all-nighters."" *But don't worry it's a good way to pass the time if you can't sleep. It's a good way to pass the time if you're in the backseat. Taking a walk. Taking a dump. Watching a movie. Waiting in line.*  

Lastly, you'll realize. You've been programmed to watch abut 8 hours of content on the same 4 ads promoting 4 different premium games. You get bored of the one you're on and decide to download one of those 4 games. 

  
Worse, you forget about the ads. You download one of those games because you subconsciously *think* you like this game. It's a good way to pass the time and make coffee money.  So, then you're stuck in the same loop. 

It's free until it's not. It's free until you realize what the game is costing you.

It’s at this place he loves. They do duck hash and weirdly strong Irish coffee. We’ve been going there every now and then since I was a teenager.

My parents divorced when I was 5. My dad wasn’t always consistent when I was younger (he used to forget birthdays or cancel plans), but over the past few years he’s really tried. He shows up now. We’ve rebuilt a relationship, and this brunch is part of that.

Here’s the issue: my mom remarried when I was 9. My stepdad (Rick) is… fine. He’s not mean or anything, but he’s always been a little standoffish. He never tried to connect with me beyond the surface. No “how was your day,” no bonding moments. He literally once asked me if I wanted to “call him Dad or whatever” while driving me to soccer when I was 12, and I just said “uh, I’m good.” That was kind of the end of it.

Fast forward to this week... my mom found out I was doing Father’s Day brunch with my dad and got weirdly quiet. Then later she called and asked if I’d thought about inviting Rick. I said no, it was just something between me and Dad. She said, “Well, Rick’s been more of a father to you than your real dad ever was,” which honestly rubbed me the wrong way.

I snapped a little and said, “Rick’s not my dad. He never tried to be. Don’t guilt me for spending time with the one who actually wants a relationship with me now.”

She hung up on me.

Now I’m the villain. She texted me yesterday saying I “hurt Rick’s feelings” and that I made her feel like “everything she tried to do for me as a mom was for nothing.” I didn’t even respond. I’ve been staring at the message for a day and just feeling… kind of sick about it.

My boyfriend says I’m not wrong but I “probably didn’t need to say it like that.” My aunt texted me, vaguely hinting that I should “keep peace” in the family and “be mature about it.”

Ok I really shouldn't go with him, I hardly know him and he has a bad reputation. But he honestly seems so sweet He could obviously sense my indecision, ""I promise I won't try anything on you jailbait, Scouts honour, I just want to buy you a milkshake for your birthday"" he said pointing into the car and smiling a dazzling smile. I took a deep breath and got into the car, he shut the door with a chuckle. He obviously liked getting his own way  He drove us in silence, his car was nice, I have no idea about cars so I didn't know what sort it was but it was clean and smelled like leather and his aftershave. I actually felt quite relaxed considering that I was alone in a car with an older guy I knew hardly anything about and no one knew where I was. Oh crap this is a really bad idea, where the hell is he taking me? Just then he pulled into this little diner and stopped the car. We got out and he held the door to the diner open for me, ""Wow very gentlemanly"" I said with a smile. I can be a gentleman when I want to be, I just don't want to be that often"" he said with a cheeky grin, I rolled my eyes at him and sat in one of the booths.  
  
  He sat opposite me as the waitress came over and gave him a very seductive smile, ""Well hello, what can I do for you?"" she asked looking at him.  
  
  ""I'll have a chocolate shake with extra ice-cream and, jailbait?"" he said looking at me and raising his eyebrows.  
  
  The waitress dragged her eyes away from Blake to look me over and give me a sneer, ""Err I'll have a strawberry shake please"" I said shrugging, jeez I felt uncomfortable the woman looked like she wanted to stab me or something.  
  
  ""Put extra ice-cream in hers too would ya?"" he said turning back to me, ""Trust me on this one"" he said with a wink laughing. The woman smiled at him again but he was too busy reaching across the table to notice.  
  
  He took my hand and I just sat there in shock, I mean jeez this guy is too old for me, and he's incredibly hot. What the hell is he holding my hand for? I pulled my hand back putting it in my lap, he looked a little hurt but smiled to cover it up. ""So what did you get for your birthday?"" he asked with a grin.  
  
  ""Well, aside from a new charm for my cell, my Mom and Brian got me a new ipod, and Clay got me this bracelet"" I said jiggling my wrist to make it shine when I caught the sun. He reached out and took hold of my wrist gently bringing it to him so he could look at it.  
  
  ""It's pretty"" he said taking hold of my hand again.  
  
  I tried to pull away again but he frowned slightly and gripped my hand a little tighter ""Please?"" he said quietly, I looked into his eyes and could feel myself being drawn in. I stopped struggl  
ing and let him hold my hand. It actually felt nice, different from when Clay held my hand, when Clay and I held hands it was just natural, normal like breathing but this felt nice in a different way, his hand was warm and slightly rough to the touch.  
  
  The waitress came over and placed our drinks down giving me another dirty look as she walked away. I took a big swig of my milkshake and oh my God it was good!  
  
  ""Wow I think that's the best milkshake I've ever had"" I said taking another mouthful.  
  
  He nodded ""Yeah I thought you'd like it"" he said with a wink.  
  
  ""So how old are you exactly Blake?"" I asked grabbing a spoon so I could eat the ice-cream that was floating at the top of my milkshake.  
  
  ""I turned 21 two months ago"" he said frowning looking a little upset about something.  
  
  ""So what's with the face? You don't like being 21?"" I asked giggling,  
  
  ""I don't mind the age, it's just that I waited a long time to find someone that I liked and when I finally do she's so much friggin younger than me it's not even legal!"" he said huffing and stabbing his straw into his milkshake forcefully. I smiled but quickly pushed it away, he liked me? Oh my God! But there's nothing we can do about it, if I had sex with him he could be charged with statutory rape due to my age.  
  
  ""Oh you like someone? Do I know her?"" I asked with a smirk.  
  
  ""It's not a joke Riley"" he snapped shaking his head. Oops ok temper. ""Sorry I didn't mean to snap at you like that, it's just so frustrating"" he said squeezing my hand slightly.  
  
  It was quiet for a minute I didn't know what to say so we both just stared at the table. ""So tell me some more about you"" he said looking up with an easy smile.  
  
  ""What do you want to know?"" I said sipping my milkshake again grateful for the conversation, I hated uneasy silences.  
  
  ""Hmm what kind of music do you like? What do you like to do in your spare time? What's your favourite colour? That kind of thing"" he said waving his free hand around.

Well I like R&B stuff mostly, Anything by 'Ne-yo' is my favourite, I like to dance and go to the movies and I know it sounds boring but I love to read and my favourite colour is pink"" I said smiling.  
  
  ""What about you? Are you in college or something or do you work?"" I asked,  
  
  ""At the moment I'm working at Old Joes over on east street, it's a scrap yard but I don't really want to be doing that so I'm always looking for something else"" he said with a shrug.  
  
  We chatted for about an hour and then he paid for our drinks, taking my hand to help me out of the booth, which gained me another glare from the waitress. She stepped in front of him and put her hand on his chest, ""Can I get your number?"" she asked sexily, trailing her finger down his abs.  
  
  He chuckled and raised our intertwined hands, ""Seriously? You think you have a chance when I'm holding her hand?"" he asked shaking his head and pulling me to the exit.  
  
  I was stunned, I almost choked on my laughter, quickly putting my hand over my mouth and turning it into a cough, but it was too late she gave me a death glare and stormed off. He didn't seem phased in the slightest just pulled me out the door and opened the passenger side for me. ""Jeez did you have to be so rude? I thought she was gonna stab me or something"" I said laughing and shaking my head.  
  
  He chuckled ""I wasn't rude! What the hell was I supposed to say? You would rather I gave her my number to be polite?"" he asked smiling.  
  
  ""No, but you could have just said no thanks or something, you didn't need to bring me into it"" I said slapping him playfully on the arm.  
  
  We arrived at school with five minutes to spare, he pulled into the now almost empty car park. ""So you think I could get your number?"" he asked nervously, he looked so sweet and vulnerable, not like what I had been told about him at all. He hadn't even tried to kiss me and he turned the waitress down and didn't even pay any attention to her.  
  
  ""Err Blake, what's the point? This can't go anywhere"" I said with a shrug. He sighed.  
  
  ""Please can I have your number? Lets just see, please, a date that's all, I really like you"" he said scratching absentmindedly at his jaw. Ok what harm could it do? A date that's all, it doesn't mean I have to sleep with him, but oh jeez Clay will go crazy. Why the hell am I thinking about Clay?  
  
  ""Jailbait?"" he said snapping me out of my mental debate.  
  
  ""Err, yeah ok, I guess"" I said taking the phone that he was now holing out to me and punching in my number. He had a huge smile showing all of his perfect teeth and I couldn't help but smile back. ""I better go, Clay will be out soon"" I said climbing out of the car.  
  
  ""Ok, well I'll call you"" he said as I shut the door. It had turned cold so I pulled my jacket tighter around me as I walked to the field. Suddenly my phone started ringing, I looked at the screen, it said Blake, I frowned, how the hell did I get his number? Oh yeah he stored it in my phone that first night at the game!  
  
  ""Hello?"" I answered,  
  
  ""Just checking you gave me the right number"" he said and laughed before hanging up, I laughed too as I snapped the phone shut, I looked at the little rose charm and smiled as I put it back in my pocket.  
  
  ""Hey Riley bear"" Clay called as I reached the field, he jogged over to me and went to throw an arm around my shoulder but I quickly jumped away.  
  
  ""No way, look at the state of you"" I said horrified looking at him, he was covered in mud and sweat and grass. He looked down at himself and laughed then his head snapped up to look at me with an evil glint in his eye, oh shit! I turned and ran, I could hear him chasing behind me laughing. He grabbed me from behind and rubbed his face in my hair, ""Ew! Clay!"" I whined giggling, he just laughed and threw his arm over my shoulder leading us off of the field.  
  
  ""Sorry you had to wait for me, lucky you waited inside though it's getting cold out here"" he said pulling me closer to his side. I opened my mouth to tell him I'd been with Blake but nothing came out, oh just man up and tell him Riley! I took a deep breath, ""So what movie you wanna watch tonight?"" he asked just as I was about to speak.  
  
  ""Um, I don't mind, how about New Moon?"" I said and he groaned.  
  
  ""Jeez the shifter again? Haven't you seen enough of him already?"" he whined making me laugh.  
  
  ""No way you can never get enough Taylor Lautner in your life"" I said with a smile as I pushed him towards the locker rooms to shower.  
  
  Just as I thought they would, my Mom and Brian pulled out a cake after dinner and they sang happy birthday to me. I looked over at Clay he wasn't singing, he knew I hated it. He never sang happy birthday to me, but he sat there with a huge smirk on his face while I grimaced and wriggled uncomfortable. They even made me blow out the candles like a five year old.  
  
  We watched New Moon again and Clay bless him didn't complain once, even though I'd made him watch it about 6 times already. Just as we settled into bed to go to sleep my phone beeped, I looked at the screen 1 new message from Blake. I pressed read, 'Hey just wanted to say goodnight, maybe I could take you for a crappy dinner and a crappy movie tomorrow? Blake ;) ' I laughed.  
  
  ""What's so funny?"" Clay asked putting his arms behind his head,  
  
  ""Err nothing just Rachel that's all"" I answered unsure why I was lying to him. I snapped my phone shut and laid next to him as usual.  
  
  Chapter 4  
  
  ""Crap! It's him! So what do you think? Should I go?"" I asked Rachel quickly, looking at my flashing phone in my hand.  
  
  She looked at me like I was stupid, ""Why the hell are you asking me? It Blake Chambers for God sake! Of course you should go!"" she said rolling her eyes at me. I sighed, I just didn't know what to do, Blake had text me early this morning asking if I would go out tonight at 7, my phone was currently ringing in my hand and I was just staring at it undecided.  
  
  I took a big breath and answered the phone. ""Um Hey"" I said quietly.  
  
  ""Hey Jailbait, you ok? You took a long time to answer"" he said sounding nervous.  
  
  ""Uh yeah I was just err talking to my friend and I didn't feel the phone go off that's all"" I lied grimacing at Rachel who was staring at my phone like a lovesick puppy.  
  
  ""So did you get my message this morning?"" he asked,  
  
  ""Mmm hmm"" I mumbled looking pleadingly at Rachel for something to say, she was frantically nodding her head with wide eyes mouthing 'say yes' over and over.  
  
  ""Ok well do you want to go?"" he asked after a few seconds of silence.  
  
  I looked at Rachel one last time ""Say yes!"" she whisper yelled at me.  
  
  ""Yes"" I said quietly.  
  
  I heard a muffled ""Yessssssssss!"" from the phone that I assume I wasn't meant to hear, ""Kinda excited there are ya?"" I joked smiling in spite of myself.  
  
  ""Uh yeah sorry, you weren't meant to hear that"" he said a bit sheepishly, ""So where do you live?"" he asked I could hear him rustling paper around in the background.  
  
  ""I live on Cotton Road, near the pond, number 17, you know where that is?"" I asked I hoped he did I was useless with directions.  
  
  ""You live on Cotton Road? No wonder your so close to Clay, that's where he lives right?"" he asked sounding a little surprised.  
  
  ""Yeah he lives next door actually"" I answered.  
  
  ""Ok well I know where it is, I've been to Clay's before, so I'll pick you up at 7 then"" he said sounding really excited.  
  
  ""Ok see you then"" I said snapping the phone shut and breathing out a sigh of relief that it was over. Not that talking to him was hard it was actually quite easy but the whole decision thing was a pain in the ass.  
  
  ""Great that's done, so next question, do you tell Clay?"" Rachel said with a smile. I groaned, I couldn't lie to my best friend but at the same time I didn't really want to have to tell him either, he would be seriously pissed about it. ""Ok I have a solution, how about we just avoid him altogether, that way you don't have to lie to him or tell the truth, there's only one period left and you don't have it with him, so just text him and tell him that I'm taking you home tonight so you don't need a lift and that you'  
ll see him tomorrow"" Rachel said. Ok that's not actually a bad idea, that way if the date is a disaster he doesn't have to know and if it's not then I can tell him I went tomorrow!  
  
  ""Ok good plan, we'll make an evil mastermind out of you yet"" I said hugging her tight.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Oh God I was so nervous, I had never been nervous about a date before ever. I left my hair down and added some soft curls and a tiny bit of makeup, I never wore a lot so I didn't want to go too overboard. Rachel had come in after she dropped me home and had helped me pick out an outfit. I was now in a black skinny jeans and a tight red v neck top that showed a little cl\*\*vage but wasn't too slutty, I'd opted for red open toed high heels that would probably kill me if I have to walk or dance in them, but he said dinner and a movie in the text so they should be ok.  
  
  I felt sick, I just kept staring at myself in the mirror, I heard the doorbell ring. ""Holy crap he's early"" I muttered looking at the clock that said five to seven, I bounded out of my room to get the door only to hear voices coming from the hallway. Shit! I stopped out of sight to listen.  
  
  ""So where are you taking my daughter tonight?"" I heard Brian ask, I smiled a little at what he said, he has always called me his daughter, bless him.  
  
  ""Err I thought we would go to this little Italian restaurant that I know and then to go see a movie if that's ok, I mean does she have a curfew or anything?"" Blake asked.  
  
  ""Well it is a school night, you do know she's only 17 right?"" Brian asked, I bounded down the stairs then embarrassed as hell.  
  
  ""Brian! He knows how old I am jeez, leave him alone would you?"" I said giving him a kiss on the cheek and grabbing my black leather jacket, I refused to look at Blake until my cheeks stopped burning but I could feel his eyes on me.  
  
  ""Well like I was saying to Blake here, it's a school night Riley, so your Mom and I agree that you should be home by 11"" he said sternly, I gave him my puppy dog face, pouting my lip slightly.

But Brian, we might not get time to see a movie if I have to be back by then"" I said quietly looking at my feet.  
  
  ""Oh, well ok 11:30, but not a minute past ok"" he said shaking his head, I laughed and kissed his cheek again.  
  
  ""Thanks"" I said with a smile as I turned to face Blake.  
  
  ""I got you these"" he said handing me a dozen red roses, oh my God that is sweet, the only one that ever gave me flowers was Clay.  
  
  ""Wow, Um they're beautiful, thanks"" I said blushing, jeez what do you say? My stepdad was standing there watching me, how embarrassing!  
  
  ""Your welcome"" he said with an easy grin.  
  
  ""Brian could you ask Mom to put these in water for me?"" I asked holding out the flowers for him, he nodded, ""I'll see you later"" I said.  
  
  ""Goodbye Sir"" Blake said holding out a hand, Brian shook it firmly.  
  
  ""You look after her you hear me?"" he said sternly.  
  
  Blake nodded and smiled politely ""I will Sir"" he answered.  
  
  He smiled at me as we walked to the car, ""You look really beautiful"" he said looking me up and down slowly making me feel a little self-conscious.  
  
  ""You don't look bad yourself"" I said, wow that is the understatement of the year! He had on his biker boots nicely ripped jeans and a black shirt that he had left undone a little and had rolled the sleeves up to his elbows, his hair and face were gorgeous as usual. I was so completely checking him out that I didn't even realise that we had got to the car already, he was standing there next to the open door waiting for me to get in and I was too busy staring at him. Holy shit! What an idiot! ""Err sorry, I was just thinking whether I brought my phone or not"" I lied blushing and getting in the car.  
  
  ""You have it?"" he asked I nodded and he smiled before closing the door and walking round to the drivers side. ""You like Italian?"" he asked I nodded and giggled.  
  
  ""Doesn't everyone?"" I asked, he smiled as we pulled out.  
  
  The restaurant was nice, it was small and intimate and perfect for a date, there were candles on each table making it really romantic. ""So you have your Dad completely wrapped around your little finger, are you a Daddies girl?"" he asked while we were eating.  
  
  ""He's not my Dad, he's my Stepdad, but he's really great, he married my Mom when I was like 7, but I guess in a way I'm kind of a Daddies girl, he likes to spoil me and he gangs up on my Mom with me"" I said with a laugh.  
  
  ""He seems like a nice guy"" he said smiling,  
  
  ""Yeah he's the best"" I said.  
  
  ""That good?"" I asked pointing at his lasagne.  
  
  He nodded ""Want some?"" he said holding out a forkful to me,  
  
  ""Wow that's so romantic Blake, you want to feed me?"" I asked jokingly trying not to laugh, he snorted and shook his head putting the forkful in his mouth instead. ""Hey I was gonna eat that I was kidding"" I said grinning, he chuckled and got another forkful and held it out to me, I put my hand over his and brought the fork to my mouth slowly and took the food off the fork slower than normal trying to make it look seductive. I think it had the desired effect because he drew in a jagged breath through his teeth and let it out in a little moan.  
  
  Wow that's tasty, he knows some good places, I bet that's because he's been on a lot of dates. I mentally slapped myself for thinking about him with other girls. ""Wow that is good"" I said after I had finished, I'll have to bring Clay here, he loves lasagne, and my chicken pasta alfredo is awesome so he wouldn't even mind swapping. Clay always does that, he orders something I'll like so that we can swap half way through. Wait why the hell am I thinking about Clay? Jeez Riley you are on a date with a super hot guy and your thinking about your best friend! Stupid, stupid, stupid!  
  
  ""Yeah me and my sister some here a lot to eat"" he said simply digging in again.  
  
  ""Yeah, how old is your sister? Are you close then?"" I asked,  
  
  ""She's 26, and yeah we're pretty close, I live with her actually, my parents died when I was 13, Michelle was 19 so she became my legal guardian after that, she's really great, you'll like her"" he said with a fond smile. Ok did not see that coming, his parents have died?  
  
  ""I'm sorry about your Mom and Dad, but your sister sounds great for taking you on like that and still being a kid herself"" I said kind of in awe of this girl who was two years older than me when she had to start raising a grieving hormonal teenage brother.  
  
  ""Michelle's great, she works here actually, not tonight though, night off"" he said with a grin. I breathed a sigh of relief I didn't really want to be meeting his family on a first date.  
  
  ""And what does your sister think of you dating a minor?"" I asked smirking, there is no way he's told his sister about me. Ha lets see what lie he'll come up with.  
  
  ""Well at first she thought I was crazy but now she just said 'what will be will be', whatever that means"" he said with a shrug, Wow ok he actually looks like he's telling the truth, he must be a good liar.  
  
  ""Hey guys you all done here?"" the waiter asked taking our empty plates,  
  
  ""Can I get you any deserts or coffees?"" he asked Blake looked at me  
  
  ""Jailbait?"" he said cocking his head to the side looking extremely cute.  
  
  ""Umm no thanks"" I said smiling at the waiter.  
  
  ""Ok just the bill then please"" Blake said with a smile.  
  
  ""You don't want a desert? I thought all girls liked desert"" he said frowning and leaning in towards me over the table.  
  
  ""No I like sweets and popcorn"" I said waggling my eyebrows making him laugh.  
  
  We decided to watch a comedy film in the end and he bought popcorn and chocolate. He wouldn't let me pay for anything, he said that I could pay next time and gave me a sly wink saying that then I would need to come out with him again. As we walked past a group of boys standing around the foyer waiting for their screen to be cleaned they all turned to me and started whistling and making cat calls. I felt him stiffen next to me and he grabbed my hand pulling me away from them to his other side protectively, whist shooting them death glares.  
  
  I giggled ""Wow possessive much?"" I asked grabbing a handful of popcorn, he just continued to glare at them until we were at the door to our screen.  
  
  ""So where do you want to sit?"" he asked once we were safely inside.  
  
  ""What? You don't want to sit at the back?"" I asked faking shock, he chuckled,  
  
  ""I would definitely like to sit at the back, I'm asking you where you want to sit"" he said giving my hand that he was holding a little squeeze.  
  
  I chuckled and pulled him forwards ""Lets go for the middle back"" I said giving him a smile.  
  
  He sighed ""Whatever you say Jailbait"" he said following behind me.  
  
  I sat about three quarters of the way down, not too close to the back that he would get funny idea's, not that I didn't want to make out with him because I definitely did. This date was actually going great and I was surprised at what a nice guy he was, well so far anyway. I tried to keep in mind that he was a player but it was hard when he was being so sweet. As the movie started he put his arm over the back of my chair easily and casually as if he thought nothing of it, it was quite sweet actually. His hand was only a few centimetres away from my shoulder so I reached out and tangled my fingers with his pulling his arm around my shoulder instead of being on the chair. I saw him look at me and smile out of the corner of my eye so I just kept looking at the screen. The film was funny and we both actually laughed at the same parts which was good.  
  
  Once it had finished we walked slowly back to the car holding hands, my shoes were really starting to hurt me now, I knew I shouldn't have listened to Rachel. ""You ok?"" he asked when I stopped to take the damn things off,  
  
  ""Yeah my shoes are hurting me, they're new I should have worn them in"" I moaned taking the other one off.  
  
  ""You can't walk barefoot, there could be glass or something"" he said frowning.  
  
  I laughed ""Blake jeez! It'll be fine"" I said staring to walk again.  
  
  ""No way"" he said tuning around and bending down in front  
of me,  
  
  ""What are you doing? Checking for glass?"" I asked laughing at him,  
  
  ""I'm not letting you walk with no shoes so I'll carry you"" he said I could almost hear him roll his eyes at me, I sighed wow this boy is sweet!  
  
  ""I'm heavy"" I warned as I wrapped my hands around his neck and my legs around his waist.  
  
  He just laughed, ""Heavy? Yeah right, I think I can handle it"" he said standing up and wrapping his arms around my thighs. It actually felt quite weird to have another guy do this sort of thing, I was so used to Clay that even Blake's body felt a little wrong between my legs, wow there I go again thinking about Clay!  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  When we pulled into my drive he smiled, ""There I got you home in plenty of time"" he said proudly looking at the clock on his dashboard, it was 11:15, I laughed.  
  
  ""Well thanks for tonight I had fun"" I said honestly smiling.  
  
  ""I did too"" he said smiling his perfect smile showing me all of his teeth. ""I'll walk you to your door"" he said getting out and jogging round to my side to open the door. As I went to step out he grabbed me around the waist and threw me over his shoulder making me scream slightly, he just chuckled, ""Shh, you'll wake the neighbours, I don't want Clay to come and kick my ass"" he joked as he carried me up the steps to my porch and putting my down gently. ""Next time we go out wear more comfortable shoes"" he said nodding at my heels in my hand.  
  
  ""Next time? Who said I want to go out with you again?"" I asked still slightly breathless from being carried.  
  
  He smiled and stepped closer to me his eyes flicking down to my lips. Oh God he's gonna kiss me! He was inching his head forwards slowly giving me the chance to move if I wanted to, I didn't. His lips touched mine gently for a couple of seconds, it felt a little weird because of his piercing but it was still really nice, he made a small moaning sound and then pulled away slowly with a sigh looking at me smiling. Oh my God that was perfect, so sweet, but it has definitely left me wanting more. I gulped and sighed a little.   ""Ok well maybe tomorrow night?"" he asked looking a little nervous again. Oh Crap I can't tomorrow, Wednesday's movie night.  
  
  ""Um I can't I actually have plans with Clay tomorrow, it's kind of tradition we hang out on Wednesdays"" I said almost apologetically, he just nodded without expression. ""I'm free Thursday"" I said I said raising an eyebrow.  
  
  His face brightened, ""Ok Thursday then, I'll pick you up at 7 again?"" he asked beaming.  
  
  ""Sure"" I said smiling at him, he looked so happy. He inched forward again and just as his lips brushed against mine the front door opened and he jumped away quickly.  
  
  ""Oh I thought I heard voices"" My Mom said standing there in her dressing gown.  
  
  ""Hi Mom, err Mom this is Blake, Blake my Mom Sarah"" I said waving between them he reached out a hand and shook hers smiling.  
  
  ""Nice to meet you"" he said  
  
  ""Mmm you too"" my Mom said looking him over, she shot me a look and raised her eyebrows before smirking and going inside.  
  
  ""Ok that was awkward"" I said laughing.  
  
  He chuckled ""Yeah, I better get going, you've got school tomorrow"" he said sarcastically taking the mick out of my age.  
  
  ""Ha ha go on then, I'll see you Thursday"" I said turning to go inside.  
  
  He grabbed my hand stopping me, I looked at his gorgeous face ""Can't wait, sleep well"" he said winking and walking off. I couldn't help it I watched his ass again, jeez that really is a nice ass!  
  
  As soon as I closed the door she was there, I knew she would be, ""Oh my gosh he is so handsome!"" my Mom said fanning her face with wide eyes.  
  
  I giggled ""Don't let Brian hear you say that"" I joked looking around for him.  
  
  ""Oh he already told me he was good looking, he sent me out there so I could get a look"" she said laughing.  
  
  I gasped ""Are you serious? He sent you out to see a fit guy?"" I said shaking my head at him, he really is funny that man.  
  
  She just laughed again, ""He seems like a nice boy despite the piercings, did you have a good time tonight?"" she asked looking me up and down.  
  
  ""Yeah actually I did and he is a nice guy from what I've seen so far"" I said shrugging.  
  
  ""So your going out with him again on Thursday"" she said biting her lip.  
  
  ""Were you listening?"" I cried rolling my eyes at her.  
  
  ""I wasn't listening, I heard that's all, so how was the kiss? Was it good? Did the piercing feel funny?"" she asked. I just laughed jeez my Mom is really great.  
  
  ""It was really nice Mom, now if you'll excuse me I think I'm gonna go to bed"" I said kissing her cheek and walking to the stairs.  
  
  ""Riley?"" she called when I was about two steps up.  
  
  ""Mmm"" I mumbled turning back.  
  
  ""I know he's older than you and therefore probably more experienced, but that doesn't mean you have to rush into anything, but if you do want decide to take things further please be safe and if you need to talk to me about anything you know you can right?"" she asked looking at me lovingly, I smiled yep my Mom is definitely the best.  
  
  ""I know that Mom and thanks"" I said smiling and heading up to bed. I laid awake for a long time thinking about the kiss and how I wanted to kiss him again and again. Suddenly my phone beeped and I read the message:  
  
  'I had a really great time. Thanks, and can't wait for Thursday. Sweet dreams Jailbait'  
  
  I smiled and finally drifted to sleep with a smile on my face.

I almost tend to overcompensate with niceness and pleasing because thats how I am and because of the prior.  
I had such an overall nice experience at the mural festival I spent my time at, even chatting upto people there (more on it later).

But thats where it stops. Every other interaction I have had, people have been so rude even in some ridiculous situations when one would expect them to be thankful. A couple random interactions, I visited a boutique coffee shop quite early at 7 AM, I greet the barista,  
Me: bonjour - good morning! Can I have xyz coffee, sil vous plait? Also is the abc (brownie) fresh? If so I'll take one of it.   
Barista: (No good morning nothing) it is what it looks like, buy or dont buy. No refund if you dont like it.  
Me: (quite shocked). Okay I'll get it.

Another one was: I saw two girls walking opposite to me, with one of them limping with her foot clearly with a huge plastic plaster on. As we pass by each other, I simply nodded and said, Bonjour get well soon! And omg the look of disgust she threw at me, it made me feel so small and pathetic.

Finally, I saw a person struggling with their 3 huge ass luggages on the metro, very sure they wouldn't make the cut into the train without help. As the train arrived, I told her if she'd like me to help her take the luggage inside the metro, and she literally said dont touch them, and looked at me as if I was panhandling for money. As the train opened its door, people got out and people got in, and she was struggling with her bags, then she happily took up a white person's help who wasnt with her clearly. Such a weird metro ride with me and her in the same compartment.

Now coming back to what I felt was great at the mural festival, I rethought the events. And it kind of lines up, everyone I talked to at the mural festival was a minority.  
  
I am starting to feel more so that it is not the case that montreal (or most montreal folks) are not french proud, but rather a bit racist. I am not sure, but honestly left such a bitter taste visiting here.",0,1749358305.0,montreal,19,0.25,False

1l63wc6,https://youtu.be/s4EKoCNEjxY,3 Very Scary TRUE Park Ranger Help Horror Stories,"# ""Mist Trail, Red Jacket"":

I was a park ranger at Yosemite National Park, stationed near the trailhead of the Mist Trail that led to Vernal Fall. The day was busy, with hikers of all kinds—families, solo adventurers, and groups of friends—crowding the narrow paths, their chatter mixing with the distant roar of the falls. My job was to keep an eye on them, answer questions, and make sure they stayed safe in this wild, beautiful place. But no matter how much we prepared, some days reminded us that nature didn’t always let us win.I was checking my gear—first aid kit, water, rope, and radio—when the call came through. The radio on my hip hissed to life. ""Ranger 4, this is Dispatch. We’ve got a report of a missing hiker on the Mist Trail, near Vernal Fall. Family says a young man in a red jacket wandered off the path about an hour ago.""My stomach dropped. The Mist Trail was no joke. Steep, rocky, and slick from the mist of the falls, it was one of the most dangerous spots in the park. People slipped there every year, and not all of them walked away. ""Copy, Dispatch. Description of the hiker?""""Male, early twenties, short brown hair, red jacket, blue backpack. Last seen heading toward the fall’s overlook. Family’s waiting at the trailhead.""""Got it. I’m on my way."" I waved over Ranger Alex, who was helping a couple with a map nearby. ""Alex, we’ve got a missing hiker. Let’s go.""He nodded, his face serious, and grabbed his pack. We started up the trail, moving fast but careful. The path was packed with hikers, some struggling up the stone steps, others snapping photos of the river below. We weaved through them, our boots thudding against the uneven ground. A few people glanced at us, sensing the urgency, but most were too caught up in their own adventures to notice.The Mist Trail climbed sharply, and the closer we got to Vernal Fall, the louder the water roared. The air grew damp, the rocks underfoot glistening. I scanned the edges of the trail, looking for any sign of a red jacket or blue backpack. My mind raced. An hour was a long time out here. He could be anywhere—lost in the woods, stuck on a ledge, or worse.Halfway up, near a bend in the trail, a woman in a green hat waved us down. She looked shaken, her hands clutching a water bottle. ""Are you looking for that guy in the red jacket?"" she asked, her voice trembling.""Yeah,"" I said, catching my breath. ""Did you see him?""She nodded, pointing to a rocky outcrop just off the trail, where the ground sloped toward a steep drop. ""He was over there, climbing around. I saw him leave the path, said he wanted a better view of the fall. I told him it wasn’t safe, but he just laughed and kept going. I haven’t seen him since.""""How long ago was this?"" Alex asked, stepping closer.""About 45 minutes, maybe less,"" she said, her eyes darting to the outcrop. ""I should’ve done more, followed him or something.""""You warned him,"" I said, trying to ease her guilt, though I knew it wouldn’t help much. ""Stay here in case we need you. We’ll check it out.""We moved toward the outcrop, the roar of the fall now so loud it vibrated in my chest. The trail was busy, but beyond its edges, the terrain turned treacherous—jagged rocks, loose gravel, and a sheer drop to the Merced River below. I cupped my hands and shouted, ""Hello? Can you hear me?"" The only reply was the crash of water and the faint rustle of wind through the pines.I edged closer to the drop, my boots slipping slightly on the damp stone. The river churned below, white foam swirling around sharp rocks. My heart pounded as I leaned out, searching for any sign of him. ""Alex, you see anything?""He was scanning the other side of the outcrop, his face tense. ""Nothing yet. Let’s keep looking.""We spread out, moving carefully off the trail. The ground was uneven, littered with pine needles and small stones that shifted underfoot. I called out again, louder this time, but the fall’s roar swallowed my voice. Then, near the edge of a cliff, I froze. A scrap of red fabric was caught on a thorny bush, flapping faintly. I crouched and picked it up, my fingers brushing the rough material. It was part of a jacket, bright red, just like the one described.""Alex, over here!"" I held up the fabric, my voice tight.He jogged over, his eyes widening. ""That’s his, isn’t it?""""Looks like it."" I stuffed the fabric in my pocket and radioed Dispatch. ""Dispatch, this is Ranger 4. Found a piece of a red jacket off the Mist Trail, near Vernal Fall. Requesting search and rescue now.""""Copy, Ranger 4. SAR team is on the way. ETA 25 minutes.""Twenty-five minutes felt like forever. If he was hurt, or worse, every second mattered. We kept searching, checking behind boulders and along the cliff’s edge. I shouted his description to nearby hikers, asking if they’d seen him. Most shook their heads, but an older man with a walking stick paused.""I saw a kid in a red jacket,"" he said, pointing to a steep incline above the outcrop. ""He was climbing up there, near those loose rocks. Looked like he was trying to get closer to the fall. I thought he was crazy, but I didn’t say anything.""""When was this?"" I asked, my pulse quickening.""About an hour ago,"" he said, scratching his beard. ""Didn’t see him come back down.""I thanked him and turned to Alex. ""We need to check that incline, but we can’t go up without gear. It’s too unstable.""He nodded, his jaw tight. ""Let’s wait for SAR. We don’t need two emergencies.""We secured the area, moving hikers back and setting up cones to block the outcrop. The crowd grew curious, whispering among themselves. A teenage girl nearby asked, ""Is someone hurt?"" I didn’t answer, just shook my head and kept my eyes on the cliff.The wait was agonizing. The fall’s roar was relentless, and the air felt heavy, like the park itself was watching. I kept picturing that red fabric, torn and caught, and wondered what we’d find. My mind went to dark places—slipped on the rocks, fell into the river, trapped on a ledge. I’d seen accidents here before, but each one hit like it was the first.When the SAR team arrived, their heavy packs clinked with climbing gear. The team leader, Ben, approached us. ""What’s the situation?"" he asked, adjusting his helmet.""Missing hiker, male, early twenties, red jacket,"" I said, handing him the scrap of fabric. ""Last seen climbing near the fall. We found this on a bush by the cliff.""Ben’s face hardened. ""We’ll start at the base of the fall and work our way up. If he fell, the river’s the likely spot.""I nodded, but the thought made my chest tight. The Merced River was unforgiving, its current strong enough to pull a grown man under in seconds. Ben and his team set up their ropes, their movements precise despite the chaos around them. They descended over the edge, vanishing into the mist.We waited, keeping the crowd at a distance. A woman in the group, maybe the one who’d flagged us down, was crying now, her husband comforting her. ""He was so young,"" she said softly. I wanted to say something, but what could I say? We didn’t even know if he was alive.The minutes dragged. The fall’s roar filled the silence, broken only by the occasional squawk of my radio. I paced, my boots scuffing the dirt. Alex stood nearby, staring at the cliff, his hands clenched. ""You think he’s down there?"" he asked quietly.""I hope not,"" I said, but the words felt hollow.Finally, Ben’s voice crackled through. ""Ranger 4, we found him. He’s in the river, at the base of the fall. No pulse. Looks like he hit the rocks before the water got him.""The words hit like a punch. I swallowed hard. ""Copy that. Can you recover him?""""We’re trying,"" Ben said. ""The current’s strong, and the rocks are slick. It’s gonna take time.""I relayed the news to Alex, who just nodded, his face pale. We stayed put, helping the SAR team manage the crowd as they worked. Hikers kept asking questions, their voices a blur. ""What happened?"" ""Is he okay?"" I didn’t answer, just kept my focus on the ropes moving over the edge.When they finally brought him up, hours later, I saw him for the first time. He was young, his red jacket soaked and torn, his blue backpack still strapped to his shoulders. His body was battered—bruises on his face, one arm twisted at a sickening angle, blood matting his hair. The rocks had done their work before the river claimed him. I felt bile rise in my throat but forced it down. I’d seen death before, but the sight of him, so close to my own age, hit hard.We covered him with a tarp, shielding him from the crowd’s stares. A hiker nearby whispered, ""He was just trying to get a photo, wasn’t he?"" The words cut deep. One moment, one step too far, and he was gone.The SAR team carried him down the trail, a slow, somber procession. Alex and I followed, our steps heavy. The crowd parted for us, their faces a mix of shock and pity. I kept my eyes on the ground, avoiding their gazes. The fall’s roar faded as we descended, but it still echoed in my head.Back at the station, the paperwork waited—incident reports, witness statements, notifications to the family. I sat at my desk, pen in hand, but couldn’t write. All I could see was that red jacket, that twisted arm, those empty eyes. I kept hearing the woman’s voice: ""I should’ve done more."" I wondered if I could’ve moved faster, searched harder, done something to change the outcome.Later that night, I walked back to the trailhead alone. The falls were still there, crashing in the distance, their sound carrying through the dark. The park was stunning, but it was also cruel. It didn’t care about our rules, our plans, our lives. I was here to protect people, to guide them, but sometimes the land was too wild, too vast.I thought about his family, waiting for a call that would break their world apart. I thought about the hikers who’d seen him climb, who’d carry that memory forever. And I thought about us, the rangers, left to face the questions no one could answer. Why him? Why today? What could we have done?The river kept flowing, the falls kept roaring, and the park went on, untouched by the life it had taken. I stood there, staring into the shadows, knowing I’d carry this day with me. We’d tried, we’d run, we’d searched, but sometimes, no matter how hard we fought, we couldn’t help. And that truth, more than anything, was what kept me awake long after the falls went quiet.

  


# ""The Vanishing Ranger of Chiricahua"":

I’ve been a park ranger at Chiricahua National Monument for over a decade, and I thought I knew every inch of this place—its jagged hoodoos, balanced rocks teetering like they might fall any second, and canyons that twist so deep you feel like you’re walking into the earth’s bones. It’s beautiful, but it’s also wild, untamed in a way that makes you respect it. That respect turned to fear the day Paul Fugate, one of our best rangers, disappeared without a trace.It was January 13, 1980. Paul stopped by my office in the visitor center around 2 p.m., his green uniform pressed, badge glinting under the light. He had his radio clipped to his belt, a small notepad in his pocket, and his service firearm holstered at his hip. Paul was a naturalist through and through, the kind of guy who could name every plant and bird in the park and tell you their stories. He’d been a teacher before this, and you could hear it in the way he talked to visitors, patient and full of facts. “I’m heading out to check the trail to the south ridge,” he said, leaning against the doorframe, his boots scuffing the worn floor. “Shouldn’t take long. If I’m not back by 4:30, you can start closing up.” I glanced up from the stack of reports on my desk and gave him a nod. “Sounds good, Paul. See you in a bit.” He flashed a quick smile and walked out, his footsteps fading down the hall. I didn’t think twice about it. Paul knew these trails better than anyone. He’d hiked them in every season, mapped them in his head. He was the last person I’d worry about.By 4:30, the visitor center was quiet, just the hum of the heater and the occasional creak of the building. Paul hadn’t come back. I figured he might’ve stopped to check a washed-out section of trail or gotten caught up talking to a hiker. I grabbed my radio and pressed the button. “Paul, you there? Over.” Static crackled back, sharp and empty, like a door slamming shut. I tried again. “Paul, come in. You okay?” More static. My stomach twisted, a small knot of unease. The canyons could mess with radio signals, especially if he was deep in one. I waited another fifteen minutes, pacing the office, glancing at the clock. At 5:00, I called again. Nothing. That knot in my gut tightened. Something was wrong.I grabbed my jacket and radioed two other rangers, Tom and Ellen, who were finishing up at the maintenance shed. “Paul’s not back from the south ridge trail,” I said. “I’m heading out to look. Meet me at the trailhead.” They didn’t ask questions—just said they’d be there. We met up ten minutes later, our flashlights bobbing in the fading light. The trail started wide, gravel crunching under our boots, but it narrowed fast, winding through rock spires and into a canyon where the walls closed in tight. We called his name, our voices bouncing off the stone. “Paul! You out here?” The echoes came back, mocking us. No footprints, no dropped gear, no sign of him. The air felt heavy, like the park was holding its breath. We searched until it was too dark to see, our flashlight beams slicing through the shadows, catching nothing but rock and scrub. My heart was pounding, not just from the hike but from the growing sense that something was off—way off.The next morning, we organized a full search. Over a hundred people showed up—park staff, local police, volunteers from town, even some hikers who’d heard the news. Helicopters thumped overhead, their blades chopping the air, stirring up dust that stung my eyes. We brought in tracking dogs, their handlers guiding them along the trail. The dogs sniffed the ground, their noses twitching, but they’d stop and circle, whining like they’d lost the scent. The park was too big, too wild. Canyons branched off in every direction, some so narrow you had to turn sideways to pass. Crevices dropped into blackness, deep enough to swallow a man whole. I kept picturing Paul lying at the bottom of one, his leg broken, calling out where no one could hear. Or worse, not calling out at all.We split into teams, each taking a section of the park. My group worked the south ridge, checking every side trail, every overhang. The rocks were sharp, slicing at my gloves as I climbed. Every rustle in the brush made me jump, thinking it might be Paul—or something else. “He’s got to be here somewhere,” Tom said, his voice tight as we paused to catch our breath. He was young, barely a year on the job, and his eyes kept darting to the shadows. “He’s too smart to get lost.” Ellen, older and steadier, shook her head. “This place doesn’t care how smart you are,” she said. “You slip, you fall, you’re gone.” I didn’t say anything. I was too busy scanning the ground, hoping for a footprint, a scrap of green fabric, anything. But there was nothing. It was like Paul had stepped off the edge of the world.Days turned into weeks. The search grew bigger, then smaller as volunteers had to go back to their lives. The helicopters stopped coming. The dogs went home. We kept looking, though, us rangers, because Paul was one of ours. I’d walk the trails alone sometimes, calling his name until my throat was raw. The park started to feel different, like it was watching me. Shadows seemed to move just out of sight, and every snap of a twig made my hand twitch toward my radio. I’d tell myself it was just a coyote or a gust of wind, but the feeling wouldn’t shake.About a month later, I drove to Paul’s house to check on Dody, his wife. Their place was small, tucked at the edge of town, with a yard full of wildflowers Paul used to tend. Dody opened the door, her face pale, eyes red like she hadn’t slept in weeks. “Any news?” she asked before I could say hello. I shook my head, feeling like I’d failed her. “We’re still looking, Dody. Every day.” She nodded, her lips tight, and invited me in. We sat at her kitchen table, coffee cups steaming between us, untouched. “Paul would never just leave like that,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “He loved this park. Loved me. We were planning a trip, you know? After he retired. He wanted to see Yellowstone.” She looked at me, her eyes searching. “Something happened to him out there. I know it.” I wanted to argue, to say maybe he’d just gotten lost, but the words stuck in my throat. “We’ll keep looking,” I said again, uselessly. She nodded, staring at the table, and I left feeling heavier than when I’d arrived.Back at the park, rumors started to spread. The monument was close to the Mexican border, and some rangers whispered about drug smugglers using the trails at night. “Maybe Paul saw something he wasn’t supposed to,” Tom said one evening in the break room, his voice low like he didn’t want the walls to hear. “He had his gun, but that doesn’t mean much if he was outnumbered.” Ellen frowned, stirring her coffee. “Or maybe he just fell,” she said. “There’s a hundred places out there a man could disappear.” I didn’t like either idea. The thought of Paul running into trouble—someone making sure he’d never talk—made my skin crawl. But the idea of him lying broken at the bottom of a canyon wasn’t much better. Then there was the other theory, the one nobody wanted to say out loud: maybe Paul had walked away on purpose. Started a new life somewhere. It didn’t fit, though. He’d been happy, settled, talking about his future with Dody. Why would he leave everything behind?The search dragged on for months. We checked every trail, every cave, every dry wash. Divers even searched a few of the deeper springs, their lights glinting in the murky water. Nothing. Not a button from his uniform, not a scratch on a rock. The park was keeping him, and it wasn’t telling us where. I started to hate those canyons, the way they loomed over me, silent and smug. Every patrol felt like walking into a trap. I’d hear a rustle and spin around, half-expecting to see Paul standing there, or worse, someone else. The other rangers felt it too. Tom started carrying an extra knife, and Ellen stopped hiking alone. “This place is different now,” she told me once, her voice quiet. “Like it’s hiding something.”Years passed, but the case never closed. In 2018, the park service upped the reward to $60,000 for any information about Paul. A few leads trickled in. Someone found bones in a remote canyon, and my heart jumped, thinking we’d finally found him. But the tests came back negative—not Paul. Another person swore they’d seen a man matching his description in a town hundreds of miles away, years ago. We followed it up, but it led nowhere, just another dead end. The mystery hung over the park like a shadow, dark and heavy.Now, when we train new rangers, we tell them about Paul. It’s part of the job, a story we pass down like a warning. “Be careful out there,” we say, pointing to the canyons. “This place can be beautiful, but it can also be deadly.” I still walk the trails, but I’m not the same. Every step, I’m looking over my shoulder, wondering if Paul’s out there, hidden in some crevice we missed, or if someone made sure he’d never be found. Did he slip into a chasm, his body wedged where no one could reach? Did he cross paths with the wrong person, someone who knew those trails as well as he did? Or did he just… vanish, swallowed by the vastness of this place? I don’t know. All I know is we tried everything, and it wasn’t enough. The park keeps its secrets, and Paul’s one of them.

  


# ""Portage"":

I stood on the edge of Turnagain Arm, my boots sinking slightly into the soft ground, watching Adeana fiddle with the straps on her backpack. We’d been married two weeks, and this trip to the mudflats near Portage, Alaska, felt like our first real adventure as husband and wife. The air smelled of salt and earth, and the flats stretched out before us, a wide, gray expanse that looked solid, like a beach after a storm. We’d come to try gold dredging, chasing stories of flecks of gold hidden in the silt. Adeana turned to me, her brown hair tied back, her eyes bright with excitement. “Jay, you think we’ll find enough to buy that cabin?” she asked, her voice teasing.I grinned, hauling the dredge off the back of our four-wheeler. “Maybe just enough for a porch,” I said. “But we’ve gotta start somewhere.” She laughed, the sound light and warm, and helped me drag the equipment toward a spot we’d picked out, about a hundred yards from the water’s edge. The four-wheeler’s tires crunched over the ground, and I kept an eye on the tide line in the distance. I’d read about Turnagain Arm, how the tides here could rush in faster than a man could run, but the water looked far off, and we had time. Or so I thought.We set up the dredge, a heavy, clunky machine with a hose and a pump to suck up mud and sift it for gold. Adeana knelt beside it, her hands already smudged with gray silt. “This thing looks like it’s from the Stone Age,” she said, tugging at the hose. “You sure it works?”“Guy at the shop swore by it,” I said, checking the fuel in the pump. “Just don’t let it suck up your boots.” She stuck out her tongue, and we got to work, the dredge humming as it pulled up wet clumps of earth. The mud was cold, sticking to our gloves, and I kept glancing at the water, still a safe distance away. “Keep an eye out, okay?” I said. “Tide’s sneaky here.”“Got it, boss,” Adeana said, mock-saluting. She was in her element, digging into the mud, her enthusiasm pulling me along. For a while, it felt perfect—us, the open flats, the dream of finding something valuable together.Then the four-wheeler got stuck. I’d driven it a little closer to reposition the dredge, but when I hit the throttle to move it back, the tires spun, sinking deeper into the mud. “Come on,” I muttered, revving the engine. The wheels whined, spitting mud, but didn’t budge. Adeana hopped off, her boots squelching. “Jay, it’s really stuck,” she said, pushing against the handlebars. “This mud’s like cement.”I climbed off, my stomach tightening. The ground felt different now, softer, like it was waiting to grab us. I pushed with her, my boots sinking an inch with every step. “We’ll leave it,” I said, wiping sweat from my forehead. “Let’s grab the gear and head back to solid ground.” I turned to pick up the dredge, but Adeana’s voice stopped me cold.“Jay, I can’t move my foot.” She was standing a few feet away, one leg buried to the ankle. Her face was pale, her eyes wide. “It’s stuck. Like, really stuck.”I dropped the hose and ran to her, my heart thudding. “Okay, don’t panic,” I said, kneeling beside her. The mud around her boot was smooth and wet, but when I tried to dig with my hands, it was like scooping wet concrete. It clung to my fingers, heavy and cold. “Pull,” I said, gripping her leg. She tugged, her face twisting with effort, but her foot didn’t move.“It’s not coming out,” she said, her voice sharp with fear. “Jay, it’s tight, like it’s squeezing me.” She yanked harder, her other foot sinking a little as she shifted her weight. I grabbed a shovel from the four-wheeler, my hands shaking, and started digging around her leg. The mud was stubborn, filling back in almost as fast as I scooped it out.“Keep trying to wiggle it,” I said, my voice tighter than I wanted. I glanced at the water. It was closer now, maybe seventy yards, a gray line creeping toward us. My chest felt like it was being squeezed. “I’m gonna get you out,” I said, more to convince myself than her.Adeana forced a small smile, but her eyes kept darting to the tide. “Hurry, okay? This feels wrong.” Her voice was soft, almost a whisper. I dug faster, the shovel scraping against the mud, but it wasn’t enough. The ground seemed to tighten around her, pulling her deeper. Her other foot was starting to sink now, the mud creeping up to her shins.I dropped the shovel and ran to the dredge, my boots slipping. “I’m gonna try the hose,” I said, dragging it over. The machine was still running, its motor loud in my ears. I aimed the suction hose at the mud around her leg, hoping it could pull enough away to free her. The dredge groaned, sucking up clumps of silt, but the mud held tight, like it was alive and refusing to let go.“Jay, the water’s getting closer,” Adeana said, her voice shaking. I looked up. The tide was maybe fifty yards away now, moving faster, a relentless wall of gray. Her legs were stuck to the knees, and she was shivering, her hands clutching my arm. “I’m scared, Jay. It’s so cold.”“Don’t look at the water,” I said, my throat burning. “Look at me. I’m getting you out.” I worked the dredge, my hands numb from the cold mud, but it wasn’t enough. The tide was closing in, forty yards now, the water lapping at the edges of the flats. I grabbed the radio from the four-wheeler, my fingers fumbling with the buttons. “Mayday, mayday!” I shouted. “We’re on Turnagain Arm, near Portage. My wife’s stuck in the mud. The tide’s coming in. We need help now!”The voice on the other end was calm, maddeningly calm. “Sir, we’ve got your location. Troopers and paramedics are on the way. ETA fifteen to twenty minutes.”“Fifteen minutes?” I yelled, my voice cracking. “The water’s almost here!” I dropped the radio and went back to the dredge, my hands slipping on the hose. The water was at thirty yards, swirling around the edges of the mud. Adeana’s breathing was fast, her face white. “Jay, I can’t feel my feet,” she said, her teeth chattering. “It’s too cold.”“Hold on,” I said, my voice breaking. “Talk to me, Adeana. Tell me about that cabin we’re gonna build.” I was desperate to keep her focused, to keep myself from falling apart.She swallowed hard, her eyes locked on mine. “Big porch,” she said, her voice trembling. “For sunsets. A garden out back. Room for a dog… maybe two.” She tried to smile, but the water was at her feet now, cold and gray, creeping up her legs. “Jay, it’s rising fast.”I heard shouts in the distance. Two figures were sprinting toward us, their gear bouncing. A man and a woman, one in a trooper’s uniform, the other with a paramedic’s bag. “We’re here!” the man called, his voice cutting through the hum of the dredge. He was tall, his radio crackling as he dropped beside me. “I’m Trooper Opalka. We’re gonna get you out, ma’am.”“Hurry!” I shouted, my hands raw from working the hose. The water was at Adeana’s thighs now, moving faster, like it was alive. The paramedic, a woman with short hair, waded in, tying a rope around Adeana’s waist. “We’ve got you,” she said, her voice steady, but I saw her glance at the water, her eyes tight with worry.Opalka dug with his hands, the mud sticking to his gloves. “This stuff’s like concrete,” he muttered, scooping frantically. The paramedic pulled on the rope, but Adeana didn’t budge. “It’s not working,” I said, my voice hoarse. The water was at her waist, cold and relentless. Adeana was shaking, her lips blue. “Jay, I can’t move,” she whispered. “I’m so cold.”“Pull harder!” I shouted, grabbing the rope with the paramedic. We yanked, but the mud held tight, like it was swallowing her. The water climbed to her chest, and Adeana tilted her head back, gasping to keep her face above it. “Jay,” she said, her voice barely audible. “I love you.”The tide surged, covering her shoulders. I screamed, grabbing her hands, her fingers icy and slipping in mine. “Adeana, hold on!” I yelled, pulling with everything I had. Opalka grabbed my arm, his face grim. “We can’t stay here,” he said, his voice low. “The water’s too high. It’ll take us all.”“No!” I fought him, my legs buckling as the water reached Adeana’s chin. Her eyes were wide, full of fear, locked on mine. “Jay,” she whispered, and then the water closed over her face. I lunged forward, but Opalka and the paramedic dragged me back, the tide rushing in, covering her completely.I collapsed on higher ground, my chest heaving, staring at the water where she’d been. The rescuers stayed, their faces pale, wading in the cold, waiting for the tide to go out. Hours later, they found her, still trapped in the mud, her body still, her eyes closed. I fell to my knees, the world blurring, the sound of the waves deafening.They tried. The troopers, the paramedics—they did everything they could. But the mud and the tide were stronger. I keep replaying it, the way the flats looked so harmless, the way Adeana’s voice sounded when she said she was scared. I see her face every night, wondering if I could’ve dug faster, called sooner. Those flats took her from me, and no one could stop it.",1,1749357818.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1l63w8c,https://i.redd.it/wui7k9jwum5f1.jpeg,hba1c went from 5.9 to 5.0 in just 1 month and 2 weeks. Not sure if my diet changes are working or the previous result was a fluke,"My hba1c last year was 5.0, I then re tested 1 and a half month ago at 5.9. That result freaked me out because before I was never aware that I may even be prediabetic/diabetic, I only ordered the tests out of curiosity.

Right after that, I immediately went into calorie deficit (average daily intake 1500~1600 calories).  
At that time, I weighed 67kg at 167cm, somewhere about 22% body fat estimate. I’m not big so this deficit was pretty huge for me. I also started resistance training at the gym about 3 to 4 times a week. I also started running 6km once every 10 days.

At the first 3 weeks, I dropped all carbs mainly rice (Im asian). If I remember it right my total daily carb never exceeded 75g. On most days, I tried to keep it under 20g even.

With that diet I noticed that my energy levels were low. I felt weak when working out. I got a glucometer around this time and experimented a bit. I found that when eating proper asian rice meals (~70 carbs), my glucose would spike to 130~145 mg/dl after hour 1 but immeditely go down to 110s by hour 2, and then back to 90s at 2 hours and 30 mins. I knew 145 was high but I saw that it was able to go back down. With that finding, I re-encorporated rice back to my diet. I started to eat about 250~300g of rice daily, which was huge btw.

One time I ate 3 pcs snickers mini bar (3 x 18g each) just to experiment. My pre meal glucose was 86 mg/dl. I was shocked to find out that my glucose spiked to 164 mg/dl after 1 hour. I haven’t checked again at 1 hr 15 mins so who knows how high it spiked.

Fast forward to 1~2 weeks before my latest hba1c. By this time, I’ve already lost 3kg, and got a little bit of muscle definition (although I think I’m stilll skinny fat). Lately I’ve been binging on sweets, although I still try to keep it below 2000 total daily calories. One time I ate 1pc of coffee boston kreme dunkin donut (it was really sweet) and a home made iced coffee with 30g neslte coffee mate creamer (creamer was 17g carbs), after 1 hour my glucose was at 106 mg/dl only.

On few separate occassions, I enjoyed venti iced starbucks white chocolate mocha (very sweet) and would only be at 110s or below by 1 hour mark. Most of my morning glucose is also at 80s to low 90s so that’s great.

Right after all that, I retested a few days ago and got 5.05 hba1c. I was very shocked. I did this test so close to the last one (5.9) because in the back of my mind I had some doubts about the 5.9 result. But on the other hand, for an entire year my diet leading to the 5.9 result was a very shitty one (pizza, cake, fastfood, sweets, late night 2 AM heavy meals, large servings of starbucks iced cofee, all with no serving restriction basically eating anything all the time) so that may be why.

Nowadays, I usually eat whatever I want, but still try to be equal to or below my maintenance calories. I still want to lose the excess belly fat that I have, but I’m still in a healthy bmi range though. Moving forward, I’m going to workout more seriously now, although I have to admit I’m still going to indulge in sweets on few occasions (they’re kinda hard for me to totally elliminate)

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal under cabinet power strip offers a blend of functionality, safety, and aesthetics. Here's a breakdown of the critical features to consider:

**Outlet and USB Port Configuration:**

The Number and type of outlets and USB ports are crucial. Look for models with a sufficient quantity of standard AC outlets (120V) to power appliances like blenders, coffee makers, or power tools. The inclusion of USB-A and USB-C ports for charging mobile devices is also highly beneficial. Consider the amperage offered by the USB ports for faster charging. Power strip should have minimum of 3 AC outlets and 2 USB ports (A and C).

**Integrated Lighting:**

many under cabinet power strips come equipped with integrated LED lighting. This provides task lighting for countertops or work surfaces. Look for models with adjustable brightness levels and color temperatures to customize the lighting to your preference. Led brightness levels should have at least 3 different settings.

**Mounting Options and Ease of Installation:**

The ease of installation can vary significantly between models. Some use adhesive strips, while others require screws or brackets.Choose a mounting system that is appropriate for your cabinet material and skill level. Consider the sturdiness of the mounting system to ensure the power strip stays securely in place.**Safety Features:**

Safety is paramount when dealing with electrical devices. Look for power strips with built-in surge protection to protect your electronics from voltage spikes. Overload protection, indicated by a circuit breaker, is also essential to prevent overheating. A UL or ETL listing indicates the product has been tested and meets safety standards.

**Cord Length and Placement:**

The Length and placement of the power cord is an critically important consideration. Ensure the cord is long enough to reach a nearby outlet without being too long and creating a tripping hazard. Consider whether the cord exits from the side, back, or bottom of the power strip and choose a placement that works best for your installation.

**Material and Design:**

The Material and design should be durable and aesthetically pleasing. Look for power strips made from high-quality materials such as aluminum or sturdy plastic. The design should blend seamlessly with your cabinets and décor. Consider whether you prefer a sleek, minimalist look or a more customary design.

key features of a good under cabinet power strip include:

* Ample outlet and USB port selection
* Integrated lighting with adjustable settings
* Easy and secure mounting options
* Robust safety features like surge protection
* Sufficient cord length and convenient placement

## Core Benefits

Under cabinet power strips provide several key benefits, significantly improving the functionality and organization of your space.

**Increased Countertop Space:** By relocating outlets under the cabinet, you free up valuable countertop space that would otherwise be occupied by bulky power strips. This allows for a cleaner, more organized workspace.

**Improved Accessibility:** Under cabinet power strips provide easy access to outlets and USB ports right where you need them, without the need to reach behind appliances or crawl under desks. This is especially convenient for frequently used devices.

**Enhanced Organization:** These power strips help to eliminate tangled cords and clutter on your countertops. This creates a more visually appealing and functional space.

**Added Convenience:** Integrated lighting provides task lighting exactly where it's needed, improving visibility for cooking, crafting, or working. Adjustable brightness and color temperature settings allow you to customize the lighting to your specific needs.

**Greater Safety:** Surge protection and overload protection safeguards your valuable electronics from damage caused by power surges and overloads. A UL or ETL listing provides assurance that the product meets safety standards.

## FAQs Section

**What is the typical lifespan of an under cabinet power strip?**
The lifespan of an under cabinet power strip varies depending on the quality of the materials and the frequency of use. However, most high-quality power strips should last for 5-7 years with proper care. Regularly inspect the power strip for signs of wear and tear, such as frayed cords or damaged outlets.

**Can I daisy-chain under cabinet power strips together?**
It is generally not recommended to daisy-chain power strips together. This can overload the circuit and create a fire hazard. Instead,use a single power strip with enough outlets and USB ports to meet your needs.

**Are under cabinet power strips waterproof or water-resistant?**
Most under cabinet power strips are not waterproof or water-resistant. It is important to keep them away from water and other liquids to prevent electrical shock or damage to the power strip.If you need a power strip for a damp environment, look for one that is specifically designed for that purpose.

**How do I clean an under cabinet power strip?**
To clean an under cabinet power strip, first disconnect it from the power outlet. Then, use a soft, dry cloth to wipe away any dust or dirt. Avoid using water or cleaning solutions,as these can damage the electrical components.

1l63t7k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l63t7k,Day 34 of 40,"I am on day 34 of what will be my longest fast, 40 days. I beat my PR of 21 days (last year) and am fully resolved/not worried in the slightest that I’ll finish out the whole thing. I am down 45.8lbs so far.

May 5-281.2lbs
June 7-235.4lbs

To give some background, I played college football as a defensive lineman at a D1 SEC program, and during that time got to 295lbs at my largest (definitely dirty bulked). I have also been in the Marine Corps Reserve since before that time, and having to juggle that and Marine Corps height/weight standards led me to learn a ton about keto, then carnivore, then fasting (intermittent then prolonged). For the last few years I’ve done weekly 24-48s, monthly 72-96s, and a handful of prolonged (7, 21, & 16 day fasts).

Admittedly, I’ve not done a great job living well in between those long fasts, partying and living it up too much, and at the end of April, after coming back from a work trip, decided to do the pinnacle of fasting (in my opinion), the full 40, and get myself back to where I want to be and stop going hard in the paint in terms of living it up and being unhealthy afterwards.

I am hoping to get into the 220s by the time I’m done, and then live 80/20 healthy/fun afterwards and keep on a losing trajectory until I’m ~10% bodyfat. 

As for how this fast is going, I feel about 80% of normal, and have been regularly consuming electrolytes and some mineral supplements. I work out every other or third day, just basically going through the motions, but walk or do other light activities every day. I have been consuming water, sparkling water, black coffee, electrolyte packets (or zero calorie Gatorades if I’m on the road), have had plenty of diet soda, and I am a regular Zynner. Yes, I know this makes it not a pure waster fast, but they’re making this a no-sweat endeavor for me, so I’ll take that hit. 

Anyway, posting this if anyone has any questions or if anyone needs some inspiration! Live faster! ",175,1749357487.0,fasting,43,0.99,False

1l63qcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/amex/comments/1l63qcc/sharing_my_experience_after_1_year_with_amex_gold/,Sharing my experience after 1 year with Amex Gold and Platinum,"TLDR: I was fortunate to get the 90k SUB for Gold and 175k for Platinum, applying and getting approved for both on the same day. Additionally, I got about $3k worth of value back after paying the $250 (last yr) + $695 AFs (benefits only, excluding cash back on purchases), so for me it has been totally worth it.

I'd like to begin by touting the Amex Platinum card because it seems to fit my lifestyle perfectly. We don't travel much, but the annual hotel and airline credits have suited our travel needs by covering one night, checked bags, and Wi-Fi. We already order with Uber Eats a couple times per month when we don't feel like cooking. We also had Walmart+, Paramount+ and Disney+ for the family so it's been great to have all these for free now w/ Uber + streamung credits totaling $588 of the 695 AF. We also get a Saks gift card every 6 months which can buy a couple of the kid's outfits from Off Saks thanks to their generous promos and discounts. There have been some pretty nice offers over the past 12 months too, like a $90 Delta credit and $15-$30 each for car insurance, Peet's coffee and Blue Apron + Gren Chef that we enjoy.

The killer value though is the Amex Platinum benefits for FHR. We used the 330k points amassed from SUBs and purchases toward a week-long stay at a 5-star Hawaiian resort for our wedding. The Platinum benefit included free brunch at $130 per day for 7 days plus the $100 resort credit. Absolutely wild!

As for Gold, we use this one exclusively for all of our groceries and dining. Along with the additional Uber Eats credits, we used the bi-annual Resi credit and monthly dining credits along with many low, medium, and high-end restaurant offers. The killer app here IMO is the free companion card. My wife and I doubled up on pretty much all of the dining, gas, and other offers. Sometimes you will find a Resi restaurant offer that can be combined with the $50 Resi credit. We just split the check at dinner and each get the offer which is outstanding.

Overall, I've been pretty stoked with my experience after the first year and added the Amex Platinum CS for 1.1x brokerage redemption and the BCP for 6x on groceries, no AF and $200 SUB. I'm totally an Amex addict now lol.",8,1749357190.0,amex,0,0.83,False

I’ve seen it change and not for the better. What’s happening here is violent displacement, masked as “development.” Gentrification is gutting this city. Family homes are being lost to inflated property taxes, replaced by cheaply built, soulless “modern” units renting for $3,000 and up. Developers are cashing in while entire communities are being erased.

Jersey City has always been a walkable, vibrant, real city built by working-class families, immigrants, artists, and everyday people. But the culture that made this place special is being pushed out to make room for high-rises full of people who have no connection to it.

New Yorkers moved here for “cheaper” rent, then drove up prices and now call it “basically Brooklyn.” Entire blocks are being gentrified beyond recognition with a bunch overpriced coffee shops, run clubs, and tone-deaf architecture sitting right next to the homes of people still trying to hold on.

This is not just about change. it’s about erasure. Jersey City isn’t dying. It’s being killed. and I am sick of it. 

It’s hitting my neighborhood directly. Bayfront is in development. The old Kmart on 440 is becoming a Target. They’re extending the Light Rail to Route 440 and even planning ferry service to Newark Airport. These aren’t improvements they’re warning signs. I’m watching my neighborhood be packaged and sold off, block by block, to people who don’t care about the history here. just the convenience.",0,1749356735.0,jerseycity,93,0.41,False

1l63ler,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1l63ler/morning_sunshine_but_wout_the_temp_disregulation/,Morning Sunshine - But w/out the Temp Disregulation?,"I want to adopt the recommended morning routine of spending 5-10 minutes in the sunshine first thing every morning. It's supposed to help with mood, energy, circadian rhythm, all the things. But I'm stuck when it comes to how much my body struggles with temp regulation, and how deeply exhausting shivering is for me.  Have you tried this morning sun thing? **Do you have any recommendations for romanticizing the practice of being outdoors for the first 10 minutes of your morning, and making it feel good instead of feel cold and exhausting?**  
  
Considered:   
\- Big fluffy robe   
\- Ceramic coffee cup for outside so that it warms my hands while I sip   
\- Buying some Uggs, so they're warm and fuzzy and keep ankles covered   
\- Doing full shower and getting dressed routine and going outside between meetings later in the morning. I don't have the sense that this provides the same kind of benefit, though?

Am I overthinking? Missing anything genius? Going about it all wrong?",3,1749356683.0,POTS,0,1.0,False
1l63kwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1l63kwn/wits_end/,Wits end,"I’m at my wits end and I’m not sure what to do.

Canadian - Vancouver island 

I’ve lived with eczema my whole life. Over 40 years. It was terrible as a kid and varied throughout my life. I spent ten years in Toronto and it was ok there, pretty decent. I moved back the west coast in 2020 and it’s been steadily getting worse since then. 

Now it’s pretty much my whole body and it is red and dry and inflamed and horribly itchy it’s awful. I’ve broken down in tears more times than I can count. I could bathe in clobetasol and while it works it immediately returns. I use bleach baths, aveeno baths, bioderma or Laroche Posay body cream, aquaphor to lock it all in. Protopic for the face, and a liquid solution steroid cream I can’t remember the name of for more “sensitive” areas. 

I tried UV therapy and it did not go well, if anything it’s made it worse

I have asthma (controlled) and many food and environmental allergies. 

I went from a sterile condo in the sky to an old house built in 1970 surrounded by cedar trees and nature oh and also a small poodle cross dog. 

I’m waiting on dupixent approval but pacific blue cross is my benefit provider and apparently they do not usually approve it for eczema. 

I don’t know what else to do. I’m over it. I’m losing my god damn mind 

I barely drink alcohol, maybe one night a week I’ll have a beer or two. I don’t eat fast food, I don’t even eat at restaurants period. I work in construction so I’m moderately active but I could probably lose a couple lbs. I drink lots of water, no pop, coffee in the morning. 

There is obviously something major going on but I honestly don’t even have the mental energy to narrow it down anymore. What do I do? Live off rice and chicken broth for a month and see if that helps? Go for a swim in the ocean every day and come out in tears from the pain?

I guess I need to do an elimination diet but I just can’t bring myself to start. ",3,1749356636.0,eczema,2,0.81,False
1l63kom,https://i.redd.it/smve2duarm5f1.jpeg,Y’all are the best,"Thank you guys for the recommendations! 🤩 I just got my first nespresso I absolutely love it already! It was also such a great value! 
Now I’m just wondering which pods to order with my $10 off coupon 😆 could you guys recommend the best pods?? I would also like to mention I enjoy iced coffee. 
Also are there any good offers or coupons for the pods?? 
And which accessories are a must?? 
Thank youuuuuu !! 🤩🤩",10,1749356611.0,nespresso,2,0.92,False
1l63iee,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1l63iee/ever_wondered_what_people_are_talking_about_right/,Ever wondered what people are talking about right now in a specific location?,"Like seriously—have you ever been curious about what people are discussing in Indiranagar, NYC, or some random village in Italy right now?

Not big news or trending topics, but like…

“Is that new coffee shop in the corner actually good?”

“Why is there so much traffic on 4th street today?”

“Anyone else hear that weird noise last night?”

“Local protest near the park — what's going on?”


Imagine being able to just drop in to a real-time chat room that's specific to a district, neighborhood, or even a street — and hear from people actually there. Like a live Reddit mixed with a hyperlocal WhatsApp group.

Would you use something like that? Or is it too chaotic?",1,1749356382.0,AskIndia,1,1.0,False

Here is the thing Suzy...when you start to poke your nose in to things that are not your business, when you start to criticise other peoples lives, dont cry when the same is done to you.  I dont care what you say about Reese, Im no fan oh hers but you also involved yourself in the attempted take down of the good people at the aftermath fundation, they did not deserve that. You have aligned yourself with awful people who have hateful agendas and that is why your life and your actions have been under scrutiny.

I dont not think you are a good person Suzy,  I think you have lied, and manipulated the truth and sadfished to deflect. I think you can dish out the dirt, but you cannot handle it being served to you.

I hope in life, you get what you deserve.",4,1749356309.0,OT42,0,0.83,False
1l63hbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/1l63hbd/diagnostic_score_490_where_do_i_go_from_here/,Diagnostic Score = 490… Where do I go from here?,"As the title says, I just took my diagnostic today and scored a 490 (123 CP, 122 CARS, 121 BB, 124 P/S). I’ll be honest. I didn’t fully apply myself during the exam. I guessed on about half of CP, CARS, and P/S because I had a really hard time focusing due coffee shop noise and tiktok :(. That said, I’m shocked the BB section score because I felt completely lost there.

Now I’m just feeling stuck. I started UWorld today and plan to take the MCAT in September, but I’m not sure if that’s realistic or if I should push it back. Reading the content books has been so hard as I get overwhelmed and lost quickly. I’m really aiming high (yes, maybe overshooting), but I want a 526+. I know it’s not easy, but I’m committed to putting in the work to hopefully take it once and be done. For context, I plan to study 5–6 hours a day on weekdays and 20–24 hours total over the weekends. I usually struggle to understand things at first, but once it clicks, it sticks.

So I’m asking:
How should I approach studying from here?
What helped you review content effectively?
Any tips for staying focused or pushing through content that feels impossible?
Should I consider moving my test date?

Please, no negative or discouraging comments. I’m already beating myself up. Just looking for honest, helpful advice to keep moving forward.",2,1749356269.0,Mcat,7,0.67,False
