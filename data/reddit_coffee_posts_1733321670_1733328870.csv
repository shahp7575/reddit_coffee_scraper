I currently have a Dell laptop with a i7-8850H. I do a lot of local work (analyzing lots of traffic in Wireshark, many tabs open in Chrome, PHP Storm etc). For a while I was eyeing the FrameWork 16 with a Ryzen 7940HS however lots of comments from users on [https://www.reddit.com/r/framework/](https://www.reddit.com/r/framework/) about issues made me nervous and I am leaning towards Lenovo. What I care about the most in order of priority is.

1. High CPU power per core (ideally AMD).
2. Accidental warranty
3. Battery life (though most of the time I am plugged in).
4. Lots of ram (ideally 128, right now I have 64GB).
5. More than one disk if possible.
6. I prefer no GPU at all since it I don't do any gaming or graphics work and I prefer less of a load on my power draw. Ideally I would like a system that can charge on a 100 watt USB-C connection.

I plan on using Linux only (Ubuntu). Any recommendations on a hardware vendor that has good warranty should I spill coffee or the laptop taking a tumble (both happened in the past and Dell was great at getting it fixed).",1,1733328462.0,sysadmin,0,1.0,False

Sometimes, life feels like an endless loop of routines, responsibilities, and noise. Between the hustle of work and the daily distractions of modern life, it can be hard to feel connected—to yourself, to others, or to something larger than you. But what if those sacred, meaningful moments you're searching for aren't as rare as you think? What if, instead of seeking them somewhere far away, you could discover them right in the middle of your everyday life?

# What Are Sacred Moments in Life?

https://preview.redd.it/r3qcj2guuu4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cc50dff429853e166693e06b369a219cfce3b7a

At its core, a sacred moment is an experience that connects you to something greater than yourself. It might fill you with a sense of wonder, [serenity](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-serenity-of-cultivating-a-mindset-of-being/), or profound gratitude. Sacred moments have no strict rules or definitions; they don't only occur during religious rituals or grand milestones in life. Instead, they can arise unexpectedly, often in quiet, ordinary, and unassuming ways.

For some, a sacred moment is watching a glowing sunset dip below the horizon. For others, it's the smile of a loved one, the scent of fresh rainfall, or a quiet, reflective pause after morning coffee. These moments are special not because they are inherently extraordinary, but because they invite you to slow down, be fully present, and feel deeply connected—whether that's to nature, other people, or yourself.

# What Makes a Moment Sacred?

https://preview.redd.it/uu58arbwuu4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2261787c84b8352a166fd2fe6e7aac1449a6057

* **Presence:** You experience the fullness of a moment when you’re truly present in it, without distraction. Sacredness thrives in [mindfulness](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/10-acts-of-mindfulness-to-promote-better-health/).
* **Emotion:** Sacred moments often evoke strong emotions, like awe, peace, love, or gratitude.
* **Connection:** Whether it's with another person, nature, God, or a sense of purpose, what makes these moments sacred is the feeling of connection.
* **Perspective:** A sacred moment often causes a subtle but pivotal shift in perspective. It makes you pause, reflect, and feel humbled by its beauty or significance.

Sacred moments don’t have to conform to a religious framework, although they might for some individuals. They’re about meaning, joy, and [appreciation](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-best-kind-of-thanks/) in whatever way feels significant to you.

# How Do You Find the Sacred in Everyday Life?

Finding sacredness in daily life doesn’t require elaborate rituals or exotic travels. You only need a willingness to look at the world differently and an openness to slow down. Here’s how you can discover sacred moments in your everyday experiences.

**1. Practice Mindful Awareness**

Sacredness often hides in plain sight, waiting for you to notice. Start by practicing mindful awareness. Pay attention to the present moment without judgment. How does your breakfast taste? What do you hear as you sit quietly? What textures or patterns can you see?

Mindfulness pulls your focus away from distractions, like screens and stress, and redirects it toward the simple joys that you might otherwise overlook. Even something as seemingly mundane as the sound of boiling water can take on a peaceful, almost [meditative quality](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/a-beautiful-mind-and-life-with-meditation/) when approached mindfully.

***Try this*****:** Take five minutes every morning to sit somewhere quiet and observe what’s around you. Breathe deeply, and notice the small but beautiful details that might normally escape you.

**2. Create Rituals in Routine**

https://preview.redd.it/layk2ihzuu4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=6301f0b06fa0d2c2bfd8c8a3636c27664fa35058

Rituals don't have to be formal or religious to bring meaning to your life. They can be as simple as a morning walk, brewing tea, or journaling before bed. By adding purpose and mindfulness to these actions, you transform them from ""just another task"" into something grounding and meaningful.

Take, for example, preparing coffee. Instead of rushing through the process, focus on the steps involved—the aroma of the beans, the warmth of the mug in your hand. When done thoughtfully, this [small ritual](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/cultivating-your-rhythm-in-life-for-balance-and-harmony/) becomes an anchor for your day and invites a sacred stillness into your routine.

***Try this*****:** Start small. Identify one part of your day (like washing the dishes or walking to work) that can become a calming, meditative ritual.

**3. Connect with Nature**

https://preview.redd.it/7x4nx0m1vu4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=70efb4a0c96a30946898c8a020e08330992bd0b9

Nature has a way of reminding us of our place in the greater scheme of things. [Spending time outdoors](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-value-of-spending-time-in-nature/)—whether it's a hike, sitting under a tree, or stargazing—can help you feel grounded, inspired, and deeply connected to the world around you.

Sacredness happens in the still moments you share with nature, like listening to the rustle of leaves or watching the way sunlight dances off water.

***Try this*****:** Commit to spending at least 10 minutes outside every day. Leave your phone behind, take a few deep breaths, and immerse yourself in the sounds, textures, and smells of the natural world.

**4. Cultivate Gratitude**

Gratitude turns ordinary moments into extraordinary ones. When you shift your perspective to focus on the blessings in your life—no matter how small—you begin to see sacredness everywhere.

Start a [daily gratitude](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/7-life-hacks-to-cultivate-gratitude-every-day/) practice by thinking of three things you’re thankful for. These could be as simple as a delicious meal, a friend's humor, or a good book. Over time, you'll naturally notice more reasons to feel grateful throughout your day.

***Try this*****:** Each day, take a moment to let someone special in your life know how much you value and appreciate them.

**5. Connect with Others**

Sacred moments often occur during meaningful connections with others. It could be laughing with friends, having an honest conversation, or hugging a loved one after a long day. These shared experiences remind us of the importance of [relationships](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-winning-secret-to-successful-relationships/) and the value of companionship.

Dedicate time to nurturing your relationships. Be fully present when you're with someone—put away your phone and listen intently. Your undivided attention turns ordinary interactions into memorable, sacred exchanges.

***Try this*****:** Plan ""tech-free"" time with a loved one where you can truly focus on each other without distractions.

**6. Pause for Reflection**

https://preview.redd.it/q28ebu94vu4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=aed3e32a5e884237760231e0999723a8f91781f4

Often, sacred moments go unnoticed because we don’t take the time to [reflect](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/positive-thinking/) on them. Set aside a few minutes daily to reflect on your experiences. Were there moments today when you felt at peace or moved? How did these moments impact you?

Reflection quiets the noise of daily life and allows you to truly appreciate what’s already there.

***Try this*****:** At the end of the day, think back and identify a moment that felt meaningful to you. Reliving these moments will deepen their significance.

I consider myself fairly experienced with coffee and have high-quality equipment to work with. For context, my go-to recipe is a simple Switch V60: 15g coffee, 250g water, bloom with 45g, then brew with the switch closed for about 1:30 before opening.

When I opened the bag, I was immediately disappointed. The beans looked medium roasted, which isn’t ideal for a Gesha, as I usually expect something lighter. Despite my reservations, I gave it a shot and experimented a lot: I tried lowering the water temperature (down to 87°C) and adjusted other variables, but nothing seemed to work. The coffee lacked the tea-like characteristics, peach notes, and overall sweetness I expected.

Hating the sensitivity of my fingers after I cut my nails

Sticking to THE RULES even if they inconvenience me

This proves I shouldn't play SnowRunner while tired.

For full context, I'm in Kola and I'm doing the mission Inclement Weather, where I have to get a box near a crashed helicopter in a valley. First I sent out my Fleetstar F2070A with a flatbed and mini-crane, and I approached from the north. Realizing the box was *south* of the heli, I tried driving over the rocks to the west (camera-left). I maneuvered into position, but the mini-crane was unable to hoist the box. I *think* I may have even forgotten to deploy the crane's anchor. Either way, I tried forcing it (stupid I know), and my Fleetstar tipped over and fell *on* the cargo box, hence the little up-arrow icon *under* the truck.

I had my FEMM 37-AT in the area and figured, if I approach from the south, I can latch onto my Fleetstar and try to drag it upside-down just to get it out of the way, then re-flip it, then get the box. But I mis-maneuvered (seriously, I shouldn't play this game while tired) and wound up flipping the FEMM onto its side because I tried climbing the bigger set of rocks. I legit don't remember what I was thinking for that, but I was so annoyed at myself that I went to bed.

Now it's the next morning and I'm more clear-headed to give the game another shot. I made a post a week ago or so where, long story short, you guys helped me out and taught me that if I simply recover the Fleetstar, the cargo box will probably disappear. I know that in theory this isn't a massive deal, and I'm playing on normal mode so there's no cost and I could simply restart the mission. But I want to give a rescue mission a try... I just don't know if I can pull it off, and the FEMM is such a heavy bastard that I usually have trouble rescuing it.

My current situation is that I basically have every truck available at this point (vanilla) and deep pockets. I'm not trying to flex, I'm just saying that I've 100%'ed Michigan, Alaska, Taymyr, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, so I've got a large fleet and all the accessories. I just don't know exactly what I need to do this, and the fact that it's all in a valley adds to the challenge. But I want to at least *try*, especially since one day I might give Hard Mode a shot, and I'd like to get into the habit of doing unusual rescues.

My plan is to get whatever truck I've got with the biggest Power-to-Weight ratio is -- possibly my Pacific P512 PF or Cat CT681 -- approach from the south, winch the FEMM, and then try to just drag it south like I originally planned with the FEMM itself to drag the Fleetstar. Then I'll try to right the FEMM (which should be easy since it's only on its side), and repeat again with the Fleetstar. And I'll send out a different tanker vehicle to refill everyone's gas because I have dumped a *lot* of pollution in the air just to get to this point.

...But is there a better way? Could one of the Heavy Cranes actually *lift* the trucks? Or is winching and dragging my only option here? How would *you* rescue them, understanding that my pride in this case is stopping me from doing a simple recover?

I stood in the middle of what the Kerev called their “Orientation Hub,” but it felt more like the waiting room of the universe’s most dystopian DMV. Towering walls of smooth, pulsating crystal hummed faintly, a noise so low it felt like it was rattling around inside my skull. In the center of the room, a massive glowing obelisk flickered occasionally, displaying what I assumed were important instructions in the Kerev’s energy-weaving language. Not that I could read it.

The Kerev themselves floated--not walked, floated--into the room, their bioluminescent bodies casting a faint, bluish light. They looked like if someone had taken a jellyfish and decided, “Let’s make it an arrogant prick.”

One of them, brighter and taller than the others, approached me. I’d learned by now that brightness was their version of being a big deal. This one practically glowed like a nightclub sign, which probably meant I was about to get scolded.

“Human delegate,” it said, its voice vibrating directly in my head like a Bluetooth speaker with bad bass. “You are… out of alignment.”

I frowned. “Out of alignment with what?”

“Our protocol,” it replied, as though that was a self-evident fact. “You have deviated from the established acclimation schedule by 2.6 minutes.”

I blinked. “You’re mad because I was two minutes late?”

The Kerev didn’t blink--they didn’t even have eyes--but I could feel its disapproval radiating like a parent who just found out their kid got detention.

“Deviation introduces inefficiency,” it said.

“Well,” I said, shrugging, “I guess we’re starting off strong. Hi, I’m the walking embodiment of inefficiency. Nice to meet you.”

The Kerev didn’t respond, though I swore its glow dimmed a little.

After what felt like an eternity of bureaucratic nonsense, I was finally escorted to my “living quarters.” The Kerev called it an “adaptive residential node,” which was a fancy way of saying “a glass box in the middle of nowhere.” It was sleek, minimalist, and utterly devoid of anything resembling personality.

The walls could shift colors based on “optimal relaxation frequencies.” I set it to bright pink just to piss them off.

“This environment is calibrated for maximum efficiency,” the attendant Kerev said, its glow noticeably flickering.

“Uh-huh,” I replied, tossing my bag onto the featureless bed. “Question: where’s the coffee machine?”

“The what?”

“You know, coffee. Black gold. Liquid productivity. The thing that makes mornings tolerable?”

The Kerev paused, its glow intensifying slightly. “Your physiology requires… stimulants to achieve optimal function?”

“Yup. Welcome to humanity,” I said, smirking. “We’re basically 60% caffeine and bad decisions.”

It didn’t respond, which I took as a victory.

The next morning, I was summoned to a “Cultural Calibration Session,” which turned out to be a glorified lecture on why the Kerev were better than everyone else.

“Our civilization has persisted for 12 millennia without significant deviation,” the instructor droned, its glow pulsing rhythmically. “Our adherence to protocol has ensured stability and prosperity beyond measure.”

“Cool,” I said, raising a hand. “But, like, what happens if someone wants to… I don’t know, do something different?”

The instructor stopped glowing entirely for a moment. If the Kerev could experience a stroke, I’m pretty sure this one just did.

“Deviation,” it said finally, “is not… logical.”

“Yeah, but it’s fun,” I shot back. “Ever tried winging it? Rolling the dice? Seeing what happens when you don’t follow the rules?”

The room went silent. The other Kerev stared at me like I’d just suggested setting fire to their precious obelisk.

“That is… unthinkable,” the instructor said, its glow dimming.

I leaned back in my chair, arms crossed. “Well, buckle up, buddy. You’re about to spend a whole year with humanity’s finest disaster artist.”

If there’s one thing I learned quickly about the Kerev, it’s that they don’t do sarcasm. Or jokes. Or fun. Which, let’s be honest, made me an absolute nightmare for them.

Take breakfast, for example. My first morning on Proxima B, I was served a shimmering, gelatinous cube that pulsed faintly every few seconds.

“What is this?” I asked, poking it with my fork.

“Optimal nutrient delivery system,” the attendant Kerev replied.

“Right,” I said, inspecting the thing like it was going to explode. “And what happens if I eat it?”

“It delivers optimal nutrients.”

“Uh-huh. And what happens if I don’t eat it?”

The Kerev paused, its glow dimming slightly. “That would be inefficient.”

I sighed. “Okay, let’s play ball.” I took a bite, and immediately regretted it. The texture was somewhere between Jell-O and wet rubber, and the taste--well, let’s just say it was like licking a battery.

I forced it down, grimacing. “Delicious,” I lied. “Really hits the spot. Tastes like despair and poor life choices.”

The Kerev tilted its glowing head. “We do not understand the relevance of despair to optimal nutrition.”

“It’s a joke,” I said, rolling my eyes. “Ever heard of one?”

“No,” it replied flatly.

“Well, buckle up, ET. You’ve got a lot to learn.”

Later that day, I was invited--read: dragged--to something the Kerev called a “Resonance Alignment Ceremony.” Picture a bunch of glowing jellyfish floating in a circle, pulsing in synchronized patterns, while a weird hum vibrated through the air. It was like Burning Man, but with zero drugs and way more judgment.

I stood awkwardly in the center, trying not to ruin their big moment. Eventually, one of the Kerev floated over to me.

“You must contribute your resonance,” it said.

“My what now?”

“Your resonance,” it repeated. “Emit energy that aligns with the collective pattern.”

I blinked. “Uh… okay.” I clapped my hands twice. “That do it for you?”

The Kerev froze, its glow flickering. “What… was that?”

“That,” I said, pointing at my clapping hands, “was humanity’s contribution. You’re welcome.”

The other Kerev immediately broke formation, their pulsing patterns dissolving into chaos. One of them glowed a particularly angry shade of blue. “You have disrupted the alignment!”

I shrugged. “Alignment’s overrated. Ever heard of jazz? It’s all about the chaos, baby.”

Needless to say, they didn’t invite me back.

Adapting to Proxima B (Sort Of)

Over the next few weeks, I settled into a rhythm--if you could call antagonizing your hosts and dodging death traps a rhythm.

The planet itself was breathtaking: endless fields of bioluminescent plants that glowed under a sky filled with three suns. But everything on Proxima B wanted to kill you. There were predators with too many legs, plants that oozed acid, and weather systems that could flip from serene to apocalyptic in seconds.

Take the “rain,” for example. One day, I was enjoying a peaceful stroll when a Kerev stopped me.

“You must find shelter,” it said urgently.

“Why?” I asked. “Looks like a nice day.”

The Kerev pointed at the sky, where tiny, shimmering droplets were starting to fall.

“Rain here is not… benign,” it said.

I held out a hand, letting one of the droplets land on my skin. Within seconds, my palm started to itch. Then it burned.

“Oh, come on!” I shouted, shaking my hand. “Acid rain? Really? Who designed this place? Satan?”

The Kerev didn’t reply. It just stared at me, its glow faintly smug.

Despite my constant shenanigans, I started earning the Kerev’s respect in the weirdest ways.

One day, I found myself face-to-face with a Proxima predator--a massive, six-legged creature with glowing fangs and an attitude problem. The Kerev watched from a safe distance, their energy patterns clearly broadcasting “This idiot’s about to die.”

The beast lunged, and I reacted the only way a human would: I grabbed the closest thing I could find--a rock--and chucked it as hard as I could. It hit the creature square between the eyes, and it collapsed in a heap.

The Kerev floated over, their glows flickering in what I swear was shock.

“You neutralized it,” one of them said.

“Yeah,” I replied, panting. “It’s called improvisation. You’re welcome.”

They didn’t say it outright, but I could tell they were impressed.

Eventually, I decided the Kerev needed a crash course in humanity’s greatest cultural achievements. I uploaded my favorite Earth media into their central data hub, starting with Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

Watching their reactions was worth every second.

Watching the Kerev process Monty Python and the Holy Grail was the highlight of my time on Proxima B.

The first five minutes of the film had them thoroughly confused. As King Arthur clopped through the woods with his coconuts, the Kerev’s glowing patterns fluctuated wildly, trying to make sense of the absurdity.

“Why does the individual simulate the sound of hooves?” one of them asked, their glow oscillating in frantic bursts.

“It’s a joke,” I replied, grinning. “You’re supposed to laugh.”

The Kerev tilted its body, emitting a confused pulse. “We detect no logical purpose for this action.”

“That’s the point,” I said, throwing up my hands. “It’s funny because it’s unnecessary.”

After the third viewing of the ‘Bring out your dead’ scene, I swore one of them flickered faintly in what could have been amusement.

By the time we reached the ‘It’s just a flesh wound’ scene, I knew I had them. One of the Kerev actually stopped mid-sentence during a protocol meeting to ask, “What is the purpose of ‘tis but a scratch?’”

I leaned back in my chair, smirking. “It’s called resilience. You know, refusing to quit even when you’re missing a few limbs. Humanity specializes in that.”

The Kerev tried adapting to human humor in their own way, which went about as well as you’d expect.

One evening, I found them attempting their version of a “comedy routine.” A group of Kerev floated in a circle, emitting perfectly synchronized light pulses. It looked impressive, but it was about as funny as a tax audit.

“Is this… entertaining?” one of them asked, their glow flickering nervously.

“Uh…” I tried to find the politest way to answer, which for me meant, “Nope. This sucks.”

The Kerev dimmed in unison, which I took as their version of pouting.

“Listen,” I said, clapping a hand on what I assumed was a shoulder equivalent. “You’re overthinking it. Comedy isn’t about precision; it’s about chaos. It’s when something completely unexpected happens, and you can’t help but laugh.”

They stared at me, their glows dim. “Chaos… as entertainment?”

“Yes!” I said, pulling up another classic. This time, it was Airplane!. Watching their light patterns implode during the ‘Surely you can’t be serious’ scene was a personal victory.

A month into my stay, the Kerev had a full-blown crisis. One of their predator containment zones had failed, and a massive creature--something that looked like a cross between a bear and a scorpion on steroids--was rampaging through their city.

While the Kerev scrambled to follow their precious protocols, I grabbed a flare gun, duct tape, and a pack of crackers.

“You are not authorized to engage!” one of them protested as I headed toward the chaos.

“Yeah, well, you’re not authorized to let it eat everyone,” I shot back.

The predator cornered me in one of their glowing corridors, its fangs dripping with something that looked like pure hatred. I didn’t have a gun, but I had the human instinct to improvise.

I lit the flare and chucked the crackers into the air. The beast, apparently intrigued by shiny objects, lunged at the distraction. I used the opportunity to duct tape the flare to its tail and dive out of the way. The flare’s heat spooked the thing so badly it smashed through a wall and bolted back into the wilderness.

The Kerev found me sitting in the wreckage, eating the last of my crackers.

“You neutralized the predator,” one of them said, its glow pulsing in what I swear was awe.

“Yeah,” I replied, shrugging. “That’s called problem-solving. You should try it sometime.”

After that, the Kerev started treating me differently. They still didn’t understand me, but they began to respect what they called my “chaotic methodology.”

Their leader, a particularly bright and stern individual named Ziraen, even invited me to a high-level strategy meeting.

“We have analyzed your… improvisational tactics,” Ziraen said, its glow steady. “While unorthodox, they appear to yield results.”

I leaned back in my chair, smirking. “That’s humanity for you. We don’t just think outside the box--we set the box on fire and make a new one.”

Ziraen didn’t laugh, but its glow flickered faintly. Progress.

Everything changed six months in. A massive, unknown ship appeared in Proxima B’s orbit, broadcasting nothing but a low-frequency hum that made the Kerev panic.

“This is a Class Omega threat,” Ziraen said, its glow flashing wildly. “We must adhere to emergency protocols.”

“Or,” I said, leaning forward, “we wing it.”

The Kerev stared at me. “You cannot… wing a Class Omega threat.”

“Watch me,” I replied, cracking my knuckles.

The massive alien ship loomed in the Proxima B sky, casting a shadow over the glowing city below. It was like nothing I’d ever seen--monolithic, covered in pulsating organic armor that rippled like it was alive. The hum emanating from it wasn’t just loud; it was oppressive, vibrating through the very bones of the planet.

The Kerev were in full panic mode. Their glows were erratic, their movements scattered as they attempted to follow their emergency protocols.

“This ship is unlike anything in our database,” Ziraen said, its glow dim and trembling. “We are unable to establish communication. It does not respond to logic or resonance patterns.”

“Shocking,” I said, strapping on the Kerev equivalent of body armor, which felt more like wearing an electrified poncho. “Maybe that’s because logic doesn’t scare people. Chaos does.”

“What is your plan, human?” Ziraen asked, its glow faintly tinged with desperation.

I smirked. “Wing it.”

The Kerev’s planetary defenses had already been disabled by the ship’s first pulse--a technology that wiped out anything running on predictable systems. That meant I had an advantage, because if there’s one thing humanity excels at, it’s being wildly unpredictable.

I commandeered a Kerev reconnaissance craft, which looked more like a glowing marble than a ship, and set course for the alien vessel.

“You are unqualified to operate this craft!” one of the Kerev shouted as I climbed aboard.

“Don’t worry,” I said, hitting a bunch of buttons at random. “I’ve played Star Fox.”

The craft jolted violently, nearly spinning out of control before I figured out how to stabilize it. I glanced at the controls. None of them made sense, but that was fine. Improvisation was my specialty.

The Kerev’s voices buzzed in my earpiece. “You are deviating from all established flight paths!”

“Yeah, that’s the point,” I replied. “They can’t predict what I’m doing if I don’t know what I’m doing.”

The alien ship started firing at me, its weapons glowing with a sickly green energy that crackled through the void. I zigzagged, looped, and spun, moving in ways no AI would ever think to replicate.

“They’re missing,” Ziraen said, its voice tinged with disbelief.

“They’re confused,” I corrected.
The massive alien ship loomed in the Proxima B sky, casting a shadow over the glowing city below. It was like nothing I’d ever seen—monolithic, covered in pulsating organic armor that rippled like it was alive.

“Turns out, flying like a drunk pigeon has its perks.”
The massive alien ship loomed in the Proxima B sky, casting a shadow over the glowing city below. It was like nothing I’d ever seen—monolithic, covered in pulsating organic armor that rippled like it was alive.

I maneuvered the craft close to the alien ship, ejecting at the last second before my ride collided with its hull in a fiery explosion. The Kerev were screaming in my earpiece about how reckless I was, but I ignored them.

My magnetic boots latched onto the hull, and I began making my way toward what looked like an entrance--a pulsating, organic hatch that was opening and closing like a mouth.

“This is a terrible idea,” I muttered to myself. “Which means it’s probably going to work.”

I entered the ship, immediately greeted by a dark, pulsating corridor that felt alive. The walls seemed to breathe, and a low, guttural sound echoed through the space.

“Good news,” I said into my comms. “I’m inside. Bad news: this place looks like the set of Alien. If I see a facehugger, I’m out.”

After navigating a labyrinth of pulsating corridors, I found myself in what I assumed was the ship’s control center. It was a massive, glowing chamber filled with writhing tendrils and a central core that pulsed with green light.

“This has to be the brain,” I said. “Or the heart. Or the spleen. I don’t know, but I’m blowing it up.”

The Kerev’s voice crackled in my ear. “You must analyze it first! We require data--”

“No time,” I interrupted, pulling out the homemade EMP device I’d cobbled together from spare parts. It wasn’t pretty, but it would do the job.

I placed the device on the core, setting the timer for ten seconds.

“Goodbye, creepy murder ship,” I said, stepping back as the countdown began.

The ship began to shake violently as the EMP detonated, sending a surge of energy through its systems. Lights flickered, tendrils flailed, and the low hum turned into a deafening roar.

I sprinted back toward the hatch, dodging collapsing walls and bursts of green energy.

“Your trajectory is… chaotic!” Ziraen shouted.

“Welcome to my life,” I replied, leaping out of the hatch just as the ship began to implode.

The explosion lit up the sky, a cascade of green and white energy that sent shockwaves rippling through the atmosphere. I activated my emergency beacon, and within seconds, a Kerev retrieval craft swooped in to catch me.

Back on Proxima B, the Kerev were silent as I stepped off the retrieval craft, bruised, battered, and grinning like an idiot.

Ziraen approached, its glow steady but faint. “You have neutralized the threat… through methods we cannot comprehend.”

“That’s called being human,” I said, smirking. “We don’t play by the rules. We make them up as we go.”

Ziraen paused, its glow flickering faintly. “Your… chaos is effective. Terrifying, but effective.”

“You’re welcome,” I replied, clapping it on what I assumed was its shoulder.

As I sat in my quarters that night, staring at the glowing sky of Proxima B, I couldn’t help but laugh. Humanity wasn’t the smartest, the fastest, or the strongest species in the galaxy. But we had one thing no one else did: the ability to adapt, to improvise, and to thrive in the chaos.

Before I get the 'just move out' comments I would have moved long ago, I'm not here for fun. Due to various factors such as cost of living and rental availability, I cannot immediately move out.

Originally things weren't that bad, she also had no job and was studying, while her parents are so poor they couldn't even afford to give her a spare $50. I felt sorry for her so I bought her some food, offered to share things like food and toiletries with an add-on buying house basics e.g toilet paper, butter, milk, sugar, coffee, etc. She once got mad at me for not buying salt and pepper yet actively used mine. The cracks started pretty early like immediately trying to get money off me to give to her brother then getting mad at me. I realised later why she had nothing was because she spent her student allowance on weed. She takes antidepressants and anti-psychotics yet that's impeded by her weed consumption.

Later on this escalated to continuously stealing and using my stuff without permission. 2 of the most obsessive ones was drinking my drinks and later finding her sucking on my toothpaste. Turns out she has BPD and is an impossible c#nt to deal with. Whenever I caught her stealing or using something of mine her go to reaction is 'I was confused! It was an accident!' Once I didn't even speak to her. I found her happily walking out of the laundry wearing my clothes where I was looking down at her from the stairs, immediately she said 'I was confused it was an accident!' then when she gave my shirt back there were holes in it. You cannot talk to her because she immediately goes on defence, twists reality, gaslight, and/or hides like when I went to talk to her about sucking on my toothpaste. She even starts breathing hard or flip flops between tantrums and victimisation. She once told me I cannot say anything about her behaviour because it feels like a personal attack. I told her to stop drinking my drinks and she acted as if I spat on her. Sometimes she goes into straight up caveman mode like she will see me with something then just wants it. E.g I was drinking konjac jelly that she doesn't even like or want so she tried sneaking it, obviously didn't like it but clearly opened it then into the back of the fridge. Once she was drinking one of drinks and like a child when I walked into the kitchen quickly chugged it then tried to hide it in the bin before immediately running away- the worst part she had the same drinks but just wanted to steal mine.

It's like she glees from crossing my boundaries and needs my attention. If I ignore her she will brazenly start doing things in front of me to provoke reactions, if I do react she seeks revenge or tells people I make her feel unsafe. She decided to give me the silent treatment which was actually really nice, then got mad because I didn't care.

I've come to realise she just takes things from other people and those people have normalised it. I tell her 'no' and she gets upset she has actual adult tantrums because she's told no or confronted by her behaviour. On the flipside she acts like a dragon hoarding it's treasure when it comes to her stuff. E.g she wouldn't let me borrow a USB stick but then wanted to borrow my phone charger, I said no and her reaction is the same response as if I backhanded her.

I'm disgusted by her growing up poor like a lot of us but feeling entitled to take people's stuff, the lack of boundaries, the way she immediately tried to get money off me, and lots of other things including poor period care. She has dripped and left period on the bathroom floor, in the shower, on the kitchen floor, and left her pads to rot in the bathroom bin. Idk why she is not noticing the dripping. The worst part is she can function well enough that people don't know what she is like in general. Also having BPD she seems to want to get ""revenge"" on any perceived slight so she'll immediately do something like stick my hair brush into the toilet, destroy my items, or go hide and cry because she didn't get her way.

Now she's telling people I'm aggressive and she feels unsafe despite the times she followed me around berating me, she got her friends to try prank call me for weeks, and other things indicating that's not actually true. I said to her why do you feel the need to steal and use my stuff without permission, she started with 'I actually don't see it that way' I said I know you don't, then she tried to give an example saying well I also take things from X, Y, Z as well, I said 'yeah, and that's weird why are you taking so many people's stuff' then she couldn't come up with a reason so she ran away crying. I'm not angry all the time I am frustrated living with this POS who cries wolf whenever she gets in trouble.

She does so much illogical, flip flopping BS it is actually draining me. I feel like she is trying wear me down with exhaustion so she can feel in control or something. ",0,1733326970.0,BPD_Survivors,1,0.5,False
1h6j2qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelliJIDEA/comments/1h6j2qk/seeking_feedback_on_my_uncoming_intellij_idea/,Seeking feedback on my uncoming IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Spring developers,"Hi guys, in the recent months, I have been working on an IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Spring developers, it can scan endpoints and send requests. After months of coding, debugging, and countless cups of coffee, it's finally ready to launch this week!

Usually when developing REST APIs, I often switch between IntelliJ IDEA and Postman. But I thought, wouldn't it be more convenient to develop and test REST APIs all in one place? Which led me to creating this plugin. I hope this plugin will be better than the built-in HTTP Client, and compatible with the IntelliJ IDEA community edition.

**Here's what it can do:**

1. **API client**: Detect endpoints in Spring projects from Java/Kotlin code, generate requests, and send them with just one click.
2. **Generate OAS definition**: Generate OpenAPI spec based on **Spring** annotations and **Javadoc** comments, without any Swagger annotations (I don't like them). But it also works with existing Swagger annotations if you're working for your company's project.
3. **Export API documentation**: Export API docs in formats including OpenAPI (Swagger), HTML, Markdown, Postman, and more.
4. Additional features include automatic request parameter filling, tree structure display, and response parsing—all within your IDE.

The plugin is designed to work out-of-the-box with zero configuration. Furthermore, it also has highly flexible customization options for advanced users. If you're tired of copying URLs and parameters back and forth, or dealing with bulky annotations, this plugin could be just what you need.

**The best part?**

I want to make this tool **FREE** to help as many developers as possible!

**Why did I post this?**

I'm moving closer to the official release and that's why I am eager to get feedback from devs like you. For example, would anyone need support for other web frameworks like **Quarkus** and **Helidon**?

Thank you in advance for all your advice.

1h6iy9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6iy9o/an_inspiring_startup_story_with_a_twist/,An Inspiring Startup Story with a Twist,"**It started with a trip.**

In the spring of 2023, a startup founder & CEO boarded a flight to Silicon Valley. At that time, AI for startups felt more like a buzzword than a business necessity. For his fast-growing startup, it seemed smarter to stick to proven strategies, keep costs lean, and avoid distractions. 

“Let the early adopters gamble,” he thought. “We’ll step in later if AI turns out to be more than just a trend.”

But Silicon Valley has a way of flipping your perspective.

Over the next few days of meetings, coffees and late-night conversations with seasoned founders, investors, and technologists, this CEO heard a message he couldn’t ignore. These weren’t just dreamers — they were doers and builders with a track record of spotting paradigm shifts before they happened. 

And they all agreed on one thing: 

**AI isn’t a trend — it’s the next big shift.**

They compared it to the internet boom of the ’90s and the rise of smartphones in the 2000s. “This isn’t about efficiency,” one founder told him. “It’s about survival. If you’re not using AI, you’re already behind.”

By the time his plane touched back down, he was no longer a skeptic. He had a new mission: bring AI into his business before it was too late.

Within months, his company had completely transformed. They reorganized teams, launched AI experiments, and rewrote their marketing playbook to make AI a cornerstone of their strategy. 

What happened next?

By early 2024, his company had transformed:

* **3.3 billion ad impressions** driven by AI-powered campaigns.
* **40% better ROI** on video ads, while cutting production costs.
* **Freed-up resources** for bold, creative projects that scaled their impact.

That CEO is Anton Pavlovsky, and the company in the story is Headway, a Ukrainian edtech startup leading the way in AI-driven growth.

But this story isn’t just about Headway. It’s about what AI can do for your business—if you start today.",1,1733326668.0,startups,1,1.0,False

I have been a very confident and energetic kid, I used to have 50-60 friends when I was in childhood. I don’t know what happened but now even talking to strangers feel scary. Like in a restaurant, I don’t know how to tell the waiter the dish is wrong because I feel that I could be wrong. Or the few friends I have, I feel I shouldn’t talk first because I might annoy them. My confidence comes up and goes down like an elevator, never constant. I overthink things A LOT.   


Today, I was doing good in my maths class and improved a lot so my confidence was up. But it came down to negative in seconds when my english teacher started tapping for no reason. She is a good teacher but she has a habit of talking ill about me to my mom for half an hour non stop once every week as she comes once in a week at my house (one more guy comes to study). So in our recent test, I got 65.5/80 and he got 67/80. I usually get higher than him and a nice grade so she like the usual targeted in pointing a small mistake. She was just asking questions orally so he said a wrong, a silly answer so she laughed it off. When I gave wrong, literally after that, she said in a loud tone “Read your notes, (my name)!”   

After the class ends, my mother gives coffee to her. She just started to talk ill about me to my mother. She started lecturing me.

I had not done the homework today, half of the worksheet. I had done the other half. I agree I procrastinated a bit as I was tired. The other guy once in a while always forgets, he never gets lectured for it?  

I just went in my room and locked myself. She talked and told ill about me to my mom for HALF AN HOUR! I agree a teacher should tell the parent their child’s mistake. But what the fuck is she telling for half an hour that I didn’t do my homework?   

I take things to heart. Lately I had been very down till I got a bit confident today only to get down more. She is an amazing mom and I share 99% things with her. She told me what happened. I was kind of in bad mood and all because of this shit again of her usual weekly lecturing me for no fucking reason. So I blamed my mother for random shit. I feel like a jerk being rude to her. I started to cry and right now am.   


She explained that I think negatively and suggested I should see a therapist or counsellor. Due to my lately breakdown and stuff being more open. I refused again.  

But now I don’t know why I am crying for this, I don’t even feel like studying now or anything or even going out of my room.

(I feel like I am dying),"I'm trying to move house because my housemate is a menace. Before I get the 'just move out' comments I would have moved long ago, I'm not here for fun. Due to various factors such as cost of living and rental availability, I cannot immediately move out.

Originally things weren't that bad, she also had no job and was studying, while her parents are so poor they couldn't even afford to give her a spare $50. I felt sorry for her so I bought her some food, offered to share things like food and toiletries with an add-on buying house basics e.g toilet paper, butter, milk, sugar, coffee, etc. She once got mad at me for not buying salt and pepper yet actively used mine. The cracks started pretty early like immediately trying to get money off me to give to her brother then getting mad at me. I realised later why she had nothing was because she spent her student allowance on weed. She takes antidepressants and anti-psychotics yet that's impeded by her weed consumption.

Later on this escalated to continuously stealing and using my stuff without permission. 2 of the most obsessive ones was drinking my drinks and later finding her sucking on my toothpaste. Turns out she has BPD and is an impossible c#nt to deal with. Whenever I caught her stealing or using something of mine her go to reaction is 'I was confused! It was an accident!' Once I didn't even speak to her. I found her happily walking out of the laundry wearing my clothes where I was looking down at her from the stairs, immediately she said 'I was confused it was an accident!' then when she gave my shirt back there were holes in it. You cannot talk to her because she immediately goes on defence, twists reality, gaslight, and/or hides like when I went to talk to her about sucking on my toothpaste. She even starts breathing hard or flip flops between tantrums and victimisation. She once told me I cannot say anything about her behaviour because it feels like a personal attack.

so my mother is extremely manipulative, and i suspect that she is a narcissist amongst other things. while she has done a lot of things to support me like paying for my studies, buying me clothes, going on family trips (that she would often ruin), going to the restaurant, and other things (when i told this to my friends and partners, they all said that ""this is the bare minimum"" and it kind of shocked me, because i hadnt realized and felt bad about being so (rightfully) upset at my mom), she has ruined my life and the way i feel things and express myself in so many different ways. she is also ableist (despite having two disabled children including me), racist, transphobic, islamophobic, fatphobic, and more. i could write a lot about things she's said to me or about other people, but that would probably take too much time, and that really isnt the point of my post. basically, she is very mean to me and other people, very bitter and judgmental. it is very draining to be around her because she always complains about everything, and i will never be good enough for her

  
the most recent thing that she's done was throwing a tantrum in front of my partners when she, my dad, and my brother were visiting (i moved from my home country to another, and i feel so much better now that im away from her). this wasnt the first time my gf was meeting my mom, but my bf hadnt met her before, and the first impression was.. not the best. she got extremely upset because, and i swear im not making this up, i didnt make her lasagna at my house like she had wanted me to. mind you, we live in quite a small house just for two or three people, so having double the amount wasnt the most comfortable (and my mom isnt the skinniest person alive). both my partners were standing, my parents and brother were on the couch, and i had to sit on the desk chair by the coffee table, so i was NOT exaggerating 

we argued the day before because my gf had told me that having them over for dinner was going to be extremely overwhelming, and that we wouldnt have the space, and she (my mom) reluctantly accepted that there wouldnt be any lasagna, but snacks instead. when she was looking around the house, she kept making rude comments, and eventually said ""you're not gonna like this, but i for one think that there was plenty of space for us to eat here, it was really selfish of you not to make the lasagna. if you didnt want us over, you just had to say so"" and that made me snap, which ended in her storming out of the house and basically telling me and my partners to fuck off. great first impression, thanks mom !!

the day after, we had to help them get to the airport (mainly because they dont speak english, and that i had to help with directions) and (this is kinda funny) when we got into the subway she power-walked all the way to the other end of the train to sit as far away as possible. my dad felt and looked completely hopeless and disappointed, and he had to sit with mom for the whole hour instead of spending the last vacation time with us. poor guy. and then we got to the airport (this is even more funny), i handed the passports to the ticket lady and my mom REFUSED to hand my hers and was almost teasing me about it, just rising her passport away from me so i wouldnt touch it, only to eventually slam it on the desk in front of everyone. yikes. i feel bad for my dad because he has to live with her 24/7

anyway, she didnt bother saying bye to anyone, and hasnt spoken to me since the evening she stormed out of the house (in july). as far as i can remember, ive always gotten the silent treatment when my mom was upset. even when i didnt know what i had done wrong, she would ignore me for days at a time, until i would basically crawl at her feet begging for forgiveness, or write her letters apologizing for something i didnt even know i had done. either that or yell at me and say extremely mean things to me, and then coming back crying over how ""bad of a mom"" she is. and despite me telling her multiple times how harmful it is (especially for growing children) to give the silent treatment, it's always her go-to ""punishment"" towards me, or sometimes my dad

i probably forgot some details, but i think you get the picture

  
now i have quite a small family, and christmas at home always makes me feel depressed, especially since i moved out to another country, and experienced christmas in a big and loving family that is my partners'. being at my parents / around my mom makes me mental health go extremely low, and i literally start feeling suicidal again despite being clean for several years now. i feel guilty for not coming this year either (although i physically cant, even if i wanted to bc of a recent surgery), but i still want to send a package for my dad, my brother, and my aunt. but idk if my mom really deserves a gift. 

my dilemma is, if i dont send her a gift, i will hear about it for the rest of my life, and she might ruin christmas for my family like she does every year (again, i have a lot of stories of things she's done because of her ridiculous tantrums) 

BUT if i do send her a gift, its like she wins again. it's like i'll be crawling at her feet begging for forgiveness like i did as a child. i dont want to be submissive to my mother anymore, i quite frankly dislike her. while it feels very nice not to bother sending her messages every single day, or suffer her mean responses or useless comments, i still feel some guilt (which i assume is normal, considering how manipulative she is). i dont want her to have power over me again 

would it be wrong not to send her a gift ? she also has her birthday early in january, i dont want to wish her happy birthday either, but it feels so wrong :( i feel really stuck,, i dont even know if \*she\* is going to give me anything for that matter 



i think ive said anything now, i really tried to keep it short but i have so many things i could say about her, that could probably contribute to the ""not-sending-her-a-gift"" option, but im afraid it will be too long to read. just ask if you want any funny stories, i guess !! oh and this is of any use, i am 21 and my mom is over 60

  
tldr: would i be the asshole for sending a gift to my aunt, my dad, and my brother, but not my mom considering she has been abusive to me all my life and hasnt spoken a single word to me since july ?",1,1733326446.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I recently got my hands on the Miele U1 Powerline vacuum cleaner. This upright model caught my eye with its sleek white design and promise of powerful cleaning.

The U1 Powerline has some neat features. I like how it can swivel and lie flat to get under furniture. The LED lights on the front help me spot dirt in dark spots. It's pretty easy to use too, with a dial to change suction power for different surfaces.

https://preview.redd.it/wyrvl2m8pu4e1.jpg?width=487&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dfc984cbdd4fa47a8b3d88404fda691cba76df9

This vacuum uses bags and has a HEPA filter. That's good for trapping dust and allergens. The long cord is handy, so I don't have to keep plugging it in as I clean. It comes with some tools for cleaning different areas.

I found the U1 Powerline works well on both carpets and bare floors. The brush roll can be turned off for delicate surfaces. It's pretty sturdy too - Miele says it's tested for 20 years of use.

One thing to note is that this vacuum is on the heavy side. It might be hard to carry up stairs. The bags need to be replaced, which is an ongoing cost.

# Bottom Line

The Miele U1 Powerline is a solid choice for a home vacuum. It cleans well and has some smart features.

# Overview of Miele Dynamic U1 Powerline Upright Vacuum Cleaner

I recently got my hands on the Miele U1 Powerline and put it through its paces. This upright vacuum packs a punch with its 1,200-watt motor. I found it works well on both carpets and bare floors. The swivel neck makes it easy to steer around furniture.

One cool feature is the LED headlight. It helped me spot dust in dark corners. The vacuum has a 6-liter bag and HEPA filter, which is great for trapping allergens. I like that I can adjust the suction power with a dial.

On the downside, it's a bit heavy to lug up stairs. The cord is long at 39.5 feet, but I still had to unplug and move to new outlets in larger rooms. While it cleans well, the price is steep compared to some other options.

# Swivel Neck Joint for Superior Maneuverability

I found the swivel neck on this vacuum to be a game-changer. It lets me steer around furniture and into tight spots with ease. I could clean under my coffee table without moving it. The vacuum lies flat, so I reached way under my couch too.

The LED headlight on the front helped me see dust bunnies in dark corners. I didn't miss a spot.

This feature made vacuuming feel less like a chore. I zipped around my living room quickly. No more awkward pushing and pulling to get into tricky areas.

While the swivel neck is great, it took me a little time to get used to. At first, the vacuum felt a bit wobbly. But after a few uses, I got the hang of it and loved how nimble it made cleaning.

# Adjustable Suction with Rotary Dial

I found the 4-setting rotary dial on this vacuum really handy. It let me easily change the suction power for different surfaces. When I moved from carpet to hardwood, I just turned the dial to lower the suction. This helped me avoid scratching my floors. The strongest setting was great for deep cleaning my thick rugs. I liked being able to adjust on the fly without stopping. The dial was easy to reach and turn while vacuuming. It made a big difference in how well the vacuum worked on different areas of my home.

# HEPA AirClean Filter for Allergy and Asthma Sufferers

I was really impressed by the HEPA AirClean filter in this Miele vacuum. It traps 99.995% of tiny particles, which is great for people with allergies or asthma. I noticed a big difference in air quality after vacuuming. The filter works with the sealed system to keep dust from escaping.

The vacuum comes with one HEPA filter installed and 4 extra bags. This is nice since I won't have to buy replacements for a while. Changing the filter is easy too.

While the HEPA filter is a big plus, it does make the vacuum a bit pricier. But for clean air, I think it's worth it. Just keep in mind you'll need to replace the filter every so often to keep it working well.

# Ultra-Bright LED Lights for Visibility in Dark Areas

I love the LED headlight on this vacuum. It's super bright and really helps me see under furniture and in dark corners. The light is on the front of the vacuum, so it shines right where I'm cleaning. This is great for spotting dust bunnies and small items I might have missed. I've used it to clean under my bed and couch, and it made a big difference. The light stays on all the time, which is handy. It's a simple feature, but it makes cleaning easier and more thorough. I think it's one of the best parts of this Miele vacuum.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using the Miele Dynamic U1 for a while now, and I've got some thoughts to share. This upright vacuum has its strengths and weaknesses. Let's break them down.

# Pros

* Powerful suction that picks up dirt and debris effectively
* HEPA filter traps small particles, good for allergy sufferers
* Durable build quality, feels like it will last a long time
* Easy to maneuver around furniture and corners
* Large dust bag capacity means less frequent changes

# Cons

* Quite expensive compared to other vacuum cleaners
* Heavy to push and carry up stairs
* Can be loud during operation
* Replacement bags and filters are pricey
* Some users report suction issues after months of use

I found the Miele U1 to be a mixed bag. It cleans really well when it's working properly, but it's not without its issues. The strong suction power is great for deep cleaning carpets, and the HEPA filter is a big plus for keeping the air clean. I like how it moves smoothly around my home.

On the flip side, it's heavier than I expected, which makes cleaning stairs a chore. The noise level is also higher than I'd prefer. While the build quality feels solid, I'm a bit worried about long-term reliability based on some user experiences. The ongoing cost of bags and filters is something to keep in mind too.

Overall, it's a powerful cleaner, but you'll need to weigh the pros and cons to decide if it's right for you.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this Miele upright vacuum for a while now, and it's clear why opinions are mixed. The 3.7-star rating from 118 reviews shows both ups and downs. Many users praise its strong suction and HEPA filtration, which are great for deep cleaning. But some have faced issues with reliability after a few months.

One big plus is how it handles different floor types. The brush roll adjusts easily, making it good for both carpets and hard floors. The build quality feels solid too - it's not flimsy like some cheaper models.

On the flip side, a few users reported problems with suction loss over time. This seems to be hit-or-miss though. Some had to get repairs, while others say it's still going strong after years.

The price is steep, but many feel it's worth it for the cleaning power and air filtration. Just be aware that like any machine, it may need maintenance down the road.

# Efficiency for Different Floor Types

I tested this Miele vacuum on various surfaces in my home. It shines on carpets, easily pulling out deep-down dirt. The strong suction and brush roll work together to lift embedded particles. On hard floors, it picks up dust and debris well too. I found it glides smoothly from carpet to tile or hardwood. The vacuum has power settings I can adjust for different floor types. This helps me clean efficiently without damaging delicate surfaces. One drawback is it's a bit heavy to push on thick carpets. But overall, it tackles most floor types with ease. The large wheels make it simple to maneuver around furniture and between rooms.

# Maintenance and Usability Features

I found this vacuum really easy to use and maintain. The 6-liter bag holds a lot of dirt, so I don't have to change it often. When I do, it's a quick and clean process. The 4-setting dial lets me adjust suction for different floors. I like how it lies flat to clean under furniture. The LED headlight is handy for dark spots. It comes with useful tools like a crevice tool and dusting brush. The HEPA filter traps allergens well, which is great for my allergies. Changing the filter is simple too. While it's not the lightest vacuum, the swivel neck makes it easy to steer around furniture. The 144-inch hose gives me good reach for stairs and high spots.

# Conclusion

I've been using this Miele vacuum for a while now, and I have mixed feelings. It's a solid machine with strong suction and HEPA filtration, which is great for allergy sufferers. The build quality feels sturdy, typical of Miele products. But it's not perfect. Some users report reliability issues after a few months, which is concerning for such a pricey vacuum. The cost of replacement bags and filters adds up too. While it cleans well when working properly, I'm not sure it's worth the high price tag given the potential problems. If you're set on a Miele, consider their canister models which seem to have a better track record. For most people, there are likely better options available that offer similar performance for less money.",1,1733326399.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False
1h6isvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1h6isvz/story_of_a_skeptical_startup_founder/,Story of a Skeptical Startup Founder,"**It started with a trip.**

In the spring of 2023, a startup founder & CEO boarded a flight to Silicon Valley. At that time, AI for startups felt more like a buzzword than a business necessity. For his fast-growing startup, it seemed smarter to stick to proven strategies, keep costs lean, and avoid distractions. 

“Let the early adopters gamble,” he thought. “We’ll step in later if AI turns out to be more than just a trend.”

But Silicon Valley has a way of flipping your perspective.

Over the next few days of meetings, coffees and late-night conversations with seasoned founders, investors, and technologists, this CEO heard a message he couldn’t ignore. These weren’t just dreamers — they were doers and builders with a track record of spotting paradigm shifts before they happened. 

And they all agreed on one thing: 

**AI isn’t a trend — it’s the next big shift.**

They compared it to the internet boom of the ’90s and the rise of smartphones in the 2000s. “This isn’t about efficiency,” one founder told him. “It’s about survival. If you’re not using AI, you’re already behind.”

By the time his plane touched back down, he was no longer a skeptic. He had a new mission: bring AI into his business before it was too late.

Within months, his company had completely transformed. They reorganized teams, launched AI experiments, and rewrote their marketing playbook to make AI a cornerstone of their strategy. 

What happened next?

By early 2024, his company had transformed:

* **3.3 billion ad impressions** driven by AI-powered campaigns.
* **40% better ROI** on video ads, while cutting production costs.
* **Freed-up resources** for bold, creative projects that scaled their impact.

That CEO is Anton Pavlovsky, and the company in the story is Headway, a Ukrainian edtech startup leading the way in AI-driven growth.

But this story isn’t just about Headway. It’s about what artificial intelligence can do for your business—if you start today.

1h6irxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1h6irxu/i_need_help_processing_this/,I need help processing this!,"I have both Autism and ADHD which in my case means that I overthink and aren't great at reading what people really mean. I'm currently struggling to cope with rejection and need help understanding if it was me, her or a combination of both.

We got chatting two weeks ago, she's more sex oriented and so am I to an extent. We clicked quite well and met a week later. She lives 150miles aways but because my hobby has taken me to her area regularly it wasn't an issue. Her ideal was a night in a hotel, but with schedules clashing I asked her if she had a small window for an introductory meet. My intentions were for a simple coffee and chat, she had other ideas!

She works nights so we arranged a 2hr meet, she suggested a service station car park. Now she has quite a history sexually, started very young, described herself as a sex addict and mentioned having sex with different men on one holiday... one each night. Even mentioned playing people off each other and having two guys in one night. This was until she met her husband.... until years down the line his libido dropped and she found herself affairing.

Now, she was lovely, we gelled very well and I found her attractive and my God sexually she was all I've waited for. So after three years of stop start searching and dates that went nowhere beyond a kiss and touching I found myself in the car on the way to what sounded like my rite of passage.. a sexual encounter. Albeit ahead of the schedule I would have liked (I want an emotional bond also).

So in the early hours of the morning her SUV hosted an hour of kissing, a blowjob, fingering and two female orgasms. I had probably the best sexual experience maybe ever in that short window and I gave her 100% each millisecond. The wheels then fell off, expecting to give her 'aftercare' consisting of hugs, kisses and convo she began to do things that indirectly told me ""get out of my car"". Her body language was distant, eye contact not great and three times she mentioned parking time limit... in the end I left after saying ""if you want me to go just say""

She later said she was tired, that she was concerned about being spotted in what was her area with more cars were arriving and dawn approaching. But why not say that at the time?
My ADHD brain convinced me that she was returning to sex addiction because my Autistic brain wasn't coping well with the uncertainty. What had happened, if anything actually happened at all? In the end I said how I felt to her and she said that constantly having to reassure me was the only reason I wasn't for her.

She also said she felt judged by some of the things I said. I feel ashamed, embarrassed, disheartened and am questioning myself. Maybe it was all me in the first place... but on all the dates I've had no one ever became detached, everyone mostly gave it their all.

* Calypso can be found in the hallways of high schools, acting like that one pick me and constantly putting down other girls in front of boys, hoping to get picked, begging to get picked, and yet no one picks her. It really isn't her fault that society taught her that the only validation is male validation and the only way to receive it is by seeing other women as competition and putting them down. She really just wants to be loved, for once she wants to be picked over whatever other duty the hero has. 
* Medusa can be found wearing a satin silk robe and sipping wine in her backyard. She is that one single rich aunt who gives the best advice and hates all men. She uses her wealth for charity to unfortunate young girls who have been SA’d, and her house is often used as a refugee place for young girls to stay in. Every time a man blames it on the clothes or your relatives tell you to cover up, medusa glares at them with such hatred in her eyes it scares them off. 
* Sigyn can be found in friendly neighborhoods, she’s a traditional wife who stays at home and bakes cookies for all her neighbors, her smiles so insanely contagious. She hates when people send hate comments online, encourages forgiveness, and constantly complains about how this world needs more mercy. She can be seen wearing long floral dresses and reading or baking in the backyard, waiting for her husband, who works in the mafia, to return home. She often ties her long hair in a braid and has a weird hatred towards snakes claiming that they scare her. 
* Bheema can be found moving from restaurant to restaurant and is known to be the best cook in town, he is that one chef who personally serves you food and makes jokes, he can also be found sneaking food into his mouth. His jokes are known to make anyone laugh, they say he can befriend anyone despite his intimidating build he is the nicest person. He seems to have a creepily accurate sense of direction and can always tell the weather. He often stands on his balcony claiming that he likes the feel of wind on his face.

* Bellona can be found on her black police bike which she traded her chariot for, she is the sort of police who waves their gun at anyone who mildly looks threatening. She leads a different battle now one against murderers and serial killers. Her battles don't look as fierce anymore but they still remain just as dangerous. She is often found bent over her desk, her nose bleeding from another wound, drinking coffee as she tries to identify the culprit who killed 9 women. 
* Freyja can either be found in high school house parties or underground ring fights- there is no in-between. She has a weird obsession with fur clothing and has 4 cats. In high school parties, she watches as young love blossoms and sour ones break apart all while she wishes her husband loved her nearly enough to return home to her. She is often caught using her powers to make your crush say yes when you finally muster up the courage to ask them. In underground ring fights she places so many bets and always somehow wins even when she doesn't participate. Men love to call her a witch.
* Odysseus can be found teaching in high schools and colleges or stuck in nearly endless traffic. He is that one favorite history professor that everyone loves and is often teased for constantly finding ways to bring up his wife in absolutely any context. His friends often drag him into messy situations which results in him lying rather creatively to get them out of trouble. He always leaves early from work claiming that the traffic is huge and that he wants to get home to his wife and son but still somehow gets stuck in the worst traffic jams and comes back home at 10:30. 
* Arjun can be found zoning out in every one of his classes and yet when asked a question he answers correctly every time. He is that one rather silent guy with dimples who is constantly followed by a flock of girls. He is often found reading, playing chess, or throwing darts and somehow hitting the bullseye every single time without fail. He sits in the rain and listens to the sound of thunder while watching the lightning strike across the sky. He plays basketball and manages to get the ball in all the time, when asked how he does it he answers with ‘I have good aim’. All the girls love him. 
* Hecuba is found in her little cottage, baking goods for the neighboring kids because now all her kids, grandkids, and husband are dead, whenever anyone asks her how they died she gets this far away look and replies with ‘in war’. She loves telling stories to children, ridiculous tales of when she was a queen. She is extremely old, wrinkles matting her once-beautiful face. She hates all the hype greek gods and greek heroes get in the western culture. She curses out at the news channel when they report about war.

1h6ij8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/comments/1h6ij8o/this_game_fing_rules/,This game f***ing rules!,"Played the original back in 2010 and played it again last week in preparation for AW2 after getting it on Black Friday.
The first game still holds up, for the most part, and still found it to be fun, thrilling experience despite some repetitive gameplay.

AW2, however, has absolutely blown me away and I’m only at the section where Saga is about to enter the other world through the float at Coffee World.

This game goes into territory that the first game simply implies. The mystery and intrigue is far more engrossing and compelling; the atmosphere is thicker and much more visceral; and the gameplay is beautifully expanded upon for both Saga and Alan and I love how each of their sections are so distinct from one another. I absolutely love how you feel like an actual detective with Saga and gathering and deducing information in the Mind Place so satisfying. Alan’s sections are wonderfully claustrophobic and brooding, and the ability to change plot threads is extremely clever.

Much like a great TV show, I tell myself I’m only gonna play for set amount of time only to keep pushing forward because every twist and added piece of info has me craving for more. This game is like the perfect mix between True Detective and Twin Peaks and I’m so excited to see where it goes.

Not to mention, the game genuinely feels scary at parts. The first game was more of a thriller with some intense moments, while this one has a lingering feeling of dread that’s nailed perfectly.

Basically, this is one of the greatest games I’ve ever played so far and I’m kicking myself for not playing it when it first came out.

My only wish is that I had a TV that has HDR. My TV is 4K but only has SDR. Even still, the visuals still pack a punch.

Bravo Remedy!

A friend suggested the Breville Café™ Roma Espresso Machine because it's $249 CAD (on sale for $169 CAD) and is a good starter machine.

I normally drink cappuccinos/lattes, about 2-3 shots worth of espresso daily (which I've been buying daily 💸). I don't need it for entertaining, and my partner drinks drip, so he's not involved.

My experience level is fairly novice, though I am highly experienced in cooking and baking so am comfortable around specialized equipment and machinery, and enjoy the precision required to get things right.

Counter space is definitely an issue, so the small size of this machine appeals to me. I've got a fairly tight budget for this line item at the moment, for complicated reasons. But I'm tired of paying for drinks constantly, and especially with winter, would rather be able to make coffee drinks at home.

We’re on the porch of a cozy house—one of those timeless places where the steps creak like old memories and the swing hums softly in the evening breeze. The sky is a canvas of gold and fire, and we’re there, painting it with laughter and shared stories. The kind of tales that weave themselves into your soul: travels that shaped us, mishaps that made us laugh, and quiet moments where no words were needed—just the warmth of each other’s company.

It’s not about grand adventures every day, but about finding magic in the ordinary—the way the sunset turns the edges of the world golden or how a shared silence can feel louder than words. Now, I’m here searching for the co-author of this future. Could it be you?

# A Little About Me

I’m a contradiction wrapped in curiosity. A writer of thoughts, a collector of sunsets, and a seeker of those fleeting moments that remind us how beautiful the world can be. Quiet at first, but if you’re patient, you’ll find someone who speaks in passions and listens like it’s the most important thing they could ever do.

Right now, I’m looking for **a friendship** that feels like the first chapter of a well-worn book—something natural, unforced, where we build a connection page by page. I believe the best stories begin with a spark of understanding, and maybe, just maybe, they grow into something more.

**Here’s what makes my story unique:**  
🎵 **Music as a Muse:** A future vinyl collector searching for a space, a lover of playlists that take you on a journey, and songs that feel like a warm hug. Music has a unique way of connecting moments, and I love finding the perfect soundtrack for every memory. Got a favorite song? Share it—I’m always ready to discover melodies that move you.  
🌍 **Adventure in My Veins:** Whether it’s chasing the perfect golden-hour light, wandering through unfamiliar streets, or hiking trails that lead to breathtaking views, I’m all about exploring the world—both near and far. Life’s too short not to follow the whispers of adventure.  
📚 **Wordsmith at Heart:** Writing is my way of capturing the fleeting and the unforgettable. I love playing with words until they reflect the emotions I can’t quite say aloud. And recently, I’ve been dabbling in photography—turning moments into memories through a lens.  
🕹️ **Low-Key Gamer:** When the world feels too loud, there’s something comforting about a quiet night in with a good game or a classic movie marathon.

# What I’m Looking For

I’m searching for someone who’s as curious about the world as I am—a woman who is kind at heart, sharp of mind, and carries a quiet strength that makes you want to know every story behind her smile. Someone who’s not just eager to explore the world around us but also willing to dive into the uncharted territory of creating a world together.

A partner in curiosity, someone who loves sharing dreams and building them into something real. Whether it’s small projects, grand adventures, or simply learning to navigate life’s challenges side by side, I want to create something unique with you—a shared journey filled with meaning, discovery, and connection.

# What Sets Me Apart

I see life as a tapestry of little details: the way sunlight dances on leaves, the rhythm of rain on a quiet afternoon, or the poetry of a shared moment that feels too good to end. I’ll notice the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love, and I’ll make a mental note of your favorite coffee order—not because I have to, but because I want to.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I’ll show up, not just in the big moments, but in the small ones too—the random text when I know you’re having a rough day, the laughter when you need a distraction, or simply being there when you feel like the world isn’t. The best stories aren’t about grand gestures; they’re about the quiet consistency of someone who’s truly there for you.

I’m also a romantic—not in the cliché way, but in the way that makes you feel seen. Sweet gestures, thoughtful words, and a knack for making everyday moments feel special. I’m the kind of person who’ll leave you a note in your favorite book, point out constellations during a midnight drive, or turn a casual Sunday into something unforgettable.

And when it comes to connection, I value honesty above all. If something’s on your mind, I’ll always want to hear it. Because real stories—the ones worth telling—are built on truth, not games.

# What About You?

Are you the kind of person who finds beauty in the cracks of everyday life? Who laughs easily, dreams deeply, and values honesty like a rare gem? Maybe you’re someone who savors both the quiet moments and the spontaneous ones—a cozy evening in or a bold adventure out.

Let’s start as friends, as kindred spirits who share an appreciation for the world’s quirks and wonders. Maybe we’ll swap stories, exchange playlists, or even embark on an adventure or two. And if the story decides to write itself into something more, we’ll let it—after all, the best tales often begin with an unexpected chapter.

If this resonates, let’s start the first line of what could be an unforgettable story. One filled with porch swings, golden sunsets, and the kind of connection that makes you believe in the magic of “what if.” Let’s see where the words take us.",1,1733325351.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

A little background, I do have low stomach acid which I know is a contributing factor for SIBO. And AFTER I started having heartburn (a known indicator for low stomach acid) I started taking betaine HCl. I take 3 to 4 capsules right now with a meal depending on how much protein I'm eating.

I'm tempted to upgrade to a new Classic Pro or similar but I'm really attached to the machine. It opened the rabbit hole for me.
Given that it's called a ""Gaggia Coffee"" it's difficult to Google. Does anyone have any experience with/opinions about this model vs a Classic? Ideally I'd like to improve it further but don't really know where to go next. Any ideas?",5,1733324475.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

this summer I noticed that it had started leaking

I told my boss about it and told him i'd fix the ma-

(for the special screws). I managed to locate the 
leak, it was one of the valves next to the bottom 
hot water pump. We ordered spare O-rings and valves,
i swapped them in, cleaned the brew unit (dipped it in hot water)
and the grinder of old coffee grind. As i was re-ass-
embling the machine, i didnt know how to set the gear
in the grinder so i just eyeballed it in the middle.

After I did all this, well, it's not leaking anymore
but it's giving very very short shots, previously it'd
give 4cl espressos, now something between one and two
centiliters. Also when i try to brew a long black 
it barely gives a shot worth of coffee. I've tried
setting the volume of the shots higher in the software
to no avail.

first of all I excuse myself for the english but i’m not from a english speaking country.
So basically I’m 18F and a month ago a new girl arrived in my school from the capital of my country,so she moved to my little city.
She is really beautiful and fun (from the little convos we had),and we share just a 2 hours class per week.
This monday we were having a law class,and we were talking about incapacity ecc,so i explained about the case of one of my closest friend who have a humor disturb,and how about my government help her economically.
Today the new girl during the pause came to me asking for a sigarette(we never talked out of the class)and after two minutes came again asking “can i ask you something?” laughing,so I said of course and she asked me “are you bipolar?”,i was a little bit shocked from the question but then i remembered about the Monday’s class,so i said to her that i wasn’t but one of my friend was.
She then proceeded in a really enthusiastic way to explain me that she was and she was really hoping to find someone who was bipolar because she wanted some advice,so i asked her a few questions but they were really confused.
She said that she has already been recovered a few time,but at the time she was sixteen and the doctor said that it was too soon to make a diagnosis,then she said that  her psychiatrist was already giving her bipolar’medication and that now she was in the maniacal phase and she was scared that she would show sign to the class and people will start to exclude her.
Of course i tried to been the most supportive possible,validating her feeling ecc she then asked me to take a coffee after school to talk about it and so i went.
After the moment she said that she was in maniacal phase i noticed that her eyes was looking like maniac one,so i felt like she was honest.
At the coffee by the way she showed me a screen of the list of medications she’s taking (i didn’t asked her it’s the first thing she started talking about),and the list was clearly from Chat GPT,then she asked me if in my opinion she have a  bipolar  disturb or another one,i honestly said that i was not a doctor and i couldn’t do the diagnosis of course.
Then she told me that she really feel like she is bipolar,but her doctor don’t want to do diagnosis even if he think too that she is.
I really don’t understand anything about this story and it feel really confusional,but i don’t think her story is really true,but this don’t exclude that she’s very kind and fun.

Figured some of you guys could maybe relate to this struggle I'm having. 

For quite a while many headmates in my system have been feeling very isolated and lonely because of not having friends like them or of their own age.

 It breaks my heart a bit cause when I was a little girl I also really struggled to make friends cause of trauma we were enduring and I know how much it sucks. 

We live in Scotland and there is just nothing here in regards to meet ups or support groups for people with CPTSD or DID to meet each other. 

Living in a rural area whilst being chronically ill adds another challenge cause there's not many places to meet up that aren't super busy or surrounded with people who vaguely know me (cause I want to have honest, deep conversations and feel unsafe doing so in busy public places). 

Our body is often exhausted and in pain majority of the time, I used to attend group activities in the Rape Crisis team around half an hour from me and made 1 good friend there - which I'm super grateful for - but my health is preventing me from travelling to the group anymore. The staff there were wonderful and even though they were specialised in DID they decided to do training on it and I'm very touched by that. I miss the companionship of the group a lot but I'm just too unwell to attend. 

 I'm still carrying around the guilt that my littles can't just go upto another child and make friends with them like they want to because we are in an adult body now and it just reads as creepy. 

I've often wondered if there's any other DID folk on this subreddit, and just in general, who also live in Scotland cause I feel so lonely and really struggle trusting people and knowing wtf to say because I feel like I'd sound SO boring a person! 

I'm not studying or in employment cause of all the mental crap and physical illness that has been caused by severe trauma throughout childhood. 

I used to have lots of hobbies and loved visiting coffee shops, visiting art galleries and museums, spending time in nature, swimming, doing crafts and would meet up and make connections with people cause of just being in Uni and I just feel shit how much chronic illness has robbed from me. 

I don't know if it's allowed for anyone to contact me on here but that would be really nice. ",3,1733324254.0,DID,1,1.0,False

so i just finished exams a few months ago and decided to take on a part time job to earn some money and pass time. so its my first time having a part time job, i was scared and wtv. so basically i just make coffee for ppl and on that day two receipts came in at once,one for packing croissants and one for the coffee. i started the coffee machine and prepared the coffee before i packed the pastry (like i was told to by my coworker) and after i was done packing the coffee machine finished dispensing water. when i put the pastry bag on the counter turns out the receipt was from the previous order and not hers. my coworker asked if it was hers or smt while i continued with the coffee and she said “are you serious u finally realised someone is waiting after 4 minutes” and like i said sorry and that woman rolled her eyes at me like wtf. fyi the coffee machine takes like three mins ish to dispense water cuz it’s kind of spoilt so not like if i didn’t pack the croissant i cld have been faster. anyway my coworker apologised too and that woman asked for my name to file a complaint or wtv. i literally bawled after that like ik it’s not a big deal but it’s my second day and i didn’t really think i did anything wrong i just felt at a lost and really angry. fortunately for me my coworkers were all really nice and told me that there are a lot of crazy people out that trying to comfort me. but the more i think about that woman the more i want to punch her. and also if i didn’t pack the croissants   wldnt she be more pissed that i wa standing infront of the coffee machine waiting for the water to dispense. i fr have no idea wtf she was mad about.

1h6huik,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/1h6huik/potential_contamination_by_roaches/,Potential contamination by roaches,"So, about a week ago I spotted a cockroach on our kitchen counter right next to the coffee machine. After talking to my husband we figured out we both actually spotted one or two baby roaches during the past couple of weeks (not realising they're roaches until I saw an adult). We immediately took precautions, chucked most of the food that has been opened and put the rest in a sealed box and contacted a professional to get rid of them. We're now staying with the in-laws until it's 100% roach-free. 

Now, I made some gingerbread cookies about 2 weeks ago, they're quite a lot of work to make. I left them on the counter for 1 night before putting them in a plastic bag on the window sill. 

I then moved them to the sealed box. It's been a week since we last ate them and no one got sick. But theoretically, roaches could have touched them about two weeks ago when they were left on the counter. BUT no one has been sick, it's been a week and since then the roaches couldn't have touched them. They also contain a lot of spices that I'm told roaches hate - like cinnamon, anise etc. 

I know the go-to advice is chuck them, if you're not 100% sure they're safe. But they really did take a lot of time and effort to make and I do think they should be safe, considering we ate them a week ago and are completely healthy and they contain the spices that roaches hate. Also, we caught the roaches super early and only ever saw a couple of them. They got to our apartment from the neighbours, apparently (that's what the exterminator said). 

So, what do you think? Are they safe to eat? ",1,1733323935.0,foodsafety,1,1.0,False
1h6hu46,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1h6hu46/pushback_when_i_try_to_deny_being_weighed_at_the/,Pushback when I try to deny being weighed at the doctors,"Howdy friends. I’m a 31 year old nonbinary person who’s been in recovery from restriction since 2018. I’m weight restored, finally have a good relationship with food and exercise, and am doing my best to work from a mindset of body-neutrality. I don’t find too much triggering these days, but being weighed sets me back like no other. In the height of my ED I would weigh myself a ridiculous amount, looking for any tiny change or fluctuation. I really settled into my recovery when I threw my scale out. I explain it to others that my brain cannot do the gymnastics required of a restrictive ED if I do not give it my weight. I can’t solve for X if Y is missing, the wheels in my brain can’t turn and calculate caloric intake vs output if I don’t give it the starting value. 

I’m also chronically ill. I avoid going to the doctor because I don’t want weighed, but I do have enough health issues that I need a yearly physical with bloodwork to keep an eye on things. Most of my physicians are in the same network, and all of them are pretty accommodating of my requests not to be weighed. One place asks for an estimated weight, and that works for me. However, my primary care physician gives me pushback every single time. The first few times I just went along with it and didn’t look at the scale. That was before I realized that the after-visit summary always has both my BMI, my weight, AND a little disclaimer about how I may want to talk to my doctor about diets or exercise etc. It affected me so much that I ended up cancelling several appointments with this doctor because I was not in a mental headspace to have to interact with my weight in that way. I ended up sending a MyChart message to the doctor and letting her know I was having issues with the nurse not listening to my requests. 

Her response was good! She said I can not consent to ANY procedure, and she would have a discussion with the nurse to prevent this moving forward. Amazing! 

Fast forward to today! I go in for my yearly physical. I’m nervous, I have the message pulled up on my phone to show the nurse in case she gives me pushback. She stops at the scale. “Oh, I actually don’t need weighed today!”

“It’s a physical. You can deny it at a regular appointment but not a physical. If you don’t want to see it, get on the scale backwards.”

“That’s counterproductive because you’re just going to hand me a paper that says it later.”

“I’ll tell the doctor to scratch it out.”

I ✨suppose✨ that’s a reasonable accommodation. So I comply. Even though stepping on a scale takes me RIGHT BACK to being in the thick of my ED. I always tear up as I step onto it. 

I tried to be polite after, I don’t want to seem like I’m mad at this lady for doing her job. Doctors appointment goes fine, I really like my doctor. As I go to walk out, what gets handed to me? The after visit summary. With my weight in bold letters. I’m glad I’m in an okay headspace today. I’m glad I was able to let myself sit in my car and have a quick cry, then evaluate how that number made me feel and how i can make sure I don’t allow it to influence my behavior. I had planned on going to the gym after my appointment and I’m skipping it because I am actively trying to not create a connection between seeing my weight and turning to ED behaviors. I’m getting myself a fun coffee on my way to work. I’m being kind to myself.

But why the FUCK is it so much to ask? I have communicated this request to two separate people within this office and it’s been blatantly ignored. I sent another message to my doctor, just to get clarification on if this is something they’re willing to do, or if I need to find a more trauma and eating disorder informed office to go to.

1h6hta8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h6hta8/neurodiverse_marriages_just_want_to_vent/,Neurodiverse marriages - just want to vent,"First off, this is not a ""I am getting divorce/on my last nerves"" type of post. Not at all. I am 41M and recognize that I have to ""handle my shit.""

I am ASD and ADHD, and my wife is more closer to neurotypical. However, I believe she is on the OCD scale. I'd say out of 10 she is like a 4. She doesn't believe she is but lately has been wondering about it because our oldest son is obviously OCD. He fixates on light switches and flicks them on/off repeatedly until the light dies.

For my part, after our first two kids were severely nonverbal autistic, I was basically like ""so wife, I should mention I think I am ASD and ADHD."" I did get evaluated and paid the $2 grand to do it. Yup, even with insurance. $2,000.

Anyways, my oldest son is like a 10/10 on autism and very OCD. I see in him the same things in me, just more so. He has emotional regulation problems to the point of physically hurting himself and attacking others when he is upset. I am not to that point but I've learned that when I get angry I should just ""lie down in bed for a while with my eyes closed."" Nothing good comes from those moments.

He has triggers, as do I. I can't stand it when people say things like ""yeah I checked the bag, its in there."" Then you check it and its not. I hate when people confidently say things that they shouldn't be as confident about. I would prefer ""I checked it but I am not sure, lets check again.""

I have a hard time not saying ""wtf is wrong with you"" when someone does that. Including my wife. She does it all the time. Her style of communication is much less direct than me and this drives me nuts.

For example, we had some work on our house done. She was the one responsible for telling the contractor what to do. He didn't do it right. I asked if she told him exactly and it turns out she just kindof assumed he'd know what she meant. I find that type of communication more ""typical"" and it drives me crazy.

For my part, she can't stand that I have problems with executive function. I need high doses of coffee to get things off a to do list. I've decided on that instead of a lifetime of taking the ADHD drugs they give adults (amphetamines btw). I have no doubt those would work but I read they also take years off your life and it gives you problems with exercise. Id rather not go that route.

I can't stand when she tells me to do a task, I start doing it, then interrupts to tell me 1-2 other tasks. I always, always have problems containing myself. I'm like ""wtf I told you I do NOT like it when people just dump things on me, wait until I am done this to tell me the next thing."" Its very real, if you give me a list of 3 things to do, I end up wandering aimlessly between the tasks and it is frustrating to everyone involved. Just tell me one at a time after each task is done. I can do one task well; two tasks not at all.

Her on the other hand? She's talking about the next 1-4 weeks and plans all the time. She will say ""on (date 2-3 weeks in the future) I will be doing to \_\_ at 7PM."" I'm like... ok? Why would I remember that? I don't even have my own plans that well thought out how am I going to remember yours? Just tell me like 1-2 days in advance at most. Telling me the morning of is fine. I don't care. Just telling me that far out is just like ""dammit another thing on the queue?""

My wife's OCD like behavior comes into play in things like the dish washer. She has a VERY peculiar way of doing almost everything. Like with laundry folding. I used to help her fold the kids clothes but if I didn't do it her exact way she'd re do it and tell me I am doing it wrong. It was like this 5 step folding process. I just said you know what, you do it then.

I handle all my own laundry - and I actually have to be vigilant about it because... she is OCD as F about putting things in the wash. Drop a sock on the floor? Laundry. She will take my clean clothes and dump it back in. So I have to keep it away and I have my own laundry bag and a strict ""leave my shit alone"" policy.

With the dishwasher she has such a strict way of loading it and again, if I do it wrong she just re does it and gives me shit about it. I will run it when she is asleep and my process is JUST as good and it only takes me like 5 mins to load it. She takes a lot longer than me because she has a way that just doesn't make sense.

In our previous home, we had a dishwasher downstairs. I had a second set of dishes that I mainly used (coffee mugs, some plates, etc) down there. I used that one to limit her complaining about my dish washer loading. The one we had in the kitchen broke and it took longer than expected to get replaced. I did 100% of the dishes for about 10 days and she was like ""wow, I didn't know you could do that.""

Its like, ""yeah you know? I've been doing my own dishes for about 10 years by the time we married just fine. Then apparently we get married and I load the dishwasher incorrectly.""

Before anyone goes ""ah typical husband and dishes."" You try it. You try doing dishes and folding laundry her way.

Anyways, it is interesting to see it in our kids. My oldest daughter is very definitely ADHD and ASD (also evaluated for ASD). I see her lack of focus as the same as mine. We have a tutor for her and we take her there and sit in the room with her for about an hour at a time. Everytime I've taken her, she is always looking over at me trying to get me to laugh at something she is doing.

Janet Shrugged (Atlas Shrugged).,"Janet sat in her modest but charming one-bedroom apartment, sipping oat milk from a sustainably sourced mug that said, “Tomorrow is a problem for Future Me.” She had just turned 35, the age at which the government (read: B\*#mers in government) seemed to believe every uterus-bearing citizen should spontaneously combust into a nursery. Instead, Janet had chosen to embark on The Great Shrug, her personal manifesto against cleaning up other people’s messes.

On the news, an elderly economist in a three-piece suit wailed about declining birth rates. “Who will pay for our pensions? Who will mow our lawns?” he cried, his jowls trembling like a bowl of unearned Social Security pudding. The ticker below him scrolled ominously: “BREAKING: Millennials and Gen Z Destroying Civilization with Low Fertility.”

Janet turned off the TV. “Destroying civilization? Oh no. Anyway.”

She opened her phone to check her favorite subreddit, r/TheYouthAreAlright\*\*,\*\* where the latest thread was titled, “Ayn Rand Would Be Proud of Us for Not Having Kids, Right?” The top comment was a manifesto:

“We’re simply applying market principles. B\*@mers made owning a home impossible, jacked up healthcare costs, and set the planet on fire. Why should we invest in their system? Let them reap the rewards of deregulated capitalism!”

Janet upvoted.

Later that afternoon, Janet walked into her local coffee shop—a minimalist haven decorated with plants in mason jars—and ordered her usual: a $7 oat milk latte, extra foam. Behind her, a silver-haired man in a “Retired but Not Expired” polo shirt muttered loud enough for her to hear: “These kids don’t know the value of a dollar. Seven bucks for coffee? Back in my day—”

Janet whirled around. “Back in your day, sir, you could buy a house for the cost of this latte. Please don’t confuse ‘value’ with your inability to grasp inflation.” The man gasped, clutching his chest, but Janet was already halfway out the door, latte in hand, shrugging all the way.

That night, Janet logged onto her favorite group chat, The Shrug Collective. Claire had just quit her tech job to start a kombucha empire, and Mike was crowdfunding to build a tiny house on wheels powered by solar panels and spite. The group’s most active member, Derek, announced he was going off-grid entirely after finding a parcel of land in Montana where he planned to barter goat cheese for Wi-Fi access.

“Derek,” Janet typed. “I don’t think you understand how Wi-Fi works.”

Derek responded with a GIF of a shrugging goat.

By year’s end, The Great Shrug had gone global. Janet watched with amusement as “Youth Workers of the World, Relax!” trended on social media. Instead of boycotting the system, her generation was outsmarting it. Claire’s kombucha business now ran a ""pay what you can"" scheme that only millennials understood. Mike’s solar tiny house had become the backdrop of a viral TikTok about escaping the rat race. Derek had somehow managed to exchange his goat cheese for an actual Tesla.

Meanwhile, a shadow economy emerged, run entirely by the youth. Apps like “Kidless” paired overworked Gen Zers with avocado farmers willing to trade guac for freelance design work. Someone had even created a ""B&$mer-Sitter"" service where Janet could pay teenagers to listen to retirees rant about the cost of stamps.

One night, Janet sat at her desk, drafting her own manifesto: “Let Them Eat Medicare: How I Learned to Stop Caring and Love the Shrug.” She chuckled as she imagined B#%mers demanding their pensions, only to be told, “Why don’t you just bootstrap your way into a better situation?” It was the ultimate karmic twist: the children of capitalism, refusing to be the custodians of its collapse.

In her dream that night, Janet was crowned Queen of the Shrug. She ruled over a kingdom where avocado toast was currency, and B\*@mers begged for asylum. Her throne was a beanbag chair, her crown a headband of solar-powered LEDs, and her royal decree was simple: “Clean up your own messes.”

I rarely get something from Black and White that I don't appreciate, however I was more than pleasantly surprised to find that the flavor profile was incredibly similar to Milky Cake.

So i just got prescribed ritalin la 20mg for the first time, i'm not completely sure if it's acually working.  
My blood pressure is not really any higher(120-80 is about the normal usually, the highest it got just by sitting around with meds is 135-87), i don't ""feel"" any different, i can even take a nap and sleep if i want to(also with cofee). I can feel the effects of 2 cups of coffee usually since i went down to 1-2 cups daily, but the meds is like nothing. 

  
I'm not completely sure that it isn't working either since i can kind of do things may be easier but not really sure (i mean like i'm writing this post, like actually started writing it and only doing that).

  
At the weekend i cleaned a ton of stuff, but again i can actually get hyperfocused on that sometimes, i'm not sure if i started it becouse of the meds or it's my regular ass cleaning hyperfocus.  
Also the other day i trained as hard as i could, but again that is what i wanted to and probably would have done anyway.  
Yesterday i just took a nap and woke up with more energy while on meds, again not sure if it's becouse or despite the meds.

I don't ""feel"" what i usually hear or read anywhere, none of the side effects that it should have(no thirst/appetite), nor the positives like enhanced focus(not that i even know what it actually feels like besides hyperfocusing). I might actually be doing things that i wouldnt otherwise, or just easier, like i just wrote all this in one sitting, but since i'm really curious wtf this should feel or be or whatever like i'd do it anyway.

tldr: Anyone has a good ""test"" to determine if the meds are actually working?",1,1733323502.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False
1h6hocu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h6hocu/the_curtain_call/,The Curtain Call,"As a theater major in college, it took me a while to land a solid job, but eventually, I found a position as a stage manager at an old theater in the heart of the historic district. This theater had been around since before television was even invented, and its marble floors and soaring, intricately designed ceilings made it a stunning, almost otherworldly place to work.

I drove up to the Gagel Theater early on my first training day, the excitement of starting a new job mixing with the familiar anxiety of the unknown. The road was empty at that hour, and I found myself driving through the misty streets, the headlights casting long, eerie shadows along the pavement. I stopped at a gas station on the way to grab a stale cup of coffee and a protein bar—nothing fancy, just something to wake me up.

The rain from the night before hung heavy in the air, and the asphalt glistened with puddles beneath a gray sky. I parked behind the theater, its gothic facade barely visible through the morning fog. The weight of the building settled on me as I stepped out, its mysterious presence heightened by the chill in the air. I shrugged it off, grabbed my bag, and walked toward the entrance, my footsteps echoing in the empty lot.

Inside, the warmth was a welcome relief from the dampness outside. The air smelled of old velvet, dust, and a faint metallic scent, like remnants of past performances. The lobby was grand, with ornate molding and polished marble floors gleaming under chandeliers. An abandoned ticket booth and tarnished concession stand hinted at the theater’s forgotten past, frozen in time.

I paused to take it all in, the silence broken only by my footsteps, the sound of sharp shoes clicking on stone grew louder. ""Mr. Allen?"" a voice called from around the corner.

I turned, and there he was—a man so impeccably dressed he could’ve stepped out of a fashion magazine. His bald head gleamed under the dim lights, and a black-dyed goatee framed his angular face. He wore a tailored suit so expensive it made my second-hand clothes feel like a joke. His name tag, gold-plated and pristine, read William Kersey - Gagel Theater Manager.

""Yes, sir,"" I replied, stepping forward and extending my right hand for a handshake, trying to match his professional air.

But Kersey didn’t acknowledge my hand. Instead, he walked directly up to me with the kind of confidence that only comes from someone who has been in charge for a long time. His eyes were sharp, calculating, as if he had already sized me up the moment I walked through the door. Without missing a beat, he spoke in a low, smooth voice, his words deliberate.
“Welcome to Gagel Theater,” Kersey said, his eyes briefly scanning the lobby behind me as though he were assessing something unseen. 
I pulled my hand back awkwardly, feeling his detachment. It wasn’t rude, just off-putting—he wasn’t here to make me comfortable, but to assert control.

With a theatrical sweep of his hand, he motioned to the theater. “Let me show you around. Your supervisor and the Director will be here soon.” His tone, polite but authoritative, made it clear this was more of a formality than an invitation.

I followed, trying to shake off the unease creeping up my spine. A tough boss didn’t bother me, but something about Kersey’s behavior made me feel like he was always in charge.

He led me through the building’s halls, pointing out offices, bathrooms, and the break room. His words were mechanical, like he’d given this same tour a hundred times. He paused by a display, turning to face me with a grin. “Every employee should appreciate the history and legacy of where they work, don’t you agree?”

I forced a smile. “Yes, sir.”

He abruptly gestured toward a wall display—a shrine to the theater’s history. Behind glass were framed photos of past actors, some unrecognizable, others glamorous, each with plaques detailing their contributions. “This theater has been running since 1905,” Kersey said, sweeping his hand toward the images. “Hundreds of performances, thousands of audiences.”

I nodded, feeling a strange unease as I studied the old photos. They were more than tribute—they felt almost reverential. Kersey motioned toward the oldest photo. “We’ve made many improvements over the years.” The comparison between the humble beginnings of the theater and its modern grandeur was stark, but something about the display made the history seem distant and unsettling.

I glanced at Kersey, who stood with perfect posture, smiling at the photos with an intensity that felt off. I shook off the discomfort, reminding myself I was here to work, not to unravel the theater’s mysteries.

Just then, Kersey’s smile twitched as he glanced behind me. “Mr. Allen, this is your supervisor, Troy.”

I turned to meet Troy, a man in his mid-twenties with curly hair tied back and dressed all in black. He greeted me with a firm handshake and a friendly smile. “Nice to meet you, Denis,” he said, his tone warm. His eyes flicked to Kersey, who stood by the display, still observing us. “Are you done with the history lesson? We open in two weeks.”

Kersey sighed, as if Troy had interrupted something important. “Of course,” he said coolly, then gave me a tight smile. “Welcome to Gagel,” he added before walking away with his usual air of authority.

Troy’s expression softened once Kersey was out of earshot. “Sorry I was late to save you from his speech. He loves to hear himself talk.” He gave a conspiratorial grin, but it wasn’t unkind, just casual.

I chuckled nervously. “It wasn’t that bad,” I said, trying to sound casual. “He wasn’t too bad.”

Troy gave a half-smile, clearly not buying it, but he didn’t press the point. “Well, he can be a bit much. But, I’ll save you from more of that. Come on,” he said, gesturing toward the theater's inner sanctum. “Follow me. You haven’t seen the stage yet, have you?”

I shook my head. The tour so far had mostly been the administrative side of things, and the closest I’d gotten to the theater was standing in the hallway outside the main stage entrance. “No, I haven’t had a chance to see it yet,” I replied, trying to mask my curiosity. I was more than eager to get a closer look at where I’d be spending most of my time.

Troy led the way, his pace quick but relaxed, and I fell in step beside him as we passed through the corridors. The deeper we went into the theater, the quieter it became, as if the building itself was holding its breath. The heavy air of history seemed to thicken the farther we went, like the walls were absorbing the weight of decades of performances, both celebrated and forgotten.

He gave me a sideways glance as we reached a large, creaking door that led to the backstage area. “Don’t let Kersey scare you off,” Troy said with a half-smile. “He can be a little intense, but he means well. Just… a little obsessed with this place.”

“I can tell,” I said, letting a light laugh slip out.

Troy nodded, then pushed the door open, the scent of dust and old wood immediately filling the air. “Alright, this is where the real work happens,” he said, stepping aside to let me enter. I peered into the dimly lit space, where the edges of the stage seemed to emerge from the shadows like an old, forgotten memory.

The backstage was just as I’d imagined—dark, cramped, and filled with the remnants of countless performances. Ropes and pulleys hung from the ceiling, and old props were strewn about haphazardly, as if left in a rush. The faint smell of paint and aging fabric filled the air. My eyes were drawn to the towering set pieces that loomed in the dim light, their outlines shifting in the gloom.

Troy took a few steps into the space, gesturing to the various areas. “This is where you’ll spend most of your time,” he said. “The crew’s all up here—setting lights, adjusting props, making sure everything’s in place before the curtain goes up.” He glanced over his shoulder with a small smirk. “It’s not glamorous, but it’s where all the magic happens.”

I couldn’t help but be excited. This was the kind of place I’d dreamed about—messy, chaotic, yet full of life in its own way. It wasn’t the clean, polished front of the theater where the audience would sit. This was the heart of the production, where things were built and broken, where the real work took place.

I walked to the center of the stage, the darkness swallowing me whole. The theater was empty, and its vastness seemed to stretch forever, the air thick with the smell of old wood and dust. I could almost hear the whispers of the past, the faint echoes of performances long gone, lingering in the silence. It was a place where dreams had lived and died, where lives had been changed, and now, it was mine to explore. The thrill of it all—the possibilities of being part of something so much bigger than myself—made my heart race. This was going to be the start of an exciting chapter in my life.

Troy slapped me on the shoulder, breaking my thoughts. “The cast is rehearsing for Chicago during Tech week. They’re off-script, running through everything. You won’t be alone—we’ve got another stagehand to help you,” he said easily.

I nodded, distracted by the vastness of the space. Troy started walking away, heading toward the light console. “It’ll be easier to show you everything with the lights on,” he called back.

Alone on the stage, I felt the weight of the empty theater. The silence was almost suffocating. I remembered hearing that, from the stage, you can’t see the audience because of the bright lights. In this massive theater, Troy had already disappeared from view, and the darkness seemed to swallow me.

I walked over to the velvet curtains, and when I touched them, I felt a strange hum, like they were alive. The fabric was warm—unnaturally so. I shook it off as just the air conditioning, but unease lingered.
Suddenly, the lights blazed on, nearly blinding me. “Damn it,” Troy’s voice echoed. “Sorry, should’ve warned you.”

I laughed it off, stepping back from the curtains. Troy came up the stage with surprising agility. “Let me get you a script Denis.” Troy said, his grin playful.

I nodded. “Yes, sir.”

“Don’t call me that,” Troy said with a smirk. “But first, let me show you the ropes.”

As we moved toward the back of the stage, I couldn’t resist asking, “Hey, Troy, what’s up with the curtains? They were... humming.”

He paused, looking at them with a strange tension in his face. “I’ve wondered that myself, but never cared to check. It’s just one of those things.” His expression darkened. “My old supervisor once told me something,” he said, lowering his voice. “Never open the curtains after a performance. Don’t touch them after they fall.”

I thought he was joking. “Like no one’s allowed backstage after a show?”

“No,” he replied, serious now. “It’s... different. Sounds crazy, I know, but he was clear—never touch the curtains once they fall after the cast bows.”
The air grew heavier, colder. I tried to brush it off. “Just a superstition, right? Like saying Macbeth?”

Troy gave a tight smile. “Probably. But still, don’t open them after the show. Promise?”

I nodded, trying to laugh it off. “I won’t, don’t worry.”

He gestured to the notes on the wall. “Alright, let’s get to work.”

Those first weeks with Chicago were exciting—learning the ropes, working behind the scenes, the thrill of being part of something bigger. But now, I wish I’d listened more closely to Troy’s warnings.

It was opening night for Chicago, and I was a nervous wreck. The adrenaline was buzzing in my veins, my hands slightly trembling as I gripped my clipboard. I was dressed in all black, the uniform of the stage crew, and my earpiece was snug in place, the faint hum of static filling my ear. The cast was in full swing—rehearsing lines, running through their dance routines, and sipping on warm tea to soothe their throats before the big show. The energy backstage was palpable, a mixture of excitement and nervous anticipation that seemed to vibrate through every corner of the theater.

Troy wasn’t around tonight. He trusted me to handle the production solo, which, while comforting, only added to the pressure. It felt like the entire show rested on my shoulders, but there was pride in that too. He trusted me, and I was doing well. That thought gave me a boost—maybe I was finally proving myself in this intimidating world of theater.

But before I could enjoy the moment, the intercom blared. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Chicago!” The voice was unmistakable—William Kersey.

His presence always set my nerves on edge. There was something about the forced friendliness in his voice, the arrogance he exuded like he owned everything, especially the Gagel Theater. I could almost see him out there, strutting across the stage in his expensive suit, relishing the attention. It made me want to roll my eyes, but I couldn’t afford distractions—it was opening night.

I peeked out from the wings, my heart racing as I scanned the packed house. It was a sight I’d dreamed of but never fully expected. The audience, dressed in everything from formal attire to casual clothes, was eager for the show to begin. The air was thick with excitement and nerves—an exhilarating chaos that made me feel like I was part of something important.

Then my attention shifted to a man sitting in the front row. He stood out—a large glass of brandy in hand, his posture slumped, and a glazed look in his eyes. He seemed too relaxed, like he’d already indulged too much before the show even started. His presence was unsettling, the kind of drunken calm that felt out of place.

The bright lights stung my eyes, and Kersey’s voice echoed through the theater again, repeating his rehearsed speech about the history of the Gagel Theater. I gripped the velvet curtain, trying to steady myself amidst the growing unease.

As soon as my fingers touched the curtain, a wave of disgust hit me. It wasn’t the soft texture I expected—it was slick, wet, and slimy, like squeezing a soaked washcloth. My heart raced as I pulled my hand away, but the liquid clung to my palm, stretching out in sticky strands. The fabric wasn’t just damp; it was soaked, glistening unnaturally, almost alive. The familiar hum of the theater felt heavier now, vibrating through the walls, like the curtains were breathing.

Confusion twisted into dread as I stared at my hand, covered in a slick, spit-like residue. A rancid, rotten smell filled the air, making me gag. What had happened to the curtains? They had been fine this morning. Had someone spilled something on them? I needed to tell Kersey, but something about this felt off—like the curtains were waiting for something.

Kersey’s voice snapped me out of my thoughts, announcing the start of the show with his usual flair. The audience cheered, but the sound was distant, muffled. I wiped my hand on my pants, the sticky residue still there, clinging to me as I stepped back. I glanced at the curtain again, but all I could see was that strange, unnatural sheen. The theater felt... wrong.

As the show began, everything went flawlessly—each note from the orchestra, each line delivered perfectly. The audience was captivated, their applause growing louder with every act. The energy was intoxicating, but underneath it, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the theater itself was holding its breath.
Backstage, I was busy coordinating quick costume changes and shifting set pieces, feeling like a vital part of a well-oiled machine. Everything flowed seamlessly, the crew working in perfect rhythm, and the energy of the show buzzed through the building. It was exhilarating to be part of something bigger than myself.

As the final act ended, the music swelled, and the cast took their bows. The audience stood, applauding, and the excitement in the room was electric. I hovered over the button to lower the curtain, one simple motion to end the night. But as I stood there, a strange unease washed over me.

The cheers sounded muffled, distant, like I was hearing them through water. My mind flashed to earlier—the damp, oily sensation on the curtains, the hum they emitted, and Troy’s warning: "" Never open the curtains after a performance. Don’t touch them after they fall."" I had brushed it off, but now, that warning echoed in my mind, and the feeling that something was wrong settled deep in my bones.
The applause continued, but I hesitated, hand poised over the button. The hum of the curtain seemed to vibrate through the walls, sending a chill through me. I swallowed hard, struggling to push aside the growing sense of dread. Something about this moment felt off.

Finally, I clicked the button, and the curtain began its slow descent, moving as if reluctant to end the evening. As I moved backstage to join the cast, I caught sight of a drunken man stumbling toward the stage. His unsteady steps and flushed face made it clear he’d had too much to drink.

“Wait, sir!” I called, stepping forward. “You can’t come up here.”

But he ignored me, climbing onto the stage as the audience murmured in confusion. With the curtain halfway down and tension rising, all eyes shifted between the man and the retreating performers.

“Jerry, get back here!” I heard a woman shout from the front row. She was reaching toward him, her voice strained, but it seemed to have no effect. He barely seemed to hear her, too drunk to comprehend her words. 

He mumbled incoherently, and then I heard the words that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up:
“Show must go on. Show must go on.”

His voice was hoarse, like a chant, something mechanical in the repetition.

“Sir,” I said, my voice firmer now as I stepped forward, stepping under the descending curtain. My hand reached out, palm open, as I tried to keep the drunken man away from the set. “We can’t have you on stage like this.”

But just as I was about to reach him, a hand shot out of nowhere, grabbing my shoulder with brutal force. I was yanked back, my feet sliding on the stage as I spun to face the person who had stopped me. It was William Kersey. His eyes were fixed on the man now stumbling further onto the stage, and his gaze was... wrong. 

There was a sadness there, something cold and distant, like he was watching a final act unfold.
“What are you doing?” I exclaimed, trying to shake off his grip. I pulled myself away from him, but his eyes never left the drunken man, who was now mumbling louder, as if in a trance.

“Show must go on…” he slurred again, his voice growing louder and more frenzied, though his body seemed to be losing control.

And then, without warning, the man tripped, collapsing onto the stage with a violent thud. His body hit the aged wood with a sickening crack, and the audience gasped. I winced at the sound, horrified by his fall. He lay there motionless, sprawled on the floor.

I was about to rush forward, to drag the man off the stage myself and call the police, but before I could take another step, William’s hand shot out again, this time grabbing mine.

“Mr. Allen,” he said, his voice low and urgent, yet strangely calm. “It’s no use now. Don’t open that curtain. Please. You don’t deserve it.”

I stared at him, confused. What was he saying? My hand trembled as I looked back over at the fallen man, still lying there, tangled in the folds of the curtain that had finally reached the stage floor. The red velvet had covered him entirely, swallowing his body in its luxurious fabric. 

William’s grip on my hand tightened. His eyes didn’t leave the curtain, but there was something dark in his expression now, something unreadable. “Please, Mr. Allen,” he murmured. “Do not open the curtain. There are things behind it you don’t want to see.”

I swallowed hard, my chest tightening. Something inside me screamed to open the curtain, to see what was really going on. But a deeper instinct held me back. What had Kersey seen? What had he witnessed? The fear in his eyes, the way he spoke... It was like he already knew what would happen if I did.

The atmosphere was thick with confusion, yet the chaos of the audience seemed to dissipate in an instant. I stood there, my mind racing, as I watched them trickle out of the theater. The same audience that had been shouting for the drunken man to get down from the stage—now quietly filing out, just like they were leaving any other performance after the final curtain call.

I noticed the woman who had screamed for Jerry to return to his seat. She was walking calmly toward the exit, completely alone, as if nothing out of the ordinary had just happened. She didn’t even glance back toward the stage.

It was then I noticed William Kersey. He was walking briskly toward the lobby, heading to speak to the audience as if nothing had happened. His back was turned to me, his shoulders stiff with a purpose. A sense of urgency hung in his every step. His departure left me alone backstage, the weight of the silence pressing down on me like a physical force. The air felt thick, suffocating.

I was left standing there, unsure of what had just transpired. The curtain... the man... had I imagined the whole thing? My fingers reached out and touched the curtain again. This time, the fabric was dry—completely dry, as dry as the first time I had brushed against it. No strange slime, no warmth. It was almost... normal. Almost. Yet, beneath the surface, I could still feel it—the hum, the subtle vibration that pulsed through the fabric like something alive.

I waited for the drunken man to emerge, expecting him to crawl out from beneath the velvet folds. Perhaps he had passed out under there. Maybe he was unconscious, but surely, he wasn’t dead. But there was no movement. No sound. The curtain lay still, like an impenetrable wall of red.

I moved about the backstage area, cleaning up the remnants of the night, but I couldn’t keep my eyes off the stage. I kept looking toward the center, where the man had fallen, half-expecting to see some sign of life. A hand. A foot. A twitch. But there was nothing. Just the silent, ominous weight of the stage pressing in on me.
When I reached the front console to switch off the lights, the weight of the night’s bizarre events pressed down on me. Each fragment of the evening replayed in my mind like a haunting loop I couldn’t escape. Had the curtain… crushed him? Was Jerry—was he dead beneath that heavy velvet? Or had I imagined it all, a trick of the mind, some fevered hallucination brought on by exhaustion? I tried to push the thoughts away, tried to anchor myself in logic, to dismiss the gnawing sense of dread coiling tighter in my chest. But no matter how hard I tried, the unease stayed with me, clawing at my ribs, cold fingers tightening around my heart.

And then, like a cruel answer to my spiraling questions, the curtain moved.

It wasn’t slow or tentative, like the controlled descent it had made earlier in the night. No. This was something else. Something darker. The velvet began to lift—not slowly, not carefully, but fast—too fast for something so heavy. It wasn’t just parting; it was unfurling, unraveling, as if some unseen force on the other side was pulling it apart. It rose with the predatory grace of a monstrous creature stretching awake from a long slumber. The dark fabric rolled back, revealing the stage behind it—a gaping maw framed by the harsh glare of the stage lights, their cold glow flashing like teeth, sharp and hungry.

Behind the curtain, the stage was empty. But the air—God, the air—was thick with something wrong. I squinted into the darkness, seeing nothing but the clutter of props and the forgotten ropes hanging lifeless from the rafters. The brick wall loomed at the back of the stage, silent and indifferent. Yet, there was something else, something wrong in the air, a faint sound that shouldn’t have been there. It was a scream. No, not a single scream, but a chorus—distant, muffled, as though they were coming from far beneath the stage or maybe the very bowels of the building itself.

At first, I thought it was just the building settling, the old pipes groaning, maybe the sound of traffic echoing off the distant streets. But no. As the curtain continued its unsettling rise, the screams grew clearer—more defined. Like the last, desperate cries of something or someone long lost. I froze, unable to tear my gaze away from the widening space, my breath thick in my throat, my heart slamming against my chest.

The man—Jerry—was gone.

I scanned the stage, my eyes darting frantically across the bare boards, the orchestra pit yawning dark below. There was no sign of him. Not a trace. Not a drop of blood. Not a shred of his clothes, no hint of him left behind. It was as if he’d never been there at all. The empty stage stood silent, its hollow emptiness pressing in on me from all sides. The curtain, now still, hung in the air like a watchful eye, its fabric undisturbed. I was alone, but the lingering echo of those screams… they stayed with me, clawing at the edges of my sanity.

And then, in the silence, the curtain shuddered—just a tiny movement.
As though it knew I was still watching.
A wave of panic slammed into me, raw and unrelenting, like a fist to the chest. My heart raced, my breath shallow and frantic. Every instinct screamed at me to run, to get away, but my body betrayed me, frozen in place, locked in some kind of nightmare. I turned abruptly, my fingers numb and shaking as they scrambled to find the switch.

The lights died, plunging the theater into a suffocating darkness, but it didn’t matter. The building wasn’t quiet. The silence that surrounded me now felt wrong. Heavy. Like something—no, someone—was lurking in the shadows, waiting for me to slip, waiting for the moment when I’d lose control. The air itself was thick, charged, as though the very walls of the theater were closing in on me. The curtains—those cursed, wretched curtains—loomed in the blackness like a sentient thing, watching, waiting.

My legs felt like lead, each step an effort, as if some invisible force was dragging me back, pulling me deeper into whatever nightmare this place had become. Still, I forced myself to move, to leave the stage behind. 
Finally, the door loomed ahead, the faint light from the street spilling through the cracks beneath it. I swung it open, nearly stumbling into the cool embrace of the night air. The shift from suffocating darkness to the chill of the outside world was jarring, but it didn’t comfort me. 

I turned my face to the sky, trying to fill my lungs with the freshness of the night, hoping the cold would clear my head, shake off the weight that clung to me like a shadow. But it didn’t help. It only made the world feel more distorted, more off. The night seemed to stretch on, unbroken, endless. The sound of distant traffic was muted, as though the world had pressed its palms to its ears, trying to drown out whatever was stirring just beyond the reach of my senses.

I swallowed, trying to regain control of my racing thoughts, but the feeling of eyes on my back—of something just out of reach, just beyond my perception—didn’t fade. Instead, it grew, spreading like a dark stain across the edges of my mind. Something was waiting. Something had been waiting for far too long.
But when I stepped onto the sidewalk, I froze.

The woman—the woman who had been sitting with Jerry—was standing near the street, staring off into the distance. There was no sign of Jerry. No one else was with her. She was alone.

I approached her, my voice hesitant as I asked, “Hello, ma’am. Was that man Jerry with you?”

She turned to look at me, her eyes distant, as if she didn’t quite understand what I was saying. “What are you talking about?” she asked, her tone confused. “I don’t know anybody named Jerry.”

My breath caught in my throat. I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. She couldn’t have forgotten him—could she? She had been shouting his name only an hour before. I watched her for a moment longer, trying to read the blank expression on her face, but there was no recognition, no flicker of memory.

Was she pretending? Had the whole audience been pretending? Had they somehow all forgotten Jerry’s presence on stage, his drunken stumble, the fall, and the strange silence that followed?

And then I felt it. The heavy weight of the stage is still clinging to my thoughts. The curtains. The way they had seemed almost alive, as if they were waiting for something. The vibrations. The hum. The heat. All of it flooding back to me in a moment of sheer panic.

The voice of William Kersey echoed in my mind, chilling me to the bone: “You don’t deserve it.”

What did he mean by that? 
I turned, desperate to escape the unsettling feeling creeping up my spine, but the question lingered, gnawing at me. I had no answers. All I had were the strange words Kersey had spoken, the eerie emptiness of the stage, and the haunting memory of the curtain opening on its own, revealing nothing.

Months passed before I would ever truly understand what he meant. And now I wish to God I heeded his words.

She has kids the same age as mine, so had good conversations. Been going to this class for over an year now and I see her often. We always have a short chat after the class. She invited me to her place for coffee/playdate. The kids were getting along well. We also had a great time chatting together. She wanted to meet again and asked if they can come over to our place. We fixed a date and she was so excited to meet up. She texted me later to get the address and said they were so excited to meet us again. 2 days back I wanted to confirm if she was coming, no reply. Yesterday I wrote to her again. Completely ghosted. Today morning, she posts some statuses doing fit check, her Christmas tree, looking Completely OK. Couldn't she take a second to say she can't make it? I was so confused if they'd meet us or is she cancelling the appointment. I don't even understand why she suddenly didn't want to come inspite of fixing a time and date. Why not inform prior so that I could've done something else with the kids instead of preparing everything and waiting for them.",1,1733323457.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

What’s it like returning to work after a long holiday weekend? Well, I dropped ashes into my freshly brewed coffee. I tried to scoop out the invaders, but it was no good. Every sip tasted a little smokey. Totally forgot to swap out the Vanilla Bean coffee pod in the machine for my second cup. Shit. Never a good sign to start the week 0 for 2. Third time was the charm. The smell of freshly brewed coffee is what gets me out of bed every morning. The first sip wakes up my entire body. We back. And fully loaded. Hang on. The caffeine is moving quickly. We’re going to jump around here. Let’s start with the holiday travel season.

The American Automobile Association (AAA) boasted that nearly over 80 million people would travel over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Well, speaking to a co-worker who traveled, the airports were empty. Not dinky ones either. I’m talking LAX and Dallas-Fort Worth. Her plane was filled just 20%. Interestingly, first-class was almost completely booked. It was the cabin that was empty. If that doesn’t paint a clear picture of the current state of our economy, I’m not sure what will. But due to weight and physics, some first-class passengers had to be scattered in the cabin of the plane. This ensured the flying aluminum tube wouldn’t fall out of the sky from uneven weight distribution. Let’s say there were many grumpy rich people in the skies this holiday. And I won’t lie. That brings a smile to my face.

Post holiday news stories celebrated how there were more travelers this year since 2019, showing a return to normalcy. Maybe that’s true, but I didn’t see it. Or hear about it. I don’t mean to pick on the media, but they collectively need to do better. They have one of the hardest and broadest jobs in America, sure, but our democracy depends on their dissemination of information. It’s why when the news produces segments that are advertisements, it drives me into a frenzy. Over the holiday, local ABC stations around the country promoted their parent company’s movie like it was breaking news. Moana 2 is cool and all, but is a movie opening really worthy of a two-minute segment on a half-hour local news program? Do people even go to the movies? Is that what the American people need to hear about, another half-baked Disney sequel?

Somehow, that wasn’t the worst cultural crime committed by the mass media during the long Turkey Day weekend. Every TV station covered Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Literally every. Many called out specific businesses and what shoppers could get a discount on. How is this news? Getting a good deal is important, but is that really what should be on the news? How is that informing anyone? All that does is direct Americans where to go to spend their money. American journalism in 2024, nothing but news readers and digital retail circulars.

Even worse, every year the holidays come sooner and sooner. Black Friday and Cyber Monday were once limited to two days of sales. Act now or wait until next year. Now? It’s mutated into two weeks of targeted advertisements. Halloween starts in August. Christmas? First day of November. Black Friday? Soon to coincide with Good Friday. Jesus saves all, even you… from everyday prices.

Speaking of the absurdity of America, if your enemy committed the same actions as your friend, how would you view it? How would a Trump supporter view the pardoning of Hunter Biden by his father, the President? Hate it. Obviously. Now, how would they feel if Trump pardoned his son for the same alleged offenses? How does it make you feel? Are your thoughts and feelings consistent? Or do you have bias? Online the pardon is getting nothing but love. People saying, “Trump is making bad cabinet picks, Trump did this, or that, and he’s going to weaponize the DOJ and go after Hunter.” (Strange considering “weaponizing the Department of Justice” is the same thing Republicans accused the Biden administration of doing. Can we at least get new material, please? This recycled shit is boring.)

Hunter should not have been pardoned. Joe Biden has repeatedly said he wouldn’t do it. A father will always protect his son, but this is an abuse of power. If you or I were convicted by a jury of our peers over numerous federal gun charges as Hunter, would we have a Get Out of Jail Free Card? Why should the President’s son? That’s “rules for thee, not for me” playing out in real-time folks. You may hate Donald Trump, but that doesn’t make Joe Biden good.

But Trump isn’t innocent here, either. Sure, he chose not to pardon his children, unlike Joe, but did pardon his in-law, and then a few years later appointed him the Ambassador to France. Nepotism? Abuse of power? Helping the fam? Not cool.

Trump was also convicted of multiple felonies. I hate how Trump’s court cases are going away because of his new job. Witch hunt or Trump worming his way out of justice again? Whether the Bidens or Trump, we may never know the truth. The issue here is that people across the country are justifying corruption, abuse of power, and allowing potential criminals to influence our nation’s policies. This shows ego-centric conclusions or an inability to think critically. All sides are guilty of this crime, so don’t point fingers saying he did this, so we did this. It’s childish. Grow up. We tribalize, believing our side is right good and the other side is always wrong regardless of facts. This isn’t about who is worse. It’s about recognizing that ALL politicians manipulate the system to their advantage. This is bigger than Biden or Trump, Republican or Democrat. It’s about the dangerous precedent we’re setting when we justify corruption because it aligns with “our team.” We’re in a really dangerous place, America. I’m not sure where we go next.

\- - -

That was the quote that lingered in my mind. I saw it once—on a TV screen during a mental health awareness ad, which played after the show I was absentmindedly watching had ended. It stayed with me, I pondered how powerful our minds can shape our reality. The thoughts we think, beliefs we share, and our perceptions of reality aren't merely passive but actively influence how we experience and interact daily.

It had me thinking, that despite everyone living in the same physical world, billions of individual realities, cultivated by billions of other people co-exist under one shared present, does that make sense?

But what do I know? I was just a college student trying to figure things out, I still am. Truth be told, I wasn't even sure I was in the right course, so I'm fairly certain that no one should be taking my thoughts seriously about existential views regarding mankind.

Brushing off my odd late-night philosophicals, my head shifted to more important and delicious concerns—what to eat for dinner. I thought about ordering Chinese food but quickly disregarded it, due to the need to save money for my car payment, which I've been paying off since last year.

So, I settled for the next best thing—ramen noodles.

They weren't so bad—actually, not bad at all. It hit the spot for me. It might not be everyone's ideal hearty meal, but it was good enough for me.

Shortly after, I then washed the dishes, something I had done countless times—whether in the afternoon or, more often, at night. Though, the time of day didn't matter, as in front of the sink, there was this window. It wasn't an ordinary window used for admiring the view or scenery outside; its sole purpose was to expel fumes from the kitchen when someone cooked.

It stretched the full length of the sink to the drain board, with a built-in exhaust fan just above the handle. You could open the window slightly, but it wouldn't slide all the way down; it could only open halfway before being held back by the hinge.

When I peered out, all I could see was darkness—pitch black, apart from my darkened reflection. You wouldn't even know there was an identical window on the opposite side if it weren't for the rare moments when workers opened the ventilation during the day, letting in just enough light to reveal the various windows lining the vertical space from top to bottom. To me, It looked more like an empty elevator shaft than anything else, but except for elevator doors it had windows.

Well, I guess I am partially to blame in choosing where to live in the building, when I did a quick tour of the vacant spaces, I chose the one with an ominous window, instead of an apartment with a kitchen that didn't face a black void. Sure, I could've splurged for a better space with a scenic view, or a better building in general, but that was out of the question. I was on a tight budget, and a good view wasn't exactly a priority standard at that time.

That night, when it came time for me to wind down and get ready for bed I saw from my living room window that it was pouring rain outside, that explained the pitter-pattering I kept hearing as I had dinner, but paid no mind to. I watched the street, empty and desolate in the dead of night as the heavy rain poured on the pavement and the lifeless road, how the droplets of rain flowed with the direction of the strong winds blowing through the air, the trees swaying its leaves and branches along the gushing winds, it was then made clear to me it wasn't just a heavy rainy night, outside before me was a storm in place.

I felt taken aback by the sudden alarm that emitted from my phone, the sounds of panicked sirens repeatedly ringing from inside the phone's speaker, as the phone's LED light illuminated my dimly-lit features, my brows furrowed as I read;

. . .

*9:32 PM*

'Emergency Alert'

**National Weather Service:** A STORM SURGE WARNING is in effect for Richmond, VA until 4:00 AM. Take action now to protect life and property. Avoid flood-prone areas.

. . .

I looked out the window once more at the empty, desolate streets, saturated by the storm's relentless rain. The rainwater cascaded down the street, flowing over the pavement in sheets. It was obvious that the storm wasn't going to let up anytime soon. As I lay in bed, the steady rhythm of the rain took on a surprisingly therapeutic quality, offering a strange sense of calm amidst the storm's fury.

I felt truly at peace for a moment. The rain's pitter-patter had grown louder compared to earlier, when I barely noticed it. With my head nestled snugly on the pillow, I tried to surrender to sleep, letting the gentle rhythm of the rain lull me into a deep, restorative slumber, enjoying one of the best rests I had in quite some time.

Later that week, as early December settled in, my air-conditioning started to leak, well it had began leaking the morning after the storm, thus I had to keep a bucket underneath, and upon testing its functions I came to a realization that it had broke during the night. Fortunately, winter made the lack of cooling less of an issue, though the building manager had ghosted my text.

At some point black spots began to grow on the grills, dark, jagged blotches creeping across the metal, resembling ink bleeding through paper, though I tried cleaning, but it smudged and made more of a nuisance for myself to get rid of as it turned the white paint surrounding it dirtier.

The unit I rented out wasn't designed to expel heat like some of the others, so I had no problems with a heater, unlike other tenants. However, one problem did remain: the leak. While it wasn't as bad as when the storm first hit, it just persisted. I spoke to the maintenance guy, hoping that bringing it up might speed up the process, but all he told me was that there were delays in repairs. Apparently, I wasn't the only one dealing with water leakage—whilst other units were reporting problems with their heating system.

Despite the issues with my apartment not functioning properly, I found myself brushing off those minor inconveniences. Something else had been bothering me entirely. Over the past few days, I've felt increasingly unsettled in my own space, for the past few days I began to experience the same day to day occurrences I used to get, when I lived with my own family—extra dishes to clean that I don't recall using, dirt and smudges on the floor I'm certain I didn't cause, missing food items from the fridge that I was sure I had just bought.

These little signs that made me feel as if somebody else lived with me was subtle at first, I even began to think I was just starting to forget easily, early dementia, maybe? No that would've been easier to deal with.

What unnerved me the most in the days since the storm were the footsteps I started hearing at night outside my bedroom door. Normally, it was quiet, and I'd curl up with a book in the dim, cozy light of my room, or maybe scroll through messages from friends and family. But now, I found myself huddled under the covers, eyes fixed on the thin strip of light beneath the door, where a quick shadow occasionally passed, accompanied by the wet tap of bare feet on the cold floor, resembling water droplets hastily falling onto a half-full bucket.

Growing up, I wasn't one to easily believe in ghost stories, but I wasn't a full-blown skeptic either. When faced with something I can't explain, I'm not so dense as to just ignore it and brush it off as unscientific. That part of me is what made it so hard to leave my room at night. It felt ridiculous—here I was, a grown man who'd been living alone for almost two years, struggling to muster the courage to go to the bathroom because I believed there was a ghosts in my apartment, how pathetic.

The prospect of moving out was bleak, so whether I was being haunted or not, I couldn't let whatever this was deter me from living normally. Thus, I found my hand gripping on the handle as I unlocked the door, letting the light from the hallway slowly fill up my darkened room; of course I saw nothing, I simply let out sigh of relief and made my way towards the bathroom near my living room. What did I expect upon opening that door? did I expect a dead ghost from a past century to jump me before I could take a leak?

Walking down the hallway, my gaze was mainly fixed on to the floor, while the warm glow from the lights above washed over the space; it being the only source of light in the entire apartment. Just as my hand hovered over the bathroom light switch, my fingertips grazing the cold plastic, I had paused right then and there.

My gaze shifted beyond the kitchen, and towards the window. A light—no, not from inside my apartment, but outside the kitchen window, directly opposite from my own. It shone like a rectangular beacon in the darkness, catching my eye even from where I stood in the hallway, far removed from its source.

Taken aback, I shook myself from the brief trance as I had stepped into the bathroom. Even when I tried to rationalize what had occurred, my mind kept circling back to that light. What could it have been? As far as I knew, no one lived in the apartment next to mine. It wasn't even possible someone had moved in recently without me noticing, as I would've heard the commotion, so the only option left could be, maybe Mr. Grant was fixing the place up?... at two in the morning. Still, whatever it was, it didn't seem to matter anymore.

Exiting the bathroom, I realized that the light was gone. My kitchen was once again cloaked in darkness, illuminated only by the faint glow from the only light source from the hall. However, just as I walked back to my room, I could've sworn I saw something—a movement in my periphery, the shifts in the shadows, darting behind one furniture to another.

For the past few days, I'd felt increasingly unnerved. Coming home from classes, I would sometimes overhear my neighbors talking about their issues with the building. I wasn't particularly fond of taking the elevator with others—it always felt awkward—but it was one of those unavoidable aspects of apartment living.

One afternoon, I found myself sharing the elevator with Mrs. Callahan and a friend she'd brought over, and they were chatting about work. I wasn't one to eavesdrop, but when people are only three or four feet away enclosed in a metallic box with you, it's hard not to catch bits of their conversation.

With my phone out, pretending to be disinterested, I couldn't help but overhear Mrs. Callahan discussing the issues she'd been having with her apartment. She mentioned a gas leak she experienced last week—luckily, it was fixed, but the thought alone was unsettling. I'd heard of a fire in this very building years ago, also caused by a gas leak. It had been ruled an accident, but still, tragedy can linger in people's minds, longer than they hope it would.

I never learned many of the details, not even where in the building it had happened, but I reassured myself that maintenance now was different from before—hoping, for the better.

As I stepped out of the elevator and made my way to my apartment, I noticed Mr. Jobert down the hall, on the opposite side from where I lived. He was a retired veteran from the military, a Coast Guard, as I recall. He was older, with salt-and-pepper hair and a gruff exterior that spoke of age, yet his solid build hinted at strength that could still take on someone younger. Despite the years , he looked like he could outmatch a high school football player if it came to it. Mr. Jobert was the only neighbor I regularly spoke with on this floor.

On my first day, he'd helped me move furniture into my apartment, most likely out of pity when he saw me struggling to get a couch through the doorway. Occasionally, I'd catch a glimpse of his daughter, Cindy. She looked about my age, though I was pretty sure she didn't attend the same university as me—given that I've yet to seen her around campus.

I greeted Mr. Jobert with a quick nod, and he responded with a curt smile as I headed toward my apartment door. My gaze drifted to my unit, and suddenly the door beside mine came into view, triggering memories of last night. The light from the kitchen window flashed back in my mind. As far as I knew, no one lived in the apartment next to mine, that thought replayed in my head like a broken record since last night. With my key poised to turn in the lock, I hesitated, then turned away, striding down the hallway to the other end.

*""Hey, Mr. Jobert, sorry to bother. Are you busy?""* I asked, my keys finding its way back to my pocket.

*""Hey, Josh. No, not at all, just waiting on a delivery,""* he shrugged, tapping away on his phone, one hand holding it upright while the other did heavily tapped on the screen. Something I noticed older people did more often than those younger.

*""I was wondering if I could ask you something.""*

He hummed in acknowledgment, still focused on his device.

*""Do you happen to know if anyone's living in the apartment next to mine?""*

*""506?""* He finally glanced up from his phone, his brow furrowed in a perplexed expression as I nodded.

*""No, son, no one's lived there in years. But, you should know that, right?""*

I scratched my brow, unsure how to explain last night's strange occurrence without sounding like I'd lost it, the thought of talking about these occurrences going on in my apartment to anyone was silly, thinking of me rambling about footsteps, random blotches of dirt and murmured whispers sounded stupid to me, it just made me sound as if I was crazy.

*""Well... last night, when I got up, I saw light coming from my kitchen window. It looked like it was coming from the window in front of mine... from Apartment 506.""*

He stopped tapping on his phone, furrowing his brow further. His expression shifted from confusion to deep thought. As I looked up at him from a shorter angle, I catching a glimpse of the scar on his neck, standing out under the hallway light.

. . .

I remembered the time I'd asked him about that scar, he had me babysit his dog 'Lady' while he was from home for a few days, when he came to pick her up I invited him for coffee, and we had small talk while his white fluff ball of a dog ran around. He wore the same thoughtful expression when I asked, clearly weighing what to say, likely recalling the events that led to him getting the scar. After a moment, once he had gathered his thoughts, he shared a story from his time at sea in the late eighties when he served as a Coast Guard officer.

He talked about his duties back then, the long nights on watch, the unpredictable nature of life at sea, what lurked within the unknown, the unexplored, where nature had made the decision that no man was destined to see. With a slight pause, he finally spoke the day he got his scar. A commercial fishing boat had radioed in for help to the Coast Guard ship he was stationed it at the time.

He and his crew, along with his partner Murphy—who he always referred to by last name—were dispatched to check it out. When their ship neared the boat in distress, he and Murphy deployed into the water to investigate. But something was off. Despite being within close proximity to the boat, they heard no response from the crew, the moment they arrived for help.

Murphy hopped on the boat first, calling out for the fishermen to show themselves. When they got on the vessel was eerily silent, no signs of life anywhere, not even a single sound, say for the haunting winds accompanied by the rain, with the sway of the sea, just no short of distance below them.

With all the lights extinguished, the ship had looked as if abandoned, Murphy joked that maybe a ghost had radioed in, Mr. Jobert didn't really find that funny as he smacked his partner at the back of the head, before the pair proceeded, solely relying on their tactical flashlights. While Murphy entered the wheelhouse, Mr. Jobert stayed by the deck, sweeping his light over the area as they both covered ground.

A full minute hadn't even gone by before a curdling scream pierced through the raining ambience. The scream came from inside the wheelhouse, muffled as the scream was barely contained inside the small shed. Mr. Jobert's heart raced as he rushed to check on his partner. He needed not to check inside the wheel house as the door opened on its own, with Murphy's body had collapsed against it, causing it to come wide open. Mr. Jobert's flashlight beam fell on his partner's form, and what he saw made his stomach drop.

Murphy's chest was filleted open, the bones from his chest ripped out as flesh and blood protruding from deep, claw-like gashes. His face was frozen in an expression of horror, his eyes wide and unblinking as they locked onto Mr. Jobert's. With a trembling hand, Murphy clutched his bleeding throat in an effort to stop the bleeding spilling from his open throat, choking on his own blood. His eyes seemed to scream a silent warning, pleading for Mr. Jobert to run, yet no words escaped his lips—only a sickening gurgle before life drained from his body.

Mr. Jobert frozen, standing in nothing but the shock of his partner's death gripping him, in his eyes at that moment, everything unfolded in a blur. The man he's spent countless of hours to years with as friends and companions was dead right in front of his eyes. Murphy promised him he'd be there for his wedding, he'd be there to see him and Lanie get married.

He was barely holding himself together, let alone fully in comprehension of his situation, when in an instant his flashlight illuminated the open door, something lunged at him with a speed void of any humanlike attributes. He barely got a good look at whoever or whatever it was, before the force had knocked him off balance, causing him to tumble backward at the railing of the ship, his flashlight slipping from his grasp and clattering uselessly as he fell over the side of the boat, plunging into the cold open sea.

Disoriented, he struggled to make sense of what had just happened. He began to realize he was under water as his lungs burned for air, while he instinctively kicked towards the surface, but then a chilling realization hit him—whatever had attacked him, had fallen into the water too.

Fighting against panic, he swam desperately to break through to the surface. The storm above raged violently, with rain and crashing waves making it near impossible to see. His only thought was to get back onto the smaller boat, to escape and reach the safety of the Coast Guard ship. But just as his fingers barely grazed the surface, a cold, scaly grip clamped onto his ankle, the hard piercing scales scratched onto his skin.

In an instant, he was yanked back down into the depths.

Mr. Jobert fought desperately, thrashing against the force pulling him deeper into the dark abyss. With his vision rendered a blur by the water and the panic rising from his chest, he twisted himself around, getting a good look at what had attacked him and his partner—the creature responsible for Murphy's death. Through the red haze of anger and rage he felt in that moment, crippling fear had latched itself onto him as he bared a sight he would never forget, its terrifying form etched itself into his mind, haunting him to this day.

It wasn't human, hell it wasn't even an animal, what Mr. Jobert saw that faithful night was an unearthly aquatic humanoid. Its body was covered in slick, glistening scales, and its limbs were webbed like a grotesque merging of man and sea. Fins protruded from its spine starting from the back of its head down to its tailbone, what locked onto Mr. Jobert was its glowing red eyes bore fully of carnal rage and hunger with an otherworldly intensity.

The creature was either completely feral, or pure evil. Its gaze cutting through the water, locking onto him. After a moment of thrashing in silence, the creature let out a deafening cry—a sound unlike anything he'd ever heard throughout what his time at sea. It started as a deep, haunting whale-like call that had morphed into a glass shattering shriek that rattled his skull, if it weren't for the fact that they were underwater, the piercing echo would've ruptured his eardrums.

Mr. Jobert seen what that thing had done to Murphy, he wasn't going to allow it to do the same thing to him next, for his survival, for his fiance, and for his partner Murphy. He was going to survive, even with nothing but the skin of his teeth, and the fire under his ass. Summoning the strength he could gather, Mr. Jobert lifted his free ankle and used his hard boot to kick the creature square in the face, feeling the satisfying crunch boot against its tough, scaled skin.

The grip on his ankle loosened as its claws started to spread apart from the tight hold, he wasted no time, kicking himself free once more. His lungs burned for air as he swam to get to the surface, until he caught sight of the dark silhouette of the small boat nearby—the small rescue boat he and Murphy used to reach the ill-fated fishing vessel.

Driven by pure survival instinct, he surged upwards, the muffled rain louder as he approached the surface closer. With his heart pounding in his chest and his lungs feeling as if it was going to burst inside his chest, Mr. Jobert aimed for the surface, kicking with all his might.

With the sliver of hope wrapped around him, he felt a sharp grip coil around his shoulders—rough, scaly arms digging into his skin as the creature latched onto him to pull him back down deeper into the depths of the sea. Its cold body pressing against his back, dragging him down like a relentless predator. Panic surged through him, and his muffled scream was lost in the bubbles of water as he nudged and elbowed, struggling to unlatch the thing attaching itself onto him.

In abject fury, Mr. Jobert felt as if he was close to his wits end, feeling his resolve slowly deplete, his fists pounding against the creature's grasp as it clung to him like a drowning parasite, desperate for its host. Its claws latched onto his neck, drawing minimal blood from the piercing grip. This thing was relentless, but Mr. Jobert wasn't going down, not without a fight.

Desperate, from his thrashing and wiggling free from its grasp, he had managed to have enough space to turn his body around, the moment they faced each other, he plunged his thumbs into the creature's eye sockets. His fingers pierced into the creature's presumed weak spot, feeling the cold wet tissues wrapping around his harsh thumbs, whilst deep in its sockets, with his nails pressed against the corneas.

The monster let out a blood-curdling shriek, so piercing it reverberated through the water. Dark blood clouded the surrounding waters around them, turning the sea into a murky red haze. In its pain, the creature retaliated, despite it's blocked vision, it was still able to do some damage, slashing at the side of Mr. Jobert's neck with its claws, ripping the tender flesh, luckily not enough to sever an artery. The attack sent a sharp sting of pain through him. He let out a pained cry, out of agony but didn't stop—he couldn't afford to.

Pulling back his thumbs free, he gave one last kick, channeling all his strength to condemning the creature back to the hell it crawled out of, he used to momentum of the kick to propel himself further up the surface. The cut on his neck throbbing and leaking blood but, still he managed to power through with pure adrenaline. The surface was near, but he dared not look back, focusing on every stroke and kick, driven by sheer power and the will to live.

Mr. Jobert safely returned to the coast guard ship, though he was bloodied and shaken, the slash on his neck was a glaring reminder of the near death experience he'd just survived. His fellow officers swarmed him with questions, what happened to the boat? where was Murphy? Hesitant he'd sound absolutely nuts, he still told his truth. As unbelievable as it sounded, he detailed everything, down to the gash on his neck. He was sure they'd think he was crazy, and that no one would buy the story of an aquatic creature attacking them in the dead of night. But that didn't matter—he knew what he saw, what he encountered, and even if hell decided to open up underneath, he will continue to stand by his account.

A team of coast guard officers later went back to the fishing vessel to investigate, only to find the obvious, nothing. No Murphy. No traces of the creature or its existence, and certainly not a single fisherman that supposedly radioed them in. The only blaring evidence of something gone horribly wrong in the boat was the trail of blood that led from the wheelhouse and vanished into the dark water. Of course, when they returned to shore, an official investigation with law enforcement involved was launched. But it led nowhere, as there were no solid leads, no body to recover, no witnesses beyond Mr. Jobert, who's presumed to be a nut job, though medical and psychological tests proves otherwise, they have no evidence to corroborate his terrifying account.

Murphy was officially listed as ""missing, presumed dead,"" and despite his death, no one could link it to Mr. Jobert or to anything natural. The story was filed away as an unsolved mystery. But even if the rest of the world had to move on, Mr. Jobert never did. He believed—no, *he knew*—what had happened that night. Whether anyone believed him or not didn't matter. That was his truth. And every time he glanced at the scar on his neck, he was reminded of the horror beneath the waves that had claimed his friend and nearly taken his life too.

. . .

*""That does sound strange... Look, it may be unlikely, but it could've also been Grant. Seems far-fetched he'd be doing checks or repairs at that hour, but still.""*

Mr. Jobert's voice cut through the haze in my mind, forcing me to shake off the thoughts that had been swirling around. I tried to focus on what he was telling me.

*""I thought the same,""* I admitted. *""Mr. Grant's been pretty tied up lately with all the repairs around the building. He hasn't even gotten around to fixing my A/C.""*

Mr. Jobert nodded knowingly. *""Yeah, slow repairs aren't exactly uncommon here. You've been here long enough to know. Even if they're swamped with work, they're always slow to respond.""*

I found myself agreeing, thinking over his words, but before I could form a proper response, the elevator behind us dinged. A man in a delivery uniform stepped out, briefly scanning the hallway until his eyes landed on us. He jogged over, pizza box in hand, confirming the order with Mr. Jobert, as I stepped aside letting them handle the exchange.

*""Hey, kid,""* Mr. Jobert said after paying for the pizza, *""fancy coming in for a slice? I decided to just order in for supper. Cindy said she couldn't make it today, busy with whatever school stuff she's got going on.""*

*""Sure.""* I nodded with a chuckled grin.

I wouldn't turn down free pizza, even if someone held a gun to my head. When the delivery guy left through the building elevator, I followed Mr. Jobert inside his apartment. It felt cozy, distinct and as homey as I remembered it would be since the last time I've been. I didn't feel the strange unease that had plagued over me in my own place lately. Here, I could relax and breathe easily, even if it was only for a little while.

Days had passed since my talk with Mr. Jobert, still no sign of Mr. Grant. He didn't come to my apartment to check on anything, none of the complaints I had seemed to have even reached him as I was left on delivered. I really wasn't a stickler to get these issues resolved quickly, if it wasn't for the mold on my A/C that had worsened to the point of it being unbearable to be around. It was spreading out, thick and dark clumps of mold attached itself to the ventilation grills, and the smell... It resembled something rotting, putrid enough to turn my stomach. Eating in the living room had become impossible. I spent most of my time holed up in my room just to escape the stench.

What really pushed me over the edge was when one morning I woke, I found drops of liquid leaking from the vents again, when I heard the familiar sound of liquid tapping on the floor. Only this time, it wasn't water. The blackened mold had begun seeping out between the grills in ink-like streaks, as if an octopus erupted from inside the ventilation system. Since I've been asleep when the leaking had begun, I wasn't able to catch it in time before it made an even bigger mess to clean up. This was a nightmare—scrubbing and mopping for what felt like hours as my arms started to feel restless, doing whatever it could just to get rid of the foul-smelling mess.

Frustrated, and feeling like I'd reached my limit, I finally picked up the phone and called the maintenance guy.

He didn't pick up, and with two hours left before class, I had enough time to pester him until he answered. Frustrated, I spammed his phone with missed calls, feeling like an obsessive ex, when finally, just as I was rifling through the fridge for something to pack for lunch, a crackling sound echoed from my phone's speakers. My attention snapped back to it, sitting on the counter, and I rushed over to pick it up.

*""What?""*

His voice was groggy, and I could tell he'd just woken up, which only irritated me more. The nerve—like I was the one being a bother, as if I committed a the great sin of coming to him about the repairs he should've done two weeks ago.

*""Mr. Grant, I texted you weeks ago about my A/C. It's molding at this point! I've had to clean up this disgusting mess—""*

*""Ah, shit. I'm sorry, kid,""* he interrupted, sounding more exhausted than anything. ""Yeah, I got your texts... and all the other complaints from everyone else in the building. I haven't gotten to your problem yet because it's not as urgent as some of the other crap I'm dealing with.""

His voice grew more aggravated, as if he was recalling everything at once.

*""Yesterday, that fat bitch Bertha from 304 had people raising alarms because her apartment started smelling like a goddamn corpse. I had to call 911, and we busted down her door thinking she'd dropped dead from a heart attack. Turns out she's been hoarding dead cats, and the smell was seeping through the walls. So, excuse me if I haven't gotten around to your A/C since the beginning of the month.""*

I couldn't really mutter up much of a response, he could tell I was taken aback by his ranting as he sighed, seemingly out of pity for leaving me speechless at the other line.

*""Okay... how about this,"" he offered, sounding a little less annoyed, ""I'll come check it out next week on Monday. Can you stick it out until then?""*

*""Yes, please,""* I muttered.

*""Great.""* He hung up.

Sighing, I just shrugged it off, returning to what I'd been doing at that time, before the call interrupted me. My college classes that day was as mundane as ever, with the usual routine dragging on, although it was a bit more stressful, as holidays were approaching, deadlines had to be met. With another semester being nearly over—only a more week until the sweet temporarily release from school, due to the winter break. I could practically feel the collective excitement around the campus—students, staff, and even professors were looking forward to the break for a chance to head home to their families for the holidays.

Though, it was still Thursday after all, and I had a few more classes to power through before the Monday break finally arrived, so I couldn't feel too comfortable just yet.

I was burning the midnight oil, working on papers that were due the next day, when the familiar pang of hunger hit. Leaning back in my chair, I let out a sigh and glanced at the monitor. My eyes skimmed the pages of the essay I'd been hammering out for hours. The bulk of it was done, thankfully, but it still needed a final round of revisions and a few touch-ups before I could submit it to my professor.

My eyes drifted to the bottom right corner of the screen: 11:44. Sixteen minutes before the deadline. I quickly double-checked for any glaring errors—grammar, spelling, all the usual pitfalls that professors would chew you on for, if overseen. Satisfied that it was as polished as it was going to get, I let out a deep sigh. It was time. I drafted an email, attached the file, and hit ""Send."" The weight of that assignment was finally lifted off my shoulders, as I felt a sigh of relief come out of me.

The calming pitter-patter of rain against my bedroom window had lulled me into a rare state of peace. With my essay finally behind me, I leaned back into my chair, letting the white noise wash over me. For the first time in a while, my mind felt clear—until a sudden, muffled crash jolted me alert. The distinct clatter of ceramic hitting the floor sent a jolt of unease through me. My eyes shot to the bedroom door, dimly lit by the glow of my desk lamp.

Slowly, I stood, my heart picking up speed as I moved toward the noise.

The creak of my door echoed softly as I stepped out into the hallway, the warm light barely guiding my steps. I made my way to the kitchen, each footfall muted by the quiet of the apartment. My fingertips brushed against the cold plastic of the switch before I flicked it on, and the harsh kitchen light buzzed to life, casting long shadows across the floor.

There I found before me pieces of a plate I had used previously earlier in the day, what was once a formed ceramic piece was now reduced to jagged pieces of shattered glass onto the floor. With my brows furrowed I began to clean, I assumed it had slipped somehow from the counter. I had just washed these letting them out to dry on the drain board before I could put it back on the cabinet above the counter, where I stored my other plates.

Sweeping the shards into a neat pile, my eyes drifted to the counter where the plate would have been. Something about it felt off. The surface was smeared with grime—dust and debris mingled with smudges of what looked to be mud. But what stopped me cold was a medium-sized mark, unmistakably resembling a footprint. I froze, staring at it for a moment longer than necessary. After discarding the broken pieces, I turned my attention to scrubbing the dirt from the counter, the unsettling image of that footprint lingering at the back of my mind.

Quite frankly, I would've been more freaked out, if this wasn't the first time I'd come across something like this. Just the week before, after coming home late from a dinner with some groupmates after class, I'd noticed dirt trailing from the front door to the living room. At the time, I shrugged it off, assuming it was my own doing, maybe from rushing in and out? But now, with the footprint shaped mark on a counter, I was sure I hadn't caused, it boggled my mind.

I knew for certain that this time it wasn't me. And I had no idea what to make of it.

On my way back to my room, no longer feeling the need to eat, that eerie sensation returned—the same one I had felt the night I hesitantly stepped out of my bedroom, the same night the kitchen window had glared with the unnatural light from the mirroring window next door. Only this time, there was nothing. No light, no unexplained footsteps that I tried to pass off as dripping water. Just silence.

I stood frozen for what felt like five long minutes, staring into the dim, hollow space of my living room. The shadows twisted unnervingly, and the outlines of my furniture felt uncanny, as if the empty leather seats were watching me, accusing me of being an intruder in my own home. A chill gripped me, creeping up my spine, as I saw it, a dark hand emerging from behind the couch, gripping the seat to help itself up further, slowly rising as the smell of rotting emitted from the ventilation above became more prominent.

My chest tightened, and before I knew it, my eyes stung with tears I hadn't realized were forming.

The tension snapped, and I bolted to my room, slamming the door behind me, causing the crucifix attached above the doorway to shake, as I flicked the lock with shaking hands. With my back pressed against the door, sinking myself to the floor, the gentle, warm glow from my desk lamp was my only comfort, casting a soft light in the room that barely reached the corners.

I sat with my knees pulled to my chest, hugging myself tightly like a child seeking shelter.

My forehead rested against my knees, and for a brief moment, I let my body curl in on itself, trying to find peace in that fetal position, hoping to feel safe again. With stray tears trickling slowly down the skin of my cheek, I heard the faint sound of a music box, its soft, lilting notes permeated my ears, hearing the source coming from under the slit of the door, slowly lulling me to sleep.

1h6hax5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h6hax5/what_to_do_about_my_mum/,What to do about my mum?,"Hey reddit,

 

How’s it going? I’m looking for some advice on a situation with regarding my mum. I’m a 35 male and have a 9month old daughter with my partner 36 female.

I’m not sure where to start as this needs unboxing so ill start with the most recent about 4 months ago she rang up and asked if she could take my partner and our then 4 month old to see her partners mum we both said no. I was hesitant as ive never met my mums partner family and my partner said no because he smoked weed and she didn’t want our 4month old daughter being  in an area (we have nothing against people who do that as we have both tried it). My mum and he do go upstairs to smoke when we went up to visit.

Anyways we said no, and she lost it saying things like “we never include her, we never let her do anything & accused us of saying the house was dirty & smelt of weed” and then she hung up we had said no such thing my partner tried to explain before my mum went off on one.

My partner to put it nicely was furious and wanted me to take her to see my mum. I had to pull over and get out and gave her a hug to calm her down. Only saving grace was my aunty was there to witness it and she wasn’t impressed so we had her as a witness. My mum rang back up and said she “feels what she does isn’t good enough” and said some more stuff and then hung up. She then texted me apologising and saying that she still loves me/us. I responded saying shes not welcome at the house & to stay away from us. She then replied and according to my partner she accused her of trapping me, I never responded & just left it as that and got on with my life.

My mum & partner argued when I first introduced them, my mum brought up an incident involving the two of us from over 10 years ago. I was against telling my mum about when my partner was pregnant, but she & my dad argued on my mum’s behalf to give her a chance.

Then back in September my brother 24 Male messaged me letting me know that our mum was in hospital she hadn’t been well and was shortness of breath, had abscesses & was going to be tested for heart failure. I thanked him and told him if he or our sister 30 female needed me then ill help out. Not long after that a few weeks I think she texted my asking how we’re all doing. I told my partner and I responded with a we’re doing ok and I hope shes doing well.

She asked to meet up to which I agreed to after discussing it with my partner and we said it would just be my & my mum we left our daughter with my dad while I went to the local costa coffee shop & my partner went to Mcdonalds nearby so we could meet up & go shopping afterwards.

I got there a little early got my drink & sat down, she arrived 15 minutes later and the first thing she did was apologise and doesn’t know why she said/did what she did. My partner joined us not long after at the request of my mum again she apologised and said she doesn’t know why she did what she did.

My mum is also very materialistic and she’d by something for our daughter whenever we went up and she’d hold her and treat her like a doll. My dad on the other hand would be goofy with her and when she was able to he’d sit on the floor with her and interact my mum not so much. I said this to her id rather her spend time with her than by her stuff.

I also said she needs to stop bringing the past up to which she responded I need to do the same thing. There are things I would like to say & to clear the air but I don’t feel like im able to with my mum.

She messages me every so often asking how we’re all doing but I just don’t have the motivation to reply back. My partner thinks she’s after something or has an angle to play to wanting to get back in touch. And im confused & unsure what to do or say. What if I didn’t try hard enough? What if my daughter hates me for not letting her have a relationship with my mum? What if my mum twists it into her favour sometime down the line?

My partner says our daughter is telling us she doesn’t want to be around her whenever she sees me, our partner, my dad & my brother she smiles & gets excited but on the other hand with my mum & sister she doesn’t do anything. My sister came up the other day and sat on the floor for 10 minutes with her niece before going back to her phone.

She also tells me that I clam up when im around my mum like I go into survival mode or go on auto pilot to which I respond with my mum scares the crap out of me.

It has a nice note of cinnamon and very dominant note of cardamom. The coffee in it is not that dominant. It is a bit less sweeter than the normal khamrah and honestly smell wise, I feel like I want to keep smelling it throughout the day. It is a nice sweet and not at all a feminine scent, smell wise I would give it 10/10

The projection on it is not very loud if you wear about 8 to 12 sprays, people will be able to smell you for around 1.5 hours then it creates a scent bubble around you. The lasting is almost 6 hours on skin and 8 to 10 hours on clothes because the projection is very soft and it does not project loud. In terms of projection I would give it 6/10 and in terms of long lasting it is Alright

Overall, I would give it a 8.5/10 this is a must buy scent if you are into Fragrances",8,1733322406.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,14,0.91,False
1h6h92q,https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/1h6h92q/a_cautionary_tale/,A Cautionary Tale!,"I started tretinoin last year in the fall, then this summer I began getting these huge, awful, cystic zits on my chin. Everything I read pointed me towards it being hormonal. I tried no coffee, no alcohol, no sugar, etc., nothing worked. It felt like EVERYTHING made me break out; sunscreen I used to be fine with, any makeup at all, etc. I made sure to start using tret even more to try and get rid of these awful zits.

I’ve recently started getting the taste for good coffee. I’ve been fine with filter instant so far as I didn’t really discern the difference (coffee was just coffee, if you know what I mean). 

Right now, I’ve elevated things a little bit by using coffee bags but I’m looking take the leap with a moka pot. Do you have any advice for a new user?

For some background:

- I already have electric scales 
- I have an electric hob/stove that has glass on top
- I already have an electric spice grinder (which I think also doubles as a coffee grinder)

What model of moka pot would you recommend? What’s the ideal type of coffee for a beginner? Is there anything else I need? Are there any good videos to guide me on technique? 

Many thanks ",4,1733322338.0,mokapot,5,1.0,False

BE it as it may, my robot (i6) is taking more and more time per zones now than when I bought it.  It keeps pausing to supposedly ""recalibrate""?  Rubbish.  Be it if it hits a wall that it has hit a million times and mapped, or just deciding to take a break, it will sometimes sit on a spot for up to 1 minute and ""THINK"" about what next step to do.  It's making me nuts because I have smart lights set to turn on in areas where it needs to go so that it has sufficient lighting, but now with this BS delay per room, the schedules are all off and it's gotten to the point where some lights come on and ultimately turn off before the \*&\^!@\*&#\^ ROBOT has even reached the room!  I got so upset today I shoved the robot about 6 feet across the floor because it paused at a corner to check GOD KNOWS WHAT.  I think it sensed my frustration cause it scurried off to the next room right away.  
Suffice to say, I know it's not my wifi cause I have 2 ROUTERS broadcasting the signal in my apartment, BOTH sending signals for over 100 feet distance so wifi is NOT the issue.  As I type my robot JUST paused again now for about 20 seconds before going over to the next room.  
I clean the robot EVERY WHEEK with an air gun (bin, filter and actual insides of the vacuum) so it's cleaner than your average Roomba vacuum.  I have an old Roomba 530 from maybe 20 years ago and IT BEHAVES BETTER!  What does that say about I-Robot vacuums?  The more modern it gets the lazier it gets??

This is a frustrating situation and I honestly don't know what to do about it.  There are days it performs normally and then there are days where it can take up to 20% more time than it should have.

She enjoys reading and will go to the gym occasionally but apart from that she has nothing that she enjoys doing on her own. 

She said she wanted to find things that she could do in her free time. Since then she's made no effort at all. She'll mention things she is thinking about trying but then when I suggest starting it she'll say no.

This weekend she was supposed to be seeing friends and I had a day to myself planned. I was going to go into town and just read in a coffee shop that I like, I was then going to go for a walk and go home and relax. I have been really busy and stressed for a while and haven't had a day to myself in a couple of months. 

My girlfriends friends cancelled so she asked me what I wanted to do. I explained that I already had plans. She said I could always do them another time or she could join me. I explained again that I just needed a day to myself. 

She mentioned that I should want ot make plans with her now that she's free but I told her than not every minute of our free time has to be spent together. I reminded her of the earlier conversation regarding hobbies.

 I said maybe she should use the day to try out a new hobby. She said she didn't know what to start so I mentioned the multiple things she's said look interesting. She said on and repeated that she wanted us to do something. 

I told her that she can't just use me as an accessory whenever she's free and that she needs a hobby and needs to get comfortable doing things on her own because I'm not just here for her entertainment. 

I told her to respect my plans and start looking at something she could do on her own. She said I was being harsh towards her but I just said that it's not fair to expect me to give up whatever I have planned because she's incapable of being on her own. 

She said I went too far but I just told her again to start looking for hobbies as I'm not changing my plans. 

Does anyone have any advise on how best to approach the situation or any other views on it?

Tl;dr my girlfriend mentioned wanting to find a hobby but refuses to actually try anything. She got annoyed at me for not cancelling my plans when her plans changed and said I was harsh when I told her to find a hobby.

I’m searching some specialty coffee sites but there is only one or two roasts that specially say espresso. Are there other blends or things I should look for on packaging that would signal to me that it would work well in my machine?

I’m loving the espresso drinks on my new machine. My boyfriend likes regular coffee light roast and we are still trying to find a good balance of strength / beans to get a great cup.

I already had a 1Zpresso X-Pro that I used for pourover before I got the F58. 

The X-Pro is great for pourover, especially light to med roasts, and I’ve found it to work very well for some coffees on espresso with the F58, but, with a lot of coffees, it tends to bring out the acidity too much, resulting in harshness. 

I heard about the J-Ultra going on sale for $159 (through the OEM), but was bummed to find that they were sold out by the time I went to place an order. 

However, I noticed that they were available even cheaper through AliExpress. So I ordered one. 

So my question is for those who have both the X-Pro and the J-Ultra: What is your experience? 

Some of my favorite coffees through the F58 have been Onyx Geometry, Brandywine Ethiopia Worka Anaerobic Natural, Crema Winter Sun Blend, Crema Kainmui Peaberry, etc. Mostly light to med. stuff. ",1,1733321746.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Unlike a lot of you I (41f) have always been an amazing sleeper. Love sleep, never had trouble going to sleep or staying asleep and I sleep hard and good. The problem arises when I need to wake up in the morning for work. I have always struggled waking up in the morning for work, even in my 20’s to now in my 40’s.  Waking up is always like torture for me. Currently I set 4-6 alarms on my phone 15 minutes apart just to TRY to get up on time. I often hit snooze on the first few and have no memory of it and fall back to sleep immediately.  And then continue to snooze for at least an hour + every morning. Now I know snoozing isn’t good for you but if I set my alarms later I am inevitably late for work because I do the same thing, hit snooze for an hour +.  I have tried the alarm clock across the room and I just get up and turn it off and go back to sleep. My lamp turns on automatically in my bedroom at 5AM, doesn’t help. 

I’ve done a sleep study and the results were normal. Earlier this year I even had a thyroid procedure done which completely cured my anxiety, brain fog and constant chronic fatigue which I was dealing with the last year or 2. Now my constant chronic fatigue is gone which is amazing and once I actually get up and out of bed I’m golden. The problem is actually waking and getting my *SS out of bed.  I’m lucky that my work is mad flexible and it’s cool if I’m late many mornings, maybe that’s part of the problem.  But I want to be an early bird, I would love to get up early, take the dog out, make some coffee, catch a little news and shower and get ready for work. I would love to be awake by 5AM every morning (I work at 7AM and work is 15 minutes from me so only need to leave at 6:45AM).  I fall asleep most week nights between 8-9PM.
