1gpajrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1gpajrz/keeping_their_memories/,Keeping their memories.,"The past few years have been incredibly tough. I’m proud of myself for being able to stand here today, remembering everything without breaking down.


Every ber months (any months that ends with ber ex. November) my grandparents would start decorating the house with Christmas ornaments, having Christmas music early in the morning and practicing which dishes to do in Christmas eve. As a teenager, i felt a bit sofocated, my sister's and i lost our parents early and it felt like Christmas is a reminder that i don't have a complete family. I didn't really pay attention to my grandparents efforts during that time.

In my college days, i got more closer to my grandparents, doing most errands with them, driving them to places they need to be. When covid happened, we were actually doing fine, i was working online and so our financial wasnt hit like everyone else. By the 2nd year of covid and things loosen up, we would go to to beach almost everyday. I work night shift and before i sleep, i will hang out with them, preparing breakfast or doing a quick drive to the beach to catch some vitamin d.

Im writing this to help myself remember what it was like. Having their favorite Christmas songs in the speaker, smelling the breakfast and freshly made coffee. Feeling the sun in my back. I truly cannot express how lucky I was. 

Im on a different journey of my life and theres no day where i wouldn't remember them. When i feel doubt i already know what they'll tell me. When im cooking, i hear them guiding me and telling me what NOT to do lol. I was a very forgetful person and hence why i wanna try to remember them so much.

Im scared that one day i wont remember how they sound and look like. 

Ma, Pa i miss you so much.",1,1731379072.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

For her, this day is one of the most holy days, made to honor those who put it all on the line and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. The General made arrangements to attend a service at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in Vimy, France, departing on a commercial red eye flight out of Toronto Pearson the night before. She landed early in the morning, well rested despite the constraints of her basic economy seat. Today was a solemn day, and The General was sure to respect that. She arrived at the memorial service, wearing a light blue dress adorned with a poppy. After hearing from a variety of speakers, including a local French politician, The General was invited to give brief remarks. She took to the stage, and took in the sights around her.*  
“Good morning to all of you here with me today. Remembrance Day is one of the most important days to me. For those of you who do not know, I proudly served as a Brigadier-General in the Canadian Armed Forces for over 3 decades, and dedicated my life to service, patriotism, and protecting the freedoms that make Canada great. I have lost many brothers and sisters in arms during my service, and every year on this day I like to highlight the bravery of one. Today, I’d like to share with you the story of Lieutenant Dan Haverson. Lieutenant Haverson was one of my officers during my tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2002. The two of us bonded back home in Canada during our time at Garrison Petawawa, sharing stories over morning cups of coffee and doing training sessions together. Lieutenant Haverson was a second brother to me. We quickly found out our unit would be deployed to Kandahar to help in the global fight against the islamist Taliban regime. While many of us were worried, Lieutenant Haverson remained a beacon of hope and a significant morale boost during the first few months on the ground. Lieutenant Haverson proved himself to be a true leader, commanding the respect of both his subordinates and senior officers alike. I wish I could bring Lieutenant Haverson on stage with me to talk about his love for service, but unfortunately, I cannot. Lieutenant Daniel Haverson made the ultimate sacrifice in 2003, laying down his life for the safety of his fellow soldiers. While out on patrol, his squadron was ambushed by guerilla terrorists. A grenade was thrown in the direction of his soldiers, and with little time to spare, Lieutenant Haverson did the unthinkable. In order to spare the lives and safety of his fellow brothers and sisters in arms, Lieutenant Haverson dived on top of the grenade, absorbing the shock and ending his life. Lieutenant Haverson put his love for his country and for the freedoms of Canadians above all else, and he made the ultimate sacrifice by doing so. It is this very same sacrifice that we commemorate here at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. Vimy Ridge was an important battle in World War I, turning the tide of the war by pushing back the German advances into France. Vimy Ridge was also the first battle of the war with all four Canadian divisions participating. During the battle of Vimy Ridge the Canadian army showed bravery, courage, and determination, winning in spite of all odds. Their spirit and conviction is a reflection of the Canadian spirit. My friends, while this is a solemn day, let this also be a day for us to celebrate the lives of our fallen soldiers, and give them the dues they deserve for putting the greater good above themselves. Thank you.”

1gpaihh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gpaihh/long_story_short_she_came_back_then_unfollowed/,"Long Story Short: She Came Back, Then Unfollowed – Now What?"," It all started when we met in college last year. We were working on the same project, exchanged phone numbers, got along pretty well, and started texting every so often. I didn’t ask her, but she mentioned she had a boyfriend, and I didn’t say anything about having feelings for her (which I do) and carried on with the rest of the school year.
One year later, on a random night, I hadn’t thought about this girl since college, but all of a sudden she came to mind, and I was thinking, 'I wonder what she’s up to.' The next day, she followed me on Instagram! I was like, there’s no way—I was just thinking about her, and the next day she followed me. I was so happy. I followed her back, and we started talking and getting along great.
A couple of days later, she asked me, 'Do you like me?' and I said, 'Yes, I do like you…' She mentioned she broke up with her boyfriend a month ago. When she told me that, I was thrilled; she also mentioned that the reason she was being distant with me before was because she was catching feelings for me and didn’t want to ruin her relationship, which I totally understood. Then, in almost every text she sent, she started repeating the last letter of words, like 'Awwww' or 'Totallyyyyy.'
Now we’ve started to flirt with each other, and I wanted to do random things with her, like going to a movie theater or restaurant. She even wanted me to go with her to her friend’s wedding as her plus-one, lol. I hadn’t seen her for a while, so she invited me to come by her work, where she’d give me a free coffee. Before I went, I bought her a bag of her favorite candy and decorated it with our favorite football teams. When I arrived, my heart was racing—I couldn’t believe my crush from college liked me. As soon as I walked in, she smiled and gave me a hug, and she really liked the gift I gave her. We talked when she was on her break, and I noticed some good body language—when a girl gets shy or nervous, she often plays with her hair, which she did. We talked for about twenty minutes, and when her break was almost over, she walked me to my car. We hugged twice, and they were long hugs. I thanked her for the coffee, and I was on my way home.
Before we met up, she’d told me her parents are strict and that she wanted to focus on herself before starting to date again, and I was cool with that. At this point in the story, you’re probably thinking, 'Okay, there’s no way this story can get weird, right?' But the next day, I texted her to say thanks again for last night and that I hoped she enjoyed her candy. She replied, 'You’re welcome, and thank you for the candy.' I asked about her day, and she said it went well. Then she texted me this:
'I also spoke with my parents right now and told them about you and I just you know hanging out but my parents don’t think it’s good for me right now to be talking with someone cause they ya know assume and were right I have some feelings for you but they think it’s too soon because of the break up and honestly they might be right (my name), you’re the sweetest and super caring trust me when I say that but I know my parents at the end of the day want what’s best for me, and plz don’t hate me but they’re making my brother go with me to the wedding since he’s already gonna be in town, I’m so so sorry I promise its nothing against you, I just know that they’re right maybe it’s best if I do just focus on myself right now and I would have told you this in person but they just told me right now and I wouldn’t want to wait to do that, that’s not right, if you ever want a free coffee though lol you’re more than happy to visit me or come to me with any advice I just need to figure out some things right now I’m sorry.'
I replied, 'Thank you for being honest with me, I could never hate you, I totally understand where your parents are coming from, and I respect your decision to focus on yourself right now, just know that I care about you and I’m here if you ever want to talk or hang out, even if it’s just for coffee, take your time to figure things out, and I’ll be here when you’re ready.' She responded, 'Thank you (my name), I really appreciate that.'
We haven’t texted for a month, but she posted something on Instagram of her at the wedding. When I saw it, it had been up for a few hours. I liked the post but didn’t say anything. Later that night, after work, I noticed she had unfollowed me on Instagram when I checked my profile and saw my follower count had dropped and this happened yesterday and also, she didn’t block me on Instagram.

Tried compiling it and it actually worked! I was so happy I can finally control my coffee machine using Emacs.

I sent a pull request on GitHub and someone acknowleded my contribution and that was it. I thought it will get merged and Linus Torvalds will personally say thank you.

1gpacwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gpacwq/expectation_of_ghosting_and_the_app_doom_spiral/,EXPECTATION of ghosting and the app doom spiral ,"22M here. I recently started my first venture in corporate America, in a new city (one of the #11-20 biggest in the US) and it's lonely. It's known to be hard to break into circles here, my co-workers are friendly but distant, and I have not found any sort of meet up / volunteer group with a consistent pool of people somewhat close to my age that I get along with. Perhaps that has made me too invested in the apps as a crutch which might be relevant in a bit. When I was in college - partially abroad, and I did a stint in NYC - at least I had a few close friends to fall back on.

I do think I'm attractive, or at least not bad looking. I mean, my profile usually gets multiple matches a day between the apps and I don't pay for any premium. I'm not muscular, relying on the face card right now. And I do have a more introverted personality which may be a turn-off but it's hard to figure out the ways I need to change it without compromising myself. I had far from the best childhood socially but have certainly worked on myself some and become a lot more interesting, well-traveled and well-adjusted. Like, over the years my 1:1 conversational ability has drastically improved and I never feel like I'm just interviewing people. But it feels hard to talk ""enough"" / not get talked over in group settings. I prefer to be a bit more observant, and find, say, silence in an Uber ride better than filling every second with conversation. It's not that I'm not interested in people. I can be witty, but not very energetic and excitable and I feel that's at odds with the dancing monkey persona a lot of people want.

I realized I needed to take a step back today after, in my response to yet another ""you're sweet but we don't line up"", saying ""dating is such a fucking waste of time in this city anyway"". The cold winter is approaching and I'm entering a doom spiral. I think it's partially rational. It's so frustrating to have such a low percentage of people respond > such a low percentage of people who can get to a date without flaking > such a low percentage of people who can actually communicate after, let alone be interested in a 2nd. I am witty over text but again, the dynamic is imbalanced. I don't know what I'm supposed to say to the 5th Tinder profile I've seen today with no bio or yet another girl on Hinge who loves The Office, her dog, and doesn't like cilantro or pineapple on pizza or tequila or whatever.

But yet admittedly I sometimes fumble the hardest when the conversation is very interesting over text and they actually seem to have a personality. That immediate shift to one-word responses or HR speak or radio silence gets me every time. Most of my successes with women before have been because they have been quite forward or at least made it easy. I feel like maybe the issue is that I'm not escalating or something, when I expect it to be a mutual buildup. But I have to be drunk and/or on a date with some physical activity to get that to work. I don't understand how people build anything after a lunch/dinner/coffee date because I always get the soft rejection even if the conversation flows.

So I feel like it's fueling a doom spiral here. Expect to just get ghosted anyway > be more checked out / not present in the process > even more likely to get ghosted probably. Is the obvious answer just taking a break and working on myself / feeling more established where I am?",1,1731378493.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I’m a mom of 5, my youngest is 11 month old. I weigh 117, I’ve already lost 3 pounds and that may not sound like a lot but it is for me. The doctor gave me pantoprazole, I took 3 pills so far and yesterday I felt even worse than before. I got so scared. I haven’t taken anymore. 
I’ve been having heart palpitations here and there, dizziness, foggy and fatigue. 
Also, I’m a cancer survivor. 8 years in remission. I’ve had a double mastectomy and reconstruction. 
I’ve been having severe breast pain in the breast where the cancer was. My shoulder and my neck. Now it’s under my arm. My MRI for this isn’t till the 20th. I’ve had scar tissue and that’s what I’m hoping this pain is. 

Idk if any of it is connected. I don’t want to die. I want to eat and be healthy for my kids and live a happy healthy life. My quality of life is so terrible right now it’s bringing to depression. I’ve had the best life since surviving cancer and all my beautiful babies. I can’t even enjoy them and my life! I feel like giving up. 

All my bloodwork looks good except something called lipase levels, these seemed slightly elevated and I’m waiting on my doctor to call me and talk to me about what those even mean. 
Just as a side note, I know what I wrote is all over the place, sorry about that. But please be kind, this is a lot of personal information I’m already having anxiety about sharing this with strangers but idk what else to do. I really need help.

My main goals were to experience a range of ""alternative"" processes, while also experiencing some better roasters.  I do like a sweeter cup with a little more body.  

So far it's not a disappointment.  While I'm not 100% sure the coffees I've tried are worth 2-3x my local roasters,  they do seem more ""refined"" with none of the rough edges and slight harshness or negative flavors I get in most local roasts. This is from B&W red fruits (needs more rest), Dak Coco Bongo (ditto), and 94 Celsius Fruitopop (not pictured - awesome cups every day - roasted 10/2)

 If this is a consistent finding across all 10 bags, maybe the answer is ""yes, it's worth it.""  But maybe it's the processing more than the roasting. Maybe it's a little of both.

I'll probably hit a few more local roasters as I work through these beans, but who knows?  There are just so many awesome beans to try!  I can also see working through as many of the Top 50 roasters as I can manage to develop some personal benchmarks for trying other roasters. Looks like maybe 20-25  could be accessible without breaking the bank.  That could be a fun 2025.  :)

Anaerobics and Co-Ferments have  been hard to find in Pittsburgh.  I'll make sure to leave tasting notes in the weekly threads as I dial-in each coffee.

Yeah, first thing first, I know IATA in this. I have never done this before neither, but I couldn't resist the urge to try this as it kind of give me some insight.

Long story short, I met this girl through a dating app. She was the one who texted me first, with an very energetic opening if I ever see one from a girl on dating app. After sometime talking to her, I found her very attractive, she is pretty, has the same vibe as me, we share many hobbies, and she has a good job and live very near me.

After a day or two, we moved our talk to FB messenger, and here is where the drama begin. She was much less responsive to my messages, as she only replied 2 or 3 times a day. In the first days, I only thought she was busy as it was weekend when we were texting on the dating app, and now it was weekdays. But then I saw her online a whole lot, but didn't respond, so one day, a little frustrated, I took out a clone account and texted her.

On the main account, I was myself, a quite caring and attentive guy as many people opinon. I tried to ask her how was her day, was she still hurt (she had an accident recently), or was she need any help (she often ranted about how the injuries affect her daily life). I also tried to be respectfully and kept the conversation light-hearted, but of course still flirting here and there to let her known I'm interested in a romantic relationship. All of those but all I got was some one liner and sometimes she totally ignored my messages.

But on the clone account, I was super flirty and threw a bunch of foreshadowing, sexual jokes, and be kind of an ass by my definition but guess what, she was way more reponsive.

Yesterday, she texted me on my main account that she was drunk, I immediately call her to ask if she was ok and offered her a ride home. She ignored it and said she missed my call because she was on road and arrived home safety. I was outside having coffee with my friends so we agreed we would call and talk to each other when I got home. But then she totally ignored my messages and calls afterward.

Frustrated, I used my clone account to massage her, pointing out that the frequency of her responds was match with me on my clone account, so I didn't feel reciprocated, so I thanked her for her time and said we should end it here. Then the unexpected happened, she was replying to my clone account massages instantly, almost begged me to try continue to talk with her, said she will miss our bantering very much, and she even show some caring for my clone account this morning asked if I had a good night sleep and how was my morning.

She restricted me on my main account.

I was honestly baffled. She is still texing my clone as of now and I'm not sure if I should tell her the truth. 

Tldr: used 2 accounts to text a girl. On main be myself, caring, light-hearted, on clone, flirty, bad boy vibe. She blocked the main account and try to talk with the clone.

Our boss found out about it and told us we needed to give them back. Since the son had already gone home, we were told to give the gift cards to the front desk so they could hold on to them. The son came in the next day and asked if everyone had gotten one and we told him that management told us we weren't allowed to have them. He got upset and went to the front desk saying that he had already talked to state or something and they had given him the okay to give us giftcards as long as it wasn't over $25 per person. So my boss said he would hand them back out. We still have not seen a single giftcard and my boss has been suspiciously showing up to work almost every day with a Starbucks coffee

I asked my boss today when we would get the gift cards back and he said that he would be giving them away in a ""raffle"" for our next staff meeting so that everyone would have a chance to get a gift card instead of just carestaff (so like housekeeping, management, activies, and kitchen staff) even though the resident's son specifically gave them to care staff. I don't think it's fair at all, now people who were given a gift card have a change to just not get one. And people in other departments will get a chance to get a gift card that was not meant for them.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

1gp9yrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1gp9yrp/navigating_two_different_friendships_and_want_to/,Navigating two different friendships and want to be inclusive... but have questions?,"**BACKGROUND:** I am a college junior who lives with a nice roommate I'll call Peggy. We don't have everything in common (e.g. Peggy is more introverted than me; whereas I like to go out and chat at a coffee shop, Peggy prefers watching shows on her phone). Ultimately, I do enjoy talking to Peggy and feel close around her. However, it's taken me a while to really find ""my people"" and right now, I think I've finally found them. Here's why:

**SITUATION:** I recently got involved with a student org and made a group of friends there, including someone I'll call Kara. Kara and I often will eat lunch together in the cafeteria or go for walks. One time Peggy and Kara both asked me to make plans at the same time, so I decided to ask them if they'd like to get a meal together (something low key). I always feel awkward when I know both people but they don't know each other, though I will say it went pretty well. (We actually tried a really good brunch place, so even when there were lulls in the convo, at least we could comment on the food.)

**CHALLENGE:** However, I have plans with Kara tomorrow night (she asked me to do something), and for some reason, I'm thinking about just limiting the plan to Kara, and not including Peggy. I don't think Kara would mind, but it's just hard to explain since sometimes I do want 1 on 1 time with a friend. Also, Kara and I like to talk about things related to our student org, and I wouldn't want Peggy to feel left out. Kara and I do regular walks three days a week, and usually Peggy is free then, so I feel like I should ask her (and there's always a chance Peggy asks to join me, not knowing I have plans with Kara). One time I didn't come back to our dorm and just camped out in the student lounge, because Peggy would probably ask where I was going and I didn't want to just show up to my plan with Kara with Peggy without checking with her first.

Idk why I'm struggling to navigate this situation. I don't want Peggy to think that I'm not friends with her anymore, but it feels awkward if I just start inviting her to all my hangouts with the student org. But then when I invited her to brunch with Kara, she was really eager to come along.

Does anyone get what I'm trying to get at? I want to spend time with both Peggy and Kara and my student org friends, but I'm not sure if I'm handling it right. (I'm pretty clueless with how to make friends, given I've only had a couple of close ones.)",1,1731377307.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

When I first met him, before he moved in, he seemed like an alright guy, asking how I was and such. He moved in 2 days ago though and I can't help but feel slightly disrespected. 

I made dinner the first night so he and my mom could settle in and he came out and quite rudely complained about how I seasoned it, saying it was too spicy (I used the seasoning he requested) and stating he ""needed to teach me how to cook"". I don't mind criticism, and if he would have said it in a nicer way I wouldn't have been so offended. I've been cooking since I was very young and everyone always says it's really good. My mom, who overheard what he said told him to apologize for being an a-hole and he did. I still feel like it wasn't genuine though.

As I was writing this post, he came into my bathroom, stared at me for a few seconds, closed the door and proceeded to use it. When he was done, he knocked on my door and said I needed to clean up my bathroom because he would be using it too. I was confused because I thought he would be using my mom's (like he always has) and if my bathroom was to be used I would've liked to have been informed. My bathroom isn't super messy I would also like to mention, there's perfume on the counter and some clothes on the floor as I haven't had a chance to do laundry. I, of course don't mind sharing or cleaning up but I wish someone could have told me so I could've done that.

On top of everything, he leaves the coffee pot a mess, leaves his beer cans and bottles all over the place, and complains about everything. I don't feel comfortable with him here but I also know my mom cares for him, he will contribute to rent starting with his next paycheck, and if he doesn't live here he will be homeless. My mom seems to be on my side with the whole rudeness thing, but she also says ""he's an a-hole, that's just how he is"" whenever I say something negative.

# Key points:

* Our weekly Commitment of Traders update highlights futures positions and changes made by hedge funds across forex and commodities during the week leading up to last Tuesday, 5 November—the day of the US elections.
* Speculators bought euros, sold yen and sterling, overall leaving an elevated dollar long nearly unchanged.
* Temporary buying of crude oil and emerging profit-taking in precious metals amid dollar and yield strength.
* The agriculture sector saw increased demand for grains, led by soybean oil and corn, while the livestock long hit a seven-year high.

# Forex:

Speculators spent the days leading up to the US elections cutting exposure on both long and short positions. Overall, this left the gross dollar long versus eight IMM futures down just 3% to a yet elevated USD 17.7 billion. Exceptions to the risk reduction focus were the JPY and CAD, where speculators increased existing short positions in both. As per the table below, the biggest changes were a USD 3.9 billion equivalent reduction in the EUR short, a USD 1.7 billion equivalent reduction in the GBP long, and the mentioned USD 1.6 billion equivalent increase in the JPY short.

# Commodities:

In the latest reporting week, the Bloomberg Commodity Index rose 0.7%, partly reversing losses from the previous week, with gains in energy, industrial metals, and grains more than offsetting losses in precious metals and livestock. The reporting week included all market action until a few hours before Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s resounding victory in the US elections became known.

Renewed, but as it turned out, temporary strength across the energy sector saw speculators rush back into crude oil and distillates (diesel), lifting the combined WTI and Brent positions by 54% to 220,000 contracts, while short covering reduced the gas oil short by 65%. Elsewhere, emerging profit-taking across precious metals saw the gold net long reduced to a three-month low, while a second week of selling lowered the silver net long to a two-month low. Both metals, including platinum, traded lower on profit-taking ahead of the US elections, weighed down by dollar strength and rising Treasury yields.

The grains sector short position was further reduced amid strong demand for soybean oil due to surging prices, supported by robust export demand and a rally in rival palm oil prices driven by concerns over lower-than-expected outputs. The bean oil long reached a 20-month high, while corn flipped back to a net long for the first time in 15 months. The softs sector, meanwhile, saw mixed trading, with net selling in sugar and coffee being the main feature, while livestock length continued to increase despite some emerging price weakness.

# What is the Commitments of Traders report?

The COT reports are issued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the ICE Exchange Europe for Brent crude oil and gas oil. They are released every Friday after the U.S. close with data from the week ending the previous Tuesday. They break down the open interest in futures markets into different groups of users depending on the asset class.

Commodities: Producer/Merchant/Processor/User, Swap dealers, Managed Money and other  
Financials: Dealer/Intermediary; Asset Manager/Institutional; Leveraged Funds and other  
Forex: A broad breakdown between commercial and non-commercial (speculators)

The main reasons why we focus primarily on the behavior of speculators, such as hedge funds and trend-following CTA's are:

* They are likely to have tight stops and no underlying exposure that is being hedged
* This makes them most reactive to changes in fundamental or technical price developments
* It provides views about major trends but also helps to decipher when a reversal is looming

Do note that this group tends to anticipate, accelerate, and amplify price changes that have been set in motion by fundamentals. Being followers of momentum, this strategy often sees this group of traders buy into strength and sell into weakness, meaning that they are often found holding the biggest long near the peak of a cycle or the biggest short position ahead of a through in the market.

I analyzed 200 writers’ habits to find out what actually works,"I run a growing (\~200 users) platform for writers, most of whom are also active on this subreddit. Recently, someone asked me, “I wish I could write every day. What should I do to get to that point?”

I dived into the data, and three distinct groups of writers began to emerge. Here’s what I found — along with data-driven insights on how to motivate yourself to write more consistently.

# 62% of writers are active 1-2 days per week

These writers don't show up often. But when they do, they write like their pants are on fire. There's no discernable pattern to when they write — it could be Tuesday at 3am or Sunday at noon. They log on at random times, hammer out words nonstop, then vanish.

*Typical pattern:*

* One 8-minute writing session per week, with 6 minutes of active typing.

***If this is you:***

* Don't get down on yourself for not writing enough. If you write for more than 10 minutes ***a week,*** you’re doing better than over half of all writers.
* Try scheduling a session for tomorrow during your lunch break instead of waiting until you're overcome with guilt over not writing.

# 28% of writers are active 3-5 days per week

These writers have cracked something important: consistency. On days that they write, they usually schedule two sessions: lunchtime and 6pm in their local time zones.

Of course, when I say that *most* writers prefer these times, this hardly speaks for everyone. Lunchtime might not work for you, but the lesson here is to look for transition points in your day when your brain is naturally shifting gears. Whether you’re riding the bus, waiting in line, or handling chores — these moments can be turned into productive writing sessions

These writers strongly prefer weekdays. The structure of the workweek — whether you’re in an office, working from home, or attending school — creates natural transitions throughout the day, providing pockets of time that can be leveraged for creativity.

*Typical pattern:*

* Two 23-minute sessions per day of writing, with 10 minutes of active typing in each.
* This adds up to 3 hours weekly, with about 1 hour and 20 minutes of actual writing.

***If this is you:***

* You’ve found the sweet spot — your routine is sustainable and productive.
* Look for transitions during our day when you can squeeze in a few minutes to write.
* Consider using your phone on days when you find it hard to schedule a focused writing session.

# 11% of writers are active 6-7 days per week

I was expecting the most committed group to have the longest and most focused sessions — but instead, I noticed the exact opposite. Writers in this group only spend upwards of 15 minutes engaged in their drafts, and they're 10% more likely to switch apps in the middle of a session. By far, writers in this group seem to prefer mobile devices.

This group logs the most active typing time on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Extra time over the weekend means more time for writing, and all that momentum spills over into Monday. But still, the fact that these writers are multitasking while having *shorter* focused sessions than the previous group speaks to the fact that they have real lives — families, jobs, social commitments, errands — just like everyone else. They just do a better job of squeezing writing into the mix.

*Typical pattern:*

* Four 17-minute sessions per day, with 6 minutes of active typing in each session.
* This totals about 8 hours weekly, with 3 hours of actual writing.

***If this is you:***

* Keep doing what you’re doing! Very few writers are this productive.
* Make sure to set aside time mid-week when you’re at a desktop to polish everything you had written while on your phone.

# What all this means

The most prolific writers aren’t sitting down for marathon sessions in perfect conditions — they’re grabbing moments between meetings, typing on their phones while waiting for in line, or jotting down ideas over lunch.

This challenges the romantic image of the writer who needs their special desk, favorite coffee mug, and two uninterrupted hours to create. You don’t even need to wait for the weekend — because for some writers, weekdays can be the most productive days! The best writers have learned to write anywhere, anytime, in whatever small chunks they can manage.

***Here's what works:***

* Write at transition points in your day.
* Keep your writing tool (whether it's your phone, laptop, or pen and paper) with you at all times. The best writing time is the one you actually have.
* Embrace “good enough” moments — a 10-minute session is far better than not writing at all.
* Start small. Pick one transition point in your day, and commit to opening your writing tool for just 10 minutes. Don't worry about word count or quality. Just show up.

1gp9msy,https://i.redd.it/69jgps7qmd0e1.jpeg,AITA for trashing the dinner party at the Schumanns’?,"I (36M), and my boyfriend (35M), went to Robert and Clara Schumann’s apartment a few hours late because we were getting drunk and messing around.

Before we went, my boyfriend was like, “Um, do you need any water or coffee? You’re pretty trashed, dude.”

And I was like, “Hey, look at me. You know me. I’m really good at pretending to be sober. It’s not a big deal.”

And he shrugged and was like “ok…”. But, in retrospect, he probably should have just made me stay home. But, I was really excited to go out uwu

Before I got there, I was secretly taking more chugs out of my canteen, so when I got to the apartment, they gave me a weird look because I was drunk.

Now, my memory of this is a bit fuzzy,  but I think I have the general idea of what happened.

I forgot if we ate first and then played, or played and then ate. Either way, I’m going to talk about what I remember.

Before we sat down, my boyfriend whispered to me, “Please, don’t talk too much. They already know you’re drunk.”

And I was like, “Nah fam, it’s chill. I’m gucci.”

We were talking about music in general, and I had a bit of a hard time keeping up with what they were talking about, but I do know that Mendelssohn was mentioned. And I, wanting to impress my boyfriend, chimed in with drunken confidence, “Mendelssohn sucks fucking ass.” And I felt proud of myself.

That was when Schumann came over and had some weird fit and was shaking me angrily. Like chill bruh tf?

Then we moved over to the piano, and my boyfriend and I started making fun of Robert for playing like trash. And I was like, “I’ll show you how to REALLY PLAY.”

And this is where my boyfriend should have stopped me, because I made a fool of myself and played EVEN WORSE THAN ROBERT.

What an asshole for doing that, amirite? He should have known better.

Eventually, Clara gets fed up with us, and she kicked us out, and slammed the door.

Other than that, I had a really good night. But, they say that they don’t really want to hangout with me because I’m an asshole.

IMO I think my boyfriend should have been a better babysitter, but he said that he should have been able to trust that I wouldn’t fuck up this bad. Then again, you know, he didn’t really try to take me home when I was fucking up.

I don’t think I’m an asshole.

     Flew in patched up CH46’s as HST support and as a real casualty to the ER.
    Mostly just stood my watch and tried to keep my Sailors and Marines healthy . . .

My biggest piece of advice to you is one that I took to heart from my local reptile store/breeder and followed and am so grateful that I did: BUY AN ADULT SIZED ENCLOSURE EVEN IF YOU'RE GETTING A BABY!!

So I have a stacked unit of enclosures, both are just a hair smaller than 4x2x2 and are PVC enclosures. My leopard gecko is in the bottom one and my ball python is in the upper level. The two enclosures were ~ $850 together, including tax and shipping, as well as the cost of the silicone + caulking gun to make them watertight on the bottoms. I paid about $75 for a 4x2x2 coffee table from the thrift store (including delivery and tax) for a stand. I had to buy the Reptisoil and repta-bark chips (~$180) along with the hydroballs (~$45) and the separators (~$25)  to go between the balls and the substrate, as well as the decor for each of the enclosures - some of which I had already - which I would estimate at ~ $135. I live in an older house, and we have ants. I got the enclosures just a bit smaller than 4x2x2 so I could spread FOOD GRADE ( very important!!) diatomaceous earth (~$25) all around the edges of the table around the bottom of the enclosures and haven't seen a single ant! 

Oh and plants, I have living plants but those I've collected over time.

So, I spent approximately $1,335 before I bought the animals themselves. My Ball Python was $60 + $70 for shipping, and I got my Leopard Gecko I from my local reptile store so he was just over $100 with tax. And then I had to buy supplements for the gecko's food ($18 + $23) and buy gecko food (insects, $20 for dubia roaches, $15 for 100 count crickets/superworms/mealworms), and buy snake food (frozen rats that I thaw out in warm water, ~$3.50/week) - note, food is an ongoing cost. Oh! And, they need heat sources, deep heat projector bulbs and lamps and thermostats for EVERY SINGLE heat source - so for a larger enclosure like I have for my guys, that's like three heat sources and three thermostats, and each heat set up can cost between $60 - $120. My guys' heat setups cost a total of about $360.

So about $2,255 total....but food costs and occasional vet bills (for which I have a separate savings account for each of my pets) are ongoing. 

This was a long term goal that took a long time of saving and scrimping and hoping and just getting one piece of decor or wood or whatnot for the future enclosure at a time, and then shopping sales like mad until I found a brand that was having one of those, ""Amazon Flash Sales,"" for 48 hours or whatever to get the $1,400 enclosures for $750 + shipping.  

The brand I got is Toxirium on Amazon and it's been fantastic. Just be extra sure you waterproof it with silicone and a caulking gun before you pile substrate in there. My only gripe is they have acrylic and not glass  doors, but I could probably pay to fix that, it's just not been a priority.

I would LOVE to start a discussion wherein we can all compare our experiences and costs/bargains we've come across as reptile keepers.

My next reptile I want is a Stimson's Python, or potentially an African Cape House Snake, but it'll be a while because of the costs involved and my absolute commitment to saving for vet emergencies etc for EVERY pet I have BEFORE  I get them.",3,1731375006.0,reptiles,3,1.0,False

I'll start this by saying I rarely drink coffee or caffeine (not intentionally), I don't know a whole lot about the pros/cons of drinking it other than to help people stay up and active. Today, I've learned what being caffeine sensitive is. I had a trenta cold brew today. I do take a small dose of BP meds and took it a little late today, after drinking the large drink. By 2pm I immediately began to feel like I couldn't breath while driving. I had the air on, rolled the windows down, stopped the car but the feeling was still there. I almost stopped at a fire station but for a few minutes it seemed to cease. I went home and waited about 45 min and told my spouse to take me to the ER. I felt like my throat was closing. I had to take slow deep breaths to calm myself. They did all the cardio tests, labs, urine, etc and all were good. My BP was high and while there I started to burp a lot. I've now read how this drink can aggravate acid reflux and increase your BP and heart rate. I haven't had a reflux issue in years, but this drink on somewhat of an empty stomach caused a huge scare for me. I will not drink it again, but wanted to share my story in case in helps anyone. Please pay attention and learn about things you consume to avoid any medical episodes.

I'd like to, on occasion, do each of four things:

1. Add soda bubbles to uncarbonated liquids.
2. Add cascading tiny bubbles to cocktails, à la properly poured Guinness.
3. Infuse spirits with flavors from fruits, veggies, and herbs.
4. Create whipped cream.

Chargers are available with CO2, N2O, and N2 gases ([link to iSi store here](https://isi-store.com/collections/chargers)).

There are many whippers available for use with these chargers ([link to iSi cream whippers](https://isi-store.com/collections/cream-whippers-1), [link to their Nitro whipper](https://isi-store.com/collections/soda-coffee-siphons/products/isi-nitro)).

**Questions:**

1. Which gas is used for each of the four things I want to do? I assume the first is CO2 and the second is N2.
2. Is there one whipper that can accept all the chargers and do it all, or would I need multiple?
3. What else can I do with a whipper?

I’m happy to talk to others who understand what I mean, whether they’re from similar or different backgrounds. I usually come here to take my mind off things that my hobbies can’t quite satisfy.

I’m an avid reader (a huge book nerd, to be honest) and love spending time outdoors, whether it’s hiking or simply enjoying the fresh air. I’ve recently gotten into camping, which is a lot of fun!

A year ago I got bloodwork done and my A1c was 5.9. I had a LOT of shame and guilt, as someone who’s dealt with an eating disorder for my whole life I was extremely embarrassed  see my binge/restriction cycle have these consequences.

I also felt legit fear about how I was going to go about lowering my A1c as someone who can become obsessive about food and counting calories macros etc etc.

I met with a nutritionist and laid it all out on the table to her. I told her I needed to do the best minimum in terms of number counting, and she was super helpful.

Advice she gave me:
- to aim for 20-40g of carbs per meal but if counting gets triggering STOP! the stress is just as bad for you
- increase the volume of veggies you currently have per meal by a lot, i’m talking double to triple your veggie portion 
- do not shy away from protein, make protein fun. add cheese to it, add sour cream
- focus on eating balanced meals. balance means you can also have a sweet treat, but focus on having that at the end of a well rounded meal
- it might feel scary but once your body adjusts to the new normal of what your meals look like (less carbs and more of everything else) you *will* self regulate 


And she was right! My ED specifically made me very scared of fats and protein, carbs were my comfort space. I was extremely nervous about increasing these foods, but once I got over the initial week slump of not eating as many carbs I felt FULL for the first time after my meals! I didn’t constantly have a voice in my head thinking about how hungry I was or what I would eat next. It was baffling to me how filling and satisfying eating veggies protein and fat was.

Anyway all this to say a year later my A1c is 5.5. I know this may not be much compared to how other people in this sub do, but i’m proud of myself for doing this in a way that didn’t trigger a binge cycle for me. I still eat chocolate. I still have a pump of flavour in my coffee. it was never realistic for me to say I would *never* consume those things again, it was about finding a balance of how to do it.

I’m not a professional (obviously) just someone who felt real fear through this whole thing. It will get better, you will be okay. Find a nice nutritionist. Be gentle with yourself. And get off of this sub until you’re in a better mental space! ",5,1731374850.0,prediabetes,2,1.0,False

I am not used to having to budget for drinks, as I usually do not purchase anything that is not homemade.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Rice stalks curled and billowed through the air, catching the lanternlight. The burning mustard oil illuminated two brave warriors, the brooding antihero and his sage mentor, staring each other down across the rice paddy. 

> *”Then this is your final lesson, young grasshopper. I will offer you ten more seconds of my time; after that, I will come at you with everything I have.”*

This was supposed to be a game for Din’s sake–Vasil knew that. All this time, he was just playing a part, trying to entertain the kid. He assumed that’s what Vasant was doing too, but… something about the man’s actions, his words, they felt more significant as well. His final lesson.

> *...if you wish to be strong, then what you must do… Is survive!”*

Ten seconds. He couldn’t waste a single one. Heart beating, Vasil felt his constructs rise around him, pests and predators and walls, as the trojan naga reared its head back with a mighty hiss. Finally, the clock struck zero, and Vasil commanded his army forward-

It felt like time stood still, there amidst the raining rice stalks. Then, with a roar from the battered but unbroken Silver Dollar, Vasant sped forwards. Lotuses exploded across the paddy like fireworks, shining like lanterns as they Rumbled, Struck, Heated, Reaped his constructs one by one. Undeterred, Vasant charged at him like a meteor, a smile on his face.

It felt like time stood still. For a moment, Vasil was struck with the memory of Shalin Akshaya, of that monstrous stand, dead gemstone eyes staring as it slit his neck. Instinctively, something in him tried to yell, but the sound got caught in his throat. All he could do was brace for-

-a warm basket of rice being pressed into his hands.

For a moment, Vasil stood there in shock, just staring at Midnight Rider as it offered its gift. He turned to Vasant, hoping that he would explain, or perhaps just hit him–that would make more sense, right?

Vasant just offered Vasil a smile to go along with his meal.

*“And, of course, it goes without saying, that if you wish to survive, you must remember to eat well, young grasshopper! Ho ho… This is the final lesson: if you wish to be strong, you must never forget: fill your mind with knowledge and discipline, fill your heart with laughter and love, and fill your belly with rice! Certainly, in all my years, I’ve never found a better way to live.”*

Vasil blinked once, before his grip curled around the basket’s handle, holding it tight to his chest. There was a pause, and then…

“THAT WAS TOTALLY WICKED!”

Din, watching transfixed from dry land, suddenly bursting into life. He nearly charged right into the water before Vasant stepped out to intercept, guiding Vasil alongside him.

“Yes, it was, wasn’t it?” Vasant chuckled. “My pupil has learned quite well,” he paused, before offering Din a wink. “Both of them.” 

Din giggled, running circles around them in excitement as he yelled ‘HIYAH!’ and chopped the air. Guiding them both towards the farm, Vasant glanced at Vasil as he turned back to him, looking as if he had something to say. He hesitated for a moment, and then…


“I’ll try.”

“Hm?” 

“To survive, I mean. I’ll try to…I want to survive. I just don’t want to be the only one.”

“There are a lot of ways to do right by this city, and by the people in it–including you. Sometimes you step up and defeat a great evil, and sometimes you eat some rice with the family she left behind.” He looked out to the distance, watching Muuru talking with Jyoti and Chandi, before the three noticed them and waved. “You boys have done a service to this city, but you’re both still growing. In our own ways, we all are. So take care of yourselves, alright?”

Vasil looked out at the lantern, flickering with light. From behind him, [Kaycee Sharp] placed both her hands on his shoulders, laying down her sword for just a moment, just for now.

Slowly, he dug a hand into the warm rice, and took a bite.

**Scenario: A Rooftop, Port Konwar Docks — 1:00 AM**

The smell of salt and grime wafted over Titan Patel as he looked out over the docks, idly scratching at the cone of shame around his neck. While his battle against the agents of G.A.L.L.E.R.Y. had ended in ice cream it had also dislodged the scrabble piece that was embedded in his tummy, resulting in complications. 

A trip to the vet and a few thousand rupees later, he was no longer in mortal danger. However, he had been solidly out of action for the last several weeks. His best attempts to prematurely remove his stitches with his teeth had been thwarted by the cone. Even his stand had refused to help him remove it. Titan looked over to [Pasta Masta] and sulked.

“Traitor.”

The Stand shrugged in response.

A few moments later, the sound of several pairs of pattering feet broke the relative silence as three cats jumped up on the rooftop. The first, a grungy looking black and white street cat spoke, his eyes narrowing as he viewed the tabby.
 
“Well, well, well, Titan. I would never have imagined that the day would come when you would be subjected to The Cone of Shame! I hope that it hasn’t prevented you from proceeding with paying back your debt. I would be devastated if our efforts during the riots and beyond went… unappreciated.”

Titan stood with as much dignity as he could manage before responding. 

“Don’t think that I have forgotten our deal, Ganesha, or that I have not paid much of it in full already. Do you think convincing Vikram to leave the trash cans unlocked and leave the juice in the tuna cans when he throws them out was easy?”

The second cat, a rugged but luscious orange maine coon with a bedazzled collar that read “Princess Zora” then advanced, butting in between Titan and Ganesha as she stuck her nose up at the former. 

“And what of the cats of the mountains and fields? We have been keeping our part of the deal, tracking down members of this so-called “Metropolis Suite” hiding on the outskirts of the city and keeping an eye on the cabin they keep their “Middleman” in. We have no trash cans to feed on like the cats of the city do. where is *our* just compensation?”

The third cat, a moody gray and brown tabby, sat back just out of the moonlight in the shadows staring off into the distance. While Titan thought it was a slightly absurd pose, it wasn't worth the effort to confront Samosa on it.

“Listen, we’ve done a lot for the humans of this city, but they’re not the only ones living here. The people at the cafe talk about justice, but where’s the justice for us, Titan?!”

Titan gave a moment for the other cat’s demands to hang in the air before responding.

“Stop being dramatic, Samosa, you aren’t some sort of Caped Crusader. Do you think I invited you here so that you could grill me on where your reward is for your hard work? It is right in front of you. Look over there.”

As Titan gestured down the docks, the wind caught the scent of a medley of a most delicious prize: Fresh fish, caught straight from the sea.

“I asked a lawyer friend of mine to go through a bunch of the documents from the Suite investigation and look for anything they owed that had to do with fish.” The other cats seemed a bit confused on what a “Lawyer” was, but perked up at the mention of fish again. 

“It turns out that the train lady that The Middleman killed had a controlling stake in a fishing and canning business that catches some of the best fish in the area. We are currently on the roof of a warehouse right next to the Yu Wright Cannery. In and around that cannery is all the fish that all of the cats in the city could possibly want!” An embellishment for sure, but Titan knew he had to really sell it to the others.

Titan beamed at the other cats as he paced around proudly. After a few moments, Samosa stepped out of the darkness.

“Not bad for being illiterate, Titan, but how are *we* supposed to pull this off? The four of us alone are not enough to accomplish this mission. What if the humans call for backup? How are we supposed to transport the fish? It seems that you can barely read this situation at all.”

Titan visibly deflated as he slumped down as far as the cone of shame would allow. After a moment, Zora piped up. 

“Why so sour, Samosa? Can’t you see the effort our friend has put in already? Assuming you have some humans that we can rope in, I am sure that there are enough hungry mouths in our network to rustle up enough additional paws to handle this mission.”

Ganesha walked over and pawed at Titan with friendly fervor, forcing him to get up out of his slump.

“Friend Titan, do not let the words of one sourpuss dim your spirits. I appreciate your ambition, boy. You might make something of yourself yet! Now why don’t you give the princess and our, uh, “Catman” as it were, over there rustling up some humans while I start to get the port cats organized and set?” Samosa shot Ganesha a dirty look, but seemed to let the comment slide out of mutual respect

Titan took a moment to think before perking back up excitedly at the approval of enough of the council to get things off the ground.

“Alright guys, one of the humans I live around has talked about some promising marks in passing. There is a man out on the mountain who has worked with several of my humans, and even sold one of them a powerful sword! I feel like you can track him down pretty easily, Zora. And if memory serves, that same human told me about a thief that beat them up that hangs around at the mall. Why don’t you do a little investigation and see if you can convince her to join our cause Samosa?”

Zora nodded thoughtfully at the idea of tracking down some mysterious craftsman in the mountains. A worthy mission for someone as prestigious as her. Samosa, on the other hand, sulked.

“Fine, Titan. I will track down this thief of yours. Hopefully they have more good sense than you do.”

After a raucous round of hissing and swatting between Titan and Samosa, which was promptly broken up by the other cats all of them ran off into the night. They all had work to do. The heist was on!

**Scenario: Somewhere on Mount Parapollah — 11:30 AM**

A good ways up the mountain, a blacksmith sat watching over the city he’d poured far more of himself into than he’d ever imagined. When he first came to Rakin, [he’d thought little about how his weapons might be used](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1e4abah/), he cared only for getting his sales. But things had changed, this city had changed, *he* had changed. Blake Smith knew not just the difference between a sword that cuts and a sword that kills; [he knew what it meant for a sword to *dream*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1fhr1mv/) His hands that forged weapons had now forged a brighter future, one free of the Metropolis Suite, one with room for the heroes the city had cried out for.

And so he sat, content, looking out over Rakinnagarh.

But not quite in the peace and solitude one might imagine.

“So, Blake, what’s next?” the voice of ｢Rich Girl｣ asked for the umpteenth time, once again breaking him from his thoughts. The spear, as usual, had not stopped speaking the entire walk, despite Blake’s own attempts at quiet. “You’ve still got more of us to sell, can’t let that fancy sword have all the fun! Or maybe another adventure, like the one we went on in that Nightbloom Trial?”

“The Metropolis Suite is done for,” Blake said. “Can’t I have a moment to breathe before we jump back into everything?”

“No, no, she’s right,” ｢Guessing Games｣ rattled in discordant harmony. “We can’t shake the feeling there’s another shoe about to drop. It’s not over yet, we have to keep doing… something! Besides, Sulka could still be out there, we gotta be prepared. Sometimes we can still hear their voice…”

“See, these guys get it!” beamed the spear. “I dunno about all the paranoia, but we can’t just sit around and wait.”

“That cat’s been looking at you for a while.” [Out of Touch] chimed in suddenly, breaking the flow of the conversation.

“A cat?” the three prior members of the conversation asked, bemused.

[Guessing Games] shrieked out in addition, “I knew we were being watched! They’re over there! It’s enormous!”

Sure enough, a large orange Maine Coon strolled out of the treeline, confidently making its way right to Blake and his living armory.

“Ooh, she seems friendly,” said ｢Rich Girl｣. “Who’s a good kitty, do you want skritches? Blake, you gotta pet the cat for me, I don’t have arms!”

Personally, Blake felt like more of a dog person, but he obliged the spear’s desire to pet the cat. Honestly, he didn't take much convincing. As far as he was concerned, Maine Coons really were about as good as cats got. The bigger the better. As the cat purred at his side, Blake finally noticed a strange device on its collar. As he touched it, a recorded voice began playing back from it.

“Hello friend! My name is Titan Patel. If you are hearing this message, my associate Princess Zora has successfully tracked you down. You may not know me, but I am a friend of Jim Peckle and Angelino Caballero, and I need your help. I have an important project, and only someone as skilled as you can help. Meet me at Bonnie’s Bar tonight, and myself and my comrades will explain everything.”

Princess Zora regarded Blake expectantly. The look in her eyes was more intense than he had expected from a cat. 

“Ooh, exciting,” the spear vibrated. “We gotta go check it out! Come on, ｢Guessing Games｣, tell him!”

“This sounds like it could be important,” the knives jingled. “The whispers tell us to meet our destined fate.”

“Sure,” Blake said. If nothing else, he was curious as to what exactly he was being sought out for.

Clearly understanding Blake’s interest, Princess Zora gave a mighty rumbling purr of approval before striding away. A moment later, a stand body in the shape of a large unicorn made of a cloud-like material, presumably the cat’s own, materialized and whisked her down the mountain. 

While his weapons oohed and ahhed at the majesty of a Maine Coon gracefully floating down a mountain on a unicorn, Blake stared out with a mixture of disbelief and curiosity. What had he gotten himself into?

**Scenario: Bonnie’s Bar — 7:30 PM**

Marali slid into Bonnie’s Bar through the back, nobody noticing her entrance — just the way she liked it. She slunk through the kitchen pocketing a few utensils here or there before walking out into the main room. She thought back to the events that had led her here as she took in the space. Being away from her precious mall was… uncomfortable to say the least, but the offer she had received was too interesting to not look further into.

It was one thing to have a cat following you around in the mall. It was another to have ten of them tracking you around. Eventually a tabby had come out of the shadows with several pictures of her shoplifting and a piece of paper that read simply “U hElp Wit heIst, Go tOO BonNy Bar ToonIght”.

The blackmail effort was solid and the threatening note was the cutest she had ever read. Beyond that, such an opportunity piqued Marali’s interest, if only in the mechanics. She was personally more of a petty thief, but if she was able to score something for herself out of this, she’d be more than happy to take part. And hey, the cats must’ve seen something in her to pull out those pictures.

Focusing on the room, the first thing she noticed was a group of cats pawing at a large sheet of paper on the table, meowing at each other. They meowed in a cadence almost like speaking, and it looked like an orange cat in a harness and boots and the blackmail tabby were on the edge of a full blown fight. All the while a guy she didn’t recognize sat at the table, polishing the tip of a spear. Figuring that this was the meetup spot, and seeing the cat from earlier being part of the group, she walked over to the man and decided to take a seat.

“Hey! Name’s Marali; you’re the one taking care of these guys?” She turned to the man seated next to her to ask.

He gave a small chuckle before speaking “Nope. I’m as clueless as you. I’ve been sitting here for the better part of an hour and other than a break to chase a fly around the bar and knock over a few glasses, those four have been hard at work. Name’s Blake, by the way. I’m a blacksmith.”

Mirali tilted her head as she processed the situation “So it's the cats that are planning this whole thing?”

Blake stowed his spear and began honing a few of his throwing knives. “Seems to be the case. Titan there, the tabby, is the ringleader here, but he hasn’t been spilling the details.”

Seemingly shocked out of his focus by the sound of his own name, Titan leapt off of the bartop and ran over to the pair.

“Sorry for the wait and thank you for showing up! I suppose I owe you an explanation about what is going on. Nearby is a cannery and warehouse that used to be owned by the train lady from the Suite. It is full of fish. We are going to steal all of the fish from the cannery so the other cats can have a fish feast!”

Mirali and Blake stared blankly at the cat for a second. Blake found his words first. 

“Why is this fish feast so important that it was worth getting all of us involved? Don't you have owners that feed you?”

Titan pawed dismissively at the comment “Many of the city cats don't have formal owners, and all of them have been helping me keep an eye on things since the riots. You would be surprised what incriminating things people will say in the presence of a cat!”

While Blake processed what he had just learned, Mirali leaned back in her chair “Why bring us in specifically for this, Titan? A mall rat and a blacksmith aren’t exactly the dream team for most heisters.”

Titan paused for a moment, trying to find the right words before deflating a bit “Honestly, I just heard about you from Angelino in passing and assumed I could rope you in. Looks like I was right, though!”

The smug grin on Titan’s face at the end of his statement got a solid chuckle out of Marali as she shrugged. “I can’t argue that it worked.”

The door to Bonnie’s Bar opened, revealing a group of four people; all pretty well known in the stand-using world of Rakin at this point, although some of them had faded into the background for good reason: Vasant Verve was the one to open the door, ushering the other three in. He seemed about as on edge as the man could be. Next, was Gioia Arancini, as fabulous as ever and never caught without a to-go cup of something caffeinated in her hand. 

The pair that entered next, however, was quite the surprise.

Mirali gasped, “It can’t be!”

Blake readied his throwing knives. “I thought you were finished.”

Titan shrugged “You know, me from a few days ago wouldn't believe this, either.”

The Buppet, Windy, was being carried piggyback by Ichi Ni San Go, formerly known to the world as The Middleman.

**Scenario: Vasant Verve’s Cabin — 2:00 PM**

The cozy cabin had become a frequent visitation place to many of the Moonbeam Riders. In recent days, some had felt they had spent more time there than at Soma’s Cup. Windy pursed her lips as she considered it, kicking her legs off the edge of one of Verve’s finely carved wooden tables. Maybe it was a sign of change! Without a Suite to push against, were the Moonbeam Riders needed? Just the thought put a long sharp needle of anxiety through the cloth of her chest. She couldn’t let them just fall apart! She… She…

“Windyyyyy~!” A high-pitched voice cried out in a whining tone. “You’re spacing out again!”

The voice shocked Windy out of her stupor, bringing her back to reality. “A-Ah! Sorry, sugarcube. I’ve just… Had a lot on my mind.” For a moment, she had been so wrapped up in her nervous fantasies that she had forgotten where she even was. She was spending time with Ichi, helping her adjust the best she could to a normal life. Verve was idly reading some magazines nearby, keeping an eye on things.

“Like what?” Ichi asked innocently.

“I…” She mumbled. She didn’t want to elaborate on the actual reason, so she quickly rooted around in her mind for an alternative. “I was thinking about how Titan was gonna gather up a bunch’a his fellow kitty cats to pull some mischief. Stealin’ fish from a warehouse, I think? Prob’ly dragging a few friends along…” She didn’t have the heart to outright lie to Ichi, but she figured the anecdote would at least entertain her.

Ichi immediately shot to full attention. “So, you are telling me that there are going to be a bunch of cute kitty cats all together running around with a bunch of fishies?

For a moment Ichi sat still and processed the information. She then slowly began vibrating faster and faster before she finally exploded. “IwannahelpIwannahelpIwannahelp!” She practically shouted. “Pleeeeaaaasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease!”

“I-Ichi…” Verve’s brow furrowed as he was startled up from his magazine. “I’m not sure you’re ready to… Go out again. Especially if it’s to start trouble.”

Windy, on the other hand, beamed, quite literally waving off Verve’s worries with a wave of her felt hand. “Nawwww, it’ll be fine~! It’s good she wants to help, I think. Besides, this could be a real breakthrough, I reckon! We haven't seen Ichi this excited in.. ever!”

Verve scratched at his beard as he pondered it. It took him a solid twenty seconds, the brass gears of his mind crunching the situation down into its component parts.

“...Alright,” he said. Suddenly, his expression grew firm. “But I want Ichi with someone who we know can keep up with her. I don’t want anything going wrong if it doesn’t have to.”

Windy was almost intimidated for a moment. Verve had a soft touch, but he could occasionally give her a reminder that Rasna inherited her throne from *him.* “No worries, cap’n!” She said, giving a mock salute. “I know just the guy!”

Verve took a moment before both literally and figuratively putting his foot down. “No, if we’re going to send someone to be Ichi’s chaperone, then they have to be someone who’s proven that they’re able to handle her if things get rough.”

Verve pulled out his phone and shot out a quick message. After a few moments, the ping of a response and a soft smile from Verve all but confirmed that the chaperone had agreed. He turned to Ichi and Windy with a mixture of worry and acceptance on his face. 

“Alright, our…mutual friend said yes. How about you put me in contact with the,” he chuckled to himself in disbelief, “the cat that’s putting on this “fish heist”, so we can make this whole thing as safe as possible for everyone.”

The squeal that erupted from both Windy and Ichi was as ear piercing as it was joyful.

---

**Scenario: Yu Wright Cannery, Port Konwar — 11:45 PM**

Gioia took a brief sip of coffee from her thermos as she looked across at the group’s target: the cannery that the cats wanted to raid was right next to a dock, with security moving to and from the docks and the buildings—the graffiti on the side of the wall showed this was not the first time someone had snuck into the cannery.

The plan was to have two groups, each containing a pair of Stand Users and a small horde of cats, to go in and steal as much fish as they could. Even now she could still hear the yowls of the cats sitting along with Titan at a high vantage point, appearing to be giving commands out to the cats gathered for this heist. Elsewhere around the outskirts of this area of the docks, Vasant (Verve) and Windy were helping by convincing anyone passing by to avoid the area—Gioia had also convinced her roommates Lou and Violet to help with the same as well.

She looked back at the strike teams that were made: Blake and Marali were paired up, while she would be working with Ichi. Gioia mused on that fact: a few months ago this woman had been [trying to kill her](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1ed2z4u/), and now? Here the two of them were, trying to steal some fish, with 20 or so cats waiting in the shadows right behind them.

“...This shouldn’t be too hard,” Marali spoke first, Gioia noticing while turning back from the cats behind them. “I could easily have done this myself, but if we’re not careful the guards might spot you three.”

Gioia could only smirk at that. “Well, [I’ve snuck into places with better security than this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/djw3rp/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r4m6/?)—we’ll be fine!”

“So have I!” Ichi shot up, causing Blake to hide his face as he winced at the context.

Marali turned to the other pair, looking them up and down. “Hmm…if you’re that confident, perhaps you’d be up for a little competition?”

The blacksmith looked up. “So, something like whoever gets the most fish wins?”

The knives at his sides shook. “A challenge of destiny…this was written in the stars.”

Ichi beamed with joy. “A contest! Yes, yes, yes, yes, Yes!”

Gioia turned back to the dockyard. This sort of thing always turned into a contest when Stand Users were involved, and if it’d help with Ichi in any way it was worth a shot.

The groups heard from behind them a distinct combination of cat yells—the signal to start. Titan had said that it would be cat for a certain phrase:

**Open the Game!**

---

**Location:** Yu Wright Cannery and Docks, as depicted [here](https://imgur.com/a/rJhJzAE). Each square is 1x1 meter. The cannery contains several crates of tinned fish and several bins filled with small and medium fish, along with a massive prize fish located in the locked upper office upstairs.The warehouse is filled with several bins all filled with mixed fish, along with a few racks of larger fish. The fishing boats all have 2 bins of fish and fishing gear on them. 

**Goal:** Steal more fish than your opponents within 10 minutes! The amount of fish that you have stolen is measured in weight. There are four sizes of fish, being small, medium, large, and massive. Small fish weigh five pounds and can easily be carried by a cat. Medium fish weigh 10 pounds and can be dragged by two cats working together. Large fish weigh 20 pounds and can be best carried in two hands, and are found in pairs on the blue tables. The only massive fish on the map is the prize fish, which weighs 80 lbs and is worth 200 lbs due to its superior quality! 

Live fish can also be caught during the match using fishing rods on the boats, small nets, or by hand! Each live caught fish is 10 pounds, and worth 20 lbs due to their superior freshness! There are also large, 5 pound tin cans of fish on the map and pack 10 to a crate in the orange crates around the cannery. These can be scored for 5 pounds by opening the cans and dumping the fish into your team's bin. An unopened can or any fish left in an open can will not count for scoring. The fish must be fully free from the cans to count.

There are 200 pounds worth of tinned fish, 200 pounds of heavy fish, 200 effective pounds of huge fish, and 50 pounds of small and medium fish per bin for a grand total of 1700 pounds of fish on the map. Also there is a total of 20 fish that can be caught in the water for an effective 400 pounds of fish. This means that 2100 lbs of fish total are in play.

Fish are scored by running them to a pair of bins with doors connected to Soma’s Cup in them. A fish is only counted as scored when it enters your team’s bin and goes through the door, and can be stolen at any point during the match. Preventing your opponents from scoring by blocking their bin or obnoxiously guarding their bin will reduce the amount of fish from the heist and result in a loss for your team.

There are also 16 security guards on the map, with 2 in the office, 3 in the cannery, 2 in the warehouse, one on each boat, and 7 outside scattered around the map. They have 3/3/3 physicals, 4 security guard and 1 animal lover. They refuse to do anything to interfere with the cats, but will attempt to intercept and arrest any non-cat that they see. They are armed with a baton, a taser, and a set of handcuffs and can see stands for the purposes of the match. Harming them is not an instant retirement, but severely injuring a security guard will freak out your cats, leading to four of them running off for the remainder of the match. Killing a security guard is murder, wrong, and will result in the scathing judgment of the cats and an instant loss.

**Additional Information:** During the match both teams have a dedicated band of 25 cats. These cats have 2/2/2 physicals, a 2 in Cat and a 2 in Translator Devices. They are, for all intents and purposes, normal cats that have the ability to understand relatively simple commands. They generally can follow one sentence orders, and otherwise revert to running to the nearest small fish, grabbing it, and running it back to their team’s bin. Harming any cat is an instant loss condition, though they can be intercepted and have their fish stolen or otherwise hindered as long as it does not cause lasting injury.

Catching fresh fish is also no simple task; the darkness of the water and their natural speed makes them challenging to catch. The tools on board the fishing boats are perfect for catching them, but the fish take some time to get caught in the net or bite a hook.

Blake has access to ｢Rich Girl｣ and ｢Guessing Games｣ for this match.

She sat in the corner booth of a small coffee shop, staying away from the few customers that were there. She kept her distance, not only to avoid conversation, but to be alone with her thoughts.

Today had been a good day. She'd had enough for a coffee and a muffin, and she'd been remembered. 

She wore her old jacket, one that had been carefully mended and looked after, festooned with patches that were incomprehensible to the people around her. To those who knew how to read them, though, they told a story. A lifetime of combat, of being away from home and family, until the sand became home. Until her squad mates were family.

She finished her coffee, savoring the warmth sitting in her belly, and made sure to throw away her trash. Zipping up her jacket, she braced herself for the cold of the world outside, and stepped out.

As the door closed behind her with a merry jingle, she heard the barista call out, “Happy Veteran's Day!” She gave the man behind the counter a brief wave, and shoved her hands in her pockets, heading down the sidewalk. 

The people she passed invariably reacted to her presence the same way.  They would smile, reach out to shake her hand with a “Thank you for your service!” tumbling from their lips, then get near enough to notice.

Their faces would twist in disgust, their Jose's would wrinkle, and they would hurry away. 

She didn't blame them. After years of dealing with it, she didn't even notice anymore. The smell of an unwashed body, the scent of despair. Alcohol fumes and worse clung to her like a funerary shroud.

She needed it, though. Not much, not like some of her other friends, who had drowned their sorrows in the bottle until one day they just didn't come back up. It helped keep the shakes at bay, helped deal with the nightmares. 

Still, she knew it was only a matter of time before her luck ran out. She had tried to get help. She had gone to the doctors, and attended the meetings. Slowly, imperceptibly, things had gotten worse. She had lost her job, then her home. Her friends had succumbed to one thing or another. Disease, injury, too many drugs, not enough drugs. Through it all, she had soldiered on, a smile on her face.

She turned down an alley, pulling her collar up, as fat snowflakes began to fall, off in the distance, she could see the her home. A mess of steel and cloth surrounded it, and politicians swore that one day, it would be finished. 

They'd been saying that for a decade now.

It was a bridge. “The Bridge of Tomorrow”, they called it. They had spent so much time and money building it, that the joke of “which will be finished first? Elder Fantasy 6, or The Bridge?”, with an image of the world on fire in the background had become ingrained in the collective consciousness of pretty much everyone. 

She climbed the scaffolding, moved aside the wooden panels, clambered over forgotten caution tape, and eventually made it into the small shipping container she called home. Foam and newspaper hung from the walls, providing insulation. Old blankets were balled up in a corner, in a space she jokingly called “the bedroom”. A box sat by the lone light in the container, holding an assortment of small, oval-shaped metal disks.

Names were embossed on the metal, along with numbers and blood type. 

Mendez, Juan. Rodriguez, Miguel. Vaquerano, Jalfred. Harrison, Amy

Friends. Squad mates. Taken too soon by the Reaper.

Some had gone peacefully, too drunk or high to realize what was happening.  Others had gone fighting, screaming out in rage or fear. 

She missed them all.

She had considered following them, you know? After she had been kicked out for taking too much damage. She'd been resentful, then. Angry at a world that didn't understand her, that remembered her only when it was convenient. That forgot about her when the photo-op ended.

She'd bounced back since then, relying on the mental resilience they had drilled into her. Taken the anger, the pain, the confusion, and stuffed them into a little box labeled “deal with it later.”

She'd plastered a smile on her face and moved forward. The time to deal with it had never come, and the box sat in the corner of her mind, gathering dust and cobwebs.

One by one, her friends had moved on, some to better things, others just coasting through life, but they'd all moved on. 

And so she sat, in her little container, surrounded by ghosts and memories.

The sun had set, and winter held the city in an icy grip. She'd be undisturbed until morning, when the work crews would arrive and pretend to work for another day.

Which is why the knock at her container door surprised her.

She reached for the sharpened piece of rebar she kept at hand to dissuade visitors, and carefully peeked out of the door. 

She stared in shock at the man in the other side. She'd recognize that bald head and pasty skin anywhere.

“Brandon?!”

Brandon smiled, “Hey sis. I've spent a long time looking for you. You're not exactly an easy woman to pin down.”

She threw the door open, heedless of the cold, and threw herself into his arms. He patted her matted hair, and held her close as the box in her mind opened, and everything poured out. 

She cried. She screamed and raged. After an eternity of tears, her mind quieted enough for her to hear. 

“We're family, sis. Forged in fire and blood. And I'm sorry I wasn't here when you needed me. Come on. I've got a warm place. You look like you could use some food… and a bath.”

She laughed, but it was a fragile thing. She could feel the rage threatening to overwhelm her again.

He looked at her, and spoke quietly. “Family sticks together.”

Together, the two soldiers headed off, one wearing an old, carefully mended jacket, a pocket full of disks serving as a reminder of the real coat of freedom.

Any tips to get these colors to match? Everything is stained with minwax special walnut, I tried doing minwax coffee gel stain on the trim and it didn’t seem to do much, thinking about maybe trying provincial? The pine is just so splotchy. This was just the first coat, so the rest of the maple will still get more coats and touched up and such. Any pro tips would be greatly appreciated.

My husband's cholesterol and A1C (which had tested too high) went down just by making this super simple change.

HOWEVER, we haven't changed much apart from that, and my own health has continued to suffer. I only JUST realized that so much of what we were still eating had the seed oils in it. Heck, I was eating cool whip pretty much every day for a low carb dessert not realizing it's basically all hydrogenated seed oil. I would still drink coffee creamer when we would be out and about, and I couldn't get half-n-half. 

  
I have been in so much pain, hardly able to move, joins stiff and inflamed. I finally started to really look at the ingredients list on the food I was buying and nixed the premade stuff, nixed the cool whip, nixed the coffee creamer (only drink half-n-half or milk now or nothing at all), and stopped going out to eat. My joint pain/stiffness/inflamation has gone down NOTICEABLY, BUT I've noticed some other odd things, and I'm wondering if this could be a result of removing the seed oils from my diet:

  
\- craving fried food  
\- craving a lot of sweets  
\- craving pre-made food  
\- craving carbs (I don't normally)  
\- feeling extra tired and fatigued

Most of these are cravings, I know, and I'm wondering if they are perhaps some kind of ""withdrawl"" symptoms (for lack of a better term). Did anyone else experience these (or any) types of symptoms after getting off the seed oils? If so, at what point did they go away?",1,1731373578.0,StopEatingSeedOils,9,0.6,False

Modern / Fantasy,"Hey there 👋 I'm looking for a long-term partner for detailed, slow burn romance pairings! I write in 3rd person, past tense, and I tend to write several paragraphs! I don't have a length requirement, as long as there's effort put in and the story gets moved forward. 

OC’s only & I prefer more realistic faceclaims / descriptions, but I'm not too picky. I can happily write more than one 'main characters' even if you only want to play one! I like plotting as we go to keep the story interesting! **If you really only want to play one MC, that's not a deal breaker, as long as you're still helping to carry the story!**

I am a queer nonbinary guy myself, and I lean towards masculine/nonbinary characters & queer pairings, but I genuinely care most about the chemistry between the characters! I also love exploring polyamorus dynamics, but I do not like any characters cheating. 

I'm also 33, so I'd prefer partners be 25+, but 21+ is a requirement! 

I do like including nsfw elements in the roleplay eventually - if the characters have chemistry & we have been writing together long enough to be comfortable with that. I do not want it to be instant or the focus of the rp! 

Now, onto the fun stuff!! 

**Modern settings / plot ideas:** 

Anything centered around a horse ranch, a la Yellowstone - I could also be talked into this but with some kind of apocalypse 

Something based in a small town with the classic troupe of childhood friends / sweethearts where one moved away and one stayed. Can include the one who moved getting famous and falling from fame or moving back for PR reasons. 

Single parents / exs / coparents

Getting off on the wrong foot troupe paired with forced proximity - neighbors / co-workers / roommates who find out they are in AA together / get a new job together/ become neighbors, something like that! Enemies to friend to lovers vibes! 

Something centered around a coffee shop - could be paired with a local or new to town musician who starts performing there or just a new hire or regular. 

**Medieval fantasy ideas:** my go to for this is usually some kind of arranged marriage - it's an overused troupe, but it's a good excuse to get the characters together and there's always tons of drama built in! My default fantasy system is d&d as a base, but we can collaborate on lore! 

I currently have a specific idea for an age gap between an older knight & a princess engaged to someone else. It's a classic rescue story at the beginning, and we can discuss plot points moving forward!

I also write over Discord - I'll send that out after we chat a little! Feel free to send me a message or chat request if you're interested! Let me know what plots / ideas you liked, and please add your own!! Collaborating and plotting together are really important to keeping the story going! ",0,1731373037.0,roleplaying,0,0.5,False

When I went back after covid had calmed down I had a whole bunch of cavities, I'd say around 7. Was an absolute sensory nightmare getting them filled and I apparently have a pretty strong resistance to the numbing shots. Now they found more cavities and I simply can't do it without getting sedation, which is pretty much $1,000 dollars out of pocket for me. Basically cavities are a nightmare physically, emotionally, and financially. I want to prevent the damn things, but the dentists said I have extremely stubborn cavity bacteria in my mouth from genetics. So I really want to get my oral care in order, and I have a lot of questions.

1. I can't STAND adult mint/cinnamon toothpaste. Right now I use kid's crest bubblegum flavor, but I'm afraid that's not doing enough for my teeth. I do have a prescription floridated toothpaste I was told to apply to my teeth after I brushed my teeth with regular toothpaste.

2. I use floss pics because I can't seem to finesse regular floss, but I can't get them between some of my back teeth so I end up basically only flossing my front teeth. How do I get between the back teeth without pain, and how do I use proper flossing technique with pics?

3. Should I floss before or after brushing?

4. Should I be cleaning my toothbrush beyond just rinsing it under water after a brush? If so, how? How often should I replace it? Should I use an electric toothbrush?

5. Should I be paying attention to each individual tooth when I brush?

6. Should I brush before or after breakfast? Is it advisable to brush after meals, or better to just brush once in the morning and once at night?

7. I've been cutting down on sugar and soda and going for zero sugar options but I'm obsessed with sugary coffee drinks. Is it okay to have one maybe once a week or every two as a treat? If so, should I brush my teeth after?

8. Should I be using mouthwash?

9. Should I wet my toothbrush before applying toothpaste, after, or not at all?
