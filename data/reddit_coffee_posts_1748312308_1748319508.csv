# 🌟 Top Overall Favorite:

**🇻🇳 Vietn**am – No contest! 1000/100.  
The people, the food, the culture—it’s my kind of place. Even when we got scammed on a boat ride in Ho Nai, it turned into a funny moment. They asked for a $100 tip after we already paid at the agency. I gave 1,000 VND to my friend and she laughed so hard saying, *“Baka masapak ka bi!”* 😂 (I didn’t know that was like… 2 pesos lol.)

# 😬 Least Enjoyable (but worth it):

# 🇸🇬 Singapore

Culture shock hit HARD. First time in the country and my Grab driver at the airport was yelling at me on the phone because I couldn’t find him. I pinned exactly where I was, but I still had to run to the pickup point so I wouldn’t get charged for being late. He kept shouting and I was on the verge of tears 😢 but in the end, he apologized and said, *“Take care, good luck.*” Still one of my most memorable experiences—taught me a lot about staying calm under pressure.

# 🇲🇾 Malaysia

I had a weird and uncomfortable encounter with a stranger at the terminal. He kept asking to borrow my power bank, hotspot my WiFi, and even asked where I was staying. I said I couldn’t help and tried to get away. I asked to be dropped at **Bukit Bintang**, and even though I heard he wasn’t supposed to get off there, he did 😰 I quickly booked a Grab and ran into Starbucks to feel safer. Trust your gut—always.

# 🇭🇰 Hong Kong

The people were... aggressively efficient 😂 If you’re in their way, be prepared to get *poke*d with an umbrella or bumped without apology. Rude, but honestly, kind of iconic once you get used to it.

# 💬 Final Thoughts:

Traveling solo as a Southeast Asian woman has been a *wild* ride—scary, beautiful, hilarious, exhausting, and empowering all at once.  
I wouldn't change a thing. Even the tough moments helped me grow, and I’ve built up so much confidence navigating the world on my own. 🌏

**4 more trips are coming up**, and I can’t wait to see what stories those bring.  
Not every day is magical—and that’s okay. The real magic is learning more about yourself in every new city.

1kwe7yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1kwe7yj/mardi_gras_review_51825/,Mardi Gras Review (5/18/25),"Sailed Mardi Gras this past week (5/18/25) and while it has its highlights, there's definitely room for improvement on this ship. This was my 4th cruise and second with Carnival (previous was on Carnival Breeze). That being said, let's start with the good.

For a ship with 6,500 passengers...I'm shocked at how it never felt packed. Lines never seemed any worse than the smaller ships I've sailed. Guys Burger 10 of our 10 as usual. Pizza, good as expected. Big Chicken was delicious when fresh. Chi-Bang is also another highlight. Sea Day Brunch had *some* hits as well. Cruise director (Jacky Tang) was great. I love how the stateroom halls are intentionally partitioned off from the elevator space. Shows and party's were lots of fun.

The bad / needs improvement (no specific order). The Mardi Gras Theater is cramped. The larger Ovation Theater (in Breeze) is better in every way --- especially the fact that it has a bar inside. The center stage / grand central is kind of a down grade from the 360-degree attrium (in Breeze). The concept is amazing, but the ship is too narrow to make it the best experience functionally. There's very limited ""good seats"" or ""good standing"" areas. Kind of nit-picking here, but the serenity deck is a bit bland/lifeless. It just feels incomplete considering the amount of space dedicated to it. On to the issue of climate control throughout the public spaces --- the elevators are generally warm inside. Then there's random areas of the ship that are just warmer for unknown reasons. Then there's that back corner of the Guys Burger line that feels like a sauna. They seriously should ditch the indoor-outdoor concept for Guys Burgers. The fitness center feels comfortable until you're working out and you realize the no cool or circulated air.

I like the general design of the Excel class ships, but I really think Carnival needs to go wider to make it work best. Even the open space bars would benefit from it.

More bad....the buffet is the WORST and most limited buffet I've experienced --- it seems designed at getting you to the other free options and not so free options. Pig & Anchor was a let down (only tried it on embarkation day. Tip for Java Blue, ask for half sweet if you don't want overly sweetened flavored coffee (if you're adding syrups).

1kwe1wn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwe1wn,Quite a unique machine ended up being my first one. The Heuman Brand Coffee Machine.,"Last year my wife and I got this from my mother-in-law, she got it for herself but never really intended to learn to use it; so it ended up coming home with us. 

The owner's manual provides more information about this product than what I could find on the web when looking for the exact model number (FFL-220627). I am fairly certain that this is a machine that OEM manufacturers only aestetically modify to comply with retailers' requests for a cheap product that they can sell in their countries. It arrived through Liverpool store to Mexico at around 78$ USD under the Heuman Brand name.   

It has a couple of pressurized baskets in which the biggest one can hold up to 18gr comfortably. You can squeeze in 19 if you tamper hard enough, something which I actually found to be positive in this machine. The small one can hold exactly half. 

The tamper, well, it comes in the box so you can try to achieve the best uneven puck in the world of coffee and dial it to perfection. I got a 3d printed one while I can save for a real tamper.

The portafilter looks as expected for the price but I noticed that in a review from mr Hoffmann there was a similar machine with another type of portafilter. Which one mixed with which? I don't really know and I don't believe it would make a difference. 

Now, operating the machine.

Very little information is available as to how it actually works in terms of pressure or type of head, but in the end it is able to extract coffee that somehow resemble what we know as espresso. 

I'm loving the experience of discovering what this bad boy can really do if I push my non-existent coffee making skills to the max. 

The best recipe as of know is based on the one of the test mr Hoffmann did in his review of the best under 100£ machines. 14gr of freshly ground coffee, some clicks coarser than what you usually use for espresso, which in my case would be around 32 clicks on the KinGrinder P1  (I'm aware that this model is not aimed at espresso but for this setup might be the sweet spot) and then the magic happens at around 21gr yield usig some Pacarama beans that are a little stale now. I was able to get an enjoyable drink with enough acidity and body, but avoiding the muddiness of overextraction.
 
An americano with this extraction is achieved at a 1:3 ratio of hot water. We almost always add some milk and the end product is also pretty enjoyable. Low acidity because of the darker nature of the beans but the desired sour notes that it can provide backed up by the firmness of its bitterness. 

Temperatures vary with this machine a lot, it doesn't really have any control on it. Cooling it between shots is mandatory, I learned it the hard way after I wasted a couple of pucks and ended up with channeling and overextracted areas.

All in all, the journey of mastering what this machine can really do keeps me excited for a new sunrise so I can try another shot from it. I dialed my shots for a week now and I think I know what I need to do to keep improving, I expect to find the technical limit and only then think about a new machine. I have a passion for photography and I know that creativity is expressed through an instrument which has limitations, finding your way to reach the image/shot you want, requires a sensibility that equipment doesn't really possess. It is through the knowledge of your readily available tools that one can express freely or in this case, get a nice shot.

1kwe1v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kwe1v5/i_ghosted_and_then_lied_my_way_into_a_first_date/,I ghosted and then lied my way into a first date... and it still haunts me,"Almost 6 years ago I started talking to a girl over Tinder and we hit it off fairly quickly. I remember feeling very excited about meeting her so we made plans almost immediately to meet up at the local music festival where 2 of our favorite bands were playing, on the same night. She was already going with a few of her friends, and I would go with a friend and we could enjoy the night of music but part ways early if the vibe was off.

So the first lie was that I had no actual plan to go with my friend, I was actually a little bit down with depression during that time but I do remember telling myself I was gonna go no matter what. Until the day of that is. 

I get kind of in my own head about going there alone so instead of ditching her softly, I just stop responding an hour or 2 before the start of the show. I tell myself she is fine, she will have fun either way because she's with her friends, but as I ignore her messages and as the night progresses I think back to our discussions and how much I want to meet her. I feel bad and think of a way to repair what I've done.

I honestly did not think it would work but I shoot her a message through Facebook, pretending I logged into my friend's phone and found her profile. We only had each other on Tinder and Snapchat, and I did not have her phone number so it was the only way to contact her, it kind of played in my favor I thought. I basically tell her my phone died and I tried to look around but couldn't find her, so I hope she has a good show. Of course she never sees my message because we had never talked or added each other on FB yet, so it ends up in her ""Requests"", and she's already at the show hours after our meet-up time so in her mind, I ghosted (and she was right).

So that whole night I'm kind of bashing myself for being such a coward and sulk in the retroactive FOMO of my own doing... when I finally get a ding on my phone. She saw my message through FB and actually found it so cute how I did everything I could to try to reach her.

We set up a date for the next night, just a casual Starbucks date. We sit down for coffee, walk around the block and 4 hours go by in a flash. While I did have to lie again some more about my night at the show, it is quickly put aside as we found more and more things to talk about, so the whole ghosting and lying is not even remotely something she suspects me of doing.

As I walk her back to her car, we make plans to see each other again in a few days, both happily surprised of the connection we made.

It has now been almost 6 years and we have a 4 month old daughter together. I guess I'm writing this because while it could've been pretty innocent and forgettable in retrospect, it has now shaped a part of our life and that story is something she has repeated a few times to some of our friends and family. To her it's a genuinely funny and cute ""missed"" first date at our favorite bands' shows, to me it's a reminder that I ghosted and lied.

I am thinking about coming clean but I am not sure how she will react. I think she holds this moment dear and it might sting. 

One thing is for certain, one day my daughter will ask about how I met her mother and I know I will not want to lie to her, so I better get the truth out there before that moment comes... right?",3,1748318644.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I had worked as a barista at a local coffee shop for 6 months starting last April. I left on good terms after accepting a more flexible role with less hours. 
Recently, I was looking for work, and finding no success decided to reach back out to the coffee shop owners. I messaged both individually and haven’t heard anything back, but I got a read receipt from one of them. I confirmed with an old coworker who said that they were pretty sure it was the correct number. The only reason I can think of that may be why they don’t want me back is that I talked a bit of shit to some of my friends who used to work there, only because I was upset with how certain coworkers were treating me.

Someone once told me that this song reminded him of me. He played it during one of our calls and even sang a few lines. Sa gitna ng moment na ’yon, bigla niyang sinabi na i-block ko na raw siya after ng call.

He was someone I stumbled upon while healing from a long-term relationship. He came during my “awakening,” the kind of moment when you begin to feel things you thought were long gone. He wasn’t the kindest, but he was the realest person I’ve talked to. And maybe, in a strange way, his realness was a form of kindness.

Not even a month of talking, but somehow, we both felt a rare connection neither of us expected. Magkaibang-magkaiba kami ng values, priorities, at mundo. But our conversations were never dull. We shared insights, challenged each other, debated our differences, until he’d break the tension with a “smart” joke that, according to him, only “smart” people like me could get.

Minsan habang nagsusuklay ako o tahimik lang sa kwarto, naiisip ko ’yung jokes niya. Napapangiti ako bigla.

Then reality strikes. We are different people living in different worlds. To pursue “us” would’ve meant unraveling the lives we’ve built. I never thought I’d find myself in something I used to only read about — a situationship.

Dear Stranger, whose name I’ll never know,let’s meet again in another lifetime, just as we promised. Next time, I hope we’re better people, with better timing. Even if not as lovers, maybe just as friends.

I mean the real kind. Not spilling coffee on your shirt or stepping in shit on your way to work. I mean the kind of bad luck that follows a person like their own shadow. The kind that makes you late for every bus you try to catch, but is always right on time for the worst parts of your life. The kind that clings to you, until it eats you alive.

Most people say it all evens out in the end. Little good, little bad, but somehow all balanced. That’s what they tell themselves at least. But deep down, I think everyone’s afraid to admit the truth: maybe luck is not fair. Maybe it picks people.

For some, it’s nothing but clear skies. While others seem to always get chased by rain clouds.

I’ve had my share of rough breaks—My wallet was stolen, my bathroom mirror broke, and my car broke down out of nowhere all last week. And yet I bounced back. Most people do.

But Drew?

Drew didn’t bounce. Drew fell and he kept falling.

Everyone has a friend like Drew. One of those guys who just can’t catch a break even if you handed it to him gift-wrapped. Lost his cat, then his job, then his grandmother, all in the same month. His girlfriend left him the day before prom. His car caught fire during finals week. He missed high school orientation because his bus hit a deer, and the backup driver quit halfway there. Just... unlucky.

He's been like that as long as I can remember.

He lost his Game Boy on a camping trip when we were nine. I remember that after we couldn’t find it, his mother grounded him for being careless. Thing is, he wasn’t careless. He was the most careful kid I knew. That Game Boy just vanished.

Then his bike got stolen outside our middle school. Chain cut clean through. No witness, no record, just a clean theft. Cops never found it. And I still remember Drew standing there, holding the lock the thief left behind. Like whoever took it wanted him to know it was personal.

The thing is… nobody else remembers any of that. Not the bike. Not the Game Boy. Not even Drew.

Just me.

And I might’ve forgotten too, if it weren’t for that damn trunk.

It was the summer we graduated high school when we passed through Marlowe County. We were halfway through a road trip when we decided to stop at a small town just a few miles off Highway 49. It had just one gas station, one diner, and two guys asleep in rocking chairs outside a hardware store. You know the kind, middle of nowhere town untouched by the advance of technology.

There were four of us: me, Drew, and two others—Brandon and Lex. Both friends we’d made in high school. Brandon had the car. Lex had the playlist. And Drew… well, Drew had the worst seat and a headache by hour two. Unlucky as usual.

We weren’t trying to get into mischief. We were just tired, hungry, and maybe a little overconfident after six energy drinks and a gas station burrito that probably voided the warranty on our stomachs. So, when we saw a crooked little sign that said ANTIQUE TREASURES, KNICK KNACKS & ODDITIES, curiosity got the better of us and we pulled over.

The place smelled like mildew and old air. Not in that charming, vintage way like most thrift stores. More like something in there had been rotting for far too long. It was dim, cramped, and cluttered with shelves of rusted tools and forgotten junk.

And in the very back, beneath a faded ""50% OFF"" sign, sat the trunk.

It was old. There weren’t any decorations on it and it was hardly what some would consider vintage.  It was the kind of old that made you feel like you were looking at something that shouldn’t be touched. Wood blackened around the hinges. Leather straps cracked like dried skin. And to top it all off a rusted over brass lock that was one good knock away from falling off.

Honestly it looked like something you would expect to find in a shipwreck or an attic that nobody goes into anymore.

Brandon joked about cursed treasure while Lex laughed and dared someone to open it. Drew didn’t laugh, he stood still, arms crossed, eyes locked on the thing.

Drew as he grew older seemed to get more cautious. He never expected good things to happen.  Instead, he prepared for the worst-case scenario in every situation, though it was hard to tell if it helped when the bad luck actually hit him. Usually didn’t.

""I don’t like it,"" he said. ""Feels wrong.""

Brandon rolled his eyes. ""It’s a box. It doesn’t feel anything.""

Drew didn’t say anything else.

So, naturally, we bought it.

We tossed it into the trunk of Brandon’s old red sedan and explored the rest of the town until the evening when we drove to the nearest motel to spend the night and loot our ""treasure.""

The motel did not bother with frills. It had faded bedspreads, a buzzing neon sign, and a middle-aged front desk clerk who looked like he had not cared about anything since the 1990s. We dropped our bags and set the trunk in the middle of our shared room.

""Let’s see what haunted junk we just bought,"" Lex said, popping the lock with a hammer from Brandon’s trunk. The lid slowly creaked open. Immediately a musty smell hit us—paper, dust, and something sour underneath.

Inside there was only Junk. I could see faded postcards, a broken watch, and some tattered clothes filled with holes. Not surprisingly an utter disappointment.

""Treasure,"" Brandon said sarcastically. ""Maybe we can flip this for ten bucks on eBay?""

As Brandon continued to search the trunk, I watched Drew. He was fidgeting and glancing at the door.

""Relax,"" I said. ""It’s just old stuff. Probably came from some yard sale.""

Internally though I sighed in relief. *Thank goodness it was just junk*. Nothing dangerous. I had been worried Drew’s luck would kick in and we would find something worse. Like a body…

""Wait,"" Brandon said, his eyebrows furrowing. ""Guys, the trunk has a false bottom.""

He was right. Upon a closer look, you could see that the bottom of the trunk sat higher than it should.

“Don’t just stand there, this has to be something good” Lex said, as she shoved Brandon aside and opened it.

That’s when everything changed.

Inside were layers and layers of toys, photos, and papers, covered by dust.

The first thing Lex lifted out was a battered old blue Game Boy…one that looked strikingly familiar.

Drew perked up. ""Wow, I had one just like that when I was nine.""

Panic started gnawing at the back of my spine, causing goosebumps to ripple across my skin. I looked at him. The expression on his face was a mix of nostalgia and sadness.

Next came a rusty bicycle bell.

“Drew” I said slowly, “doesn’t this look just like the bell from your stolen bike?”

Drew picked it up, turning it over in his hands, “yeah, that is… weird…”

One by one, more objects emerged.

And it stopped looking like a coincidence.

A faded collar with his cat’s name on it.

An obituary for his father. The article detailing the horrible Hit-and-run was folded and yellowed.

""This can’t be happening."" Drew whispered, his face was going pale.

Then items got even more recent and… more intimate.

There was a photo of Drew’s car on fire, taken from a distance.

A crumpled letter of recommendation with Drew’s college of choice written in the corner.

It was like someone had been tracking him. Storing his grief and collecting it to satisfy some sick fantasy.

""This is insane,"" Brandon said, backing up.

Then Drew’s phone rang.

He answered, his hands shaking while bringing up the phone.

We heard the voice. Calm and casual, completely unaware of our situation.

""Hey, sorry to call so late at night,"" the antique shop owner said. ""But the man who left that trunk came back. Said he donated it on accident and wanted it returned. He even offered to pay you double what you bought it for.""

Drew blinked. ""We can bring it back tomorrow—""

""No need, he said he was in a rush, so I gave him the motel address. Figured if you guys were still in town he could catch you there. Anyway, He said he’d be there shortly.""

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

As soon as the knocking began the line went dead. The knock itself was soft at first, almost polite.

But it sent a jolt of panic through all of us.

Brandon bolted for the bathroom window, trying to pry it open. Lex ran over to the door, her eyes watering as she fumbled with the chain lock.

“Drew, we gotta go,” I said, grabbing his arm. But Drew was frozen, his eyes locked on the door.

""Why does he have all my stuff?"" Drew mumbled, more to himself than to any of us.

*KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.*

The knocking grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t frantic, just... determined. Whoever was out there knew exactly what they were after.

I yanked Drew toward the window, and Lex got the chain in place. Brandon gave up on the window lock and just smashed the whole thing with the hammer, jumping through after clearing most of the glass. I helped Lex through next.

*BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.*

The door was shaking now. Hinges groaning, barely holding on to the aged wooden frame that looked so old that it would break any second.

""Drew! Come on!"" I yelled, shaking him now. “Hurry, we need to get out of here now!”

But Drew remained, eyes transfixed to the bike bell and belongings spread out on the floor. A display of every single act of cruelty he had ever experienced.

""Was it all caused by something?"" he whispered.

I ran to the window and leapt through. Cutting my arms on the leftover shards of glass. Drew followed, but much slower. He reached his hand out and we grabbed it, yanking.

His head poked through, then his torso. He was nearly out. No easy task as Drew was at least Lex and my weight combined.

That was when the door imploded inward sending wood chips everywhere.

Time seemed to slow to a stop in that moment.

Just behind Drew, I could make out a man standing in the doorframe. Well, it looked like a man at first.

He was tall and pale. He wore a long, outdated-looking coat and his face was hidden by a wide-brimmed hat and shadows that didn’t move with the room.

To this day I swear not another atom moved, everything else in the world was motionless as he stepped inside, slowly and smoothly. Not hurried at all, like he had all the time in the world.

Drew slowly turned his head to look behind him. And as he laid eyes upon the man, Drew let out a blood curdling scream.

Because the man had begun to change.

Its limbs stretched, cracking at unnatural angles. Its arms grew too long, and its fingers began to start splitting to the knuckles. Twisting and curling and shaping into more limbs and appendages. Its face—if you could call it that—began to slide off, revealing layers beneath: eyeless sockets, twitching tendrils of exposed muscle, and a wide, grinning mouth that hadn’t been there before. His coat split down the middle like skin peeling back, revealing a ribcage and stomach that were… wrong. It pulsed, rhythmically, like it was breathing.

Like it was *hungry*.

Then the thing lunged.

It grabbed Drew and violently ripped him from our grasp. Kickstarting the world back into motion.

We all fell back from the sudden force, and I nearly bit my own tongue as I hit the ground.

I scrambled to my feet and through the broken window caught glimpses as it slammed Drew around. First on the ground, then the walls, then against the side table with a sickening, wet crunch... He didn’t move after that.

It paused. And then it began to eat.

It split, unhinging in places a body should never open, and began devouring Drew inch by inch. The wet sound of flesh being torn and bones crunching filled the room as it ate. It chewed methodically and carefully. Like it had waited years to complete this meal, and it wanted savor every. single. piece.

And when it was done… it looked at us.

It had no eyes, but I could feel it staring into my soul. And an icy piercing fear I will never forget, gripped my heart.

We ran.

Brandon had the keys, and we piled in his car, peeling out of the lot, like bats out of hell. In the rearview mirror, I saw the window—just darkness now, but it felt like I was being watched even as we sped away.

The next morning, we tried to piece together what had happened. We went back to the motel, but the clerk said the room was empty. Apparently, it was being renovated and hadn’t been used in months.

This was beyond weird now and when we looked, we couldn’t find our names in the registry. And there wasn’t any charge reflected in our bank accounts.

We asked people in town, but nobody seemed to remember us. While we were showing them the pictures we had taken the previous day around town, I suddenly noticed I couldn’t find Drew anywhere in them.

Not like there weren’t any photos of him to begin with. But the photos I knew I had taken with him in it, no longer showed him anymore.

Like he was never there. Now the photos were of Lex, Brandon, and I standing closer together than I knew we had been before.

We even tried to talk to the police, but without any proof of Drew’s existence or our stay at the motel, they shrugged us off and told us not to waste police time.

Then it started to affect us too.

Brandon forgot first. Then Lex.

They couldn’t recall Drew’s last name, or what he looked like, or why we’d even stopped at the antique shop.

But I remembered. I remembered everything. And for the next thirty years, I carried that memory like a scar.

The only painful memory of a horror that even I had started to believe was all in my head.

Until yesterday, when I saw that trunk again, sitting in the window of another antique shop in another town. My town.

I did say I had been experiencing some bad luck lately. But I bounce back, right? Most people bounce back… right???

I couldn’t stop my curiosity.

I walked inside. The shop was basically empty. Just a few things here and there, with the owner lazily reading a newspaper in the back.

I asked if the trunk was for sale, and he looked at me with a strange expression on his face.

“Trunk, what trunk?”

I pointed to the one in the window and he shrugged so I went up to it myself.

I lifted the lid. And inside, right on top, was a photograph of a younger me, standing next to Drew, holding that same Game Boy.  But the picture was taken from a distance away.

I rushed home in a panic.

I searched my closet; through boxes and boxes of stuff I had held onto throughout the years, until I found it.

The battered, old, blue, Gameboy.

I took it. I never told him. It was an amazing toy, and I have to admit I was jealous at the time. My parents couldn’t afford a Gameboy, and I was sure Drew’s mom would buy him a new one.

Instead, He got grounded. He cried. And I sat in my room, playing his Game Boy, pretending it was mine all along.

That was the first time something went missing for Drew. Not lost like he thought—**taken**.

And some *thing* must’ve seen that.

Maybe it decided Drew was the kind of person who things should be taken from. Maybe it reveled in his punishment and sadness over his own misfortune.

But Drew’s gone now, the misfortune it was feeding off is gone. It ate the dessert and ruined its meal. Maybe that’s the only thing that kept me safe all these years.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

And I think it might be hungry again.",1,1748317988.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

I'm planning to backpack in the Alps this July (by myself) , and I should have about 12-13 days to actually trek.  I plan to mostly camp - some combination of wild camping, formal campgrounds, and requesting to pitch near huts.  Not to say I'd turn down a bed in a rainstorm but I'm not making any reservations.  I was planning on WHR, but I'm a little concerned there will be too much snow still July 10 (when I start), and I'm not sure about the technical areas with a heavy pack.  I'm 42 and a pretty strong backpacker.

I'd love to see some varied terrain - the lush meadows, wildflowers, streams/lakes really call my name, along with the charming alpine villages where I can stop for coffee, pastry, and conversation, and to re-supply on food.  Steep rock and ice is cool, especially in contrast to the green... so I'm not trying to avoid that... it's just not the main purpose of my visit.  I can handle the heights but I'm not in this for the adrenaline rush.  I love a good hard climb on solid track.

I thought I wanted to see the Swiss Alps, but now I'm really not sure.  I'm reading good things about Austria and Slovenia, too... so I'm open minded.  That said, this might be my one chance to trek through the alps, so I've got FOMO in every direction :-)

Any insights or experiences you can share would be appreciated!

Thanks!

1kwds2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/tradwives/comments/1kwds2f/just_some_of_my_thoughts/,Just some of my thoughts!,"I'm 20 at the moment, working on getting my bachelor's by next summer and I want to know how can i learn to be a good wife when that time comes for me.

I have an amazing boyfriend who has traditional values like myself.  He already finished his bachelors and masters and is onto working for our future together.  As much as we would love for me to be a stay at home wife/mom, where he only works for us, in today's economy in America that is not possible anymore.  It's a struggle as young people to become homeowners  who also want children.  We're not sure how we're going to do this, I'm thinking I would need to get a remote job when we start having children--but this is YEARS away for us.  

I would love to marry him sooner than we are thinking, as in like in a year or 2 lol, but there definitely is a lot we have to do before that, which is all financial stuff.  I see so many couples my age today, in 2025, getting married and I'm wondering how they can do it.  

My boyfriend and I are each other's first loves and God-willing, will be each other's only loves, forever.  Him and I only date to marry, that's the best way to do it.  Today our generation is ruined because people have lost sight of this standard, with the huge increase in hook-up culture and untraditional values, as well as wokeness.  I hope we all are like-minded women here, who do not get offended, as we are ""trad"".  But anyways, I'm so excited for my future with him.  God blessed me so much which this man, I feel so loved and cared for, almost to the point that I question if it's real because it's so hard to find this in your first love.  

Anyways, I've definitely ranted a lot! But I want to train myself to be the wife he deserves.  I've been watching a lot of savannahfaithstone and ballerina farm because they are such great role models for me, I believe.  And it seems like these girls have been practicing all of these wife skills for a bit, before they got married.  

I could easily start practicing this, but I'm a bit restricted in certain areas, one of which being diet.  I was born and raised into a Seventh-Day Adventist family, making me a 5th generation Adventist.  If any of you know what that is, it can be very strict depending on how conservative your family is in their beliefs.  One of the main beliefs is that this woman, Ellen White, is a prophet for the church.  They take her writings and words like the gospel, some hold it up to the same level as the Bible and view it as the Bible.  This woman claims to have had visions from God, and it is all very extreme.  A soft, cult-like thing if I may say.  One of her biggest ""inspirations"" from God is veganism.  This means--meat is bad, eggs are bad, dairy is unhealthy, chocolate is bad, coffee is bad, and anything with caffiene is bad.  I'm only allowed to eat vegan foods, and I have started questioning that a lot in the past few years--the religion as a whole.  I've decided to leave it when I am financially able to move out in the next 2 years hopefully.  I have learned the true meaning of the gospel in my search for truth and I have never been more satisfied.

I say all this, because how am I supposed to learn to cook well for my husband if I can't cook good, REAL food.  I want to switch to an animal based diet with a balance of veggies, like he has right now because I believe it is healthier for me.  Men need MEAT also, I'm not about to have him turn into a soy boy lol.  His mom cooks very well and I want him to be able to have good food that he looks forward to.  But it's going to be a bit till I can learn to cook for him.  I guess cooking classes are a great option for now, but I hope my parents won't figure out that I'm not cooking vegan foods.  Eventually I'll tell them I'm no longer vegan and an Adventist, but I cant do that till I leave the house because it's not going to be very fun for me.  

Overall I feel a bit trapped.  My parents are expecting me to have my boyfriend convert to Adventism  before we get married and it stresses me out because what will they do when I say I'm not going to be part of the religion really anymore.  They worked hard to instill the values they believe in, in me, all of their lives of having my sister and I, and I'm so sad if I disappoint them.  I like to tell myself that maybe they will understand more if I say that if I was really serious about Adventism, I would not have dated a man who's an Episcopal.  They fully approve of him also, but they want him to become Adventist for me.  ",1,1748317739.0,tradwives,1,0.67,False

I had worked as a barista at a local coffee shop for 6 months starting last April. I left on good terms after accepting a more flexible role with less hours. 
Recently, I was looking for work, and finding no success decided to reach back out to the coffee shop owners. I messaged both individually and haven’t heard anything back, but I got a read receipt from one of them. I confirmed with an old coworker who said that they were pretty sure it was the correct number. The only reason I can think of that may be why they don’t want me back is that I talked a bit of shit to some of my friends who used to work there, only because I was upset with how certain coworkers were treating me. 

Should I show up in person to try and talk with them, send them an email, or give up?

1kwdlq7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwdlq7,Looking for a new hobby or just something to do? Start collecting pressed pennies! 💰,"# TLDR; I collect smashed pennies and you should, too. It makes for fun little trips to the strip or day trips out of town. 



I saw a comment that said the sub is devolving into your typical Next Door complaint bs and no longer talking about fun things to do. I used to post my adventures and things I was interested in on this sub and people liked it. Then most of my adventures became less Vegas and more Nevada in general location-wise so I stopped posting as much here but hey! I'm still trying to keep myself as busy as ever with finding new and potentially boring-to-you hobbies and interests. I love seeing the beauty in the small things. It makes life much more enjoyable. 

Anyway... to the point! Sorry, I like to yap if I'm in a good mood. Last year I decided to pick up a new hobby... elongated coins otherwise known as smashed or pressed pennies. I had enough of lugging around my childhood piggy bank (literally) from the 90s and started throwing the coins into the machines around town. There are quite a few of them since we live in a tourist area. My collection has grown to over 230 and most of them are from the Vegas/Mojave area. I've even gone on little roadtrips out of town (Goodsprings, Primm, Searchlight, Zion, Pahrump, Baker, Barstow and theres some in Laughlin but I haven't been there for them yet!) just to grab the pennies for something to do to get out of the house for a little bit. Most of the machines are inside so it's something to do in the summer as well. 

They are a nifty little souvenir and possibly one of the cheapest you will find in town. If you find an old school machine, it will run you 51¢ per design. The newer machines come preloaded with newer shiny zinc pennies and often cost a dollar per design or $5 for about 4-8 designs. 

Some of us nerds like to press on pennies older than 1982 because they are made up of the most copper. I do a mixture of both. I was favoring coppers, but I have to get around to figuring out how to clean them so I've been using the shiny new zincs lately.

Even though they are a lot of machines in town, they are often retiring or getting broken and take a long time to fix. I've got several in my collection from town that no longer exist like... Circus Circus recently retired their machines and replaced them with new designs. There were 2 machines at the Mandalay Shark Reef but people are reporting that they have been removed..... 

I find the machines using the website [PennyCollector.com](http://PennyCollector.com) \- you can navigate to a locations list per state and see what machines exist or no longer exist. Users like me make little updates occasionally to keep the website up to date. Just yesterday I drove out to Pahrump because I found out they had a penny machine at a store called Death Valley Marketplace and wanted to get them on the website. 

Here are some of my favorite designs I've personally collected and where you can find them. 

1. **Circus Circus** \- big fan of the new clown design. 
2. **AREA 15** \- really fun bc theres a talking alien inside. it can be too loud to hear what he is saying sometimes. this machine was listed as removed earlier this year, and recently was posted back into the database but i haven't checked on it again personally. sry if its actually gone.
3. **Rainforest Cafe** \- these are some of my favorite in my whole collection. 
4. **Studio 21 Tattoo** \- unique designs! 
5. **Beef Jerky Store** \- i just think the frog is cute
6. **Boulder City - Tom Devlins Monster Museum** \- im running out of ways to say ""this is so cool"" lmao but i hope he will also put one over at the new alien outpost nextdoor as well
7. **Boulder City - The Coffee Cup** \- did you know that the Zoltar machines were created and founded here in BC? get yourself a penny to celebrate if you're a fan
8. **Primm - Buffalo Bills** \- this is actually a pressed quarter! i didn't get to ride the rollercoaster, but i had to get this as a memory before the skeleton of the track bites the dust forever. a little tip.. i've stopped here to get the quarter a few times and i thought the machine was broken because the lights were off. just press very lightly on the back panel and it should work! theres also a penny for the Bonnie and Clyde car.
9. **Pahrump - Death Valley Marketplace** \- the owner was really excited that i was posting them on the collectors website. bring an extra $3 and you can feed some rescue donkeys! worth the drive for sure, imo
10. **Mesquite - Donkey Museum** \- if you want even more donkey content, go to the donkey museum in mesquite! closer than oatman, though they also have some pennies, too!
11. **Amargosa Valley - Alien Cathouse** \- the machine is inside of the alien center market. i only picked up one of them last year before i was into the hobby and i look forward to driving back soon.
12. **California - Cima Mining Co** \- i'm a joshau tree fan so i had to get that one. the peeing one is funny bc they used to have a waterfall themed urinal but they got rid of it. everyone likes to get candy at Eddie World, but i think their bags are too large for 2 people so I get candy here! I like the peanut butter cups!
13. **California - Baker** **Alien Fresh Jerky** \- do you even drive between here and socal if you're not stopping at alien fresh jerky? 
14. **California - Baker Temp 134** \- this is actually my favorite stop in town. billy is really fun to talk to about different adventures you can find off the beaten path. i've also purchased a souvenir of one of the old lightbulbs that used to be in the thermometer before they switched to LED.
15. **California - Barstow Station** \- one of two machines inside Barstow station. i mainly wanted to include it so i could tell you to make sure you also stop at the Del Taco on 1st ave!!!
16. **California - San Bernardino McDonalds Museum** \- fun little quirky stop! i could spend so much time looking at all of the displays. full of happy meal toys from around the world.
17. **Utah - Virgin** \- enough said lol
18. **Utah - Springdale** \- there are several machines around Springdale but this particular one is at Bumbleberry Gift Shop

1kwdjs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kwdjs7/monologues/,Monologues,"Something’s quite reassuring about watching another’s life fall apart. It's understanding that while the frappe in front of me is cold, the honest pause between his question and her answer wouldn’t comfort me. The man I observed from a comfortable distance murmured something indistinctly; I couldn’t make out the woman’s name. Maybe it's that her honest reaction doesn’t pretend, nor does it seem that her heart belonged to her partner. Her glance drifted furtively, almost tellingly. Then, another handsomely dressed man approached her in the distance. 
Not a moment passed before she ran up to embrace the new man. For me, as would any onlooker, the truth was right there, unmistakable in her desire. Jude would have said I envied the lady’s honesty, for while her mind sealed its feelings, the woman’s soul stirred deeply for him. And well, it seemed her lips did too, but as though coming to a realization, she didn’t dilute her honesty any longer, and now here the man was, drowning silently in her rejection. At the same time, I realized I mixed more sugar into a coffee that had already gone cold.
	‘Brutal,’ someone said. I don’t turn to look at who spoke that, but that same part of me silently agrees. It’s strange how he and I confuse our courage in the face of such cruel curtness. In correction, Jude whispers this honesty belongs solely to him, not us. Again, Jude’s right; this honesty demanded the type of bravery I’d never endured the punishment of learning. 
I know it would be human of me to feel something. Sympathy for the rejected man or embarrassment for the mortified woman. But this Wednesday afternoon, I felt neither, and thus no compulsion to comfort one or the other. Thinking about it, Thursday probably wouldn’t offer anything better. *You’re lying again. Not feeling isn’t the same as not caring.* Or maybe it’s just easier for us to pretend they’re the same thing. *Your words, Asher. Never been mine.*
	As Jude’s whispers in my head faded, the reject finally came to his senses and strode along to the café entrance, sitting right next to me. One would assume that he needed some kind of anonymous peace, though his choice of seating gave me pause. Maybe he just wanted a plush seat? I really couldn’t tell. Stirring more sugar into my coffee, I tried ignoring the odd impulse to comfort him. Why would I? I owed him nothing; And besides, I've never been great at sympathizing with emotional woes. Yet, I began feeling quietly uncomfortable watching this stark emptiness, hollowed out by failure. Stirring and sipping my frappe absently, bitterness rose to meet me. 

	I spoke first. “Could’ve been worse. At least now you understand her better than you thought you did.” *Harsh much?* You know I’m not that kind of person.
The man sitting broadside to me stared blankly. ‘Well, fuck you firstly, and secondly, what would you know about me anyhow?’ 
“Enough to know you lost the game,” I said. The words flowed gently, foreign and uncertain to my tongue. “Of course it's never easy; losing the girl of your dreams. But at least you’re wide awake now.” Staring incredulously at what I told him, he dismissed his apprehension and nodded. At first, a grimace, then the man relaxed his face. Tears began silently streaming down his face. It looked like he was contemplating how distant his life would become from this point on. 
Silence settled again onto the situation, but softer this time, less hollow. I looked back at my half-empty frappe, wondering where those words came from. They felt less like mine, but more like the vestiges of an echo. Somewhere deeper, Jude remained quiet, though I saw him smiling. *You’re welcome.* That prick. Sipping my afternoon coffee, the blend tasting quite a bit sweeter, I was saddened to realize there wasn’t much left of it to enjoy.

1kwdjfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kwdjfp/am_i_the_asshole_for_breaking_up_with_my_bf_over/,Am I the asshole for breaking up with my bf over a parking ticket?,"**Am I the asshole for breaking up with my bf over a parking ticket?**

So, my bf (27 male) and I (25 female) have been dating for almost 3 years. We are even in the process of moving in together. That is until tonight...I work in retail so I rarely have weekends off, while he has a desk job and only works weekdays. So we rarely get to spend full days together.

Well my first weekend off in MONTHS comes around and we start the day off at one of our favorite coffee shops. We live in a fairly walkable area, but decided to take his car because it was raining.

While we were getting our coffees his car got a parking ticket - $75 for parking too close to a fire hydrant - and he LOSES IT over this ticket. He actually saw the guy who gave him the ticket and practically chased him down to demand why he was given the ticket. He then immediately demands the number to call and fight the ticket, stays on the phone for 30 minutes to try and talk with someone only to find out he has to write up a reason and email it to our mayor as to why he doesn't deserve this ticket??? Seriously spends an HOUR on this whole thing.

We had tickets to see a movie and he spent the first few minutes of the movie on his phone still writing this letter up to the mayor. I had to nudge him to get off his phone. But it's not only that. He can't talk about ANYTHING else. No conversation is happening outside of him ranting about this ticket, how stupid the officer was for giving it to him, how there were no signs that said he couldn't park there, etc. I even said twice ""hey I really don't want to talk about this anymore."" but he just ignored me. This attitude went on ALL DAY.

We sat through a 3 hour movie and on the way to the car he was talking about this ticket. We went to his place so I could help him pack, conversation is still about the ticket. We would have a few good minutes in between, but somehow he always brought it back to the fucking parking ticket!!

The moment I blew up came after dinner...I made the mistake of suggesting a restaurant close by to where he got the parking ticket. When we sat down I told him he could have ONE more comment about the ticket and then he would have to stop talking about it for the rest of the night. He made his last comment and then we proceeded to actually talk about something else! Finally! We talked more about the movie we saw, about my parents, about the dogs around us, etc. We talked and laughed the rest of dinner.

That was until I made the mistake of drawing his attention to the exact parking spot he got the ticket at. There was a big camper van parked in it with a cute dog in the window. I said ""don't make any comments about the spot, but look how cute that dog it"". He proceeded to BLOW UP. He ran over and took a picture of the van parked there so he could submit it with his documents to prove other people park there without getting ticketed. He said he was going to call the police so they could also get a ticket so it's not just HIM. The whole walk back home was about the ticket again!!!!!! I WAS PISSED. We have one day together that is supposed to be about us and spending time together and he RUINS it over talking about this stupid parking ticket?!?!

So what do I do? I blow up on him. I call him selfish. I yell at him about how he ruined our entire day. I say I don't think I can be with someone who lets one small hiccup ruin an entire day. I mean what if we had kids and this happened?? Would I be the one having to calm our kids down AND him? He was getting upset back telling me I don't care about him. That I'm silencing him and not letting him talk about what's frustrating him. That if roles were reversed he would be on my side and not try to silence me. It was that last comment that sent me over the edge.

By the time we made it back to my place I told him we were done. That he clearly doesn't want someone who tries to make them better, he just wants a yes man and that's not me.

So...am I the asshole? Should I have let him have his rantings and not let it bother me so much? Or am I right to have reacted the way I did? I don't really want to throw away this entire relationship over something that seems so small, but I seriously don't know what to do.",1,1748316923.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False
1kwdi3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1kwdi3u/how_did_you_fix_your_broken_dopamine_system/,"How did you ""fix"" your broken dopamine system?","I'm currently dealing with a dysfunctional dopamine system and looking for advice. I feel ""fried"", and wondering what a good course of action to take is. I have been taking prescribed stimulants since 2019, and while I never abused them, took high doses, and took breaks once in a while, that's still a lot of stimulant use over the years. Mostly used adderall, but last year switched to ritalin, and then most recently switched to Dexedrine. So do I have to take another break from prescribed stimulants? Does that mean no caffeine/coffee for a while either? 

I feel like it could recover pretty quick. I don't feel like it's a dire situation, but it is a big issue right now. I'm in the best physical shape of my life, exercise frequently, get a decent amount of sun, and I've been sleeping surprisingly well recently, so those are things that work in my favor. 

In terms of supplements, I don't want to get too carried away, as I don't want my dopamine reserves to become dependent on supplements to supply the dopamine, I want to heal my system so it works on it's own. I  have ordered some L-theanine. Thinking about taking Uridine for a while. I have tried NALT (N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine) in the past and it always made me feel quite bad for whatever reason (mood goes to shit, primarily). I know that's often recommended, but it's just not for me I don't think. I don't mind a couple of supplements to make the process smoother, but I'm not looking for a stack, necessarily. 

My symptoms are listed below, most notably low motivation/initiative, and that I can't get started on tasks (Even writing this post feels like climbing a mountain, and it's probably all over the place, difficult to focus on it), constantly feeling like I want to do something else but at the same time not wanting to do anything else, a frustratingly-stuck feeling. But the usual symptoms I suppose:

| **Symptoms**                             | Notes                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low motivation or initiative                      | Even small tasks feel overwhelming or pointless            |
| Lack of interest in things you *used to* enjoy    | Hobbies, TV, music, people, etc.                           |
| Can’t get started / executive dysfunction         | Strong sense of inertia, procrastination |
| Anhedonia                                         | Food, music, sex, goals feel “meh” or hollow               |

So all I do is either exercise, play games on my computer/browse online (I'm not into tiktok or instagram type stuff, I'm not getting dopamine hits from endless scrolling as some can get trapped in), eat, and watch a little TV. Not a dire situation, but it's tough to get out of this stuck-ness and overall just dazed/weirdness feeling of what I am guessing is dopamine dysfunction. There's no official test for dopamine, all you can do is guess based on how you're feeling 🤷‍♂️ but I don't know what else it might be. Hopefully it won't take too long to fix, but I realize it could take a while to ""heal"" the dopamine system.",14,1748316790.0,Biohackers,17,1.0,False

She’s never been the spotlight type. She doesn’t dress for red carpets, doesn’t post curated stories, and doesn’t belong in the glossy world of headlines and flashing cameras. She’s the girl behind the scenes—the one who brings him coffee when he’s locked in the studio for 18 hours, the one who slips love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else again. She’s known him long before the world did, before the fame and the tours and the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with him, not the celebrity, but the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday, just a regular Tuesday to him. She doesn’t expect much, never has. Just a few hours. Maybe a walk. Maybe a movie night on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, soft-spoken as ever, and suggests, “Maybe when you're done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.” But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry. Not right away. She just sits in the quiet, one hand pressed over her belly—a new secret, just barely beginning to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And yet she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry. Just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a life she never asked to compete with. Tired of giving everything and receiving almost nothing in return.

\----

I’m looking for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, gut-wrenching, slow-burn story about love, neglect, and the quiet kind of heartbreak that comes from being forgotten. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer or whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his world, unaware of how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

This story will be driven by vulnerability, emotional tension, slow-burn revelations, and the haunting ache of unspoken truths. I’m open to building a world together like past memories, public drama, media pressure, and the weight of what they once had.

2. Mumbai – Where dreams are made… and promptly crushed by rent, local trains, and vada pav that costs more than your childhood.

3. Bengaluru – The only city where you age twice trying to cross Silk Board. Also, everyone’s a tech bro or pretending to be one.

4. Jaipur – The pink city! Or maybe just sun-faded red with royal entry fees. Bonus: Forts that require a hike and a will to live.

5. Kolkata – Ah yes, the city where time slows down to match the trams. Come for the culture, stay because the taxi’s still negotiating fare.

6. Goa – Every Indian’s party dream… until you realize Baga Beach looks like Dadar in swimwear and regret.

7. Manali – Mountains, snow, and 500 tourists with DSLRs trying to “find themselves” in a Maggi stall.

8. Varanasi – Spiritual epicenter with bonus points for surprise monkey theft and holy water that comes with extra seasoning.

9. Chandigarh – Designed by Le Corbusier, now maintained by gym bros and aunties racing on wide roads with no destination.

10. Hyderabad – Biryani capital. That’s it. Don’t ask for directions, they’ll come with 4 historical stories and zero clarity.

11. Pune – Mumbai’s quieter cousin who thinks they're “chill” but really just hates outsiders and sleeps by 10 PM.

12. Ahmedabad – Clean roads, chaotic driving, and “dry state” rules that get magically wet every weekend.

13. Rishikesh – Where yoga is sold like startup equity and every third guy is “healing” from a breakup with a man bun.

14. Shimla – The British came here for summer, now we come here for overpriced Maggie and traffic in the clouds.

15. Indore – Voted cleanest city because apparently, poha + sev also works as detergent.

16. Lucknow – The city of tehzeeb where people politely threaten you with aap ka bhala isi mein hai.

17. Chennai – Coastal city with 2 seasons: Hot and Surface of the Sun. Great filter coffee though — it’s the only thing filtered here.

18. Darjeeling – Postcard-worthy views ruined by traffic, toy trains, and tea so expensive it needs EMI.

19. Kochi – God's Own Country! Also, mosquitoes’ favorite resort and your humidity tolerance exam.

I (28M) met her (let’s call her L) in high school. We were 16, full of feelings, and absolutely convinced we were soulmates. She was the loud, artistic one. I was quiet, bookish, and a little lost. She made me feel like I mattered. Like I was seen.

We dated junior year and part of senior year. But like most teenage love stories… we crashed.

We fought a lot. We were both still figuring ourselves out. She wanted freedom and spontaneity. I needed structure and reassurance. We hurt each other, unintentionally but deeply. Eventually, we broke up a few months before graduation.

It was messy. We stopped talking completely. Went off to different colleges. I saw her on social media living her life, dating new people, moving to different cities. I did the same. Moved on. Mostly.

But she never really left my mind. Not fully.

Fast forward to a year ago. I moved back to my hometown to take care of my dad after his surgery. One random Saturday, I ran into her at a coffee shop. She looked almost the same, but older, softer, more grounded. We made eye contact and both just froze.

She smiled first.

We talked for hours. Then days. Then weeks.

We were different people, but the connection was still there—only this time, it wasn’t chaotic. It was quiet and warm. There was no pretending anymore. No trying to be who we thought the other wanted. Just two grown people who still fit.

She told me she used to dream about that version of us that never got a chance. I told her I never stopped hoping I'd see her again.

One thing that *might* (I say this loosely) improve your acceptance rate and get into at least a Gold tier and possibly get higher paying orders is to go offline or click the coffee cup button to go on break when you're not in a hot spot. So when you do a dropoff and you're like 20 minutes away from civilization, go offline or go on break and drive until you get to a place with plenty of restaurants or wherever orders can come in. Also, when you accept an order, if you have the option/capability to do so, click the coffee cup button so you prevent any orders from trickling in. This prevents orders from getting sent to you until you're in a good area where most orders will start trickling through, and you won't risk declining/ignoring shit orders and keeping your acceptance rate low.

I'm sure most of you are already doing this. Or some of you might think this is a stupid idea. But bear with me: I'm *very* anxious about the change as well. This is for people who are new to this or just haven't thought about it or whatever. **So this advice might not apply to everyone.**

I'm currently a Diamond driver with a 97% satisfaction rate, a 0% cancellation rate, and a 100% on time rate. I know and am really sad and frustrated that I'm going to get demoted when the June 3rd change comes in. I love this job, I love the people I interact and engage with, I love the animals I get to meet and give pets to, and I am damn good at what I do. Yes it's a driver job but I'm so proud of the work I do. I'm pissed at Uber because I feel like I'm being punished for something I didn't do just to help other people make more money and me getting screwed over for doing a good job.

**But y'all, my acceptance rate less than a week ago was 14% but when I started doing this, it got bumped up to 17%.**

I just wanted to share to help anybody out if it does. It doesn't hurt to try if you haven't already. I was debating on sharing this. If you already do this, fantastic! If you're going to be mean or condescending about somebody offering SOMEthing, you're not helping and I'm not going to argue and bitch with people who are going to throw temper tantrums.",2,1748315711.0,UberEatsDrivers,0,0.67,False

1kwd4jc,https://www.thecut.com/article/influencer-liv-schmidt-subscriber-group-chat-weight-loss.html,"In Liv Schmidt’s subscriber-only group, members encourage one another to eat as little as possible: “It’s, Like, This Little Cult of Being Skinny”","Last year, Emma, a 37-year-old teacher, broke up with her boyfriend. He had often taunted her for her weight, leaving snarky Post-it notes on her clothes and telling her she needed to eat better. “He told me I was so fat that no one else would ever love me,” she said. After they broke up, his words still haunted Emma (who asked to use a pseudonym for privacy). She spent a lot of time scrolling through #SkinnyTok, a growing community of weight-loss influencers, where she found Liv Schmidt.

A 23-year-old model in New York City, Schmidt encourages her followers to “live the Skinni Girl lifestyle” by following her weight-loss advice. When Emma stumbled on her TikTok, Schmidt had more than 600,000 followers. She was shocked by some of the things Schmidt said — in one video, she mocks women who wear sundresses to hide their “puffy face and bloated bodies,” and she once reposted a TikTok with the caption “girls be 300 pounds saying ‘I’m a snack.’ No megatron you’re the fkn vending machine.” Emma was intrigued. “I just figured, Okay, if she was able to get that thin, she could help me lose that last 15 pounds,” she told me. Emma signed up for the Skinni Société, Schmidt’s subscription-only Instagram group. For $20 a month, members gain access to exclusive content on Schmidt’s Instagram page, including recipes, workout videos, and diaries of everything she eats in a day. They’re also added to a group DM thread on the platform, where they share their weight-loss goals and progress. When Emma joined, she saw members posting their step counts, meal plans, and before-and-after photos. She couldn’t help but notice many were quite young; some appeared to be in college or high school, posting about graduation or sharing prom pics. “I felt like I was old enough to be their mother,” she said.

During her time in the Skinni Société, Emma’s life became dominated by a single obsession: food — and how to avoid eating it. She frequently felt weak and exhausted. At one point, she said, she had been on the treadmill at the gym for a minute when she had to get off; she was lightheaded and drenched in sweat. Every time she opened the app, she saw a new video or message from Schmidt urging her followers to “eat clean, feel light” or to chug water or green tea to trick their bodies into ignoring hunger cues. Her subscribers couldn’t get enough. “They’re all so obsessive, so it’s hard to not become obsessive too,” Emma said. “It’s, like, this little cult of being skinny.”

In interviews, Schmidt — who didn’t respond to requests for comment — has claimed she merely offers common-sense weight-loss advice. The goal of the Skinni Société, she says, is to hold members accountable and support their goals. But where is the line between embracing diet culture and promoting eating disorders?Inside the group, members post ridiculously high step counts and commiserate over the side effects of their low-calorie diets, like hair loss and dizziness. Though the group is technically closed to those under 18, when I joined I found more than a dozen members who are high-school students, one of whom is a freshman.

Last fall, Schmidt was kicked off TikTok after The Wall Street Journal asked the platform for comment on a story about her. Her fans rallied to her defense, and she made the ban part of her brand, arguing that she’s the victim of censorship. In April, the conservative women’s magazine Evie featured her in a glowing profile with the headline “Banned for Being Honest?” Now she’s more popular than ever and has quadrupled her follower count on Instagram. Air Mailrecently estimated that Schmidt makes $130,000 a month from the 6,500 members in the Skinni Société. She takes the influencer playbook a step further, directly profiting from a little club of followers who encourage one another to eat, drink, and live just like Liv Schmidt.In March, she reposted a message from a follower who wrote a school paper about how much she looks up to Schmidt. “Her content has helped and continues to help so many young girls form a healthy relationship with food and exercise,” this fan wrote. “She truly exemplifies the values of what a role model should be.”

In Schmidt’s videos, she’s usually clutching a tea or a green juice and wearing a slinky black athleisure set, her lips glossed and her long blonde hair pulled back from her face as she demonstrates her five-minute ab workout or posts behind-the-scenes content from modeling photo shoots. She comes across as a knowing older-sister type, the sorority big who has her shit together and can get you into all the best parties. “I’m going to hold your hand when I say this: You’re doing everything right except this one thing,” Schmidt says in one recent video about why you’re not losing weight. “You’re a smart girl. You just need to stop overeating and eat less.” Her subscriber-only grid features glamorous black-and-white stock photos of svelte models on yachts or in Italian piazzas, sipping coffee or demurely slipping on designer sunglasses, with captions like “What to Do When People Comment On Your Food” and “How I Stay Silent, Skinny, and Unbothered.” In Schmidt’s world, thinness isn’t just a physical state but the basis of an entire luxury lifestyle.

Schmidt is capitalizing on a cultural moment when extreme thinness has become more acceptable. Though she has the largest following of the SkinnyTok influencers, there’s also Amanda Dobler, a “fat loss and mindset coach” who makes videos enumerating “things you’re doing that are keeping you stuck and fat,” and Mandana Zarghami, a Miami-based influencer with almost 350,000 TikTok followers who lectures followers who are “built like a buffalo big back” or “a little linebacker.” These women exhort their followers in a blunt, tell-it-like-it-is tone to ignore the impulse to eat and focus on self-discipline and control. Dobler told me SkinnyTok isn’t about promoting eating disorders but about “showing women they’re allowed to want more for themselves.” “Tracking your food doesn’t mean you’re obsessive,” she said. “It means you’re informed.”

Both TikTok and Meta, Instagram’s parent company, have policies against encouraging eating disorders. But if you search skinny or SkinnyTok on TikTok and Instagram, in addition to a warning and a list of resources for people struggling with eating disorders, you’ll also see thousands of videos of very thin women showing off their extremely low-calorie diets. Meta’s policies, a spokesperson told me, attempt to strike a balance between removing potentially dangerous pro-anorexia content and providing a space for people to talk openly about recovery. The company’s attitude toward ED content seems to be “We know it when we see it.”

Still, Schmidt is careful. She uses language that frames choosing not to eat as empowering, even feminist. “Eat like you’re the main character. Because you are,” she writes in one post. “Eat like your highest self is watching. Eat like your next weigh-in is tomorrow.” She doesn’t advocate for a specific diet or tell her followers to avoid specific foods, which differentiates her from most weight-loss influencers. Her rule of thumb is simple: Eat whatever you want — just eat as little as possible. “You’re not restricting. You’re ‘regulating.’ It’s chic,” she says in another post, next to a photo of a woman in a scarf and sunglasses in front of the Eiffel Tower.

As someone who spent a lot of time on ED Tumblr as a teenager, obsessively reblogging images of Calvin Klein–era Kate Moss and Cassie from Skins, I understood Schmidt’s appeal. This community aestheticized the brutal, private experience of slowly starving myself, rendering it both visible and communal; I wanted to know if the Skinni Société served the same purpose for Schmidt’s fans. When I signed up, I got access to her subscriber-only content and main group chat, the Skinni Société Secrets. There are also 21 different group threads, which have about 220 members each; other than a chat for moms and one specifically for Europeans, they’re otherwise indistinguishable, and I chose one at random.

I knew that my history of disordered eating could make me vulnerable to Schmidt’s advice, but I also hoped that nearly a decade of therapy would protect me. It didn’t. I thought about Schmidt and the thread basically every waking moment. I did her arm exercises while making breakfast for my toddler. I swapped out my morning bagel for a protein shake, my lunch for a bag of popcorn and a LaCroix. I added her recommended fiber supplements to my morning coffee so I would feel fuller sooner. I checked my step count religiously, and every time I was hungry for a snack in the middle of the night — which was quite often, considering how few calories I was consuming — I told myself, The kitchen is closed, one of Schmidt’s mantras. It was like a dormant part of my brain had been switched on: All I could think about was being skinny, because that was all everyone in my DMs was thinking about, too. Schmidt hadn’t eliminated any “food noise.” She had turned up the volume to the point that it was deafening.

“It feels like everyone is enabling each other’s eating disorders,” Annie, a 20-year-old former member of the group, told me. She joined the Skinni Société because she had gained a little bit of weight in recovery from anorexia, and Schmidt’s advice seemed simple and straightforward enough: Eat less and walk more. It didn’t take long, however, for Annie to realize that there was something wrong. “It was extremely competitive — who could eat less, who weighed less, who was living the most ‘skinni’ lifestyle,” she said. One member, Annie said, had a history of binge-eating and would regularly post photos of her meals, which consisted solely of vegetables. “The girls would praise her and support her,” she said. “No one thought to advise her toward possibly seeking professional help.”

Some former members I spoke with said the women in their chat would regularly discuss experiencing dizziness, fatigue, and brain fog. Emma told me that people often talked about their periods becoming irregular or experiencing hair loss, two common side effects of disordered eating. “None of the members in the group said, ‘Maybe you should chill out,’” she said. “They just recommended hair vitamins to each other.” Another woman, who joined the Skinni Société to lose weight after giving birth, told me she saw some members eating less than 1,000 calories a day (going against Schmidt’s guidelines to not post meal plans less than 1,200 calories). I also saw women exchanging tips: One said she puts on mouth tape after dinner to deter nighttime snacking, while another said she used prunes as laxatives whenever she feels “heavy.” One woman posted a screenshot showing she’d taken 27,000 steps in one day. Five other members hearted it. “Congratulations,” one wrote alongside balloon and Champagne-bottle emoji.

Periodically, I’d leave one Skinni Société group chat and join another so I could get a representative sample. And this was the case in virtually every chat I joined: The members didn’t treat it as a weight-loss “accountability” group, as Schmidt refers to it, but as an opportunity to one-up each other. They congratulated one another for making it through social events without eating too much or berated themselves for having a few bites of cupcake.

Schmidt doesn’t appear to monitor the private group chats, only occasionally posting copy-paste prompts (“how is everyone staying Skinni this weekend?”), though shereminds members that she’s not qualified to treat eating disorders. In a message on the Skinni Société Secrets main thread last month, she wrote that the group is “not a binge eating recovery community, nor is it a starvation or extreme diet community,” and that those struggling with disordered eating should seek professional help.

Is she responsible for what they do? The Skinni Société is a weight-loss group, and those who join it know what they’re signing up for. As Schmidt writes in her community guidelines, “You will be eating less than normal if your goal is weight loss. That’s science.” Still, it’s one thing to build a community for adults to encourage one another to starve themselves; it’s another to let in teenagers. Though Schmidt says the group is open only to “biological girls” over the age of 18, she didn’t verify my age when I joined, and three people told me they noticed members in the group chat whom they believed to be in high school because they referred to homework. I easily found at least 12 members who listed their high schools in their bios, and I confirmed their ages by cross-referencing with their other social-media profiles. A member in one thread recently mentioned that she was graduating high school that day. “Congrats,” another member wrote. “You’ll be the skinniest girl at your graduation :).”

When I reached out to Meta to share my reporting on the group — including screenshots showing extremely low-calorie food diaries and Schmidt’s advice on chugging water and tea to stay full — a spokesperson said that the company has“taken action on several pieces of content from this account for breaking our rules” but did not specify what content had been removed. “If we find repeated violations we’ll take further action, which could include removing the account completely,” the spokesperson said. After this story was published, Meta said, “After careful review, we’ve restricted this account so it’s only visible to people over 18 and it’s no longer able to offer subscriptions or use any of our other monetization tools.”

Schmidt says she has never had an eating disorder. Her own exercise and meal diaries show she does at least one workout and walks a minimum of 15,000 steps a day. Her meals include “electrolytes, green tea, honey, Greek yogurt” for breakfast and “a green salad, a few almonds and mustard, two cups of mint tea and honey” for lunch. “It’s a very low-calorie eating plan, obviously,” Melainie Rogers, a certified dietitian and nutritionist told me when I showed her some of Schmidt’s food diaries. “What she’s eating is not enough to sustain her even without activity.” Recommending such a plan to her followers is dangerous for those at risk of developing eating disorders, Rogers said.

I get Schmidt’s all-consuming obsession with thinness. Eating disorders are one of the deadliest and most difficult illnesses to treat. Once you start hearing a little voice whispering in your ear, telling you to restrict or binge or purge or go on the treadmill or go for a walk, it’s incredibly hard to stop listening to it.

Perhaps that explains, at least in part, why the group-chat members are so loyal to Schmidt. She often reposts DMs she receives from followers thanking her for changing their lives. “People idolized her,” Emma said. “They would kind of beat themselves up over their food diaries because they wanted theirs to look just like hers, and maybe they had, like, nine extra calories that day.” Emma ultimately left the group, allowing her subscription to lapse when she realized how little Schmidt was eating. “I was like, Dang, a child eats more than this,” she said.

Alison, a 28-year-old with a history of binge-eating, also left the Skinni Société just a few months after she joined. Like others in the group, she started experiencing physical side effects like dizziness and fatigue. “Liv would say this is normal, as your body is adapting to losing weight,” she said. More than anything else during her time in the group, Alison was struck by just how much Schmidt inculcated her followers with a deep obsession with food, despite claiming that she would teach people to think about it less. “All she ever spoke about was food,” she said. “She would talk about being hungry, how she’s looking forward to her next meal, how the amount of time she put into being skinny was suffocating. It’s actually pretty sad.”

Alison now regularly posts about Schmidt on Reddit snark pages, urging those who have signed up for the Skinni Société to ask Instagram for refunds. Schmidt has started threatening followers with legal action if they leak outside the group. “Please don’t join my subscription, consume the content, and then dispute it. If you don’t like it, just leave,” she wrote in one message.

In a bid to increase her engagement, Schmidt recently announced a “Skinni Société Ambassador program,” which includes access to exclusive events with her, like a “candlelit Pilates experience,” as well as gift cards and free products, like under-eye patches from the skin-care brand NūFace. Ambassadors are selected based on how frequently they promote the Skinni Société on their accounts, including by posting meals, step counts, and walking videos with Schmidt’s new hashtag #NotFatToday.

I’m still trying to find ways to tune out Schmidt’s voice. I’ve muted her on Instagram and deleted the Skinni Société thread. But one of the scariest things about having an eating disorder is knowing that you’ll have to fight it the rest of your life. Those I spoke to felt the same way. “Since the age of 13, I’ve been tracking calories and always striving to be skinny,” Annie said. “After joining this group, I realized that I don’t see this thought process ending anytime soon.” She said there were women “as old as 28” in her group thread who were obsessed with being thin. “I fear my life will be the same,” she said. As someone who is much older than 28, I wanted to tell her honestly that there are more important things in life than being thin. What I couldn’t tell her honestly is that the noise will ever stop.

1kwd49w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1kwd49w/why_is_it_so_hard_to_just_leave/,Why is it so hard to just leave?,"Hi all!

First post on reddit but have lurked in this group for some time.
Hoping for some comraderie, and perhaps some advice from people in similar situations or once were.

I come from a childhood of suicide and mental illness. Suffice to say, I turn everything inwards and like everyone these days, have my struggles.
I feel and think broken, but I know I'm not. I'm strong. I can and do withstand so much, so my question is;
Is this life and love, or am I just surviving?




I'll try to be brief;
Yes I (29F) am finally in therapy, having tried a few times over the years and never clicking or feeling safe before this one.
My Husband (31M) says he's doing therapy but so far has had one session despite my alternating encouragement amd nagging.

I've asked for couples therapy for years. This for me is worrisome, as we finally have a session this Wednesday but the fact it's taken so long and I'm at this point before he agreed hurts to think about.


So, why am I on this page?
Because my husband is a high functioning alcoholic.
Over the past few years, with me fully noticing around a year into our marriage, he was always drunk. I'm talking cheapest giant plastic bottle of vodka sipping from it like a milk bottle every single day drunk.
Listening to him vomit up his guts every. Single. Weekend.
Begging me Sunday evening as he shivered from withdrawals and drunkeness not to send him to work. (I never made him btw. I would say how my wages were enough, we'd make it work etc etc) Mondays off with a ""tummy bug"" and sometimes Tuesdays too.
Gaslighting. Hurtful things said again and again with no memory, and irritation that I didn't want to cuddle and kiss the morning after.

Fights, begging, crying, sleeping all day, unscrewing off the bathroom door so he could finish his nonsensical arguement, changing the bank password, putting tracking on my phone, or whatever it was that day. Every weekend, living on power saving mode, trying not to wake him and waiting for Blessed Monday morning.
The thing that bugs me is I have all these negative memories. And for him, nothing happened.
He'll apologise, and then think we can go back to our loving life. And I get to remember. 

It's like Jekyll and Hyde.
Because my Husband is a good man. He works hard, is set for a promotion soon and truly busts ass every. single. day.
Every day, he'll send me a text saying I'm beautiful and he loves me and he can't wait to see me that evening. He used to make me coffee every morning before he left for work (I asked him to stop to lower my caffeine anxiety) and dotes on me those few, sober and non-exhausted moments we have. He tells me again and again how much he loves me, how much I mean to him, how he's gonna provide me with a good life. His words are so hopeful, sweet, convincing. They lull me into a calm, into just doing our usual routine, not questioning or fighting the flow. He wraps me into a hug, his arms around me and I am home. I melt, my brain chatter stops. Everything will be OK. We'll make it work. He loves me. I'm home.


But even our home life has problems. He lied about drinking and hid bottles last year when I couldn't stand it any more, and despite cutting down significantly still isn't completely honest when I ask. It's 50:50 is he already drunk and lying, or sober and telling the truth/white lie?
He'll lie about the stupidest things when drinking, and he's so good at masking it until he's absolutely plastered. It makes me question every converstaion we've ever had.
He works 70 plus hours (no overtime) a week at a 40 hour job because he wants a promotion and uses that as an excuse or is simply just too tired and never home so I do 85%> of the household tasks because I refuse to live in a messy home and only work 40 hours.
When he is home, the severe exhaustion, stress and depression he is under makes him unpleasant to be around, to the point where I would honestly rather be alone these days than talk to him and see the dead in his eyes or his work phone in hand and he can't even hear me.

The last two outtings I planned, the first he got so high (I don't mind that as much as the drinking) that he slept through the entire movie, snoring, and then could barely walk straight out of the cinema so I cancelled the rest of the date and drove us home, distraught. The next, we were hanging out with my friends in the evening and I came home from work and he couldn't even stand. Recently, we visited his sister and he made a complete fool of himself.
The 2am suicide mutterings in full swing.
It's less often, but it's still happening. Nothing has changed it feels in all these years.
Except, it feels like he doesn't apologise anymore. He stays quiet and I feel like all I do is blame him, kicking a dog when it's already so down but what else can I do? I can't change his behaviours. No matter how nice I make our home, how pleasant I am, how much I forgive, it never changes.


Let's not even talk about s*x because we all know that isn't happening and it's entirely my fault. I can't stand him touching me sexually. Vague fondling with half-hearted attempts, I can't summon the desire to even pretend anymore. And as I'm clearly not into it he leaves me be but the frustration and bitterness is evident daily.


The last thing worth mentioning (sorry, this has just become a long moan but I suppose that's therapeutic in it's own way?) is that I am from England. I moved here when we married, and at the time my Husband had his own construction business and I was going to learn planning and work alongside him remodeling and building homes.
Various reasons caused us to move, I landed a decent paying dead-end job and he ended up getting this corporate job that he loves dearly. He says he finally found something he cares about. Passion for his work. Everyone there loves him because they get the best of him. He's always smiling. He's always there when they call, helps out, stays late, and nobody sees the darkness he lets out at home. The suicidal mutterings at 2am. The negativity about his colleagues. So, I get why he prefers being at work. I'm probably not that much fun to be around anymore. I'm closed off and protected. But, at the beginning I supported him with every ounce of my being and was still neglected. I would beg, crying for dates and he would show me on his calandar all the meetings etc and how he couldn't schedule a date because he might be needed and didn't want to let me down. One Saturday was blocked off to see a colleagues band. I will never forget that. But he was probably drunk and I shouldn't hold that against him, right?

I feel like I've been through years of mental siege. But people I've confided in tell me he's not abusive, he clearly loves me, and it's not all that bad we just need a little couples therapy. I find myself wishing he'd just hit me or cheat and then it would be clear what to do.

We were so good. Our love is still SO strong. But is it enough? Part of me says I should have left already and it's too far gone. Part of me says it's too early to throw in the towel and I should believe him one more time. He will be better if I just try hard enough, if I just stopped protecting myself from possible hurt and loved him with everything I have.

But really, I just want to stop hurting and whatever I choose seems to just be more pain?

I'm planning to backpack in the Alps this July (by myself) , and I should have about 12-13 days to actually trek. I plan to mostly camp - some combination of wild camping, formal campgrounds, and requesting to pitch near huts.  Not to say I'd turn down a bed in a rainstorm but I'm not making any reservations. I was planning on WHR, but I'm a little concerned there will be too much snow still July 10 (when I start), and I'm not sure about the technical areas with a heavy pack.  I'm 42 and a pretty strong backpacker.

I'd love to see some varied terrain - the lush meadows, wildflowers, streams/lakes really call my name, along with the charming alpine villages where I can stop for a coffee and conversation, and to re-supply on food.  Steep rock and ice is cool, especially in contrast to the green... so I'm not trying to avoid that... it's just not the main purpose of my visit.  I can handle the heights but I'm not in this for the adrenaline rush.  I love a good hard climb on solid track.

I thought I wanted to see the Swiss Alps, but now I'm really not sure.  I'm reading good things about Austria and Slovenia, too... so I'm open minded.  That said, this might be my one chance to trek through the alps, so I've got FOMO in every direction :-)

Any insights or experiences you can share would be appreciated!

1kwd0ci,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwd0ci,"Korea Hyatt Review (GH ICN, Jeju, PH Seoul)","tl;dr: Grand Hyatt Incheon and Jeju are awesome. Park Hyatt Seoul is a bit mid for the price.

Just wrapped up a trip to Korea (what a lovely country), I primarily stayed in a few Hyatts during this trip.

Grand Hyatt Incheon (9/10): I started with Grand Hyatt Incheon Airport [previous stay photos since it's the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1i0ucum/grand_hyatt_icn/). There’s all the memes about Hyatt’s love for airport hotels, but this really is quite a nice hotel. First of all, it’s super cheap, maybe like $100ish or so a night. It’s a great place to stay on arrival or connections since ICN airport is so far from the city, it can take up to 2 hours to get to the city center. I was upgraded again to their “Residence One” room which I’ve shared pics of before. The club lounge is a great value, they had tons of high quality snacks and food, more than enough for a meal (dumplings, pulled pork, fried chicken, salad, charcuterie, noodles, etc.). The only gripe I have is the shuttle is only every 30 minutes, so you could be waiting a while on arrival, I wish they would increase the frequency to every 15 or 20 minutes, but I suppose that might be too often. Facilities are all quite large and because it’s an airport hotels, it never gets that crowded. I give this hotel a 9/10, one point off for the slow shuttle bus.

Grand Hyatt Jeju (8.5/10): Afterwards, I went to the famous Jeju island and stayed at Grand Hyatt Jeju. This hotel is super close to CJU airport, where you’ll arrive, no more than a 10m taxi ride. This is more of a resort-type property, where there’s tons of restaurants and shops connected. I used a SUA as I was staying for a week to confirm a suite upgrade to a Grand Suite. Although, their base rooms already look quite large from the photos. The price is a bargain yet again, I want to say it’s around $150/night. Their club lounge serves breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktail hour. I will say after the 3rd or 4th day, the food got a little stale. The quality was good, in general, they have Western breakfast (eggs, potatoes, sausage/bacon, toast), Korean options (bulgogi, side dishes, rice, noodle soup), and then continental fare (yogurt, fruit, pastries, etc.) The coffee is Nespresso, didn’t taste great tbh. They do serve breakfast in one of their other many restaurants as well. In terms of afternoon tea, I only went once, but it was basically snacks (chips, nuts, etc.) + pastries. The cocktail hour was much more substantial, and got very busy. They typically had a noodle soup of sorts (udon, ramen, pho) and then some snack-type hot dishes served on small plates. It’s good enough for a light dinner, but you might end up wanting something more substantial later. Otherwise, they had tons of dining options in the hotel, ranging from a Chinese restaurant, hot pot, Korean BBQ, deli, food court, etc. There’s also a 7/11 convenience store as well. One thing to note is that because Jeju is so popular and close to China/Korea, the place gets packed on the weekends. The amount of people I saw in the hotel using the facilities like the gym doubled to tripled over the weekend. I’m not sure what the local Koreans think of GH Jeju, but this placed seemed rampant with Chinese nationals, as I think they get visa-free entry when flying directly into Jeju. Overall, considering how cheap it is, I would definitely recommend it again. I give this hotel an 8.5/10, it’s pretty well-rounded.

Park Hyatt Seoul (6.5/10): Finally, I wrapped it up with a stay at Park Hyatt Seoul (no photos because it was just a really basic room). I think true to the online sentiment, it’s a bit underwhelming as a Park Hyatt. I booked with Amex FHR to use my credit, you get the usual treatment and the $100 credit, which I used at their Italian restaurant, Cornerstone. Food was good, but pricy. Their breakfast menu was alright, but didn’t have too many options, literally just one page for both drinks and made to order, most dishes were egg related, and then French toast/waffles. I had seen a review where they had the Korean pancakes and was looking forward to it, but I guess it must’ve been cycled out. I think the main highlight for me was their Hanwoo prime rib they served at a chef station in the morning, was super juicy and delicious. Otherwise, I had their bibimbap and Belgian waffles, both of which were just ok. Compared to top tier Park Hyatt breakfasts at places like Kyoto, Jakarta, Bangkok, or Sydney, this was on the weaker end. I’d also add the service seemed a bit weak to me, although, it could also be a Korean service culture thing. I felt that the staff at other PHs seemed a bit more friendly and service was more individualized. PH Seoul seemed to just focus on getting the job done and it was a bit robotic. Considering this is not a cheap SE Asia hotel like PH Bangkok or Jakarta, which are in the $200/night range, you definitely feel the difference in value. I wouldn’t not stay here again, but I just don’t feel it has that exceptional Park Hyatt-ness that I’ve come to expect at other Park Hyatts. I also think considering how great the other Korea Hyatts were, I was a bit let down. Given the smaller Hyatt footprint in Seoul, you often don’t have much of a choice where to stay anyways (I think it’s just this, the Andaz, and the GH), you’ll probably end up here one way or another, just don’t expect anything “amazing”. For me, I’d say this is a 6.5/10 hotel, judging from the lens of its cost as well as PH and 5* luxury standards. 

Unfortunately, this is where the limited Hyatt footprint hurts, there's just not much other options in the Seoul metro.",6,1748315145.0,hyatt,6,1.0,False

I'm planning to backpack in the Alps this July (by myself) , and I should have about 12-13 days to actually trek. I plan to mostly camp - some combination of wild camping, formal campgrounds, and requesting to pitch near huts.  Not to say I'd turn down a bed in a rainstorm but I'm not making any reservations.  I was planning on WHR, but I'm a little concerned there will be too much snow still July 10 (when I start), and I'm not sure about the technical areas with a heavy pack.  I'm 42 and a pretty strong backpacker.

I'd love to see some varied terrain - the lush meadows, wildflowers, streams/lakes really call my name, along with the charming alpine villages where I can stop for a coffee and conversation, and to re-supply on food.  Steep rock and ice is cool, especially in contrast to the green... so I'm not trying to avoid that... it's just not the main purpose of my visit.  I can handle the heights but I'm not in this for the adrenaline rush.  I love a good hard climb on solid track.

I thought I wanted to see the Swiss Alps, but now I'm really not sure.  I'm reading good things about Austria and Slovenia, too... so I'm open minded.  That said, this might be my one chance to trek through the alps, so I've got FOMO in every direction :-)

Any insights or experiences you can share would be appreciated!

Thanks!

I set up a home wash station - wheeled cart, pressure washer, foam cannons, a graveyard of microfiber towels, the usual suspects. Lot’s of products from posts I’ve read here. Appreciate the knowledge you all are so willing to share!

The problem? Water spots. Instant, apocalyptic water spots. I’m convinced my house water comes from a cave made of calcium and spite. I’ve tried keeping the car coated in foam like a giant marshmallow, but by the time I rinse, it looks like I washed with milk.

The good news: I’ve got a decent budget to fix this. I’ve seen some people run DI water through a bypass just for the final rinse, but what happens if I just say “forget it” and do the whole process with DI water? I’m doing 5-6 washes per month, and it’s only nice enough for about half the year to do this where I live.

By the time I pay $15-$20 at a self-serve bay every time, I could probably build a small water lab in my garage. Speaking of which-already have an RO system for my coffee setup (yes, I’m that guy), and I’m getting a softener installed soon too.

Would love thoughts on:
	•	Full DI washes: wasteful overkill or secret weapon?
	•	Specific setups or brands that won’t turn this into another DIY rabbit hole
	•	Whether I’ll just be replacing water spots with salt spots if I wash with softened water
	•	If it’s worth plumbing a dedicated wash outlet

Thanks for reading my TED talk. Appreciate any tips before I go full mad scientist in my garage.

**Summary:**

In a search for clarity Fahim quits his job and decides to hike the Appalachian trail. Starting in North Carolina it becomes apparent the conditions are not ideal- his depression is kicking in, he's not running into other hikers, and he thinks he may be seriously lost. He stumbles upon a family living in the woods, a father daughter duo named Walter and Alyssa, that are both self-sustaining and working for the government on projects that have been handed down through generations. As Fahim gathers his bearings with this host family he's met with more questions than answers on what exactly Walter and Alyssa are doing in the wilderness and how against his wishes, his past will inevitably come back to haunt him. 

  


**First few paragraphs of the First Chapter \*\*Depression warning\*\***



*I wish I had a breaking moment to tell. That’s what people want to hear, the ashes of the fire, the phoenix. What it takes to pull a trigger. I thought moments like that existed too, and they probably do for the more impulsive among us. But that’s not what happened to me. If anything, I knew too long that it was coming to an end. Years. Decades. What exactly was ending, I couldn’t say. Some days it felt like my lease, my career, my long-term relationship. But most of the time it was my life, more indefinite as the weeks passed. Every miniscule moment evolved into a glacial press of dread, until all I could think of was how to get out of it, how to roll to the other end before it collapsed on me. I began wondering if a person could will their body to its demise. Stage four cancer patients did it, demanding their organs hold on another month, another year despite the odds. If that was true couldn’t a person then, in theory, will their cells to die? If surviving a lit-up scan of tumors was a documented possibility then there must exist an opposite. There must be a way to convince your insides to perish. To pause, to wilt, to pause all osmosis.* 

 

*To stop.*  

 

*Its more of a shock I never flipped the switch before. It was a vast, strange magic that kept me alive. I was my own lab rat study, intrigued at my ability to file taxes, call the dentist, buy groceries at the store, moving around with the same masked diplomacy all while wondering when it will all end, taking my last breath. Where had I learned resilience like that? Was it something I learned? Was that something a person couldlearn? Is that what Darwin meant, when he talked about natural progression, about each generation persevering the last? I didn’t understand this immense will I couldn’t grasp at myself, being the final voice to decide I will live, whether I like it or not. I would test these instincts, wondering if the time I spent in them would wake me from its slumber. I would create tests, aimless exertions, trying to find my limits. How it feels to stand barefoot in the snow for twenty minutes. Thirty. How it feels to dip a finger into boiling water until I can feel my heart beating in every limb of my body. I found that if I held my breath for too long something would come in and stop it, push me out of the way. I knew it wasn’t me because I would never have allowed it to happen so flawlessly, so unbearably perfect with an unwavering confidence to live. Because that type of thinking was never me, could never be me. I would always doubt if it was worth it to go on. And I would always resent myself when I inevitably did.* 

 

*This cycle continued for years until I learned that yes, you could go on living like this. You didn’t have to like anything at all. You didn’t even have to want to be alive. Your body just had to keep breathing.* 



*Most of my days were a silent struggle but I did have my share of outbursts. One day at work I yelled at my desk. Just like that, huffing and red faced, until my coworkers turned to stare. There was no reason for it, no broken phone, no printer out of ink. I just screamed, just like that. Out of me. It surprised everyone, including myself, and I quickly grabbed the head of a stapler to put it over my hand, acting as if I accidently punctured myself. Looking back it must have been quite a play to see, a grown man fake stapling himself, though they acted like they believed it. Some of them came up to me and ask if I was OK. I told them I was fine and that was that. A receptionist I used to talk to offered to buy me lunch or coffee. That was nice. But my boss, who had been several desks down, did nothing to reprimand me or point out the interruption. I thought there would be a meeting, an awful discussion of workplace tolerance and write-ups but the existence of it died in the same hideous way my voice ceased at its end; croaking and hollow. It alarmed me, the response it had. It made me think of other responses, to worse things. I made me almost want to do it again.*  

 

*In the same year I learned how difficult it was to get fired. Almost all of my reports were garbage. I joined meetings late, ten or twenty minutes after they began. I came in with unnamable stains on my dress shirts; ketchup, coffee, soy sauce, most from the week before. There was no direct outing but I could see in my portfolio that my performance record went down and I received an HR call asking if I had any dependents, which may or may not have been related but I took it that way. I wasn’t scared of being fired. In a way, I was looking forward to it, high on the idea of having hours to myself, getting to be outside instead of in a grey, plastic purgatory. I told myself that this was what I wanted, a nice hefty severance to start my life over, and then I would get my act together, get a master’s degree, become a black belt. But they never axed me. Instead, I was told at quarterly one on ones that it was clear I was going through something, and that’s alright. I would get a pat on the back and the advice to go for a walk, try a meditation app, write ten good things a day. I wish that was all I needed, to go for a walk. I found myself in a silent shock, absorbing the reactions around me, or the complete dulling lack of them. The way they painted the solutions to these problems, as if it were a matter of blood flow, fruit servings, and not the inescapable wires of society. That a person could sincerely change their world around with sixty minutes of exercise a day and a list of sunrises. And I tried that, I always tried. If there was a remedy I would go for it, anything to take away the awfulness of it, anything to belittle the agony. But nothing worked for me. And there was something hilarious in it too, that they were telling me I was going through something, as if I were not crushingly aware of the awful despair and what it did to me, of the dented shell of a human it left in its tracks. And despite this knowing that I was going through something it bothered me that I was never, not once, asked what it was. There was no one pulling me into the empty conference room to say, I’m worried about you. Did someone pass away? Was there a break-up? Is there something you were diagnosed with? No one cared to ask, no one cared to name what the issue was, to give it presence. And I found I really wanted them to ask. I wanted them to know.* 

 

*It’s strange, the things you want to name.* 

 

*The things you want to say out loud.* 





**Type of feedback:** 

I'm looking for someone to read this manuscript and offer feedback on pacing, intrigue, and tone as well as how successfully it emulates a surrealist book. I have typed up a series of questions I would like you to answer after you finish this book (about 3 pages worth). 



**Content warnings:** 

Depression/suicidal ideation 

Psychological thriller elements 

Hospitalization 

Burning 



**Preferred Timeline:** 

One month would be ideal but I'm flexible if you could finish it by July 15th. 



**Books I liked that have influenced this novel:** I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Ian Reid (or anything Ian Reid), Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn, Wild by Cheryl Strayed, Grey Dog by Elliot Gish 



**Beta swap availability:** 

It would be great to work with a fellow psychological horror novelist! I am also open to literary fiction, philosophy, mysteries & thrillers, and possibly a different genre if you think we would be a great fit!

1kwckci,https://i.redd.it/suv7bnpcm83f1.jpeg,The way I prayed for this..,"This man literally treats me like Gold. 
Ive been single for some time (by choice) because I’ve been healing from past bs. Honestly, Im still healing. I didn’t and couldn’t give that shitty version of me to anyone cause I was barely showing up for myself let alone my kid. I honestly don’t think I’ll ever fully be healed. 
I’ll always have those intrusive thoughts, I’ll always be the over thinker- I’ll always question intentions. 
I guess I’ve just learned to control it.. maybe mask it? i don’t know.
But as a result  those traumas are unfortunately carried…. Daily…. Everywhere. 
And It’s tiring as fuck… 
I was slash am tired of not trusting people… and not letting my guard down or being able to… for whatever the reason… but i don’t know- things are changing questionmark?¿ - I think. 
I used to get irritated easily, and I’d kinda freak out at stupid shit when I was irritated (I’m far from perfect so, I do still get irritated- but I guess I’m more mindful while in that state of mind.) …. 
I just can’t stand people with no common sense or choose to behave stupidly and or poorly then laugh it off. 
Anyway, he’s kinda helped me see not everything needs to be so black and white. And that there are people out there who actually fucking listen, and not just to respond, but to genuinely learn about someone or something… people who actually genuinely care- people who genuinely love hard…. Truly Genuine people. 
We’re both the same ethnicity, we both have the same sense of humour, we both realize when we’re struggling through something so we genuinely help each other. We both listen to different types of music, are spontaneous, and adventurous… We like a lot of the same things but at the same time have so many opposing interests. We’ve talked future plans together. He’s hard working. He’s family oriented. He wants babies, and a family. Which I’m back and forth on but it’s only because I don’t wanna be 55 while my child is graduating high school… 
I’ve known this dude for years.. we kinda grew up together… messaged on Facebook since we were kids, and saw each other in passing seldomly. He tried years ago to meet up, and grab a bite- even coffee, he gave me the free reign to choose what we do, I always played hard to get or was busy.. and maybe it’s stupid but now, I feel like I robbed us of all those years. I even said that to him, I freakin apologized for it. Who knows where we’d be… what we’d be… this is all still pretty new, so maybe this post is a jinx… maybe I’ll look back at this one day with him and laugh.. but I am a strong believer in everything happening for a reason.. 
I’ve literally prayed for someone who I can grow and laugh with, learn with, someone who I can read the Bible with, and practice the Word of God with. Someone who sees vulnerability as a strength as opposed to a weakness. Someone who won’t walk away cause I cry a little too much.. someone who’s not so damn judgmental.. someone who’s easy to be around. And maybe I’d like someone who’s easy to look at too. 
This screenshot I chose to share is such a surface level conversation- but it’s the little things for me. He actually waited for my call, and we spoke for a bit- as soon as I could hear him fighting sleep I told him he should get some rest, he proceeds to ask if I can hang up once he’s asleep cause he misses me and it’s like I’m there cause he’s able to hear my voice as he falls asleep… I hate hanging up on this man, but I’d be an ass if I drained his battery and he didn’t have an alarm for work… 
I guess the point of this post is to remind people not to settle, and to continue to work on yourself and soon, that good shit will follow. 
I’ve had highs and lows while being single, but had I not taken that time- that ME time. I wouldn’t be this version of me, and I don’t think I’d be receptive to taking someones unsolicited advice, or I don’t think I’d be able to handle the constructive criticism when needed.. it’s bitter sweet, I feel like I’m the best Ive ever been mentally to pursue a relationship- but I also can’t help but question what if I did accept the advances my way 13 years ago… 


TL;DR It honestly is the little things; and NOW, I get what someone means when they say “if they want too, they will”. Be the best version of you possible, and don’t settle! ",3,1748313737.0,texts,1,0.6,False

1. Do you think this is a growing trend at your cafes and how are consumers receiving it?
2. What do you think are the best use-cases for canning? IMO the convenience is great as its easy to takeaway and I can choose to consume my coffee later (e.g., pop it in the fridge for the day)

1kwcgrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1kwcgrn/ive_been_dating_a_korean_girl_for_over_a_year_and/,I've been dating a korean girl for over a year and I don't think we're getting anywhere,"So for context I'm working overseas in south Korea and have been for almost 2 years now. We've been seeing each other since March last year but not the entire time but I'll get into that later. For privacy sake I won't delve into what her or my lines of work are or our names but we're both in our late 20s. Due to my line of work I'm very well off: rent a nice place to live, make a good wage, drive a nice car, ect. Also not sure how much it matters but we're both Christian but she's more of a actual Christian than me. (e.g she actually goes to church regularly) It is important to know she's the type to be celibate till marriage though which I've known and been ok with the entire time.

The timeline goes that last march we met on Tinder which might pop up as a red flag but here it seems to be the most mainstream dating app and isn't used mostly for hookups like it is in the US. Right out the gate I felt infatuated but I try to be as self aware as possible in my life so I knew even then that's that feeling was but it's never really gone away. We dated for months and in hindsight I think my feelings for her blinded me to the fact that we weren't getting anywhere but August is when we really hit the rocks. She had expressed to me that she didn't want to be pressured into anything so we took a very casual approach to everything while we were dating so I told her she had the steering wheel essentially and we could go at her pace. Things seemed like they were progressing albeit slowly. She started letting me pay for things or help her out with stuff which she didn't like before. Then I had to move out of the town we lived in and to Seoul for work. I rent a house in gangnam now which is basically a hour drive away from that town. That was basically the iceberg that sunk everything for the rest of the year. She expressed that it was too long distance and if I'm honest she had been putting up roadblocks before that like getting annoyed with me alot and spacing our dates further and further apart and even telling me she wanted me to wait to ask her to go official till I lost weight. (I guess I'll add that I'm decently tall but at the time I was pretty husky even for my height) Pretty much as soon as I finished moving in September she broke it off and we basically didn't talk to each other at all. 

During that time I dated a few other people but didn't get into a proper relationship until December when I dated girl who was graduating from her college in seoul. That relationship had the opposite problem where things went too quickly but I'll definitely take the blame on that. By February she had crossed a massive boundary for me that basically ruined any trust we had built at that point so I broke up with her mid February. 

Pretty soon after that happened I reached out to my ex again under the guise of asking for a favor. I had checked in with her on Christmas and new years so we had established we still cared about each other at least as friends even though we weren't dating anymore. It felt great to see her again and enjoy her company while we exchanged favor for a favor. She even apologized for how she had treated me before and right after that we did start dating again but for some reason things were going better than before. We were going on much better dates like going to theme parks and movies as opposed to before we basically just went out to eat and get coffee. She was actually initiating the dates which didn't happen before and at a surprising rate. It got the the point where she asked what days I had off and planned dates on almost all of them. She even asked me to go on a trip with her which she had declined before when offered back when we dated the first time. 

What really cemented the impression that this time was different was when on one of our dates she introduced me to her sibling and after we split off to be on our own she initiated physical contact for the first time. Before this point we had never touched in a intimate way. Never kissed, held hands or anything like that (Weird I know since we dated for 6 months before but remember that gave her control of our pace and she never gave me any hints before so I never tried anything).

Since that date though I feel like we're sliding back down to how we were before. We haven't had any meaningful physical contact since even while we were on the trip together. The dates are still better but now it feels awkward since they're obviously things couples would do but we're basically just going as friends again. She's even been questioning why I treat her the way I do like it's weird for me to be paying for everything and offering to drop her off or pick her up or give her anything. Basically any act of service or gift or attempts to just hold hands she rejects or questions like she used to when we first dated. The other day after spending all day together I said something she took offense to and she gave me the cold shoulder while I drove a hour to take her home. The next morning we cleared it up since it was a miscommunication but it bothers me that she basically assumed I intentionally would say something mean or rude to her unprovoked. It was basically like the first time we dated where she would get annoyed and upset with me over a small slip or miscommunication and not have any patience or give me the benefit of the doubt. 

Because I've dated americanized and local Koreans I know both the relationship and the woman aren't typical or standard but I don't know if I need to give up on it, if I should persevere and keeping going as things are or if I should buckle down and be more forward and lay out my expectations to her. Maybe I should have done something already but tbh I'm terrified I might be  ruining it if I try take the wheel back from her now. I don't think its a cultural difference since I got along fine with other korean women when we were broken up but I'm open to feedback and any advice at all is appreciated.

June 7th @ Nabulu Coffee (6 St Joseph St, Toronto, ON M4Y 1J7) from 3:00PM to 5:00PM.

  
Bring a book and be ready to read, listen and talk.

  
When you come in, say hi and get settled in (maybe get a coffee or tea since we're doing this at a coffee shop). Start reading your book. If you need to talk about something happening in your book, ask if anyone can pause to listen. Also, if you're in a place in your book that you can pause and listen to someone as they ramble, please do so. Maybe we'll discover new books to read, maybe we'll get entranced in delightful conversation - who knows. At the very least, we'll get some time to dive into our books (:

No experience is necessary as long as you are honest and affectionate. I am very attracted to all adult ages and nationalities and body shapes from thin to curvy. I would like to get to know each other to develop a good trusting friendship, hopefully followed by an incredible dynamic filled with fun times, and intense pleasures in a personal relationship with a strong emotional connection. You will find me to always be fair and respectful, as well as funny and adventurous.

A discreet recent picture of me is posted in my profile. Because of my public profession, I can’t post or send identifying pictures online, but we can introduce ourselves in a videochat conversation. Please be willing to videochat with me soon; let me know which videochat app(s) you prefer. I choose to be private with my pictures, my full name, my age, and address especially on websites, but when we meet I will always be fully transparent and I will always be honest with you.

We can start with a casual coffee date and if we like each other, we can talk about dating more and spending time together with the possibility of so much more. Let me know what kind of dynamic that you wish for, and we can adjust our situation to make it great for both of us. I'm open to short-term, friends, dating, and even maybe eventually long-term. I like outdoor activities such as hiking and bicycling and boating and tennis, and I would love an upbeat fun activities exercise partner. I also like staying at home and cooking dinner or watching a movie together. I would also like to explore new places and events with my girlfriend. I want a close and intimate and trusting bond with a nice girl who really cares about fitness and good health and helping others.

I'm 5'9"", 205 pound, athletic and muscular, but not perfect or ripped, and I'm not looking for flawless people but youthful girls who want to eat and live healthy, exercise and always make ourselves better together while having so much fun together. Let’s start getting to know one another.

I am into personal touch, as my love language with many hugs, gentle aftercare, kissing, PDAs, holding hands, and cuddling. I hope for intense intimacy and a strong positive emotional connection. I desire quality time together and many fun dates exploring and always getting to know ourselves better.

We held hands and my wife asked if I wanted to try a new boutique bakery for lunch. I told her I wasn’t into that crap and wanted a real meal. She instantly got pissed and said “I’m trying to be affectionate and you’re being an ass”. I desperately want affection from her because she never shows it toward me. I was annoyed that she wanted to hold hands too. I’m super confused as to why I was annoyed by it though. Someone must know this feeling. It’s like she’s neglected me for so long that the thing I thought I wanted is no longer what I want. Or maybe that I know this affection isn’t going to lead to the thing I need.

1kwc9w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kwc9w3/first_date_red_flags_need_opinions/,First date red flags? Need opinions!,"Hi everyone,

I went on a first date recently and I’m wondering if I’m overthinking some things. I’d love to get your thoughts, especially from a guy’s perspective!

⸻

Background:
We (both in our mid to late 30s) matched on a dating app. I initiated the hello and introduced myself. He took a couple of days to reply, after which he explained he was traveling. Since we lived near each other (as per the app), I suggested we meet up. He was busy and proposed Sunday or Monday, so we agreed on Monday.

The Conversation:
Me: “Let’s meet here unless you have another place in mind.”
Him: Suggests a place an hour away for me by train.
Me: “Is this near where you live? I thought we were close by.”
Him: “Yes, it’s near me.”
Me: “I don’t drive, so it’s far for me. How about we meet halfway?”
Him:” ok but you live near the train station so you can manage”
Me: “sorry but I’ll have to change two trains to get there. Let’s meet halfway.”
Him: “Okay.” Suggests a place halfway.

We decided to meet at 4 PM. Around 3 PM, I noticed the cafe he suggested would close at 4 PM due to Memorial Day. I texted him about it, and when he didn’t respond, I called him. He asked me to find another place nearby and text him the options, and that he would respond.

I gave him two options, and he didn’t respond. It was 3:30 pm and time was ticking. I texted him saying, “hey I’ll only leave from my place after you confirm our meeting place.” Finally, around 3:36 pm he said either was fine, so I picked one and headed out. He also confirmed that it would take him 20 mins to get there. I kept him updated on my location while in transit. I arrived at exactly 4 PM, but he wasn’t there. When I called him, he said he was “10 minutes away,” but I could hear his wardrobe door creaking in the background. He was still at home. I decided to leave if he did not show up by 4:30 pm. He eventually arrived around 4:25 PM.

The Date:
When he arrived, he apologized for the delay. I told him he could have just informed me to arrive a little later instead of keeping me waiting. He said “everything happened so fast, I could not update you.” Ok, like, whatever. Anyway, I tried to keep things positive and started a conversation about his coffee order. We chatted, and I asked him like how is it possible that a guy like him is still single ? (Semi flirting). He started talking about his past relationship and I was listening intently. And since he had brought it up., I asked him how long had he been in that relationship for? He became super cagey and wouldn’t give any details, then got defensive about discussing it on a first date—even though he had started the topic. He then asked why I was single and I was answering that question in all honestly and he just cut me off, concluding that it must be because I want someone like my father to take care of me. I found that pretty off-putting and told him that taking care of your partner is a basic expectation in any relationship. He doubled down on his theory, which made me even more uncomfortable.

When I asked about his job, he was vague and evasive, just saying he worked for a bank. When I pressed, he mumbled something about a “Swiss bank,” which felt weird and defensive.

The Walk:
After finishing our coffee, I suggested we take a walk. He said but there’s no good place to walk around here. So I asked him where his car was parked and he replied it was a few blocks away. I said ok let me walk you to your car. To which he responded “and then you’ll walk back to the station?”. He didn’t offer me a ride to the station (which would have taken a few mins by car) even though I walked him all the way to it. As we arrived closer to the place he parked his car, he said, let’s keep walking straight ahead. And then we circled back. While on the walk, he very directly checked me out (scanning my body up and down with his eyes and wasn’t even subtle about it) and started laughing. I was like what’s funny ? And he said “no I was just checking how fit you are.” (I was kinda shocked but played along) and said uh huh ? And did you think I’m fit? He said “I can’t tell, maybe it’s the dress you’re wearing which is making it difficult to tell.” At this point, he almost walked into oncoming traffic and then jokingly blamed me for not pulling him back, which felt really odd.

Finally, as we were approaching his car again, he said no let’s walk to the station and mansplained which direction my train would be, even though I clearly didn’t need the help.",1,1748312817.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn’t mention. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

I think we could be great friends if we give it a go.",1,1748312808.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

His EF in August was 20-25 and Dr wanted him to have an ICD implanted He had the Medtronic Cobalt ICD implanted in December. All was well since then. EF has improved dramatically to 50-55.  

He had an ablation in January for afib. It didn't last and was put on Tikosyn in February.  Everything has been good since.  On Saturday morning he woke up about 6:15AM. Got himself a cup of coffee and sat down with his laptop. He started to feel lightheaded and short of breath. All of a sudden BAM.  His first thought was that he was shot. He's never been shot but that is where his mind went in that split second. He actually looked up expecting to see someone with a gun!  When nobody was there, he realized what happened.

They tell you if it happens once and you feel ok, you do not have to go to the ER. I said nope, we're going.  They ran every test in the book. Two different echo's, labs, chest xray and more labs.  Everything was fine.  They were going to admit him for a stress test but after contacting his EP they discharged him.  EP thinks it was atrial flutter and wants to discuss another ablation.  

He's supposed to schedule an appt tomorrow to see the EP....these things always happen on a holiday weekend...and have no idea what questions we should be asking.  Would this be considered an inappropriate fire? From what I understand, the device should be able to distinguish between a atrial flutter and a life threatening arrhythmia.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. ",3,1748312787.0,PacemakerICD,1,1.0,False

# About me:

* Deep into wellness, personal growth, nature, and meaningful community.
* I love clean eating, cold plunges, beach sunsets, hikes, and good coffee.
* Looking to meet grounded, conscious people — maybe even my future partner.
* Budget: $4,500–$5,000/month.
* Work from home but would like to have near by cafe/coworking spaces.

# What I’m looking for in a neighborhood:

* Close to the beach or great hiking trails.
* Walkable/bikeable to cafes, healthy food spots, farmers markets, and a gym or recovery studio.
* A chill, welcoming vibe — somewhere soulful but not too sleepy.

Encinitas is high on my list, but I’m open to other ideas if they match the energy.

If you live in San Diego (or know the area well), where do you think someone like me should land?

I’m a science student so I live a very sedentary life style, but after moving out I have full control of my diet and have lost weight without working out. 

I’ve plateaued for the past 5 months, and I feel like my diet has way too much sugar so I’m looking for substitute suggestions. I don’t work out, but I walk a lot, and I would love to start working out but I’m very busy with school and it’s hard to find the time to start a routine. 

So far this is my diet: 

Breakfast: Oatmeal and a black coffee 

Snacks/ Lunch throughout the day: 2 pieces of fruit, muesli bar, snack pack of trail mix, snack pack of popcorn

Dinner: changes every week, but I prioritise vegetables and protein. Change portion sizes depending on how hungry I am at the end of the day.

Water: try for 1L per day 

Sometimes I’ll add in some crackers and cheese if I’m extra hungry. And sometimes I’ll buy a regular chai latte. 

My biggest issue is my snacks/lunch. I’m at school studying, and don’t like cold leftovers so I usually just bring snacks but with the fruit and snack packs, I feel like I’m filling up with sugar. What can I bring instead? 

I’d love to lose another 10kgs by the end of the year!

At the beginning, she was super excited, elated I would say. She was super hyper all the time I began to think she was manic.

She used my toothpaste, curling iron etc and eating my food. But we got along great I thought a friendship was forming. We laughed at everything, she confided in me, we gave each other advice.

But the last few weeks have been off. She’s been cold and I haven’t been able to figure out why. I put it down to her adjusting and maybe stress, internal struggles, mental health. She stopped telling me stuff, she stopped laughing so much. And is in her room or outside constantly.

She told me today that she doesn’t want me texting her so much, only if it’s needed because she’s not a texter more of a talker.

Keep in mind I’ve only texted her here and there to say things like “I made coffee for the morning” or “picking up bagels what kind do you want?”.

And goes onto say she is adjusting to the change of having a roommate and she needs more personal space. She doesn’t like the fact that the living room is just outside her bedroom and feels she would like me to be in my room while she’s in her room.

She says that she likes that we talk and cook together but for her that’s good. She is having a really hard time with privacy. For context, her bedroom has its own front door so she can come and go as she pleases and the apartment is a ground floor of a house very spacious!

Suffice to say, this was after the other day when she insisted I confirm to her dishwasher routine of only using the dishwasher no handwashing because the rack is in the way of the corner sink. If I want to hand wash dishes I need to take out the huge rack from under the sink now.

All in all, I feel extremely love bombed in a weird way. She’s seemed like this social butterfly getting drunk most nights and now she is barely around me. If this is what it’s like I dont want it.
