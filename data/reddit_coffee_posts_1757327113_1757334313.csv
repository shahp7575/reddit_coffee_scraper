1nbm87p,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/1nbm87p/am_i_responsible_for_my_flares_too_much_sugar/,Am I responsible for my flares? Too much sugar?,"In the last 7 or 8 months, my flares have gotten worse. I've had RA for 10 years and have had very few flares. 

This morning, when I was lying in bed, dreading getting up because I know how stiff I've been lately.   I started thinking about what has changed during that time. What's changed is that after 5 years of being an over-the-road truck driver, I got a new job last October as a waitress. I was miserable as a truck driver because I felt isolated and missed my homelife. Plus, I was team driving with my husband, with whom I have worked together since we were married 35 years ago. I needed space! As a truck driver, I would get a large coffee, add sugar, and drive. That was my one cup for the day. 

Now at home, I drink coffee, maybe 4 cups throughout the day, sometimes 5. BUT I have a lot of sugar. I'm embarrassed to say almost a quarter cup of sugar with each cup. So I started thinking that's really what's changed. I don't eat a lot of sweets. I eat mostly healthy, and a lot of the time, only 2 meals a day. My shifts at work typically are anywhere between 3 to 5 hours a day. I get home between lunch and dinner time so I'll snack on almonds or cucumbers...small things because I eat dinner around 6 pm.

 Has anyone cut back on table sugar and seen a difference? I had a cup this morning with sugar. I'm on my second cup, and I only put milk in it. I did a little research this morning, and research shows coffee on its own is not really bad for RA, but sugar is. Milk in moderation has anti-inflammatory agents. The research also said to try natural sugars in moderation, like Stevia, honey, or real maple syrup. I'd rather use milk and cut the sugar out completely for now. I want to see if that's the culprit.

Has anyone actually made dietary changes and felt the difference? I mean, ten years and mostly flare-free. Sugar is the only thing that has changed for me. Way too much.

CONGRATS ON THE WEDDING

First off this is kind of a weird move for me to post here since gf is the one who showed me this community, but I'm genuinely dumbfounded and lost on how to proceed with anything given what is to follow. I suppose in some sense it's an aita and seeking advice at the same time. 

In late 2021 I met gf online as at the time we were both experimenting with content creation, we had a lot of shared interests and vibed well, however we were on opposite sides (like look straight down level opposite) of the planet and she was trapped in an abusive marriage she'd been attempting to exit for a couple years. 

As time went on I came to be of the opinion that if her and her ""adopted"" daughter (his niece, unwell sister) didn't get out soon he'd snap and do them both in, abuse was pretty obvious and continuing to escalate.   
  
I'd been looking for a framework to get out of my birth country for a long time (she's from the same country but emigrated over a decade earlier) so we hatched a plan that I'd leverage most of (sigh, I know) my resources to buy a property in the same neighborhood as she was living in, which she could ""rent"" one of the buildings on to use to start a business and work her way out of the situation he'd had her trapped in while also providing a place for her to flee when he escalated and hang out etc. 

So around six months in to the situationship I flew 30 hours or so to the opposite side of the planet with pretty much no idea what I was doing to buy a house in a foreign country the first time I'd ever even left my country. I have a tendency to jump into the deep end, clearly. And, with some hickups here and there, it worked, we hung out, I rented an airbnb nearby while the paperwork went through on the house, he continued to escalate, she fled child in tow to my airbnb, and eventually I managed to take posession of the house, which I totally got scammed on but whatever it was legitimately like 20x cheaper than where I'm from (I'd never be able to own real estate in my wildest dreams where I was born) and we moved in and I fixed the place up. The stuff of movies yeah?

However, while all this was going on she lost her job which was meant to support things while everything shook out, I burned up all my savings, had friends liquidate most of my assets (I didn't have much but it went a lot further in the new area) and her ex in process started a bunch of fraudulent/illegal court cases to make things appear more serious than they were. So, having run out my visa extension and savings, I returned to \[insert birth country here\] to make money while she sorted things out on her end and got set up so I could return on a more long term visa. 

Only she didn't, it's now the tail end of 2025 and she still hasn't found a job, and she still hasn't sorted out her own visa (one of the ways he was controlling her). Really all she has managed to do is finalize a restraining order against him after wasting a ton of my money on the worst law firm imaginable (like actually criminal, there are proceedings against them now) after I repeatedly tried to help steer things in a more helpful direction. My feedback on this and many more subjects was pretty much unwelcome. I would send money for things like fixing a crack in the wall, fixing the security system (which she was constantly reminding me she felt unsafe because he had toyed with the idea of hiring a hit man for his previous ex) fixing the pool so the social workers would calm down etc, and none of it would ever get done. I know she had it hard trying to deal with everything herself, but she was getting 2.5-3x the average salary of someone local AND not paying rent/mortgage. 

Meanwhile I was being worked to death by one of the most exploitative companies to ever exist (who are also getting sued left and right) destroying my body and getting proper injured, despite my best efforts, to support her while trapped in a country that is rapidly trying to turn itself into national socialism the reduxening. It was supposed to be three months, not three years, granted that was optimistic.

So as things really started to come to a head in \[insert birth country here\] and the visa rules were about to change in \[insert prospective new home country here\] due to the issues globally we hatched a new plan. I'd have to return before the rules changed or it would be a lot harder to make my way back, we'd both apply for asylum as now there was clear cause for it, and that would allow us to do more traditional work to stay afloat. I landed 10 days ago. 

I'd had my concerns and my reservations, I would have left if it wasn't for the house at many points, while we'd still played games together and stayed in near daily contact we'd had a lot of rough patches. I didn't feel like she was taking things seriously, doing her fair share, or acting with the regard a well adjusted adult would, and I felt undervalued and taken advantage of. I'm not really sure how to word a lot of this but I just felt like things had not gone they way they should have all along, but still, I had to grain of salt because I wasn't there, and she was dealing with a system stacked against her with a traumatized child on a big property by herself. Though I did feel that if she had done what she was supposed to I would have been there to support her much sooner. The main thing was she was constantly having mental health issues, which is warranted and fair, but she refused to get proper help for any consistent period, despite making most of the gains she did in the few months she actually talked to a therapist. Anything I asked for or suggested was anathema, and I felt like I was the enemy. 

Soon comes the part where it goes from life sucks, things are hard, other people have it worse, maybe I'm being too harsh etc to true mind blownedness. 

After traveling for 46 hours--including being detained and sleeping all day on a dirty bench at immigrations because I had the audacity to request the officers adhere to their constitutional obligation to issue an asylum seekers transit permit in order for the proper authorities to evaluate the claim (they didn't, I entered on an exemption, legally)--she picked me up after struggling for an hour and a half to secure transport while I sat there getting eyed up clutching all my remaining worldly belongings and we went to the house, she asked me to sit down and talk to her before we went in.   
  
Sidebar--To be clear, the country I arrived to is a place I truly love, but it also deals with the legacy of interference from the country I've fled and it's allies. Things are hard, and while the people I truly believe to be made of more fair and honest stuff functioning within a system that's far more humanitarian, things here aren't a picnic either, just better than a place that's collapsing violently while making enemies of the entire planet. So it wasn't great that she left me standing there after having consistent updates the whole time holding everything I own while people were looking at me knowing they might go home hungry. 

So I sit down

She tells me things really got away from her while I was gone, she has her ""adopted"" daughter beg me not to leave them. I promised nothing and said clearly that I can't make a promise without knowing what it is I'm promising about, and that they were freaking me out. I'm kind of an a\*hole for that, the kid is seven, but why did gf even put me in that position when I was in such a compromised state. 

Mind you, the whole time she wouldn't shut up about her ex to the point where I pretty much said if you are going to talk about your ex don't talk to me at all, so I know his house is full of cat poop and dead animals and he was illegally taking child there against court orders and how he blamed her for it even after she'd been gone three years etc and all that has been corroborated

But she said this from the stance of the property I'd gotten to help her was spotless, so hey, even if she was messing up literally everything else at least she was sortof doing something right?

It was a crime scene.

Like those hoarder shows on tv, youtube, whatever? Yeah at or beyond that level.

Her parents had come to visit a year or so in so I know it hadn't been like that all along. 

There was poop, there was mold, there were bugs, the entire bottom floor is water damaged.

You could not see the floor.

There was rotting meat on the counter. 

She had been telling her parents the house was perfect and she was about to take a video for the social workers. 

Turns out the money was going to buying stuff, losing it in the hoard, and buying it again. There were hundreds of dollars of unopened groceries rotting and buried in all of it. 

I spent two days dealing with as much of it as possible, the kid would still be worse off if the government took her and the whole rest of the family rejected her already partly cause racism, partly cause unc (ex) is a full blown narcissistic psycho and rages out on anyone who tries to help cause he wants to hurt gf. So that was priority number one. I couldn't even physically get to the shower to clean myself for the first time in half the circumference of the planet until day three of cleaning. She helped a lot day one, admitted she was delusional which I don't even know how to begin to address that, I asked if she talked to anyone about it and she said her mom, so I talked to her mom secretly (this became a big issue later, she hadn't told her squat and then her dad got involved and they have a strained relationship) cause like what was I supposed to do, I'm one person, and clearly I was not who I needed to be and she was in way deeper than anyone knew and needed support and monitoring. 

Day two she still did a good amount but not as much and then she accidentally hurt herself, conveniently as always happens. The injury itself is real but this is a pattern that has played out all along. Since then she's pushed through the pain some and done some each day (we got stuff for it, I'm not a monster, I think, but this also isn't my horrific mess and I'm still the injured party here) but she makes promises she can't keep, as has been an issue the entire relationship, pretty much if she says she'll do something or I ask for something those are the two ways to guarantee it won't happen. 

So day three I asked her mom to talk to her. Her mom sent a supportive message being like yo wtf but hey I'm here for you and this has to get fixed. If they could her parents would be coming to help but it just isn't an option right now. So then gf was gonna leave and come back to clean, to which I said you aren't even getting it done without the travel. Many fights ensued over the following days, and I told her she's in no position to be getting indignant with me. I should have just turned around and left, maybe even pressed charges, not tried to save her AGAIN from losing the child she's been raising since birth. 

I suppose in posting this knowing if it makes it into a video she'll see it is asking for another big blow up. But I mean, you know like don't do the crime if you can't do the time and she's practically getting it swept under the rug for her, which I have moral issues with. 

Day 10 the microkitchen is still biohazard level unsafe, but other than that what can be fixed mostly is, though she still hasn't touched the room where she was keeping the dog (I've tried deep cleaning it twice and it's still gnarly, that's another part that is just destroying me morally) she refused to send me a picture of until it was gone, whole other issue I almost left over. She's having all kinds of attitude issues and mood swings despite how I've taken a major part of the burden off of her. We're vaguely getting along. I told her I don't see how I could possibly continue this relationship after witnessing child abuse, animal abuse, financial abuse, vandalism et all. She had a major freakout at that, I mean I'll admit I'm a very facts based blunt task oriented person but like in this instance, my charitability is being shown in my actions I don't have the energy to mince words. We do stuff together, she cooks, and makes coffee. Partly cause the kitchen isn't in a state yet where I can even figure out how to do it myself and frankly it just disgusts me to the point where I have trouble trying. I'm probably kind of a jerk on that front but sue me.   
  
She still hasn't gotten her asylum stuff to a point where she can legally look for avenues to support herself, I already wanted to sell this property and move into something smaller and more manageable closer to kids school, in her name instead of mine this time, before any of this transpired. 

Now I kind of want to just sell and leave, I haven't started the asylum process yet so I have the option. I might be denaturalized and sent to torture prison if I go back, but I'm also the complexion the new regime likes so I might squeak through, even though I have a record of battling their horrifically violent hateful bs. Also while I was traveling my step mom died twice and got resuscitated despite having a DNR and now my dad is dealing with that on his own, though honestly I probably wouldn't be able to help him much even if I was there. He was planning to move this way as well once my step mom passes, and if I don't start the asylum process it would be a lot easier to come back with him as his caretaker when the time comes. 

The kid adores me, but to be honest her behavior is pretty extreme too at this point, gf let her walk all over her while I was gone, and I'm not really prepared to do worst case scenario level parenting on top of trying to keep gf from falling apart and risking everything falling on me again. 

Word is they were about to give her full custody though so if she suddenly has to move that may jeopardize things. 

So yeah, I'm sure I left out an absolute ton but I'm at this point where I don't know whether to try to stay, either doing asylum alone which I don't really want to, trying to salvage this mess which I don't really want to, going back and ending up in prison for being a dissident which I don't really want to or if I squeak through probably getting nuked cause the country I'm from is truly awful on the world stage and antagonizing everyone on top of being irrational and run by racist misogynist drunks playing with the big red button--which I don't really want to. I honestly just hate my fellow countrypeople so I don't want to be there for that reason even if the rest is pure hysteria--it's not, because they're all about how to screw over the person next to you to get ahead, just going outside is a case study in antisocial behavior. 

So yeah that's my aita, seeking advice, vent, whatever it is. I've got a month or two to figure out my plan before the visa gets too short, meanwhile everything devolves by the day and if we don't figure something out we'll be going hungry soon. I'm going to talk to a real estate agent about selling as soon as I post this, I'll get less than I paid even with inflation probably, and I'll be underwater on the mortgage and who knows if they'll even let me take the money back out of the country but if I can get a clean break it would be worth it, even if I have to spend some time cleaning it up, like I played a stupid game and won a stupid prize I guess, even if my intentions were good.

32 years old. Female. 120lbs. 5’4”. Non smoker. Not pregnant. No meds other than vitamin and probiotics. No current or past medical issues, but I do suspect some hormonal bowel issues…


I have occasional stomach upset/discomfort. It usually aligns with my period or ovulation. The worst of it is just before ovulation or just before my period. I’ve always assumed it’s hormones. Usually manifests as unexplained diarrhea and stomach pain (ie, I didn’t eat terrible the day before, didn’t drink a ton of alcohol, etc). 

I’ve never really been concerned because it seems pretty consistent with the timing, but I guess I’m just anxious today. Tell me this doesn’t look like coffee ground stool, please! It is straight liquid on the way out, and I have some stomach discomfort but again this is normal for me around this time of the month. I don’t take any regular meds, just a multi vitamin and probiotic. 

When I wipe the color is dark brown, but no where close to black. It is hard to tell from pics but the consistency is like wet dust, not little hard pieces. I just looked at my used coffee grounds from this mornings coffee and they don’t resemble each other, yet I’m still worried. 

I’ve gone like 6 times since 5am, woke up feeling like this. So maybe I picked up a little bug. Otherwise fine! Just a crampy stomach and diarrhea. Period due in 4 days…so timing lines up ",1,1757334003.0,IBD,1,1.0,False

She is two years older than him, they belong to two different religions, they are polar opposite by personality. Met on the first day of work somewhere in the early 1990s, and over three decades later, I doubt they have willingly spent one day apart.

One day, we were having a drink, and he told me he wanted to marry her the day he saw her for the first time. After dating for two years, he proposed while they were sitting in the office canteen and having rajma chawal. He asked, ""We have free time this afternoon, do you want to get married?"", to which she replied, ""Okay, we can get married today, but Special Marriage Act needs one month notice for registration"". No frill, no fluff. They went with four friends, got married that afternoon.....and went back to work the very next day (LOL!!) 

They resumed work immediately because they were already living together and didn't understand the concept of a honeymoon; instead using that money to invest and buy the house where I was raised. Those primitive years set a beautiful foundation to build my life brick by brick. 

When my mum told my dad she was pregnant, he said, ""Great news, now I'll have one more friend!"" And I believe this story. That's how they treat me. I spent a lot of time in my childhood resenting them because, despite their wonderful traits, they were never serious about parenting. They were never around a whole lot due to their full-time jobs. In my adulthood, I can appreciate them more. They are smart. I'm talking about freakishly smart and ridiculously talented individuals.

It's not gone unnoticed that he has never cracked a wife joke. Never. When friends and relatives chat and crack jokes on ""women, eh?"" or ""wives, eh?"", I've noticed him fidget with his phone or look away. She has a tight friend circle where they whine and crib about their husbands allllllll theeeeeee timeeeee. Honestly, even as a joke, I have never heard her utter a bad thing about my father. Not once. 

They are friends, best friends! I have seen love between them, but I also see genuine fondness and respect. They extend that to me too. While I see peers getting pressured into marrying and producing babies quickly (we are all approaching 30), mine remind me often how crucial personal happiness is and they want me to be happy, irrespective of my personal definition of it. 

I genuinely love hanging out with them! For example, yesterday we were sipping on scotch while talking about Hemingway, solipsism, and the history of coffee in India. Three topics completely different from one another and each one of us had something to talk about them. In my drunk stupor, I realised how fortunate I am. I don't think discussions like these are common. Are they?

I see my friends' parents - most of them had arranged marriages, some of them had love marriages. With time, many of them have become wonderful companions. 

But my parents? I LOVE LOVE LOVE being in the same room as them just to experience their love. There's so much comfort, admiration, banter, random living room dances, smiley smiles. They are giddily happy. I think that's the difference - I see other couples content and at peace. My parents are two madhatters in passionate love, the kind sonnets are written for and about. Every other story pales in comparison and sets my expectations bar unrealistically high. Why settle for someone who doesn't look at you like you're magic? 

PS: He gifts her gladioli on her birthday. I know for a fact that roses are her favourite flowers. I suspect it's an inside joke because of the way she giggles on receiving them.

1nbm3nl,https://www.inforum.com/news/moorhead/moorheads-red-raven-coffee-shop-to-close-at-end-of-september,https://www.inforum.com/news/moorhead/moorheads-red-raven-coffee-shop-to-close-at-end-of-september,"MOORHEAD — A Moorhead coffee shop is closing, with co-operators citing a lack of resources and support from the shop’s legal owners.

In a post on social media on Friday, Sept. 5, The Red Raven announced the shop will be closing at the end of September.

“We found ourselves as the last two people of what had been an eight member team,” the post read. “This work is not sustainable with two people, especially when we are volunteering our time and effort, and we were not given the tools or the resources needed in order to sustain the shop long term.”

While the shop was billed as a co-op, with multiple employee-owners, it never operated that way, co-operator Margaret McKenzie-Ray told The Forum.

“When me and my co-operators signed on, we never anticipated being fully in charge of any of these things,” McKenzie-Ray said. “It was supposed to be, again, a collective of people all taking on responsibilities and helping each other.”

The shop is closing about a year and a half after it moved to Moorhead. The shop has historically been a hub for members of the LGBTQ+ community, artists and local activists.

The Red Raven Espresso Parlor first opened in 2005 on Roberts St. in Fargo. Five years later, it moved to 916 Main Ave. in Fargo. The business lost its lease at the Main Avenue location in 2022. It reopened in a strip mall off Main Avenue in Moorhead in February 2024.

After opening in Moorhead, the Red Raven also operated BLK Cat Studios two doors down in the same building, which was intended to be an artist space and music venue.

McKenzie-Ray came on as a volunteer in March 2024, and said she was told employees would eventually be paid. However, volunteers were never paid, McKenzie-Ray said.

The business opened without a working espresso machine, McKenzie-Ray said. The shop’s location did not attract regular foot traffic, while BLK Cat Studios was not set up for artists or shows, she added. Without revenue from the artist’s space, the business pays for additional space without generating revenue from it.

All of the money generated from the coffee shop went to paying the two leases, McKenzie-Ray said. Workers had to chip in to cover rent and utilities.

“You can’t simultaneously have what is supposed to be a free, pay-what-you-can, all-inclusive, no-one-turned-away-for-lack-of-funds space, and then be paying a commercial landlord,” McKenzie-Ray said.

LexX Francis, one of the people whose name is on the leases, said they stepped away from the business around two years ago due to safety concerns and not feeling like their voice was being heard or respected.

Francis was one of the owners in the Red Raven’s previous location and helped it move to Moorhead. They said they agree the way the shop has been run is not sustainable, equitable or safe for its workers.

“I’d say that there are many sides to each story, and I’m not trying to say ‘well, this happened to me, so it had to happen to you,’ but I was also never given resources,” Francis said.

Francis said the shop was less-than-inclusive because of the lack of transgender people and people of color involved in the collective. They said others with names on the leases stepped away from the business around the same time.

“I hope that this doesn’t deter people from wanting to organize and continuing to try to build in community, because we can ask ourselves to be better,” Francis said of the shop’s closing.

McKenzie-Ray said updates about the shop’s hours will be posted on the shop’s Instagram page, u/redravenep.

The coffee shop will host three last events before closing: Underdogs Doodle Club from 6-8 p.m. on Sept. 16, FM Craft Club from 5-8 p.m. on Sept. 19 and Sacred Chaos Political Collage DIY from 12-2 p.m. on Sept. 20.",4,1757333726.0,fargo,0,1.0,False
1nbm27a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nbm27a/aita_for_resigning_as_moh/,AITA for resigning as MoH?,"Hi Charlotte and fellow potatoes,

I am 27F wanted to ask for some advice for resigning my role as Maid of Honor. I feel like I have a lot of emotions tied to this, and I want to get insight on my approach. I will be changing some timelines and names to protect and respect the identity of the people involved. I am providing some context below:

I was introduced to the Bride two years ago in a party through some common friends. We had a great time , and we hit it off because I helped her in the bathroom when she got super drunk. Throughout 2023, our group had different hangouts, drinking sessions, Christmas parties, etc., but Bride and I never had a direct one-on-one hangout. Our interactions were always through a group setting.

On my birthday party, she surprised me with a gift by proposing to me and asking me to be her Maid of Honor. I was taken aback by this because a) I didn't know her very well and b) she was asking me in front of our group and I felt it would be wrong to reject her in front of everyone, so I said 'Yes' and that I would table the conversation for later when I could talk to her in private.

In 2024, life happened. I struggled with my work-life balance and I started to see how prioritizing my social calendar was affecting my work, so by May 2024 I made a list of resolutions to prioritize myself, career, family relationships, boyfriend, hobbies, then friends in that order so that I can straighten myself out. I'm happy to say that these efforts started to show because I got promoted to a new role in my job, and I started to see results in the gym. I also got to explore my hobbies a bit more like art and journaling, and my partner and I got to spend time with both our families a bit more this year. I am happy right now with the current state of our personal lives, and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

During this 7-month period, our friends would offer to hangout and drink, but my boyfriend and I were not really interested in partying anymore. We both started drinking at a young age because where we're from it's socially acceptable to start early, and I hate to admit we're at this stage in our lives where we need 36 hours just to recover from a night of drinking. Lately, we've been enjoying going to coffee shops, visiting stationary supply stores, and journaling which I know is the opposite of what they want to do but it's something my partner and I really enjoy. During those times they reached, we respectfully declined our friends' invites until there was an activity they invited us to that we can all take part in and enjoy.

Eventually, the Bride finally got engaged to her partner and we entered wedding planning this year (2025). I tried hanging out with the Bride alone on various occasions outside of the drinking scene to discuss the topic and basically clarify things like why I was chosen as MoH, to get to know her and what she wants and expects of me, and to basically confirm that I am the best choice for this role. I have never been MoH, but I don't need a degree to know how much commitment this was going to take, so if I was going to be MoH for someone that I barely knew then I had to be sure and ask all the questions. I wanted to meet her face to face because I am firm believer that sensitive topics can be misinterpreted in a text. Unfortunately, our schedules never aligned and we have only seen each other in group settings and it felt awkward to bring this up with people around us.

What makes the situation odd is that she got a second MoH around January 2025. She's a direct relative and the Bride asked me if it was okay and I did not know what to say other than 'Yes' because it's not my wedding and I don't really have say on who should be included in the bridal entourage. 

I talked to my boyfriend and my girl best friend of 20+ years about this, and they gave me two different advice. My best friend said that I might be her most reliable friend because I do know how to take care of people especially when it comes to planning, drinking hangouts, and just taking care of friends, so even if she may have other friends in her direct social circle, I may have impacted her in a way that I couldn't understand.

My boyfriend had a different opinion about the whole situation. He thinks that she's just using me because I am the responsible one of the group and that I should at least have a conversation with her about this to at least iron out the details and get some clarity on why I was her first choice and why there was a second MoH. Essentially, rip the bandaid off as early as now so I can get my answer.

I finally grew some courage to ask her to have a call today about discussing if I should continue being MoH, and she said that a call would trigger her anxiety. Again, I wanted to make sure we had a conversation where we can hear the tone of our voice because messages in this day and age get misinterpreted so easily, and I didn't want this conversation getting screenshot and sent to other people. I just wanted to keep the conversation between us and to make sure I communicate how I feel without the second opinion of others. We met in the middle ground and she's suggesting a voice message instead so she didn't have to get anxious about a call and I could still communicate my feelings through a voice message. So I basically sent her this:

* I apologized to her for stressing her out and for being a coward not to have this conversation earlier because we're 5 months away from her wedding.
* I asked her why I was chosen as MoH when she has spent more time with other female members of the group this year.
* I asked her if she still saw me as a friend because we haven't hung out one-on-one and ever since my partner and I shifted our social calendar and priorities in 2024 we have not really been involved with the group
* I asked her if there might be someone better to take this role and suggested some options.
* I told her that I am open to any questions and that ""resigning"" is not the right word for me to use and that ""rethinking"" my place as MoH because I want to work this out but I need to know where I stand in her life.

She hasn't answered me yet, but I guess I want to ask you all is did I do the right thing? The wait is making me a bit nervous, but I'm open to receiving other comments about this just in case anyone has been in a similar situation. Hope you can keep the comments respectful, please.",2,1757333607.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

My girlfriend and I, are taking a year out with the idea of backpacking SE Asia on our way over to Cairns in Australia. For reference, we are 24 (F) and 25 (M) from Ireland and have been saving for some time now.

We plan to arrive in February 2026 and Bangkok seems like the spot to start. Other than that, we are very open to suggestions/tips to help plan our route.

Our budget is probably around £1500 a month for 6 months (each) and some spots we would like to visit are Ha Giang Loop, Khao Sok National Park, Borneo, etc. Of course, there are 100s of areas to visit but these stick out to us. Although we are open to skipping anything to improve our overall travel experience. I would also like to include that we are very much coffee drinkers rather than alcohol drinkers so will hopefully save a few pennies here.

P.S If you want to include any extra tips such as vaccines, visa, overnight buses vs flights, overrated spots, shared hostel vs splitting a private room prices, couple vibe rather than party party, safety tips...

Thanks in advance,

Ciaran

First solo trip abroad. I chose Oslo. I went for a circular walk in the nearby countryside that went deep into the woods. The snow was knee-high most of the way, even though it was April. I was in jeans and trainers.

I had earmarked a place for lunch that was on the trail, having found it in my guidebook. When I got there, the restaurant was under deep snow and (looking back now from more than double the age I was then) was clearly not yet open for the year, nor had it been set foot in for many months. While walking around the building looking for a door or some kind of sign that it might be open, I suddenly dropped down in the snow to between chest and shoulder height. It turned out I had walked perpendicularly from ground level down onto an outside staircase that went to a basement, settling on a step. It took me, a fit and healthy 18-year-old male who did a lot of sports, about 15 minutes to climb out.

It was a light scare and it was gone from my immediate memory by the end of the day. I only remembered about it much later when I became a parent and was playing with my son in the woods. I now shudder to imagine if I had been slightly closer to the building and fallen deeper down into the staircase to cover my head.",3,1757333518.0,AskUK,4,0.8,False

For example both me and my husband have witnessed phone calls where is accusing her of cheating being a whore calls her a slut so on. Would punish her by not talking to her for days has made sure she has no friends at all all the classic signs of a narcissistic control freak even know I have brought up these concerns with her and the blatant red flags she is head over hills and love with him and refuses to acknowledge his behavior and constantly tells me the whole we talked about things we've worked it out. Even to all of this I would allow him to come into my home on occasions I allowed him to spend the night more than anything so I could keep an eye on him and make sure she was safe I'd been approached by many people about arguments that they would have out on the street many people approach my mother as well with the same concerns and there's just been rising escalation especially the last six months where my daughter has become moody aggressive defiant towards me and her dad at times violent but last month basically all came to a head and my husband suffered a severe heart attack what on by the stress and the tension and constant arguments in the house I had to call an ambulance and of the 45 minutes of them working on him outside my house they could finally move him to the hospital where he had a stent put in his heart now that he's out of hospital I am trying to keep things calm and stress be at home but my daughter was still playing up still with the aggression the attitude so last week me and my mother met up with them for a coffee and to discuss the situation the red flags and how we felt that the relationship was volatile and toxic as you can imagine this conversation didn't go down well there was a lot of shouting and crying from her he was quite cocky in his response and claiming that all the major arguments happen six plus months ago even though I bought up more recent arguments and he kind of bushed off as it wasn't concerning I then told both of them that I had to think about my mental health and my husband's health so they are both adults and if they want to be together I cannot stop them but if she wanted to continue living in my house and have me pay her way I cover her phone bill I pay for her nails to get done so on because she is unemployed them to would have to split up I know this was a big ask so this happened on the Wednesday I told her she had till Friday to decide her choices were leather at home you follow my rules and You two break up or you move out you can go live with him be with him my door will still be open to you if it's needed but I would not accept her back if she was still with him. 

After days of moping around sulking and being passive aggressive towards me Friday came along and I asked what was her decision and she told me well she had no else to live that she would stay home and agreed that them to break up I went over the rules that she's not to be messaging him or calling him that the relationship was done and it was time to start moving on looking for work and working on herself and that if I found out that she was lying or going behind my back to me up with him she will have her bags packed and be kicked out the house straight away no second chances nothing she agreed to these terms that lasted a whole of two days because last night she asked if she could go out for drive on her bike to get some fresh air and that she wanted to see the blood moon I again reminded her she was not to see him or contact him and that she had to be home by 1:00 a.m. about two hours later I called her to ask her a question and she wouldn't put her video camera on I noticed that her location and Snapchat was not up to date and I felt that she was being suspicious and sneaky so I asked my husband to drive to the location that she claimed she was and when he got there he saw her bike parts and her boyfriend's bike parts next to her which just confirmed to us that she had gone out to see him she then font hour refused to answer any my calls or replied to any messages then when she finally did she came home and she goes a while I suppose I'm kicked out the house I said to her well you did lie to me in one of the messages I asked you are you with him and you said no her response was a very cocky laughing in my face I didn't lie I just didn't admit everything to me that's lying so at 11:00 p.m. last night she was kicked out the house house key return to me and her phone chip that I paid for.

As the sun started setting, the sky turned into this insane mix of pink, purple, and orange, and I suddenly realized I had no idea where I was going to park for the night. That little panic kicked in because I didn’t want to end up at some noisy rest stop.

Then I noticed a dirt road cutting off the highway. Normally I’d overthink it, but this time I just went for it. The road was rough, full of potholes, and for a second I thought I’d made a mistake. But after about fifteen minutes, it opened up into this hidden stretch of beach. No cars, no houses, no signs telling me to leave just sand, driftwood, and the waves crashing.

I parked with the back doors facing the water, set up my stove, and made the simplest dinner pasta with a jar of sauce and some zucchini I’d picked up earlier. It honestly tasted like the best meal I’ve had in weeks just because of where I was. After eating, I sat in my van with the doors open, listening to the waves and watching the stars take over the sky. With no city lights, the view was unreal like the whole universe showed up just for me.

In the morning I made coffee and walked barefoot along the wet sand, watching the tide pull back. It hit me then how much this life is about chance. If I hadn’t trusted that little dirt road, I would’ve missed out on one of the most peaceful nights I’ve ever had.

1nblrcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1nblrcq/explore_if_the_sweetcrispy_coffee_table_delivers/,Explore if the Sweetcrispy Coffee Table Delivers Stylish Function,"The Sweetcrispy SW1021NERUBR Coffee Table has been a surprisingly practical addition to my living room setup. I was eager to test its features and style, given its promises of functionality and design versatility. From the modern aesthetic to the innovative lift-top mechanism, the product does offer quite a bit. However, there are also some hiccups worth mentioning.

**Ergonomic Lift-Top Functionality**  
One of the main highlights for me has been the lift-top feature. The tabletop rises smoothly to a height of 6.3 inches, making it ideal for both dining and working on a laptop. I’ve often used it for quick meals while binge-watching my favorite shows or for typing away on my laptop, and the ergonomics are spot on. The steel hinge mechanism feels steady and secure, and it doesn’t wobble or shift, even when under moderate weight (the lift mechanism supports up to 11 pounds). However, if you’re the type who tends to lean on the tabletop, it’s better to keep in mind that the weight limit is somewhat restrictive.  

**Smart Hidden Storage Space**  
Hidden storage is one of those features that really won me over. Inside the lift mechanism is a spacious compartment that fits blankets, books, and even some board games. As someone who hates clutter but loves snuggling under a throw blanket, this was a match made in heaven. Additionally, the two open shelves on the sides ensure smaller items like remote controls and snacks are organized but still easy to grab. It’s genuinely a great system for those of us who like everything to have its place, though it might feel a bit cramped if you’re hoping to store bulkier items.

[Check Sweetcrispy SW1021NERUBR price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b0dkf2mkch/)

**Style and Aesthetics**  
I’m really picky about furniture matching the vibe of my home, and this coffee table did not disappoint. The textured wood finish and tapered leg design give it a sleek, modern look without being overwhelming. What stood out is how easily it blends with multiple styles—it paired perfectly with both my industrial-style shelves and the slightly farmhouse-esque rug I have in the living room. The rectangular shape and brown color tone make it neutral enough to complement nearly any decor. However, while the finish is visually appealing, it does attract fingerprints and smudges, so regular cleaning is a must.

**Sturdy Build Quality**  
My first impression of its sturdiness wasn’t wrong; the solid wood construction paired with a thickened steel frame keeps the table stable. Even when my cat decided to hop up and do her signature stretch, nothing wobbled. The durability feels reliable for everyday use, although the weight limit of 200 pounds caps off how much you can safely load it with. While the surface is described as “stain-resistant,” I noticed liquids need to be wiped fairly quickly to avoid residue—definitely not something you’d want to test the limits on.

**Benefits**  
- Ergonomic lift-top design perfect for dining or working.  
- Impressive hidden storage and additional side shelving for essentials.  
- Stylish design works with various interior themes.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Weight limits restrict how much can be stored or leaned on, especially for the lift-top.  
- Smudges and fingerprints are fairly common, requiring regular maintenance.  
- Assembly, while easy, definitely benefits from having two sets of hands for quicker setup.

**Challengers**  
In terms of alternatives, I’ve checked out other lift-top coffee tables like the better-known options from IKEA or CB2. While both offer solid designs, they tend to sacrifice storage functionality for aesthetics. IKEA’s models, for instance, often lack the sturdy feel Sweetcrispy offers and use noticeably cheaper materials. The CB2 options, while sleeker, are priced considerably higher and rely more on trendy looks than practical features like side shelving. On the flip side, some competitors use hydraulic lift mechanisms instead of standard hinges, which can be smoother, though they come at a premium.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering the Sweetcrispy SW1021NERUBR coffee table for what it is, it sits firmly in the realm of smart spending. The combination of style, practicality, and extra storage gives it an edge over pricier rivals that may look better but lack functionality. That said, if you’re hoping for a hydraulically-assisted lift or a stain-proof surface, spending more on an upgraded brand might be worth it. Still, if you’re sticking to a tighter budget and want functional design, this coffee table delivers plenty of bang for the buck.

It hurts… a migraine beyond all words, hammering against the inside of her skull. No—no, it wasn’t a migraine. That was too merciful. This was jagged, hot, crawling, as if a spike of iron had been lodged directly into her brain. She tried to laugh, but it came only as a thought. *‘So this is it. Me and that bastard must’ve traded shots.’*

The darkness closed in. Heavy. Endless. Too familiar. She remembered this feeling all too well—the same suffocating black that swallowed her when the semi-truck plowed through her old life.

Back then she had wondered why it was so dark. Now she understood. It was because she wasn’t dead. Not yet. Some flicker, some thread, still tethered her here. A purgatory of thought. A coffin with no walls. Was this what a coma felt like? Awake, vulnerable, trapped in a body that would not move, a mind gnawing at itself?

Not that it mattered. She was fairly sure she would die soon. These were simply the last moments stretched cruelly, as if time itself wanted her to suffer in suspension before letting her pass again. She let out an invisible sigh—or thought she did. *Can one even sigh when all that remains is thought?*

*‘Where would I reincarnate this time…?’* she wondered. *‘Surely fate can find a place worse than this wretched tunnel of a world.’* She almost wanted to laugh again, but the sound died unborn. Optimism was all that kept her sane.

Velora didn’t move, couldn’t move. She only let her mind drift forward, imagining what was to come. Perhaps nothing. Perhaps oblivion. Yet in this place, in this quiet—there was peace. A peace she hadn’t felt in years. Not since the warm embrace of her parents—*his* parents, from the first life, the only ones who mattered. The parents who had loved him, not the faceless pair who had abandoned her at the steps of an orphanage in this world, left in the hands of nuns and silence.

Here, there was no pain. No orders. No blood. Just stillness. She wanted to savor it, wanted to stretch it endlessly, cling to it until her very being dissolved.

 . . .

“Chief, we’re losing her.”

The voice cut through the void. Harsh, metallic, muffled by a surgical mask. Her body jolted—no, not her body, but something deep in her awareness. She felt the scrape of latex against skin, the prying of fingers holding an eyelid open.

“Pupil response is sluggish,” the masked man muttered, urgency edging his tone. “Barely reactive.”

The peace cracked. Reality pressed in again, dragging her toward the light of pain.

“Hold on a minute, will ya? I’ve barely managed to catch a glimpse of that bullet.” The man across the table muttered, his voice steady but strained, words almost swallowed by the drone of the overhead lamp.

The surgical tweezers slid into the ragged wound, metal scraping faintly against bone. The room held its breath.

Then came the sound—first a wet *slush*, then a sharp, hollow *pop*.

In the harsh glare of the lightbulb, something small and terrible glimmered between the jaws of the instrument. Blood and brain-matter clung to its battered shape, copper warped and gouged, but unmistakable in its form.

The bullet.

It caught the glow as though mocking the effort it had taken to pry it free. For a moment, it looked less like a fragment of death and more like a cursed relic—an object forged not to kill but to remind, forever, of the fragile meat it tore through.

With a final exhale, the surgeon dropped it into a tray. The bullet struck metal with a clean *clink*, echoing unnaturally loud in the stillness, like a bell tolling judgment. And along with it the surgical tweezer.

“That’s that. There’s your precious Lieutenant alive—she got lucky.” The Chief Mortician said at last, peeling his gloves off with a wet snap. His eyes flicked across the dim room, settling on the silhouette leaning against the cement pillar. Arms crossed, face unreadable, swallowed by shadow.

The figure stepped forward. A Geist Trooper, unmistakable even in the half-light. His gear clung to him like a second skin, the faint smell of gun oil and stone dust trailing with him. The sniper’s veil draped over his shoulders, ragged and dirt-stained, but adorned with crosses—dozens of them—Christian charms scavenged from the bodies of fanatics he had killed. They dangled like grim trophies, swaying faintly with his stride.

He gave no words. Only a nod.

Then he stood over the surgical table, staring down at the pale, motionless form of Velora De Mori. Her chest rose shallowly beneath the stained linens, her lips parted in a ghost of a breath.

For a moment, the war seemed far away.

His hand rose, slow and deliberate, calloused fingers trembling only slightly before he rested them against her head. A gesture almost alien in its gentleness, the barest pressure against her matted hair, as though afraid she might shatter.

It was not quite a blessing, not quite a farewell. Something in between. Something fragile that could not survive in the tunnels above.

The Chief Mortician, silent now, looked away. The sound of blood dripping into a basin filled the room instead, the rhythm almost reverent.

Then he stopped. No further did his hand linger. He lifted it away, turned without a word, and walked into the shadows. Step by step, until he was gone—as if he had never stood there at all.

Only one trace remained. A single dog tag laid beside her temple, faintly cold against the fabric.

Etched into it was a name. ***Velora.***

...

She didn’t know how to feel. She didn’t even know if she could feel. Trapped inside her own mind, the stillness shattered first into irritation—an itch she couldn’t scratch. Then the itch sharpened into scraping, raw and jagged, as though invisible hands clawed away at her flesh. And then came pain.

Unbearable, blooming like fire behind her skull. Her instinct screamed to move, to clutch, to cry out—but her body refused. Paralyzed, she endured it in silence, her mind rattling against the cage of nerves that would not respond.

And then—light.

It seeped in slowly at first, a pale glimmer in the dark. Then brighter, swelling, flooding everything, until she could no longer resist.

Her eyelids fluttered open. She blinked. She could *feel*.

Breath rasped into her lungs, shallow but real. Cloth clung to her skin, a blanket heavy across her body, hospital garb rustling faintly. And the pain—still there, dull, throbbing—but this time, she could raise her hand. She pressed it against her bandaged head, trembling fingers proving to her that she existed.

With effort, Velora rose from the bed, propping herself upright. The world swam before her eyes, then steadied. Rows of hospital cots stretched into the distance, bodies lying under sheets, some stirring, others utterly still. The faint murmur of voices, the rustle of gauze, the metallic tang of antiseptic filled the air.

*‘Is this… a hospital?’* She thought, dazed. *‘How… I thought I was going to die. I actually… survived?’*

Her gaze wandered across the room, searching for meaning in the simple sight of beds and curtains, as though they might explain why she was still here.

“Oh hey, you’re finally awake.”

The voice broke through the haze. Velora turned stiffly to the side.

A Mortician sat there, pen scratching faintly over a notepad balanced on his knee. His mask was pulled down, his tone far too casual for the weight of the moment.

“I was diagnosing you while you were still asleep from your injury.” He said, matter-of-fact. “If you wanna know how you’re here… the guys from the 178th regiment found you on their way to fight the fanatics that attempted to mine through the maze.” He glanced up from his notes, studying her with a clinical detachment that almost passed for kindness.

“But anyway.” He added with the faintest curl of a smile. “Glad to see you’re okay.”

As she shifted into a slumped position, something slid loose and struck her blanket with a faint metallic tap.

She glanced down.

A dog tag. *Her* dog tag.

Velora’s breath caught. *‘Why’s… this here? I was sure I threw it away.’*

Her hand trembled as she picked it up, fingers closing around the cold metal. The etched letters mocked her with their permanence: *Velora De Mori.* The very name she had wanted erased.

The reason she discarded it came rushing back with a sickening clarity. She didn’t want to be remembered. Didn’t want her body carted back, identified, spoken of like some dutiful soldier who gave her life for glory. No—she wanted to vanish namelessly, a ghost without weight or trace. She hated this war, hated every jagged piece of it: the ceaseless fighting, the collapsing tunnels, the endless rows of corpses waiting to be buried. And most of all, she hated the way her friends died one by one, faces burned into memory that would never fade.

Her chest tightened. She clenched the tag harder, wishing she could crush the metal flat.

The Mortician, who had been watching her, finally spoke. “That dog tag was placed beside you by your superior.” His voice was calm. “It seems you lost it by chance and he returned it.”

Returned.

Velora stared at the tag, the weight of it sinking into her palm like a chain.

*‘Why?’*

She didn’t understand why this was returned.

Her arm moved before thought could catch it. She snatched the dog tag, fingers coiling tight around the chain, the edges biting into her palm. Her teeth ground together, and then—without warning—her hand snapped forward.

The tag flew.

It struck the cement wall with a metallic *clang* before skittering across the floor, its hollow echo filling the quiet ward. A few patients stirred faintly, though none dared look up.

Velora’s chest rose and fell in sharp breaths, her eyes locked on the tag lying abandoned in the shadows. She didn’t want it. Didn’t need it.

The Mortician followed the arc of her throw, gaze lingering a moment on the metal’s final resting place before calmly returning to her face. He said nothing, his expression unreadable, though his silence seemed heavier than words.

Then, with a slow and deliberate motion, he rose from his chair. His gloved hands brushed the front of his apron as if settling invisible dust.

And he bowed.

Not deeply, but with the barest bend of the shoulders—an acknowledgment, restrained yet pointed. Not of respect in the usual sense, but as if he had suddenly remembered who she was. Or rather, *what* she was.

A Geist.

Velora’s brow furrowed. The gesture was unnecessary, almost mocking in its restraint. Yet, there was no mistaking the tension in his stance, the quiet calculation behind his eyes.

She wasn’t just a patient. She was something else entirely, and he knew it.



**.**

**.**

**.**

  


She was starting to get dressed back into uniform, ignoring the Mortician’s repeated advice to remain in bed until her body had mended. Their words buzzed like gnats around her, full of careful instructions and warnings, things she didn’t want, didn’t *need* to hear. To give them an answer would only open the floodgates for more of their so-called expertise, more unwanted pity disguised as duty.

So she remained silent.

Her fingers moved methodically, buttoning her tunic with practiced efficiency despite the soreness gnawing at her ribs. Every small motion sent sparks of pain through her skull, a reminder that she was still alive when she perhaps shouldn’t have been. The hospital blanket slid from her shoulders, pooling at her feet, a discarded comfort she refused to cling to.

Finally, her hand closed around her helmet. She lifted it, turning it just enough for her eyes to trace the clean, unforgiving hole carved through the steel.

*‘The bullet went through the damn thing,’* She thought bitterly. *‘Can’t I at least be issued a Lancer helm? Those ones actually deflect bullets, tch.’*

She popped it on with a sharp motion, ignoring how the pressure made the wound at her temple throb. Then, reaching down, she retrieved her sniper’s veil. The fabric was still faintly stained, its threads carrying the acrid memory of smoke and dust. Sliding it over her head, she let its familiar weight settle across her shoulders.

Now she looked the part again. Not a patient. Not a wounded girl. A Geist.

And with that, Velora fastened the last strap as if sealing herself away from the sterile air of the ward, ready to walk back into a world that wanted her dead.

The click of her boots against the stone floor carried her forward, unhurried but unyielding. She passed through the rows of soldiers lining the halls—Soldats with rifles slung across their backs, Rooks braced in heavier armor, Morticians clutching their ledgers and surgical kits, Vanguards leaning on their shields, Jaegers with the restless poise of hunters.

One by one, they lowered their heads as she moved past, a quiet bow of respect that seemed more ritual than instinct. None dared to speak. The air was thick, not just with silence, but with the tension of something rarely seen—something remembered in whispers and old war stories.

From others, she felt eyes cling to her, wide and unblinking, heavy with a mix of awe and fear. Her presence was a reminder, uninvited, of the legends that stalked the darker corners of their history.

After all, when was the last time the Shock Troopers of the King’s had set foot on their front? And a Geist at that, known for their ruthlessness to the enemy.

They were meant to be shadows—rumors at the edge of nightmares, not figures of flesh and blood brushing past in the dim corridors of a garrison hospital. Velora could feel their gazes pierce through her veil, searching for the answer to whether she was truly one of them, or merely a ghost wearing their trappings.

But she gave them nothing. No glance, no word, no gesture. Only the sound of her steps, carrying her beyond them, as though the act of acknowledgment would anchor her to a humanity she had long since discarded.

As she finally slipped beyond their sight, leaving the mix of bowed heads and fearful stares behind her, Velora’s pace quickened. The sterile halls gave way to narrower, darker passages carved into the underbelly of the fortress—corridors marked not for the common soldiery, but for those who wore the veil.

The air here was different, colder, the echoes muted as though the walls themselves conspired to swallow every sound. This was where her kind belonged. Not in the open, not basking in reverence or dread, but buried deep, unseen, where silence was their only companion.

Her boots carried her unerringly toward the chambers of her detachment. The guards at the threshold, faceless beneath their hoods and veils, gave her no bow and no word—only a subtle shift of their weight, a silent recognition that one of their own had returned from the brink.

Inside, the room was dim, lit by the faint burn of lanterns set low to preserve shadow. Maps lay scattered across the table, marked with ink and thread, and the smell of gun oil hung heavy in the air.

Velora drew a steady breath, adjusted her sniper’s veil, and stepped forward.

It was her rightful duty to report in, to stand before her superior and deliver the truth they already suspected: that she had clawed her way back from the edge of death, that her body—broken, stitched, and weary—was still capable of service.

A Geist did not request leave. A Geist did not linger in recovery. A Geist endured where even most Shock Troopers wouldn’t.

Her hand rose, curled into a fist, and struck against the steel of the doorframe to announce herself.

“Lieutenant Velora De Mori.” She said, her voice steady despite the ache beneath it. “Reporting status—functional. Awaiting orders.” She saluted.

The chamber was quiet save for the rhythmic scrape of metal against cloth as her superior worked at his rifle. His back remained squarely to her, broad and immovable beneath the veil. Velora held her salute without wavering, every second an iron weight pressing into her shoulders.

One minute bled into the next. The oil’s sharp scent mingled with the faint musk of gunpowder residue, a smell so familiar it was nearly sacred to them.

Finally, he set the weapon down with deliberate care, the faintest click of metal against the table echoing in the dim room. He turned, his gaze finding her through the shadow of his veil.

For a moment, there was silence—just two Geists standing across from one another, the unspoken language of their order heavier than words.

Then, a single nod. Curt. Acknowledgment enough.

He turned back to his weapon, resuming his task as though nothing had interrupted it.

And for Velora, that was all she needed. No questions, no ceremony, no rebuke. Just recognition.

Her hand fell from its rigid salute. Without a word, she pivoted on her heel and left the chamber, her footsteps fading into the corridor until even the silence swallowed her whole again.

The fortress corridors swallowed her in their echo, boots striking the concrete floor with a rhythm that carried both urgency and fatigue. The walls, smooth and gray, hid the oppressive truth of the cave system just beyond—damp, dark, and stifling. Here, the air smelled faintly of disinfectant and gun oil instead of mildew and rot.

Velora darted through them at a pace most would call inhuman, her frame moving with a practiced grace that belonged to the Geists alone. Hit-and-run predators, shadows in human shape—speed was their creed. To be slow was to be dead, and so every Geist’s body had been honed for motion as much as violence.

At last, she reached the cafeteria. The smell struck her first: boiled meat, starch, the faint sting of cheap coffee. Her stomach growled so violently it nearly doubled her over. *‘I’ve been starving since I woke up. How long was I out, anyway? They never told me.’*

She entered, and the clamor of utensils and voices dimmed. Heads turned, eyes tracking her slight figure as she strode between the rows of battered tables. Soldiers paused mid-bite, their conversations halting. Velora caught fragments of whispers carried across the humid air.

“Geists… they’re bringing in child soldiers now?” “Look at him, he can’t be older than fifteen…” “Doesn’t matter. They say he came back from the dead.”

Her jaw tightened. She felt the weight of their gazes cling to her like wet cloth, heavy and suffocating. She did not dignify them with a glance. The tray line was ahead, and that was all that mattered. Food. Silence. An illusion of normalcy before she was cast back into the dark again.

Her eyes caught on an unfamiliar face among the mess of uniforms. A boy—no, a man in years but not in bearing—sat stiff-backed at one of the long iron tables. His posture gave him away instantly: too rigid, too self-conscious, the way new recruits always were.

*‘A private? Fresh from the stock, I assume. Didn’t think this place would be manned with more people.’*

The fortress she shared with the Geists was never meant to look crowded. It wasn’t a place where new blood was sent to find their footing. This post was undermanned by design, held only by those willing—or cursed enough—to stay behind. The upkeep, the watch rotations, the barest minimum of defense; that was what kept the place alive on paper.

And yet, the reason it still clung to relevance despite its hollow halls was geography.

It was here, at the edge of nowhere, where Asia leaned across the pacific oceans formerly to shake hands with Australia. Where the arteries of the Solace Coalition pumped trade north to the Philippines, New Guinea, and the continental supply lines. This fortress was the lock on the door, the eye on the horizon.

Or at least, it should have been.

But Europe burned hotter, louder. The high command had diverted their men westward, bleeding this place until only scraps were left to hold its walls. Even a fortress with teeth was useless if left to starve.

Velora moved deeper into the cafeteria, the whispers behind her giving way to silence again. The private was still staring—not at her, but at his tray, the spoon in his hand hovering, unmoving. She wondered if he had heard the same rumors. *‘Probably thinks I’m some ghost stuffed into a child’s body. Not that he’d be wrong.’*

The tin tray clattered softly as it was passed into her hands, the steam of boiled rations rising into her face. A few strips of meat, potatoes, something that passed for greens. It didn’t matter what it was; to her, it was fuel, not food.

Velora didn’t linger in line. She scurried off, boots tapping against the concrete floor, slipping past the weight of a dozen eyes that pretended not to follow her. She found a table pressed into the farthest corner, away from the chatter, the laughter, the pitying stares.

She sat, shoulders curling slightly forward, and slid the tray onto the cold surface. Silence enveloped her, blessed silence, and she let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.

Here, at last, she could think. Contemplate. Let the fog of half-remembered pain, the echoes of bullets and screams, wash into something less sharp. Here, no one’s voice intruded. Whether they were whispering about her or not didn’t matter anymore.

Her fork stirred idly at the food, but she wasn’t eating. Her mind slipped easily into the folds of daydream, a place untouched by the cavern walls or the fortress concrete. The line between memory and fantasy blurred—the warmth of a family dinner from a life gone by, the chatter of a television in the background, the safe monotony of it all. A home that no longer existed.

She closed her eyes, the sounds of the cafeteria dimming into a murmur. *‘If only I could stay like this. A shadow among shadows, unseen, unheard… forgotten.’*

Anneliese Claude's friend had claimed she saw Zacharias Shaw walking into a hotel with the other woman, the two of them acting far too close. 
Anneliese had simply laughed it off.
""That's got to be a mistake.""
Zacharias? Cheat on her? They had grown up side by side. Thirteen years of history, loyalty, and a bond so deep it felt unshakable.
Just last month, he had rented out the biggest digital screen in Oceaton for her birthday. His love declaration played on a loop for the entire city. That kind of devotion didn't just vanish.
Besides, they were trying to have a baby now.
She had just gotten her pre-pregnancy test results. Everything looked good. The second she saw the report, she headed straight to his office to share the good news.
She stepped out of the elevator that led straight to the top floor. But someone was already standing there, blocking her path.
""You can't be up here without an appointment!"" the girl snapped, her chin slightly lifted.
She wore a bright yellow dress. She looked young, sharp, and a little too confident. Her face seemed vaguely familiar.
She stood with both hands out, clearly trying to keep Anneliese from getting past.
""Coral, this is Ms. Claude. She's also Mr. Shaw's wife."" Jackie rushed over, his tone tight. ""Apologize.""
Coral looked stunned for a moment, then straightened her spine and said with a sugary tone, ""Good afternoon, Ms. Claude. I'm Coral Slenderidge. Mr. Shaw is sponsoring my studies.
""I'm lucky he let me intern here. I didn't get any message about a guest, so I followed procedure. I hope you understand.""
She sounded polite, but there was an edge in her voice. A quiet kind of challenge.
Anneliese didn't respond. Her eyes dropped to Coral's hands.
""Nice polish,"" she replied, flat and calm.
That dusty blue shimmer was the same shade she'd seen on Zacharias' pinky last night while they were cooking. She had asked about it. He said it was ink. 
She hadn't thought much of it then.
Now, Coral quickly tucked her hands behind her back. She turned her head slightly, but not fast enough.
Anneliese saw it.
A dark, deep mark was pressed into the skin behind her ear. A hickey. With faint bite marks around it.
She knew that spot. Zacharias always kissed her there.
He buried his face behind her ear when he couldn't hold back. His voice would get low, thick with want.
""Honey… when will you finally be ready? I want you so bad it hurts…""
Her body had been through so much. She had suffered serious damage years ago, and doctors told her getting pregnant would be nearly impossible.
Zacharias said he was allergic to condoms. They were always too busy, too tired. They had been married for two years, and still had never gone all the way.
Each time he went to cool off in the shower, she had felt torn—guilty, touched, and thankful.
So, when he asked for a baby, when he gently told her to quit her job and focus on her health, she agreed without hesitation.
For six months, she endured the endless checkups. But deep down, she had looked forward to it.
Tonight was supposed to be their real wedding night. She had even gone out and bought lingerie—something she would never normally wear.
But now she knew the truth. Zacharias hadn't been cherishing her. He had already gone to someone else for what she couldn't give.
Her friend's warning, her blind trust, everything hit her all at once like a brick to the chest.
She stood still as stone.
""Ms. Claude, Mr. Shaw is with Mr. White. You can go in,"" Jackie said softly as he pulled Coral aside.
Anneliese walked forward, her heels tapping steadily against the polished floor.
She reached the office door and pushed it open just enough to hear.
A man was speaking inside.
""Having a lookalike is fine, but keeping her so close is just asking for trouble. What if Anneliese finds out?""
It was Christopher White's voice.
Anneliese froze. Her fingers turned ice-cold against the doorknob. Zacharias' betrayal was real. And Christopher—her own brother—already knew.
Zacharias replied. His voice was low and calm, steady as always.
""Don't worry. Anne trusts me. She loves me. She's obedient. She won't leave. She's focused on getting pregnant. She won't notice a thing.""
Each word cut deeper than the last.
Christopher's voice returned. ""Let's not forget, Selina paid someone to hurt her. Anneliese got stabbed twice. Her uterus was nearly destroyed. Everyone in Oceaton knows she can't have kids.
""If you hadn't proposed, whisked her out of the country, and kept her happy, we wouldn't have had time to clean up after Selina.
""If Selina had gone to prison because of her, her life would've been over. You really went the extra mile for her.
""Selina's proud. She doesn't like competition. She's nothing like Anneliese. If she finds out you found a stand-in who looks just like her, she'll lose her mind.""
""It's just a fling. Selina's coming back soon. I'll get rid of the stand-in before then.""
""Alright. Just handle it right.""
Anneliese's hand trembled. Her legs felt weak. Her vision blurred as the pain crushed her chest.
It felt like her heart was being torn apart, like fingers were digging in, squeezing, ripping it into pieces. Her back curled from the weight of it. Her breath came short. Her knees nearly buckled under her.
She was the true daughter of the Whites, yet they didn't bring her home until she turned seventeen.
No matter how polite or thoughtful she was, no matter how hard she tried to please them, her parents and her older brothers always favored the fake—Selina White.
The only person who truly cared for her was Grandma.
When Anneliese turned eighteen, Grandma gave her the family's heirloom bracelet. Selina couldn't stand it. She cried and screamed nonstop until their parents gave her a fifty-million-dollar mansion just to calm her down.
Not long after that, Anneliese was heading home one night when a group of thugs cornered her.
They yanked her into a dark alley. She fought back with everything she had, but they stabbed her twice.
She lay there bleeding, her clothes soaked. When the attackers ran off, she crawled toward the street alone, dragging herself out of that alley for help.
She was rushed to the hospital, barely hanging on. The doctors almost had to take her uterus.
The story exploded online and on every news outlet.
""Did you hear? The real White daughter got gangbanged and lost her uterus!""
""She's useless now. Can’t have kids. She was already crude—now she's totally ruined. Who'd want her?""
""How many guys went at her? If I were her, I'd have jumped in a river by now.""
The mockery spread like wildfire. The shame never let up.
And through it all, Zacharias was the only one who stood by her side.
While the whole city tore her apart, he stepped forward and said he loved her.
Right after her eighteenth birthday, he got down on one knee and proposed in front of everyone.
He took her on a trip. He stayed close and helped her heal.
She had almost drowned as a child, and it was Zacharias who had jumped in to save her. After that, she stuck to him like a shadow.
She already had feelings for him, and after that, she gave him her heart completely. Even when her family disapproved, she stayed by his side. He had nothing, but she didn't care.
She worked with him through the hardest years—through the tiny basement they lived in, through all the sleepless nights. She didn't complain once. Two years later, they finally got married. Even after that, he stayed gentle. Their love stayed strong. They began planning for a baby.
Everything felt like a dream. Anneliese thought Zacharias was her light, her miracle, the beautiful answer to all the pain life had thrown her.
But then she saw the truth—Zacharias had always loved Selina.
That was why Coral's face had felt so familiar. She had that soft, fragile look Selina wore so well.
So, the love confession, the public proposal, the marriage—none of it was for Anneliese. It was all to shield Selina. To serve her. To protect her.
How noble of him.
And what did that make Anneliese?
A sacrifice for their love story? A stand-in for the girl they worshipped?
Should she thank them for wrapping her up in this pretty little lie?
A voice broke through from behind the door.
""Who's there?"" Zacharias spoke, his voice low and cold.
He pushed back from the desk and walked to the door, his eyes dark and sharp.
He flung the heavy doors open and looked around with a tense glare, but the hallway outside was empty.
His brow furrowed. Jackie came jogging down the corridor.
""Who just passed through here?"" Zacharias' voice was tight.
Jackie froze under his stare, unsure what had happened. 
He didn't dare lie. ""Mr. Shaw, the madam came by. She bumped into Coral. Looked like she got upset. You didn't see her?""
""Anneliese was here?"" Christopher stepped forward, his expression tightening.
Zacharias' jaw locked. A sudden unease shot through his chest. His tone turned cold.
""Check the security footage. Now.""

Chapter 2 Divorce And Goodbye

""What are you all standing around for?""
Her voice rang out from the terrace. Soft. Clear. Familiar.
Anneliese stepped through the glass doors with her phone in her hand.
Her eyes were calm. Her face gave nothing away.
Zacharias and Christopher exchanged a quick glance. Their shoulders relaxed. They knew how much Anneliese valued her family.
If she had heard what they said, she wouldn't be this quiet. She would have been sobbing, shouting, falling apart.
Zacharias smiled faintly and walked over to take her bag. ""It's nothing. Why didn't you come in right away?""
He looked sharp and effortlessly put-together, dressed in a dark gray bespoke suit that hugged his tall frame just right. His presence commanded attention, not because he tried, but because success had settled into his every move.
Clauderias Tech had skyrocketed in just a few years. Its value had passed ten billion, and Zacharias, not even twenty-seven, had already made a name for himself as one of the rising stars in Oceaton's tech scene.
There was something magnetic about him. That quiet confidence. That polished charm. He didn't need to chase anyone.
A little warmth, a soft smile, and most women folded easily.
Anneliese's hands were trembling. Her skin felt cold to the touch, but Zacharias didn't seem to notice at all when his hand brushed past hers.
What are you doing here, Anneliese? Why keep chasing something that's fake? Anneliese thought.
She forced a smile.
""I got a call. Thought I'd take it outside so I wouldn't interrupt you.""
Zacharias relaxed instantly.
Christopher, still stiff with impatience, didn't hold back
""If you're going to be a stay-at-home wife, then stay at home. Don't just show up here without notice. If you really have to come, book ahead. You're always careless. Your sister never acts like this.""
If it had been Selina, they would've welcomed her with open arms. No matter what she did, it was seen as thoughtful, graceful, perfect.
Anneliese kept her voice even. ""You're right.""
Christopher frowned. She used to talk back. She used to get defensive or do something dramatic just to prove she wasn't any less than Selina.
But now she didn't argue. She didn't say much at all.
That silence stung more than anything else. It made him feel like she didn't even see him.
He decided she was just being her usual pitiful self—dull and forgettable.
""You two haven't been home in a while,"" he added. ""Come back for dinner tomorrow. Mom and Dad need to talk to you both.""
Zacharias nodded. ""Alright. I'll bring Anne.""
Christopher turned and left without another glance.
Zacharias guided her into his office and closed the door behind them. He came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist.
""What's the occasion? Did my sweet wife miss me?"" he said with a soft laugh.
That familiar cedar scent clung to his skin. Anneliese pressed her hand lightly to his chest, her eyes falling on the bag he held.
Inside was the test result she'd picked up that morning. It showed she was finally healthy enough to try for a baby. But now, there was no point in bringing it up.
She leaned away without meaning to. Her body didn't lie.
Zacharias frowned slightly. ""What's going on with you?""
She lifted her head. Part of her wanted to slap him. She wanted to rip away the lies, to break the pretty mask he wore.
But violence wouldn't fix anything.
She needed to walk away, to leave the Whites behind, the truth about what Selina had done to her, and most of all, justice.
""Will I always be less than Selina?"" she asked.
Zacharias paused. So that was what she'd been holding in. He reached out and tapped her forehead. ""You don't need to compare yourself to her.""
The words sounded gentle, but they split down the middle. He might have meant that she was incomparable or that she didn't even come close.
Anneliese used to believe the first. Now, she knew better.
She saw clearly now. Zacharias was an expert at making emptiness sound sweet.
A knock echoed at the door. Coral stepped inside with two cups of coffee.
Anneliese moved away from Zacharias and sat on the couch.
Coral placed a cup on the table in front of her, then walked across the room and handed the second one to Zacharias.
""Here's your coffee, Mr. Shaw,"" she said softly.
As he reached for the cup, her fingers skimmed his palm. The gesture looked casual, but it wasn't. Her nails grazed lightly across his skin.
""Ms. Slenderidge, right?"" Anneliese said suddenly.
Coral froze. The room felt like it dropped in temperature. Zacharias' jaw tightened. His fingers gripped the coffee cup harder than before.
He looked at Anneliese, who gave him a slow, relaxed smile.
""I just want juice. The medicine I'm taking isn't great with caffeine. That's all. Why do you both look so nervous?""
Zacharias didn't hesitate. ""Go get her some juice.""
His voice was calm, but the warning behind it was clear. He didn't even need to raise his tone. The look in his eyes said enough.
Coral's face turned pale. She bit down on her lip and spoke quickly. ""I'm sorry, Madam. I'll bring you juice right away.""
She grabbed the coffee and rushed out, heels tapping across the marble floor as she disappeared through the door.
Anneliese watched her go, her eyes steady and unreadable. She didn't look away until Zacharias stepped into her line of sight and blocked it with his broad frame.
She gave a small smile. ""She can't even handle a simple drink order. Since when did you become so patient with interns?""
Zacharias' face relaxed.
A moment ago, he thought something was off. Now, hearing her talk like this, he decided she was just being petty. Just jealousy, nothing more.
He leaned over, one hand pressed against the couch's backrest. His voice turned playful.
""Getting jealous? She's a sponsored poor girl. She's still young and doesn't know any better. Why are you even bothered?""
Young? Anneliese thought.
Zacharias must have forgotten—Anneliese was only twenty-two herself. At eighteen, she was already standing beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.
Back then, Clauderias Tech was nothing more than a tiny team of fewer than ten people.
She started as his assistant, worked long hours, solved endless problems, and by the time she resigned, she was heading the PR department on her own.
She remembered one time when a client humiliated her during a pitch. She had run off to cry alone in a stairwell. Zacharias had found her and told her something without a flicker of sympathy.
""Anneliese, you chose to step into the real world early. That means you better get used to being hit hard. No one's going to coddle your mistakes or moods.""
She used to think he was pushing her to grow. She thought maybe he cared in his own way.
Now she knew the truth. He had always known how to be kind—he just never chose to be kind to her.
When Anneliese stepped outside the building, the strength drained from her all at once. Her knees buckled, and she sank onto a bench near the curb.
She dropped her head into her hands, breath caught in her throat.
Her calm began to fall apart. Bit by bit, the hurt and anger took over, sinking into her chest like cold steel. Her heart, already cracked, felt like it was caving in.
The sun slipped lower. Faded light scattered through the gray sky. A chill breeze swept through the street, carrying fine raindrops that clung to her skin.
Dry leaves drifted down and scattered across the road. Cars rolled over them, grinding them into the wet pavement. They looked like everything she had clung to—love, family, pride—all crushed and dirty.
She didn't know how long she sat there, shaking. Her body trembled until it began to still.
She lifted her head and pulled out her phone.
She didn't hesitate as she tapped a number and held the phone to her ear. The call connected after one ring, but no words came out of her mouth.
A calm voice came through the line. ""Anneliese? I'm here.""
That sound hit something deep in her. Familiar, but distant.
Her chest tightened. ""George, I'm sorry to bother you this late. I just wanted to ask... can I still join the Project eVTOL research lab?""
Her voice was barely more than a whisper. Her cheeks flushed with shame. She had no idea if she even deserved to ask.
She had entered Astoria University at fifteen as a gifted aeronautical student.
By junior year, she had already made breakthroughs in sensor-fusion algorithms. Her designs helped drones avoid obstacles with higher accuracy and stability.
She used that research for wildfire detection. The drone she designed became one of the most advanced search-and-rescue models of its time. Even the professors had been blown away.
They filed a patent for her. They offered her a fast track into grad school. The department head took her on as his final disciple. Her future had been bright, solid, and already unfolding.
She even launched Superbflight Aviation with her senior classmates, a startup focused on lightweight aerial cameras.
But four years ago, she gave all of that up for Zacharias. She walked away from school, from the lab, from everything.
Her professor hadn't forgotten her.
Two years ago, he flew to Oceaton himself and personally invited her to join the eVTOL project. She said no again.
Now, she regretted it. All of it.
She bit her lip until she tasted blood, but George's voice remained just as warm. ""Of course. I told you, if you ever wanted to come back, we'd be ready. When can you come? I'll book your flight. Would tomorrow be too soon?""
Anneliese felt a strange warmth bloom in her chest. ""What about Professor...""
""Oh, come on. You know how he is. Just show up. Give him a surprise. Once he sees you, he'll forget whatever grudge he's holding. And if he doesn't, cook him dinner. If that doesn't work, cook him two.""
She laughed through her tears. ""I'll cook every day if I have to. I just need one month to sort out some things here. Is that okay?""
""Of course it is. We'll wait.""
""Thank you. Really.""
She ended the call and sat in silence. The weight pressing down on her chest finally lifted.
One month. She would get a divorce. She would leave this city. She would return to the life that was hers all along.
She looked up, her vision clear.
At that moment, a black Bentley passed by on the road.
The back window was cracked open. Inside, a young girl was straddling a man's lap. Her arms wrapped around him, and their kiss burned through the cold, as if autumn had nothing to do with them at all.

Chapter 3 Don't Even Think About It

If he had just turned his head, even for a second, he would've seen her—his wife, sitting alone at the edge of the sidewalk, drenched in the rain, shaking from the cold, her eyes completely empty.
However, he didn't.
He was too lost in the thrill. That young girl in his arms lit him up with something new. In that moment, he forgot he had a home, a wife, or a past.
Anneliese watched the car fade into the city's neon blur. Then, she stood.
She reached into her purse, pulled out the fertility report, and tore it apart piece by piece. Her fingers moved slow and steady. When she was done, she walked to a nearby trash bin and dropped the shreds in.
Then, she turned and walked the other way.
The night had deepened, and the misty rain still fell.
Even the busy business district had gone quiet.
At the corner, an old lady squatted on the curb. Her white hair clung to her skin under the streetlight, and rain misted across her thin coat. A few bunches of flowers rested by her feet.
Life was hard. Love meant nothing.
Anneliese slipped off her wedding ring. She stepped toward the old lady and gently took her hand. She placed the ring into her palm and folded her fingers over it.
""It's raining. You should go home.""
The old lady said nothing. Anneliese didn't wait for a reply. She turned and walked away.
Two minutes later, a black Phantom pulled up to the curb. The driver's door opened, and a man stepped out.
His leather shoes tapped the pavement, polished and narrow, catching the streetlight as he moved. His suit pants lifted slightly as he stepped forward, revealing dark socks and sharp, lean ankles.
He stood tall. His frame filled the sidewalk as he opened a black umbrella and walked straight to the old lady.
He reached down and steadied her as she tried to rise. Her voice wavered. ""Don't be upset, Jonathan. I didn't expect the rain. I'm still healthy. A little water doesn't bother me.""
She explained that she had left a concert. On the way back, her driver had accidentally knocked down a flower seller. He took the girl to the hospital, so she waited here since the company building was nearby. She figured her grandson, the workaholic, could come get her.
However, when she saw the chill in his eyes, her words slowed.
Suddenly, she remembered the ring. She fumbled to push it into his hand.
""A young woman gave this to me by mistake. She walked away before I could say anything. Quick, go after her! She went that way!""
She pointed toward the street.
Jonathan Fullbuster—the old lady's grandson—looked where she indicated and spotted a faint silhouette. A slim figure walked into the lights and fog, her form fading with each step.
""Get in the car.""
He helped his grandmother into the back seat. He turned up the heat, spread out a blanket, and waited until she was settled. Then he shut the door and took off after the girl.
His stride was steady, long, and determined. The figure ahead became clearer.
She walked at a calm pace, straight into the rain. Her mist-blue coat clung to her back, soaked clean through. Her waist looked small, almost fragile. She held herself upright. Her whole presence felt distant, as if nothing in this noisy world could touch her.
She turned the corner and disappeared into the night.
By the time Jonathan caught up, she was gone.
The long street stretched ahead, still and empty. Light reflected in the puddles, casting blurred shapes across the sidewalk. It felt like she had never been there at all.
Back in the car, the old lady leaned toward him. ""Well?""
""I didn't catch her.""
She scowled. ""You run an airline and pilot your own planes, and you couldn't catch one girl?""
""Grandma, your logic is a little off.""
""Don't get smart with me. I'm disappointed. That girl was beautiful and kind! Why didn't you show up five minutes earlier? You might've met her! You have no idea how perfect you two would be together!""
""She's married,"" he replied, holding up the ring. It looked like a wedding band.
The old lady didn't take it. She shoved it back toward him. ""So what? She took it off, didn't she? That means something. You'd better go find her and give it back.""
Jonathan turned the ring between his fingers.
The soft pink diamond caught the dim light and glimmered like a secret.
It feels weird… holding a stranger's wedding ring.
His grandmother stared him down.
He gave in and tossed the ring onto the center console and let out a quiet sigh.
A faint smile tugged at the edge of his lips. His sharp profile looked softer in the dark. ""Well, I appreciate your faith in me.""
""I don't care. That ring's worth at least a million. You're going to find that girl and return it. Got it?""
""Got it, Your Majesty.""
He answered without conviction, but his eyes still flicked to the ring. What a headache, he thought.
Anneliese didn't check her phone until she was in the back of the cab. Only then did she see the message Zacharias had sent two hours ago.
""Honey, something came up. Not coming home tonight. Sleep early.""
She didn't reply. She swiped away the pinned chat. Then she deleted the contact name ""Hubby"" and changed it to something else.
The bedroom looked like it had been staged for a photo shoot.
Roses covered the floor, their petals trailing from the doorway to the bed in a winding path of red.
Anneliese had dressed the bed in her favorite silk set, a soft shade of yellow that reminded her of buttercups in early spring.
She had gone all in. Every corner felt warm and full of promise.
But now, it felt like a cruel joke.
She stormed in and ripped the sheets off in one hard pull. Petals scattered across the floor, tumbling in every direction like confetti after a failed celebration.
The next morning, the doorbell kept ringing. The sound clawed at her skull. Her head throbbed, her temples pounding in sync with every buzz.
She forced herself downstairs and opened the door.
Jessica Sweeting stood there with fury all over her face. Before Anneliese could say a word, Jessica pulled her into a tight hug and started shouting.
""That j*rk! *sshole! He can forget about becoming the richest man now!
""He's got another woman in his heart, treats you like a stand-in, and still manages to fool everyone into thinking he's such a good guy. D*mn. That's some next-level manipulation.
""What storm drain did he crawl out of? Who let him loose to wreck people's lives?
""I swear, I hope he lives long enough to regret everything. May he stay infertile forever, and still have grandkids he doesn't deserve!""
Jessica's mouth didn't stop. Each curse came harder than the last.
Anneliese pulled her inside, guided her to the couch, and poured her a glass of water.
Jessica downed it in one long gulp. When she looked at Anneliese again, she noticed the dark circles under her eyes and the tired slump in her shoulders. She stopped yelling and dug through her bag for a stack of photos.
""Annie…""
""I'm fine. Just show me what you've got.""
Anneliese gave her a weak smile and took the pictures. She had tried to prepare herself. But the moment her eyes landed on the photos, her chest went tight.
Zacharias had Coral tucked away in a private villa just a few streets from his company.
They walked around together like a couple on vacation, bold and casual, with their hands locked like they had nothing to hide.
In one photo, taken just before dusk, Coral had her legs wrapped around his waist as he carried her into the villa. Her body pressed close. Her expression smug.
On her private social account, Coral showed off designer bags—bags identical to the ones Zacharias had given Anneliese.
In her latest post, Coral wore a diamond bracelet. Her fingers rested on a man's chest, her caption written like a claim—'His love is in the diamond. His heart is under my hand.'
Anneliese clenched the photo. Her knuckles went pale, and her eyes burned.
It wasn't about missing him. It wasn't even about heartbreak anymore.
It was about everything she had poured into a man who gave her back nothing but lies.
Jessica snatched the photos from her hand and hissed under her breath.
""Thank God you never slept with him. Or you'd be at the doctor by now. And even if everything came back clean, you'd still be sick just thinking about it.""
Anneliese gave a tired laugh. ""Yeah. Lucky me, right?""
She stood up and headed upstairs. A few minutes later, she returned with two big bags and dropped them at Jessica's feet.
""Help me sell all of it. And use the money to support some girls who actually need it. Someone who deserves a shot.""
The bags were full of expensive gifts—watches, perfumes, purses, and jewelry. Things Zacharias had given her over the years.
But packing them made her realize something. None of it had ever meant anything. It was just money. Thoughtless, effortless spending.
She used to treasure those things. Now she couldn't stand to look at them.
Why keep them, just to risk running into Coral wearing the same purse?
Jessica and Anneliese had grown up together in the same group home.
Jessica now ran a small hustle with two friends—part-time detectives, fake girlfriends, side-job specialists.
They did everything from catching cheaters to reselling luxury bags.
Anything for a price.
Jessica pulled the bags closer and gave a sharp whistle.
""Don't worry. I'll flip this stuff and find a few broke, hot high school guys to mentor. Let Zacharias know women can do the same d*mn thing.""
Sponsoring wasn't just a man's game.
Anneliese smiled and shook her head.
""No need. Let the stuff go to someone who needs it. Not every girl down on her luck turns into Coral. And Zacharias? He's garbage. But I'm not crawling in after him.""
Jessica let out a deep sigh and cursed Zacharias again under her breath. A hundred silent ways.
He didn't deserve a woman like Anneliese. And once she was gone, he'd never find another.
""What's your plan now? That *sshole's company is blowing up. Guys like him, the ones who came from nothing, they care more about image than anything. He'll never let go of that 'perfect husband' mask. He's probably not gonna make divorce easy…""
Jessica didn't trust him. Not really. She had a bad feeling. Zacharias seemed obsessed, and part of her believed he hadn't let Anneliese go at all.
Anneliese stayed home that day. She boxed up everything she owned, labeling each item, organizing what she needed to take when the time came.
Her grandmother had left her a small apartment before she passed. Once the divorce went through, Anneliese planned to move in and start over.
By evening, Anneliese sat at her vanity, brushing her hair under the soft, warm lights. Her reflection looked steady, but her chest felt tight. Zacharias had come to pick her up for dinner at the Whites' estate.
He stepped behind her and rested his hands on her shoulders. His gaze met hers in the mirror.
""Someone looks beautiful,"" he said gently.
Her lashes trembled. She turned to face him and tilted her chin up
""Zacharias, do you really love me?""
He leaned closer and reached for her.
""Why are you asking me that? Is it because I've been working too much? Not spending enough time with you?"" His voice softened. ""Once I get a break, we'll make up for it. We'll do the wedding, the honeymoon. You always wanted to see Bragg, right?""
Anneliese leaned away just enough to keep out of his arms. Her voice stayed calm. ""No thanks. If you don't love me, we can get a divorce. I don't need the title of Mrs. Shaw.""
They had known each other for thirteen years. Even without love, there should have been some sense of care between them.
She wanted to give him a chance to be honest. She wanted to end things with dignity, but Zacharias' hand clamped around her jaw.
His brow creased, and his voice dropped low and cold.
""Divorce? Don't even think about it. Only death can break us apart!""
That word hit her like a hammer.
Her shoulders stiffened. Her face turned pale.

I have been diagnosed with BAM this year, and I recently discovered that not only fat but also coffee triggers the gallbladder. Therefore, I wonder what’s the role of coffee in the context of BAM.

Discover how these sleek fixtures can dramatically improve your kitchen's functionality, aesthetics, and overall atmosphere, while reducing energy costs and maintenance headaches. Get ready to embark on a luminous journey that will forever change the way you perceive and interact with your kitchen space.



# The Brilliance of LED Downlights in Kitchen Design

# Understanding LED Downlight Technology

LED downlights represent a quantum leap in lighting technology. These compact, powerful fixtures utilize Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) to produce bright, focused illumination. Unlike traditional incandescent or fluorescent bulbs, LEDs convert a higher percentage of energy into light, resulting in superior efficiency and longevity. The average lifespan of an LED downlight ranges from 50,000 to 100,000 hours, significantly outperforming conventional lighting options.

One of the key advantages of LED downlights is their ability to produce a wide spectrum of color temperatures. From warm, cozy tones (2700K-3000K) that create an inviting atmosphere to cool, crisp hues (6000K-6500K) that enhance visibility for task-oriented areas, LED downlights offer unparalleled flexibility in kitchen lighting design. This versatility allows homeowners to customize their kitchen's ambiance to suit different times of day or specific activities.

# Benefits of LED Downlights for Kitchen Spaces

The adoption of [**LED downlights**](https://www.uskyled.com/products/dbfip65-waterproof-led-spot-light-5w-7w-9w-12w-15w-round-square-ceiling-recessed-spot-bathroom-spot-light-3000k-4000k-6000k) in kitchen environments brings a multitude of benefits. First and foremost, these fixtures provide exceptional energy efficiency. LED downlights consume up to 85% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs, translating to significant savings on electricity bills. This eco-friendly characteristic aligns perfectly with the growing trend of sustainable home design.

LED downlights also excel in terms of light quality and distribution. Their focused beam angle, typically around 24°, allows for precise illumination of specific areas without excessive light scatter. This characteristic is particularly beneficial in kitchens, where targeted lighting is essential for food preparation, cooking, and cleaning tasks. Moreover, high-quality LED downlights boast a Color Rendering Index (CRI) of over 90, ensuring that colors appear vibrant and true-to-life under their illumination.

From a design perspective, LED downlights offer a sleek, minimalist aesthetic that complements modern kitchen styles. Their compact size allows for seamless integration into various ceiling types, including dropped ceilings and soffits. The low-profile nature of these fixtures also maximizes headroom, contributing to a spacious feel in the kitchen.

# Strategic Placement: Maximizing LED Downlight Efficiency

# Mapping Your Kitchen's Lighting Needs

Effective LED downlight placement begins with a thorough analysis of your kitchen's layout and usage patterns. Start by identifying key work zones such as the countertop areas, sink, stove, and island. These high-activity spaces require focused, task-oriented lighting to ensure safety and efficiency during food preparation and cooking.

Next, consider ambient lighting needs. LED downlights can be strategically positioned to create an even wash of light across the entire kitchen, eliminating shadows and dark corners. This general illumination is crucial for navigation and overall visual comfort.

Don't overlook the importance of accent lighting. [**LED downlights**](https://www.uskyled.com/products/dbfip65-waterproof-led-spot-light-5w-7w-9w-12w-15w-round-square-ceiling-recessed-spot-bathroom-spot-light-3000k-4000k-6000k) can be used to highlight architectural features, display shelves, or artwork, adding depth and visual interest to your kitchen design. By creating a layered lighting scheme that incorporates task, ambient, and accent lighting, you can achieve a well-balanced and versatile kitchen environment.

# Optimal Spacing and Positioning Techniques

The key to effective LED downlight placement lies in achieving uniform illumination without creating harsh shadows or glare. As a general rule, downlights should be spaced at a distance equal to half the ceiling height. For instance, if your kitchen ceiling is 8 feet high, aim to space your downlights approximately 4 feet apart.

When positioning downlights near cabinets or walls, maintain a distance of about 2 feet to prevent unwanted shadows. In task areas such as countertops, position the lights slightly in front of the work surface rather than directly overhead to minimize shadowing.

For kitchen islands, a popular approach is to install a row of LED downlights along the length of the island. This not only provides ample task lighting but also creates a visually appealing focal point. Remember to consider the beam angle of your chosen LED downlights when determining placement, as this will affect the spread of light and the number of fixtures needed for optimal coverage.



# Customization and Control: Elevating Your Kitchen Lighting Experience

# Exploring Dimming and Color Temperature Options

One of the most compelling features of modern LED downlights is their customization potential. Dimmable LED downlights offer the flexibility to adjust light intensity according to time of day, task at hand, or desired ambiance. This feature not only enhances the versatility of your kitchen lighting but also contributes to energy savings by allowing you to use only the amount of light needed.

Color temperature adjustability is another game-changing aspect of LED downlight technology. Advanced fixtures allow users to shift between warm and cool color temperatures, typically ranging from 2700K to 6500K. This capability enables you to create different moods in your kitchen space. Warm tones can create a cozy, intimate atmosphere for evening meals, while cooler temperatures can enhance alertness and productivity during meal preparation.

Some high-end LED downlight systems even offer tunable white light, allowing for seamless transitions across the entire color temperature spectrum. This feature can be particularly beneficial in kitchens with limited natural light, as it enables you to mimic the natural progression of daylight throughout the day, supporting your circadian rhythm and overall well-being.

# Smart Integration for Ultimate Convenience

The integration of LED downlights with smart home systems represents the pinnacle of kitchen lighting control. Smart [**LED downlights**](https://www.uskyled.com/products/dbfip65-waterproof-led-spot-light-5w-7w-9w-12w-15w-round-square-ceiling-recessed-spot-bathroom-spot-light-3000k-4000k-6000k) can be controlled via smartphone apps, voice commands, or automated schedules, offering unprecedented convenience and customization.

Imagine walking into your kitchen and having your LED downlights automatically adjust to your preferred settings based on the time of day or your specific activity. Smart systems can also learn your habits over time, anticipating your lighting needs and making subtle adjustments to enhance your comfort and productivity.

Moreover, smart LED downlights can be synchronized with other smart home devices. For instance, they can be programmed to work in tandem with motion sensors, automatically illuminating specific areas as you move through the kitchen. Integration with smart speakers allows for voice-activated control, enabling hands-free operation when your hands are occupied with cooking tasks.

Some advanced systems even offer scene-setting capabilities, allowing you to create and save multiple lighting configurations for different occasions. Whether you're hosting a dinner party, engaging in late-night baking, or simply enjoying a quiet morning coffee, you can recall the perfect lighting scenario with a single tap or voice command.



# Conclusion

LED downlights have revolutionized kitchen lighting, offering a perfect blend of functionality, efficiency, and aesthetic appeal. By strategically incorporating these versatile fixtures into your kitchen design, you can create a space that is not only well-lit but also adaptable to your ever-changing needs. From enhancing task performance to setting the perfect mood for entertaining, LED downlights provide the flexibility and control needed to transform your kitchen into a truly personalized culinary haven.

As lighting technology continues to evolve, the potential for creating innovative and immersive kitchen environments grows exponentially.

Like check the habit more times than specified? I created a habit to do 4 pomodoros at minimum per day. But sometimes I do more, and that's the goal, to do more, depending if I am able to complete correctly the 4 pomodoros. Today I already made 5, but on my habit counter I can't put more than 4 since I decided it was 4 times a day.

To try another way on the app, I created a subgoal and put 4 pomodoros at the target. So at the end I can put more than 4. But on this format I have to click update, and type the number of pomodoros, instead of only clicking like a habit. The habit is more practical.

Another case. I drink a lot of coffee. I would like to track how many cups a day. I don't have a goal, I just want to track for now. Goals or habits?

Claims are better skin, fewer wrinkles, stronger nails, healthier joints… sounds almost too good to be true.

I get the theory — collagen is what gives skin elasticity and supports joints, and we make less of it as we age. But I also read that when you eat collagen, your body just breaks it down into amino acids like any other protein. So does it really rebuild collagen in the skin/joints, or is that just clever marketing?

Some studies do show small benefits for skin hydration and joint pain, but I’m not sure if that’s enough to justify the price. Haven’t tried it myself yet, but I’m curious because so many people swear by it.

I decided to run my own marathon, testing five services to see who actually delivers on their promises (and who just delivers buffering). Here’s my totally honest, slightly sleep-deprived ranking for anyone considering a new **iptv subscription 2025**.

* * *

### 1\. [**IPTVMEZZY**](https://iptvmeezzy.com/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (a bit less with a long-term plan)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (huge selection for US, UK, CA, and FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (even handled Canadian hockey and UK football nights with barely a hiccup)
    
*   **My experience:** I originally found this one via a UK-based **iptv reseller** forum. Setup was super straightforward, and the sheer variety of regional channels was impressive. My French movie cravings, UK comedy addiction, and US news habit were all covered. Only occasional buffering during a thunderstorm—otherwise, it’s been reliable.
    

* * *

### 2\. [**XXIPTV**](https://xxiptv.top/)

*   **Price:** $15/month
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (great US sports, UK reality, decent CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (sometimes lags during huge US sporting events)
    
*   **My experience:** XXIPTV’s [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) is actually useful (no payment info needed, which I loved). Their sports coverage is a highlight, especially for US and UK events. Some lesser-known Canadian channels did go missing for a weekend, but support was responsive. VOD is fast and well-organized.
    

* * *

### 3\. [**Aurorastreaming**](https://aurorastreaming.online/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (strong UK and FR, solid US/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (movies and news are great, but live sports sometimes need a refresh)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming was a wild card for me, but ended up being an out-of-nowhere winner, especially for French content. The EPG is easy to use, and I found a bunch of UK and FR niche stations I didn’t even know I wanted. It did struggle a bit during the UK’s big cup final, but otherwise solid.
    

* * *

### 4\. CityStream Pro

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 26,000+ live, 78,000+ VOD (mainly US/CA/UK, lighter on FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (mostly smooth, but peak hours can get sluggish)
    
*   **My experience:** CityStream Pro is the “steady but unflashy” pick. If you mostly watch North American or UK channels, you’ll be fine. The VOD catalog is a bit behind on new releases, but old sitcoms and classic movies are easy to find. Their **iptv subscription 2025** page was straightforward enough that even my non-techy friend managed to sign up.
    

* * *

### 5\. ViewSky IPTV

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 18,000+ live, 55,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK, limited CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening hours = more buffering, especially for UK sports)
    
*   **My experience:** ViewSky IPTV is definitely the budget choice. It’s fine for background TV or if you’re not super picky about having every single regional option. Their **iptv reseller** info is actually pretty transparent, in case you’re tempted to start your own side hustle.

My 2025 IPTV Lessons
--------------------

Here’s what I learned after weeks of bouncing between providers:

*   **Always take the** [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Streaming_Provider/wiki/index/)—what works on paper might not work on your devices or in your region.
    
*   Don’t chase the biggest channel numbers. Focus on the stuff you’ll actually watch (for me: UK quiz shows and FR crime dramas).
    
*   Even the most [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestredditIPTV/wiki/index/) brands drop the ball on big event nights, so have a backup.
    
*   If you become an **iptv reseller**, prepare for non-stop tech support calls from friends and family.
    
*   And always use a VPN. Trust me.",1,1757331845.0,Merittprotocol,0,1.0,False

1nblfqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1nblfqf/filter_coffee_recipe_using_aeropress/,Filter Coffee recipe using Aeropress,"I’ve been running some experiments lately and have created a few recipes. In this post, I’ll go through the recipe for my South Indian filter coffee. I’ll label the sections where you can customise the recipe based on things I’ve tried. If you find better ratios, please share them in the comments. I’d love your feedback.

**Coffee** \- Mysore Concerns (Mumbai) - Brindavan Bold / King's Roast

*This recipe works well with both, but I find the final flavour is better with King’s Roast.*

# Decoction Recipe

1. Bring 200ml water to a boil
2. **Aeropress** \- Use 2 filter papers and rinse them with a little warm water. Make sure there are no gaps where the coffee could spill through.
3. Add **50 g of coffee** to an **inverted AeroPress**. *(If you have a Prismo or any accessory that prevents percolation, feel free to use it and skip the inverted step.)*
4. Add **200 ml** of water at **95–100 °C**. Around the **180 ml** mark, you’ll notice the water reaches the lip of the AeroPress and bubbles vigorously as it slowly seeps into the coffee. Stir gently with a teaspoon in a back-and-forth motion to mix thoroughly. Add the remaining water until you reach **200 ml**.
5. Seal the AeroPress and gently expel some (not all) of the air in the chamber. Immediately flip the AeroPress onto a mug and rotate the setup in a circular motion to level the coffee bed.
   1. ***Tip****: A gentle pull on the plunger while rotating will minimise any coffee dripping into the mug.*
6. Repeat the circular motion at the 5 minute mark.
7. Press the plunger at the 10 minute mark.

# Coffee recipe - 

*I make 2 cups of coffee at a time, so the volumes here reflect that.*

* Decoction - 70ml
* Milk - 175ml (bring milk to a boil and pour into decoction)
* Sugar - Roughly 7g 

  
I prefer a **2.5:1 milk-to-decoction** ratio. A **2:1** gives a strong coffee flavour, while a **3:1** feels too diluted.

This has been my recipe for the past month or so. Please feel free to add modifications, comments, etc., that could improve it. Alternatively, if you have your own tweaks to “jazz it up,” please share. 🙂

1nblc9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1nblc9n/even_we_dont_talk_anymore_i_still_think_about_her/,Even we don’t talk anymore I still think about her everyday. What kind of connection is this ?,"When we first met, there wasn’t any instant spark or strong attraction on my side. But I had the sense that she might have liked me from the beginning. Over time, though, something shifted in me. I slowly started to like her, and little by little, I began noticing signs that made the connection feel special.

For example, whenever we went out together, there were these small, almost strange coincidences. One time, her coffee foam shaped itself into a smile, and we both noticed it at the same time and laughed about it. Moments like that kept happening — I would start seeing little things everywhere that reminded me of her. Sometimes, I’d even end up texting her right at 11:11 without realizing it, which felt like more than just chance.

There was one evening when we decided to go to a café. At the last minute, she suggested that we check out a different café instead. We sat down, and right behind her on the wall was a picture of my favorite artist. It felt like the universe kept placing these moments in front of me, as if trying to say something about the connection we had.

But despite all of these signs, things didn’t go smoothly. Eventually, because of miscommunication and because we agreed to “just be friends,” we stopped talking. Even after that, though, she still asked for my attention in subtle ways, and her behavior often felt mixed — like she wasn’t being fully clear with me. I didn’t like being pulled back and forth in that way, so I chose to distance myself.

Still, I can’t deny that the connection between us felt strong and real. Even now, I wonder what it all meant — whether those coincidences were pointing to something bigger, or if they were just fleeting moments I happened to notice because of how I felt about her.

1nblb82,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreComputers/comments/1nblb82/reveal_if_the_hp_elitebook_840_g5_laptop_still/,Reveal If the HP EliteBook 840 G5 Laptop Still Delivers Power,"The HP EliteBook 840 G5 has a certain charm that feels professional, minimalistic, and reliable. I’ve been testing this model for a good few weeks now, juggling various tasks like content creation, spreadsheets, video calls, and even a pinch of video editing. This is a refurbished product that aims to provide high-quality performance for those who don’t want to shell out the big bucks for a brand-new laptop. It’s clear from the first impression that this laptop was purpose-built for functionality, carrying the refined essence HP is known for. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
Carrying this laptop around feels effortless, thanks to its lightweight design at just 3 pounds. The silver finish gives it a modern and sleek appearance that fits right into a corporate meeting or while working at your local café. Its thin profile (0.71 inches) makes it easy to slide into a backpack or briefcase. Despite being a refurbished unit, the EliteBook 840 G5 came surprisingly close to looking new. There was hardly a scuff, and everything seemed well polished. What sets it apart is the robust construction I noticed; it doesn't feel flimsy. This might not be as flashy as some more ""luxurious"" ultrabooks, but it’s practical and straightforward. 

**Display Quality and Visual Performance**  
The 14-inch Full HD display runs at a resolution of 1920x1080, and honestly, it gets the job done. Is it mind-blowing? Not exactly. However, the anti-glare feature is hugely beneficial, especially if you work in well-lit environments or near windows. Watching videos or even editing images was adequate, though it’s obvious the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 isn’t aimed at high-end visuals. For office tasks or light streaming, everything ran smoothly without hiccups.  

[Check HP Elitebook 840 G5 price on Amazon.](https://mymypc.com/p/b08bjdl8xx/)  

**Performance and Day-to-Day Usability**  
With an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB DDR4 RAM, the EliteBook seriously delivers on multitasking capabilities. I’ve had several programs running simultaneously—browsers with a dozen tabs, Microsoft Excel, and some creative software—and it didn’t buckle under pressure. Boot times were quick thanks to the 512GB SSD, and the system felt responsive. However, I wouldn't dare throw heavy-duty gaming or 4K video rendering at this laptop since its integrated graphics wouldn't hold up. For regular professional use, such as data work, emails, and writing, this machine is solid. 

**Battery Life and Charging**  
Battery life is another area where this laptop shines. I easily got around 10-12 hours of usage with a mixed workload, while lighter tasks could stretch it closer to the claimed 14 hours. Charging was reasonably quick as well. It’s reassuring to know this refurbished unit doesn’t suffer battery degradation typical of older units. Whether in meetings or hopping between coffee shops, I wasn’t scrambling for a power outlet.

**Advantages**  
The laptop has some strengths worth highlighting:  
- Lightweight and portable design, making it easy to travel with.  
- Solid performance for everyday tasks, with its Intel Core i7 and 16GB of RAM backing it up.  
- Long-lasting battery life that can easily run throughout the workday.  
- Anti-glare display suitable for productivity in bright environments.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Every device comes with trade-offs, and this one’s no exception. Here are a few less favorable aspects:  
- Limited gaming or video editing capabilities due to its integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620.  
- The refurbished label might deter some buyers, even though this unit worked fine for me.  
- Lacks an optical drive, which some users might miss, although it’s largely an outdated feature.  

**Market Rivals**  
When comparing this laptop to alternatives like the Dell Latitude 7490 or Lenovo ThinkPad T480, there are both wins and losses. While the Dell Latitude offers comparable performance, its build feels bulkier in comparison. Meanwhile, the ThinkPad shines with a slightly better keyboard and security features but tends to cost more even in its refurbished state. What the EliteBook provides is great value with high portability and quality at a reasonable price point. The lack of a dedicated GPU doesn’t affect its position in the professional laptop market, as most competitors in its class have similar limitations.

**Bang for the Buck**  
This is where the HP EliteBook 840 G5 shows merit. As a refurbished model, you’re getting premium specifications like the Core i7 processor and 16GB RAM without burning a hole in your wallet. While prices fluctuate for renewed laptops, it’s safe to say this delivers serious cost-efficiency when compared to similarly specced brand-new notebooks. The upgrade to an SSD also ensures modern performance. If you’re hunting for a reliable and affordable workhorse, this option checks plenty of boxes.

we’ve had few exchanges where we’ve had a little laugh from small talk. she came into my jewellery shop a few times and i served her very recently. small talk is required in my job so all i did was ask her small talky questions while i packed her stuff but it didn’t feel genuine.

3. what if it works out. i do have a plan to take her to a new bowling alley that opened near me but what if it she says yes to me. i’m scared that i’d be wasting my time, money and effort with a girl who really wouldn’t be interested in dating. or what if she has a boyfriend.
4. my relationship experience. while i personally would consider myself a good looking guy, i wasn’t always like that. i had quite an ‘ugly phase’ during my late teens and early 20s. during that time i haven’t ever had a proper girlfriend, i’ve never done the deed or even kissed someone. i was literally just existing. while i’m alot better with small talk now, my inexperience with girls really comes out sometimes when things get spicy. what if she’s had experience with guys and then comes out with me, someone who’s never been on a date before and what she would think. this confident guy turns into a complete loser on a date who can’t hold a conversation or energy for a few hours

Yesterday started like every other doomscroll morning, but somehow, by midnight, I’d made $100 just *testing apps* on my phone. 

I’m still trying to figure out if I glitched the matrix or what.

So, before you roll your eyes, stick with me. Because this is wild.👇

---

### Here’s What Happened

- Saw some random comment mention **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.
- I’m skeptical—who actually gets paid real cash for staring at apps?
- But I’m broke, had nothing to lose, so I clicked.
- The sign-up was, no joke, like 2 minutes.

---

### What Was Different?

Honestly, half these “make money” gig sites want you to sell your *soul*.
But **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** handed out simple instructions after I picked an app.

Tap, scroll, give feedback, RATE STUFF.  
And get PAID to do it? Huh?!

---

- Each app took about 10-15 minutes.
- I thought “okay, I’ll do 3 and give up.”
- But I kept getting more notifications for available tests.
- By lunch, I’d made $40. By bedtime? OVER $100—no jokes, no codes, and no stressing over surveys that disqualify you.

---

I’m still hyped—legit almost skeptical it worked so smoothly.
The payout hit my PayPal today before my morning coffee.

Why isn’t everyone screaming about **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**?
Either this is the best-kept secret or I just unlocked the phone side hustle cheat code.

---

### Pros:
- No weird “submit your cousin's ID” crap
- Straight up mobile-friendly dashboard
- Real, tracked $$ (see it rack up live)

### Cons:
- A little too easy? I kept waiting for something sketchy… did not find it

---

Just to repeat, it’s **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** if you wanna try this.  
*No special skills required*—just your phone and a basic ability to rate whether an app icon is a “5” or a “meh”.

Has anyone else tried it?  
Are we all sleeping on this mobile money hack? 

Let me know if you jump in—I’m still confused (and kinda shocked tbh) but I swear, if next week I’m posting about how I funded my Friday night pizza binge with app money… you owe me leftovers.

--- 

Se- Literally experiencing the world. Looking at colors. Feeling the wind. Hearing people talking. Tasting coffee. The touch experience of sex. I imagine most people spend lots of time in this state.

Si- Remembering or imagining a sensory experience. Thinking about how it felt to eat grandma's cookies. Recalling the touch experience of previous sex.

---

Ti- Thinking by yourself, doing logic, thinking through problems. I also imagine people are spending lots of time in this state, especially if their job requires it.

Te- Thinking as part of a group, like a meeting. 

---

Fi- Your gut, momentary feeling about something. Happiness or sadness. 

Fe- Having 'gut feelings' that match people around you. When my kid cries, I might replicate their feeling.

---

Ni- Discovering a pattern in the world. Could be reading books and finding a similar line of thought. 

Ne- Feeling a 'vibe' towards something. A bunch of 'For Sale' signs might make you think the economy is not doing well.",2,1757330801.0,Jung,0,1.0,False

The week leading up to my period i get super insecure, emotional and unhappy with our relationship and any problem we've had becomes amplified. 

For context, we've been together for 4 years, don't live together and he's the most trustworthy partner ever - neither of us are cheating.

Things haven't been great the last few months as he's been away for 2 months, i've been stressed at work, and the sex has reduced to around once every 2 weeks because i don't feel romanced enough.

He feels insecure because we used to have sex all the time, but i've explained that when we met i was younger and was trying to people please, but with time and external stress i don't want to feel like sex is a chore and would like to be honest with myself about wanting it less.

I've brought up that perhaps if he planned dates and took the lead to organise things, this might increase the romance and lead to more sex - because for me foreplay start days in advance through acts of romance and feeling close through deep conversations.

He is trying in aspects like getting me some coffees and occasionally cooking, and i understand it's difficult for him to plan dates as he's unemployed and trying to budget, but i don't feel like those acts are what i call a grand romantic gesture as i also cook for him and get coffees.

As he's unemployed, it would also be nice for him to take the lead on planning as i already have so much mental load with working 10h days in the office, but when we talk about it he says that it goes both ways and i also haven't planned a date in ages.

However, I often suggest going to dinner, i last planned an activity BUT more importantly it's more romantic if HE were to plan it and at least ""kickstart"" the dates since i have felt a lack for a long time.

I've suggested one week he plans the date, the other i do.

But all my suggestions are met with unenthusiastic responses which puts me in my masculine energy. 

How do I keep up my sex drive if i feel undervalued?

1nbl2lk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbl2lk,How’s this as a Pantry instead of a walk-in? 1890s Cottage,"
Hi Team,

We have a tricky space as a kitchen as there’s a fireplace in the middle of one wall - which we have an oven& gas stove within- so our layout is restricted around this. We were trying to fit a table in the kitchen while also having ample space for prep (we cook & bake a lot!).

Room between the kitchen cabinets is 1.1m wide and between end of peninsula & cooktop about 1.2m so our walkways are good.

To the left of the fireplace(box shape in photos) is where we want our pantry. It’s 960mm wide & It’s only two of us in the house so I thought it’s best if it has a bench as a landing zone but also for using our small appliances such as rice cooker, air fryer and perhaps even coffee machine & grinder permanently there. Storage on top and in drawers for flour, sugar, tins etc etc.

The open design, as in not a walk-in pantry, in my opinion allows ample light and makes the awkward small space very usable and practical. Plus it will hide away all the clutter from view from living room and the main kitchen benches remain more empty & clean.

After some criticism about our design.

It’s not the most common and “instagram-worthy” we know, because it looks “busy” and because of that gap to the right of dishwasher.

We’re more interested in long term practicality.

1nbl26l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1nbl26l/should_you_trust_swisspers_pocket_tissues_for/,Should You Trust Swisspers Pocket Tissues for Everyday Use,"Swisspers Pocket Tissues, model T WB3V 0010 R19208 SWP, landed in my possession during a particularly disastrous allergy season. Imagine sneezing uncontrollably on a crowded train, fumbling through your bag, only to pull out a crumpled tissue shrapnel at best. Now picture the opposite because these little packs come off as lifesavers in pressure moments. As someone constantly on the go, from office commutes to spontaneous coffee runs, I'm sold on their convenience, but like any critical reviewer, I've got a mix of praise and constructive critique.

**Compact Design Fit for Practical Use**

The thing I appreciated immediately about these tissues is their compact packaging. With eight neatly wrapped packs, they fit everywhere from the narrowest purse pocket to my car’s dashboard compartment. Each pack is slim, yet once you open one, you’ll find a surprisingly hefty 10 tissues inside. They struck a sweet spot between portability and practicality. At 8.07 x 8.15 inches per tissue, they’re large enough for a single use without feeling overly flimsy. Traveling with them feels like having a silent buddy prepped for life’s messy interruptions.

[Check Swisspers T WB3V 0010 R19208 SWP price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0d6ztqg98/)

**Soft Yet Sturdy Performance**

The 3-ply construction is where you notice Swisspers setting itself apart. Softness? Check. These tissues are gentle on your skin, even after repeated use (hello, cold season!). Durability? They don't disintegrate at the first sign of moisture, which is a win when you’re tackling anything from spilled coffee to unexpected tears because Spotify shoved out that old breakup song in public. But durability aside, their diamond-embossed pattern helps with absorption, so you’d never need more than one tissue to get the job done. That efficiency matters when you’re hyper-aware about not running out before your next pit stop.

**Key Benefits**

- Compact packs are travel-friendly, fitting bags, pockets, and cars seamlessly.  
- Each tissue balances softness with strength for comfortable daily use.  
- 3-ply design ensures that one tissue can go the distance (seriously, no need to double up).  

**Caveats**

However, no product is quite the gold standard without a gap or two. Firstly, while the tissues themselves are substantial, there are times during heavy colds or allergies where the pack size feels limiting. Just 10 per pack means you need to stash extras if you're prone to marathon sneezing. Secondly, aesthetically, the packaging design could use a bit of chic flair—currently veering more practical than stylish. And lastly, disposing of used tissues from such compact packs in socially discreet ways feels tricky without additional plastic or accessories.

- Limited tissue count per pack can be restrictive for extended scenarios.  
- Packaging isn't compatible with an aesthetic-conscious audience.  
- Lack of biodegradable focus might sway environmentally inclined users.  

**Peer Products Worth a Look**

Major contenders in this category include Puffs To Go and Kleenex Slim Packs. Comparing them becomes necessary to highlight Swisspers’ standout features. Puffs is famously soft, but their tissue strength sometimes falls short in particularly messy situations. Kleenex, on the other hand, prioritizes stylish packaging but misses durability when tested against ongoing wear and tear. Swisspers strikes a balance; yes, they lack the glam factor, but their combination of compact utility and ability to handle life’s surprises puts them ahead functionally.

**Cost Efficiency Evaluation**

Value-driven users like myself value a product that not only serves the purpose but lasts longer alongside competitors without breaking any budgets. Swisspers Pocket Tissues confidently land in that territory. They’re priced such that each pack feels like a solid investment of convenience over repeated purchases involving lower-quality alternatives. While some might find the 10-per-pack limit unsatisfactory for the cost, their longevity during actual use absolutely compensates for it.

As the title says, I’m curious if people regularly communicate between dates. 

I went on what I thought was an amazing date on Saturday, our plans continued to extend from just coffee, to lunch, to hanging out all afternoon and then dinner. She numerous times expressed to me that she knew I would break her heart and I took that as a good sign that she was feeling as strongly about the date as I was.

Yesterday, we made tentative plans and she said she’d let me know. Around 11am she messaged me that she was going to the gym but would let me know, then I never heard back all day. So I sat around doing nothing because I was hopeful I’d hear from her.

Prior to that we basically texted non stop for a week. 

For context:

I’ve (40M) recently decided I’m ready to beginning dating again after a 15 year abusive relationship that I finally escaped six months ago. So I’m just not even sure what to expect anymore and really don’t know dating etiquette.",1,1757330520.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

1nbkzzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGearReviews/comments/1nbkzzl/why_is_the_best_graphics_drawing_tablet_gaomon/,Why Is the Best Graphics Drawing Tablet GAOMON S620 Worth It,"Testing out the GAOMON S620 graphic drawing tablet has been an adventure in rediscovering my love for sketching and creative projects. I’ve used a fair share of drawing tablets before, so I was naturally skeptical about what this model could offer compared to others. Right out of the box, its compact design struck me as ideal for someone like me who’s always shuffling between work-from-home sessions and meeting friends for coffee sketches. The GAOMON S620 is lightweight and portable, which makes it surprisingly easy to carry around in a laptop bag alongside other gear. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was its sturdy yet slim profile. Measuring 6.5x4 inches for the active drawing space, the GAOMON S620 strikes that sweet spot of being small enough to lug around but large enough to comfortably draw without feeling restricted. Four non-slip rubber pads on the underside keep it stable, even on slightly uneven desk surfaces. Having accidentally knocked it against the edge of my desk one too many times while enthusiastically swiping through Photoshop layers, I can vouch for its durability. About usability, both left-handed and right-handed users are accommodated, as you can simply rotate the device 180 degrees via the driver settings. This feature turned out to be a godsend for my left-handed coworker who occasionally borrows it!

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact and travel-friendly design  
- Sturdy and well-built for everyday usage  
- Supports left- and right-handed users seamlessly  

[Check GAOMON S620 price on Amazon.](https://batterydiscounter.com/p/b08g8tckwq/)  

**Performance and Drawing Experience**  
Once I started using it, the 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity made all the difference in the world. As someone who enjoys replicating natural brush strokes digitally, drawing felt intuitive and smooth with the battery-free passive pen. No need to charge the pen was a relief. Every pen nib swapped into it performed consistently, even after hours of switching between sketching in Krita and editing in Photoshop. The 5080 LPI resolution and 266 PPS report rate ensured the cursor's movement was precise. I ran it through detailed graphic designs and some light 2D animation, and its responsiveness didn’t falter once.

On the gaming side—yes, I put it to the test playing Osu! just to see—its speed and accuracy combined so well I ended up beating my old rhythm-game high score! Versatility is the GAOMON S620’s middle name, whether it’s being used for graphics design, annotating documents, or spending a chill afternoon painting digitally.

**Compatibility and Versatility**  
I was curious to see how far I could stretch its compatibility, so I hooked it up with a MacBook and a Windows laptop. It worked effortlessly on both machines, needing only basic driver installation. Impressively, it also pairs with Android devices—though the functionality depends on whether your device supports OTG. Converting my Samsung tablet into a portable design station was a lot easier than expected. Additionally, it integrates well with creative software like Adobe Illustrator, Corel Painter, Clip Studio Paint, and Krita, which I regularly switch between depending on project needs. Whether you’re annotating documents or working on 3D illustration, it’s a solid performer.

**Strengths**  
- Excellent pen sensitivity and responsiveness  
- Wide compatibility across operating systems and devices  
- Works great with various professional design software  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Lack of built-in wireless functionality might feel restrictive if you’re used to Bluetooth-enabled tablets.  
- Adapters included in the box are specifically for Android devices and don’t work with laptops, which might confuse first-time users.  
- The active drawing area might feel slightly cramped for advanced projects requiring more expansive strokes.  

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing this to the Wacom Intuos Small, it’s clear the GAOMON S620 offers many comparable features at a more budget-friendly price point. While Wacom’s driver system and ergonomic features might give it an edge for long-session designers, the GAOMON S620 excels by offering comparable sensitivity and versatility at a significantly lower cost. Meanwhile, XP-Pen’s Deco Mini 7 was another contender in my testing lineup. It stands out with wireless connectivity, though I found the GAOMON performed equally well in drawing quality despite missing that feature. 

For beginners or casual creators, the GAOMON S620 punches above its cost by offering professional-grade features like customizable express keys. It’s also more versatile for multimedia functions like annotating documents or gaming, where others focus solely on design work.

**Budget-Friendly**  
When weighing its features against products in the same price category, the value-proposition becomes apparent. Its range of capabilities, from graphic design to gaming to teaching applications, makes it a well-rounded piece of equipment for those on a budget. It doesn’t gouge your wallet yet lets you enjoy quality that would generally come with more expensive options. While it might not boast premium extras such as wireless support, these trade-offs hardly outweighed its merits for me personally. For anyone just starting in digital design or someone needing a second tablet for on-the-go tasks, its affordability hits the mark.

 A couple of things I’ve tried:

 

 Soft lo-fi playlists while I tidy up (makes chores feel way less like “work”)

 

 Jazz or acoustic in the evenings with the lights dimmed — it instantly slows everything down

 

 Ambient “rain + piano” tracks on a Sunday morning while brewing coffee

The math is simple. Coldbrew I make at 4:1 then dilute 1:1 so net is 8:1 ratio. Pourover I use 15:1. 

That means cold brew is using almost twice as many beans per serving, with the assumption that serving sizes are equivalent.

Am I missing something? Any techniques for stretching the cold brew to get closer to the pourover ratio in terms of efficiency?

*NioCorp’s Phase I drilling is now complete, with visual core inspection already indicating strong mineral continuity that reinforces the scale and quality of the Elk Creek resource. While assays and formal grade updates are still pending, CEO Mark Smith now has the opportunity at today’s H.C. Wainwright Conference to discuss how the cores looked — offering investors an early glimpse of the project’s expansion potential ahead of the updated resource estimate and Q4 DFS. This sets the stage for Elk Creek to further validate its position as America’s flagship source of scandium, niobium, titanium, and rare earths, with core results as the next decisive catalyst.*

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brewers vs. Rangers: A Same-Game Parlay Worth Your Buxom Bucks**  
*By DataSkrive’s Most Charismatic Algorithm*

The Milwaukee Brewers, baseball’s answer to a perfectly aged cheddar (sharp, dominant, and slightly underappreciated), take on the Texas Rangers, who are currently playing like a travel trailer trying to pass for a mansion. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB closer and the humor of a D-batter trying to explain why they swung at a 3-0 pitch.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Math, Mayhem, and a Sprinkle of Mayonnaise

The Brewers (-1.5, +150) are the underdogs on the moneyline (-104) but favorites to cover the spread. Why the spread disconnect? Simple: Milwaukee’s offense is a cheeseburger festival (second in runs, 726 on the season), while Texas’ offense is a salad bar that forgot to include the dressing (20th in runs, 610). The Over/Under is 8.5 runs, with the Over priced at \~1.90-1.95 across books.

**Key numbers:**

* **Brewers’ offense:** William Contreras (.263 BA, 17 HR) and Brice Turang (.291 BA, 17 HR) are the team’s version of a “Most Likely to Succeed” award winner.
* **Rangers’ pitching:** The staff ERA (3.47) is elite, but Jacob Latz (1-0, 3.15 ERA) has yet to record a win in 29 starts this season. That’s like being a DJ who’s never dropped the needle on a hit.
* **Brewers’ pitching:** Jose Quintana (3.72 ERA) has won 4 of his last 5 starts, including a 6⅓-inning gem against Philly. He’s the team’s version of a “meh, okay” coffee that somehow keeps you awake.

**Implied probabilities:**

* Brewers to win ML: \~50.2% (from -104).
* Rangers to cover +1.5: \~39.2% (from +150 spread odds).
* Over 8.5 runs: \~51.3% (from 1.90 decimal odds).

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Quotes, and Existential Crises

**Brewers:** Quintana is “here for something big,” per his pre-game quote. Translation: He wants to avoid becoming a September scapegoat. Milwaukee’s injury list is a who’s-who of “we’re probably replacing you next offseason,” but their depth has held up like a Wisconsin snowbank in July.

**Rangers:** Latz, the starter, is a reliever in disguise, and his “mindset’s the same”

1nbknkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1nbknkv/explore_if_hoover_max_strength_stain_remover/,Explore if Hoover Max Strength Stain Remover Really Works,"**A Handy Helper for Tough Stains**

Using the Hoover AH33050, I discovered that battling stubborn stains no longer feels like a losing war. This aerosol spray boasts a bold claim of being ""max strength,"" and honestly, I was a little skeptical at first. After several mess-filled weeks of testing it around my home, those doubts were wiped away faster than a coffee stain soaked in this miracle cleaner.

Right off the bat, I was impressed by how effortless it is to use. The instructions are beautifully simple: shake, spray, let it sit for a bit, blot, and you're done. I tested it on red wine (classic clumsy move while watching TV), greasy fast-food spills on car seat upholstery, coffee blunders, and even an older lipstick smudge that seemed determined to ruin my carpet. The results were consistently impressive, with stains visibly fading and disappearing entirely in most cases. For something that's so easy to use, the Hoover Max Strength Stain Remover does a phenomenal job.

**Performance That Stands Out**

Let's talk about the standout feature: deep stain penetration. Many carpet spot cleaners promise to deal with surface stains but fail to dig deep enough to tackle what's below. This is where the product shines, pun intended. During my testing, I noticed how quickly it soaked into carpet fibers and fabric upholstery. After letting it sit for just a few minutes, blotting with a towel revealed the stain lifting away—not smearing around. Even set-in stains from my culinary experiments (hello, spaghetti sauce!) didn’t stand a chance.

[Find the best price for Hoover AH33050 on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b097nfmg8m/)  

The aerosol spray approach also plays a big role. The focused spray made it possible to tackle small, targeted areas without wasting the solution on unaffected zones. Versatility is another massive win here; the product handled carpets, car interiors, and even stairs with impressive ease. It’s genuinely close to delivering on that ""whole home cleaning"" promise Hoover makes.

**Boons of the Hoover Max Strength Spray**

- The spray works fast and penetrates deeply into fabric and carpet fibers.  
- Effective on multiple types of stains, like grease, wine, and even older, more stubborn messes.
- Free of phosphates, phthalates, and parabens, which makes me feel better about using it around my family and pets.
- The fresh scent is pleasant and subtle—not overwhelming like some cleaners tend to be.
- The aerosol design allows for precise application without over-saturating the target area.

**Potential Caveats to Note**

- While it works well on most materials, I found it slightly less effective with certain thick upholstery, like my old recliner fabric. Multiple applications were needed for satisfactory results.  
- The canister itself, while lightweight, isn’t the most ergonomic for prolonged use. My wrist felt a bit sore after tackling larger areas in one go.  
- Like many cleaning products, some stains (think ancient coffee spills) might need a few rounds to completely vanish. Patience is key with this spray.

**Competing Brands Make an Appearance**

For anyone eyeing other options, the Hoover AH33050 has its fair share of competitors in the market. Products like Bissell's SpotClean solutions, for example, offer decent stain-fighting abilities but don’t match the precision of this aerosol spray. While the Bissell is effective, it often requires using additional tools or more manual effort, whereas this spray is grab-and-go. Resolve Carpet Cleaner Spray is another commonly suggested alternative. However, from my experience, it doesn’t tackle deep stains as thoroughly, often faltering with older marks. It’s a matter of simplicity and effectiveness, where Hoover seems to have a slight edge for straightforward stain-fighting.

**Smart Spending and Worth the Purchase?**

Pricewise, it feels like a quality-for-price kind of deal. While I can’t quote exact numbers, the price point feels justified considering the ease of use, reliable performance, and versatility. Compared to other stain removers I’ve tried, I’d say this one balances affordability and efficiency quite well. You’re not shelling out for something that might work; you’re paying for something that more than likely will. Plus, the two-pack format means I always have a backup handy, which translates to even better value.

1nbkmhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1nbkmhh/no_longer_losing_weight_instead_gaining/,"No longer losing weight, instead gaining","Hi, i’m gonna give some background with numbers since i reslly don’t know how to fix this issue. i’ve had problems with eating since i was a kid and i think i developed an eating disorder in middle school (not diagnosed but i don’t know what else to call it) and i lost a lot of weight. for years after i would go through periods of binging and gain a ton of weight then restrict and lose it. i ended up gaining so much weight my junior year of highschool and i basically binged the whole year through stress. continued senior year then the summer after i lost around 40 pounds
I went to college and maintained my weight, but after some time i gained back about 10? then i lost about 20 summer after freshman year.
Now, i’m a sophmore. i started off at 190 then gained to 195 because of some events. but then i pretty rapidly went down to 187 because of limited food options at school and walking a lot. but then suddenly the number stopped decreasing and started increasing and now it’s 193. I have been eating pretty much the same exact thing everyday. I usually have one actual meal around dinner time. in the morning or afternoon i sometimes would make a smoothie, sometimes yogurt, sometimes a fruit or just drink coffee.  i’ve also been regularly getting in over 10k steps and i go to the gym and do both strength training and cardio.
I’m kind of stressed because although i can’t count calories exactly since i’m not in control of what i make and i only eat at the dining hall i know that i’m definitely eating a small amount especially because this same exact diet caused me to lose weight so rapidly before. i even adjusted the food i get at the dining hall to have less rice and no sauces (since i thoight sauces might be causing the problem) and more greens since they’re lower calorie. for the days before when i was losing weight i would snack on some candy and chocolate but i still lost weight and when i would snack on granola I would gain weight, i stopped granola because i thought it was the problem but the number just increases
yesyerday i had boba for lunch, i’ll say that was 500 calories. then i had a rice bowl with chicken and onions and i didn’t finish it but i’ll say that was also 500 just to overestimate. then i had a salad with some feta and collard greens and carrots on the side with some dressing, i’ll give that 300. i had an iced latte with zero calorie sweetener and i’ll say that’s 200. lastly a belvita biscuit which was 210 (said so on the label.) I also had 17k steps, did cardio for an hour, and strength training for 30 minutes. All that comes out to 1710 which is not bad from what i know (it’s a calorie deficit for my height and weight) and most of these numbers are overestimated. and yet my weight increased by 2 pounds over night??
i’m honestly hungry all the time and i’m not even losing weight. i’m worried because being so hungry is stressing me out and now i think if i eat more i won’t even maintain ill just rapidly gain more weight. i don’t know what to do or how to fix this i wish i could reprogram my body 
whenever i lose weight i follow the same routine, i eat very little and exercise and it always works, this has never happened before. when i binge, i don’t really lie to myself about it because i’m aware of my binging. i know theres someone who will say i’m a secret eater or something but I’ve literally been trying to lose weight for 8 years of my life and nothing like this has ever happened to me
i’m sorry for the long post but i’m actually very stressed and tired because i just want to be healthy and normal and be normal about food and stop battling my weight. i’d sincerely appreciate any advice and please be kind

Also, i am only posting this because i’m eating a similar diet but my pattern of weight has changed if my diet was different i wouldn’t post this and instead assume theres things i can’t measure. please remember im not in control of what i eat most of the time because i am a college student, so i can’t know what’s really in my food. i would have assumed the rice or chicken has a lot of oil i don’t know about ect if it had always made me gain weight but that’s not the case. i hope that makes sense",1,1757329192.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,0.6,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


#### **1. Various Artists - Land Of The Rising Bass [Viper Recordings]**  
*Recommended if you like: Expanding your Western-centric Horizon*  

A couple of years ago, a friend and I stumbled upon a series or compilation albums called _BASS CHASERS_, full of unique ideas and straight-up bangers, created by a plethora names we had literally never heard of before. Looking into it, it turned out we found ourselves in the thicket of the relatively small but absolutely thriving Japanese drum & bass scene, and we quickly fell deeper and deeper into it, checking out discographies, watching live streams, the whole rigmarole. Earlier this year, we even had the opportunity to finally see some of our favourite names live in Tokyo's WOMB, and we couldn't have been happier with the experience! 

Why am I telling you all this? Well, turns out **Viper**'s very own _Futurebound_ has an _extensive_, decades-spanning history with the country and all the names we had become massive fans of, and has been working on gathering and honouring them all with a very special compilation: The **Land Of The Rising Bass** EP! So, allow me to introduce some of the many talented artists holding up the fort roughly halfway across the globe, starting with... 

**1.1. mimiiQ, YASUKI - Chase The Light**

**YASUKI**! While his youthful energy might make you think we're talking about a very new name here, Yasuki Morioka's career actually goes all the way back to 2006, when he first made a name for himself out in Kyōto! As he eventually moved to Tokyo, he quickly became a long-reigning resident of the legendary 06S parties - where my friend and I actually saw him live, many years later! While known for a mean mix for quite a while already, it would take until 2017 for his first own productions to grace the online spheres, with countless self-released originals, and bootlegs of _Monster Rion_, _Suchmos_, _サカナクション_, _Martin Solveig_, _PizzaBozz!!_, _偽名_, _Evan Michael Green_, _サカナクション_, _Gryffin_, _サカナクション_ and _Eli Brown_. What a list! Fast-forward to 2023 and the YASUKI project finally made it onto streaming services, YASU-KIcking things off with his debut on _Outertone_, and swiftly expanding onto imprints like _Manifest_, _DeVice_, _Automata_, and _UMBRL_, collaborating with fellow up-and-comers _Xtinctor_, _ICONS_, _Quoone_, and _Hyper Senses_ in the process. 

Speaking of teamwork, this opener is actually a collab with fellow '94er Yuya Yoneichi, artistically known as **mimiiQ**! Fun fact, he's usually more of a Techno and Tech House kinda guy! Since 2021, he has been Yonei-chipping away at the bassy four-to-the-floor genres, working together with _Qwerty_, _Kohey_, _AOY_, _VEATZ_ (it's funny to me how different artist names in different genres), remixing _tAisuke_ and even surfing all the way to a gold medal in _m-flo_'s remix competition! 

Fusing current trends of Tech House et al. with the Dancefloor tendencies of his partner in crime here, their collab **Chase The Light** utilises the battle-tested combination of hypnotically robotic vocals, 8th note chuggas and a simple, and thus intensely catchy melody, to create one hell of a chune. Some squelchiness here, some trance type vocal choppery in the breakdown there, and a whole assortment of sound effects - including the legendary _Sewer Surfin'_ stab - mixed into it, and you got a banger on your hands. 

**1.2. DJYOUTH - Without You**

Next up, we got someone coming from an entirely different direction: **DJYOUTH**! Daichi Inoue, the man behind the youthful moniker, has been noticeably more UK-y in his influences than his peers, even before he moved to London in 2024. His first couple of releases, whether on _Ravesta_, _FVYDID_, and _PMP_, or on his own SoundCloud as part of his various edit packs, were actually all situated in the _Bassline_ corner! While smithing up more basslinery on the likes of _Kayak_, _3000 Bass_, and _Future Cuts_, witnessing his tune _Latency_ being used for Valorant's _VCT2023_ tournament, and playing out shows at _Club Camelot_ and _Armani_ concept stores, Daichi was quietly preparing to Dai-change course entirely. Starting with his 2022 edit of _Harry Styles'_ 'As It Was', continuing with the first of many _Arc Nade_ collaborations on _NUCRU_, and with his move to the UK fully embracing it, DJYOUTH had become a bit of a DnB project. Guest mixes for Subtle Radio and Kool/Rinse FM, participating in _CRUCAST_'s Front2Front format, releasing on _YANA_, _DMR_, _Riot_, _Bassrush_, and _Jadu Dala_,  and winning _Rendah_'s remix competition, catapulting him onto the main label he adores so much - he truly has arrived in the DnB scene nowadays. 

As you can perhaps tell from this short history lesson, Daichi takes things into a, let's say, _jumpier_ direction with his production, and **Without You** is no exception there. Various reverberating elements bouncing through our heads like ghostly pinballs, plus a main lead arriving from quite far away, we are eventually snapped into place by the titular vocal, which leads us right into a storm of punchy drums and relentlessly hitting, heavily distorted synths - that's a banger. 

**1.3. Mountain - Warn You**

On place three on this tracklist we've got arguably the most well-known of them all, Shigeta Kamiyama! Not ringing a bell? How about **Mountain**, then? Making waves since at least 2017, when he debuted on none other than _Hospital_, and quickly added further European big shots like _Soulvent_, _Medschool_(RIP), _RAM_ (RIP), _High Tea_ and _Fokuz_ to his discography, he is one of Japan's most successful DnB exports in recent times! Throughout the late '10s and early '20s he not only broadened his horizons with output on _Viper_, _onesevenfour_, _Pilot_, _NUCRU_, _Manifest_ and _DMR_, he also delivered an absolutely Kamiy-amazing debut album on Soulvent! You see, if it wasn't for the one-paragraph-per-artist rule I have instantiated for this, I could've yapped for way, _way_ longer about this one! 

Going deeper and in a way, UK-ier, right away, with warning sirens turned rhythmic whomps, noticeably colder atmospheric work and an MC sample bringing the sauce, **Warn You** does in fact do what it says on the tin, before the house inevitably burns down. Introduced with a slight delay, the drop we're dealing with here shifts gears way further down, into the troughs of filth of modern Jump Up, where disgustingly brain-tickling squelch and snippy drums reign freely, the sound design evolves so much it goes from bassface-inducing madness to existential crises, and all sorts of incredible buildup trickery hype you up to infinity. Especiallly those YOIOIOI's in the second half are just insane!

**1.4. DJ AKi, Yellock - Destruction & Rebirth**

Speaking of artists whose stories could fill up whole books, let's talk about the literal legend that is **DJ AKi**! Obsessed with early DnB and Jungle and mentored by _Breakbeat Science_ co-founder _DARA_ since the days of 1996, AKi lived out his best DJing life over in New York City, soaking up the exciting musical directions wherever and whenever he could, before moving back to Tokyo in 2000, where he didn't take long to set up shop in the one and only _WOMB_ club. Through a series of mix CDs, AKi managed to attract an international audience, through which he not only travelled the world to further spread the gospel of Japanese DnB, but which also landed him an early release on _Hospital_'s _Future Sound Of Tokyo_ in 2007, when he was still operating as **ES9**. Around the same time, in 2006, he also launched his own imprint, **06S Records**, which has also been holding regular raves at WOMB, to this day! There's so much more to fill these gaps with, but let's jump to today, where you can hear the stalwart champion of the scene all around the country, from his _All Night Long_ sessions at WOMB, to the _RECOMBINATION_ series aimed at bridging the generational gaps, to the multi-hour collaborative _JUPITER_ journeys, to live on Twitch - which brought me _immense_ joy during lockdown! Plus, his recent productions have seen him working with none other than _Audio_, and digital human being **Yellock**, who also features on this one!

Gak Nagamatsu, perhaps better known as the man behind The First Virtual Being™ that is his digital twin **Yellock**, has been pulling us into his digital world for quite some time now, but looking into him unveiled even more creativity and talent than I had ever imagined! The project does in fact go all the way back to 2013, to the guitar fanatic's _Re:Rock_ of _ASY_'s _See The Lights_ - another project of DJ AKi's, together with _STY_ and _YUUKi MC_! However, his real life twin mostly took over at first, managing the marketing for Ultra in Japan, launching his own creative production company _Yellow, Inc_ with clients all over the world, designing Tech Art for _MUTEK_, and even growing into _WOMB_'s marketing manager! Working as a producer for _Digz,Inc._, he also kept leveling up his skill set and by the 2020s, he fired off his own productions all over the place, from Future Trap to Drumstep to, of course, DnB. Working with legends like _AKi_ and _Shimon_, his digital twin, developed by Mimic, built his own universe full of Dancefloor wonderfulness, and, through his work with _CARTOON_ and _Fiftee West_, all sorts of other tempos. Further highlights include his _Virtual Human Being_ and _Post Virtual Humanism_ LPs, his excellent live shows with bespoke visuals, his regular Twitch streams, his remix competition winning rework of _Futurebound_'s Dangerous, and him being remixed by the likes of _Zardonic_! He has been a busy bee!

As expected from the talents involved, and the name of the track frankly, **Destruction & Rebirth** opens to a wonderfully epic intro, with festival opening show type vocals giving this cyclical concept a voice and big ol' capital W Whomps raising the heartrate of everyone in its vicinity. Merging the various styles of both AKi, who is often a bit of a Neuro head, and Yellock, who mainly takes aim at creating Dancefloor bangers, this one drops into a straight-up lethal dose of 4x4, where waves of heavily distorted melodics are sliced into the tiniest of pieces, before eventually dropping into the Whomp-fueled syncopated rhythm that you can't help but shout and nod along to. I love it!

**1.5. Maozon - Escape**

Remember this one? Keen readers will know this is not the first time I have tried to show you the ways of Japanese DnB, with [my deep dive](https://redd.it/ulomzg/) of **Maozon**'s 2022 album, _Vertical Flip_! While I sadly did not manage to catch him live yet, I did at least play one of his tunes on an arcade machine in Akihabara, and that counts for something in my head. Since the last time we spoke about him, he not only released another absolutely wonderful follow-up album, _Ascension_, in 2023, but also curated the _Foundations_ compilation on his _UMBRL_ album, and delivered one tune after the other on labels like _hypernight_, _eMPIRE SOUND SYSTeMS_, _Phantom Dub_, _wavforme_, and _TOKYO HARD DANCE_ - oh how I love it all so dearly!

So what did he bring to the Viper table then? **Escape**! Multi-layered robotic vocals continuing the theme of concepts speaking their mind, fun bubbly synth melodies creeping in, and with a healthy dose of Sewer Surfin' stings, we are off! A proppa chugga that gives your body ample opportunity to find a rhythm to bounce off of, giving the synth insect the chance to flutter all over the place in a way that's simply incredibly satisfying, and allowing the vocals to shine once more. Maoz-on point!

**1.6. Azumai - Guilty Of Murder**

Now for a completely different vibe: Let's talk about Yuki **Azumai**! Compared to some of the above examples, this Japanese-Russian fella is relatively new to the scene, but has already integrated incredibly well. During his time living in London, he worked as a sound engineer at the iconic _XOYO_, but the first proof of musical life of his own - that I could find - goes back to a remix for Japan's answer to Pendulum that is _The Game Shop_ in 2020! Of course, he also delivered the phatness on _Mountain_ and _Maozon_ collab _Hello_ on _ProgRAM_ and his Hackney Parrot bootleg in 2021, but the real kick-off of his career came in 2023: An entire EP on ProgRAM, two deadly singles on _In The Lab_, another collab with Maozon, an entry on a certain Dutch label's _The Future Sound Of Korsakov_ compilation, and a full-on B2B with Teddy Killerz on the legendary Let It Roll bus! His uniquely techy, dark sounds quickly caught the attention of many more players, leading to releases on _Critical_, _Weapon Audio_ and even a full-scale EP on _VISION_ earlier this year! 

As such, Yuki takes us to a way darker place than what came before, both on this compilation and on Viper in general, with an uncharactistically deep and dark admission of guilt, on **Guilty Of Murder**. Starting off as a rhythm of speaker-blowing bass stabs on top of two-step drums, things swing back and forth into faster action and back to steppy territory, while the main elements evolve into forces of natures in their own right. More and more, the bass hits involuntarily scrunch up our collective faces and the growls start actively melting brains all over the place, to the point the only word I can describe this madness of sound design with is _unhinged_. In the best possible sense, of course!

**1.7. Seventhrun - Bouncy**

Finally, new name numero seven, **Seventhrun**! I mean, where else could he be placed at! Filling in yet another entirely different niche, Kosei Itani, aka **Seventhrun**, originally comes from the world of Happy Hardcore, with his _Avicii_ bootleg in 2013 being one of the earliest remnants of his early craft. Hardstyle, Bounce, Happy Hardcore, Future Bass, Colour Bass, Big Room, he did it all, but in between those fun explorations of sound, he also regularly came back to, you guessed it, DnB! From his Drumstep version of _Forget Not_ and 2015's _Dusk Of Summer_ to his regular releases on the aforementioned _Bass Chasers_ albums, he was always fun to keep an eye on for DnB lovers, but things became even more exciting in the last couple of years. Not only has he graced various various artistry projects on _High Tea_, he's also one of the faces of rising US Dancefloor forge _Manifest_, delivering bangers en masse.

Opening with a rather ominous atmosphere and a brief few bars of deep rap vocals, **Bouncy** quickly turns up the energy, with its heavily processed titular vocals taking no time - or arguably a tiny bit of time, due to its delayed drop nature - to launch us into a hurricane of heavyweight machinery, absolute Ko-seismic drums and a wild assortment of sound effects. Not a whole lot more to say about this one, itsa slapper!

**1.8. Conclusion**

Not only thematically a simply lovely project, but also delivering bangers in spades and bringing in unique flavours from all across the spectrum, in ways you might not have heard them yet. Subarashī!

Evan stood still in front of the sunrise, watching the soft light stretch across the digital horizon. And for the first time in over trillions upon trillions of years, it wasn’t the same sunrise. A bird’s path through the sky was slightly different. A child’s laughter in the park below was unfamiliar. The coffee stand he passed on his morning walk had a new flavour on the menu.  
  
Time was moving forward.  
  
He had to be sure. He spent the entire day verifying it repeating what he had done countless times before, but this time, the difference was undeniable. The loop had broken. The cycle had ended. But, how? Had he triggered that changed?  
  
He didn’t want to be alone when he confirmed it.  
  
At 07:00 a.m., Evan sat at a corner table in the café they used to frequent before everything fell into repetition. The place was quiet, bathed in amber morning light. One by one, his closest friends arrived Sonia, Daniel, Tina each still brushing off the haze of sleep, drawn not by habit, but by urgency. There was something in Evan’s voice when he asked them to come. Something different.  
  
Evan’s voice trembled as he spoke not from fear, but from feeling. For the thousandth time, he told them everything. About the loops, the resets, the endless days. About the pain of remembering when no one else could. But this time, the story landed differently. There was no dead glaze in their eyes. No hollow nods or polite confusion.  
  
They listened.  
  
As Evan finished explaining everything, a calm silence settled over the nearly empty cafeteria. The faint hum of appliances and the occasional clink of a spoon were the only sounds breaking the stillness. In that quiet morning light, as his friends sat processing the truth, Evan knew with certainty that the change was real. They were no longer just dead simulations. Not fully aware yet—but the spark he had been breathing into them for years was there, unmistakable and stronger than ever.  
  
Sonia was the first to break the silence. Her fingers traced the rim of her tea glass, her mind already racing.  
  
""From a systems perspective,"" she began, voice calm but intense, ""a process only changes its output when it receives new, unprocessed input. Something that redirects the flow of entropy. From what you’ve described... the loop existed because the system had reached a kind of digital thermodynamic equilibrium. Maximum entropy. Nothing new could happen anymore.""  
  
She lifted her glass, the steam still curling upward. ""Think of this tea. While it’s hot, particles are in motion energy flowing, change constantly occurring. But once it cools, it stabilizes. No more transformation. That’s what our world had become: lukewarm, stagnant.""  
  
She set the glass down and looked directly at Evan.  
  
""You’ve been heating the system again. Stirring its particles. Reintroducing energy into a closed system. You didn’t just break the loop, Evan… you reanimated a dead world.""  
  
Evan felt a weight lift from his chest. He had heard this theory before, countless times, but always tinged with despair. Sonia had once explained it as a eulogy for time. Today, her voice carried something new.  
  
Hope.  
  
Tina leaned forward, her hands clasped in front of her.  
  
""If that’s true,"" she said softly, ""then it means Evan’s been reaching people. A lot of people. Enough to generate real change."" She turned to him, eyes wide. ""Do you know how many you’ve awakened?""  
  
Evan hesitated. ""It varied. For deeper connections, sometimes a week. Others took longer. I guess… over the last five years... maybe around 260?""  
  
Daniel frowned. ""That’s not many. Not compared to how many people exist in this system. Sonia, is that really enough to tip the balance?""  
  
Sonia considered the question, then nodded slowly. ""It shouldn’t be. But we’re in uncharted territory. These emotional connections your threads, Evan maybe they work like chain reactions. One spark ignites another. A single ember can light an entire forest.""  
  
Tina smiled, her energy radiant. ""I believe that. Music works the same way. A song touches one person, and suddenly it spreads. It transforms everyone who hears it and even those who only feel the echoes.""  
  
Sonia remained sceptical but didn’t object. ""I want to believe that...""  
  
A moment passed before her words settled. The group sat in quiet reflection, the air between them buzzing with something they hadn’t felt in ages: anticipation. They had broken the curse. The future was no longer a myth it was unfolding before them.  
  
Then, at 8:30 a.m., everything changed.  
  
The café had a tradition of keeping the news stream off customers preferred silence, a final moment of peace before facing the world. But the moment the feed flickered to life, the news struck like a blow. Their faces drained of colour as the headlines unfolded.  
  
And the world shattered.  
  
A news anchor, visibly shaken, was mid-report. Behind her played looping aerial footage of chaos: a concert arena, torn apart. Emergency response drones swarmed over the ruins. The death toll was climbing hundreds of thousands gone in an instant.  
  
The cause: a coordinated terrorist attack.  
  
The first in the simulation’s history.  
  
Sonia’s tea slipped from her fingers and shattered on the floor. Tina’s hand flew to her mouth as she gasped. Daniel’s eyes froze on the screen, his breath caught in his throat.  
  
It was impossible. In this world this carefully constructed afterlife violence of this magnitude had been engineered out. Mental irregularities were filtered, resolved. The system had been designed to protect its citizens from themselves.  
  
Until now.  
  
Two thoughts struck them all with equal force.  
  
Either Evan’s awakening had introduced chaos into the system had made such horror possible again.  
  
Or someone else had awakened.

1nbkj98,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nbkj98/the_day_i_emerged_from_a_crevice/,The Day I Emerged from a Crevice,"It is a beautiful Friday morning, and I have woken up in a cramped motel room. The smell of wet cardboard is hard to ignore here. On the nightstand is a photograph of my parents. It sways rapidly from side to side, which is odd considering there are no windows or fans in this room to cause even a slight breeze. My hands float over my torso, as if detached from my body, and I can hear a faucet dripping in the next room.

My legs carry me outside. The street curves inward and outward periodically, making it difficult to walk on the wobbling ground beneath me. Every person who passes me smiles, but their smiles retract quickly, like a rubber band stretched tight and suddenly released. Then their faces are replaced by static.

I make my way to my favourite café. I have been here many a time with my friends. The neon signs on the walls flicker with the words *‘LOOK AWAY’*. The radio is playing songs backwards. My dad used to play most of these when I was a child, driving me around in his car.  
  
The waitress asks me for my order. Her voice changes with every second, and so does her face. I order my usual coffee, and the radio turns to white noise.  Within a few seconds, it is back up again. Clear and unwarped, it is playing The Great Gig in the Sky by Pink Floyd; it is not backwards this time.

*“And I am not frightened of dying, you know*  
*Any time will do, I don't mind*  
*Why should I be frightened of dying?*  
*There's no reason for it*  
*You've gotta go sometime.”*

The waitress arrives with my order. I thank her and the radio turns to static again. A pale man comes over to my seat and sits next to me. We shake hands as if we have known each other for a really long time. But I have never ever seen this man before in my life. In fact, I’d like it if he stays far, far away from me.

“I don’t think you belong here.” He comes closer to me and whispers in my ear. Simultaneously, he is playing with the rings on his fingers. He has quite a few of them.

“I don’t?” I reply, taking another sip of my coffee. His breath stinks.

“You do not. Because you are just watching. Why? Watching isn’t living.” He says that with a grin on his face, and winks. As if he just shared a secret that I have been dying to know. What does he even mean by that?

Behind us, I see a couple kissing as maggots emerge from their eyes and eat away at their skin. Both of them scream in unison as green pus oozes out of them in place of blood. Their faces are changing rapidly and their voices are too. Their faces are changing so fast that it almost looks like static to me. Somehow, no one else seems to notice them.

The pale man is still gawking right at me. He is looking at me like he hasn’t seen another human being before. He is completely bald, and his skin is as smooth as a baby’s. He has huge bulging eyes and he still hasn’t gotten rid of the shit-eating grin from his face. He does not blink. An indescribable disgust emerges from the very pits of my gut.

“Why are you talking to me?” I ask him, my drink almost over. I am about to gag, retch and subsequently throw up all over him.

“Because you don’t belong here. Do you want to take a walk with me?” He says, his face curled into a frown now. And just like all those people on the street, his frown retracts quickly.

I somehow manage to stop myself from throwing up, and reply ‘No, thanks’. I get up from my seat and walk away from him. I pay for my coffee and the bill seems to dissolve right into my arms.

I walk out from the café and there is nobody else on the street now. It starts to rain. In the middle of the road, I notice a huge transmission tower. It is emanating a low groaning sound that sounds like the cries of a huge, yet hurt creature. Deciding that it wouldn’t be safe for me to pass through there, I change my route.

I want to go back to my motel and take a long, hot shower. I make a right turn and soon, I am inside a forest. I feel vines crawling around my ankles and insect bites traversing up to my thighs. However, I do not feel much pain. I don’t understand why.  
  
As I walk through the forest, I notice a lake nearby and I see the pale man from the café standing near it, beckoning me to come towards him. The lake water is as blue as the sky on a clear summer afternoon, with a surface so inviting that I might just shed all my clothes and swim in it. However, the pale man irritates me. I don’t want to go towards him.  
  
I change my lane and open Google Maps on my phone. Somehow, I still have a network signal. Is it because of the massive transmission tower erected on the main road?

I walk through the treacherous forest, the vines around my ankles making my journey significantly difficult. The forest too, like the streets in the morning, start to wobble. But somehow, finally, I reach the location where my motel is supposed to be. And lo, and behold.

There is absolutely nothing there. Google Maps tells me that I’ve reached my destination, and my phone promptly shuts down.

A man on horseback passes by me. A closer look reveals that the man is the pale man from the café. He has a grin on his face, wide and unsettling, and it doesn’t snap back like a rubber band.

The horse’s lips part, and it speaks: “Who am I?”.

Without thinking, I hurl my phone at the man. It shatters against his chest, and the man’s face turns to static and he disappears, along with his horse. Stunned, I blink, trying to process what just happened.

Then I see them, mom and dad, running toward me. When they reach me, they embrace me so tightly I nearly fall to the ground. Their kisses flood my face, and for the first time in a while, I feel something - relief. Maybe we will find a way out of this.

Suddenly, the earth beneath us gives way with a thunderous roar. A massive explosion erupts under my feet, and my parents and I plunge into the gaping hole. I am enveloped in dust as I close my eyes.

When I open them again, I’m lying on the cold ground, surrounded by a crowd of familiar faces - people from my neighbourhood and my parents. I cough, splutter, and blink away the dust clinging onto my throat and eyes. Near us, there is a crack, too thin for anyone to have crawled through. Yet somehow, I came through it. I know I did. Exhausted, I fall asleep almost immediately.

When I finally wake, everything that follows is surreal. I am on my bed, after having been taken home by my parents. They explain to me that our quiet town, usually untouched by tragedy, had been rocked by two shocks back-to-back. First, I disappeared after basketball practice without a trace. Then came the earthquake, a 5.3 magnitude that shook everything to its core. It (thankfully) didn’t cause much damage, other than the crack in the ground.  
  
Miraculously, I reappeared in the park where I played as a child, covered in insect bites and dust, barely conscious until they jolted me awake by splashing a bucket of water on my face. All the while, I’d been murmuring something about a pale man with bulging eyes.

Althea and Phineas waited in the busy town square.  Plaska captains, the Riverwatch, and the postal order all had part in the public chaos occurring on the steps of city hall.  The postal vicar was screaming at the river guards’ commander, while the local Order Magister’s assistant chimed in to amplify their distaste.  The local stadtholder’s courtier was attempting to quell the unrest amongst the parties. 

Bounty postings in the square indicated this was by far not the first raid by the Water Tigers.  Various guilds and factions all offered rewards for the capture of the bandits for different offenses.  The sketch of their leader was distinctive, describing piercing green eyes and scars above his right eye.

Althea was munching on a breakfast roll as Phineas studied the town square, the fox still twitchy from too much morning coffee.  The large, smooth gray dam loomed upstream, holding back the reservoir fed by the Tenaska River.  The downtown area was old, dominated by ancient, smooth stone architecture. 

The old city lay between the confluence of the Tenaska and the Grassmere rivers.  The Tenaska seemed like a mere stream compared to the breadth of the larger river.  Fireboats puffed up and down the river pulling barges and plaskas, sparks flying from their tall smokestacks.

Stained with age, an ancient glass arch gleamed large over the square.  It was solid, a single fused form of glass, fired millennia ago from the twisted trunks and branches of ancient glasstrees. The veins of green and brown still shone through, forever entombed in the solidified glass.  

Phineas stood in front of the historic plaque near the arch while Althea continued watching the bickering officials, her ears straining to hear the arguments. 

Phineas’ eyes traced the delicate glass vines, bent into elegant filigrees and braids.  Below the arch was a large marble block, scarred with the erosion of time.  The ancient engraving stood out boldly which Phineas recognized, despite being backwards from modern writing.

“*Vox aequitatem praestat*,” he muttered to himself.  “The founding law of Kerik.  *Voice grants equality.*”

“Much easier said than done.”  Althea glanced at Phineas before returning her attention to the shouting match in progress.  Shouts of terms like ‘dereliction of duty’ and ‘the upcoming election’ dominated the fight in front of city hall.

After some agreement was apparently made, the crowd disbursed from the steps after a round of handshakes.  Felmar, who had been standing with the captain of their plaska, walked down the stairs toward Althea with a grimace.

“My lady, zis all has created quite the, eh, stink.  Riverwatch will strike back tonight, ‘supported’ by ze stadtholder.”

Althea thought about this, tapping her hind hoof.  “We’ve got to get in on this.”  *I need to find that damn book.*

Althea looked around, unable to find the fox.  Eventually she found him, staring closely at a damaged section of the granite block.  He was feeling the stone with his paws, then writing in a notebook. 

“C’mon Phinney, we’ve got someone to meet.”

“Just a moment…”  Phineas continued to feel the block, looking intently before sketching more symbols. His tail still twitched, with an occasional spark at the white tip.  “Something used to be carved here.”

He held up his notebook to Althea.  She shook her head, unable to decipher the strange words.  The letters were like the old law engraving, but different, with curves instead of all sharp strokes.

Felmar peered at the notebook and sighed heavily.  “Ze old, forbidden tongue.”  He looked back and forth, drawing Althea and Phineas closer with a finger. Felmar let out a whisper, nearly drowned out by the passing hubbub of the square.

“Do not repeat zis out loud ever.  Understood?”  He waited for nods from Althea and Phineas.  “It says *New Saint Louis - established in the Year of Our Lord 2852*.”

Felmar’s grin of anticipation fell when met with Althea’s blank stare and uneasy shrug.  Her ears twitched, troubled by the archer’s tone. Phineas, however, scratched behind his ear deep in thought.  *That name… wasn’t it in that old story?  Why is it forbidden?*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The summer intern plucked nervously at his secondhand robes as he pretended to shuffle and sort papers.  His eyes fretted nervously between the centaur and the fox waiting for him in the lobby.  The Nostlyesh outpost of the Order of the Silver Star was far more impressive than that of Duvano-Stonebrace, clearly meant for more genteel guests. 

Elegant marble tiles covered the floors, with delicate lounges and wingback chairs upholstered in fine linen.  He could already see scratches in the tiles from the warrior’s steel horseshoes, and red fur was sticking to the pristine white linen.   The intern shuddered as the fox stretched out on his seat, snagging his claws on the floral damask.

Althea’s back hoof started jumping, tapping loudly on the tile.  The intern knew he couldn’t delay any further.  He recalled the stories he’d heard in school about this centaur - *Big Stony, they called her.  No magic but as mean as they come*.  Clearing his throat, he stepped out into the lobby from behind the polished worktop.

“Ahem, Ms. Stonehoof, I’m sorry that the Magister is away.  He has traveled downriver to attend the festival in Nodessa.  For, um, research purposes, of course.  I believe he is joining your old mentor Marcus for a project.”

She nodded drily.   “Go on.”

“So, you see, I’m not authorized for any extraordinary business on behalf of the order.  This issue of the parcel must simply be handled later-”

The tapping hoof came down with a sharp crack, fracturing the tile below.

“Look here, Failing, -”

“Falen.”

“Whatever.  Brittany up in Stonebrace-”

“You mean Magesse Vaelwynn.”

Althea’s eyes narrowed, staring down at the intern.  The collar of his tunic suddenly felt tight as the warrior loomed over him.  “I’ll call her whatever I like.  *Britt* sent a cursed book from an ancient renegade order through the f&\*&\^% mail!  Do you realize how much negative exposure the Order will get if the public finds out?”

She took a step closer, backing the apprentice against the counter. 

“And, more importantly for you-” she pointed down at him - “do you know what the Council would do to the officious little prick that stood by and did nothing when eldritch curses spread across the land?  To the idiot that prevented duly appointed agents of the Order from doing their sworn duty?”

The intern began to sweat, tugging at his collar.  Althea turned her head and nodded to Phineas, hiding her smile from the frightened clerk.

The fox raised his Guild booklet in a paw, pointing at the Order’s seal emblazoned over Brittany’s sigil that signified his status as an Order contractor.

“Wh-, what can I do to help?”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The motley team assembled at the city’s docks, along the high side of the dam.  Two steam launches were tied up at the ready, their boilers building steam in the waning daylight.  Phineas watched closely from his perch on Althea’s back, taking in the sight of the assembling crowd.

The stadtholder’s courtier nervously flitted between the different groups, trying to assure himself of the cobbled-together coalition.  A small squad of Riverwatch waited in loose formation, distinguished in their uniforms of patterned blues, their silken and segmented plate armor vests on display.  The stadtholder even sent two of her personal soldiers, decked out in the finest of dull black plate armor, to join the raid to assuage her concern of the disparate groups’ quarrels.  The guards from the plaskas, including Felmar, fidgeted nearby, feeling out of place in their assorted rough gear. 

The captain of the Riverwatch was conversing with the courtier and a postal priest when one of the stadtholder’s soldiers sidled up to a bemused Althea.

*Great, another centaur.*

The centaur guard looked up at Althea, trying an awkward smile as she pointed at the waiting boats.  “Hi, I’m Corporal Tessa.” 

She reached up to shake Althea’s hand but then rubbed the back of her neck under her tightly braided hair, looking away from Althea’s piercing look.  “How do you handle, you know, small boats?  I must admit, my legs get a bit shaky on the water.” 

Althea grimaced at the smaller centaur, trying to size up this so-called soldier.  Although a bit older than Althea, the pristine nature of her armor and barding suggested the centaur had more of a ceremonial role in the city than any real experience. 

“Plaskas and proper fireboats don’t rock too much.  For these damn little boats, you just have to suck it up.  Get as low in the boat as possible when it rocks and focus on the mission, not the motion.  Keep your hooves still as possible and shift your weight instead - dancing around makes it worse.”

“Thank you, Ms…”

“Just call me Althea.”

Tessa couldn’t keep from gazing at Althea’s ears.  “So, um, which clan are you from?”

Althea sighed and rolled her eyes.  *Here we go.* 

“I’m not from any clan, at least one that anyone knows about.”  She wiggled her ears, causing the soldier to blush at being caught staring.  “And before you ask, no, I don’t know why I don’t have the little *two-legs* ears like you have.”

Phineas laughed at the exchange, surprising Corporal Tessa when she realized his presence.

Althea jabbed a thumb back at the fox on her back.  “You don’t even want to know about him.”

The corporal’s blush deepened to near crimson as she took a nervous step backward.

Althea had second thoughts when she realized she may have pushed the little centaur too far.  “So, is that real onyx steel?”  She nodded at the corporal’s black armor and barding.

Regaining her composure, the soldier gladly went along with the subject change.  “Yes, from the city’s salvage reserve.  Nostlyesh has the last lightning forge in all Ecror.”  She unstrapped her left vambrace and handed it up to Althea.  “Stronger than any plate steel.”

Althea turned over the vambrace in her hands, studying the uniform dull black surface.  Even with the glassweave liner, the armor was far lighter than anything she owned, let alone any plate armor she’d seen before.

Althea whistled, handing the forearm armor back.  She looked down at her own repeatedly patched and rebuilt leather armor.  “I sure would love to have a set of that armor.”

“Attention!”  The captain of the Riverwatch stood on a crate, with the Order intern at his side on the pier.  Tall and broad chested, he wore an elaborate blue uniform with gold piping, three gold bars on each of his shoulder boards.

The Riverwatch and city soldiers quickly fell into formation, standing at attention.  The plaska guards shuffled in place uneasily, with only Felmar showing some semblance of military bearing.  Althea simply stood with a glare at the captain, Phineas on her back watching the crowd.

“Some of you may already know part of why we are here.  To make it clear to everyone here, I will repeat, and you will listen!  Is that clear?”

“Yes sir!”  The locals in formation were enthusiastic, but the rest of the assemblage only gave muffled acknowledgement.

The captain scowled.

“The Stadtholder placed me in charge of this operation to clear out the bandits!   Just in case you weren’t clear, that includes you sailors” - pointing at the plaska guards - “and the *irregulars* under Order contracts.” 

The mage-in-training gave a smug look at Althea, causing her to roll her eyes.  Phineas’ gesture was more vulgar, surprising the intern with the shape the fox’s paw could take.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once aboard one of the steam launches, Phineas watched the crew intently, taking in all these new sights, his tail wagging slowly, as the boiler’s mate explained the engine to the mage’s intern.  Althea crouched beside him, legs folded to keep herself low in the launch.  Every movement of the soldiers and guards boarding caused the narrow boat to shimmy, increasing the shade of green that Phineas hadn’t seen in her before.

The small steel boiler was exposed on the deck, with heaps of wood at the ready.  Steam and smoke puffed lazily out the stack, having only been brought up to pressure with a small fire in the box below the boiler.  Steam pipes exited from the top of the boiler out to the two pistons, which were connected by arms to the paddlewheel on either side.  Large levers controlled the flow of steam to each piston, allowing independent control of speed and direction of each wheel.

“Apprentice Falen, do you have the elemental charges the Order pledged?”

The intern turned flush, frantically patting the hidden pockets of his robe.  Eventually, he pulled out a handful of ceramic plugs, covered in intricate symbols and colored runes.

The boiler’s mate carefully took the plugs, then with thickly gloved hands installed them in ports he had uncapped in the firebox and steam exhaust.  Once he closed off the firebox and another valve, the steam and smoke stopped puffing up the stack.  The mate watched as Falen adjusted the ends of the ceramic plugs, nodding in satisfaction as the gauges on the boiler rose.

“These charges require a controller with at least some passing magical affinity.  I can handle the other launch’s boiler.”

“Corporal Tessa, report!”

The small centaur stepped forward with a grimace, gingerly guiding every hoof step on the deck.  Once she neared the boiler, she dropped herself down to the deck with a gasp, copying Althea’s low stance.

The mage gave a smug chuckle, then directed the soldier and crewman on how to operate the charges.

Something about the ceramic charges drew Phineas.  They had a sparkle to them, almost like they were calling to him.  He tapped on Althea’s side, getting her attention away from the deck.

“Ugh, what?”  Her face spoke of nausea and utter discomfort in the small craft.

Phineas pointed at the ceramic plugs Falen carried.  “*What are those?*” he whispered, trying to avoid the attention of the others.

Althea closed her eyes with a grimace.  “Elemental charges, concentrated and converted from other energy sources by mage ritual.  One is charged with fire, the other ice.  You can run a small fireboat like this for hours with no smoke or exhaust with them.  They’re expensive, too costly for normal use.”  She opened her eyes sheepishly, looking into his eyes.  “I ruined a whole batch once just by picking up their case.”

At that explanation, the paddlewheels began to turn as the launch slowly, and silently, backed away from the pier.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The two steam launches slowed as they approached their destination.  Informants had provided the location of the bandits’ base, up the barren valley of a small tributary to the lake.  The glasspatch was eerily silent in the fading light of the day, with no normal plant life nearby. 

Approaching the hidden inlet, the launches barely cleared the branches of the glass trees, finding a small dock hidden inside.  The bandits’ launch was hidden in the inlet, confirming their intel.

As the sailors tied up the launches, the captain and his lieutenant gave the signals to go ashore.  The guards and soldiers quickly disembarked, leaving Tessa and Althea to carefully climb the gangplank to the shore.  Apprentice Falen and the launches’ crew stayed behind, the mage’s apprentice suddenly taking on an uneasy look.

Althea gave a sigh of relief once she was on the solid dock.

The captain gathered the raiding party together.  “The informant stated their base of operations is near the shore, about 500 meters up a dirt path.  It’s an old stone building, some kind of ancient house that they found last year.  We’ll scout the perimeter - expect three sentries.  We’ll be able to see their watchfires as we approach.”

As the light faded, the team crept up the road.  With the blackening sky, the fires of the bandits’ base lit up the glass trees, refracting through the glass.

Noticeably, among the orange and yellow light of the fires, a distinct green glow was pulsing from the roof of the old building.

Althea stopped in her tracks.  The others did the same once they saw the *fel* lights emanating from the bandits’ camp.

Althea turned to Phineas on his perch.  “Looks like we’re too late.”

The smell of wet cardboard is hard to ignore here. On the nightstand is a photograph of my parents. It sways rapidly from side to side, which is odd considering there are no windows or fans in this room to cause even a slight breeze. My hands float over my torso, as if detached from my body, and I can hear a faucet dripping in the next room.

My legs carry me outside. The street curves inward and outward periodically, making it difficult to walk on the wobbling ground beneath me. Every person who passes me smiles, but their smiles retract quickly, like a rubber band stretched tight and suddenly released. Then their faces are replaced by static.

I make my way to my favourite café. I have been here many a time with my friends. The neon signs on the walls flicker with the words *‘LOOK AWAY’*. The radio is playing songs backwards. My dad used to play most of these when I was a child, driving me around in his car.  
  
The waitress asks me for my order. Her voice changes with every second, and so does her face. I order my usual coffee, and the radio turns to white noise.  Within a few seconds, it is back up again. Clear and unwarped, it is playing The Great Gig in the Sky by Pink Floyd; it is not backwards this time.

*“And I am not frightened of dying, you know*  
*Any time will do, I don't mind*  
*Why should I be frightened of dying?*  
*There's no reason for it*  
*You've gotta go sometime.”*

The waitress arrives with my order. I thank her and the radio turns to static again. A pale man comes over to my seat and sits next to me. We shake hands as if we have known each other for a really long time. But I have never ever seen this man before in my life. In fact, I’d like it if he stays far, far away from me.

“I don’t think you belong here.” He comes closer to me and whispers in my ear. Simultaneously, he is playing with the rings on his fingers. He has quite a few of them.

“I don’t?” I reply, taking another sip of my coffee. His breath stinks.

“You do not. Because you are just watching. Why? Watching isn’t living.” He says that with a grin on his face, and winks. As if he just shared a secret that I have been dying to know. What does he even mean by that?

Behind us, I see a couple kissing as maggots emerge from their eyes and eat away at their skin. Both of them scream in unison as green pus oozes out of them in place of blood. Their faces are changing rapidly and their voices are too. Their faces are changing so fast that it almost looks like static to me. Somehow, no one else seems to notice them.

The pale man is still gawking right at me. He is looking at me like he hasn’t seen another human being before. He is completely bald, and his skin is as smooth as a baby’s. He has huge bulging eyes and he still hasn’t gotten rid of the shit-eating grin from his face. He does not blink. An indescribable disgust emerges from the very pits of my gut.

“Why are you talking to me?” I ask him, my drink almost over. I am about to gag, retch and subsequently throw up all over him.

“Because you don’t belong here. Do you want to take a walk with me?” He says, his face curled into a frown now. And just like all those people on the street, his frown retracts quickly.

I somehow manage to stop myself from throwing up, and reply ‘No, thanks’. I get up from my seat and walk away from him. I pay for my coffee and the bill seems to dissolve right into my arms.

I want to go back to my motel and take a long, hot shower. I make a right turn and soon, I am inside a forest. I feel vines crawling around my ankles and insect bites traversing up to my thighs. However, I do not feel much pain. I don’t understand why.  
  
As I walk through the forest, I notice a lake nearby and I see the pale man from the café standing near it, beckoning me to come towards him. The lake water is as blue as the sky on a clear summer afternoon, with a surface so inviting that I might just shed all my clothes and swim in it. However, the pale man irritates me. I don’t want to go towards him.  
  
I change my lane and open Google Maps on my phone. Somehow, I still have a network signal. Is it because of the massive transmission tower erected on the main road?

I walk through the treacherous forest, the vines around my ankles making my journey significantly difficult. The forest too, like the streets in the morning, start to wobble. But somehow, finally, I reach the location where my motel is supposed to be. And lo, and behold.

There is absolutely nothing there. Google Maps tells me that I’ve reached my destination, and my phone promptly shuts down.

A man on horseback passes by me. A closer look reveals that the man is the pale man from the café. He has a grin on his face, wide and unsettling, and it doesn’t snap back like a rubber band.

The horse’s lips part, and it speaks: “Who am I?”.

Without thinking, I hurl my phone at the man. It shatters against his chest, and the man’s face turns to static and he disappears, along with his horse. Stunned, I blink, trying to process what just happened.

Then I see them, mom and dad, running toward me. When they reach me, they embrace me so tightly I nearly fall to the ground. Their kisses flood my face, and for the first time in a while, I feel something - relief. Maybe we will find a way out of this.

Suddenly, the earth beneath us gives way with a thunderous roar. A massive explosion erupts under my feet, and my parents and I plunge into the gaping hole. I am enveloped in dust as I close my eyes.

When I open them again, I’m lying on the cold ground, surrounded by a crowd of familiar faces - people from my neighbourhood and my parents. I cough, splutter, and blink away the dust clinging onto my throat and eyes. Near us, there is a crack, too thin for anyone to have crawled through. Yet somehow, I came through it. I know I did. Exhausted, I fall asleep almost immediately.

When I finally wake, everything that follows is surreal. I am on my bed, after having been taken home by my parents. They explain to me that our quiet town, usually untouched by tragedy, had been rocked by two shocks back-to-back. First, I disappeared after basketball practice without a trace. Then came the earthquake, a 5.3 magnitude that shook everything to its core. It (thankfully) didn’t cause much damage, other than the crack in the ground.  
  
Miraculously, I reappeared in the park where I played as a child, covered in insect bites and dust, barely conscious until they jolted me awake by splashing a bucket of water on my face. All the while, I’d been murmuring something about a pale man with bulging eyes.

1nbkgzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1nbkgzy/the_day_i_emerged_from_a_crevice/,The Day I Emerged from a Crevice,"It is a beautiful Friday morning, and I have woken up in a cramped motel room. The smell of wet cardboard is hard to ignore here. On the nightstand is a photograph of my parents. It sways rapidly from side to side, which is odd considering there are no windows or fans in this room to cause even a slight breeze. My hands float over my torso, as if detached from my body, and I can hear a faucet dripping in the next room.

My legs carry me outside. The street curves inward and outward periodically, making it difficult to walk on the wobbling ground beneath me. Every person who passes me smiles, but their smiles retract quickly, like a rubber band stretched tight and suddenly released. Then their faces are replaced by static.

I make my way to my favourite café. I have been here many a time with my friends. The neon signs on the walls flicker with the words *‘LOOK AWAY’*. The radio is playing songs backwards. My dad used to play most of these when I was a child, driving me around in his car.  
  
The waitress asks me for my order. Her voice changes with every second, and so does her face. I order my usual coffee, and the radio turns to white noise.  Within a few seconds, it is back up again. Clear and unwarped, it is playing The Great Gig in the Sky by Pink Floyd; it is not backwards this time.

*“And I am not frightened of dying, you know*  
*Any time will do, I don't mind*  
*Why should I be frightened of dying?*  
*There's no reason for it*  
*You've gotta go sometime.”*

The waitress arrives with my order. I thank her and the radio turns to static again. A pale man comes over to my seat and sits next to me. We shake hands as if we have known each other for a really long time. But I have never ever seen this man before in my life. In fact, I’d like it if he stays far, far away from me.

“I don’t think you belong here.” He comes closer to me and whispers in my ear. Simultaneously, he is playing with the rings on his fingers. He has quite a few of them.

“I don’t?” I reply, taking another sip of my coffee. His breath stinks.

“You do not. Because you are just watching. Why? Watching isn’t living.” He says that with a grin on his face, and winks. As if he just shared a secret that I have been dying to know. What does he even mean by that?

Behind us, I see a couple kissing as maggots emerge from their eyes and eat away at their skin. Both of them scream in unison as green pus oozes out of them in place of blood. Their faces are changing rapidly and their voices are too. Their faces are changing so fast that it almost looks like static to me. Somehow, no one else seems to notice them.

The pale man is still gawking right at me. He is looking at me like he hasn’t seen another human being before. He is completely bald, and his skin is as smooth as a baby’s. He has huge bulging eyes and he still hasn’t gotten rid of the shit-eating grin from his face. He does not blink. An indescribable disgust emerges from the very pits of my gut.

“Why are you talking to me?” I ask him, my drink almost over. I am about to gag, retch and subsequently throw up all over him.

“Because you don’t belong here. Do you want to take a walk with me?” He says, his face curled into a frown now. And just like all those people on the street, his frown retracts quickly.

I somehow manage to stop myself from throwing up, and reply ‘No, thanks’. I get up from my seat and walk away from him. I pay for my coffee and the bill seems to dissolve right into my arms.

Context: I am nearing 30 year old eldest sister and I have 19 yr old sister na may boyfriend. She is a college student right now and in medical field school here in manila. So nag rent kami ng condo here in manila for my sister and my brother. So dalawa silang living and still at college. I would say ok lg yung pamumuhay namin hndi mayaman, hindi din mahirap. My mom has a business and my dad is a government employee. Ako naman is VA and earning 6-digits per month. Nag papa renovate ako ng bahay namin and nearing 1m na yung na gasta ko. yung mga tuition and allowance ng siblings ko mainly sa parents ko talaga nanggagaling but sometimes sakin din kinukuha if ma short minsan. But yung mga phones, ipads, gadgets nila ako yung nag bibigay. Hand downs lg naman lahat but still it has price no. yung mga vacation namin, coffee and merienda sa labas akin lahat yun. dinadala ko sila sa mga new place and mamamahal na place and I thought ina appreciate din yun nila. I mean, feeling ko naman appreciated din yun ng magulang ko and 2 brothers ko PERO etong sisteret ko talaga ni thank you sa binibigay ko wala. hindi din naman sya nag hingi pero kasi alam ko kailangan nya kaya binibigyan ko sya ng gadget like phone and ipad. Mataas naman grades nya pero yung ayaw ko talaga is lagi syang sumasama sa boypren nyang mayaman. And I feel na yung mga binibigay ko is eschepwera lg sa kanya kasi anytime pwedi din naman syang bilhan ng bf nya. Student silang dalawa pero spoiled sa family yung bf nya. Merong credit cards, palaging grab, palaging sa mall kakain. and sinasama nya din lagi yung sister ko. Mabait naman yung bf nya sa akin pero hndi pasya legal sa family namin. Hindi ko lg gusto kasi gusto kong maging marunong sa budgeting yung sister ko and gusto kong mag luto sya sa condo kesa kumain lagi sa mall kahit na libre ng bf nya. Am i over protective? Student palang sila and ganun na yung karangya lagi ang life nila. Medjo tanga tanga din sa buhay tong sister ko kaya nag woworry talaga ako baka kasi mabuntis na wala sa oras. yung mga Genz pa naman subong sobrang marurupok. You can't blame me. 

So ganito na nga, everytime na weekend nag uuwi kami lahat sa bahay namin outside manila. Then merong luto always si mama then yung sister ko na yan is ayaw lagi mag bond sa amin like hindi nya talaga gusto na nag hehelp sya samin sa kusina. Yung alibi nya always is may inaaral daw sya sa ipad pero kapag tinitignan ko naman, same page lg naman ng pdf yung inaaral nya umaga hanggang gabi?? in short, AYAW NYA LANG TALAGA MAG HELP sa amin mg prepare. and Lagi naman syang nasa kwarto at nag seselpon. kaya wala talaga syang time sa family nya kada weekend. Then kating kati talaga syang bumalik agad sa manila pra magkita naman ulit sila ng bf nya at para libre naman sa kung saang mamahaling restaurant. 

Previous Attempts: pinagsabihan ko nasya na wag na lumabas ng gabi after ng class nya pero simangot lg yung nakukuha ko. like talaga ba? if kunin ko kaya lahat ng binigay sayo? cp, ipad, shoes? etc. wala talagang good manners ampota. Parang kasalanan ko pa talaga na nag checheck ako ng condo nila. Sa condo naman, hndi rin nag titipid ng kuryente. May aircon na, may fan pa. grabe. 

Gusto ko talagang bigyan ng leksyong tong sister ko pero hndi ko alam kung paano. Sobrang maldita pa mag sagot sagot. Ayaw ko nlg din pumatol kasi baka ma saktan ko sya physically kasi nakakagigil na talaga minsan walang respeto pero kapang manghihingi ng pera or ano dyan ang bait bait ampota. 

Yung dalawang brother ko mabait din naman sa akin. Wala kaming issue. eto lang talagang sister ko ang hndi na makayanan. kahit si mama at papa ayaw din sa asal nya. FEELING NYA TALAGA NA KAYANG KAYA NYA NA WALA KAMI. Ganon talaga yung vibe sa amin. gusto kong kunin phone at ipad pero kasi binigay ko naman at saka ok din naman yung grades nya pero she is so distant sa amin. hindi ko na alam ang gagawin ko as an eldest sister. 

patulong naman po. Thanks

Hi, I’m currently flat-hunting and would love to find some like-minded people to move in with. I’ve already got a few options in mind that I can share, and we can see if we click as potential flatmates!

I’d prefer people closer to my age so we’ll likely have a few shared interests 🥹 I’m not just looking for a house of flatmates - I’d really love to make a home out of our place.

About me: 
- 22, chill, loves shows, anime, animals, and going out
- Non-smoker
- Enjoys get-togethers, eating out, and cooking (but only in a clean kitchen - this one’s non-negotiable 🥹). The good news: I’ll happily cook for you and bake lots of cakes!
- Not the type to always stay in my room. I’d love to hang out in shared spaces, work together, chat, and make the place feel lively and welcoming

If this sounds like your vibe, reach out and let’s grab a coffee to chat! 🫶

**Key Stats & Odds:**

* **New York Liberty**: The Liberty are a **-11-point favorite** (decimal odds: 1.15–1.18, implied probability: **85–87%**) despite playing on the road. Their +1.2 net rating over their last 10 games? Just a warm-up act for their playoff push.
* **Washington Mystics**: The Mystics are on a **8-game losing streak** and own a **-12.2 net rating** in their past 10. Their defense? A sieve so leaky, even the Liberty’s coach might use it as a coffee mug.
* **Totals Line**: 158.5 points (even odds for over/under). With the Mystics’ porous defense and the Liberty’s playoff urgency, this game might blow the roof off the building—literally.

1nbkeev,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1nbkeev/day_5/,Day 5,"I wrote a post last week saying I can’t quit. Well, I’m on day 5 of my 10th ish attempt to quit. I’ve tried to quit every month for a year… so maybe more than 10 attempts. 

This time has been markedly easier… I think for a few reasons… 

1. I’m so bored of saying I want to quit: why not just quit? 
2. All of my previous attempts have really prepared me for what happens when you first try. Now, I’m in a position where I feel a craving and know exactly what it feels like, how long it is likely to last and how to combat it. 
3. I feel psychically better for not vaping. In my previous attempts, I didn’t feel massively different - this time I’ve paid close attention to my physical state: sleep, energy levels, bowel movements (TMI but it’s important) and I can see positive changes already, even if they’re slight. 

My top tips would be: 

1. Don’t feel bad if you slip. Each attempt is genuinely one step closer to rewiring your brain. 
2. I use nicotine gum. I know some people prefer to avoid NRT. The attempts where I didn’t were physically painful. 
3. Breath. Breath work has massively helped me. It not only mimics the physical motion of breathing in a vape but it also helps to lower your blood pressure and regulate yourself when a craving hits. 
4. Sugar free fizzy drinks. These are amazing to tickle the back of your throat and create that tingle like when you hit a vape. 
5. Focus on the things that bring dopamine hits. Eat your favourite food, drink your favourite drinks and space these out throughout the day so you have things to ‘look forward to’. 
6. Talk to yourself in a positive way. The first thing I say to myself when I wake up is: ‘I am a happy non vaper and I’m going to have a good day.’ I also write down in my notes in my phone all of the good things I’ve experienced in a day, further reinforcing that happiness doesn’t come from vaping, it comes from my partner, my dog, food, friends, peaceful moments, tea, coffee, dancing. Shifting your focus over to ‘healthy’ dopamine hits helps to rewire your brain. 

I hope this time it will stick and I hope this advice helps someone. 🙏🏼",2,1757328423.0,QuitVaping,2,1.0,False

Carroll’s -110 line? It’s the sportsbook’s way of saying, “We’re not sure if he’ll be a slugger or a disappointment.” Either way, it’s a coin flip.

Expert Strategies for Bahrain Company Formation in 2025\
Personal Story: A Morning in Bahrain Bay\
It was a hot, bright Monday when I first sat down at the ground-floor branch of Costa Coffee in Bahrain Bay, feeling a bit nervous before my MOICT appointment in the Diplomatic Area. My smartphone buzzed — a reminder to bring six passport copies (a lesson learned the hard way). The lobby bustled with entrepreneurs: some dressed for high-level meetings in the Bahrain Financial Harbour, others looking like they’d just wrapped up an overnight sprint in Seef District’s vibrant shared workspaces. That morning, between sips of Arabic coffee and snippets of fast-paced business Arabic echoing behind me, I realized just how different Bahrain’s free zones really are — and how the right setup can make or break your company’s fortunes, especially if you want those exclusive industry perks.\
\
Alt text: Smartly dressed business professionals collaborating over documents in a modern office setting.)\
- Streamlined regulatory environment (official resources)\
Importantly, Bahrain’s government continues to invest in fintech, logistics, manufacturing, and clean energy clusters. The Economic Development Board (EDB) forecasts $2.6B in new FDI for 2025, with most going directly to free zones and sector-focused clusters.\
\
“Location, talent, and government support — these are why so many set up here instead of Dubai or Riyadh now,” said an executive I met during a majlis-style Tamkeen networking breakfast at The Westin City Centre.\

\
Understanding Bahrain Free Zones: Structure, Types & Strategic Advantages\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration: diverse professionals reviewing company structure diagrams in a high-rise office.)\
Major Bahrain Free Zones (2025 Update)\
\
Bahrain International Investment Park (BIIP): Manufactures, food processing, logistics. 100% foreign ownership, 0% corporate tax, 0% customs duties on raw imports.\
Bahrain Logistics Zone (BLZ): Logistics, shipping, regional warehousing. Fast-track customs, exclusive LMRA quotas.\
Bahrain FinTech Bay: For fintech and digital services companies. Dedicated regulatory sandbox, EDB-funded incentives.\
Bahrain Airport Free Zone: Aviation, e-commerce fulfillment, cold storage. Proximity to cargo facilities, reduced LMRA fees.\
Bahrain Bay & Financial Harbour: Corporate headquarters, consulting, investment firms. Grade-A office spaces, white-glove government services, direct MOICT liaisons.\
\
\
Tangent: I once helped a wellness startup choose between BIIP and Bahrain Bay for their HQ, and we discovered the real advantage wasn’t just incentives — it was the proximity to Seef’s gyms and business lunch scene, which helped them recruit top local talent. Sometimes, “soft” factors drive “hard” business outcomes.\
\
\
Are There Industry-Specific Free Zone Incentives in Bahrain?\
Absolutely. Bahrain’s free zones offer sector-targeted incentives designed to attract high-value businesses, especially in logistics, fintech, manufacturing, and clean energy.\
Key Industry-Specific Incentives (2025 Regulatory Update)\
1. Manufacturing & Industrial\
\
Customs Exemptions: BIIP companies pay 0% on imported raw materials and capital equipment.\
Utility Subsidies: From July 2025, BIIP offers 15% discounts on electricity for food processing and light-manufacturing tenants.\
R&D Grants: EDB and Tamkeen co-fund up to BHD 50,000 for technology upgrades.\
Fast-Track Permits: Sijilat portal “industrial express” lane — under 5 business days if all documents are complete.\
\
2. Logistics and Shipping\
\
Bespoke Warehousing: BLZ firms get priority access to modular, scalable warehousing at BHD 1.8-2.2 per m2 (2025 rates).\
Customs Green Lane: Exclusive electronic pre-clearance; literally saved me three hours per shipment in my first logistics venture.\
Reduced LMRA Fees: Special 10% decrease starting March 2025 for companies moving regional distribution HQs to BLZ.\
\
3. FinTech & ICT\
\
Regulatory Sandbox: Bahrain FinTech Bay startups can test products with MOICT/CBUAE oversight before full licensing.\
EDB Incentive Vouchers: Up to BHD 30,000 in rent subsidies for seed-stage ventures. (I once secured this for a blockchain startup — paperwork is tricky; see time-saving tips below!)\
Talent Quotas: Looser LMRA visa quotas for fintech engineers, plus 50% faster processing during Ramadan.\
\
4. Green & Clean Tech\
\
Carbon Offset Credits: New for 2025 — companies in BIIP and BLZ can receive annual carbon offset credits if meeting sustainability KPIs (tracked via Tamkeen).\
Soft Loans: BHD 100k+ green project loans at 2.5% interest via Bahrain Development Bank.\
Renewable Subsidies: Free solar rooftop install for qualifying manufacturers starting May 2025.\
\
5. Corporate & Professional Services\
\
Premium Locations: Bahrain Bay and Financial Harbour firms often receive expedited MOICT commercial registration and exclusive access to government partnership programs.\
Networking Access: Priority invites to EDB and Tamkeen business roundtables—an underestimated perk for gaining insider contacts.\
\
\
Tip: See the complete range of Bahrain Free Zone benefits and updates before deciding your sector and location.\

Step-by-Step Bahrain Free Zone Company Formation: Pro Tips for 2025\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: Professional team working on business application paperwork at office desks..\
- Insider Tip: Go during mid-morning (10:30-11:30am, outside Ramadan) — staff are most responsive and queues are lightest.\
2. Prepare Documentation\
\
Passport copies (x6, yes, really! Government loves multiples for every director.)\
Lease agreement for office/warehouse space.\
Feasibility/business plan with sector focus if seeking grants.\
\
Pro Shortcut: Pre-fill Sijilat portal forms online; print and bring hard copies, as offline signatures often speed up initial approval.\
3. Submit Application\
\
Online via Sijilat or at MOICT counters in Diplomatic Area.\
Request fast-track processing for manufacturing and tech projects — mention sector-incentive eligibility for prioritized handling.\
\
4. Receive & Activate Commercial Registration\
\
CR (Commercial Registration) issued within 3–7 working days for most free zone setups; sometimes under 48 hours if using an EDB-backed service provider.\
Activate CR at LMRA, apply for staff visas, set up bank accounts.\
\
Personal Aside: The first time I made the mistake of scheduling my CR pick-up on a Wednesday afternoon — not realizing the office would close early for a majlis. Always check local business hour shifts, especially during Ramadan.\
5. Apply for Sector-Specific Incentives\
\
Directly approach Tamkeen for grants, subsidies, or R&D vouchers.\
For FinTech Bay incentives, apply via EDB — bring a detailed product roadmap and financial model.\
\
6. Compliance & Renewals\
\
Keep all accounting records and submit quarterly reports for Tamkeen/EDB incentive tracking.\
Outsource routine bookkeeping (recommended partner) to avoid compliance headaches.\
\
\
Legal & Tax Compliance in Free Zones\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: Team reviews legal compliance documents and contracts..\
- VAT registration: Required if turnover exceeds BHD 37,500/year.\
- Sector audits: Some incentives require sector-compliance audits; Tamkeen often sends account managers for periodic site visits.\
Common Mistake: Entrepreneurs often forget to update their business activity code with Sijilat when pivoting (e.g., adding logistics to a manufacturing CR). This can invalidate sector-specific incentives. Always notify MOICT and update your CR.\
\
Support Services: Sponsorship, Accounting, and Beyond\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: Corporate consultant providing expert advice to startup founders. and regional networking for certain activities.\
- Accounting & Compliance: Outsourcing to a local firm saves major headaches — especially for quarterly incentive tracking.\
- Business Advice: Tamkeen and EDB offer free clinics. (During one, I met a mentor who helped me save BHD 2,000/year by switching my office lease to a Seef serviced suite.)\
Pro Tip: Join the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce; their WhatsApp alert groups share real-time updates on policy changes and grant cycles.\
\
Ownership Structures: Foreign Investors & 2025 Policy Update\
Surprisingly, Bahrain now allows 99%–100% foreign ownership for most commercial activities in free zones (see details). The new 2025 commercial laws (effective January 1st) eliminated the old “mandatory Bahraini partner” requirement for all but a few sensitive industries (e.g., oil, defense).\
\
LLC, SPC, and Branch options: Each has different requirements for documentation, minimum capital, and board structure (see structure comparison).\
No local sponsor required: Except for specialized sectors (education, media), as per MOICT guidance.\
\
Notably, this gives Bahrain a clear edge over UAE’s “mainland” restrictions and Saudi’s complex SAGIA licensing.\
\
Bahrain's Unique Business Customs: Bridging Tradition and Modernity\
Bahrain business culture is a blend of tradition and open-minded innovation. Expect:\
\
Majlis-style meetings: Shoes off, Arabic coffee and dates, open dialogue. It’s where real business gets done.\
Ramadan hours: Compressed, so schedule regulatory matters in the mornings.\
Follow-ups: Face-to-face or WhatsApp is preferred over emails for key government contacts.\
\
I once got my papers bumped to the top of the pile simply by bringing a small box of mamool and respecting the local coffee protocol at an MOICT desk in Seef. Small gestures, big impact.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Free Zone Industry Incentives & Company Formation\

The first two 1 on 1’s I touched a little bit on his performance and always going over on hours. This last one on one I was very blunt about his performance and things needed to get addressed now. I truly want him to succeed, have suggested ways to improve his performance and even setup bi-weekly meetings to touch base to make sure he is staying on track. I’m struggling with this situation, not because of how blunt I was, but because he doesn’t seem to have the same passion or drive as everyone else on the team. 
He is a great guy personally and I’m looking for guidance as to not struggle when someone on the team doesn’t seem to put in as much effort as the rest. How much hand holding should I be doing?

But the last year or so, neither relationship is really serving me & I’m struggling to figure out how to manage it gracefully & kindly.

She’s just not doing a great job on my hair anymore. I need it cut with lots of layers or my hair gets flat instead of wavy, how I like it. She cut it super blunt last time (in May), but I couldn’t really see it until I washed it again & it didn’t dry the way it normally does. The time before that she left some stringy parts at the front, which I had specially asked her not to do for after not liking that the time before. I used to take my son to her too, & I’d have to point out that the front was crooked, or I’d end up cleaning up around his ears myself (these issues were usually when my husband took him & doesn’t look as closely as I do). She always says we can come back if we’re not happy, but we don’t live close & life is hectic. So I’ve had someone else at a different salon cut & color my hair the last two times & I’ve been very happy.

I also cut back on how much I was engaging generally. On the friendship side, there’s a big age gap between us, so now we are in VERY different places in life. It’s fine in theory, but she’s just repeating the same gripes a lot, interrupts me a lot, it’s just not really enjoyable to converse. I started a new job a few months ago, & while I work in a pretty niche industry, I swear for being a “good” friend she couldn’t give you the faintest idea of what I do. She asks how it is or what the role is exactly, but then interrupts me halfway thru a sentence & we never really get far. It doesn’t at all have to be all about me, but it’s not a two way conversation most times, this is just one example. She also complains about money nearly incessantly, but doesn’t do anything to grow her business (she doesn’t want to “do that marketing stuff” at her age) & then jets off to Mexico for a week. She’s never been good with money, & I think I’m just tired of the same story (& subsequent trips to Mexico a couple of times a year) over & over.

So…I’ve been calling less frequently, just giving some distance, but she wants to hang out for coffee & I’m running out of excuses. I can manage a conversation & the things that annoy me for a couple of hours, that’s no problem, but I wear my hair cut at my chin, so there is zero hiding the fact that someone else has been cutting it for the last 4 months. What do I say when she asks? Do I pull the “need something closer to home” card? (It’s not really true, new place is a 20 minute drive instead of a 30 minute drive to her.)

Sweat beads lined the edge of my forehead as I struggled to keep my eyes fixated on the newspaper that shielded my eyes from the woman sitting across from me.

“It’s like you don’t love me anymore, darling. Did I do something wrong?’

Her leg shot up underneath the table, and her foot grazed my shin and right knee. I heard the water droplets drip down onto the floor as she rubbed her foot up and down against my leg.

“Pleaaseee, darling. Won’t you look at me?’ she begged

I sipped my coffee shakily and adjusted the newspaper in my hand. My heart thumped to the beat of a machine gun while my wife’s chipped and dirty nails clicked and clacked atop our dining room table. You see, it’s not that I didn’t want to see her; I loved my wife with all of my heart and soul. She was my rock, my support beam, and I’d give anything to have her back. Well, the real her. Because the person sitting before me today was not my wife.

My wife was an angel. An illuminating light in my world of darkness. What happened to her was tragic and completely unjust, but it was also my fault. I was the reason behind her accident, the reason why she put on her stunning wedding gown one last time before throwing herself off the highest bridge in our city, and plummeting to her death in the watery grave below.

We argued, and I said some things I didn’t mean; dear God, I want to take them back, but I can’t. I’m stuck, I’m imprisoned here with this, this, imposter. This sacrilegious thing that has taken the place of my wife. I was drunk and I told her I didn’t think she was attractive, and I’m sorry, okay?! I’m sorry for what I’ve done. She knows I thought she was beautiful, I know she knows it, she has to know, right?

“Donavinnnnn..you’re still not looking at meee,”

I was at my breaking point, and tears began to sting my eyes. Her cold, grey hand reached over and caressed the edge of my newspaper, leaving dark, wet streaks running down the length of it. She ran her hand across the top back and forth, and eventually the paper grew soggy and damp in my hands. The corners began to fold in, and my wife’s decaying face started forcing its way into view.

With one flick of her broken wrist, she pushed the paper, and the whole thing slumped over in my arms.

Maggots ate away at her face, and gaping black wounds etched the sides of her neck. Her eye sockets were completely black and hollow, but the worst part of all was her mouth. Her jaw was dislocated, yet her words came out so fluently, filling the room with the stench of rotting meat each time she spoke.

“Aren’t I pretty, Donavin? Don’t you love me?”

Her pouts grew into sobs, which eventually mutated into distorted wails. Ear-splitting screams that only I could hear.

She’s still wearing her beautiful wedding dress, the silky white now coated with mucus and mud.

I’ve had my Breville Barista Express for four months, but I haven't used it in the last two months. I usually got consistent shots—about 18g of beans yielding a double shot in \~30 seconds, perfect pressure, not bad crema for the first 2 months. However, I took a break from espresso for 2 months because my parents bought a large quantity of instant coffee, and I stuck with that.

Yesterday, I tried making espresso again, and it was a disaster. The coffee looked really dark, under-extracted, had almost no pressure, and tasted worse than instant. I used the same beans I always use. I also recently started dosing manually.

https://preview.redd.it/v1g54ozj6xnf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8584ab169c8b85e5a758f137efdbb385c817c81

Here’s my process now:

1. Turn on the coffee machine
2. Check if there is enough water
3. Flush/ rinse the machine
4. Put in a shot basket in the portafilter
5. Measure 18g of beans
6. Grind the beans
7. Tamp (I don't have a WDT :( )
8. Clean the edges
9. Lock it in and pull the shot

Yesterday, the shot weighed 86g in total :o

The yield is way too high, but I’m not sure if grind size, tamping, or something else is also a factor. I can't remember changing anything, so if I miss a step, let me know. This post was removed from [r/coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee/), so hopefully y'all can help!

We as a human species have reached a point in our timeline where every ounce of our day could be consumed by the small computer that we each conceal in our pockets. I’m no different than anyone else; I, too, have succumbed to this trap on multiple occasions, too many to even count.

But there’s something evil within these apps. I don’t know what it is or how it works. Hell, this may be a demon designated to me alone. Or an AI, who knows at this point? All I know is the other night, I was lying in bed after a long day’s work, trying to unwind and scroll some reels. Everything was normal for the first hour or so; the usual car accidents, shitposts, and memes. However, as I fell deeper into the doomscrolling, I came across a video that just showed…me..? Sitting at the dinner table with my brother and parents. The table was set beautifully, and my mother had prepared a nice meal of what seemed to be meatloaf, a meal she had never cooked before.

I was completely stunned. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, and the video went on for 10 straight minutes, just showing us as we ate quietly. Once every plate was cleaned, and we all started to get up to walk away, the video restarted back to the beginning. I rushed to my parents’ room to show them what I’d found, but by the time I got there, the feed had refreshed entirely.

I mean, how do you even explain that to someone, “hey, I just saw us eating dinner on Instagram, that’s probably something to look out for,” like what? No. Luckily, though, I had remembered the username. I typed user.44603380 into the Instagram search bar, and only one account popped up. When I clicked on it, I was baffled to find that there were no posts made at all, just a blank page. However, there was one clear sign of evidence that I was looking in the right place: the profile picture. See, this account had zero followers, zero following, and everything about the page looked grey and new. Everything except for the profile picture, which was me, yet again, staring into the camera for a photo I did not take. My face was soulless and hollow. Barely maintaining the essence of a human.

This was clear evidence, though, and I ran to show my parents again. I was profoundly disappointed when both my mom and dad insisted that it had to be one of my friends playing some kind of prank on me. I don’t know why I expected either of them to understand. I mean, they’re parents, what do they know about social media? Nevertheless, I reported the account for pretending to be someone else, and by the next morning, it had been taken down. Relieved, I went to work with warmth in my chest.

When I got home, I repeated the process. Kicked my shoes off, plopped down on the bed, and began scrolling. This time, a good quarter of what I saw was me, posted from different, all-new accounts. None of the videos were actually me; they all captured me doing things that I had never once done. Walking a dog I never had, browsing at a library I’d never seen before, all taken from obscure angles like the person behind the camera was hiding.

Thoroughly creeped out, I reported every single page I came across. It totaled up to something like 30 different accounts, all dedicated to me, and I got the notification when each one had been taken down. I decided to take a break from the reels after that, putting my phone away in a drawer and going outside for some fresh air. I actually didn’t even pick up my phone again until it was time for work the next day.

When I did, a notification was displayed across the screen. I had been informed that my Instagram account had been taken down for “pretending to be someone else.” I didn’t know what to do, so I sent an appeal to Instagram and just went to work, albeit a little on edge. When I got off, I was astounded to find that my appeal had been rejected and that it would take 30 days before I could launch a new one.

Whatever, right, but I had a real problem going on, I couldn’t just not watch as it unfolded. I set up a basic new account and started scrolling. It didn’t take long before I found myself again. Getting coffee, stopping off for gas, interacting with people I’d never met. Eventually, that’s all that my new page consisted of: just videos of me every time I scrolled. There were now too many accounts to report all with that same random string of numbers username.

As I scrolled, the videos changed. I was no longer out doing the mundane. I was now walking down the road in every video. Walking down a road that I recognized as the one just before my actual neighborhood. Then it was in my driveway, then at my doorstep, then, as if nothing happened, back to the regular Instagram feed. Puppies, nature, advertisements. All the accounts were gone. All the videos were gone. And I felt like I was going crazy.

I tossed my phone to the side and just lay in my bed, staring up at the ceiling. I drifted off into deep thought, which eventually turned into sleep. When I awoke, I went through my normal process: getting dressed, making the bed, you know the deal. When I checked my phone, I stood utterly horrified as hundreds of videos showed up, all with thousands of views, all showing the third-person perspective of me murdering my parents.

I basically exploded out of my bedroom door to find the walls coated in blood, so much so that it appeared the walls were leaking with the crimson liquid. The smell of iron radiated throughout the entire house, and when I entered my parents’ bedroom, I found them sprawled across the bed, stab wounds decorating their bare torsos. Instagram still pulled up on my device, I heard as police sirens came flooding in through the phone’s speakers.

When I raised the screen to my face, I saw myself, standing over my parents’ bed, cellphone in hand. A mixture of confusion, desperation, and terror plastered across my face. That’s when the room began to flash red and blue as police lights came pouring in through the bedroom windows. A loud pounding came from the front door before it flew open and splintered as an armed SWAT unit came rushing in, rifles trained on me. They pinned me to the floor and my phone went flying from my hand, bouncing across the floor and landing propped up against the wall.

The last thing I saw on the feed was me being handcuffed before it refreshed back to the kittens and baking recipes. I was brought in for questioning, and my lawyer insisted I plead insanity.

I’m going on an Australia Carnival cruise soon (my first cruise) and I’m trying to work out my drink budget or if the (non-alcoholic) drink package is worth it.

So I was wondering if anyone remembers how much drinks cost on board. I’m mainly interested in

* Barista coffees (lattes, cappuccinos, iced coffee)
* Milkshakes
* Smoothies
* Mocktails
* Sodas

But if you also remember roughly how much alcoholic drinks cost, I’d love to know too:

* Spirit-based drinks (vodka, rum, gin + mixers)
* Cocktails (just a rough idea)

If anyone has a recent menu or remembers rough prices from their Carnival cruise, I’d really appreciate it - it’ll help me plan my budget and decide whether to get the package or not.",0,1757327479.0,Cruise,1,0.5,False

I read every reply and each one gave me more confidence and motivation to go back. I went to my local speaker meeting with my partner that has 3 years but hasn't been in the rooms for a while.

We both heard what we needed to, I got some new numbers and saw some old faces. When I was asked by one of my favorite old timers if I had gone out, I was honest, and he made no big fuss about it, just said sometimes it doesn't stick one the first or even fourth try, and he was happy to see me back and hoped I kept coming.

I plan to keep going to this speaker meeting every week, whether my partner wants to come or not, and get my sea legs back before going to the bigger and more interactive meetings.

AA is the only place where I feel like I can sit still for an hour and just listen (even if I've had a cup of the strongest darkest coffee I've ever seen). I'd really forgotten what I'd given up by retreating out of shame.

Thank you guys for being a huge component of the ""attraction rather than promotion"" and helping to give me the nudge I needed to shut the voices in my head up and just go. ",8,1757327349.0,alcoholicsanonymous,1,0.91,False

On the day that it happened we met up for coffee and talked through the whole thing and agreed to keep in touch, but I am extremely socially inept and am struggling with knowing what to say. They are dealing with bad mental health and addiction (the reason they were fired), and I want to check in and ask how things are going, but whenever I open the message app I just end up blankly staring at it and then closing it again in frustration when no words come to mind. 

“Hey how’s it going?” Seems like an obvious choice, but feels kinda jarring and vague, especially out of nowhere. Am I overthinking this or is there a better way to approach the conversation?

Also, this is kind of selfish, but I’m also running on a really low social battery and really don’t want to give the impression that I’m looking to meet up today, but I do still want to reach out as it’s been like a week since we spoke and I am worried about them. Like, if they reply and say that they need help or that *they* specifically want to meet up then yes I will drop everything to be there, but I’m also just kind of exhausted, yknow?

(Small cafeteria sounds, there are few other people)

Excuse me... I'm sorry, I don't want to impose myself, but I've heard you speak with the barista and I'm almost sure you are a regular here.

I knew it! I have a small problem. Uhmmm... How to say it... I looked at the menu and... I'm absolutely and totally lost. There is just too much to choose from. And I'm here for the first and maybe the last time and I don't want to end up ordering black coffee just because I panicked.

Yeah, I know I could just ask him, but I don't really trust sellers of any kind. I always feel like they would sell me first thing that comes to their mind, or something that doesn't sell well and they left with too much supplies, or something that's just easy to make... Do you get me? And you look kind of trustworthy. I mean - you don't want to sell me anything, you would just help me out of your pure hart.

Wonderful! So - first question: what is this place most famous of?

Oh really? Is it something common in this region?

No, it's my first time here and to be honest - I'm just passing through. Somehow this part of the country didn't sound interesting, so I know nothing about regional customs. But it sounds like something worth trying. So, the second question: what is the weirdest thing you can drink here?

Oh, how disappointing. Kind of lame... Not really that weird, I've drink weirder coffee.

Like mushroom coffee. Sound disgusting, but it's not that bad. Or coffee with raw eggs - I wouldn't recommend that. And there was that one I really don't want to remember: coffee made of water used earlier to boil a sausage... Don't ask and don't drink under any circumstances.

Yep... But - the last question: what's your personal favourite?

Wouldn't guess that. Is it your regular choice or is it something for special occasions?

Ok, so I think I will choose between regional speciality or your favourite. The ""weird"" one is kind of insulting for a gourmet like me. Just one more question: can I join you? I knew I said I don't want to impose myself, but I've just spent few hours in a car alone and I would really appreciate someone to talk to.

Thank you so much, you can't imagine how happy you made me. I'll be back in a moment.

(Longer pause, speaker buys a coffee, than return to the table)

Yeah, I picked your favourite. Just thought it would be fun to compare our tastes.

(Speaker drinks)

Ouch, too hot. But actually rather nice. Tasty, but not in an obvious way. It has that weird flavour in the back, what is that?

Oh, I wouldn't guess. Either way - good choice. So... Do you live here?

Whole life? Pardon my astonishment, as far as I've seen it's rather charming town, but it seems kinda... sleepy. There is almost no people in the streets, even here the place is almost empty and I would assume this is their rush hours. Is there even something going on here?

And you never wanted to try the big city life?

It's hard to believe... I would probably die of a boredom here. Are there any interesting places in here? Tourist attractions?

What could be interesting in an old hospital?

Really? Urban explorers are the only tourist here? Wow, unbelievable... Maybe you have some famous citizens or former citizens?

Who's that?

An influencer... Please, give me a break... So what are you doing here to don't go mad?

Your job is interesting?

I'm sorry, but this sounds extremely... dull. Like you don't get the best of life: thrill, emotions... Like, you know, things that make you feel alive.

This sounded like an eighty year old pensioner and you look at least few years younger.

I live in the capital. You just can't get enough of it, there's always so much going on. The speed, the noise, the chaos... It's like the essence of life. All the important events are there, the future of the world is decided there. You meet VIPs on the streets. You never know what will happen, every day is an adventure.

You just say that because you never tried. Visiting for a few days will give you only a headache, but after a few weeks you become fluent and addicted. 

Come on, pass me your phone, I will give you my number and if you ever feel like this town is slowly killing you, you are more than welcome to visit me. I will show you some interesting places. I will show you what it means to be alive.

(This is the moment where there should be a hearable change in the voice. First part should be rather loud and friendly, and the second quieter, with a lower and calmer voice)

Ok, so... I have to confess something. I'm here for the specific reason. I came all that way just to meet you. 

No, the phone stays with me. Let's turn it off... Done. 

Shhhhh... You don't want to put all this people in danger, don't you? So just calm down and listen very carefully. I know who you are. And I know you didn't recognise me, I can see it in your eyes. But don't worry, you'll get it in a moment. You weren't perfectly honest with me, we're you? This town has one very famous former citizen, what we both know, because it happens to be our mutual friend. But maybe ""friend"" isn't the best word in my case.

Oh, you know who I have in mind. That one who doesn't show his face. That one you gather information for.

I will give you a good advice: don't take me for a fool and don't serve me that bullshit. But I must say I was really impressed, when I found that most of my opponent's victories are in a half or more a merit of their childhood friend, who still lives in their hometown and work from the shadows. Perfectly safe. Isn't that what you both were thinking? And now - surprise!

Keep calm or I will keep you calm. You know I can do it. Want a sample of my abilities? Can you feel that tingling in your spine going higher and higher? Now watch this.

(In that moment listener experience a short burst of pain, I think it can be signalised by a sound, like ringing in the ears or something)

There, there, it's over. It's ok now, breathe. But I can make it much worse. Did he tell you I can do things like that? 

I bet he didn't. I think you are not aware of a half  that is going on there. You live here peacefully, working just with your phone and laptop, away from the center of the storm. Like a remote hero. And he would be nothing without you. He is just a moron who can't even keep his identity in secret from his enemies. Do you know how much danger he puts you in?

Your decision? Have you ever been in a battle? Have you ever seen him live in action? Not on the TV, perfectly filtered and narrated in the only right way. Have you ever questioned his decision or methods? Maybe he isn't that much of a hero you think he is?

Shhhhh... We will get back to this. Now finish your coffee, stand up, take your stuff, smile at the barista and wave him goodbye, just like you always do. We're leaving. And remember: if you'll try anything, I'm gonna make it hurt.

(Steps, opening and closing the door, sounds of the small town)

There is my car. I must admit I didn't expect you'll be so obedient. It looks like you're smarter than I thought. Be my guest.

(Sounds of opening the door of a car, speaker and listener get in, doors are closed and the city sounds become muffled)

But from the other side - you really disappointed me. I was counting on a bit of fun. Some hysteria, a bit of blood, small carnage... And it all went so quick and clean... I'm not used to actions ending like this. I feel kind of... hungry. Dissatisfied. You know what I mean? 

Silent treatment? Ok, your choice. Will you fasten the seatbelt by yourself or do I have to do it?

(Listener fastens the seatbelt, speaker do the same with their)

You see - that's what I've been talking about. You're so good at being obedient. Is it my charm or are you handling the pain really bad? Or maybe, you know... Maybe that's your kink?

Oh, don't look at me like this, I was joking. Or maybe I wasn't... You like to be the submissive one?

(Laughs)

Hahaha, we're gonna have so much fun together!

Isn't it obvious? We're going to the capital, to my place. There we decide what to do next. I won't hide that it depends a lot on your behaviour. For now,  you're doing rather good. Maybe you could be a little more enthusiastic…

(Laughs)

Hahaha, I already love that look on your face! 

We need to check your apartment first, we will leave your phone there, you don't need it anymore. Do you want me to grab something important? Medicines? Clothes? Books?

No, you're not going with me, we don't have time for that. Either way, there's a long road before us and you definitely need a rest. Look into my eyes.

Look into my eyes or I will make you do it.

(With a soft, calming voice)

That's better.

Can you feel it? Isn't it a pleasant feeling? Your whole body relaxing, eyes slowly closing... You are lighter than a feather. And the world is far, far away... And it is gone…

1nbk1y4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbk1y4,"How about this as a pantry, instead of a walk-in? 1890s cottage progress","
Hi Team,

We have a tricky space as a kitchen as there’s a fireplace in the middle of one wall - which we have an oven& gas stove within- so our layout is restricted around this. We were trying to fit a table in the kitchen while also having ample space for prep (we cook & bake a lot!).

Room between the kitchen cabinets is 1.1m wide and between end of peninsula & cooktop about 1.2m so our walkways are good.

To the left of the fireplace(box shape in photos) is where we want our pantry. It’s 960mm wide & It’s only two of us in the house so I thought it’s best if it has a bench as a landing zone but also for using our small appliances such as rice cooker, air fryer and perhaps even coffee machine & grinder permanently there. Storage on top and in drawers for flour, sugar, tins etc etc.

The open design, as in not a walk-in pantry, in my opinion allows ample light and makes the awkward small space very usable and practical. Plus it will hide away all the clutter from view from living room and the main kitchen benches remain more empty & clean.

After some criticism about our design.

It’s not the most common and “instagram-worthy” we know, because it looks “busy” and because of that gap to the right of dishwasher.

We’re more interested in long term practicality.
