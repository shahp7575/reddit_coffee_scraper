Yesterday, after grabbing coffee, the bike wouldn’t start. I checked the fuses and eventually got it running after about 30 minutes of turning the key on and off multiple times.

This morning it wouldn’t start again. I’ve cleaned the starter relay, and it has a brand new battery, iridium spark plugs, and a new air filter.

I wanted to post a photo of my whisky group and our line up and I really hope that some more of you do the same. (If that's even something I can even do with this post, I don't post often, except for replys).

Don't worry too much, this wasn't an ""afternoon meetup"" we were pouring .5 to .75 Oz pours, for roughly 12 hours while constantly eating and drinking water. It took a while but we ran the gauntlet. (23 total this year)

Since I believe this will be deleted without a review, I will say out of our lineup of:

5 - Wee Beastie 
8 - For Discussion 
10 - Ten
An Oa 
Uigeadail 
Corryvreckan 
Arrrrrrrdbeg 
Fermutation 
Anthology ""Harpy"" 13yr 
Anthology ""Unicorn"" 14yr 
17 - The Legend Returns 
Traigh bhan batch 2 (Ardbeg Infinity)
Traigh bhan batch 5
Ardcore
Ardcore C.R.
Heavy Vapors
Heavy Vapors C.R.
Anamorphic
Hypernova 
Bizarrebq 
Ardbeg Spectacular 
Eureka 
Smokiverse 

- Between the five of us, 4 out of 5 agreed that Eureka was the clear winner. 

The Eureka didnt win overall just because it was new to us; as the Smokiverse, Traigh Bhan batch 5, as well as the 8 For Discussion were also new, but because it's coffee/toffee/chocolate notes are very forward and delicious. Overall it just presented a significantly different palate than most of the other Ardbegs and therefore really stood out. I would very much recommend picking this up if you can find one for MSRP. 

The Fermutation was a solid second, for 3 out of 5 of us.

Two other honorable mentions were the 14 ""Unicorn"" and the 8 ""For Discussion"" with one person's #1 pick being the Traigh Bhan batch 5.

The weakest of the pack, beyond the shadow of a doubt were the Ardcore and the Ardcore C.R. These were and always will be: duds/cash grabs in my mind. A whole a lot of people will claim that quite a few of the other Committee releases are the same. However I will say that I (we) enjoy them and that's all that matters. 

For clarification: The Traigh Bhan batch #2 is now an Ardbeg Infinity bottle. We started it last year and now use it for the bottles that die out every year. Only two bottles actually died this year (Bizarrebq and Arrrrrrrdbeg) but the short pour out of both of them, will live on, in the infinity.

...so what did you do for Ardbeg day this year? Post some pics and tell me all about your favorite out of your line up!

I used to swear by Espressions — hands down the BEST roaster in the city - IMHO.  You can find them at AJ's and other spots. They stopped doing French Roast.

I’m looking for a local Phoenix coffee roaster who can deliver a proper \*\*dark French Roast\*\* in a \*\*5lb bag\*\*. No shortcuts, no substitutions, no twists, just the real deal: deep, smoky, oily, bold. I don't want to continue to decode names whilst searching for good coffee.

I've tried cringeworthy cups with cute names like  

Midnight Ember, 
Volcanic Nocturne, 
Windsor Frog, 
Obsidian Reverie, 
Shadow Bloom, 
Lunar Burn, 
Advanced Robusta Sensory Experience (ARSE), 
Roast of The Ancients
 
I was very upfront with what I needed. At one spot, I got hit with the gaslight: \*“Oh, it’s still the same Dark French Roast we've always had just re-branded. We changed the name to Bambi's Breakfast Blaster (name changed to protect the clueless) that's all. Oh and we changed the roasting time and final colour, and the flavour was improved. Um, it looks like a Golden Blond Roast, but trust me it pours like a Dark French Roast""\*

Really?? That’s like ordering a Guinness and getting a Zima. I don’t like being treated like I can’t tell the difference. I \*can\*, and it’s not even close.

I'm willing to drive a bit in the Phoenix area and I prefer to support local small businesses. I'm sure there are other coffee snobs out there so give me your recommendations.

1l0yd7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0yd7b/am_i_pressuring_her_or_just_stating_boundaries/,Am I pressuring her or just stating boundaries ?,"I (M31) have been dating a woman (F24) for a couple of weeks. We had been eyeing each other for a few months—she was actually the one who initiated all the small talk at the coffee shop where she works. At the time, though, I was in a relationship that was on the verge of ending.

About a month after my breakup, I asked her out. Since then, we've spent almost all our time together. I’m pretty old-school, so after about three weeks of dating, I asked her if she wanted to be in a relationship. She said yes.

Since I’m an anxious person and currently eight months into therapy, I was upfront with her about my fear of possibly pressuring her. She reassured me, saying she didn’t feel pressured at all and that she wouldn’t have said yes if she didn’t feel the same way.

A few days later, she had her final university exam. I noticed she began to withdraw a bit, which I respected—it was obviously a demanding time for her. The next day, she had to attend a festival for work, where she was working as a barista and vendor. She gave me a ticket, so I went on Friday just to support her and be present. Even though she enjoys her work, it’s draining for her as an introvert who has to pretend to be extroverted for sales. We had some light conversations, and she told me she was really happy I came and appreciated that I was helping calm her nerves.

On Saturday, I went again with a few friends. We stayed a couple of hours. She tried to find me during her breaks so we could spend a little time together. But emotionally, she seemed shut down. Most of the conversation was just her venting her frustration and saying how much she wanted to go home. I stayed quiet and listened.

The next day (today), she traveled to visit her mom and family for a few days. Our chats were cold, and she left me on read most of the weekend—which I understood, given how emotionally drained she was from work and socializing. I tried to respect her space.

Later in the evening, though, I messaged her. I told her that even though I’m doing my best to give her space and be respectful, I felt insecure. What bothered me was that she never directly said she needed space. I said I would be totally fine if she just told me she needed some time for herself and reassured me that she still cares and will reconnect when she feels better. But the silence, the short answers, and being left on read for hours made me feel like I was getting breadcrumbs. I asked if she could offer a bit of reassurance—just to let me know she still wants to be with me—or at least give me clarity if she’d rather not be bothered by me at all. In hindsight, I know I was coming from an anxious place.

She responded by saying that on one hand, she understood and was sorry, but on the other hand, we had spent lot of time together, before she went to the festival, and now she was with her family. She then asked how often I need reassurance, because in her life, it’s not going to be a priority—at least not right now.

I replied by saying that we had agreed relationships are about showing we care. And while I’ve always felt like she did care, these past few days felt like a switch flipped. I told her all I’m asking for is something small—like a quick message about her day or a text saying she’ll contact me soon. Just like when she asked me to text her when I got home. That tiny effort—five seconds—is enough to make me feel safe and able to give her the space she needs. I’m simply asking for compromise.

She said she understood the frustration, but that she was also stunned by it. Then, in a passive-aggressive way, she asked if it would be okay for her to go to bed because she’s been feeling terrible and had a fever all day. Which I did not know about.

  
So now I'm wondering: Am I being “too much, too soon,” just an anxious guy who needs to chill? Or was this a healthy way of trying to communicate my needs, establish boundaries, and ask for compromise?|

  
\*\*TL;DR\*\*: I (M31) started dating a woman (F24) a few weeks ago after months of mutual interest. Things moved quickly, and I asked her to be in a relationship after three weeks—she said yes. Recently, she became distant due to stress from finals, work, and visiting family, and our communication dropped. I expressed that I’m okay with her needing space, but I’d appreciate small reassurances instead of feeling ignored. She said reassurance won’t be a priority right now, and now I’m unsure if I came off as too anxious or was just setting healthy boundaries.",0,1748808145.0,relationships,3,0.5,False

1l0ycas,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l0ycas/aitah_for_breaking_up_with_my_partner_after_years/,AITAH for breaking up with my partner after years of being emotionally ignored and sex-starved?,"I ended my 3-year relationship recently, and now I’m second-guessing my decision. My partner and I have been emotionally distant for a while, but it wasn’t until sex completely disappeared that I realized how deeply broken our relationship really was.

At first, I thought it was just a rough patch. I kept trying, still showing her love in small ways leaving little notes in her lunch bag, folding her sweaters, saying “goodnight” even though she’d never answer. It didn’t even matter how much I tried, though, because over time, I felt like a ghost in my own home. She stopped initiating affection altogether. No hugs, no kisses, no touching, nothing. And when I say “disappeared,” I mean that in the most literal sense. It was like I was invisible.

I’m working a 14-hour job, trying to keep everything together and keep the bills paid. I’m exhausted, but I still come home and try to give her some of my energy energy I don’t have. Yet, I was met with cold indifference. I gave what little I had left, but instead of feeling connected, I felt rejected.

Sex was never just about the physical act for me. It was the way I showed her that we were still us. Growing up in a home where love was never shown through affection, intimacy became my way of saying: “I love you. We’re still connected.” But instead, I was met with cold silence and emotional avoidance. And when I tried to reach out for even a hug or a kiss, it felt like I was being rejected by someone who didn’t even care enough to notice.

The most telling moment came one morning when I brought her breakfast in bed. Just toast, coffee, and a few apple slices nothing extravagant. I reached out to gently touch her arm to wake her, and she pulled away like I was some kind of stranger. My stomach dropped. I was crushed. I tried talking to her about it, about how I was feeling ignored and undesired, and her response? “You’re too sensitive,” she told me. “Stop pressuring me.”

She was the one treating me like an inconvenience, yet somehow I was the problem? That was when I realized I’d been nothing more than an afterthought to her. She was so emotionally avoidant, it was like my feelings didn’t even matter. And every time I tried to make myself heard, she either brushed me off or accused me of being too much.

I stopped talking. I stopped asking. I stopped existing. I became a shell of myself. Months went by where I didn’t feel wanted at all physically, emotionally, mentally. Nothing. Just silence.

I ended things, finally. I couldn’t keep drowning in her apathy. And when I broke up with her, it wasn’t just about the relationship anymore. It was about grieving the person I had become someone who kept making excuses, kept waiting for her to finally care. But she never did.

Now she’s asking me to come back, claiming she wants to try again. And honestly? I’m terrified. Terrified of going back to the same cold, heartless treatment. I’m terrified I’ll just disappear again, like I was never even there.

And I’m left wondering… if im the bad guy for walking away from a relationship where I was emotionally starved and constantly made to feel like a burden? Did I give up too easily, or is it okay to leave when you’ve been ignored, rejected, and emotionally neglected for so long?

The thing is, these tics went away as I became a teenager. I remained what I believe was tic free for a number of years. 

It was only after developing PTSD at 18 that my tics came back. I suddenly found myself compulsively shaking my head, flaring my nostrils, breathing out hard, etc. 

I now (at 26) deal with rapid blinking, lip movements, tongue darting, etc. 

These get worse under stress/anxiety, and especially around environmental trauma triggers. 

I'm currently on a stimulant ADHD and drink a lot of coffee. These factors may make my tics worse. 

Based on this information, would you say that I have tourettes, or a ""functional"" tic disorder? 

I'm not asking for a medical diagnosis, just layman opinions and perspectives. 

I don't have the money to afford to see a neurologist, so that's currently off of the table. 

I do, however, have access to meds (legally). I know that the source of your tics changes what treatment you may respond to.

I think I'm cursed,"Honestly, my bad luck in dating is almost comical at this point. I'm self-aware enough to know that if I keep striking out, look at the common denominator so I even took some time out after my last relationship ended to look at my patterns (conflict resolution was definitely something that needed working on).

I tentatively rejoined the dating scene and whether it's people I've meet IRL or via OLD, here is what I've experienced in the past 6mos:

1. Bump into a friend I've known since our teen years randomly for the first time in years. He'd asked me out a few times over the years but either I'd always been in relationships or he had. So I think ""maybe now's our time"". I message him and he shoots me down saying he's not a back up and then blocks me, even though there were other times when we spoke and he was in relationship and we didn't entertain it further, but still ended convo on a positive note.
2. Matched with a guy online. Spoke for a week or so. Both keen to hangout but he kept trying to meet last minute which I decline as I'm genuinely busy. Some internet sleuthing (we'd exchanged IGs at this point) later revealed he got back with his gf like a week later.
3. Matched with a guy online, seems promising. My response-times slow down as I get busy with life and I'm about to go on vacation. We agree to meet upon return. I follow up when I'm back and get ghosted. Even though we never connected on IG, I've caught him watching my stories.
4. Meet a guy at a library coffee-shop. The guy gives off chill, laidback and interesting vibes. I can tell he's younger but figure it's worth hanging out and giving it a chance. We exchange IGs and arrange to check out an art gallery a few days later. Chemistry and banter is definitely there. We establish the age-gap and it doesn't phase him. The date is quite short and I don't extend it because I had a throat operation recently and I'm still building my appetite back up. He asks me if I want to hangout again and I enthusiastically agree and tell him to also keep me updated about any upcoming gigs (he's a musician) of his. Usually I text a post-date msg but I can tell he's not the texting type. A few hours later I find he's unfollowed me.

I know rejection is redirection but I'm human and it's really starting to make me feel hopeless that not a single situation is working out, especially as I'm in my mid-30s and already feel judged for being single/childless. I can't help but wonder if it's something I'm doing wrong, like maybe I'm not showing enough interest? But prior to this recent spurt of bad luck, I've never had this issue before with this dating strategy.

I'm definitely more of a slow-burner with relationships advancing (I've done the whole 0-100 relationships and they just end up crashing and burning). At the same time, I know I definitely give off signals but it's just at a pace I'm comfortable with and I can't force",0,1748807888.0,ForeverAlone,0,0.5,False

I work in a café/bakery, we sell bread, rolls, cake as well as serve breakfast and lunch. The bakery is located in a supermarket so doors open as soon as the supermarket workers come in at 5am. We open at 8am, but my shift starts at 5:30am, we bake most products in the bakery so we need every minute to prepare before opening. Normally one person works alone from 5:30 to 8 (a second server comes in at 8), but on Saturdays we do the early morning with two servants, because we bake more on Saturdays. 

So last Saturday my coworker and I were baking together as usual when at 6:45am a customer came in the building. We were in the back room baking and yapping about the upcoming day, when the customer yelled ""Hey, hello, why am I not getting served here?"" My colleague went out and explained we are not actually opened yet, but we are legally required to serve customers any time. So she prepared his order, a breakfast set with scrambeled egg, rolls and some other things. It was all going well until the guy asked for coffee but we hadn't turned on the coffee machine yet. He screamed at my coworker, got furious why the bakery isn't fully stocked one hour before opening. In the end he waited until the coffee machine was turned on and ready to go while staring at us with an angry face. He didn't thank us or tip us or anything, just ate and left while making passive aggressive comments about our terrible terrible working attitude. Because of him we lost a lot of precious time and were running behind on baking for hours.

Overall yes I know I chose my job myself and it is my job to serve people but... please just come in during the opening times, not before, not after, it is not that hard🙏",10,1748807851.0,TalesFromYourServer,9,0.86,False

So, I’m not here to drop a “hey wyd” and vanish after 3 texts—I’m actually looking for a real long-term connection. Something easy, genuine, fun, maybe even deep sometimes. Y’know… something that feels good to come back to after a long day.

I’m 19. Into classic movies (yes, I love The Good, The Bad and The Ugly), emotional story games that destroy you in the best way, writing poetry and short stories when I get in my head a little too much.
Also big on books, learning languages (currently on Japanese and German), and just exploring new cultures in general.

I’m more of a mountain-and-coffee than club-and-shot type of guy. Solo travel? Big yes. Quiet sunrises? Even bigger yes.
Work-wise, life’s kinda wild—I run a marketing agency, work with an American company, and manage an NGO and school for kids who deserve better. So yeah, my schedule is chaotic—but I’m passionate about it.

What I’m looking for:
A long-term friend. Someone I can talk to regularly. Could be about deep life stuff or stupid memes. Could be voice notes at 2am or random “you gotta hear this song” moments. I’m open-minded, respectful, and not here to waste anyone’s time.
And no, I won’t ghost you. I know how to hold a convo and actually enjoy it.

If you’re down to talk, just tell me your age and gender when you message. That’s all.
Let’s make something cool out of this.

Some friendly reminders: I try to only go to shops that either make/use locally roasted beans and/or housemade syrups. I really like flavored lattes, particularly iced vanilla lattes, so that's mainly my order. For anyone who's wanting to give me shit about it- people have different tastes than you. It's okay. You're safe. And- your tastes are valid too. Just don't make fun of mine.

Also a side note, convenience is very important to me. parking, knowing the menu ahead of time, location, ect. is all fairly important to me. I avoided coffee shops like quills coffee for example, because I couldn't find their menu online, and when I called, it wanted me to give a call-back number. stuff like that is very irritating to me. I'm a pretty orderly person, so things like that are just frustrating.

* MOTW coffee 2/10 — awful service when I went. I ordered a biscoff latte. the barista poured the espresso with chunks of biscoff butter over ice, then milk. ew.
* good vibes cafe (NEW) 3/10 - this place has fine waffles, but it smells funky and the coffee isn't worth paying for.
* normal coffee (NEW) 4/10 - not very good. I really didn't like it.
* neidhammer coffee co. 5/10 - I was honestly really disappointed. I got the nutella latte, and it very bitter. the crepes were also super mediocre. not worth the money.
* provider 5/10 — nice aesthetic of the place, but pretty small. overall the coffee was fine.
* bovaconti coffee 6/10 — same with provider, but their service was wonderful. their only housemade syrup is for their spanish latte, otherwise they're a mix of 1884 (?) and monin.
* indie coffee roasters 6/10 (uses monin other than some sig drinks) — their signature drinks have house made syrups, otherwise they use monin. their signature drinks are definitely worth a try.
* illumine coffee 6/10 - it was okay, it's one of the few shops on this list that has monin syrups. I will say, they are in a very convenient spot. they have a lot of space, are open later than others, and have a lot nearby and good parking.
* mocha nut coffee (NEW) 6/10 - their drinks are fine, but they sound way better than they taste in my opinion. not the biggest fan of their vanilla or banana miso, but I'm hoping they have some amazing fall seasonals.
* rivet coffee bar (NEW) 6/10 - again, not crazy memorable. their syrups aren't housemade, but the location is super cool. bring someone who likes cool cars here.
* tinker coffee co. 7/10 — pretty good! just nothing to write home about.
* barista parlor 7/10 - not bad! just kind of hard to find, and parking kind of sucked.
* parlor public house (NEW) 7/10 - extremely beautiful shop, and offers both cocktails and THC drinks after 5pm. interesting seasonals, just not a favorite for me.
* coat check coffee (NEW) 7/10 - pretty good! it's in a fun location, but not my favorite overall.
* prufrock coffee 8/10 — the fun canning experience with a to go drink made it so much better. and, the coffee is really good.
* bluemind coffee 8/10 - very yummy, and they had a banana drink! super fun flavors, and a very cute location.
* helm (NEW) 8/10 - honestly really good! their vanilla just isn't my favorite, but I want to go back and try their ube (which is also housemade, unlike most coffee shops using salamat! ube, which is also yummy.)
* the well (NEW) 9/10 - very good! they had really cool specials, and they're based around a charity!
* mansion society (NEW) 9/10 - very cool place! their drinks are pretty good, and the only quarrel I have is that the service is a bit slow. to be fair, all the times I've gone there's only been one person working.
* commissary barber and barista 9/10 — omg. one of my favorites. they’re also a bar!
* ascend coffee 9/10 — genuinely the only good coffee around castleton. very kind people, and their seasonal menus are so good. friendly warning- their syrups are definitely not the sweetest. If you like sweet drinks, I recommend asking for an ""extra sweet"" of whatever you're getting!
* dream palace coffee 9/10 - truly a delight. parking fucking sucks though.
* skosh (NEW) 9/10 - I absolutely love their vanilla syrup. they'd be a 10/10, but I've heard some shitty things about the owner, and depending on the barista working, I either can't be left alone or I have to ask for my drink to be remade because there's coffee grounds in my drink.
* rabble coffee (NEW) 9/10 - honestly a very cute spot! the baristas are so kind, and their drinks are so yummy. my only nitpick is that their menu isn't online, and for a place that changes their specials each month, it drives me a little nuts lol.
* YAFA golden coffee 10/10 (mainly just their pumpkin spice lattes) — their pumpkin spice is to die for. best in the city. overall though, eh. they keep their pumpkin for a majority of the year though I believe.
* calvin fletchers 10/10 - everyone was correct to say this place is DELICIOUS. super yummy coffee, fun seasonals, and they're next to my absolute favorite restaurant, bluebeard. get a latte and then run next door.
* brickhouse coffee 10/10 - PLEASE go here. the pastries are soooo good, they have lunch options, and if you love sweet lattes you need to try the triple b latte with their bourbon brown butter caramel syrup. truly a treat. they also sell their syrups! I literally love this place soooo much.
* amberson coffee & grocer 10/10 (UPDATED) — really cute, hole in the wall sort of place. the downside is if you’d like a to-go drink, they require you pay an extra dollar for a jar you bring back. not very convenient to use, messy if you’re moving at all and trying to take a sip. very yummy though. I tried this place again, and if you're craving some seriously good espresso, this is the place to go.
* mochijoy (NEW) 10/10 - absolutely golden spot. housemade syrups, delicious donuts, and I've never had a bad experience. they are truly never busy enough. only nitpick- they pour their espresso in like a starbucks macchiato. not my favorite, but I try and look away lol.

PLEEEEASE keep leaving me recommendations! I absolutely love researching new coffee shops and giving my two cents! also, please let me know if you try any place I recommend. it makes me so happy when people tell me they like a place I told them about! also- feel free to ask if you want a more in-depth review of any place. I try to keep these short n sweet. also- I know my reviews talk a lot about syrups. but I think if I'm going to add a flavor to my latte that can change the flavor of the espresso, it's important. people make their syrups differently, and it's very uncommon that I'll go somewhere and it taste the same as somewhere else.

1l0xzvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1l0xzvg/the_roots_within/,The Roots Within,"I believe
a parent’s true task
is to raise a child who trusts
the whisper inside,
the holy echo,
the voice that says:
Be a warrior for Christ.

We live in this world —
a world of broken molds,
imperfect expectations
shaped to chase
a perfect face,
a perfect name,
a perfect life
that never was.

Most of us
carry a god complex
we didn’t ask for,
wearing the mold
they pressed us into,
unaware,
unwilling,
unbroken.

Oh, we dream —
dream of sitting on porches
overlooking still waters,
coffee in hand,
a paintbrush,
a book that holds us
like warm water,
soaking the soul.

But the reality?
We’re still playing
by a rulebook
written by men,
who misunderstood
the heart of God.

We are the same —
yet so
achingly, beautifully,
wildly different.

The enemy has built
a kingdom of chains,
stretching high
into the clouds,
tethered deep
to the earth’s core.

Flames made of words,
bullets made of shame,
roots digging
into our feet,
until they bloom
into a second skin:
unworthiness,
judgment,
self-hate.

And we bleed,
bleed that shame
into the world.

We run,
but we run in circles —
a treadmill perfect in design,
yet leading nowhere.
And the circle shrinks,
and shrinks,
until we can’t breathe.

We can’t tell
the voice of God
from the voice
of the enemy.
It all sounds the same —
blending,
baking,
folding together,
like a heavy,
confusing casserole.

Good feels like bad.
Bad feels like good.
And somewhere along the way,
we whisper:
I’m bad.

We let it become
our playbook,
our way of life.
Money.
Power.
Status.
The chase,
the hunger.

But if we just step back —
look,
truly look —
at the birds,
the flowers,
the animals,
the trees —
they are cared for,
they are held,
they thrive
without a dollar
to their name.

Vibrant.
Abundant.
Mystical.
Real.
Dependent only
on the hand of their Creator.

And still,
we wrestle.
We question:
Why does nature kill?
Why do animals devour?
And we try to fold it all
into God’s will.

But maybe that’s the thing.
Maybe the problem is
we don’t see:
we are all connected —
threaded invisibly,
from Africa
to Asia,
to the icy poles,
to the bustling cities,
to the deepest caves.

Above,
below,
beside,
within.

We step into the arena,
our nervous systems shudder,
and we forget
how to tell
which roots are God’s
and which roots
are the enemy’s.

They twist.
They turn.
They merge.

There is a war inside —
the roots
fighting
for permanent ground
within us.

And maybe,
just maybe —
there’s room,
in this aching,
beautiful world,

1l0xzmq,https://i.redd.it/7prdsmppbd4f1.png,Dutch Pen Show haul,"I went to my first pen show yesterday, and I loved it!

Consists of:

* a Japanese pen pouch made from kimono fabric (soft and padded inside, it's so nice!)
* inks: Dominant Industry Fairy Forest, Diamine Communication Breakdown, Colorverse Space Laika and two sample vials of Waterfront Dusk – I was especially excited to see the last one since last time I checked, I couldn't order that ink to Europe
* a small purchase that was a lovely wood-free, non-breaking pencil from recycled graphite
* the bright green pen is Black Forest Pen, I saw green and I saw floral patterns and I knew I had to get it. I could also pick a nib for it on the spot!
* the dark green pen in the front is, I am not sure of the exact model but the brand is Tabo and it is my first fountain pen with a flexible nib which is very exciting – now I have to learn to write with it because all I can do for now are pretty figure 8's
* and an unexpected but lovely and elegant purchase: the wooden dip pen made by a Polish artist Marcin Lewicki. I chose a cheaper and simpler one since I was already hitting my budget, but he makes magical dip pens – what he makes with wood feels impossible, some look like twisting ribbons or wisps of smoke, if you just want to stare at pretty wooden dip pens, he has an instagram and an etsy store

Interesting thing I did not get due to budget but that was really neat – there was also a guy there from Germany who makes pens from all sorts of things, from Australian pinecones, wood, coffee beans (they actually smelled like coffee, it was wild!) or cinnamon – I will certainly take another look at his work when I have more money to spend

Overall, a very fun and successful day! I was a bit worried about spending money due to some things I have going on now, but ultimately I don't regret it. I had a lot of fun, I did not expect to be able to get so many things – let's just say I know how much good and beautiful pens can cost and compared to that, my budget was not that high. But it was really fun, and I talked to many friendly people, and if I am around when it comes next year, I'll probably also go :3",3,1748807183.0,fountainpens,1,1.0,False

One day I didn't feel like going to work, I didn't feel sick, but still I felt like trash and my mood was all bad. I'd ordered something online and figured I could drive my car and pick it up since I chose to stay home. In my car I suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe properly, my heart started pumping out of my chest and I felt like I was about to die. I managed to turn around and got home, laying in the bed until next day. Couldn't figure out what it was. I thought I just needed som rest and maybe I was sick after all. Few weeks later I had my second panic attack, out of nowhere in the doctors room, waiting for an appointment for my kid. I managed to keep myself kinda calm, ran out of the doctors office after the appointment and drove back home, laying in the bed again. 

Next day I went to the doctor, she diagnosed me with stress and panic anxiety. My brain was all messed, I constantly felt like crap, couldn't sleep properly, my anxiety got worse - even talking to my family could trigger it. My doctor would then describe me some meds - but I've always been stubborn and don't want to rely on any medications. 

Instead I started at a psychologist, but nothing seemed to help. Talking about my past and feelings didn't do much. I then started reading some books about stress coaching and anxiety, about the brains and body's health. What if it could be as simple that my body and mind was out of balance and I had to bring it back? 

I looked into my diet, sleep and exercise and found that my diet was all trash, my sleep was very poor and I didn't do any exercise at the time. I told myself that to bring back my mind and body in balance I had to give it the best possible conditions.

What I did:
I stopped eating any sugary food and drinks. Stopped drinking coffee, alcohol. Started eating healthier 
foods, vegetables, berries and lean
protein sources and non processed foods. It took months before my body adapted to the new way of eating, but very fast I felt a lot better. I started working out in the local gym, in the beginning I could only manage 10-20 minutes, before feeling fatigued. But I kept pushing forward, with the only thing driving me that I wanted to be healthy and happy again, living life with my kids. I started, doing breathing exercises, 10 minutes every evening - and I've done em ever since. 

This is now 3 years ago, I haven't got a single panic attack since. Today I feel better than ever, I exercise 6 times a week, running 30-40 km a week and still haven't touched alcohol or caffeine. My diet is still healthy overall but I can still eat what I want if I'm feeling for it. I live a much more simple life, I don't watch the news - I try to keep my focus on what's happening around me instead. I work full time and have never been happier. I found that telling my self that I want to be happy, focusing on the good things in life makes my brain a lot happier and healthier, than talking about all my problems. 

I hope this long post can be the inspiration to others out there struggling with the same stuff as I did. Trust your self and keep going, if you want to be free for anxiety and stress, it is possible! It takes time and effort, but it is possible.

His dad is unemployed for medical reasons and he does not seem to really have the means to take care of my son anymore. For the past month they have been getting into arguments about my son eating crackers and milk without asking he’s 14 and his dad is telling me that my son is the problem while I can’t see that at all. When I try to send my son money for food and things he says he doesn’t need to be asking “people” for stuff. 

Friday morning he had some packets of oatmeal for breakfast and an hour later he tried to make something to eat but his dad and his dad’s girlfriend smelled something burning. They asked him why he was even making anything if he had just ate and were apparently lashing out at him together. My son was crying and mad and he punched a hole in the wall and his dad had him admitted into an inpatient hospital for juveniles. 

I asked his aunt who is closer to pick him up and his dad said that he will get a restraining order if he tries. I have four kids here, I’m broke and also have surgery on Saturday that I have to pay for so I’m broke until after that. Ironically my insignificant other here came into a few thousand yesterday and has not said anything about picking him up at all started to buy things immediately we don’t need like mushroom coffee, Lego sets, tv stands, liquor and other things. 

I’ve given him money everytime he needed this year for wants AND emergencies. I even put my pride aside Friday and told him I really needed his help so he knows exactly what’s going on. He’s currently having a grand time drinking and playing call of duty joking around with his friends like I’m not mentally and physically drowning. I also overheard him say to them that my son is there because he doesn’t “listen” to his dad and wants to get his way. Followed up by “He wouldn’t mind” going to get him but he would have to have time for that shyt he works everyday. I can’t do anything but feel like a zombie my son that’s here is the only one that sees it he keeps saying it’ll be okay and hugging me and for once that’s just not helping",2,1748807097.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

* A good local breakfast spot, more low-key and not swamped with tourists
* Best coffee shops near the Market Commons area (preferably with a chill vibe and good lattes)

Seokga is a trickster god, exiled from the heavenly kingdom of Okhwang. Hani is an ancient gumiho, once notorious as the bloodthirsty Scarlet Fox, now she works in a coffee shop. Seokga is her least favourite customer. Hani hasn't eaten a man in one hundred and four years, she's been too full since her binge in 1888. But she wishes she could make an exception for him.

Seokga is working as a detective. He is tasked with tracking down Unrulies as his punishment for letting twenty thousand of them into Okhwang in a coup against his brother Emperor Hwanin. When he was defeated the monsters fled to the mortal realm, Iseung, and as punishment he must hunt down all twenty thousand of them and send them to Yeomra in Jeoseung, the underworld. The police chief, Shim, wants Seokga to take on an assistant to help him.

Hani is attacked on the way home from work by two drunk men. She kills them with her claws and decides to take their livers for her coworker Somi, who is a young gumiho and has never had human liver before since it has been an illegal practice for many years now.

The next morning Hani overhears Chief Shim in the coffee shop talking about how Seokga needs an assistant more than ever now that he is investigating the Scarlet Fox situation. Hani realises they are talking about the bodies she carelessly left behind. She panics and decides to offer her services as an assistant so that she can keep Seokga off her trail.

Seokga is furious that Shim hired Hani but Shim warns him that if he doesn't cooperate with her he will report him to his brother Hwanin. Seokga reluctantly brings Hani to inspect the body of a young gumiho and interview her soul. She doesn't remember how she died and her body is covered in black veins. When the forensic pathologist, Dok-hyun, cuts into one of her veins darkness seeps out and Soekga declares this the work of an eoduksini

Eoduksini are demons of darkness. They worm their way into people's minds and create nightmares based on their worst fears. When their prey is immobilised by the nightmare then they feed on their life force. Seokga suspects that this eodoksini may be one of his Unrulies that has finally managed to possess a corporeal form and wants revenge.

Hwanin summons Seokga to meet him for the first time in 628 years. Hwanin is so worried about threats to the mortal realm that be offers Seokga a deal: kill the eoduksini and the Scarlet Fox and Seokga's punishment will be over, he can return to Okhwang as a god without hunting down the rest of the twenty thousand Unrulies. Seokga enthusiastically agrees.

The next day Seokga and Hani attend to the death of a haetae killed by the eoduksini. It is almost identical to the case of the gumiho except for one thing: there was a witness. The haetae was killed outside the cafe where he worked and a mortal girl had been working with him at the time, however now she is missing. They resolve to find her before the eoduksini does.

Seokga and Hani start looking for the witness, a girl named Choi Ji-ah. They speak to a friend of hers who said there is a place Ji-ah runs to when she wants to be alone, an abandoned village on Geoje island. Hani asks a reaper named Hyun-tae who has a crush on Somi to take a job at the cafe and look out for her while they are gone.

Before they leave for Geoje they get a report of three more bodies and head to the precinct to inspect them. Unlike the previous two, these bodies have mutilated. Dok-hyun informs them that the bodies had the same black veins that indicate they were killed by the eoduksini, but it must be angry to have been so violent this time. Likely because it cannot find Ji-ah. Hani begins to think that Dok-hyun knows a suspicious amount about the eoduksini. Seokga has him detained to be safe until they are certain.

When they finally make it to the abandoned village they are attacked by gwisin and Hani's leg is injured but they find Ji-ah. It's too late to travel back to the city that night so they bring Ji-ah to a nearby hotel. There aren't enough rooms so Soekga and Hani reluctantly share a bed.

The next morning when they talk to Ji-ah her description of the eoduksini matches Dok-hyun's appearance. Seokga tries to call Shim to update him but he doesn't pick up. Ji-ah gets upset when she realises Seokga isn't human and runs from them.

Soekga is worried when nobody answers the phone at the precinct and doesn't know whether to head back there or keep searching for Ji-ah. He decides to find a yojeong, to help them find out what's going on. Soekga knows of one who lives nearby, but they must make a bargain for the knowledge they need and she demands that Seokga and Hani kiss. They do so and the yojeong reveals that the city precinct has fallen, meaning the the eoduksini is free, but fortunately Shim is alive.

Back in the city Soekga and Hani start planning a trap to lure the eoduksini. They awkwardly confess that they are beginning to like eachother. Hani stays at Seokga's apartment and early in the morning he gets a call that three more bodies have been found. This time they are attributed to the Scarlet Fox as their souls and livers are missing.

Hani goes to speak to Somi who admits that it was her who killed the men. She has been craving liver ever since Hani fed it to her and she couldn't control it. While Soekga is talking with Somi and Hyun-tae at the cafe Hani sneaks off in fox form to destroy the cameras from the crime scene and dump the bodies in the river.

They begin their plan to lure the eoduksini by visiting a nightclub and pretending to have their guard down partying. Luring the eoduksini works but it puts them to sleep before they can leave the club. It shows Hani a vision in her dream of Somi crying over the livers of more men she has killed. She cannot see the eoduksini's face but it speaks to Somi and tells her Hani is the Scarlet Fox. It turns Somi against Hani and to its side. When Soekga wakes up everyone in the club has been slaughtered.

Hani takes another day to wake up. While she was asleep the situation has gotten much worse. The whole city is shrouded in darkness and Somi has stopped trying to resist her killing. She has killed 20 more men and is known to be working with the eoduksini. The police are certain she is the Scarlet Fox.

Hani refuses to let Somi be killed and starts to plan how they can catch her. She asks Hyun-tae to find out how many deaths there will be in the city that night by taking a reaper shift. If it is high they will know that Somi or the eoduksini are going to strike. Hani wonders why Soekga woke up so much sooner than her after the eoduksini put them to sleep and realised it could be related to how much coffee he drinks.

While they wait for Hyun-tae to get the reaping numbers from Jeoseung, Soekga and Hani finally make love. Afterwards she makes Seokga promise to give Somi a chance to explain herself before he does anything to hurt her.

Hyun-tae reports that there will be seven deaths in the next two hours. They each drink fifteen cups of coffee. When Hyun-tae gets the call that the bodies have been found the three of them head to the scene. Hani then uses her fox form to track Somi's scent. It leads them to a warehouse.

They enter the warehouse and fight through a horde of Unrulies. They lose sight of Hyun-tae but when they finally find Somi he is standing by her side. Hyun-tae reveals that he is the eoduksini, his true name is Eodum. He planted clues to make them suspect Dok-hyun and has been watching the pair of them the whole time. Somi tries to get Hani to admit she is the Scarlet Fox and when she doesn't she attacks her. Eodum attacks Soekga.

Eodum starts to drain the life from Soekga. Seeing this, Hani knocks out Somi and turns on Eodum. To save Soekga she drains all the power from her fox bead, but even the centuries of souls are not enough to kill Eodum. And now Hani is dying too. She prays to Hwanin as she dies.

Hani finds her consciousness in Okhwang and pleads with Hwanin to help Soekga. He knows she is the Scarlet Fox and agrees to adjust his bargain with Seokga. If he kills one of the two Unrulies he will regain half of his power. When he kills the other he will regain the rest. When she returns to her body Hani forces Soekga to push a dagger through her heart.

With half his godly powers back Soekga easily defeats Eodum. Hani's soul has left her body and before she is reaped she confesses all to him. Soekga begs Hwanin to allow her to be reincarnated. Initially Hwanin refuses, Hani has killed far too many people to be allowed reincarnation. But hope of mending his relationship with his brother makes him relent and he agrees to let Hani reincarnate.

Twenty six years later Soekga feels the pull of a red fate thread. It is the connection of destined lovers and he knows that Hani's soul is waiting for him somewhere on the other end.

Before i start i want to apologize in advance if you guys see any mistakes from my typing, because English isn't my mother language and this post will be **long, really really long**

Now before i start the story i will share a little **context**

Me and my mother never really had awesome relationship. You see i am the 3rd child and the youngest. I had 2 brother, first one is born 1978, second on 1983 and i am born 1994. Huge age gap between me and my siblings. I didn't mind at all because my eldest brother was there to protect me when i needed. My 2nd brother unfortunately was diagnosed with Muscular dystrophy at the age of 7 and was prevented to walk, i wasn't even born when that happened with my brother, after i was born i knew him only in wheelchair. My parents was paying a lot of attention for my brother (understandably) he needed them the most since his condition and i wasn't complaining at all, because i really loved my brother and all i wanted with him is to spend time either playing on the Nintendo or playing words game ( he loved those, so am i). Unfortunately my brother passed away at the age of 16 and even though that i didn't understand what happened i kept asking my mom where is my brother until one day she told me that he became a star and that he will no longer come back. After that everything with my mom changed. I used to have busy childhood, i started going on piano lessons at the age of 6, i was going on modern dances, i was studying English. Everything that i wanted to do i did it. From everything that i was going only the piano lessons go all the way till i turned 18 and my English classes because not only i wanted to study another language, English became mandatory subject to know after my mother language. 

Now over the years, when i accomplished something i saw that mother didn't care that much, just like she used to, when my brother was alive. When i had math assignment i asked her for help, because she is a engineer and she knew math like second skin and all she did was yelling at me saying ""how can you not know this simple thing, are you stupid?"" mind you i am 11 years old child which was just introduced to advance math. When i had a school play, she was never there, she started skipping even my piano concerts, which was odd for her, because she used to come to all of my concerts. Anyways, i stopped inviting her because i knew that she wouldn't be there and when she knew that i got some kind of reward she would put the blame on me asking why wouldn't i told her, it didn't matter that she wouldn't come.

Years go by and i find myself to enjoy acting, there was a newly lesson for theater play's open up and it was free and i decided to join and see how it went. I was surprised by the talent i had even my teacher told me that i was natural. I was going there for 4 year (High school years) and the year that i graduated, we were playing a very interesting play and after that people like me who was graduating HS was about to get rewarded. I knew about this and this time i decided to tell my mom and invite her to come. She said that this isn't serious and that there is no future in theaters play so she might not come. I was expecting that but i decided to push it and begged her to come. 

**The day of the play**

Everything went beautifully, i was playing a very major role and i was very proud of how i did my part, at the end the principle came out and she invited our parents to come join us while she was giving us the awards and saying very beautiful things about our play. Every single mother and father or the other kids was there except for my parents. I stood on stage lonely looking at the other parents how proud were they from their kids and here am i standing here alone. I was about to cry looking at the scene but i hold my tears while the principle came to me and she hugged me and told the audience the most beautiful words about me and my performance. After that i went to the make-up room and i cried my eyes out because i had no one to celebrate my success. When my mom found out what happened she asked me why i didn't told her that i was going to get rewarded after the play. I reminded her that i told her and she just simply said "" oh i must've forgotten"" 

**Present day**

I am skipping to now because now it's more important than the past and i am very sure that you guys already had a vision of how my mother is. 

Now i am 30, soon to be 31, married to the love of my life and my best friend and we have a beautiful baby boy together which turned 1year at May 29th.

Last year when i was getting married i asked my brother and his wife to be our whitnessess for the wedding. They agreed and for my son's birthday i was organizing also a baptism and i asked my brother if he will have something against the idea of my niece (his 2nd child) to be the Godmother to my son. Of course he agreed and he was happy and he even said that he and my SIL was thinking the same thing. Me and my husband was very happy about that and when my niece found out she was beyond happiness. 

**May 28th**

My whole family arrived to the town where i currently live so we can get prepared for next day. Everything went smoothly until my little niece which is 7 years old tried to hold my son and she almost drop him from the couch. I asked her to not pick up my son if there is nobody from us near her because she can drop him and hurt him. She said okay and 3 seconds later she again was picking my son from the walker trying to place him on the couch. This time i yelled at her and slap her on the hand to show her that this isn't appropriate and again she can hurt him. My mom said ""don't yell at her it's not a big deal"". I rolled my eyes, because for all of those 30 years i know that my mother favourite my brother more then me and here's in a fresh example. 3 weeks before my son's birthday my mom told me that she prepared 1000$ for my son (just to clarify this in my currency is a lot because it double the amount when you transfer it). I asked her if she's sure because that's a lot of money and she told that her and my dad was talking about it and she said that she saved up just for my son for months. I said okay. 1 week later, she called me and told me that she will no longer give those money to me because my brother needs them to pay my niece exam for univeristy (in my country we don't have college so after HS we are going into University). I asked her if my brother cannot afford her tuition why she's even starting in private university when she can go to public one and the degree that she wants to have isn't 1000$ per semester but it's 100$ per semester and she said that i don't need to involve myself because this isn't my business and my brother needs those money more then me. Let me be clear here i am on mathernity leave and i am getting like 500$ per month for my child, which trust me this isn't enough because baby food and everything is very very expensive, my husband is getting enough money but with those money we have some mortgage to cover and all that's left is for us is food and some other house utilities like kitchen paper, garbage bags etc. My brother on the other hand he has his own business which he is making furniture and he has a very big clients from all across Europe, my SIL is a teacher and teachers in my country are the highest paying job right now, even doctors didn't make that amount of money like the teachers, also she is giving English classes because she is English teacher and she also had a hair saloon. You got the picture. 

I asked my mom how my brother needs those money more then me when she knew mine and my husband situation about finanses, but she brushed me off and hung up. I was done, i was expecting nothing from this point from her. 

**MAY 29th**
The whole morning i felt sick and i was nervious because some people told me that they won't be able to make it last minute so i was calling the owner of the restaurant letting her know what i happening then i was rushing to go to take the candles and take them to the church and after that all i really wanted is to rest because i felt like i was about to puke from nervs. My brother and his family went around the town for a coffee and my mom asked me why i am not going out with him. I told her that i am not feeling well and that i want to rest because it's a busy day. She said that i must go and be with my brother because it's not ethical to leave him alone going around the town where i live. I brush her off and i just went to rest because my son was also sleeping and i took that as advantage to get some rest. 
After that everything went well. My son was baptised we had celebration afterwards me and my husband came home at 2am. It was amazing. 

**MAY 30th**
We woke up everything was fine. My brother and my SIL and my little niece are already up and they're waiting for my older niece and her bf to come to my place so they can get going to my hometown.
My SIL opened up the fridge and she said: ""OMG you guys didn't say that you have a cake left"" at 10am in the morning. My 7y.o. niece is very spoiled, rotten spoiled, she doesn't give a damn about who is warning her to not do something, when my brother and SIL doesn't say anything this means that it's all fine. 
My niece started yapping "" i want cake, i want cake and i want the lion as well"" i told her that she cannot have the lion, because the lion is a decoration and it's not edible, but she kept telling my SIL that she wants the lion. Then i just open the fridge, took the lion out and told my SIL and my niece "" she can have as much cake as she wants, but the lion is not to be touched"" and i put the lion elsewhere. 
My brother was like "" why are you being so aggressive towards your niece, i am seeing you from the day that we arrive that you're being really nasty towards her"". I told him that she is unhindged and i reminded him how many times she wouldn't drop my son on the ground and that nobody said anything about that. 
My brother understood and he apologized but my SIL she sat on the couch turn on zombie mode while watching her phone and doesn't pay attetion to anything including her child. 

After my brother left i went to pay for the decoration and then i came home. 
Whole morning i saw that my mother was snatching her fingers and she was trying to get with me on something and now she has it. 

When i come home she said ""Your brother was very upset with you and your nasty behaviour towards you niece, how are you this shameless to act like that towards your own brother child"" and i answer with a question "" How can my own brother child torment my child and you didn't say anything about it?"" She shut up for a moment and then she continued "" You know you could just give your niece that lion, is not big deal"" Then i said "" Mom, those things are for my son, not for her, she cannot have everything that my son have, all of those things i order and pay for him, not for her, if my niece wants something she should be going to my brother and SIL not to me and take things that's supposed to belong to my son"". She said that i crossed boundries and then i snapped and this is where i might be the AH:
""You know this is my house and you're here as guest, when i want something to be in my way it will be in my way, when i come to visit you at my home town i don't cross any boundries that you put, i expect the same in my own home, if something that i do isn't suit for you, here is the door"" and i pointed at the door. 
She saw red and told my dad to pack their things and leave and she start saying things like: ""Your brother never in his life has ever kicked me out from his house, you're a discrace to treat your own mother like that"" i told her that i gave her the option and she choose to leave so to not put the blame on me"". She continied to insult me and saying that i am dead for her that she doesn't want to see me anymore, i kept telling her how awfully she treated me and how she prefer my brother, how i should kept a secret how much money she gave me for my son, because my brother would get upset of the amount (the amount she gave me for my son was 250$ and she gave my niece for her graduation party 300$), i told her that for many years i hold it together when it was so obvious that she loved my brother more then me. SHe told me to shut up because she didn't want to die at my house and i told her that i won't shut up because i will keep telling her the truth, i told her that she is the reason why i start going to therapy, because she never values my opinion and i was always on the wrong. 
I started to cry and shake after everything i said and my husband came with my child and told me to go to our room with my son and then i heard him yelling at my mom, telling her how he has enough of her games and that he was holding it for so long because i told him to, but now he was done, he told her that she didn't realise what damage she is causing and that she just made me cry again for a nothing, he told her that she's finneshed and she needs to leave. She even wanted to come and say goodbye to me and my son but my husband prevented it, my dad he didn't say anything towards my husband, he knew he was right but when they were at the stairs my dad told my husband to stop yelling because my grandma could hear them. 

The whole day i was emotional wreck, i couldn't even celebrate my son's 1st birthday normally because of my niece and then the next morning that happened. 

Right now i am in no contact with my mom and my entire family, because of her. 

So Reddit, be the judge, Am i the AH to yelling at my mom after she made me feel i am not wanted? ",2,1748806652.0,AITAH,0,0.75,False

Headphones Used : Sony WH-1000XM5 / Sony WH-1000XM4 / Sony WF-1000MX4 / Bose QuietComfort Ultra / Apple Airpods Pro 2 / Sennheiser Momentum 4

**Test 1 (Coffee Shop /** [**Video used** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiMXGIG_DQo&t=10360s)**)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

This have astonishing sound quality, but this is not why we are here. The Momentum 4 have a decent ANC, but its noticeable a step behind the competitors. Its like a step behind the XM4, while the XM4 are already a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra. The Momentum 4 cancelled the high frecuency noises very well tho, again, about 85%. But the background chatter was cancelled about 70%, and the sudden loud voices about 70% too. Its ANC is enough, for me atleast, but its not as good as Sony or Bose.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 are basically a step behind the XM5, just like you would excpect, since the XM5 is the direct upgrade from the XM4. The XM4 cancelled less background chatter, comparing it to the XM5 and Bose, the XM4 cancelled about 77.5%, its noticeable but not an absolute enormous gap. The XM4 did cancell very well the sudden loud voices tho. probably 77.5% aproximately, maybe 75%. They did cancell very well the high frecuency noises too, probably 85%, like the Bose. Overall is a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra, but its still an absolute banger for ANC to the date, its just there are better options now.

**4.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Im absolutely surprised here, the Airpods Pro 2 cancelled the background chatter about what? 95%!!?? It absolutely surprised me, they cancelled better than the Bose flagship over the ear headphones, and better than Sony WH-1000XM5! Even the loud sudden voices were cancelled by about 90% ??!! They absolutely smashed it! Tho I musyt say, they did not cancell the high frecuencies very well, comparing to the rest, they probably cancelled about 70%, they felt short in that aspect, but for the voices they absolutely nailed it.

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

With the XM5, the high noises were equally cancelled comparing them to the bose, about 85% probably. Now, the background chatter only, the Sony cancelled about 85% of the background chatter. The sudden kid and loud voices was cancelled by an average of 82.5% probably, a tad worse than the Bose here.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra\*\*

With the Bose QC Ultra (Over the ear), the high frecuency noises like the forks, cups or that sort of stuff, the Bose cancelled it very good, some of the cup noises leaked but very muffled, by average the high frecuency noises were cancelled by about 85%. The background chatter was cancelled by 90% aprox, and the kids or loud sudden voices were cancelled about 85%, overall a pretty awesome job and definetely close to being perfect.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

Im surprised again, the WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the Airpods when it comes to the voices. The background chatter was cancelled by about 92.5%. And the sudden loud voices were cancelled about 85%. Then, they cancelled the high frecuency noises by about 85%!

**Test 2 (Plane Noise /** [**Video used**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEGmghn_jo&t=392s) **)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

The rumble noise on the Momentum 4 was cancelled about 80%-85%, but the ""wind"" noise itself was not as greatly cancelled, it was drained out about 75%, which its a very noticeable downgrade from the 90% of the QC Ultra and XM5.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

These ones, like the in-ear version, also cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, while the ""wind"" noise is cancelled about 90%, like the XM5, the XM4 wind noise is sort of ""low"" frecuency wind, like the QC Ultra, and not like trying to whistle with your mouth, like the XM5. I found that besides the three Sonys cancelling all 92.5% of the rumble noise, the XM5 felt like the noise was a little more controlled, and both the WF and WH XM4 the rumble noise felt a little bit more ""loose"", so I would give the XM5 a very small gap just because of that.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

Here, the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, the ""air / wind"" nosie was cancelled about 90% too

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Just like the WF-1000XM4, I found that they cancelled also 100% of the ""wind"" noise, and 92.5% of the rumble engine noise.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 100% of the ""wind"" noise! And they also managed to cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise too! Im giving the WF-1000XM5 the lead over the APP2 since I felt that rumble noise was more ""controlled"", and not so loose like the APP2

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

The rumble noise itself of the engine, is 100% cancelled with the QC Ultra, but the ""air / wind"" sound itself, its still audible, aproximately cancelled by about 92.5% maybe, the XM5 ""wind"" nosie is more like a high frecuency wind, while the QC Ultra ""wind"" noise is like a more ""low"" frecuency wind. Its hard to explain, but its what I feel with them, the XM5 feels more like trying to whistle with your mouth, but not whistling, while the Bose feels like a relaxed engine noise without the rumble. Im giving Bose the win here, the rumble engine noise is gone and the wind noise is also cancelled almost perfectly, while yes, its not 100% cancelled like the in-ears, its still not that far and the rumble is completely gone, which is a more noticeable thing imo.

**Test 3 (Office /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sQXSdzk6U4&t=2456s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 cancelled about 87.5% of the sudden voices, about 90% of the keyboard noises, and I noticed a lot of low frecuency sound as background of the officce, the XM5 and the Bose cancelled it 100%, since I didnt even noticed it, but the XM4 create this low frecuency background sound, due to accumulation of sounds maybe, that cancell maybe 75%? Its like the airplane engine rumble lol, a big noticeable step behind on this specific sound, besides this low frecuency sound, they still perform good, but not as good as the XM5 and Bose. Whil yes, they cancell 5% more of the high noises than the in-ears, they are considerable worse on cancelling the sudden voices + they have this ""low"" frecuency sound which is very noticeable.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 cancelled 95% of the sudden voices, the same amount comparing it to the QC Ultra, but cancelled about 85% of the high frecuency noises, like the keyboard noises. Which is weird, watching how well they performed on Test 1 with high noises, but on this test, they didnt do as well. There is not a ""low"" frecuency sound like on the WH-1000XM4 and Momentum 4.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

The APP2, also did a not so good job with the high frecuency noises, like keyboards, they cancelled about 82.5%-85% noise. But when it comes to the sudden voices, they cancelled 97.5%, a tad better than the QC Ultra, to the point i had to focus to hear them. There is no ""low"" frecuency sound here.

**3.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

Surprisingly, the sudden voices were cancelled about 92.5%, yes, the same amount of noise cancelling than the XM5, and I would dare to say that it felt a very little tad quieter than the XM5 (in this specific sound), maybe is the rest of the more noticeable sounds masking it, but it felt quieter. the keyboard typing noises were cancelled about 87.5%, a tad worse than the XM4, and that ""low"" frecuency sound that was really noticeable on the XM4, here is way less, but its still there, maybe 90% cancelled, but not as bad on the XM4, which was about 75% cancelled. Im giving them the lead over the APP2 since they cancell more of the sudden high noises considerably, I prefer cancelling 5% better of those high noises instead of 5% better of those sudden voices, but you may prefer the APP2 if you like better cancelling more of the sudden voices instead of the sudden high noises. The ""low"" frecuency sound is there, but its very less notcieable than the XM4, so its not quite a big issue to me.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

While talking about the sudden high frecuency noises, specially the keyboard noises, I found that the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of those noises, the sudden voices were also cancelled about 92.5% too.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

With the Bose, I found they cancelled about 95% of the sudden voices, and they cancelled 92.5% of the sudden high noises, like the keyboards, just like the XM5.

**Test 4 (Library /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3_eIwDWS_c&t=40s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the background chatter, the chatter felt more ""free"" comparing to the more ""compressed"" and ""trapped"" feeling of the chatter on the XM5. The sudden noises were cancelled about 80%

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The WH-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 90% of the background chatter, yes, the same amount than the XM5. After A/B for several minutes and focusing, I felt that the XM4 chatter felt more ""free"" and the XM5 felt more ""trapped"", while cancelling the same amount. And they cancelled about 85% of the sudden noises, 2.5% worse than the XM5.

**4-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 90% of the background chatter, the Bose got quieter here by a small gap, but noticeable gap. The sudden noises were cancelled about 87.5% on the Sony.

**3-4/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

Surprisingly, the APP2 cancelled 95% of the background chatter, but the sudden noises were cancelled about 80%, a tad worse than the WF-1000XM4. But I would say that the 95% cancelling of the background chatter compensate the sudden noises cancelling.

**2-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

The WF-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 95% of the background chatter. But the sudden noises are more noticeable on the Sony, cancelling aproximately 85%, specially the high noises and pages turnings.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The Bose cancelled about 95% of the background chatter, which is a ""low"" frecuency sound type of feeling, the sudden noises like pages turning or foot steps were cancelled about 90%. Ok, Im giving the win to the Bose here, but its by an absolutely micro difference, I spent about 30m just A/B/C between the Bose, the WF-1000XM4 and the APP2. They all cancelled almost all of the background noise, in occasions I felt that one was better, and in others I felt the others were better. The bose took maybe 5s-10s to completely adapt and then it cancelled at their max potential, I would say that for moments it cancelled 100% of the chatter. The WF-1000XM4 at the start cancelled maybe a tad more than 95% or even 100% of the chatter, but then it dropped to 95%, this might be due the ear tips fit, which is impossible to make them stay still 100% (Already tried all of them). But the high recuency sudden noises cancelling was better on the Bose here. What a competition, It took me a while to choose a winner here.

**Test 5 (Garden /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7qwcrKaUs) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The fountain sound was cancelled about 92.5%, its very reduced, but still there, and the birds noises were cancelled about 75%-80%, the Bose did a better job here, some of the bird noises i heard instantly on the APP2, with the Bose I didnt heard them for the first 2 times, then I focused and then I heard them.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 was able to cancell about 92.5% of the fountain noise, like the XM5. But the XM5 fountain noise felt more ""trapped"", while on the M4 felt more ""free"". The M4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the bird noise, which is a tad better than the WF-1000XM4 and a tad worse than the QC Ultra and XM5.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 managed to cancell 95% of the fountain noise, which is a little better than the APP2 but a little worse than the Bose and WF-1000XM4. The bird noises were cancelled about 85%, which is better than the in-ears, but a tad worse than the Bose.

**3.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

This time the WF-1000XM4 cancelled about 97.5% of the fountain noise, like the QC Ultra, and reduced about 80% of the bird noises, like the APP2. Again, the fountain noise is almost 100% killed, but when pausing / playing the video I could hear a small difference of the fountain noise, being very slightly noticeable when focusing.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the fountain noise, yes, 2.5% worse than the WH-1000XM4, but that might be the XM4 white noise camouflaging the fountain noise itself, but focusing purely on the fountain, the XM5 make it a tad more noticeable. But the bird noises were cancelled about 90%, like the QC Ultra.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The QC Ultra was able to cancell 97.5% of the fountain ""low"" frecuency water noise, the birds were cancelled by about 90%. A pretty good job. The fountain noise itself is almost 100% killed, you will probably dont notice it in a irl situation, I could tell a tiny bit of it was passing the ANC because I could tell a very small difference when pausing the video and putting it again, but again, its almost killed 100% once the ANC adapts after a few seconds.

**Test 6 (Rain /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-__3RANT4) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 90% of the rain noise, like the WH-1000XM4, and was able to cancell about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like all of the other over the ear headphones on the test.

**5.-3.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 was able to cancell 90% of the rain noise, a tad worse than the XM5. And it cancelled about 90% of the drops reaching the ground / water, just like the XM5 and QC Ultra.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the rain noise, and about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like the QC Ultra.

**3.-4.5/5⭐Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The rain itself was cancelled about 97.5%, while the drops touching the ground, probably was cancelled about 85%, not quite as good as the QC Ultra.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra**

95% of the rain itself was cancelled by the Bose, now, the drops touching the ground / water, was cancelled about 90%

**1.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER 🏆)**

The sound of the rain, was cancelled about 97.5%, like the APP2. But the drops touching the ground / water was cancelled about 85%.

**Test 7 (City /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3pj_3mdMc&t=15815s&pp=ygUUYW1iaWVuY2Ugc291bmRzIGNpdHk%3D) **)**

**6.-3/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 cancell about 85% of the background ""low"" noise, while they cancell about 75% of the people voices.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4, just like the XM5, cancell about 92.5% of the background ""low"" noise of the road, and they cancell about 80% of the people voices too.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

These ones cancell about 80% of the voices of the people. While they cancell, again, 92.5% of the ""low"" frecuency background noise, like the rest of this test do.

**3.-5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2 (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" nosie was cancelled by 95%. And the voices of the people ""passing by"" were cancelled by about 87.5%. The 5% remaining of the ""Low"" noise fells like a ""wind / white nosie"" type of noise, while the Bose is a ""light rumble"" type of noise.

**2.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (TIE 🏆)**

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 95% of the ""low"" frecuency noise. While they cancelled about 90% of the voices of the people.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" frecuency noise was cancelled about 95%. While the voices of the people ""passing by"" were reduced aproximately 90%. Alright this is a tie, the 3 headphones blocks the same amounbt of ""Low"" noise and the same amount of voices, like, literally almost 100% the same amount. Sometimes one headphone somehow adapts better and cancells half of a tad more. The APP2 5% remaining ""low"" nosie feels like a wind / light white noise, the 5% remaining of the QC Ultra and WF-XM4 feels like a light rumble of the road. Ill give a tie here, but I would stay with either the WF-XM4 or QC Ultra due I dont like that much the wind / white noise of the APP2 that remains. Tho the QC Ultra has a light white noise always due to ANC, and WF-XM4 requieres a very good seal to cancell properly, which it costs me sometimes. They all have their ""buts"".

  
**Conclusions 🎖️**

The Momentum 4 is a great headphone, but you can tell Sennheiser priority wasnt ANC, they achieve an awesome sound quality, but fall a little short when it comes to ANC and its competitors. While yes, its noticeable worst sometimes against the Bose, Sony and Apple. It isnt complete garbage, it gets the job done enough, at least for me, but there are better options.

The WH-1000XM4 holds very well for being 5 years old, while yes, its a step behind the QC Ultra, APP2 and WF-1000XM4, they are still incredible Noise cancelling headphones, surpasing almost everytime the Momentum 4 and being mostly on par with the WH-1000XM5.

The WH-1000XM5 is a slight upgrade from the WH-1000XM4 when it comes to ANC, but its not a huge difference, its Noise Cancelling its superb, but doing A/B testing did let me know that they are half a step behind the leaders here (APP2, WF-XM4 and QC Ultra), sometimes being an almost unnoticeable difference and sometimes being noticeable. Moving comparisons aside this is one of the best ANC you can get on a headphone right now.

The Airpods Pro 2 did surprise me a lot, they did match and even slightly surpass sometimes the QC Ultra capabilities when it comes to ANC, specially when it comes to constant noises like roads, rain and chatter. But, they fell significantly short when it came to cancell high frecuency noises, like the ones you find on an office or coffee shop, they are noticeable worst than the QC Ultra or WH-1000XM5, besides that, they do an awesome job and get in the same level of the QC Ultra.

The WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the APP2, but being better cancelling those high frecuency noises considerably, but being very slightly worst sometimes cancelling those constant noises. This ones are on par with the QC Ultra and imo slightly better on most of the occassions against the Airpods Pro 2. But, getting a perfect seal is crucial you have to find the right spor after trying for several time to achieve their 100% ANC capabilities, if not, the ANC will leak and it will not be the same, overall a surprising performance.

The QC Ultra, what would you excpect, Bose created ANC and they have been the kings, or the top 2 since their creation. After intense testing, almost 100% of the times the QC Ultra were very slightly superior than my XM5, they were on par with the APP2 and WF-XM4 cancelling those constant noise, sometimes very slightly worse and sometimes very slightly better, but what they do considerably better, is cancelling those high frecuency noises, sometimes those sounds on the APP2 were noticeable, and with the QC Ultra I would have to focus to pick them up. BUT, yes, there is always a but, they have slight white noise while using the ANC, on loud places it wont be as noticeable, but in some tests that things got very quiet, the white noise was slightly more noticeable. Imo its not bothering at al, but its there, just to let you all know.

Below Ill put the charts which are the gathering of the results we already viewed, and some notes to take in mind, it took me 3 days with very intense A/B testing, but it was fun and entretaining, thanks a lot for reading this! See you on the next time!

\-The charts are the gathering of the results made on the A/B testing, they are not charts from internet or objective measurments

\-The % wont be 100% accurate to reality, I took them as reference or as a stand point to then calculate how much % would the others get, it may be lower / higher depdening on the situation you are.

\-ANC performance also depends highly of how much of a good seal you get with your headphones, if you wear glasses or if the ear tips of the in-ear dont fit on you, the ANC performance might be lowered.

\-The QC Ultra and WH-1000XM4 have slight white noise when using ANC on a quiet place, in most of loud places you wont hear it at all. On the APP2, WF-1000XM4, WH-1000XM5 and Momentum 4 I couldnt find any white noise on ANC while on a quiet place.

\-This was obtained by an A/B long testing, I did not base myself on any online charts or objective stats measurments on internet. This was pure listening and focusing on which cancelled more noise than the other.

Headphones Used : Sony WH-1000XM5 / Sony WH-1000XM4 / Sony WF-1000MX4 / Bose QuietComfort Ultra / Apple Airpods Pro 2 / Sennheiser Momentum 4

**Test 1 (Coffee Shop /** [**Video used** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiMXGIG_DQo&t=10360s)**)**

**6.-3/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

This have astonishing sound quality, but this is not why we are here. The Momentum 4 have a decent ANC, but its noticeable a step behind the competitors. Its like a step behind the XM4, while the XM4 are already a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra. The Momentum 4 cancelled the high frecuency noises very well tho, again, about 85%. But the background chatter was cancelled about 70%, and the sudden loud voices about 70% too. Its ANC is enough, for me atleast, but its not as good as Sony or Bose.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 are basically a step behind the XM5, just like you would excpect, since the XM5 is the direct upgrade from the XM4. The XM4 cancelled less background chatter, comparing it to the XM5 and Bose, the XM4 cancelled about 77.5%, its noticeable but not an absolute enormous gap. The XM4 did cancell very well the sudden loud voices tho. probably 77.5% aproximately, maybe 75%. They did cancell very well the high frecuency noises too, probably 85%, like the Bose. Overall is a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra, but its still an absolute banger for ANC to the date, its just there are better options now.

**4.-4.5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

Im absolutely surprised here, the Airpods Pro 2 cancelled the background chatter about what? 95%!!?? It absolutely surprised me, they cancelled better than the Bose flagship over the ear headphones, and better than Sony WH-1000XM5! Even the loud sudden voices were cancelled by about 90% ??!! They absolutely smashed it! Tho I musyt say, they did not cancell the high frecuencies very well, comparing to the rest, they probably cancelled about 70%, they felt short in that aspect, but for the voices they absolutely nailed it.

**3.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

With the XM5, the high noises were equally cancelled comparing them to the bose, about 85% probably. Now, the background chatter only, the Sony cancelled about 85% of the background chatter. The sudden kid and loud voices was cancelled by an average of 82.5% probably, a tad worse than the Bose here.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra**

With the Bose QC Ultra (Over the ear), the high frecuency noises like the forks, cups or that sort of stuff, the Bose cancelled it very good, some of the cup noises leaked but very muffled, by average the high frecuency noises were cancelled by about 85%. The background chatter was cancelled by 90% aprox, and the kids or loud sudden voices were cancelled about 85%, overall a pretty awesome job and definetely close to being perfect.

**1.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER 🏆)**

Im surprised again, the WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the Airpods when it comes to the voices. The background chatter was cancelled by about 92.5%. And the sudden loud voices were cancelled about 85%. Then, they cancelled the high frecuency noises by about 85%!

**Test 2 (Plane Noise /** [**Video used**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEGmghn_jo&t=392s) **)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

The rumble noise on the Momentum 4 was cancelled about 80%-85%, but the ""wind"" noise itself was not as greatly cancelled, it was drained out about 75%, which its a very noticeable downgrade from the 90% of the QC Ultra and XM5.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

These ones, like the in-ear version, also cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, while the ""wind"" noise is cancelled about 90%, like the XM5, the XM4 wind noise is sort of ""low"" frecuency wind, like the QC Ultra, and not like trying to whistle with your mouth, like the XM5. I found that besides the three Sonys cancelling all 92.5% of the rumble noise, the XM5 felt like the noise was a little more controlled, and both the WF and WH XM4 the rumble noise felt a little bit more ""loose"", so I would give the XM5 a very small gap just because of that.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

Here, the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, the ""air / wind"" nosie was cancelled about 90% too

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Just like the WF-1000XM4, I found that they cancelled also 100% of the ""wind"" noise, and 92.5% of the rumble engine noise.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 100% of the ""wind"" noise! And they also managed to cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise too! Im giving the WF-1000XM5 the lead over the APP2 since I felt that rumble noise was more ""controlled"", and not so loose like the APP2

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

The rumble noise itself of the engine, is 100% cancelled with the QC Ultra, but the ""air / wind"" sound itself, its still audible, aproximately cancelled by about 92.5% maybe, the XM5 ""wind"" nosie is more like a high frecuency wind, while the QC Ultra ""wind"" noise is like a more ""low"" frecuency wind. Its hard to explain, but its what I feel with them, the XM5 feels more like trying to whistle with your mouth, but not whistling, while the Bose feels like a relaxed engine noise without the rumble. Im giving Bose the win here, the rumble engine noise is gone and the wind noise is also cancelled almost perfectly, while yes, its not 100% cancelled like the in-ears, its still not that far and the rumble is completely gone, which is a more noticeable thing imo.

**Test 3 (Office /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sQXSdzk6U4&t=2456s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 cancelled about 87.5% of the sudden voices, about 90% of the keyboard noises, and I noticed a lot of low frecuency sound as background of the officce, the XM5 and the Bose cancelled it 100%, since I didnt even noticed it, but the XM4 create this low frecuency background sound, due to accumulation of sounds maybe, that cancell maybe 75%? Its like the airplane engine rumble lol, a big noticeable step behind on this specific sound, besides this low frecuency sound, they still perform good, but not as good as the XM5 and Bose. Whil yes, they cancell 5% more of the high noises than the in-ears, they are considerable worse on cancelling the sudden voices + they have this ""low"" frecuency sound which is very noticeable.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 cancelled 95% of the sudden voices, the same amount comparing it to the QC Ultra, but cancelled about 85% of the high frecuency noises, like the keyboard noises. Which is weird, watching how well they performed on Test 1 with high noises, but on this test, they didnt do as well. There is not a ""low"" frecuency sound like on the WH-1000XM4 and Momentum 4.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

The APP2, also did a not so good job with the high frecuency noises, like keyboards, they cancelled about 82.5%-85% noise. But when it comes to the sudden voices, they cancelled 97.5%, a tad better than the QC Ultra, to the point i had to focus to hear them. There is no ""low"" frecuency sound here.

**3.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

Surprisingly, the sudden voices were cancelled about 92.5%, yes, the same amount of noise cancelling than the XM5, and I would dare to say that it felt a very little tad quieter than the XM5 (in this specific sound), maybe is the rest of the more noticeable sounds masking it, but it felt quieter. the keyboard typing noises were cancelled about 87.5%, a tad worse than the XM4, and that ""low"" frecuency sound that was really noticeable on the XM4, here is way less, but its still there, maybe 90% cancelled, but not as bad on the XM4, which was about 75% cancelled. Im giving them the lead over the APP2 since they cancell more of the sudden high noises considerably, I prefer cancelling 5% better of those high noises instead of 5% better of those sudden voices, but you may prefer the APP2 if you like better cancelling more of the sudden voices instead of the sudden high noises. The ""low"" frecuency sound is there, but its very less notcieable than the XM4, so its not quite a big issue to me.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

While talking about the sudden high frecuency noises, specially the keyboard noises, I found that the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of those noises, the sudden voices were also cancelled about 92.5% too.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

With the Bose, I found they cancelled about 95% of the sudden voices, and they cancelled 92.5% of the sudden high noises, like the keyboards, just like the XM5.

**Test 4 (Library /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3_eIwDWS_c&t=40s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the background chatter, the chatter felt more ""free"" comparing to the more ""compressed"" and ""trapped"" feeling of the chatter on the XM5. The sudden noises were cancelled about 80%

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The WH-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 90% of the background chatter, yes, the same amount than the XM5. After A/B for several minutes and focusing, I felt that the XM4 chatter felt more ""free"" and the XM5 felt more ""trapped"", while cancelling the same amount. And they cancelled about 85% of the sudden noises, 2.5% worse than the XM5.

**4-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 90% of the background chatter, the Bose got quieter here by a small gap, but noticeable gap. The sudden noises were cancelled about 87.5% on the Sony.

**3-4/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

Surprisingly, the APP2 cancelled 95% of the background chatter, but the sudden noises were cancelled about 80%, a tad worse than the WF-1000XM4. But I would say that the 95% cancelling of the background chatter compensate the sudden noises cancelling.

**2-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

The WF-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 95% of the background chatter. But the sudden noises are more noticeable on the Sony, cancelling aproximately 85%, specially the high noises and pages turnings.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The Bose cancelled about 95% of the background chatter, which is a ""low"" frecuency sound type of feeling, the sudden noises like pages turning or foot steps were cancelled about 90%. Ok, Im giving the win to the Bose here, but its by an absolutely micro difference, I spent about 30m just A/B/C between the Bose, the WF-1000XM4 and the APP2. They all cancelled almost all of the background noise, in occasions I felt that one was better, and in others I felt the others were better. The bose took maybe 5s-10s to completely adapt and then it cancelled at their max potential, I would say that for moments it cancelled 100% of the chatter. The WF-1000XM4 at the start cancelled maybe a tad more than 95% or even 100% of the chatter, but then it dropped to 95%, this might be due the ear tips fit, which is impossible to make them stay still 100% (Already tried all of them). But the high recuency sudden noises cancelling was better on the Bose here. What a competition, It took me a while to choose a winner here.

**Test 5 (Garden /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7qwcrKaUs) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The fountain sound was cancelled about 92.5%, its very reduced, but still there, and the birds noises were cancelled about 75%-80%, the Bose did a better job here, some of the bird noises i heard instantly on the APP2, with the Bose I didnt heard them for the first 2 times, then I focused and then I heard them.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 was able to cancell about 92.5% of the fountain noise, like the XM5. But the XM5 fountain noise felt more ""trapped"", while on the M4 felt more ""free"". The M4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the bird noise, which is a tad better than the WF-1000XM4 and a tad worse than the QC Ultra and XM5.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 managed to cancell 95% of the fountain noise, which is a little better than the APP2 but a little worse than the Bose and WF-1000XM4. The bird noises were cancelled about 85%, which is better than the in-ears, but a tad worse than the Bose.

**3.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

This time the WF-1000XM4 cancelled about 97.5% of the fountain noise, like the QC Ultra, and reduced about 80% of the bird noises, like the APP2. Again, the fountain noise is almost 100% killed, but when pausing / playing the video I could hear a small difference of the fountain noise, being very slightly noticeable when focusing.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the fountain noise, yes, 2.5% worse than the WH-1000XM4, but that might be the XM4 white noise camouflaging the fountain noise itself, but focusing purely on the fountain, the XM5 make it a tad more noticeable. But the bird noises were cancelled about 90%, like the QC Ultra.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The QC Ultra was able to cancell 97.5% of the fountain ""low"" frecuency water noise, the birds were cancelled by about 90%. A pretty good job. The fountain noise itself is almost 100% killed, you will probably dont notice it in a irl situation, I could tell a tiny bit of it was passing the ANC because I could tell a very small difference when pausing the video and putting it again, but again, its almost killed 100% once the ANC adapts after a few seconds.

**Test 6 (Rain /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-__3RANT4) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 90% of the rain noise, like the WH-1000XM4, and was able to cancell about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like all of the other over the ear headphones on the test.

**5.-3.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 was able to cancell 90% of the rain noise, a tad worse than the XM5. And it cancelled about 90% of the drops reaching the ground / water, just like the XM5 and QC Ultra.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the rain noise, and about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like the QC Ultra.

**3.-4.5/5⭐Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The rain itself was cancelled about 97.5%, while the drops touching the ground, probably was cancelled about 85%, not quite as good as the QC Ultra.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra**

95% of the rain itself was cancelled by the Bose, now, the drops touching the ground / water, was cancelled about 90%

**1.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER 🏆)**

The sound of the rain, was cancelled about 97.5%, like the APP2. But the drops touching the ground / water was cancelled about 85%.

**Test 7 (City /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3pj_3mdMc&t=15815s&pp=ygUUYW1iaWVuY2Ugc291bmRzIGNpdHk%3D) **)**

**6.-3/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 cancell about 85% of the background ""low"" noise, while they cancell about 75% of the people voices.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4, just like the XM5, cancell about 92.5% of the background ""low"" noise of the road, and they cancell about 80% of the people voices too.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

These ones cancell about 80% of the voices of the people. While they cancell, again, 92.5% of the ""low"" frecuency background noise, like the rest of this test do.

**3.-5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2 (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" nosie was cancelled by 95%. And the voices of the people ""passing by"" were cancelled by about 87.5%. The 5% remaining of the ""Low"" noise fells like a ""wind / white nosie"" type of noise, while the Bose is a ""light rumble"" type of noise.

**2.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (TIE 🏆)**

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 95% of the ""low"" frecuency noise. While they cancelled about 90% of the voices of the people.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" frecuency noise was cancelled about 95%. While the voices of the people ""passing by"" were reduced aproximately 90%. Alright this is a tie, the 3 headphones blocks the same amounbt of ""Low"" noise and the same amount of voices, like, literally almost 100% the same amount. Sometimes one headphone somehow adapts better and cancells half of a tad more. The APP2 5% remaining ""low"" nosie feels like a wind / light white noise, the 5% remaining of the QC Ultra and WF-XM4 feels like a light rumble of the road. Ill give a tie here, but I would stay with either the WF-XM4 or QC Ultra due I dont like that much the wind / white noise of the APP2 that remains. Tho the QC Ultra has a light white noise always due to ANC, and WF-XM4 requieres a very good seal to cancell properly, which it costs me sometimes. They all have their ""buts"".

  
**Conclusions 🎖️**

The Momentum 4 is a great headphone, but you can tell Sennheiser priority wasnt ANC, they achieve an awesome sound quality, but fall a little short when it comes to ANC and its competitors. While yes, its noticeable worst sometimes against the Bose, Sony and Apple. It isnt complete garbage, it gets the job done enough, at least for me, but there are better options.

The WH-1000XM4 holds very well for being 5 years old, while yes, its a step behind the QC Ultra, APP2 and WF-1000XM4, they are still incredible Noise cancelling headphones, surpasing almost everytime the Momentum 4 and being mostly on par with the WH-1000XM5.

The WH-1000XM5 is a slight upgrade from the WH-1000XM4 when it comes to ANC, but its not a huge difference, its Noise Cancelling its superb, but doing A/B testing did let me know that they are half a step behind the leaders here (APP2, WF-XM4 and QC Ultra), sometimes being an almost unnoticeable difference and sometimes being noticeable. Moving comparisons aside this is one of the best ANC you can get on a headphone right now.

The Airpods Pro 2 did surprise me a lot, they did match and even slightly surpass sometimes the QC Ultra capabilities when it comes to ANC, specially when it comes to constant noises like roads, rain and chatter. But, they fell significantly short when it came to cancell high frecuency noises, like the ones you find on an office or coffee shop, they are noticeable worst than the QC Ultra or WH-1000XM5, besides that, they do an awesome job and get in the same level of the QC Ultra.

The WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the APP2, but being better cancelling those high frecuency noises considerably, but being very slightly worst sometimes cancelling those constant noises. This ones are on par with the QC Ultra and imo slightly better on most of the occassions against the Airpods Pro 2. But, getting a perfect seal is crucial you have to find the right spor after trying for several time to achieve their 100% ANC capabilities, if not, the ANC will leak and it will not be the same, overall a surprising performance.

The QC Ultra, what would you excpect, Bose created ANC and they have been the kings, or the top 2 since their creation. After intense testing, almost 100% of the times the QC Ultra were very slightly superior than my XM5, they were on par with the APP2 and WF-XM4 cancelling those constant noise, sometimes very slightly worse and sometimes very slightly better, but what they do considerably better, is cancelling those high frecuency noises, sometimes those sounds on the APP2 were noticeable, and with the QC Ultra I would have to focus to pick them up. BUT, yes, there is always a but, they have slight white noise while using the ANC, on loud places it wont be as noticeable, but in some tests that things got very quiet, the white noise was slightly more noticeable. Imo its not bothering at al, but its there, just to let you all know.

Below Ill put the charts which are the gathering of the results we already viewed, and some notes to take in mind, it took me 3 days with very intense A/B testing, but it was fun and entretaining, thanks a lot for reading this! See you on the next time!

I went my entire school career with undiagnosed OCD and Anxiety. I also have a slight physical disability in my right arm that didn't make things easy either. Now, that that's out of the way...

Going into college, (I didn't know it at the time) I stupidly majored in Communications and Journalism. I did everything I was supposed to do. I did clubs, extracurriculars etc. I ended up graduating Summa Cum Laude. I even got a job after graduating, in my field too!

Things took a turn when that dream job became a nightmare. I made less there than at the retail job I’d left. I was overworked, handling the duties of an entire media team while my efforts were constantly scrutinized. I stretched myself to the point of insomnia, stress nosebleeds, and burnout, but somehow, I wasn’t a team player because I couldn’t stretch myself out just *that* much further. 

I eventually left for a more relaxed customer service job, which led to a marketing internship. However, I was frequently pulled away from the internship to cover staffing gaps and help a manager that didn’t know mouse shit from coffee grinds. The promise of a full-time position was dangled over my head, so I figured I’d just embrace the suck for a while. When said full-time position finally came up, I was never notified about it. By the time I applied, it was given to someone else. I took that to mean they had someone else in mind from the get-go. If I did something wrong or was just shit at my job, I wish they would’ve just told me. 

I was expected to just crawl back to the department that overworked me like a good little invertebrate. I put in my two weeks’ notice (with nothing else lined up), so both positions ended at the same time.

Since then, I’ve been working low-paying jobs. I ended up taking a job in a mailroom. It was the only job that said yes to me after months of ""No's"" and I needed the money.

 I spent a year doing an accredited Paralegal certification while working. It honestly hasn’t been worth the time or effort. I called various law firms inquiring about positions, even ones for secretaries, and I was turned down. The one that did have an open position, told me they were looking for someone that was bilingual, on top of having the cert. I almost threw my phone against the wall after the call ended.

So now I’m stuck and all the options seem to lead to more dead ends. I wish I could go back to school, but taking on all that debt after graduating virtually debt-free scares me. 
I could quit my crappy mailroom, but I'd just end up back in retail or customer service again. 
I wish I could join the military, but if my arm doesn't keep me out the anti-depressant surely will. I've officially hit the goddamn wall. ",1,1748806575.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

Headphones Used : Sony WH-1000XM5 / Sony WH-1000XM4 / Sony WF-1000MX4 / Bose QuietComfort Ultra / Apple Airpods Pro 2 / Sennheiser Momentum 4

**Test 1 (Coffee Shop /** [**Video used** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiMXGIG_DQo&t=10360s)**)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

This have astonishing sound quality, but this is not why we are here. The Momentum 4 have a decent ANC, but its noticeable a step behind the competitors. Its like a step behind the XM4, while the XM4 are already a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra. The Momentum 4 cancelled the high frecuency noises very well tho, again, about 85%. But the background chatter was cancelled about 70%, and the sudden loud voices about 70% too. Its ANC is enough, for me atleast, but its not as good as Sony or Bose.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 are basically a step behind the XM5, just like you would excpect, since the XM5 is the direct upgrade from the XM4. The XM4 cancelled less background chatter, comparing it to the XM5 and Bose, the XM4 cancelled about 77.5%, its noticeable but not an absolute enormous gap. The XM4 did cancell very well the sudden loud voices tho. probably 77.5% aproximately, maybe 75%. They did cancell very well the high frecuency noises too, probably 85%, like the Bose. Overall is a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra, but its still an absolute banger for ANC to the date, its just there are better options now.

**4.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Im absolutely surprised here, the Airpods Pro 2 cancelled the background chatter about what? 95%!!?? It absolutely surprised me, they cancelled better than the Bose flagship over the ear headphones, and better than Sony WH-1000XM5! Even the loud sudden voices were cancelled by about 90% ??!! They absolutely smashed it! Tho I musyt say, they did not cancell the high frecuencies very well, comparing to the rest, they probably cancelled about 70%, they felt short in that aspect, but for the voices they absolutely nailed it.

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

With the XM5, the high noises were equally cancelled comparing them to the bose, about 85% probably. Now, the background chatter only, the Sony cancelled about 85% of the background chatter. The sudden kid and loud voices was cancelled by an average of 82.5% probably, a tad worse than the Bose here.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra\*\*

With the Bose QC Ultra (Over the ear), the high frecuency noises like the forks, cups or that sort of stuff, the Bose cancelled it very good, some of the cup noises leaked but very muffled, by average the high frecuency noises were cancelled by about 85%. The background chatter was cancelled by 90% aprox, and the kids or loud sudden voices were cancelled about 85%, overall a pretty awesome job and definetely close to being perfect.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

Im surprised again, the WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the Airpods when it comes to the voices. The background chatter was cancelled by about 92.5%. And the sudden loud voices were cancelled about 85%. Then, they cancelled the high frecuency noises by about 85%!

**Test 2 (Plane Noise /** [**Video used**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEGmghn_jo&t=392s) **)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

The rumble noise on the Momentum 4 was cancelled about 80%-85%, but the ""wind"" noise itself was not as greatly cancelled, it was drained out about 75%, which its a very noticeable downgrade from the 90% of the QC Ultra and XM5.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

These ones, like the in-ear version, also cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, while the ""wind"" noise is cancelled about 90%, like the XM5, the XM4 wind noise is sort of ""low"" frecuency wind, like the QC Ultra, and not like trying to whistle with your mouth, like the XM5. I found that besides the three Sonys cancelling all 92.5% of the rumble noise, the XM5 felt like the noise was a little more controlled, and both the WF and WH XM4 the rumble noise felt a little bit more ""loose"", so I would give the XM5 a very small gap just because of that.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

Here, the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, the ""air / wind"" nosie was cancelled about 90% too

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Just like the WF-1000XM4, I found that they cancelled also 100% of the ""wind"" noise, and 92.5% of the rumble engine noise.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 100% of the ""wind"" noise! And they also managed to cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise too! Im giving the WF-1000XM5 the lead over the APP2 since I felt that rumble noise was more ""controlled"", and not so loose like the APP2

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

The rumble noise itself of the engine, is 100% cancelled with the QC Ultra, but the ""air / wind"" sound itself, its still audible, aproximately cancelled by about 92.5% maybe, the XM5 ""wind"" nosie is more like a high frecuency wind, while the QC Ultra ""wind"" noise is like a more ""low"" frecuency wind. Its hard to explain, but its what I feel with them, the XM5 feels more like trying to whistle with your mouth, but not whistling, while the Bose feels like a relaxed engine noise without the rumble. Im giving Bose the win here, the rumble engine noise is gone and the wind noise is also cancelled almost perfectly, while yes, its not 100% cancelled like the in-ears, its still not that far and the rumble is completely gone, which is a more noticeable thing imo.

**Test 3 (Office /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sQXSdzk6U4&t=2456s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 cancelled about 87.5% of the sudden voices, about 90% of the keyboard noises, and I noticed a lot of low frecuency sound as background of the officce, the XM5 and the Bose cancelled it 100%, since I didnt even noticed it, but the XM4 create this low frecuency background sound, due to accumulation of sounds maybe, that cancell maybe 75%? Its like the airplane engine rumble lol, a big noticeable step behind on this specific sound, besides this low frecuency sound, they still perform good, but not as good as the XM5 and Bose. Whil yes, they cancell 5% more of the high noises than the in-ears, they are considerable worse on cancelling the sudden voices + they have this ""low"" frecuency sound which is very noticeable.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 cancelled 95% of the sudden voices, the same amount comparing it to the QC Ultra, but cancelled about 85% of the high frecuency noises, like the keyboard noises. Which is weird, watching how well they performed on Test 1 with high noises, but on this test, they didnt do as well. There is not a ""low"" frecuency sound like on the WH-1000XM4 and Momentum 4.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

The APP2, also did a not so good job with the high frecuency noises, like keyboards, they cancelled about 82.5%-85% noise. But when it comes to the sudden voices, they cancelled 97.5%, a tad better than the QC Ultra, to the point i had to focus to hear them. There is no ""low"" frecuency sound here.

**3.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

Surprisingly, the sudden voices were cancelled about 92.5%, yes, the same amount of noise cancelling than the XM5, and I would dare to say that it felt a very little tad quieter than the XM5 (in this specific sound), maybe is the rest of the more noticeable sounds masking it, but it felt quieter. the keyboard typing noises were cancelled about 87.5%, a tad worse than the XM4, and that ""low"" frecuency sound that was really noticeable on the XM4, here is way less, but its still there, maybe 90% cancelled, but not as bad on the XM4, which was about 75% cancelled. Im giving them the lead over the APP2 since they cancell more of the sudden high noises considerably, I prefer cancelling 5% better of those high noises instead of 5% better of those sudden voices, but you may prefer the APP2 if you like better cancelling more of the sudden voices instead of the sudden high noises. The ""low"" frecuency sound is there, but its very less notcieable than the XM4, so its not quite a big issue to me.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

While talking about the sudden high frecuency noises, specially the keyboard noises, I found that the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of those noises, the sudden voices were also cancelled about 92.5% too.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

With the Bose, I found they cancelled about 95% of the sudden voices, and they cancelled 92.5% of the sudden high noises, like the keyboards, just like the XM5.

**Test 4 (Library /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3_eIwDWS_c&t=40s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the background chatter, the chatter felt more ""free"" comparing to the more ""compressed"" and ""trapped"" feeling of the chatter on the XM5. The sudden noises were cancelled about 80%

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The WH-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 90% of the background chatter, yes, the same amount than the XM5. After A/B for several minutes and focusing, I felt that the XM4 chatter felt more ""free"" and the XM5 felt more ""trapped"", while cancelling the same amount. And they cancelled about 85% of the sudden noises, 2.5% worse than the XM5.

**4-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 90% of the background chatter, the Bose got quieter here by a small gap, but noticeable gap. The sudden noises were cancelled about 87.5% on the Sony.

**3-4/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

Surprisingly, the APP2 cancelled 95% of the background chatter, but the sudden noises were cancelled about 80%, a tad worse than the WF-1000XM4. But I would say that the 95% cancelling of the background chatter compensate the sudden noises cancelling.

**2-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

The WF-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 95% of the background chatter. But the sudden noises are more noticeable on the Sony, cancelling aproximately 85%, specially the high noises and pages turnings.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The Bose cancelled about 95% of the background chatter, which is a ""low"" frecuency sound type of feeling, the sudden noises like pages turning or foot steps were cancelled about 90%. Ok, Im giving the win to the Bose here, but its by an absolutely micro difference, I spent about 30m just A/B/C between the Bose, the WF-1000XM4 and the APP2. They all cancelled almost all of the background noise, in occasions I felt that one was better, and in others I felt the others were better. The bose took maybe 5s-10s to completely adapt and then it cancelled at their max potential, I would say that for moments it cancelled 100% of the chatter. The WF-1000XM4 at the start cancelled maybe a tad more than 95% or even 100% of the chatter, but then it dropped to 95%, this might be due the ear tips fit, which is impossible to make them stay still 100% (Already tried all of them). But the high recuency sudden noises cancelling was better on the Bose here. What a competition, It took me a while to choose a winner here.

**Test 5 (Garden /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7qwcrKaUs) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The fountain sound was cancelled about 92.5%, its very reduced, but still there, and the birds noises were cancelled about 75%-80%, the Bose did a better job here, some of the bird noises i heard instantly on the APP2, with the Bose I didnt heard them for the first 2 times, then I focused and then I heard them.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 was able to cancell about 92.5% of the fountain noise, like the XM5. But the XM5 fountain noise felt more ""trapped"", while on the M4 felt more ""free"". The M4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the bird noise, which is a tad better than the WF-1000XM4 and a tad worse than the QC Ultra and XM5.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 managed to cancell 95% of the fountain noise, which is a little better than the APP2 but a little worse than the Bose and WF-1000XM4. The bird noises were cancelled about 85%, which is better than the in-ears, but a tad worse than the Bose.

**3.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

This time the WF-1000XM4 cancelled about 97.5% of the fountain noise, like the QC Ultra, and reduced about 80% of the bird noises, like the APP2. Again, the fountain noise is almost 100% killed, but when pausing / playing the video I could hear a small difference of the fountain noise, being very slightly noticeable when focusing.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the fountain noise, yes, 2.5% worse than the WH-1000XM4, but that might be the XM4 white noise camouflaging the fountain noise itself, but focusing purely on the fountain, the XM5 make it a tad more noticeable. But the bird noises were cancelled about 90%, like the QC Ultra.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The QC Ultra was able to cancell 97.5% of the fountain ""low"" frecuency water noise, the birds were cancelled by about 90%. A pretty good job. The fountain noise itself is almost 100% killed, you will probably dont notice it in a irl situation, I could tell a tiny bit of it was passing the ANC because I could tell a very small difference when pausing the video and putting it again, but again, its almost killed 100% once the ANC adapts after a few seconds.

**Test 6 (Rain /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-__3RANT4) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 90% of the rain noise, like the WH-1000XM4, and was able to cancell about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like all of the other over the ear headphones on the test.

**5.-3.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 was able to cancell 90% of the rain noise, a tad worse than the XM5. And it cancelled about 90% of the drops reaching the ground / water, just like the XM5 and QC Ultra.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the rain noise, and about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like the QC Ultra.

**3.-4.5/5⭐Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The rain itself was cancelled about 97.5%, while the drops touching the ground, probably was cancelled about 85%, not quite as good as the QC Ultra.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra**

95% of the rain itself was cancelled by the Bose, now, the drops touching the ground / water, was cancelled about 90%

**1.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER 🏆)**

The sound of the rain, was cancelled about 97.5%, like the APP2. But the drops touching the ground / water was cancelled about 85%.

**Test 7 (City /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3pj_3mdMc&t=15815s&pp=ygUUYW1iaWVuY2Ugc291bmRzIGNpdHk%3D) **)**

**6.-3/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 cancell about 85% of the background ""low"" noise, while they cancell about 75% of the people voices.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4, just like the XM5, cancell about 92.5% of the background ""low"" noise of the road, and they cancell about 80% of the people voices too.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

These ones cancell about 80% of the voices of the people. While they cancell, again, 92.5% of the ""low"" frecuency background noise, like the rest of this test do.

**3.-5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2 (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" nosie was cancelled by 95%. And the voices of the people ""passing by"" were cancelled by about 87.5%. The 5% remaining of the ""Low"" noise fells like a ""wind / white nosie"" type of noise, while the Bose is a ""light rumble"" type of noise.

**2.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (TIE 🏆)**

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 95% of the ""low"" frecuency noise. While they cancelled about 90% of the voices of the people.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" frecuency noise was cancelled about 95%. While the voices of the people ""passing by"" were reduced aproximately 90%. Alright this is a tie, the 3 headphones blocks the same amounbt of ""Low"" noise and the same amount of voices, like, literally almost 100% the same amount. Sometimes one headphone somehow adapts better and cancells half of a tad more. The APP2 5% remaining ""low"" nosie feels like a wind / light white noise, the 5% remaining of the QC Ultra and WF-XM4 feels like a light rumble of the road. Ill give a tie here, but I would stay with either the WF-XM4 or QC Ultra due I dont like that much the wind / white noise of the APP2 that remains. Tho the QC Ultra has a light white noise always due to ANC, and WF-XM4 requieres a very good seal to cancell properly, which it costs me sometimes. They all have their ""buts"".

  
**Conclusions 🎖️**

The Momentum 4 is a great headphone, but you can tell Sennheiser priority wasnt ANC, they achieve an awesome sound quality, but fall a little short when it comes to ANC and its competitors. While yes, its noticeable worst sometimes against the Bose, Sony and Apple. It isnt complete garbage, it gets the job done enough, at least for me, but there are better options.

The WH-1000XM4 holds very well for being 5 years old, while yes, its a step behind the QC Ultra, APP2 and WF-1000XM4, they are still incredible Noise cancelling headphones, surpasing almost everytime the Momentum 4 and being mostly on par with the WH-1000XM5.

The WH-1000XM5 is a slight upgrade from the WH-1000XM4 when it comes to ANC, but its not a huge difference, its Noise Cancelling its superb, but doing A/B testing did let me know that they are half a step behind the leaders here (APP2, WF-XM4 and QC Ultra), sometimes being an almost unnoticeable difference and sometimes being noticeable. Moving comparisons aside this is one of the best ANC you can get on a headphone right now.

The Airpods Pro 2 did surprise me a lot, they did match and even slightly surpass sometimes the QC Ultra capabilities when it comes to ANC, specially when it comes to constant noises like roads, rain and chatter. But, they fell significantly short when it came to cancell high frecuency noises, like the ones you find on an office or coffee shop, they are noticeable worst than the QC Ultra or WH-1000XM5, besides that, they do an awesome job and get in the same level of the QC Ultra.

The WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the APP2, but being better cancelling those high frecuency noises considerably, but being very slightly worst sometimes cancelling those constant noises. This ones are on par with the QC Ultra and imo slightly better on most of the occassions against the Airpods Pro 2. But, getting a perfect seal is crucial you have to find the right spor after trying for several time to achieve their 100% ANC capabilities, if not, the ANC will leak and it will not be the same, overall a surprising performance.

The QC Ultra, what would you excpect, Bose created ANC and they have been the kings, or the top 2 since their creation. After intense testing, almost 100% of the times the QC Ultra were very slightly superior than my XM5, they were on par with the APP2 and WF-XM4 cancelling those constant noise, sometimes very slightly worse and sometimes very slightly better, but what they do considerably better, is cancelling those high frecuency noises, sometimes those sounds on the APP2 were noticeable, and with the QC Ultra I would have to focus to pick them up. BUT, yes, there is always a but, they have slight white noise while using the ANC, on loud places it wont be as noticeable, but in some tests that things got very quiet, the white noise was slightly more noticeable. Imo its not bothering at al, but its there, just to let you all know.

Below Ill put the charts which are the gathering of the results we already viewed, and some notes to take in mind, it took me 3 days with very intense A/B testing, but it was fun and entretaining, thanks a lot for reading this! See you on the next time!

**NOTES** 📝

\-The charts are the gathering of the results made on the A/B testing, they are not charts from internet or objective measurments

\-The % wont be 100% accurate to reality, I took them as reference or as a stand point to then calculate how much % would the others get, it may be lower / higher depdening on the situation you are.

\-ANC performance also depends highly of how much of a good seal you get with your headphones, if you wear glasses or if the ear tips of the in-ear dont fit on you, the ANC performance might be lowered.

\-The QC Ultra and WH-1000XM4 have slight white noise when using ANC on a quiet place, in most of loud places you wont hear it at all. On the APP2, WF-1000XM4, WH-1000XM5 and Momentum 4 I couldnt find any white noise on ANC while on a quiet place.

\-This was obtained by an A/B long testing, I did not base myself on any online charts or objective stats measurments on internet. This was pure listening and focusing on which cancelled more noise than the other.

\-Yes, I actually did this because I got bored, this is completely done by hand and tested one by one by me, it just entretains me and its nice to see which headphone is better cancelling some sounds and worse while cancelling others, its fun, at least for me...",3,1748806533.0,airpods,0,1.0,False

Headphones Used : Sony WH-1000XM5 / Sony WH-1000XM4 / Sony WF-1000MX4 / Bose QuietComfort Ultra / Apple Airpods Pro 2 / Sennheiser Momentum 4

**Test 1 (Coffee Shop /** [**Video used** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiMXGIG_DQo&t=10360s)**)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

This have astonishing sound quality, but this is not why we are here. The Momentum 4 have a decent ANC, but its noticeable a step behind the competitors. Its like a step behind the XM4, while the XM4 are already a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra. The Momentum 4 cancelled the high frecuency noises very well tho, again, about 85%. But the background chatter was cancelled about 70%, and the sudden loud voices about 70% too. Its ANC is enough, for me atleast, but its not as good as Sony or Bose.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 are basically a step behind the XM5, just like you would excpect, since the XM5 is the direct upgrade from the XM4. The XM4 cancelled less background chatter, comparing it to the XM5 and Bose, the XM4 cancelled about 77.5%, its noticeable but not an absolute enormous gap. The XM4 did cancell very well the sudden loud voices tho. probably 77.5% aproximately, maybe 75%. They did cancell very well the high frecuency noises too, probably 85%, like the Bose. Overall is a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra, but its still an absolute banger for ANC to the date, its just there are better options now.

**4.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Im absolutely surprised here, the Airpods Pro 2 cancelled the background chatter about what? 95%!!?? It absolutely surprised me, they cancelled better than the Bose flagship over the ear headphones, and better than Sony WH-1000XM5! Even the loud sudden voices were cancelled by about 90% ??!! They absolutely smashed it! Tho I musyt say, they did not cancell the high frecuencies very well, comparing to the rest, they probably cancelled about 70%, they felt short in that aspect, but for the voices they absolutely nailed it.

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

With the XM5, the high noises were equally cancelled comparing them to the bose, about 85% probably. Now, the background chatter only, the Sony cancelled about 85% of the background chatter. The sudden kid and loud voices was cancelled by an average of 82.5% probably, a tad worse than the Bose here.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra\*\*

With the Bose QC Ultra (Over the ear), the high frecuency noises like the forks, cups or that sort of stuff, the Bose cancelled it very good, some of the cup noises leaked but very muffled, by average the high frecuency noises were cancelled by about 85%. The background chatter was cancelled by 90% aprox, and the kids or loud sudden voices were cancelled about 85%, overall a pretty awesome job and definetely close to being perfect.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

Im surprised again, the WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the Airpods when it comes to the voices. The background chatter was cancelled by about 92.5%. And the sudden loud voices were cancelled about 85%. Then, they cancelled the high frecuency noises by about 85%!

**Test 2 (Plane Noise /** [**Video used**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEGmghn_jo&t=392s) **)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

The rumble noise on the Momentum 4 was cancelled about 80%-85%, but the ""wind"" noise itself was not as greatly cancelled, it was drained out about 75%, which its a very noticeable downgrade from the 90% of the QC Ultra and XM5.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

These ones, like the in-ear version, also cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, while the ""wind"" noise is cancelled about 90%, like the XM5, the XM4 wind noise is sort of ""low"" frecuency wind, like the QC Ultra, and not like trying to whistle with your mouth, like the XM5. I found that besides the three Sonys cancelling all 92.5% of the rumble noise, the XM5 felt like the noise was a little more controlled, and both the WF and WH XM4 the rumble noise felt a little bit more ""loose"", so I would give the XM5 a very small gap just because of that.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

Here, the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, the ""air / wind"" nosie was cancelled about 90% too

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Just like the WF-1000XM4, I found that they cancelled also 100% of the ""wind"" noise, and 92.5% of the rumble engine noise.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 100% of the ""wind"" noise! And they also managed to cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise too! Im giving the WF-1000XM5 the lead over the APP2 since I felt that rumble noise was more ""controlled"", and not so loose like the APP2

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

The rumble noise itself of the engine, is 100% cancelled with the QC Ultra, but the ""air / wind"" sound itself, its still audible, aproximately cancelled by about 92.5% maybe, the XM5 ""wind"" nosie is more like a high frecuency wind, while the QC Ultra ""wind"" noise is like a more ""low"" frecuency wind. Its hard to explain, but its what I feel with them, the XM5 feels more like trying to whistle with your mouth, but not whistling, while the Bose feels like a relaxed engine noise without the rumble. Im giving Bose the win here, the rumble engine noise is gone and the wind noise is also cancelled almost perfectly, while yes, its not 100% cancelled like the in-ears, its still not that far and the rumble is completely gone, which is a more noticeable thing imo.

**Test 3 (Office /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sQXSdzk6U4&t=2456s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 cancelled about 87.5% of the sudden voices, about 90% of the keyboard noises, and I noticed a lot of low frecuency sound as background of the officce, the XM5 and the Bose cancelled it 100%, since I didnt even noticed it, but the XM4 create this low frecuency background sound, due to accumulation of sounds maybe, that cancell maybe 75%? Its like the airplane engine rumble lol, a big noticeable step behind on this specific sound, besides this low frecuency sound, they still perform good, but not as good as the XM5 and Bose. Whil yes, they cancell 5% more of the high noises than the in-ears, they are considerable worse on cancelling the sudden voices + they have this ""low"" frecuency sound which is very noticeable.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 cancelled 95% of the sudden voices, the same amount comparing it to the QC Ultra, but cancelled about 85% of the high frecuency noises, like the keyboard noises. Which is weird, watching how well they performed on Test 1 with high noises, but on this test, they didnt do as well. There is not a ""low"" frecuency sound like on the WH-1000XM4 and Momentum 4.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

The APP2, also did a not so good job with the high frecuency noises, like keyboards, they cancelled about 82.5%-85% noise. But when it comes to the sudden voices, they cancelled 97.5%, a tad better than the QC Ultra, to the point i had to focus to hear them. There is no ""low"" frecuency sound here.

**3.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

Surprisingly, the sudden voices were cancelled about 92.5%, yes, the same amount of noise cancelling than the XM5, and I would dare to say that it felt a very little tad quieter than the XM5 (in this specific sound), maybe is the rest of the more noticeable sounds masking it, but it felt quieter. the keyboard typing noises were cancelled about 87.5%, a tad worse than the XM4, and that ""low"" frecuency sound that was really noticeable on the XM4, here is way less, but its still there, maybe 90% cancelled, but not as bad on the XM4, which was about 75% cancelled. Im giving them the lead over the APP2 since they cancell more of the sudden high noises considerably, I prefer cancelling 5% better of those high noises instead of 5% better of those sudden voices, but you may prefer the APP2 if you like better cancelling more of the sudden voices instead of the sudden high noises. The ""low"" frecuency sound is there, but its very less notcieable than the XM4, so its not quite a big issue to me.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

While talking about the sudden high frecuency noises, specially the keyboard noises, I found that the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of those noises, the sudden voices were also cancelled about 92.5% too.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

With the Bose, I found they cancelled about 95% of the sudden voices, and they cancelled 92.5% of the sudden high noises, like the keyboards, just like the XM5.

**Test 4 (Library /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3_eIwDWS_c&t=40s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the background chatter, the chatter felt more ""free"" comparing to the more ""compressed"" and ""trapped"" feeling of the chatter on the XM5. The sudden noises were cancelled about 80%

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The WH-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 90% of the background chatter, yes, the same amount than the XM5. After A/B for several minutes and focusing, I felt that the XM4 chatter felt more ""free"" and the XM5 felt more ""trapped"", while cancelling the same amount. And they cancelled about 85% of the sudden noises, 2.5% worse than the XM5.

**4-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 90% of the background chatter, the Bose got quieter here by a small gap, but noticeable gap. The sudden noises were cancelled about 87.5% on the Sony.

**3-4/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

Surprisingly, the APP2 cancelled 95% of the background chatter, but the sudden noises were cancelled about 80%, a tad worse than the WF-1000XM4. But I would say that the 95% cancelling of the background chatter compensate the sudden noises cancelling.

**2-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

The WF-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 95% of the background chatter. But the sudden noises are more noticeable on the Sony, cancelling aproximately 85%, specially the high noises and pages turnings.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The Bose cancelled about 95% of the background chatter, which is a ""low"" frecuency sound type of feeling, the sudden noises like pages turning or foot steps were cancelled about 90%. Ok, Im giving the win to the Bose here, but its by an absolutely micro difference, I spent about 30m just A/B/C between the Bose, the WF-1000XM4 and the APP2. They all cancelled almost all of the background noise, in occasions I felt that one was better, and in others I felt the others were better. The bose took maybe 5s-10s to completely adapt and then it cancelled at their max potential, I would say that for moments it cancelled 100% of the chatter. The WF-1000XM4 at the start cancelled maybe a tad more than 95% or even 100% of the chatter, but then it dropped to 95%, this might be due the ear tips fit, which is impossible to make them stay still 100% (Already tried all of them). But the high recuency sudden noises cancelling was better on the Bose here. What a competition, It took me a while to choose a winner here.

**Test 5 (Garden /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7qwcrKaUs) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The fountain sound was cancelled about 92.5%, its very reduced, but still there, and the birds noises were cancelled about 75%-80%, the Bose did a better job here, some of the bird noises i heard instantly on the APP2, with the Bose I didnt heard them for the first 2 times, then I focused and then I heard them.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 was able to cancell about 92.5% of the fountain noise, like the XM5. But the XM5 fountain noise felt more ""trapped"", while on the M4 felt more ""free"". The M4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the bird noise, which is a tad better than the WF-1000XM4 and a tad worse than the QC Ultra and XM5.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 managed to cancell 95% of the fountain noise, which is a little better than the APP2 but a little worse than the Bose and WF-1000XM4. The bird noises were cancelled about 85%, which is better than the in-ears, but a tad worse than the Bose.

**3.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

This time the WF-1000XM4 cancelled about 97.5% of the fountain noise, like the QC Ultra, and reduced about 80% of the bird noises, like the APP2. Again, the fountain noise is almost 100% killed, but when pausing / playing the video I could hear a small difference of the fountain noise, being very slightly noticeable when focusing.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the fountain noise, yes, 2.5% worse than the WH-1000XM4, but that might be the XM4 white noise camouflaging the fountain noise itself, but focusing purely on the fountain, the XM5 make it a tad more noticeable. But the bird noises were cancelled about 90%, like the QC Ultra.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The QC Ultra was able to cancell 97.5% of the fountain ""low"" frecuency water noise, the birds were cancelled by about 90%. A pretty good job. The fountain noise itself is almost 100% killed, you will probably dont notice it in a irl situation, I could tell a tiny bit of it was passing the ANC because I could tell a very small difference when pausing the video and putting it again, but again, its almost killed 100% once the ANC adapts after a few seconds.

**Test 6 (Rain /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-__3RANT4) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 90% of the rain noise, like the WH-1000XM4, and was able to cancell about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like all of the other over the ear headphones on the test.

**5.-3.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 was able to cancell 90% of the rain noise, a tad worse than the XM5. And it cancelled about 90% of the drops reaching the ground / water, just like the XM5 and QC Ultra.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the rain noise, and about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like the QC Ultra.

**3.-4.5/5⭐Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The rain itself was cancelled about 97.5%, while the drops touching the ground, probably was cancelled about 85%, not quite as good as the QC Ultra.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra**

95% of the rain itself was cancelled by the Bose, now, the drops touching the ground / water, was cancelled about 90%

**1.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER 🏆)**

The sound of the rain, was cancelled about 97.5%, like the APP2. But the drops touching the ground / water was cancelled about 85%.

**Test 7 (City /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3pj_3mdMc&t=15815s&pp=ygUUYW1iaWVuY2Ugc291bmRzIGNpdHk%3D) **)**

**6.-3/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 cancell about 85% of the background ""low"" noise, while they cancell about 75% of the people voices.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4, just like the XM5, cancell about 92.5% of the background ""low"" noise of the road, and they cancell about 80% of the people voices too.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

These ones cancell about 80% of the voices of the people. While they cancell, again, 92.5% of the ""low"" frecuency background noise, like the rest of this test do.

**3.-5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2 (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" nosie was cancelled by 95%. And the voices of the people ""passing by"" were cancelled by about 87.5%. The 5% remaining of the ""Low"" noise fells like a ""wind / white nosie"" type of noise, while the Bose is a ""light rumble"" type of noise.

**2.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (TIE 🏆)**

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 95% of the ""low"" frecuency noise. While they cancelled about 90% of the voices of the people.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" frecuency noise was cancelled about 95%. While the voices of the people ""passing by"" were reduced aproximately 90%. Alright this is a tie, the 3 headphones blocks the same amounbt of ""Low"" noise and the same amount of voices, like, literally almost 100% the same amount. Sometimes one headphone somehow adapts better and cancells half of a tad more. The APP2 5% remaining ""low"" nosie feels like a wind / light white noise, the 5% remaining of the QC Ultra and WF-XM4 feels like a light rumble of the road. Ill give a tie here, but I would stay with either the WF-XM4 or QC Ultra due I dont like that much the wind / white noise of the APP2 that remains. Tho the QC Ultra has a light white noise always due to ANC, and WF-XM4 requieres a very good seal to cancell properly, which it costs me sometimes. They all have their ""buts"".

  
**Conclusions 🎖️**

The Momentum 4 is a great headphone, but you can tell Sennheiser priority wasnt ANC, they achieve an awesome sound quality, but fall a little short when it comes to ANC and its competitors. While yes, its noticeable worst sometimes against the Bose, Sony and Apple. It isnt complete garbage, it gets the job done enough, at least for me, but there are better options.

The WH-1000XM4 holds very well for being 5 years old, while yes, its a step behind the QC Ultra, APP2 and WF-1000XM4, they are still incredible Noise cancelling headphones, surpasing almost everytime the Momentum 4 and being mostly on par with the WH-1000XM5.

The WH-1000XM5 is a slight upgrade from the WH-1000XM4 when it comes to ANC, but its not a huge difference, its Noise Cancelling its superb, but doing A/B testing did let me know that they are half a step behind the leaders here (APP2, WF-XM4 and QC Ultra), sometimes being an almost unnoticeable difference and sometimes being noticeable. Moving comparisons aside this is one of the best ANC you can get on a headphone right now.

The Airpods Pro 2 did surprise me a lot, they did match and even slightly surpass sometimes the QC Ultra capabilities when it comes to ANC, specially when it comes to constant noises like roads, rain and chatter. But, they fell significantly short when it came to cancell high frecuency noises, like the ones you find on an office or coffee shop, they are noticeable worst than the QC Ultra or WH-1000XM5, besides that, they do an awesome job and get in the same level of the QC Ultra.

The WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the APP2, but being better cancelling those high frecuency noises considerably, but being very slightly worst sometimes cancelling those constant noises. This ones are on par with the QC Ultra and imo slightly better on most of the occassions against the Airpods Pro 2. But, getting a perfect seal is crucial you have to find the right spor after trying for several time to achieve their 100% ANC capabilities, if not, the ANC will leak and it will not be the same, overall a surprising performance.

The QC Ultra, what would you excpect, Bose created ANC and they have been the kings, or the top 2 since their creation. After intense testing, almost 100% of the times the QC Ultra were very slightly superior than my XM5, they were on par with the APP2 and WF-XM4 cancelling those constant noise, sometimes very slightly worse and sometimes very slightly better, but what they do considerably better, is cancelling those high frecuency noises, sometimes those sounds on the APP2 were noticeable, and with the QC Ultra I would have to focus to pick them up. BUT, yes, there is always a but, they have slight white noise while using the ANC, on loud places it wont be as noticeable, but in some tests that things got very quiet, the white noise was slightly more noticeable. Imo its not bothering at al, but its there, just to let you all know.

Below Ill put the charts which are the gathering of the results we already viewed, and some notes to take in mind, it took me 3 days with very intense A/B testing, but it was fun and entretaining, thanks a lot for reading this! See you on the next time!

\-The charts are the gathering of the results made on the A/B testing, they are not charts from internet or objective measurments

\-The % wont be 100% accurate to reality, I took them as reference or as a stand point to then calculate how much % would the others get, it may be lower / higher depdening on the situation you are.

\-ANC performance also depends highly of how much of a good seal you get with your headphones, if you wear glasses or if the ear tips of the in-ear dont fit on you, the ANC performance might be lowered.

\-The QC Ultra and WH-1000XM4 have slight white noise when using ANC on a quiet place, in most of loud places you wont hear it at all. On the APP2, WF-1000XM4, WH-1000XM5 and Momentum 4 I couldnt find any white noise on ANC while on a quiet place.

\-This was obtained by an A/B long testing, I did not base myself on any online charts or objective stats measurments on internet. This was pure listening and focusing on which cancelled more noise than the other.

\-Yes, I actually did this because I got bored, this is completely done by hand and tested one by one by me, it just entretains me and its nice to see which headphone is better cancelling some sounds and worse while cancelling others, its fun, at least for me...",7,1748806497.0,sennheiser,1,1.0,False

Nothing brings me joy. I am going to talk to my psychiatrist about this because it’s seriously making it hard to live.

My dad passed away suddenly last Memorial Day, I’m 26 and feel like I’m 80 

I used to find the world beautiful and full of magic and now I think it’s all a sham and a lie and that life is just a trick the universe plays on us. I used to want to see the world and travel and meet new people and now it seems like the worst possible thing to get too invested in this life and that caring is dangerous and brings suffering.

Headphones Used : Sony WH-1000XM5 / Sony WH-1000XM4 / Sony WF-1000MX4 / Bose QuietComfort Ultra / Apple Airpods Pro 2 / Sennheiser Momentum 4

**Test 1 (Coffee Shop /** [**Video used** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiMXGIG_DQo&t=10360s)**)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

This have astonishing sound quality, but this is not why we are here. The Momentum 4 have a decent ANC, but its noticeable a step behind the competitors. Its like a step behind the XM4, while the XM4 are already a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra. The Momentum 4 cancelled the high frecuency noises very well tho, again, about 85%. But the background chatter was cancelled about 70%, and the sudden loud voices about 70% too. Its ANC is enough, for me atleast, but its not as good as Sony or Bose.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 are basically a step behind the XM5, just like you would excpect, since the XM5 is the direct upgrade from the XM4. The XM4 cancelled less background chatter, comparing it to the XM5 and Bose, the XM4 cancelled about 77.5%, its noticeable but not an absolute enormous gap. The XM4 did cancell very well the sudden loud voices tho. probably 77.5% aproximately, maybe 75%. They did cancell very well the high frecuency noises too, probably 85%, like the Bose. Overall is a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra, but its still an absolute banger for ANC to the date, its just there are better options now.

**4.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Im absolutely surprised here, the Airpods Pro 2 cancelled the background chatter about what? 95%!!?? It absolutely surprised me, they cancelled better than the Bose flagship over the ear headphones, and better than Sony WH-1000XM5! Even the loud sudden voices were cancelled by about 90% ??!! They absolutely smashed it! Tho I musyt say, they did not cancell the high frecuencies very well, comparing to the rest, they probably cancelled about 70%, they felt short in that aspect, but for the voices they absolutely nailed it.

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

With the XM5, the high noises were equally cancelled comparing them to the bose, about 85% probably. Now, the background chatter only, the Sony cancelled about 85% of the background chatter. The sudden kid and loud voices was cancelled by an average of 82.5% probably, a tad worse than the Bose here.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra\*\*

With the Bose QC Ultra (Over the ear), the high frecuency noises like the forks, cups or that sort of stuff, the Bose cancelled it very good, some of the cup noises leaked but very muffled, by average the high frecuency noises were cancelled by about 85%. The background chatter was cancelled by 90% aprox, and the kids or loud sudden voices were cancelled about 85%, overall a pretty awesome job and definetely close to being perfect.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

Im surprised again, the WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the Airpods when it comes to the voices. The background chatter was cancelled by about 92.5%. And the sudden loud voices were cancelled about 85%. Then, they cancelled the high frecuency noises by about 85%!

**Test 2 (Plane Noise /** [**Video used**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEGmghn_jo&t=392s) **)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

The rumble noise on the Momentum 4 was cancelled about 80%-85%, but the ""wind"" noise itself was not as greatly cancelled, it was drained out about 75%, which its a very noticeable downgrade from the 90% of the QC Ultra and XM5.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

These ones, like the in-ear version, also cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, while the ""wind"" noise is cancelled about 90%, like the XM5, the XM4 wind noise is sort of ""low"" frecuency wind, like the QC Ultra, and not like trying to whistle with your mouth, like the XM5. I found that besides the three Sonys cancelling all 92.5% of the rumble noise, the XM5 felt like the noise was a little more controlled, and both the WF and WH XM4 the rumble noise felt a little bit more ""loose"", so I would give the XM5 a very small gap just because of that.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

Here, the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, the ""air / wind"" nosie was cancelled about 90% too

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Just like the WF-1000XM4, I found that they cancelled also 100% of the ""wind"" noise, and 92.5% of the rumble engine noise.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 100% of the ""wind"" noise! And they also managed to cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise too! Im giving the WF-1000XM5 the lead over the APP2 since I felt that rumble noise was more ""controlled"", and not so loose like the APP2

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

The rumble noise itself of the engine, is 100% cancelled with the QC Ultra, but the ""air / wind"" sound itself, its still audible, aproximately cancelled by about 92.5% maybe, the XM5 ""wind"" nosie is more like a high frecuency wind, while the QC Ultra ""wind"" noise is like a more ""low"" frecuency wind. Its hard to explain, but its what I feel with them, the XM5 feels more like trying to whistle with your mouth, but not whistling, while the Bose feels like a relaxed engine noise without the rumble. Im giving Bose the win here, the rumble engine noise is gone and the wind noise is also cancelled almost perfectly, while yes, its not 100% cancelled like the in-ears, its still not that far and the rumble is completely gone, which is a more noticeable thing imo.

**Test 3 (Office /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sQXSdzk6U4&t=2456s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 cancelled about 87.5% of the sudden voices, about 90% of the keyboard noises, and I noticed a lot of low frecuency sound as background of the officce, the XM5 and the Bose cancelled it 100%, since I didnt even noticed it, but the XM4 create this low frecuency background sound, due to accumulation of sounds maybe, that cancell maybe 75%? Its like the airplane engine rumble lol, a big noticeable step behind on this specific sound, besides this low frecuency sound, they still perform good, but not as good as the XM5 and Bose. Whil yes, they cancell 5% more of the high noises than the in-ears, they are considerable worse on cancelling the sudden voices + they have this ""low"" frecuency sound which is very noticeable.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 cancelled 95% of the sudden voices, the same amount comparing it to the QC Ultra, but cancelled about 85% of the high frecuency noises, like the keyboard noises. Which is weird, watching how well they performed on Test 1 with high noises, but on this test, they didnt do as well. There is not a ""low"" frecuency sound like on the WH-1000XM4 and Momentum 4.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

The APP2, also did a not so good job with the high frecuency noises, like keyboards, they cancelled about 82.5%-85% noise. But when it comes to the sudden voices, they cancelled 97.5%, a tad better than the QC Ultra, to the point i had to focus to hear them. There is no ""low"" frecuency sound here.

**3.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

Surprisingly, the sudden voices were cancelled about 92.5%, yes, the same amount of noise cancelling than the XM5, and I would dare to say that it felt a very little tad quieter than the XM5 (in this specific sound), maybe is the rest of the more noticeable sounds masking it, but it felt quieter. the keyboard typing noises were cancelled about 87.5%, a tad worse than the XM4, and that ""low"" frecuency sound that was really noticeable on the XM4, here is way less, but its still there, maybe 90% cancelled, but not as bad on the XM4, which was about 75% cancelled. Im giving them the lead over the APP2 since they cancell more of the sudden high noises considerably, I prefer cancelling 5% better of those high noises instead of 5% better of those sudden voices, but you may prefer the APP2 if you like better cancelling more of the sudden voices instead of the sudden high noises. The ""low"" frecuency sound is there, but its very less notcieable than the XM4, so its not quite a big issue to me.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

While talking about the sudden high frecuency noises, specially the keyboard noises, I found that the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of those noises, the sudden voices were also cancelled about 92.5% too.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

With the Bose, I found they cancelled about 95% of the sudden voices, and they cancelled 92.5% of the sudden high noises, like the keyboards, just like the XM5.

**Test 4 (Library /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3_eIwDWS_c&t=40s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the background chatter, the chatter felt more ""free"" comparing to the more ""compressed"" and ""trapped"" feeling of the chatter on the XM5. The sudden noises were cancelled about 80%

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The WH-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 90% of the background chatter, yes, the same amount than the XM5. After A/B for several minutes and focusing, I felt that the XM4 chatter felt more ""free"" and the XM5 felt more ""trapped"", while cancelling the same amount. And they cancelled about 85% of the sudden noises, 2.5% worse than the XM5.

**4-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 90% of the background chatter, the Bose got quieter here by a small gap, but noticeable gap. The sudden noises were cancelled about 87.5% on the Sony.

**3-4/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

Surprisingly, the APP2 cancelled 95% of the background chatter, but the sudden noises were cancelled about 80%, a tad worse than the WF-1000XM4. But I would say that the 95% cancelling of the background chatter compensate the sudden noises cancelling.

**2-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

The WF-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 95% of the background chatter. But the sudden noises are more noticeable on the Sony, cancelling aproximately 85%, specially the high noises and pages turnings.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The Bose cancelled about 95% of the background chatter, which is a ""low"" frecuency sound type of feeling, the sudden noises like pages turning or foot steps were cancelled about 90%. Ok, Im giving the win to the Bose here, but its by an absolutely micro difference, I spent about 30m just A/B/C between the Bose, the WF-1000XM4 and the APP2. They all cancelled almost all of the background noise, in occasions I felt that one was better, and in others I felt the others were better. The bose took maybe 5s-10s to completely adapt and then it cancelled at their max potential, I would say that for moments it cancelled 100% of the chatter. The WF-1000XM4 at the start cancelled maybe a tad more than 95% or even 100% of the chatter, but then it dropped to 95%, this might be due the ear tips fit, which is impossible to make them stay still 100% (Already tried all of them). But the high recuency sudden noises cancelling was better on the Bose here. What a competition, It took me a while to choose a winner here.

**Test 5 (Garden /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7qwcrKaUs) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The fountain sound was cancelled about 92.5%, its very reduced, but still there, and the birds noises were cancelled about 75%-80%, the Bose did a better job here, some of the bird noises i heard instantly on the APP2, with the Bose I didnt heard them for the first 2 times, then I focused and then I heard them.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 was able to cancell about 92.5% of the fountain noise, like the XM5. But the XM5 fountain noise felt more ""trapped"", while on the M4 felt more ""free"". The M4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the bird noise, which is a tad better than the WF-1000XM4 and a tad worse than the QC Ultra and XM5.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 managed to cancell 95% of the fountain noise, which is a little better than the APP2 but a little worse than the Bose and WF-1000XM4. The bird noises were cancelled about 85%, which is better than the in-ears, but a tad worse than the Bose.

**3.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

This time the WF-1000XM4 cancelled about 97.5% of the fountain noise, like the QC Ultra, and reduced about 80% of the bird noises, like the APP2. Again, the fountain noise is almost 100% killed, but when pausing / playing the video I could hear a small difference of the fountain noise, being very slightly noticeable when focusing.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the fountain noise, yes, 2.5% worse than the WH-1000XM4, but that might be the XM4 white noise camouflaging the fountain noise itself, but focusing purely on the fountain, the XM5 make it a tad more noticeable. But the bird noises were cancelled about 90%, like the QC Ultra.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The QC Ultra was able to cancell 97.5% of the fountain ""low"" frecuency water noise, the birds were cancelled by about 90%. A pretty good job. The fountain noise itself is almost 100% killed, you will probably dont notice it in a irl situation, I could tell a tiny bit of it was passing the ANC because I could tell a very small difference when pausing the video and putting it again, but again, its almost killed 100% once the ANC adapts after a few seconds.

**Test 6 (Rain /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-__3RANT4) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 90% of the rain noise, like the WH-1000XM4, and was able to cancell about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like all of the other over the ear headphones on the test.

**5.-3.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 was able to cancell 90% of the rain noise, a tad worse than the XM5. And it cancelled about 90% of the drops reaching the ground / water, just like the XM5 and QC Ultra.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the rain noise, and about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like the QC Ultra.

**3.-4.5/5⭐Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The rain itself was cancelled about 97.5%, while the drops touching the ground, probably was cancelled about 85%, not quite as good as the QC Ultra.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra**

95% of the rain itself was cancelled by the Bose, now, the drops touching the ground / water, was cancelled about 90%

**1.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER 🏆)**

The sound of the rain, was cancelled about 97.5%, like the APP2. But the drops touching the ground / water was cancelled about 85%.

**Test 7 (City /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3pj_3mdMc&t=15815s&pp=ygUUYW1iaWVuY2Ugc291bmRzIGNpdHk%3D) **)**

**6.-3/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 cancell about 85% of the background ""low"" noise, while they cancell about 75% of the people voices.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4, just like the XM5, cancell about 92.5% of the background ""low"" noise of the road, and they cancell about 80% of the people voices too.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

These ones cancell about 80% of the voices of the people. While they cancell, again, 92.5% of the ""low"" frecuency background noise, like the rest of this test do.

**3.-5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2 (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" nosie was cancelled by 95%. And the voices of the people ""passing by"" were cancelled by about 87.5%. The 5% remaining of the ""Low"" noise fells like a ""wind / white nosie"" type of noise, while the Bose is a ""light rumble"" type of noise.

**2.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (TIE 🏆)**

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 95% of the ""low"" frecuency noise. While they cancelled about 90% of the voices of the people.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" frecuency noise was cancelled about 95%. While the voices of the people ""passing by"" were reduced aproximately 90%. Alright this is a tie, the 3 headphones blocks the same amounbt of ""Low"" noise and the same amount of voices, like, literally almost 100% the same amount. Sometimes one headphone somehow adapts better and cancells half of a tad more. The APP2 5% remaining ""low"" nosie feels like a wind / light white noise, the 5% remaining of the QC Ultra and WF-XM4 feels like a light rumble of the road. Ill give a tie here, but I would stay with either the WF-XM4 or QC Ultra due I dont like that much the wind / white noise of the APP2 that remains. Tho the QC Ultra has a light white noise always due to ANC, and WF-XM4 requieres a very good seal to cancell properly, which it costs me sometimes. They all have their ""buts"".

  
**Conclusions 🎖️**

The Momentum 4 is a great headphone, but you can tell Sennheiser priority wasnt ANC, they achieve an awesome sound quality, but fall a little short when it comes to ANC and its competitors. While yes, its noticeable worst sometimes against the Bose, Sony and Apple. It isnt complete garbage, it gets the job done enough, at least for me, but there are better options.

The WH-1000XM4 holds very well for being 5 years old, while yes, its a step behind the QC Ultra, APP2 and WF-1000XM4, they are still incredible Noise cancelling headphones, surpasing almost everytime the Momentum 4 and being mostly on par with the WH-1000XM5.

The WH-1000XM5 is a slight upgrade from the WH-1000XM4 when it comes to ANC, but its not a huge difference, its Noise Cancelling its superb, but doing A/B testing did let me know that they are half a step behind the leaders here (APP2, WF-XM4 and QC Ultra), sometimes being an almost unnoticeable difference and sometimes being noticeable. Moving comparisons aside this is one of the best ANC you can get on a headphone right now.

The Airpods Pro 2 did surprise me a lot, they did match and even slightly surpass sometimes the QC Ultra capabilities when it comes to ANC, specially when it comes to constant noises like roads, rain and chatter. But, they fell significantly short when it came to cancell high frecuency noises, like the ones you find on an office or coffee shop, they are noticeable worst than the QC Ultra or WH-1000XM5, besides that, they do an awesome job and get in the same level of the QC Ultra.

The WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the APP2, but being better cancelling those high frecuency noises considerably, but being very slightly worst sometimes cancelling those constant noises. This ones are on par with the QC Ultra and imo slightly better on most of the occassions against the Airpods Pro 2. But, getting a perfect seal is crucial you have to find the right spor after trying for several time to achieve their 100% ANC capabilities, if not, the ANC will leak and it will not be the same, overall a surprising performance.

The QC Ultra, what would you excpect, Bose created ANC and they have been the kings, or the top 2 since their creation. After intense testing, almost 100% of the times the QC Ultra were very slightly superior than my XM5, they were on par with the APP2 and WF-XM4 cancelling those constant noise, sometimes very slightly worse and sometimes very slightly better, but what they do considerably better, is cancelling those high frecuency noises, sometimes those sounds on the APP2 were noticeable, and with the QC Ultra I would have to focus to pick them up. BUT, yes, there is always a but, they have slight white noise while using the ANC, on loud places it wont be as noticeable, but in some tests that things got very quiet, the white noise was slightly more noticeable. Imo its not bothering at al, but its there, just to let you all know.

Below Ill put the charts which are the gathering of the results we already viewed, and some notes to take in mind, it took me 3 days with very intense A/B testing, but it was fun and entretaining, thanks a lot for reading this! See you on the next time!

Headphones Used : Sony WH-1000XM5 / Sony WH-1000XM4 / Sony WF-1000MX4 / Bose QuietComfort Ultra / Apple Airpods Pro 2 / Sennheiser Momentum 4

**Test 1 (Coffee Shop /** [**Video used** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiMXGIG_DQo&t=10360s)**)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

This have astonishing sound quality, but this is not why we are here. The Momentum 4 have a decent ANC, but its noticeable a step behind the competitors. Its like a step behind the XM4, while the XM4 are already a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra. The Momentum 4 cancelled the high frecuency noises very well tho, again, about 85%. But the background chatter was cancelled about 70%, and the sudden loud voices about 70% too. Its ANC is enough, for me atleast, but its not as good as Sony or Bose.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 are basically a step behind the XM5, just like you would excpect, since the XM5 is the direct upgrade from the XM4. The XM4 cancelled less background chatter, comparing it to the XM5 and Bose, the XM4 cancelled about 77.5%, its noticeable but not an absolute enormous gap. The XM4 did cancell very well the sudden loud voices tho. probably 77.5% aproximately, maybe 75%. They did cancell very well the high frecuency noises too, probably 85%, like the Bose. Overall is a step behind the XM5 and QC Ultra, but its still an absolute banger for ANC to the date, its just there are better options now.

**4.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Im absolutely surprised here, the Airpods Pro 2 cancelled the background chatter about what? 95%!!?? It absolutely surprised me, they cancelled better than the Bose flagship over the ear headphones, and better than Sony WH-1000XM5! Even the loud sudden voices were cancelled by about 90% ??!! They absolutely smashed it! Tho I musyt say, they did not cancell the high frecuencies very well, comparing to the rest, they probably cancelled about 70%, they felt short in that aspect, but for the voices they absolutely nailed it.

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

With the XM5, the high noises were equally cancelled comparing them to the bose, about 85% probably. Now, the background chatter only, the Sony cancelled about 85% of the background chatter. The sudden kid and loud voices was cancelled by an average of 82.5% probably, a tad worse than the Bose here.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra\*\*

With the Bose QC Ultra (Over the ear), the high frecuency noises like the forks, cups or that sort of stuff, the Bose cancelled it very good, some of the cup noises leaked but very muffled, by average the high frecuency noises were cancelled by about 85%. The background chatter was cancelled by 90% aprox, and the kids or loud sudden voices were cancelled about 85%, overall a pretty awesome job and definetely close to being perfect.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

Im surprised again, the WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the Airpods when it comes to the voices. The background chatter was cancelled by about 92.5%. And the sudden loud voices were cancelled about 85%. Then, they cancelled the high frecuency noises by about 85%!

**Test 2 (Plane Noise /** [**Video used**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEGmghn_jo&t=392s) **)**

**6.-3/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

The rumble noise on the Momentum 4 was cancelled about 80%-85%, but the ""wind"" noise itself was not as greatly cancelled, it was drained out about 75%, which its a very noticeable downgrade from the 90% of the QC Ultra and XM5.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

These ones, like the in-ear version, also cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, while the ""wind"" noise is cancelled about 90%, like the XM5, the XM4 wind noise is sort of ""low"" frecuency wind, like the QC Ultra, and not like trying to whistle with your mouth, like the XM5. I found that besides the three Sonys cancelling all 92.5% of the rumble noise, the XM5 felt like the noise was a little more controlled, and both the WF and WH XM4 the rumble noise felt a little bit more ""loose"", so I would give the XM5 a very small gap just because of that.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

Here, the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the engine rumble noise, the ""air / wind"" nosie was cancelled about 90% too

**3.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

Just like the WF-1000XM4, I found that they cancelled also 100% of the ""wind"" noise, and 92.5% of the rumble engine noise.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 100% of the ""wind"" noise! And they also managed to cancell 92.5% of the engine rumble noise too! Im giving the WF-1000XM5 the lead over the APP2 since I felt that rumble noise was more ""controlled"", and not so loose like the APP2

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

The rumble noise itself of the engine, is 100% cancelled with the QC Ultra, but the ""air / wind"" sound itself, its still audible, aproximately cancelled by about 92.5% maybe, the XM5 ""wind"" nosie is more like a high frecuency wind, while the QC Ultra ""wind"" noise is like a more ""low"" frecuency wind. Its hard to explain, but its what I feel with them, the XM5 feels more like trying to whistle with your mouth, but not whistling, while the Bose feels like a relaxed engine noise without the rumble. Im giving Bose the win here, the rumble engine noise is gone and the wind noise is also cancelled almost perfectly, while yes, its not 100% cancelled like the in-ears, its still not that far and the rumble is completely gone, which is a more noticeable thing imo.

**Test 3 (Office /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sQXSdzk6U4&t=2456s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM4\*\*

The XM4 cancelled about 87.5% of the sudden voices, about 90% of the keyboard noises, and I noticed a lot of low frecuency sound as background of the officce, the XM5 and the Bose cancelled it 100%, since I didnt even noticed it, but the XM4 create this low frecuency background sound, due to accumulation of sounds maybe, that cancell maybe 75%? Its like the airplane engine rumble lol, a big noticeable step behind on this specific sound, besides this low frecuency sound, they still perform good, but not as good as the XM5 and Bose. Whil yes, they cancell 5% more of the high noises than the in-ears, they are considerable worse on cancelling the sudden voices + they have this ""low"" frecuency sound which is very noticeable.

**5.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WF-1000XM4\*\*

The WF-1000XM4 cancelled 95% of the sudden voices, the same amount comparing it to the QC Ultra, but cancelled about 85% of the high frecuency noises, like the keyboard noises. Which is weird, watching how well they performed on Test 1 with high noises, but on this test, they didnt do as well. There is not a ""low"" frecuency sound like on the WH-1000XM4 and Momentum 4.

**4.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Apple Airpods Pro 2\*\*

The APP2, also did a not so good job with the high frecuency noises, like keyboards, they cancelled about 82.5%-85% noise. But when it comes to the sudden voices, they cancelled 97.5%, a tad better than the QC Ultra, to the point i had to focus to hear them. There is no ""low"" frecuency sound here.

**3.-4/5**⭐\*\*-Sennheiser Momentum 4\*\*

Surprisingly, the sudden voices were cancelled about 92.5%, yes, the same amount of noise cancelling than the XM5, and I would dare to say that it felt a very little tad quieter than the XM5 (in this specific sound), maybe is the rest of the more noticeable sounds masking it, but it felt quieter. the keyboard typing noises were cancelled about 87.5%, a tad worse than the XM4, and that ""low"" frecuency sound that was really noticeable on the XM4, here is way less, but its still there, maybe 90% cancelled, but not as bad on the XM4, which was about 75% cancelled. Im giving them the lead over the APP2 since they cancell more of the sudden high noises considerably, I prefer cancelling 5% better of those high noises instead of 5% better of those sudden voices, but you may prefer the APP2 if you like better cancelling more of the sudden voices instead of the sudden high noises. The ""low"" frecuency sound is there, but its very less notcieable than the XM4, so its not quite a big issue to me.

**2.-4.5/5**⭐\*\*-Sony WH-1000XM5\*\*

While talking about the sudden high frecuency noises, specially the keyboard noises, I found that the XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of those noises, the sudden voices were also cancelled about 92.5% too.

**1.-5/5**⭐\*\*-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER\*\* 🏆\*\*)\*\*

With the Bose, I found they cancelled about 95% of the sudden voices, and they cancelled 92.5% of the sudden high noises, like the keyboards, just like the XM5.

**Test 4 (Library /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3_eIwDWS_c&t=40s) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the background chatter, the chatter felt more ""free"" comparing to the more ""compressed"" and ""trapped"" feeling of the chatter on the XM5. The sudden noises were cancelled about 80%

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The WH-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 90% of the background chatter, yes, the same amount than the XM5. After A/B for several minutes and focusing, I felt that the XM4 chatter felt more ""free"" and the XM5 felt more ""trapped"", while cancelling the same amount. And they cancelled about 85% of the sudden noises, 2.5% worse than the XM5.

**4-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 90% of the background chatter, the Bose got quieter here by a small gap, but noticeable gap. The sudden noises were cancelled about 87.5% on the Sony.

**3-4/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

Surprisingly, the APP2 cancelled 95% of the background chatter, but the sudden noises were cancelled about 80%, a tad worse than the WF-1000XM4. But I would say that the 95% cancelling of the background chatter compensate the sudden noises cancelling.

**2-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

The WF-1000XM4 managed to cancell about 95% of the background chatter. But the sudden noises are more noticeable on the Sony, cancelling aproximately 85%, specially the high noises and pages turnings.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The Bose cancelled about 95% of the background chatter, which is a ""low"" frecuency sound type of feeling, the sudden noises like pages turning or foot steps were cancelled about 90%. Ok, Im giving the win to the Bose here, but its by an absolutely micro difference, I spent about 30m just A/B/C between the Bose, the WF-1000XM4 and the APP2. They all cancelled almost all of the background noise, in occasions I felt that one was better, and in others I felt the others were better. The bose took maybe 5s-10s to completely adapt and then it cancelled at their max potential, I would say that for moments it cancelled 100% of the chatter. The WF-1000XM4 at the start cancelled maybe a tad more than 95% or even 100% of the chatter, but then it dropped to 95%, this might be due the ear tips fit, which is impossible to make them stay still 100% (Already tried all of them). But the high recuency sudden noises cancelling was better on the Bose here. What a competition, It took me a while to choose a winner here.

**Test 5 (Garden /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7qwcrKaUs) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The fountain sound was cancelled about 92.5%, its very reduced, but still there, and the birds noises were cancelled about 75%-80%, the Bose did a better job here, some of the bird noises i heard instantly on the APP2, with the Bose I didnt heard them for the first 2 times, then I focused and then I heard them.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 was able to cancell about 92.5% of the fountain noise, like the XM5. But the XM5 fountain noise felt more ""trapped"", while on the M4 felt more ""free"". The M4 were able to cancell about 87.5% of the bird noise, which is a tad better than the WF-1000XM4 and a tad worse than the QC Ultra and XM5.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 managed to cancell 95% of the fountain noise, which is a little better than the APP2 but a little worse than the Bose and WF-1000XM4. The bird noises were cancelled about 85%, which is better than the in-ears, but a tad worse than the Bose.

**3.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4**

This time the WF-1000XM4 cancelled about 97.5% of the fountain noise, like the QC Ultra, and reduced about 80% of the bird noises, like the APP2. Again, the fountain noise is almost 100% killed, but when pausing / playing the video I could hear a small difference of the fountain noise, being very slightly noticeable when focusing.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the fountain noise, yes, 2.5% worse than the WH-1000XM4, but that might be the XM4 white noise camouflaging the fountain noise itself, but focusing purely on the fountain, the XM5 make it a tad more noticeable. But the bird noises were cancelled about 90%, like the QC Ultra.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (WINNER 🏆)**

The QC Ultra was able to cancell 97.5% of the fountain ""low"" frecuency water noise, the birds were cancelled by about 90%. A pretty good job. The fountain noise itself is almost 100% killed, you will probably dont notice it in a irl situation, I could tell a tiny bit of it was passing the ANC because I could tell a very small difference when pausing the video and putting it again, but again, its almost killed 100% once the ANC adapts after a few seconds.

**Test 6 (Rain /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-__3RANT4) **)**

**6.-3.5/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 were able to cancell about 90% of the rain noise, like the WH-1000XM4, and was able to cancell about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like all of the other over the ear headphones on the test.

**5.-3.5/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4 was able to cancell 90% of the rain noise, a tad worse than the XM5. And it cancelled about 90% of the drops reaching the ground / water, just like the XM5 and QC Ultra.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

The XM5 cancelled about 92.5% of the rain noise, and about 90% of the drops reaching the ground, like the QC Ultra.

**3.-4.5/5⭐Apple Airpods Pro 2**

The rain itself was cancelled about 97.5%, while the drops touching the ground, probably was cancelled about 85%, not quite as good as the QC Ultra.

**2.-4.5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra**

95% of the rain itself was cancelled by the Bose, now, the drops touching the ground / water, was cancelled about 90%

**1.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (WINNER 🏆)**

The sound of the rain, was cancelled about 97.5%, like the APP2. But the drops touching the ground / water was cancelled about 85%.

**Test 7 (City /** [Video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3pj_3mdMc&t=15815s&pp=ygUUYW1iaWVuY2Ugc291bmRzIGNpdHk%3D) **)**

**6.-3/5⭐-Sennheiser Momentum 4**

The Momentum 4 cancell about 85% of the background ""low"" noise, while they cancell about 75% of the people voices.

**5.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM4**

The XM4, just like the XM5, cancell about 92.5% of the background ""low"" noise of the road, and they cancell about 80% of the people voices too.

**4.-4/5⭐-Sony WH-1000XM5**

These ones cancell about 80% of the voices of the people. While they cancell, again, 92.5% of the ""low"" frecuency background noise, like the rest of this test do.

**3.-5/5⭐-Apple Airpods Pro 2 (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" nosie was cancelled by 95%. And the voices of the people ""passing by"" were cancelled by about 87.5%. The 5% remaining of the ""Low"" noise fells like a ""wind / white nosie"" type of noise, while the Bose is a ""light rumble"" type of noise.

**2.-5/5⭐-Sony WF-1000XM4 (TIE 🏆)**

The WF-1000XM4 were able to cancell 95% of the ""low"" frecuency noise. While they cancelled about 90% of the voices of the people.

**1.-5/5⭐-Bose QuietComfort Ultra (TIE 🏆)**

The background ""low"" frecuency noise was cancelled about 95%. While the voices of the people ""passing by"" were reduced aproximately 90%. Alright this is a tie, the 3 headphones blocks the same amounbt of ""Low"" noise and the same amount of voices, like, literally almost 100% the same amount. Sometimes one headphone somehow adapts better and cancells half of a tad more. The APP2 5% remaining ""low"" nosie feels like a wind / light white noise, the 5% remaining of the QC Ultra and WF-XM4 feels like a light rumble of the road. Ill give a tie here, but I would stay with either the WF-XM4 or QC Ultra due I dont like that much the wind / white noise of the APP2 that remains. Tho the QC Ultra has a light white noise always due to ANC, and WF-XM4 requieres a very good seal to cancell properly, which it costs me sometimes. They all have their ""buts"".

  
**Conclusions 🎖️**

The Momentum 4 is a great headphone, but you can tell Sennheiser priority wasnt ANC, they achieve an awesome sound quality, but fall a little short when it comes to ANC and its competitors. While yes, its noticeable worst sometimes against the Bose, Sony and Apple. It isnt complete garbage, it gets the job done enough, at least for me, but there are better options.

The WH-1000XM4 holds very well for being 5 years old, while yes, its a step behind the QC Ultra, APP2 and WF-1000XM4, they are still incredible Noise cancelling headphones, surpasing almost everytime the Momentum 4 and being mostly on par with the WH-1000XM5.

The WH-1000XM5 is a slight upgrade from the WH-1000XM4 when it comes to ANC, but its not a huge difference, its Noise Cancelling its superb, but doing A/B testing did let me know that they are half a step behind the leaders here (APP2, WF-XM4 and QC Ultra), sometimes being an almost unnoticeable difference and sometimes being noticeable. Moving comparisons aside this is one of the best ANC you can get on a headphone right now.

The Airpods Pro 2 did surprise me a lot, they did match and even slightly surpass sometimes the QC Ultra capabilities when it comes to ANC, specially when it comes to constant noises like roads, rain and chatter. But, they fell significantly short when it came to cancell high frecuency noises, like the ones you find on an office or coffee shop, they are noticeable worst than the QC Ultra or WH-1000XM5, besides that, they do an awesome job and get in the same level of the QC Ultra.

The WF-1000XM4 did a similar job to the APP2, but being better cancelling those high frecuency noises considerably, but being very slightly worst sometimes cancelling those constant noises. This ones are on par with the QC Ultra and imo slightly better on most of the occassions against the Airpods Pro 2. But, getting a perfect seal is crucial you have to find the right spor after trying for several time to achieve their 100% ANC capabilities, if not, the ANC will leak and it will not be the same, overall a surprising performance.

The QC Ultra, what would you excpect, Bose created ANC and they have been the kings, or the top 2 since their creation. After intense testing, almost 100% of the times the QC Ultra were very slightly superior than my XM5, they were on par with the APP2 and WF-XM4 cancelling those constant noise, sometimes very slightly worse and sometimes very slightly better, but what they do considerably better, is cancelling those high frecuency noises, sometimes those sounds on the APP2 were noticeable, and with the QC Ultra I would have to focus to pick them up. BUT, yes, there is always a but, they have slight white noise while using the ANC, on loud places it wont be as noticeable, but in some tests that things got very quiet, the white noise was slightly more noticeable. Imo its not bothering at al, but its there, just to let you all know.

Below Ill put the charts which are the gathering of the results we already viewed, and some notes to take in mind, it took me 3 days with very intense A/B testing, but it was fun and entretaining, thanks a lot for reading this! See you on the next time!

**NOTES** 📝

\-The charts are the gathering of the results made on the A/B testing, they are not charts from internet or objective measurments

\-The % wont be 100% accurate to reality, I took them as reference or as a stand point to then calculate how much % would the others get, it may be lower / higher depdening on the situation you are.

\-ANC performance also depends highly of how much of a good seal you get with your headphones, if you wear glasses or if the ear tips of the in-ear dont fit on you, the ANC performance might be lowered.

\-The QC Ultra and WH-1000XM4 have slight white noise when using ANC on a quiet place, in most of loud places you wont hear it at all. On the APP2, WF-1000XM4, WH-1000XM5 and Momentum 4 I couldnt find any white noise on ANC while on a quiet place.

\-This was obtained by an A/B long testing, I did not base myself on any online charts or objective stats measurments on internet. This was pure listening and focusing on which cancelled more noise than the other.

\-Yes, I actually did this because I got bored, this is completely done by hand and tested one by one by me, it just entretains me and its nice to see which headphone is better cancelling some sounds and worse while cancelling others, its fun, at least for me...",2,1748806411.0,SonyHeadphones,0,1.0,False

I decided to compile everything I know about Rotman Commerce first-year. 

For those who can't decide between rotman, shulich, queens or ivey (western), I'll include a comparison section at the end.

**ROTMAN STRUCTURE:**

* **1st year** \- UofT tries to weed out kids before 2nd year. Diligence is more important than intelligence, and the workload increases significantly from high school. Try to get an internship 1st-2nd year summer, but it's not mandatory. 
* **2nd year** \- Two year-long courses (ECO204 and ECO220), consistently called the hardest year at Rotman. RSM332 is also a killer course. Somewhat mandatory to get an internship 2nd-3rd year summer.
* **3rd year** \- Start to specialize (3 choices: Finance and economics, management, accounting). Management has the most options for 'focuses', and is the most flexible. Finance/econ and accounting are more targeted (3 options for focuses). Some people begin taking specialization courses in the second year. Must have an internship 2nd-3rd year summer.
* **4th year** \- Finish specializations, most people secure a job offer while they're still in school.

**ROTMAN - NOTES FIRST YEAR COURSES**:

* **MAT133** \- Full-year math course. Seems easy at the beginning but picks up quickly (keep in mind if you are IB, you may have to do vectors for the first time). There are mandatory group projects and I recommend asking your TA to look it over beforehand. They do not add all requirements to the rubric/criteria, and will deduct marks.
* **ECO101** \- Two teachers: Gazzale vs Freitas. Gazzale is an excellent teacher, but theory-heavy. Freitas is a bit more calculation-heavy. Gazzale has more in-depth practice questions, which are worth doing even if you have Freitas. The class average is C+.
* **ECO102** \- I had a new teacher, so I believe my experience will not be reflective. However, ECO102 is generally more theory-focused in comparison to ECO101 (many people find it easier). 
* **RSM100** \- Read the textbook for the midterm. There is a mandatory case competition woven into the course. In my class, our group got the highest grade (95% raw, \~105% with semi-finals bonus). My biggest tip for the report is to take their template and streamline it to your data (don't be afraid to delete subtopics, just keep the overall structure the same). If you want to make the semi-finals, the mandatory video plays a significant part. The class average is B-B+.
* **RSM219** \- DO THE TEXTBOOK PROBLEMS. Midterm is going to be rough, but the final is multiple choice so it evens out. The class average was around a B.
* **RSM230, RSM350** \- More concept-heavy than mathematical. Just attend class (birdy).
* **CSC108** \- A popular computer science elective for Rotman students. Quite a lot of work, but extremely fair. Make sure you stay on top of concepts, and the midterm/final will be intuitive. One of my favourite courses at UofT (no cs knowledge prior).

  
**ROTMAN VERSUS OTHER SCHOOLS**:

**COOP/INTERNSHIPS** 

* Rotman does not offer coop, or have relationships with corporations that other schools might (ex. Waterloo). However, UofT has a robust work-study selection (work for university departments/research). 
* In general, Rotman will help you craft your resume or improve your interview skills but you are on your own when it comes to securing an internship.

**GPA/MARKS**

* IF YOU WANT A HIGH GPA, DO NOT COME TO ROTMAN. Only 10% of Rotman has above a 3.5 GPA, and they adjust our marks to maintain that proportion. 
* For example, UofT engages in ""mark deflation,"" where if a class average is too high, they will artificially lower it through the final exam. You do not receive your grade breakdown nor the class average for the exam. You must manually request an exam viewing after June 1st, and a regrade is roughly $50. In other words, Rotman makes it extremely difficult to contest your final grade.
* Rotman offers no way to contest participation grades. For example, if you get sick, professors are not allowed to give you special consideration. It does not matter if your entire family died, Rotman will immediately reject your request (and missing one class in Rotman may be up to 3% off your final grade).
* **TLDR**: Rotman protects UofT's reputation, not the students.

**SOCIAL/TECHNICAL SKILLS**

* Rotman is very good at training technical skills related to finance/economics or accounting. However, Rotman grads are notorious for lacking soft skills. This is because Rotman courses are structured to be test-heavy, not case-based. This puts Rotman students behind Ivey students in terms of presentation/networking skills.
* Additionally, keep in mind Rotman students must study significantly more to achieve the same GPA as other business programs (ex. Shulich, Ivey). This takes time away from networking events and coffee chats.

**CLUBS** 

* Rotman has an amazing assortment of clubs that are reflective of the business sphere with good ""entry-level"" positions. However, clubs have an interview process for positions, which includes a cover letter (and occasionally a presentation). This may make it daunting for new students. 
* Connecting with directors (fellow students) or entering mentorship programs are excellent ways to secure a position. Please keep in mind certain clubs (ex. RCCA) have 100+ applicants for popular positions.
* To avoid ""toxic Rotman culture"" (which does exist, if you meet the wrong people), I recommend to have one ""fun club"" (Ex. RC art , RC fashion ) and one ""professional club"" (Ex. RC consulting, RC marketing, RC international business). There is a two-club limit on RC students.

  
I hope this helps, I know there isn't too much info out there (or its rlly scattered). I just believe people should have all the information about Rotman/UofT before making a decision. Feel free to ask more questions bc I couldn't cover residence or 2nd-year courses.",6,1748806290.0,RotmanCommerce,2,1.0,False

Is it breakup material ?,"Hello everyone, long time lurker here. Throwaway because a friend of mine knows my main account. I am facing some issues with my girlfriend, and I am writing it all here to get some insight on the situation because it feels like I am going crazy.

This is very long, I apologize in advance and I deeply thank anyone that will read it even partially in order to give me some insight.

We are currently facing some issues that kind of let me with a bitter taste.

For context I (26M) have been with my girlfriend C (25F) for 9 months now. It has mostly been going fine between the two of us. We met last July while I was in my howetown, forced to go live with my mother due to unemployment. She recently moved to my hometown with her mother and grandmother to live in their newly built house. It went fine for quite some time. I worked at low wages job, she opened her dance school and worked in the evening. We spent a lot of time together, went on small holidays together, went out etc. She doesn’t really have friends, and neither did I in my hometown, all my friends living away.

It changed when I found a more stable job in my original line of work 5 hours away. Ever since the beginning she always knew I planned on going away and had no intention of living in my hometown or near. I originally planned on living abroad, so finding a job 5 hours away was actually an improvement. I have been in my new job for two months now.

Here is when it started going downhill. Even though she has always been supportive of my plans, things changed when I moved.

We fought more frequently, longer and harder each time. It often starts with something small and escalate, despite my attempts at asking her to be clear in her demands. Our fight would frequently grow bigger, and she would attack me on many aspects of my life, past of present, or things that did not seem to bother her at the time.

I met some friends here, and I am starting to build a little life. I’ve been slacklining with a colleague of mine in a parc, I get along well with my roommates etc. I am actually very happy with how things are going, jobs is going well and I thought things were fine with C too. During this time, she has been working hard for her gala. It is a show she has been preparing for the whole year, creating every choreography, imagining a big show. She is a great artist, she dances incredibly well, has a lot of imagination and is able to make her imagination come to life which is pretty wonderful if you ask me.  
  


Back to the issue. Three weeks ago, one week prior to the gala, I told her I was going out with some friends, my roommates A (M26), his gf E (F25) and a friend of theirs (M34). She seemed alright with it. During the evening, we talked, laughed, and drank at my place. During this time, I was also talking with C, then she wished me good night. Around 12am we went out to a dancing bar where we had a lot of fun up until 3-4 am when we all head back. I went straight to sleep. I woke up around 11 am, I sent a message to C. She asked me some questions, I asked her what her plans and she were told me she had a repetition that day. She went off on me telling me I should have come that week-end to help her because she needed help, that I only thought about myself, drinking and cheating.  
I was baffled, she had almost never mentioned she had a repetition despite us frequently telling each other informed about our whereabouts, plans and general organization. I apologized, she then stopped answering until the evening when she called me.

We had a big fight, as usual she went off about many things in my life. It lasted about an hour and a half where she called me boring, and alcoholic, a cheater and many things. She reproached me my partying days, said that going out with friends without your gf is single behaviour, that I was probably cheating with E (rommate’s gf) and that she (my gf) was better than her anyway so I was an idiot.

She also went off on me because I went alone to an extended family reunion 2 months back.

There was a lot of yelling, after that we spoke very little during the week.

Her gala was coming at the end of the week, so she reluctantly called me to see If I was still helping, to which I said of course. Ever since she told me about the gala at the beginning of our relationship I proposed my help, and it has been an understanding that I would be helping a lot that day.

A bit of context on her mother but I will make it short. We have always had kind of a strained relationship because she tend to be extremely directive with people, is mean with people when they are not here (seen first hand when she talks about her adorable neighbours, her sister etc, but acts nice when they are here), and has never shown gratitude when I do things for them (walking their dog, fixing stuff, building stuff).

Her mother asked for me to be here the previous day too because they needed my arms to load the truck (there was a lot of stuff including chairs, a couch, heavy metal boards and stuff). Considering she demanded for me to be there instead of asking politely for my help I admit that I was not exactly enchanted. I reluctantly said yes, even though I wanted to spend this evening with my family and particularly my sister whom I hadn’t seen in months.

On Friday I took my day off to be sure to be on time to help her in the evening, I almost entirely loaded the truck and helped them for a few hours.

The next morning was a very very long day. They came to get me at 7:45 am. The day started with her mother berating me because I was 30 seconds late. The whole day was a nightmare. I worked a lot, emptying the truck almost by myself, building stuff for the stage set, managing kids, inflate helium balloons, helping at the kitchen, buying bread, helping organize the timing, all while barely eating because they always had something for me to do. There was a lot of people helping them, my gf god mother and her husband, C’s mother’s friend, and a lot of their students helping. But I can say that I was the one that did the most, and I am not trying to bring myself up by saying this, this is just facts.  
  
Her mother made several remarks during the day, berating me when not done the way she wants, even though some stuff were just never explained to me. The first blow up happened during the afternoon during a repetition, her mother asked me to organize the class’s timing (telling which danse was next, which class had to prepare, telling them when to go and making sure children were not passing behind the scene). At some point some children managed to cross behind the scene. She then reprimanded me hard, she told me that I was essentially doing a shitty job, scolding me in front of many people. It was very humiliating, but I took it. Then she made sneaky remarks such as “tough, eh?” in a sarcastic way. I raised my eyebrows but said nothing. Some moms came to me, and tried to be nice with me saying that I had to be strong to keep on helping C, my gf and acknowledging that gf’s mom  was out of line.

Several minutes later gf’s mom D (F45) came to me asking me why I was so susceptible. I told her now was not the time and to just let me work in peace. She said it was the right time, I told her ok. So I told her it was no way of speaking to someone, especially when I am volunteering and working hard for them. She told me that’s how she speaks to everyone, I told her maybe, but that does not mean I have to accept it and if I am not happy I can go. Long story short she told me to leave. I was kind of devastated of being treated like that when I have been doing so muck to support and help my gf.

I kind of left to cool down for and hour or two, then came back to help for some other stuff up until the start of the show.

The second blow-up happened when I was helping welcome people inside, checking the tickets and stuff, when I saw that her grandma was walking with her ex (They have been together for 4 years, and split up a few months before we got together). I now know gf’s mother D gave him the time and address, gf’s godmother knew too, gf’s didn’t. When she saw me she pulled me apart begging me not to make a scene, I told her that I wouldn’t but she shouldn’t have any contact with him and refuse whatever gift he got her. She accepted.

The rest of the evening went fine, she put up a hell of a show and people loved it without any exaggeration. I loved it too, and despite everything that went that day I was extremely proud of her. My family was there too, they also loved it.

The week-end pretty muck ended like that, I helped them until the end, loading the truck, cleaning, etc. The next day I took the train and went back to my place.

On Tuesday, two days later, she was supposed to come to my place. Things were ok on the phone, But I told her we had things to discuss that were not ok but that we would wait to be together to discuss these instead of the phone.

While on the train she was cold with me. I was at work but still tried to sometime make sure everything was ok, that she managed to get on the train etc. But she was still cold. Considering C would have to wait for me to get off work, roommate’s gf E sent me a message asking me if C would like to get a coffee with her to spend time. I asked my gf… And all hell went loose. She started by being very cold, then, when her train was supposed to arrive, entirely stopped responding. It lasted almost 3 hours between 3:30 pm and 6:30 pm. Meanwhile I was worried sick. After work I went straight home and waited for her. I texted, called but she wouldn’t answering. Nothing. And my calls went straight to voicemail.

She arrived around 6:30 pm, I was pissed. I asked her if that was a bad joke, she directly turned around. I now know that considering she was far away from home she asked a friend of mine she saw a few times to take her in and she planned to sleep at his place if things didn’t go her way.

I went after her because I was entirely lost at what I had done wrong. I was also angry, and told her that is she wanted to leave and not even tell me what’s wrong we were done. She screamed at me that I was a dirty fucking cheater, I didn’t deserve her. And by scream, I mean real scream. My neighbours could hear us, my roommates too. During this time, I had never seen her so furious. So even though I though I was the one that needed to be apologized to… I was actually the one to try and calm her down, apologize and try to understand what’s wrong. Turns out that because I have E’s number (for organization issue mainly to avoid her being stuck outside the house while waiting for my roommate) she thought I was cheating on her. And for the whole 4 or 5 hour fight she kept on believing it, calling me names. Once again, as during every fight, she criticized many aspect of me, my family and my life. She said I only thought about partying (I partied twice in two month, and I include drinking with my roommates at home), my sister is a hypocrite even though my sis has been welcoming with her, my mother is too nosy, I am basically a man whore because I want to be seen, all while defending her mother.  
I tried to be the bigger person and to tell her that piling up accusation was no way of communication, I spent a long time trying to explain to her why I was so hurt by the gala’s event, but that night she just responded with more accusation, and that it somehow was kinda my fault. She made me promise not to go out without her anymore, and that she understand going out with an old friend but not people I have know for 1 month or two.

She cried, locked herself in my bathroom because she thought I was cheating, I went to get her and convince her I was not, we talked some more and I tried to get her to open up. I asked her why she was with me if she thought I was so bad of a bf, she said that it is because she love me.

Days went by and we found a balance. We don’t really talk about the discussion or what happened. She admitted later that my help was needed at the gala, we said that we love each other. The next few days were nice.

This was two weeks ago. I told her that I didn’t want to see her mother and grandmother no more considering they made it clear they wanted her back with her ex. I also now know that her mother is pissed at me because gf and I were low contact the week before the gala, when it’s when she needed me the most, which I apologized for.

The thing is, I feel kind of broken. After everything that happened I just can’t seem to get over it, my gf seem just fine and wants us to get over it. She wants me to go to her house, which I refuse because I just don’t want to see her family rn.

Considering my gf and family thinks I am an asshole, what do you think? I just need an insight, even if it hurts.",1,1748806276.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I won’t go all the way back to January, just the last two weeks where back to back I got Covid and had a sinus infection. It started with a bad sore throat and I normally do the announcements, but I didn’t want to do them cause my throat hurt, they showed zero fucks and told me to do them anyways.

Then later that evening I bought a bottle of water and small tote cause I was gonna swing by Walmart to get a Covid test and some soups. My manager was on the walkie trying to tell me to do a 15 minute closing  announcement but because I was talking to my coworker I didn’t hear her, but I did after she started SCREAMING. I was like HOLY CRAP, is the store on fire?? Why are we yelling?? I looked at the clock it would’ve been a 1 minute difference.

Then I got home, took the test, had Covid, the next morning I took the day off, and when I called it was the same manager who had yelled at me, I told her I had Covid, and she was like, “ok”, and hung up. Bitch didn’t even say, “feel better”. Like Jesus, have some humanity, amiright?

The next two day I kept being sent home early cause I looked like actual death, I couldn’t talk cause Covid wrecked my throat, and ppl felt uncomfortable but I wasn’t given sick time cause our company sucks ass. And even tho I couldn’t talk? I got someone to sign up for a credit card! But I didn’t get any recognition!?!

We get like these cards for doing good which can get you a raffle prize, and you get one for a credit card BUT I DIDNT GET ONE. LIKE WHAT BS?!

And then due to my voice being out of commission, I’ve had this guy speaking in my place, and everyone’s just been on their knees kissing his ass, thanking him and I’m like, “tf?”(hyperbole intended). Then today, some spilled coffee, didn’t tell us, I inform everyone on the walkie and go to start getting stuff to clean it, then I got this lout who I’ll address as such, who comes by with those brown towels that don’t do shit. Then here comes aforementioned manager who’s like, “we need a mop!”

So I run, grab a mop and bucket, and get to work! Mop up the trail of coffee! While my good for nothing manager sits there with her dick in her hand. After I’m done, I’m hunting down the wet signs, asking people on the walkie where they went. I come back and the lout is like, “they were in the dressing room!” And the manager is all in high praise!

And I’m like, “wtf…what about me??”

Like I’m not asking y’all to throw me a party but a “thank you” goes a LONG WAY, and any managers reading this post? You better learn to appreciate your people, cause I’m done going the extra mile or selling credit cards.",3,1748806267.0,retailhell,1,1.0,False

└ 1-3. Verso

**1. What Each Person Wanted, and How They Acted**

At the point when Aline is cast out of the Canvas — the game’s final phase — the three people who hold the initiative are Renoir, Maelle, and Verso. Each of them has something they want, and they try to achieve it by violently subduing the others. Regardless of whose ending comes to pass, it all leads to a highly extreme and tragic conclusion.

Why, then, did their choices lead to such a tragic outcome? The reason is simple. None of them had truly reflected on what it was they really wanted, or what they had to do to achieve it.

A choice made without proper contemplation is not only tragic in its outcome — the very process of making such a choice is itself tragic.

First, none of the three actually wants the immediate destruction of the Lumière Canvas as their ultimate goal.

Second, none of them hates or emotionally resents the others. On the contrary, they love and respect one another.

Third, none of them is under time pressure.

In other words, there were plenty of opportunities to compromise, no external forces obstructing such compromise, and even sufficient time to reach an agreement. Despite this, they threw away all those possibilities and behaved as if bent on destroying everything in the worst possible way. As a result, a tragedy that never needed to happen ends up consuming them.

To put it nicely, they acted foolishly. To put it realistically, they acted like people suffering from serious mental health problems. Honestly, I love Renoir, Maelle, and Verso. But at the same time, I believe all of them were in an extremely unstable mental state. Sadly so.

So, what would have been the best choice in that situation? To answer that, we first need to examine what each of them truly wanted.

**1-1. Renoir**  
Renoir truly wants two things.

(A) That Maelle does not become a corpse inside the canvas  
(B) That the Desandre family does not break apart but instead comes together in harmony

Renoir seeks to destroy the Lumière canvas for the sake of his family, not out of any grudge against the canvas itself or a desire to destroy it. On the contrary, he even directly says, ''I do not want to destroy the Lumière canvas, which is my son's keepsake.''

In other words, for Renoir in the final phase, the destruction of the canvas is merely a means to bring Maelle (+ Aline) into reality.

**1-2. Verso**  
Verso also wants two things.

(A) His eternal rest  
(B) The cure of Maelle’s canvas addiction

At the point when Aline is expelled from the canvas, Verso has no particular desires beyond these two. Even (B) is a very secondary goal. In fact, when Maelle opposes the destruction of the canvas, he immediately retracts his claim and encourages Maelle to live by going back and forth between reality and the canvas.

And when Verso is defeated by Maelle, even facing death, he earnestly says, ''I do not want this kind of life. Please let me stop drawing.'' This scene clearly reveals what Verso truly desires.

Of course, the presence of the ''Fading Boy'' must be considered. But the Fading Boy only says he is ''tired of drawing,'' not that he ''would commit suicide along with the canvas.'' Rather, he had consistently expressed joy in drawing and the desire to keep drawing until then. He just wanted to pause temporarily for the sake of the family.

Aline’s problem exists as well. However, since Aline has already been expelled from the canvas and Renoir and Maelle are able to control her, it is hard to see the destruction of the canvas as absolutely necessary. In fact, since Verso himself recognized this, he told Maelle to ''keep the canvas and come and go.''

In other words, what Verso truly desires in the final phase is only his own death. For him, the destruction of the Lumière canvas is merely a means to meet death.

**1-3. Maelle**  
What Maelle wants is the following two things.

(A) To live a happy life without pain inside the canvas  
(B) To continue maintaining the Lumière canvas, which she cares deeply about

└ 2-2. If Renoir attempts violence and succeeds in subduing

└ 2-3. If Verso attempts violence and fails to subdue

└ 2-4. If Verso attempts violence and succeeds in subduing

└ 2-5. If Maelle attempts violence and fails to subdue

└ 2-6. If Maelle attempts violence and succeeds in subduing

**2. The Risks of Violence As examined**

in Chapter 1, there is no major problem with what Renoir, Maelle, and Verso each desire. Verso’s case is somewhat ambiguous, but at least it is understandable. However, the decisive cause of the ending’s slide into tragedy lies not in what they wanted but in how they tried to get it. All three took an extreme stance of either ''all or nothing,'' physically trying to subdue the others, and that was the critical problem.

Attempts to subdue others by violence, even putting aside moral and ethical judgments, are essentially a poor strategy. Violence provokes emotional backlash and fierce resistance, and even if successful, one must bear considerable risks afterward. If it fails, not only does one completely lose their goal, but they may also face severe retaliation.

Such ''violent attempts at subjugation'' are especially risky in a three-party situation. This is because the strategy of two allies attacking one is relatively advantageous. In such cases, the winning probability for each ally rises significantly from 33.3% to 50%. Usually, the two relatively weaker individuals ally to subdue the strongest one, naturally because if a strong opponent remains, one’s chances of achieving their goal decrease accordingly. This is exactly how Mr. Renoir failed.

In real history, the instability of three-party systems and the risks of violence have been proven countless times through examples like the Roman Triumvirate, power struggles in ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms,'' game theory, and the ''three gunmen'' problem. The fact that Clair Obscur weaves this into its narrative is one of its strengths.

Now, let us specifically examine the risks Renoir, Verso, and Maelle faced when relying on violence, and how they made wrong choices.

**2-1. If Renoir uses violence and fails to subdue**  
In this case, Renoir will lose almost everything. First, his daughter Maelle will definitely become a 'corpse' inside the canvas, and the possibility of returning to reality disappears.

Moreover, since he failed to destroy the Lumière Canvas, it becomes impossible to prevent Aline from re-entering. If Aline enters the canvas again, Renoir may have to face both Maelle and Aline as enemies simultaneously.

Of course, in this situation, the reunion or harmony of the Desandre family is forever out of reach.

**2-2. If Renoir uses violence and succeeds in subduing**  
In this case, Renoir can temporarily achieve the result he wants. However, that is only *temporary*. Maelle has been driven away by physical violence without any awareness that she must live in reality or emotional acceptance. In such a state, she is highly likely to become obsessed with the canvas again.

Unless Maelle is confined and watched 24 hours a day, there is no way to prevent her from creating another canvas and getting absorbed in it. In fact, Alicia can create a new canvas behind Renoir’s eyes if she wants, and if necessary, run away from home to immerse herself in it. Many real addicts lose control and worsen exactly in this way. Moreover, Renoir must worry not only about Maelle but also about Aline.

That’s not all. There is also a high possibility that Maelle will develop hostility toward Renoir, causing the family relationship to completely collapse. In reality, drug addicts often express extreme anger toward family members who try to take away their drugs or cut off their supply.

This is somewhat clearly hinted at within the game. Maelle deeply resents Renoir’s controlling nature and openly points it out.

In the end, the ‘harmony of the Desandre family’ that Renoir truly hopes for has a very low chance of being realized even if he controls the situation with violence.

**2-3. If Verso used violence and failed to subdue**  
In this case, Verso loses everything. Not only does he fail to attain the eternal rest he so desires, but he becomes a ‘puppet’ playing the piano in pain.

Moreover, in this scenario, Maelle’s canvas addiction also sees no resolution.

Realistically, the possibility of Verso overpowering Maelle by force is low. The difference in their combat abilities is unclear, but Maelle is a Paintress who possesses godlike power inside the canvas. She can instantly kill Gommage or, conversely, revive someone killed by Gommage. Considering how she easily nullified the time freeze cast by Painted Alicia, it is highly likely she has the ability to manipulate time inside the canvas.

As a result, Verso’s attempt to subdue Maelle with violence was, regardless of its risk, a reckless gamble with very low chances of success from the start.

**2-4. If Verso used violence and succeeded in subduing**  
In this case, Verso betrays and kills everyone who trusted and loved him. This includes not just simple colleagues but Rune and Sciel, with whom he had sexual relations, and longtime friends Monoco and Esquiere.

Also, even in this case, he cannot cure or help Maelle’s canvas addiction. Just as breaking a crack pipe does not make an addict recover automatically, the situation can worsen. If Maelle falls into a new canvas, there will no longer be anyone like Verso to advise or scold her.

**2-5. If Maelle used violence and failed to subdue**  
In this case, Maelle loses both the Lumière Canvas and her life within it.

However, this does not mean she overcomes the pain of reality or escapes addiction. Therefore, it is highly likely she will soon wander in search of a new canvas. But since Maelle is still an inexperienced Paintress, it will take her a lot of time and effort to create a substitute canvas on her own. Alternatively, she might borrow a canvas made by another Paintress like Clea.

But whichever canvas she chooses, the new canvas will not contain the Expedition 33 she called ‘family.’ And this fact is likely to cause Maelle to suffer forever in longing.

**2-6. If Maelle uses violence and succeeds in subduing**  
In this case, Maelle leaves her family in reality and transforms Lumière into a puppet world for herself alone, where she ultimately ends her life.

Moreover, until Maelle breathes her last inside the Lumière canvas, she must endure the anxiety of not knowing when Renoir might change his mind and return. Renoir is a person who would do anything for his family without hesitation, has a strong authoritarian tendency to control in violent and extreme ways, and Maelle knows this better than anyone.

While Maelle slowly dies inside the Lumière canvas — in other words, while Maelle rapidly dies in the reality outside the canvas — Renoir, watching this with his own eyes, is likely to try again to bring Maelle back to reality. Maelle also knows this, so it is highly likely she cannot enjoy the Lumière canvas life she gained after sacrificing so much with peace of mind.

Of course, Renoir said he believes Maelle and will keep the lights on waiting, but that was said after he was beaten and driven away by Maelle. In fact, in the Verso ending, he neither waited for nor trusted Maelle. As soon as Maelle was expelled from the canvas, he burned down Lumière — as if mocking his own words.

**3. So then, what was the 'best method'?**

└ 3-1. Renoir

└ 3-2. Maelle

└ 3-3. Verso

└ 3-4. Could it really have been like this?

**3. So then, what was the 'best method'?**

First, let me say there is no perfect solution in any case. Such a thing simply does not exist in this world. But there definitely are 'better' solutions, and especially in the final phase, there could have been various better ways.

Of course, since the game's story is already completed and fixed, you might think discussing better solutions is meaningless. But I think differently. When we enter the world of a game and experience it, it is fine to simply have fun, but I also think it is meaningful to ponder questions like 'What would have been the best choice?' or 'What would I have done in that situation?' Such reflection may provide hints or comfort when dealing with problems we face in real life.

Therefore, below I will write my thoughts on what the 'best solution' might have been. Of course, this is not an absolute answer, and better choices might have existed. I do not hide the wish to see better solutions, and I will look at the solutions and possible compromises for each character.

**3-1. Renoir**  
The most reasonable choice Renoir can make is to compromise with Maelle and preserve the Lumière canvas, while encouraging her to try to balance her life between reality and the canvas.

If Renoir succeeds in compromise:

The risk of Maelle’s canvas addiction is greatly reduced. The danger of the canvas arises when someone becomes excessively immersed and stays 'too long.' Renoir himself has created numerous canvases and spent time in them without major problems. In other words, if Maelle steps out of the Lumière canvas occasionally to have recovery time, the risk is minimal.

Also, Maelle will feel deep gratitude toward her father for accepting her wishes and withdrawing from destroying the canvas. The hostility that arises from forcibly dragging her out by violence and bringing her back to reality will also disappear. Therefore, the possibility of family recovery increases accordingly.

Additionally, Renoir gains another advantage. The burden of monitoring Maelle is reduced, allowing him to focus fully on Aline. This lessens his burden and raises the chance of preventing Aline’s unpredictable actions, further improving the family’s chances of recovery.

A small benefit is that he does not have to destroy the keepsakes of his deceased son. 

\-

The condition Renoir needs to propose is simple. He can just say to Maelle, 'I will not destroy the canvas for now, so calm down first, take your time to settle your mind, then come out and talk with me.'

When Verso made a similar proposal to Maelle, she rejected it, fearing that once she came out, Renoir would immediately burn the canvas. Conversely, if Renoir firmly promises not to destroy the canvas, Maelle has sufficient reason to return to reality.

Of course, Maelle might still act spoiled and remain in the canvas, but Renoir can strongly urge compromise through the threat of destroying the canvas. Like when children plead, 'Please, just 5 more minutes!' or 'I’ll finish this stage and come out!' and parents respond with a quiet ‘tsk...’ warning.

\-

Moreover, Renoir does not necessarily need to compromise with Verso. Verso’s desire is for complete peace, so Renoir only needs to offer that condition. Of course, Renoir can promise to care for Maelle, Aline, and the people in Lumière if Verso cooperates. This would be a proposal difficult for Verso to refuse.

Furthermore, in this case, Rune and Sciel are likely to support persuading Maelle. They would not easily bet on a situation where everyone, including themselves, is at risk by being defeated by violence. The moment Renoir withdraws from destroying the Lumière canvas, they lose any grounds to oppose Maelle’s return to reality. After all, if the Lumière canvas remains intact, Maelle can always return and meet them.

**3-2. Maelle**  
The most rational choice Maelle can make is to compromise with Renoir and treat the Lumière Canvas as a hobby she enjoys for a few hours each day.

If Maelle spends four hours (240 minutes) a day inside the Canvas, she can experience about 400 hours (about 20 days) in the Canvas. Then, if she returns to reality and spends 20 hours (1,200 minutes) in reality, about 2,000 hours (120,000 minutes), or roughly three months (83.25 days), will pass inside the Canvas.

Alternatively, if she indulges and spends 10 hours (600 minutes) a day in the Canvas, she will spend 41 days inside the Canvas but skip 58 days in reality. The Maelle in the real world does not experience those 58 days at all. In reality, it is just as if she slept one night.

Maelle might want to be even more greedy. After all, she is a 16-year-old girl, and due to the severe nature of her third-degree burns, she cannot go to school or go outside. Doing so would risk infection and immediate death. Moreover, considering the late 19th-century France setting, if she went outside, she would likely be treated as mentally ill, a witch, or a monster, and be pelted with stones or spit at, or even arrested.

Therefore, if Maelle sleeps 8 hours a day and spends 2 hours eating and with her family, and spends all the remaining time in the Canvas, she will spend 58 days in the Canvas, return to reality to sleep, and the next morning can enter the Canvas again after 41 days have passed there.

Of course, these methods are not as good as spending ‘all day’ with her friends, but if she refuses even such small compromises, the cost Maelle must pay is ‘her own death’ or ‘the complete disappearance of her friends.’ Therefore, balancing between reality and the Canvas is the best choice.

\-

Additionally, Renoir or Maelle likely have the ability to stop or regulate the flow of time inside the Lumière Canvas. Painted Renoir and Painted Alicia had the ability to stop time, and Maelle was also able to make stopped time flow again with a simple gesture.

Of course, since the wind blows, leaves fall, and people’s hair moves even when time is stopped, it is not a ‘perfect’ time stop. But at least human time appears to be completely stopped. Watching Painted Renoir and Painted Alicia freeze the 33 Expedition team and move and talk for more than 10 minutes, if it were a real time stop, everyone except Verso would have suffocated to death.

Therefore, it is very likely that Maelle can slow down or stop the flow of time inside the Canvas, and if she stops time when she does not enter the Canvas, all problems are solved.

In this case:

(A) The fading becomes comfortably restful

(B) Maelle can play with her friends ‘all day,’

(C) Maelle can forget physical pain through the Canvas and achieve emotional recovery and affectionate exchange

Literally, everyone becomes happy. Like a beneficial function of the game.

For this happy ending, Maelle must persuade Renoir. Verso has already presented a similar compromise proposal to Maelle, so only Renoir needs to be persuaded.

\-

There are three main conditions Maelle can propose to Renoir.

(A)Family Harmony

What Renoir wants is not just the family gathered in one place, but for them to love and harmonize with each other. The biggest obstacle is Maelle. She has suffered emotional abuse from her mother and sister, has been blamed for the real Verso’s death, and did not know her father Renoir’s love. There is even a suggestion that she is more interested in writing than the family trade of painting.

Therefore, harmony in the Desandre family can only be possible when Maelle actively approaches Aline, Clea, and Renoir and tries to improve their relationships. Maelle can propose this as a compromise, which would be very attractive to Renoir.

(B) Supporting Aline’s Recovery

Aline’s physical health has deteriorated severely from Canvas addiction, and her mental health is even more serious. Although Aline’s appearances in the game are too few to give a precise diagnosis, it is certain that she has a serious mental illness.

This is a great hardship for Renoir, who deeply loves his family. Maelle can propose to actively help Renoir with this. For example, blocking their mother from entering the Canvas when Renoir is distracted, comforting the mother with affection to heal emotional wounds, and mediating between family members. These are things only Maelle, the youngest daughter of the Desandre family, can do. This condition would also be very attractive to Renoir.

(C) Suicide Prevention

Often, to achieve a proper compromise, one must present not only positive benefits but also negative risks if negotiations fail. Adding a gun to kind words can gain more than kind words alone.

Maelle can explain to Renoir the deep despair she would fall into if he destroys the Canvas, making him hesitate. Just as Aline fell into despair after losing Verso, Maelle will also fall into great despair if she loses the Canvas and her family.

At the last moment, Maelle tries to explain this to Renoir, but she is still a young child with poor speaking skills and undeveloped social skills, so she cannot explain it properly.

On the other hand, if Maelle more clearly pointed out the danger of the situation, Renoir might reconsider, thinking, ‘Hmm... wait, this might not be a good idea.’

Also, if Maelle hints at joining forces with Verso to chase out Renoir and commit suicide inside the Canvas, Renoir is even more likely to rethink his plan.

**3-3. Verso**  
The most rational choice Verso can make is to help mediate a compromise between Maelle and Renoir.

Within the game, there are other beings with immortality like Verso. These are Painted Renoir and Painted Alicia, who each die as Gommage to Renoir and Maelle respectively. Renoir himself attempts to pay Gommage to Verso early in Act 3 as a means of giving him rest. Also, when Verso enters the mirror space where the Fading Boy resides, he is slowly being paid Gommage to, and Maelle stops him, warning that it is dangerous.

Considering this, Verso is unlikely to die from general area-effect indiscriminate tribute, but is highly likely to die from tribute techniques used specifically and precisely by the painters. In other words, he can possibly find rest 1) be Gommage by Renoir, or 2) by Maelle, or 3) by being idle in the mirror space.

The important point here is that after Verso dies from being paid tribute, it must also be prevented that he comes back to life. In fact, in the Maelle ending, Verso is paid tribute to by Maelle and vanishes, but she resurrects him again.

\-

At this point, Verso has no conditions to propose to Renoir. Therefore, the best outcome for him is to mediate between Renoir and Maelle.

Renoir holds deep feelings for Verso. Verso is a copy of his son, carefully created by Aline, has suffered for a long time because of the Desandre family, and Renoir himself has apologized to him in the name of the family. Thus, Renoir is likely to take Verso’s words seriously because of his affection and guilt toward him.

Maelle’s feelings toward Verso are a complex mixture of the reliable presence of an uncle, the tenderness of an older brother, and the sexual attraction toward an adult man, resulting in a very deep overall affection. Therefore, Maelle is also likely to seriously consider Verso’s proposal.

Especially, Verso is a person with a sexy appearance, neat manners, a romantic atmosphere soaked in melancholy, and a skillful way with words to captivate, deceive, and manipulate others. Even Sciel and Lunejo were completely captivated by him and offered to initiate sexual relations first.

Moreover, Verso’s mediation involves additional stakes of his own true rest and Maelle’s salvation, giving him enough motivation to risk his life to persuade Renoir and Maelle.

**4. Could They Have Reached the Best Answer?**

└ 4-1. Possibility of Compromise

└ 4-2. Methods of Compromise

└ 4-3. If Compromise Fails

└ 4-4. Possibility of Maelle’s Canvas Addiction Improving

**4. Could They Have Reached the Best Answer?**

As examined above in section 3, if all three had each taken just one step toward compromise, they could have easily reached a happy ending for everyone. If even one among the three had listened to all the stories of their loved ones instead of suppressing them violently, a lot could have changed.

Of course, one might wonder, *‘Is such a compromise realistically possible?’* If so, it is necessary to examine whether that compromise is ‘realistically’ possible.

**4-1. Possibility of Compromise**  
In the real world, we often see people pursuing common interests or making small concessions to achieve the greatest happiness. Of course, there are also many cases where people reject each other and mutually destroy themselves. Especially those engrossed in game theory concepts like 'prisoner’s dilemma' and Nash equilibrium often claim that ""humans will inevitably betray if the gain from betrayal is large."" But is that really true? It is not.

In reality, the total gain from cooperation is always greater than the total gain from betrayal, which leads to concessions and compromises. This is because the real world is a space where countless people interact simultaneously, and a single act of betrayal can prevent future cooperation from many others.

Of course, if one person is overwhelmingly powerful—for example, one rich individual among many poor people, or a superpower nation among several impoverished countries—the 'balance of power' breaks down, and the predictions of game theory come into play.

Therefore, moderate concessions and negotiations require two conditions for both sides: 1) the gain obtained through concession and 2) the loss suffered if betrayal occurs. Without the first, the need for negotiation disappears; without the second, the possibility of betrayal increases.

As you might have guessed from the mention of game theory so far, the compromise plan I proposed in section 3 has a two-track structure of 1) concession and cooperation conditions and 2) betrayal and punishment conditions to enable tit-for-tat. Both Renoir and Maelle have favorable terms to offer each other and ways to retaliate if the other betrays them. Therefore, from a theoretical standpoint, the possibility of cooperation is very high—assuming they think carefully and act accordingly.

Ah, what about Verso? Verso’s position is different. He has no conditions to offer. In reality, in such cases, a third party often mediates between the two and gains benefits. Sometimes the mediator gains even more than the two parties. This frequently happens in human or international relations. If you just thought of a country that starts with 'S' and ends with 'S,' you are correct.

\-

Also, there is a thought that ""humans are emotional animals, so cooperation is impossible."" This is a very foolish idea, firstly because humans possess reason stronger than emotion, and secondly because the instinct to avoid a 'Mexican standoff' exists even before reason.

Let’s look at emotions first: negative emotions such as anger, hatred, and jealousy often worsen situations. Many people misunderstand that the 'mind' is a single entity that changes in real-time, but in fact, hundreds of thousands of switches in the brain turn on and off depending on the situation to make judgments. Anger and hatred are just types of amygdala responses, more like neural reactions than concrete entities. Therefore, if handled calmly and patiently, reason can soothe these emotions.

If you have read the previous columns, you might have seen mentions of the survival mode that activates amygdala responses and suppresses frontal lobe responses, causing humans to become enraged—this is the fight-or-flight switch. Yes, that’s why all good negotiations are basically done after eating well, sleeping enough, and calming the mind comfortably and leisurely. Only then can the prefrontal cortex be fully activated, enabling rational and high-level thinking.

The three people at the final stage have emotions and stubbornness, but they also possess reason. They also have enough time and a conducive environment for conversation. Therefore, it is difficult to say that the possibility of compromise completely vanished due to momentary emotions. I will explain this more in detail below.

\-

Secondly, avoiding the ""Mexican standoff"" is an instinctive reaction. What we call reason or emotion is actually a kind of 'judgment system' developed to continue the species in the natural world. And 'instinct' is also a part of that judgment system.

Things like finding symmetrical faces beautiful, disgust toward spiders or snakes, attraction to sexual appeal, desire for tasty food, pursuit of happiness, and avoidance of unhappiness are all part of a vast process for survival and gene transmission.

Even animals, which we say lack 'reason' and act only on instinct, still judge when to attack, when to defend, or when to compromise.

On the plains, hyenas often eat leftovers from lions. If hyenas try to forcibly take the lion’s prey, fights break out. If many members die in these fights, survival becomes difficult afterward. Conversely, lions also yield leftover food to hyenas because lions risk injury or danger to their young or weak members when fighting hyenas.

Simply put, whether human or beast, everyone instinctively tries to avoid a 'Mexican standoff' because, in many cases, such a standoff ends in mutual destruction—a fact understandable even without reason.

The most famous real-world example of avoiding a ""Mexican standoff"" is the Cold War. Everyone feared nuclear war, so despite the production of many nuclear missiles, they were never launched.

Thus, at the level of instinct before emotion, humans possess the instinct to avoid the worst-case scenario. This clearly indicates the 'possibility of compromise,' so the claim that 'humans are emotional animals, so compromise is impossible' is not logically valid.

\-

Moreover, Renoir, Maelle, and Verso do not hate, resent, or rage against each other. All their instincts, emotions, and reason are seeking the possibility of compromise.

The problem is that the situation becomes complicated when the three suddenly act selfishly, overpower the others with violence, or behave like mentally ill people trying to ruin the situation. Frankly speaking, this part is very artificial narratively. It is not necessarily inevitable. I will deal with this narrative issue more thoroughly in column #6, so let’s leave it here for now.

**4-2. Methods of Compromise**  
Earlier, I said that ''they have enough time and favorable conditions for dialogue.'' In reality, cooperation often fails not because of issues of reason or emotion, but due to a lack of time and suitable conditions. In that sense, their possibility of compromise can be considered significantly high.

The way they utilize the given time and conditions is as follows:  
(1) Renoir and Maelle slowly put down the knives they aimed at each other, kick them far away beyond their reach, then relieve the tense atmosphere between them by sharing embraces, kisses, and smiles.

(2) They spend time together enjoying a vacation on String Meadow coast, playing catch, ping pong, obstacle courses, building sandcastles, and other recreational activities to understand each other sufficiently. However, volleyball must be excluded. In this worldview, volleyball excessively damages a person’s character. Less difficult and less stressful activities would be better.

(3) After enough rest, they prepare a large blackboard, sweet snacks, and fragrant coffee to hold a workshop where each explains their claims and reasons in detail to find a point of compromise. Perhaps a better plan than the one I suggested might emerge.

(4) The Lumière citizens, including Rune and Sciel, can do their best to ensure this event proceeds joyfully because this issue is directly linked to the world’s survival. The only thing they must be careful about is refraining from serious crimes such as offering alcohol to Maelle, who is only sixteen.

(5) Verso mediates between Renoir and Maelle and acts as the workshop moderator, while playing music with Rune to create a good atmosphere. In fact, his role is the most important—more the mediation than the playing.

Even if the entire process takes about three months, it is no problem. Those three months (100 days) are only a single day in reality.

**4-3. If Compromise Fails**  
Of course, in reality, unpredictable and outrageous events often occur without any plausibility, so the above compromise plan cannot be guaranteed to succeed. The compromise possibility and method I mentioned are merely indications of possibility, not certainties.

However, if one tries their best to compromise and still fails, the risks are much, almost entirely reduced compared to attempting violent suppression. As repeatedly mentioned in previous columns, when a person in a dangerous situation is treated aggressively, there is a higher chance of panic, hatred, or extreme behavior. Actually, the game proceeded that way too.

Many police officers in various countries receive training or are advised by seniors on the scene: when someone behaves dangerously and must be stopped, immediately aiming a gun and shouting ''Hands up, you bastard!'' risks escalating into the worst scenario (e.g., a shootout).

Therefore, unless the current situation is already the worst-case scenario (such as an ongoing shootout), even if the situation worsens and the worst is imminent, gently conveying friendly and empathetic words like ''Don't misunderstand, I only want to help you,'' ''Friend, I have children,'' or ''It’s still reversible; no fatal problems have occurred'' acts as a powerful safety mechanism to prevent catastrophe.

Many people in danger, on the brink of self-destructive or irreversible actions, regain restraint just by hearing one warm phrase like ''Uh... wait, this doesn’t seem like a good idea.'' And at the last moment, even a three-second hesitation can change a lot.

\-

Furthermore, these compromise attempts are excellent not only at avoiding a ''Mexican standoff'' to prevent the worst outcome but also greatly reduce the likelihood of cruel retaliation that often follows defeat by violence.

For example, if Renoir has made sufficient efforts to compromise before losing in violence, Maelle is very likely to return to reality even briefly. This is because the justification for Maelle’s extreme and destructive ''isolated death inside the canvas'' choice—that if she leaves, Renoir will burn the canvas—disappears. Therefore, after calming down sufficiently, she may change her mind, and those around her have more chances to persuade her.

If Maelle has tried to compromise enough before losing in violence, Renoir is likely to reconsider multiple times before destroying the canvas. He also feels uneasy about how Aline and Maelle might change after destroying it, and emotionally he does not want to destroy the canvas, which is a memento of his deceased son. Moreover, there is a possibility that he will take the best course by helping Maelle protect the Lumière canvas from Aline and by monitoring and aiding Aline’s recovery.

Though less so than the above two cases, if Verso has tried enough to compromise before losing in violence, Maelle is more likely to treat him better than with the ''broken puppet doll'' punishment. She might treat him so he does not suffer, or instead of completely Gommage-ing him, might just stop time for him. There are many methods. How it is done is just a means; what matters is Maelle’s willingness to help him and ease his suffering.

**4-4. The Possibility of Maelle’s Canvas Addiction Improving**  
Many people say *‘Maelle’s canvas addiction is like drug addiction, and it can only be cured by destroying the Lumière canvas.’* I also compared Maelle’s canvas addiction to drug addiction in a previous column.

However, real drugs and the canvas do not correspond one-to-one. The canvas does not cause addiction simply by use like real drugs do, nor does a single use damage the nervous system or internal organs.

The danger of the canvas only arises when someone *‘excessively’* indulges in it and stays *‘too long.’* Renoir created many canvases and spent time inside them without any problem because he fundamentally recognized that it is a *‘type of virtual reality (for example, a game),’* understood the *‘obvious fact’* that it must not erode reality, and enjoyed it as a safe play.

For example, real games are as safe as the canvas, but there are quite a few cases where people become addicted to games, leading to their lives falling apart or even death. These addicts do not only have the options of *‘facing reality and quitting all games’* or *‘just dying inside the game.’* They can clearly reduce their game use and find a balance with reality. Many doctors and scholars research this, and the reason the WHO classified gaming addiction as a disease code lies here. The important point I emphasize is the very clear fact that none of these researchers propose *‘forcibly taking away and smashing the gaming devices’* as a treatment.

\-

Whether it is drugs, games, or anything else, humans are beings capable of attachment and obsession. For example, the reason many people fail at dieting is *physically* exactly the same as why they cannot voluntarily quit drugs. Dopamine activated when blood sugar spikes gives them happiness (a sugar high), and when that is abruptly cut off, it causes terrible pain (a sugar crash), which is why despite many diet foods and methods, most still fail at dieting.

The only way to overcome this and succeed at dieting is through the person’s own effort. If you confiscate all their food, they will find ways to get food by any means and may even resort to physical violence in the process. Only the person themselves can control their desire, and interference by others tends to significantly increase the likelihood of diet failure due to emotional backlash.

The mechanism of what is called *‘withdrawal symptoms from attachment (or adrenaline withdrawal symptoms)’* that occur when a human has attachment to something and then loses it happens exactly the same whether the attachment is to drugs, alcohol, coffee, food, games, or a loved person. The difference is that drugs can affect dopamine much more directly, rapidly, and violently than anything else.

Therefore, unlike real drugs, the *‘relatively safe’* canvas life is more likely to be treated by gradually reducing time spent going back and forth between the canvas and reality. In that case, the canvas could become a wonderful hobby that temporarily lets Maelle forget the pain of reality. Renoir is living proof of that.

\-----

  
**In conclusion,** both of the tragic endings in this game were entirely avoidable, and there was clearly a possibility of reaching a better outcome. Of course, they did not achieve that, but I hope that those of you reading this—regardless of the method—can reach a better conclusion in any situation.

As you may have sensed while reading the main text, I consider Renoir to be the character who bears the greatest responsibility for this series of tragedies. Verso had too little authority or duty to change the situation, and Maelle was too young. Renoir is the oldest of the three, a father, and the person with the most power and authority. Therefore, he should have approached the situation more cautiously and with a more open attitude than anyone else.

Of course, it cannot be denied that Renoir also suffered deeply from the family tragedy and the Canvas problem. However, it is equally clear that such suffering does not grant him an exemption from blame.

If Renoir were a real person, I would say to him:

*“Please, if you love your family, care about them, listen to their stories, and try to compromise with them. I agree that this is not always possible, but at least when you are in the middle of violently trying to seize and burn the belongings of your dead son, believe me, you absolutely, definitely must try to compromise first!”*

It was a warm spring afternoon when Daniel and some of his coworkers enter the small coffee shop. The group of men had pasted the small local multiple times without paying attention to it but things were different today. A small billboard sign had caught their attention as it said: „One year anniversary. All coffees for one pound“. The group of men entered the local and sat down at one of the free tables. Daniel was the only one to not sit down as he walked over to the counter, facing the barista. 

„Hey, could you make us four coffees please?“ he asked while smiling at the woman. The sign on her shirt gave away that her name was Lisa. „Sure just give me a moment“ Lisa replied as she returned the smile. Daniel was immediately caught up by the barista’s beauty as he couldn’t keep his eyes of her while she took care of his order. His mind was racing like crazy, trying to find a way to ask Lisa out without being inappropriate. Unfortunately he didn’t came up with a good pick up line and once they were about leave the local he decided to go for a desperate move. Daniel wrote down his phone number on one of the napkins and left a five pound bill as tip. Later that day Daniel received a text message from an unknown number…
——————————————————————————

Hello! Thank your for reading the introduction to my post, I hoped it caught your interest. I‘m looking to find a detailed partner who’s interested in setting up and playing a longterm story between two people with different backgrounds falling in love with each other. Daniel was born into a wealthy family, his farther is the CEO of an important tech company. While going to college Daniel is already working in his farther‘s company to gain experience to take over as CEO one day. Lisa‘s parents never had a lot of money and after saving money their whole life her farther finally fulfilled his dream of opening up a coffee house. Lisa is working in the local to help her parents. 

Something I’d really like to include is that Daniel‘s parents aren’t liking Lisa and her relationship with their son. They think she’s not good enough for him and maybe even try to sabotage their relationship. Apart from that I’d love to play out their dates, cute moments in their daily life and such things. 

If you’re having any questions or suggestions feel free to tell me about them. I’m looking forward to hear from you!",1,1748805823.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

The soap has a great scent, actually I think its better than the lotion and balm. I didnt realise I ordered a puck and I dont have a bowl for it so its now resting in one of my coffee mugs in which it fits perfectly.

Overall great shave today, definitely will keep repeating for a week or two.

1l0xd1k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0xd1k,Some pics and tips from my trip to Melbourne,"I visited Melbourne recently as part of a college trip but chose to explore the city mostly on my own. Thought I would share some practical tips and a few pictures that might help others planning to travel there.

From public transport and shopping to small cultural surprises, here are a few things I picked up along the way that could be useful if you are heading to Melbourne for the first time

1. Buy sunscreens because the quality is way better compared to the ones sold here.
2. Drink tap water as it is completely safe. Bottled water costs around 200 rupees for 600 ml but if you must buy it, get a bulk pack from Coles or Woolworths where each bottle costs around 60 cents. 
3. You are not allowed to carry drinks in check in baggage. If you bought alcohol from Delhi duty free and have a layover in Singapore, Malaysia or Thailand, they will likely make you throw it. Liquids above 100 ml are not allowed unless purchased from duty free there itself.
4. Google Maps works great for trams. Alternatively, you can use PTV app for more accurate details of public transport. You only need a Myki card outside the free tram zone. Public transport is cheap and well connected.
5. Queen Victoria Market is great for souvenirs, leather jackets (₹4–5K), and food. If you are on a budget, Ibis Therry Street nearby is a solid stay option as it’s located in the heart of CBD. It’s very close to state library as well. 
6. Set a full day aside for shopping at DFO South Wharf and H and M on Elizabeth Street. I found Nike running shoes that cost ₹16k in India for just ₹5.5k there. Got a ₹24k Ralph Lauren sweater for ₹9K as well. It’s completely original.
7. Don’t forget to visit the thrift stores. 
8. St Kilda is popular but slightly overhyped. Brighton Beach is cleaner, quieter and has the famous colorful beach houses.
9. Most shops and restaurants close by 6 or 7 PM. If you are used to Indian cities where shopping continues late into the night, this feels strange at first. Plan your shopping and dinner early.
10. 7 Eleven coffee for one dollar is honestly good. Chemist Warehouse is the best place for affordable skincare, perfumes, and medicines. You can drink tap water there.
11. Learn the currency basics as the two dollar coin is smaller than the one dollar coin and it can be confusing at first.
12. Don’t forget to carry a portable bidet. They are life savers.
13. Carry your student ID if you have one. You get discounts at museums, stores, and rides. 
14. Beer cans are cheaper than bottled water. I don’t think I need to say more.  
15. An Indian driving license is valid for six months. You do not need an international driving permit if you are visiting short term.
16. Flinders street is very beautiful at night but beware of junkies.
17. Even if the temperature is 10 to 15 degrees, Melbourne winters feel really cold due to the wind. Pack layers and a good jacket. Also the weather changes quickly. It can be sunny one moment and raining the next. Always carry an umbrella or poncho in your bag.
18. For SIM cards, boost is a great option as it offers unlimited calls to India and enough data for a short vacation.

Physically, mentally, emotionally — I feel completely broken. My joints keep popping, especially in my knees, and I have no idea if I’m sick or just falling apart for no reason. I have dilated veins on my scrotum and penis, bilateral varicocele, and what feels like Peyronie’s disease (I can feel two hard cord-like plaques and there’s a visible curve and indentation in my penis). It’s humiliating and terrifying.
I also have spider veins on my chest, broken capillaries on legs, dilated veins on the white of my eyes (sclera), dry eye syndrome, and the beginnings of varicose veins — and all of this at just 24 years old.
I used to look good. There was a time I was fit, confident, and even considered modeling. But everything started going downhill after varicocele and inguinal hernia surgery. My life changed completely.
On top of that, I’ve made mistakes too. I abused pre-workout, Xanax, phenibut, and other substances just to cope. I didn t know how to deal with the pressure and depression. Now I’m clean — just coffee — but the damage feels done.
Emotionally I have no close friends. I have no beautiful memories to look back on, except the times when I had money and some sense of stability. My last relationship - we tried twice — but it failed badly both times.
My parents don’t get it. They think it’s all in my head. They’re religious and all they tell me is to go to church, pray more, be grateful. But how can I feel grateful when I feel like a ruined version of who I used to be?

1l0x7bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1l0x7bg/deleted_dating_apps_whats_next/,"Deleted dating apps, what’s next?","I (21M) am realizing I’ve become dependent on dating apps since I’ve gotten out of high school. I can’t tell you how many times I’ll feel lonely, download the apps, realize they’re a waste of time, and delete them to just repeat the process the next time I get the urge to. I just deleted them again, and I never want to redownload them, but without them I feel like I’m making no progress towards finding a relationship. 

I think it’s important to start by saying I live in a small city, it only takes a couple days of swiping at a time and I’ll run out of people to swipe on, it’s one of the biggest issues with the apps in my area, and it doesn’t make them feel worth it except for that initial rush of making a profile and getting those initial likes. I wouldn’t say I have any issues getting likes, it’s that everyone I match with just seems completely uninterested. I’m a bit over 6’, somewhat muscular, doing an engineering degree, and in terms of facial looks I’d say I’m probably average. Even saying that makes me feel like I’m bragging, I definitely have my own collection of issues and insecurities, but on paper it seems like I’m good enough for a lot of people, even ones I’d consider out of my league, to swipe right on me. I’m a pretty quiet person unless I get to know someone well or I’m really interested in them. 

Out of all my matches, probably over half either I don’t message or they don’t respond to my opening message. Out of the ones that do, there’s either no text chemistry so things die off, or they disappear once the idea of a date comes up. I’ve only been on two first dates from the apps, the first girl we had 2 great dates but she messaged me after and said she wasn’t ready for a relationship, the other we had an ok first date and she ghosted me a day after when I suggested a second. I’m currently talking to one girl that I exchanged contact info with a few days before I deleted them, I just asked if she wanted to grab a coffee not even an hour ago so we’ll see where that goes. Overall my main issues with apps is that they feel too much like a game, hardly anyone takes them serious, and there’s not enough people in my area for them to be viable. 

I don’t really know how to find someone without them. I know people say to join clubs and do activities, but I feel doing that just with the sole intent of meeting people would be weird, and my schedule doesn’t really allow it. Right now I pretty much go to classes, the gym, and back to my apartment. 

I’ve also never cold approached anyone, mostly because of how much could go wrong when doing so. On top of this, I don’t really know if I’m attractive enough to do so. For all I know maybe I’m drop dead gorgeous or straight up ugly, I’ve never had a clear idea of what my standards should be.

My rent is $909/mo. The leases are individual, so if someone moves out, your rent still stays the same! All utilities are included except for electricity, which for me is usually around $12/mo. You are charged for the electricity you use in your room, and the electricity used in the common spaces is divided evenly among the four apartment mates.

The neighborhood is extremely walkable, and I have lived here comfortably for a year without a car. On-site parking is an additional $100/mo, but my roommates with vehicles have been able to consistently find street parking within a 5 minute walk of the building (downtown parking is free after 6pm!).

Pets are also allowed at an additional monthly fee and deposit. However, this fee is waived if it is a service or emotional support animal!

The lockable room is located in a unit with 4 total bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It has a nice view of State Street, greenery, and some cool buildings! You would share a full bathroom (one sink, lots of storage, shower/bath combo) with one other person. The living room and kitchen are very spacious and comfortable (you can easily cook with others in the kitchen!). The apartment complex includes a gym, lots of lounge/study spaces, a rooftop deck, a secure bike storage room, and a large communal laundry room.

The unit is fully furnished with the following:
BEDROOM
- a full bed frame
- a full mattress
- a three-drawer dresser
- a 3x2 desk
- a rolling chair
LIVING ROOM
- a couch
- a flat screen TV
- a TV stand
- a couch
- a lounge chair
- two coffee tables

I currently live with three other 20 year old WWU students, all women. I’m looking for someone who identifies as a woman and is within the 18-22 age range.

I recently tried creating a mock crime scene using household items just to explore the basics of BPA and test my observational skills.

I used a mix of ketchup, coffee, and water to simulate blood inside a bathtub. The setup included two bloody transfer handprints on the side of the tub, positioned as if someone was trying to catch themselves while falling. On the left side, I added some cast-off patterns, which I believe suggest that the attacker was right-handed. Toward the far end of the tub, I placed heavier blotches to simulate a final blunt force trauma to the head, which I imagined was the fatal blow.

Unfortunately, I don’t have photos to share, but I’d love any feedback. Does the scene setup make sense from a forensic perspective? Are there things I could improve or try next time?

Any advice or suggestions from people in the field would mean a lot. Thanks in advance.",2,1748805101.0,forensics,0,1.0,False
1l0x5ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMen/comments/1l0x5ec/call_me_crazy_i_lived_in_saudi_arabia_for_nearly/,"Call me crazy — I lived in Saudi Arabia for nearly 3 years, and this is my experience as a gay man in one of the most conservative countries in the world","When I first moved to Saudi, I thought I could suppress my desires. I told myself: you’ll be fine, you don’t need to act on anything. But then the loneliness hit. Eventually, I gave in and downloaded some dating apps — all anonymously, of course. Being openly gay there is dangerous. You can be persecuted for it, and that’s no exaggeration.

To my surprise, I started getting a lot of messages — not just from expats, but from local Saudis too. And honestly? They were way wilder than I expected. I’ll say this upfront: Saudi men are hot. But also? A lot of them were… just dumb.

Maybe it’s cultural. Where I come from, when you open a dating app, people usually state what they’re looking for — whether it’s friendship, casual, or something serious. If you meet, it’s likely in a public space first — you talk, see if there’s chemistry. In Saudi? Nope. They jump straight to asking you to come to their apartment. Sex first, talk later — or never.

Some would pretend to be sweet, saying they just wanted to “hang out” or “be friends,” but then they’d refuse to meet anywhere public. I found that suspicious as hell. Like — why are you so against grabbing coffee first? I’m not going to meet a total stranger in a private space in a country where being gay is criminalized. What if he’s a setup? A catfish? Or worse — a serial killer?

Another thing I noticed: many Saudi men are what you’d call “bi-curious.” Due to strict gender segregation from a young age, a lot of them grow up with no healthy access to women, so they explore with men — usually very specific types: feminine, fair-skinned, smooth-bodied guys. They want a “femboy” look — and they’re usually very dominant and masculine (or at least want to be seen that way).

One Saudi guy I chatted with told me he couldn’t be seen in public with an Asian man because our city was too small — everyone knew each other, and people would assume he was gay just for being seen with me. But a Kuwaiti friend of mine (also Arab) called BS on that. He said it’s not about fear — it’s just racism. That if they really wanted to, they could easily say they met you through a football club or a book community, and even wear a thobe (the traditional Saudi robe) to blend in. But they don’t. Because they don’t want to be seen with you — they just want to use you. To them, you’re just a body. A hole.

I didn’t know who to believe, but my Kuwaiti friend wasn’t entirely wrong.

Another shocker: unsafe sex is rampant. One-night stands with no protection at all. I kept wondering: if they’re so afraid of committing to one partner because of how forbidden gay relationships are, why not at least stick to one discreet partner for sex? Why this reckless rotation of strangers? It honestly felt animalistic.

And yet, despite all this, I became more curious about Saudi men’s sexuality — how it works, what shapes their desires, and why they think and act the way they do. It turned into a kind of study for me. I wanted to understand them, not just sleep with them.

Living there for three years, I’ve had more LGBTQ-related stories and experiences than I can count. Maybe if this post interests people, I’ll share more another time.

I know this story might be controversial — I’m sure at least one person reading this is Saudi. I want to be clear: I’m not generalizing. I’m just telling my story, my experiences.

And honestly? I’m just so, so grateful to be out of that country.",3,1748805073.0,GayMen,1,1.0,False

It could be in person, but I guess for now, virtual muna. Discord, maybe? I work in the morning, and ang bilis kong antukin or tamarin mag work kapag wala akong nakakausap. 

I also study, after my work, so pwede ring study budy. For this, I usually get out of my comfort zone. Go to coffee shops, bring my laptop/ study materials with me.   


For now, any kind of positive distractions would really help. We could talk anything under the sun. I'm kind of open-minded so I appreciate everyone's forthrightness din.

You’ve got proper sit-down spots, quick coffee options, and a few places that blur the line between café and deli — all within walking distance of the market square.

*Browns* is probably the one people mention first — part café, part deli, and fully Deddington. It’s good for coffee, light lunch, and the kind of pastry that makes you linger a bit longer than planned. They do a decent flat white and the counter’s usually piled with things you don’t need but somehow end up buying.

Across the square, *Eagles* has a bit more of a traditional tearoom feel. Less minimalism, more sponge cake and conversation. Handy if you’ve got older family visiting or just want something quiet and warm.

There’s also *Forge House Bakery* tucked just round the corner — they’ve built a bit of a following. Not loads of seats, but the coffee’s solid and the bread is serious business. Their filled focaccias are borderline too good.

If you’re up early or out walking, the Co-op does a surprisingly passable takeaway coffee too, and the little bench outside can be all you need on a sunny morning.

Hello my friends,

  
We are 70+ pages deep so far, and it's barely been more than a week. I've always wanted to write a book, and I guess now I have y'all to thank! Too bad it's not one I could ever publish lol, but we're still having a great time.

“Because who the fuck else?” Bryce groaned loudly. Her rage simmered into a dull, pulsing roar, like it had its own heartbeat. “Please don’t make me keep asking questions.”



“I don’t have many answers,” Azriel admitted. 



“What does that even *mean*?” Bryce whimpered with closed eyes. She needed to go back to bed two hours ago.



“He began visiting my dreams. He would show me flashes of what I now realize was your world. He showed me the Daglan and their conquests. He showed me horrors and wonders I couldn’t begin to describe. I thought they were just dreams, of course, but —“ he swallowed, shifting his weight slightly. “I have a friend who is a Seer. She saw him, too, and you — and your world, flooded and desolate. A darkness seeping into the very core and leaching through the fabric of time into Prythian. Her visions can be…overwhelming, and she was beside herself for weeks before I understood what she was saying. He came to me that night.” Azriel turned his face back to the trellis, gaze hardening. 



“He actually came to Prythian? How?”



“It seems someone might have left the door cracked,” Azriel said dryly. A fresh wave of shame rolled through her. Another mess she had created. How many more were going to rear their ugly heads today? He swallowed again, finally turning back to Bryce. “It’s too much to explain, and truthfully I don’t understand most of it. He gave me a warning, and then he led me to a spot in the mists around the Prison that brought me here. To you.”



“A warning? What did he say?”



“Something along the lines of, ‘*Don’t fall victim to my brothers’ treachery. They can’t be trusted. Shield Bryce Quinlan from the coming storm. Unite your people and set them free.’”*

  


Bryce scoffed, stomach feeling hollow. “Unite the people of Midgard? Good luck with that.”



Azriel resumed his usual silence. Bryce was utterly spent, running on fumes that were quickly sputtering out. She didn’t even know where to begin. Nothing Azriel said made any sense, and she had the profound urge to find a nearby ditch to lie in for the rest of her miserable life. 



She was really fucking tired of being included in other people’s prophecies.



“Does anyone know you’re here?” she asked after a long pause, every question feeling like the wrong one to pick first.



He was quiet for a moment, as if deciding how much he could safely divulge. Bryce crossed her arms impatiently.



“Nesta,” he admitted. 



“Only Nesta?” Bryce was surprised. During her brief stay in their world, Bryce had gathered two things: magic is fucking crazy, and everyone in Prythian was obsessed with pleasing the one they called Rhysand. She couldn’t for the life of her understand why — he seemed arrogant, self-aggrandizing, and domineering. Like his people couldn’t breathe without asking his permission first. She was filled with disgust when she remembered how very up his ass everyone had been — everyone except for Nesta.



*Oh.*



“You didn’t want your precious High Lord to know?” she preened, unable to keep the distaste from her voice. 



“No.”



“So why tell Nesta?”



“She cornered me — with your sword, might I add, so thanks for that — and demanded to know what was wrong with me. She threatened to bring Rhys here with the Harp and let him ask you himself if I didn’t tell her.”



“Me? Why did she think it had anything to do with me?” Bryce asked, nose crinkling at the thought of being the subject of conversation on another planet.



“Because it did — and because she’s *Nesta*. She always knows.” 



Bryce smiled at that, remembering Nesta’s ruthless, silver-flamed stare. She was fierce, far too uptight, and beyond rude — naturally, Bryce took to her almost immediately. At least, almost immediately after she tried to feed her to a gigantic  Wyrm. Her heart ached for the friendship that could have been. 



Danika’s face flashed through her mind. And Lehabah’s. Bryce smiled to herself, imagining the fire sprite meeting Azriel. She would have worshipped him, maybe even more than Hunt.



“I still don’t understand why you’re here in Midgard. What are we supposed to do? And what about Aidas’ brothers?”



“I suppose it’s our job to figure that out.”



Bryce chewed on her lip, every instinct inside of her screaming to walk away from whatever mess Azriel was dragging her into — but a nagging question lingered.



“Why did you come?” she asked softly, looking down at the ground.



“I told you, Aidas — ”



“I heard you,” Bryce cut him off sharply. “But why did you follow him? Why come here?”



Azriel didn’t skip a beat. “Because you needed me.” 



Bryce snorted. The only thing she needed was a long nap, and maybe another bottle of whiskey. Or three. Her head was starting to spin like it had the night before, and she took several deep breaths. She tried shaking it a few times to clear the thoughts, but they wouldn’t budge.

She needed to deal with one problem at a time.



“As fascinating as all of this is, I have another pressing matter to handle.” She stood, stretching her neck and summoning the energy for her next fight. She had a feeling it wouldn’t be quite as pleasant as this one.



Azriel looked at Bryce curiously, waiting for her to go on. If he was annoyed at her sudden change in topic, he didn’t show it.



“The Ocean Queen is fucking extorting me.”



\*\*\*\*\*



Bryce rapped on the front door of the first mortal Council member, a squat older woman with coily brown hair and ruddy, freckled cheeks. She had led the evacuation that saved four blocks of families from perishing in the fires that broke out after the missiles. 



Bryce flashed her best attempt at a genuine smile and threw her arms around the woman’s neck. “It’s so good to see you, Brianne.” 



“The pleasure is all mine, Ms. Quinlan.” The mortals had taken quite a liking to Bryce in the months after the rebellion. Not just for killing the Asteri, but for trying to include them in building the next chapter of Midgard.



Every time she was confronted with this newfound adoration, she felt a stab to the heart as guilt tore through her. She felt like a horrible, deceptive fraud who had somehow convinced them to see her as something other than what she truly was.



She was nobody’s hero.



“What brings you to this side of town?” Brianne asked as she poured hot tea in floral ceramic mugs. She had laid out fresh lemon cake with a blueberry filling, which Bryce was eagerly devouring. She wasn’t exactly hungry, but she knew food would hasten her recovery from last night. She took a sip of tea, clearing the crumbs from her teeth and giving herself a moment to respond.



“You’re not going to like it,” she warned gently. 



Brianne let out a short, boisterous laugh. “Wouldn’t expect anything less, dear.”



Bryce felt a sudden wave of panic. Brianne had grown to mean a great deal to her over the past year, finding ways to remind her of both Ember and Randall at every turn. She was no more than mortal, barely two coins to rub together, yet she bravely led as many people as she could to safety while the sky around her turned into an apocalyptic Hel. What kind of pain had forged such resilience?



She had thought of a million ways to sugarcoat this, to make it sound more appealing to the mortals, but as she stared into Brianne’s chocolate brown eyes, Bryce knew she owed her honestly above all. If nothing else, she could offer her transparency.



“The Ocean Queen wants the generators. We have to let her take them, or else she’ll flood the whole planet after going on an evil tirade and making all our lives miserable.” Bryce turned her face to look out the window beside her, unable to watch as Brianne processed what she said.



“No,” she said quietly. Firmly.



“We don’t have a choice. What good are electricity generators to a bunch of mortals on a planet that’s under water? I promise I’ll find a way to fix it later, but for now, we have to vote yes.”



*Or else my existence will be an even bigger waste of energy than it already has been.* 



“Do the others know?” 



“You’re my first stop, but they will tonight. I *need* this vote to pass.”



A warm hand reached across the table to squeeze Bryce’s, reluctantly forcing her attention back to the matronly woman before her. There was no anger or malice looking back at Bryce. Only pity.



Bryce wished she could evaporate on the spot. 



“Okay.” Brianne’s face was set in its usual steely resolve. Bryce knew how much this probably pained her, and she added it to the long list of reasons to hate herself. She’d have to start writing them down, or she’d never remember them all.



After an uncomfortably warm goodbye, Bryce hurried back down the few steps to the street. She slammed into a wall of shadow, rubbing her already aching head.



“Is this a joke?” she asked in annoyance, and the shadows skittered away at once. Where they parted, Azriel stood like a wolf in the night, silent and lethal, blending into his surroundings unsettlingly well. 



“How’d it go?” he asked in his velvet voice. 



“Do you really not know? What kind of spy are you?” Bryce clipped, already walking down the sidewalk towards her next betrayal. 



Azriel’s silence was confirmation enough that he’d heard her conversation with Brianne, and Bryce continued on without another word. She reached her next destination too soon, and Azriel automatically resumed his guard across the street. He nodded at her once before she knocked again.



This conversation went much like the first. Terrence was only a few years older than Bryce, and similarly unqualified for the responsibilities that had been thrust upon him from the rebellion. He was a teacher. After the brimstone missiles blew the mortal school into bits, he’d begun inviting students to his home to continue their schooling. 



He didn’t even try to fight back, too eager to follow Bryce’s lead. She excused herself as quickly as possible, turning to throw up into the potted hydrangeas dotting the stoop as soon as she was out of his sight.



Shadows were immediately behind her, pulling back her hair as she retched until there was nothing left. The heaves continued, and tears streamed down her face as she struggled to catch her breath. She sank to the ground. Azriel watched silently, and she was grateful for the space. She forced air into her lungs, hanging her head between her knees as the shadows hovered nearby. 



“What can I do?” he asked softly, his voice strained as if in pain.



“Have my next conversation for me,” she joked. Sort of.



“Who’s next?” Azriel asked, ever the warrior ready to step into battle.



“My father.”



“Randall?” His voice was annoyingly enthusiastic.



Bryce had almost forgotten they’d met, and she glared up at Azriel from her pathetic spot on the sidewalk. 



“You’ve been angry with me for a year, but you’re excited to see my father?”she asked incredulously. 



“He’s not half as insufferable as you,” Azriel quipped. 



“Fair point.” Bryce gulped, regretting her next words as they came out of her mouth — but she had no choice, hangover from Hel or not. “I need you to fly us there.”



Azriel flew so gently, Bryce felt like she was floating. They were much closer to the ground, and the daylight allowed her to take in the rolling landscape beneath her, stretching all the way to the coast. Her pulse thrummed as her eyes flicked between the defenseless mortals and the rolling sea, a foreboding chill spread over her as she saw how little stood in the way between them.



They were at Bryce’s childhood home in a few short minutes, floating down to the ground as if on a cloud. 



“Should I wait outside?” Azriel asked seriously. 



“Are you kidding? I will kill you if you leave me alone with them right now — and they’ll kill me for what I’m about to ask if there are no witnesses, so all your space traveling will have been for nothing.” 



Azriel lifted a hand and swept it through his cropped hair. It had a slight curl to it from the humidity in the air, making him look boyish somehow. His lashes were enviably thick and dark, the angular set of his cheekbones perfectly symmetrical. He was irrationally beautiful, and Bryce rolled her eyes.



She knew firsthand that the prettiest faces were always the most devastating. 



\*\*\*\*



“You can’t be serious,” Randall said gruffly, disappointment coloring his face and breaking away another piece of Bryce’s brittle soul. She wasn’t convinced there was anything left at this point.



“Please, dad. I need you.”



“I know there’s something you’re not telling us,” Ember spat across the table, staring daggers Bryce. 



She ignored Azriel completely. This was between her and her daughter. 



Bryce’s fury had reached a breaking point, the dam within her bursting. Still she stayed quiet, letting her parents get their arguments out of their system. 



“Why would you ever support this? This isn’t you.”



“How could you possibly think this is a good idea?”



“What will the mortals say?”



“The Ocean Queen will kill Ruhn’s mate if I don’t make this happen!” she exclaimed loudly.



Silence hung between them.



“What makes you say that?” Randall asked warily. 



“I made a deal with her,” Bryce started, and both her parents interrupted her with a new stream of protests about how she should know better. “Listen, all the lectures in the world won’t fix the situation we’re in now, so will you please let me talk?”



Ember’s eyes were blazing with a fire Bryce was all too familiar with — the same fire that kept her forever running towards trouble. Randall looked at her patiently. Waiting.



“I made a deal with her to save Lidia. She’d abandoned her service, and the Ocean Queen was going to kill her. Probably Ruhn and her kids, too. I had to do *something*, and she made me a deal. I promised I would fix one Council vote of her choosing if she let Lidia go. We have to let her take the generators.”



“She’ll leave the mortals to rot,” Ember spat, fury roiling off her. 



“I won’t let that happen,” Bryce promised. Finally, her mother turned to Azriel.



“Well, what do you think?” she demanded.



“It’s not my business,” Azriel said, shoulders tensing. 



“Then why are you here? I’m asking your opinion,” Ember reprimanded. “Tell us what you would do.”



Azriel was quiet for a moment, considering. “Well, I don’t have much information to go on, but my instincts say negotiating with monsters just proves you can be bent to their will for the right price.” Bryce’s eyes flashed to him, pleading, but he kept his gaze locked on Ember as he continued. “However, Bryce always has a few tricks up her sleeve. If she says this is the only way, I believe her.”



Bryce’s chest warmed, her cheeks flushing. She didn’t deserve his faith, and it made her feel slimy inside, even as part of her reveled in it. 



Ember got up from the table and stalked to the kitchen, clearly hoping for an ally more than the truth. Randall, however, was nodding slowly.



“I trust you, Bryce. Promise me you’ll fix it, and you have my vote.”



\*\*\*\*\*



Hunt Athalar was waiting on the steps to Bryce’s apartment building when they returned.



The sun was just beginning to set, brilliant scarlet streaks lining the few clouds hanging above the horizon. Bryce swore in her head at every god she could name, adding a few that she made up for good measure.



“Bryce,” he started sweetly again. “I’m sorry about earlier. I was just worried about you, and I shouldn’t have freaked out like that. Can we talk?” He put his hands in his pockets.



Bryce contemplated throwing herself into traffic, and Azriel’s shadows gently pushed upon her back, forcing her a step forward. 



She sighed and turned back towards him. “Could you give us a few minutes? You can wait upstairs.”Azriel smirked slightly, then dipped his head and walked up the stairs past Hunt. 



Hunt’s body was radiating lightning, his feathered wings taut, but his face remained calm. 



“I thought we were going to talk tomorrow,” she said sharply before he could speak.



“I couldn’t wait,” he said flatly. 



“Well, you should have,” Bryce gritted, teeth clenched.



“Why won’t you talk to me? Is it because of *him?”* 



“Because I broke up with you!” she snapped, patience nonexistent and relentless headache in full force. 



“You can’t *break up with me*. I’m your husband. Your mate.” he looked incredulous, like the idea was unthinkable.



Bryce’s resolve wavered for a fraction of a second. *Could* mates break up?  



To Hel with Urd and her dumbass plans.



“It doesn’t matter. We don’t want the same things.” she said coldly.



His face fell, wings drooping as he took a step forward and raised a hand to her face. 



“All I want is you, Bryce.”



“That’s the fucking problem!” she yelled, unable to contain the storm that had been brewing inside her. “The world is falling apart around us, and all you care about is putting a baby in me and living happily ever after. Wake *up*, Hunt. This isn’t a fairy tale. This is a fucking *nightmare.* How can you go on like everything is okay?” 



“We have to build a future,” he said quietly, eyes trailed on the street below.



“What future?” she laughed dryly. “The whole world is going to shit, and the Ocean Queen is going to drown us all if we don’t kill each other first. I don’t want to hide behind a white picket fence and be your pretty little housewife. That sounds like a *prison sentence,* not a future.”



Hurt rippled through him, and Bryce couldn’t bear the sight of it for a second longer. 



“I have to go lie down, Hunt. My head is killing me and this day just keeps getting worse by the minute. I really wish you’d waited until tomorrow.”



Before he could respond, Bryce pushed past him and walked up the stairs into her apartment building. She heard the rustling of feathers as he shot into the sky, leaving a deafening silence behind her.



Azriel was in the bathroom when Bryce made it upstairs, and she was grateful for the privacy as she slipped into her bedroom and closed her door. Fresh, hot tears were streaming down her face, and she wasn’t quite sure when they’d started. 



She sank to the floor, heart churning as everything slammed into her all at once like a tidal wave. It pulled her deep under, thrashing her around violently and blocking out all the light above. Her sobs became louder, and she couldn’t hold it in any longer as she wept uncontrollably. The flood gates had burst, her thoughts a nonsensical stream looping through everything that weighed on her. *Hunt Ocean Queen dead mortals fraud generators flood Aidas all my fault Hunt Lidia Ruhn Ocean Queen dead mortals —* the words snaked through her brain and pumped through her blood, roaring above the sound of her broken sobs in her head. 



She cried until the tears ran out, silent convulsions still wracking her body as she tried to find an anchor, some glimmer of hope, in this absolute shit show. 



Nothing came to mind as her brain kept looping through the list, disasters of her own creation playing out behind her closed eyes like the worst movie she’d ever seen. She stayed there, crumpled on the middle of her bedroom floor, until the painful ebbs and flows finally won, darkness washing over her and plunging her in deep.



\*\*\*\*\*



Bryce woke in her bed with a start, golden morning sun filtering in through her open curtains.  She squinted as her eyes adjusted, taking in her surroundings. She was tucked into her comforter, wearing a big t-shirt she had no recollection of putting on, and a large glass of water lie beside her on the bedside table. She reached for it and eagerly gulped it down, small streams pouring over the sides and dribbling down her chin. Between the hangover and the crying, Bryce’s insides felt dryer than the Northern Desert.



She tried to close her eyes again, but Hunt’s broken expression from the night before appeared, and she threw a pillow over her face with a loud groan. 



Maybe if she stayed in bed all day, the world would leave her alone.



A few moments later, a gentle knock rasped at her bedroom door. *That didn’t last long*, Bryce thought wryly.



“Come in,” she called out, feeling a twinge of pity that she’d abandoned Azriel as soon as they got back to her apartment last night. She tried to imagine him relaxing on the couch, watching TV without her, and the thought almost brought a smile to her lips. Almost.



The door creaked, and the scent of sweetened coffee hit Bryce’s nose before she could register the sight of him. He was shirtless again, wearing tight-fitting sweatpants Randall had given him yesterday, and holding a steaming mug. 



“I could get used to this,” Bryce muttered as he slowly approached her and held out the cup. She pulled herself upright and grabbed it from him, taking a big gulp as her eyes gleamed over the rim at him. She sighed dramatically after she swallowed, tipping her head back and savoring the warm, rich caffeine swirling through her. 



She looked up at him again, still standing over her with a wary expression on his face, waiting for her to speak. She wordlessly patted the empty side of the bed next to her, and he obediently walked around to sit beside her. 



“Did you change my clothes last night?” she asked suddenly, a wicked smirk forming at her lips as she pictured it. He shifted uncomfortably, face flushing.



“Yes. I used my shadows to cover you, so I didn’t see anything,” he said stiffly.



“Nothing you haven’t seen before.” Bryce winked and took another sip of coffee. “Thank you,” she added a bit more earnestly, holding his gaze. His hair was ruffled from sleep, his eyelids still a bit heavy, and she still had a hard time processing how normal he looked out of his usual warrior’s armor. Beautiful as Hel, but normal. He dipped his head slightly, seeming to want Bryce to steer this conversation.



She wrapped both her hands around the warm mug to keep from fidgeting. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions,” she began, still not sure where to go with this.



“Tell me what you wish,” he said simply. Bryce stared at him for a minute, thinking back over the hazy day and a half they’d spent together. He never asked for anything. 



For some reason, that didn’t sit well with Bryce.



“What do you want to know?” she asked, shifting against her headboard to face him.



He pondered briefly, eyebrows slightly furrowed as he considered. “Who is the Ocean Queen?”



Bryce laughed darkly. “A rotten bitch who is determined to make my life a living Hel.” 



“Which involves something called a generator?” 



Bryce gulped. Electricity was a foreign concept on Prythian. “Yes — it’s basically like a big battery, but you don’t know what that is… how do I explain it? It’s like a giant machine that stores a bunch of energy and powers all of our technology. It’s sort of our version of fae light, but much more intense. Just a dozen or so can power the whole city. Remember what I told you about the Asteri stealing our magic for first light?” Azriel nodded. “Well, we ran out of first light few months after they… left. If it weren't for the mortals, I don’t know what would have happened to Midgard… it would be dark, that’s for sure. Literally. They shared their technology with us, helping connect us to their power grid with a little magical intervention to keep the lights on. I don’t understand the science behind it, so don’t ask me to explain it beyond that, but basically the mortals have these giant machines on their land that we all need, and the Ocean Queen wants to take control of them.”



“To what end?” he asked, seeming to follow her rambling without issue.



“Who knows,” Bryce said honestly. “I think she just wants to be in charge. She’s always going on about how this is her land, and we’re all invaders. She threatens to flood the planet every time she doesn’t get her way, and there’s nothing any of us could do to stop her if she tried. She doesn’t hate the mortals, but she hates everyone else enough that she doesn’t care if they’re collateral in her quest to take back what she sees as hers. Part of me doesn’t blame her — she was here first.”



Azriel simply nodded, processing. Like all that made perfect sense to him.



Bryce gulped the rest of her coffee, longing for the days when politics were well beyond her. She wasn’t cut out for this.



They rose then, Bryce pulling on a big sweater over her t-shirt and fuzzy socks over her feet. She was chilled to the bone, despite the fact that the sun was already blazing over another cloudless summer day. She cooked them some eggs and bacon while Azriel watched, refilling their coffee and cleaning up behind her. Bryce showed him how the dishwasher worked, much to his delight. 



“There has to be a way for us to imitate some of this technology with magic in Prythian,” he said in wonder. 



“I can introduce you to some of the City’s engineers. Maybe they could help,” Bryce said over the running water while he scrubbed the pan.



His eyes shone, cheeks seeming to flush. “Thank you,” he said sincerely, and Bryce felt another pang of pity. He didn’t seem like was used to anyone doing things for him. She thought back to their time in the caves, him snapping at Nesta for suggesting his mother was unkind. *“My mother is anything but awful,”* he’d spat, shutting down all conversation. How did someone with a loving mother grow to be so unaccustomed with people caring for him? 



Anger began prickling at the back of Bryce’s neck, and Rhysand’s star-flecked gaze popped in her head. Had centuries of serving his High Lord’s every whim numbed him to his own needs and desires? She barely knew the first thing about his people or how their world worked, but suddenly she felt a hatred towards them she typically reserved for the Valbaran Fae. 



“Do you like it — living in Prythian?” Bryce asked suddenly.



He paused for a moment. “It’s the only home I’ve ever known.” 



“That doesn’t mean you *like* it,” Bryce pushed. “Where’s your favorite place there?”



Azriel finished rinsing the frying pan and dried his hands before he turned back to her. “Hard to say. There are a few. Our city, Velaris, is a sanctuary, like a little slice of paradise. There’s nowhere else quite like it.” He had a dreamy look in his eye as he went on, “The mountains are beautiful but harsh. The other Courts all have their charms. Mostly, I like the views from above,” he said with a soft smile, eyes glinting. Bryce smiled back, remembering how flying seemed to invigorate him. 



They sat in silence for a bit longer before he tentatively asked, “So what’s the plan for today?”



“Well, I need ten votes for the Ocean Queen’s new law to pass. I have three mortal votes, plus mine, so that makes four… Ithan and Perry will be no problem, that’s six. House of Many Waters will give all three votes, so that means I need one more…” Bryce walked her mind through all the Council Members, trying to pick her best ally for this moment. Earth and Blood had Ithan, Perry, and a quiet young witch who was studying healing under Hypaxia. House of Many Waters had the Ocean Queen, the River Queen, and a snarky mermaid who seemed to have filled Tharion’s role as dutiful servant. Flame and Shadow was led by Hypaxia, Ariadne, and Lord Cedrian, the latter two hating the Ocean Queen almost as much as they feared her. Bryce wouldn’t put Hypaxia in that position by asking her to vote for Bryce’s interests— asking her to choose between her friends and her people. 



She swallowed. That left Sky and Breath. 

  
Bryce got the first seat as Queen of the Fae, obviously. Hunt got the second through a combination of his long history fighting rebellions and nepotism. Bryce was regretting that choice immensely in this moment, if only because it meant she’d have to see him again so soon. She still had no words to give him. No answers. 



Isaiah had the third seat, and honestly, he was the most qualified for the job. He’d been annoyingly faithful to the Asteri up until the rebellion, which also meant he had a good sense of the bureaucratic nonsense involved in governance. 



Bryce would simply not be calling Hunt, so Isaiah would have to do.



She pulled out her phone and rose to her feet, whipping her ponytail over her shoulder. “I have to make a phone call,” she said to Azriel as she strutted out of the room. 



Isaiah took a bit more convincing than the mortals, but he was still quick to relent when Bryce pressed on about the ever-impending threat of the whole city being swallowed by the sea. There weren’t a lot of strong arguments against avoiding that one. 



Bryce took a long shower, still feeing grimy even after twenty minutes of carefully scrubbing every inch of her skin. 



A year of trying to get this council to agree on something, and she was finally going to accomplish it. All to steal the one piece of leverage the mortals have had since the Asteri left. And give it to a vengeful loose cannon who wasn’t afraid to use deleterious methods on her never-ending quest for power.



Gods, how did she get here?



Bryce had felt so righteous in her battle against the Asteri. Like it was all so black and white, and she stood firmly on the right side. To save her people, to avenge Danika and the Pack, to soothe her own ever-burning fire of fury that lived deep within her, aimed at everyone who tried to put her in a box and tell her to stay in her place. The Asteri. The Archangels. The Autumn King. The Fae. She felt so *right* about fighting against that.



Now, with no clear enemy to battle, Bryce was more lost than she’d ever been. All she wanted was to help makes things better, but it seemed the only thing she was good at was blowing shit up.



Bryce and Azriel walked to the pier, fifteen scrolls held in a bag on her hip as they paid the messenger otters. Tonight at sunset, the Council would reconvene for the first time in months. Bryce just hoped all her efforts at rigging the votes would help quell the arguments. She didn’t want to fucking hear it today.



Azriel sat beside her, gazing out to the sea as the sun hit its highest peak in the sky. They sat in silence for a while, and Bryce was grateful for it. She needed the space to think. As the pieces started to untangle a bit in her brain, she felt guilt gnawing at her stomach again.



“I’m sorry,” she started, and Azriel’s gaze snapped to hers inquisitively. “You’ve been here for two days, and we’ve barely talked about our feline friend who brought you here.”



Azriel’s stony face softened slightly. “Don’t apologize. I came unannounced, and clearly it wasn’t the best time.”



“I’d argue you came right on time,” Bryce countered, shivering as she remembered the circumstances she’d been in when he’d arrived. Azriel gave a dark smile that didn’t reach his eyes, and she had a feeling he was remembering it, too. “Anyway,” she went on briskly, “As soon as all this bullshit with the Ocean Queen is settled, we’re going to summon his demon ass and demand some answers. He had some nerve to send you all the way here without any directions.”



“I’ve found these types of ordeals rarely come with instructions, unfortunately,” Azriel said as he gazed out to the sea. Bryce wondered what sort of ordeals he’d been through — what kind of stories haunted him in the shadows.



Bryce stared at him for a moment, contemplating their tenuous bond. They still had more reasons to fight than to collaborate, and there was so much left to be discussed, but she couldn’t help the blooming trust growing in her chest as she slowly chipped away at his icy exterior. 



Clearly, she was still a naive fool.

Ever get that feeling that you’re running on a hamster wheel, working hard but just not quite getting anywhere? 🤔 I get it! Life gets busy, and while we might think we’re doing enough, tech is moving faster than my coffee consumption in the morning — and trust me, that's saying something.

**Level Up Before It's Too Late ⏳: Upskill in AI & Cash In!**

So, why is now the time to hit the gas on upskilling in AI? Here are a few thoughts that might just light a fire under your... well, you know! 

1. **The Future Isn’t Waiting for You:** 
   - Remember when smartphones were just starting to become a thing? If you were quick to adopt, you probably made a ton of cash or found some cool career opportunities. 
   - AI isn't a trend; it's here to stay! Are you ready to ride the wave or be left behind?

2. **Ditch the “Hard Work = Success” Mentality:**
   - Working harder doesn’t always mean working smarter. AI tools can help us automate tasks and increase efficiency. I mean, why write that email yourself when an AI can whip it up in seconds? 
   - Imagine finishing your work hours earlier because you let AI handle the boring stuff. What would you do with all that free time? Binge-watch your favorite series? Go for a hike? 

3. **Money Talks – And It’s Saying AI Skills Are in Demand:**
   - Employers are looking for folks who can not only use but also implement AI strategies. Want to cash in? You’ve got to be ahead of the curve. 
   - Did you know that many AI-related jobs are paying higher than traditional roles? Can we say cha-ching? 💰

4. **Finding Your Niche:**
   - Whether you're into writing, marketing, or design, there’s an AI strategy that can up your game. You just have to look for it! 
   - *For instance,* if you're a content creator (like most of us here!), imagine using AI to generate fresh topic ideas or to assist in research. The possibilities are endless!

5. **Resources Are Out There:** 
   - If you’re unsure where to start, link up with quality educational programs. I recently stumbled upon [this one](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) — it’s designed to help you boost your AI knowledge, and believe me, it’s worth a look (and yes, I mean it!). 

Listen, I know it can feel overwhelming, but trust me when I say: upskilling isn’t just a trend; it’s a necessity. Think about it — wouldn’t you rather be the person who adapts quickly than the one who gets left behind, wondering what the heck just happened?

So what’s holding you back? Is it time, motivation, or maybe a fear of stepping out of your comfort zone? Remember, we’re all in this together, and the world of AI could be your playground if you let it.

Alright, enough of my motivational ramblings! What are your thoughts? Have you started upskilling yet? Any cool tools you’re using? Let’s chat!",1,1748804665.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I was a frequent drinker but I was never addicted and never had the urge to drink it outside of social settings. I don't drink coffee, like sugar much (I don't crave it nor do I enjoy a cake...) nor have ever done drugs. I think the only thing I am 'addicted' to is ...food when I'm hungry. Which most people can relate to, so I don't have any idea what any other type of addiction may be like. I know these addictions may be different from opioids and painkillers, and I've heard that it affects some people very severely. I also vaguely know about the opioid crisis and epidemics in (recent) history and about the opium war in China. 

My question is more about how it makes someone feel, the addiction associated with it and how it's different from other drugs and addictions, moreso than the historical and medical side of it. Thanks!",0,1748804656.0,NoStupidQuestions,4,0.4,False

Within Bodicote itself, the one that locals tend to mention first is The Spice Room Lounge — not a café in the usual sense, but they sometimes open for coffee and cake during the day. Worth checking if they’re doing that when you're about. Otherwise, it’s really a case of heading just beyond the village.

Banbury Road takes you right to Longford Park where Brewed Awakening is tucked in near the shops. It’s a no-fuss coffee hatch but friendly, good for takeaway and a stroll around the estate or the country park. Handy with a dog or a buggy in tow.

For a proper sit-down spot, your best bet is heading five minutes into Banbury — places like Caffè Veneto (if you want slightly Italian-leaning pastries with your flat white) or the rustic, family-run Little Amsterdam if you’re after something with pancakes or more of a brunch feel. Lock29 by the canal has a few stalls too, though it’s a bit more hustle and bustle.

Back in Bodicote, I’d also say don’t overlook the village hall café mornings — not fancy, but lovely people, strong tea, and often homemade cake. They pop up now and then, usually for charity.

I’ve found myself in a rock in a hard place. (To clarify I was not looking for anything as I move soon but the most perfect women fell into my life) I know I am young but I met a person that I love. I’ve always wondered what people meant when they said they’ve found the one or that they married their best friend. Most women I’ve talked to are so seemingly boring and have been hard to connect with personally… just not anyone I could see myself having a future with. I met this girl about 6 months ago and we talked for a month or two and everything was amazing, we just clicked and i’ve never met anyone like her. The issue is I move to florida in 2 months for college, (then it was like 6) anyways she said she really liked me but wasn’t trying to hurt herself so we kind of parted ways but sort of stayed in contact just as friends, just to sort of check up on each other because i think either of us would be there for each other if we needed. Anyways, she came back and said she missed me about a month ago and said I was about all she could think about and life just didn’t feel right without us talking. She came back and it’s like we didn’t even skip a beat, I was a bit cautious for a few days for obvious reasons as i wasn’t trying to be messed with. But it was like we never stopped talking, we went out and grabbed coffee and watched the sunrise on the lake and we talked for hours and it was the most natural conversation i’ve ever had. She’s met my parents and they absolutely adore her and when she was over for a cook out, all of our close friends were around and loved her. She is everything i’ve ever looked for in a person and checked boxes I didn’t even know I had. I truly love this girl. She’s well established and owns her own business and we are at different places but I’m well driven, graduated high school with an AA and certs in comp sci and cyber security. I also held down a near full time job during all that time and have truly laid out a path for my own success. She is proud of me for doing my best to achieve my goals and loves that I am moving across the country to further my aspirations and dreams and wants to be a part of that but she’s talked about it being a little hard to do without like a ring. We talked and both agreed that it’d be too soon to get married as we both want to have a decent sized beautiful, fun celebration for both families. I am seriously considering proposing to this woman either before I leave or when I’m back for winter break after a few months of unfortunate distance. I’d really appreciate some input on this situation.

I (15ftm) live at home with my family, I won't specify who else because I feel like it doesn't matter. My dad (51m) and I don't have the best relationship, and we never have. I've never been close to him and for reasons I won't disclose. Basically, he's just not the best person, to put it lightly. Anyways. I collect items, and one thing I collect is mugs. Mostly dad/grandparent related. I do the same with shirts. I just really like ironic shirts that are usually for parents/grandparents (""you don't scare me, i have 3 granddaughters"" or ""my kids are better than yours"", stuff like that) since I'm very clearly not a parent of any kind. I have 2 dad mugs right now. I usually just use them every once in a while, but I still use them, it's not like they're collecting dust in the cabinet. For around the past year now, my dad has been taking my dad mugs and using them. Normally I wouldn't care if someone was using my stuff as long as they follow the carnal rule of ""put it back in the same (or better) condition it was before"". My dad strictly does not follow this rule, as I've learned. I don't even know if he washes his mugs. I'll grab one of my dumb dad mugs from the cabinet and it'll have coffee stains on the entirety of the mug on the inside. Plus, I don't want to use a mug that might have my dad's spit/coffee on it. I've tried talking to my mom about this situation (as she's my BFF and I talk to her about everything) but she just said that I should get him his own dad mug so he wouldn't use mine. I feel like if the situation was reversed and I was using my dad's stuff without asking and returning them gross/unwashed, I would've had my ass handed to me by now. I feel like he'd pull the whole ""my house, my rules"" thing if I tried talking to him about it. Plus, I don't have any money of my own to buy him his own mug. I really want to tell him to stop taking my mugs and leaving them gross, but I feel like it'll just end up in another screaming match. I just want something of my own.

  
Does anyone have any tips on this situation? Would I be the asshole if I told my dad to stop using my dad-themed mugs? He knows they aren't his, since he knows I wouldn't have bought anything ""best dad"" related for him, and the others would've told him. I also don't want to cause any more of a rift in our relationship. Thank you so much, guys! :D",1,1748804473.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

This is just my story so far. I am 24 years old.

-


Around the 30th of April I had uni submissions and the week before that I was really stressing myself out, I study architecture, I was staying up every night, barely eating, and if I ate anything I’d eat something 7 hours later at 2am or make even more coffee, I was practically overdosing on that.

On one of the nights before, I just drank like 5 cups of coffee, and only ate breakfast and again at 2am, 1 hour later that night, all was calm, until I had one random wave that washed over my body, a wave that surges through my brain first making me feel as if I was collapsing, and then my heart starting to palpitate, I felt like I was on the verge of collapse, everything in my vision was shaky. I had to stop that night.

The next couple of days after that, it was so much worse, every time I are I felt internal pain almost like it was making me faint, I felt like I was truly going to just die. My heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest, my pulse was at 120, my feet and hands were tingling so hard I thought that my blood was boiling. A few hours later we called the ER. 

At the ER, I did bloods, chest x ray, urine test, EKG, and all came out fine but I was told that I was a bit dehydrated and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder. 

After that I knew I had to see things through and because my overall blood pressure wouldn’t go downand it felt like I was always elevated. On top of that I’d always feel faint or internal pain while eating.

I decided to see a cardiologist first. Did bloods and 24h holter EKG, all came out fine except my ferritin was at 443, my ALT 121 and my GGT 53, Vitamin D 6 being severely deficient, overall he said I might have deranged liver function and to follow up with an abdominal ultra sound.

So this is where my journey of over thinking about my health began, and becoming even more anxious about what could happen to me, I’d google symptoms , I’d ask chatgpt about them and then which supplements I should take, I’d research into other peoples blood tests and compare mine, it’s like I was trying to already find out or convince myself that I have some sort of rare cancer or a disease that would be beyond healing. 

I started to not be able to sleep properly anymore a week after that, I’d wake up feeling like there’s a surge in my chest, feeling a constant need to put a hand there as if to check for my heart rate, my body would shake so much and my hands would be really clammy, my thighs and legs especially wouldn’t stop shaking, it would feel as if I had some horrible fever with no end. 

This carried on for a week, I would feel very fatigued every day and I’d always blame it on the potential cause of what might be happening to me, I started to just feel hopeless, and more anxious about what could happen to me, I even accepted that maybe I’ve got cancer or something. 

I saw a psychiatrist who then prescribed me propranolol 20mg 3 times a day, and diazepam 5mg to take as needed. The first weekend taking propranolol was godly, I felt amazing, almost like I could eat without feeling weird, or that I could finally just breathe and feel normal again.

But the Sunday night, it was horrible, I was shaking and I felt like I couldn’t sleep, my blood pressure systolic and diastolic were elevated again except my heart rate this time keeping stable. So I took 5mg diazepam to calm down and I managed to fall asleep.

The next day, the tremors were horrible, my body felt the same as it did a few days before I started propranolol, so we called the ER, EKG comes out fine, blood sugar fine, I manage to go for a walk after I send the paramedics away and even though I could still feel like my blood pressure was kind of elevated it felt more manageable after talking to them. That night I took more diazepam because I couldn’t fall asleep. 

The next day I felt better but I was having major body tremors in the evening. Wednesday and Thursday felt good. I also had my first therapy session on Thursday and I felt so good that day, didn’t take any medication, I felt like it was a good step and I managed to start feeling more normal. 

Until the following Friday and Saturday, where all my symptoms came back, Saturday (yesterday) I called the ER, and once again this time I went there, did bloods and EKG, and they keep relating it to anxiety disorder, he gave me lorazepam and I just went home.

And today, I was feeing really good when I woke up, idk why but it felt like I wasn’t dying and that I could just keep going but now as I’m writing this I could feel my symptoms coming back, and all I keep thinking is about what is fucking wrong with me or if I’m going to die, or how sad that I’m this abnormal I have to keep calling the ER to reassure myself of my health. Idk what to do. I feel like I can’t do normal things anymore either. All I want is to be how I used to be. But I just feel scared or as if my body will feel the same every day now. I keep thinking that I won’t survive until my ultra sound next Wednesday, I keep thinking that I’m just going to collapse. I feel really shitty and idk what to do.

The building was completed in 2021, so it’s super clean and modern. It's a **10 min drive to downtown/UW** and never had an issue commuting to work or visiting friends downtown. It’s in a great area with a younger professional crowd (lots of Epic/UW folks). Swan Creek Park is nearby with tennis/basketball courts and scenic trails along with The Rusty Bee, a neighborhood bar/lounge which is across the street too.

**Feel free to message me if you're interested, or have any additional questions!** I’m also selling furniture (TV, TV stand, rug, coffee table, mattress + frame, side table, lamps) and am happy to leave it all in the unit for you if we work something out!

(This post is a reply to the post asking about experience with machines made in China/Taiwan [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kzse9l/anyone_has_experience_with_chinataiwan_new_coffee/).)

The machine I have is from Wuxi SWF Intelligent Technology, LTD. You can find them on Alibaba, and that's how I bought it. I also looked at Gemilai,  and at least a couple of their machines looked good as well. This one caught my eye because it met all my requirements below in addition to my liking the aesthetics of it.

I've had it since August 2024 and have been meaning to write up a review of it on here, I just never really got around to it. I know a lot of people on here have a knee-jerk reaction to things made in China as being inferior to something made in the US or Europe, and while I may have agreed with them even 10 years ago, I don't find that nearly as universally true today. This thing is incredibly well made, especially on the inside. It took \~4 months from ordering to getting it. I had ordered right after a cycle of the factory making a bunch of them and sending them out. 2 months to make it, to months to ship it. I paid \~$1850 for it, and it was (I think) \~$225 to ship it.

Requirements:

\- Plumbed in/out. So that meant rotary pump.

\- Dual boilers with PID temperature control, made of stainless, not copper (just for corrosion concerns if the water didn't have some minimum TDS or if I wanted to use a more aggressive descaling cleaner.).

\- All hot water lines (except for drain) in hardline.

\- I also wanted the design to be pretty 'sparse' inside as I eventually wanted to tinker with the machine and add another 'slayer like' variable flow water path to the coffee boiler.

\- Volumetric controls in addition to manual controls.

I know a lot of people might look at this and think it's something of a GS3 or Slayer 'knockoff' and to that I would say that there's tons of knockoffs in this space amongst even the US/European suppliers. Every E61 design is to some degree a knockoff of the Faema design and I would also argue that a lot of the elements of a Slayer are a knockoff of the GS3 (especially the boiler design). Additionally, no one seems to chide the DF64 anymore for being a knockoff of the Lagom even though it shares a ton of similar elements. Anyway, not to digress too much... back to the review.

The good:

It meets all my requirements above. It's seriously a tank of a machine. It probably weighs close to 80 lbs. The boilers are stainless steel. All the hot water lines are copper and the compression fittings are even stainless, not brass (which I like because all brass has some lead in it). The motor is a Chinese branded induction motor that seems fine and the pump is an imported Procon (I believe). All the solenoid valves are imported (as in, not Chinese) Parker valves. I'm not saying they're better because they're imported, I'm just thinking that down the road should I need a replacement, it will be easier than getting it from China. The machine is a 240 V design, which I'm listing as a 'good' point in that it heats up super fast. You can pull a shot in under 15 minutes and I'm attributing some of that to the 240 V design. It draws close to 15-20 A when cold, and according to my Sense app, it draws \~600 W on average. Probably more power than a nice small system like a linea micra/mini, but it's cheap enough that it's not really a concern. I went a little overboard with the wiring for it; I have a homekit switch that I use to energize a 2 pole contactor that puts power to the plug for the machine. That way I both have a way to turn the machine on automatically, and when the homekit switch is off, it's really off in that only ground is connected to the machine rather than just switching one of the 240 V hot lines.

  
The bad:

Any repairs are DIY. The company has been great with any problems I've had, but there have been a few replacements that have been needed. The pressure gauge for the steam boiler failed and leaked (easy replacement and fix), The temperature sensor (NTC resistor type) on the steam boiler also failed, and was again, a simple fix. The company was quick to send out replacements as needed but you do kind of need to know a bit about how these machines work to be able to fix it yourself. The fit and finish is actually pretty good. One thing that irked me a bit was when I got it, it was evident that they polished all the stainless steel panels AFTER they assembled everything and I needed to spend a bit of time cleaning the green buffing compound out some crevices. I didn't really care about this because originally I had wanted to build a machine from scratch, but when adding up the cost of all the materials needed, it was coming in way over what a commercial machine would have cost me that met my requirements. I don't love that the control board is mounted pretty high and unshielded from heat in the unit. That will likely be a point of failure at some time in the future, but I do intend to replace the control circuit with something custom when I get around to it and I'll just mount it in a metal box bolted to the back of the machine.

Summary:

In all, I'm very happy with it. I like that the design is sort of a mesh of the GS3 as far as the boiler design, but that the steam and water controls are levers like a Slayer (this company also makes a machine that as far as aesthetics go, looks pretty much just like a Slayer... I don't want to debate the ethics of that, just though it worth a mention). The drip tray is nice and spacious and leaves a nice distance to the portafilter - in that it's not too far but not cramped either. I can put any mug or travel mug under there comfortably but it's not so far of a drop that you get splashing with a smaller cup for shots. It came with nice enough portafilter handles but the ones in the picture are the bottomless ones from Mischief Workshop (they're very nice). The steam nozzle is kind of a monster and took some getting used to. It came with 4 holes (and no options) that are pretty big. It was a challenge at first to steam an amount of milk for my drink of choice which would be somewhere between a cortado and flat white. The switch on the grouphead is just that, a switch. It's not a variable pressure system. All the way to the left is off, middle is preinfuse with line pressure, and all the way to the right is on. You're limited to a steam boiler temp that gives you a pressure of \~1.2 bar, but honestly, it's not needed. I have it set at a temperature that gives 1 bar and due to the size of the steam wand holes, it's way more than enough to steam a flat white amount of milk in like 10 or 12 seconds. It has volumetric controls and 5 presets for it. It's actually using a Gicar flowmeter and not just time. The temperature has single-digit precision and while you can change it between F and C, it's just converting the single digit C temp to the closest F temp. I've not really found temperature to be a very important variable in extraction. I have it set to 93 C, and there's definitely an offset if I use a thermocouple to measure the water coming out into a styrofoam cup of maybe 2 C. It came with 3 extra silicone grouphead gaskets, and the diffuser screen seems to be of the E61 type in that there's no screw to hold it on. It's pressed onto the output. I need to measure it to see if it's a standard E61 diameter.

I would recommend this machine or one like it from another manufacturer like Gemilai with some caveats; The machine will not be perfect in terms of fit and finish, but for me it's very much good enough. I think it looks great and you really need to get up close to see any flaws. It is meant for a commercial setting so it has no water tank, you need to plumb it in. I have it plumbed to a remineralized RO undersink system which I already had installed. You're also going to need to be a bit handy to have it and will likely need to wire a 240 V outlet for it too (almost everywhere in Europe and Asia use 240 V). I'd say if you like to tinker with things, it's kind of hard to beat. I'm pretty confident in my abilities as far as electronics and machines and whatnot, but I'd still cringe a bit to significantly tinker with the innerworkings of something much more expensive like a Micra or a GS3.",2,1748804159.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Here’s what I’d tell someone who’s just moved in:

# 🥐 For a Reliable Local Stop: The Milk Shed (Weston-on-the-Green)

Website: [https://themilkshedstore.co.uk](https://themilkshedstore.co.uk/)

Technically not Ambrosden, but only a 5–10 minute drive. It’s one of those places where everything’s done properly — great coffee, *really* good ice cream if you’ve got kids in tow, and the food is better than it needs to be. Can get busy at the weekend, but midweek it’s peaceful.

# 🧁 For a Quiet Catch-Up: Coles Books Café (Bicester)

Website: [https://www.coles-books.co.uk](https://www.coles-books.co.uk/)

Inside a proper independent bookshop, just off Sheep Street in Bicester. Good coffee, calm setting, and not full of noise. You’ll find local people meeting over cake and tea — no blaring music or laptops everywhere. It’s simple and it works.

# 🥪 For a Quick Bite: Pret or Caffè Nero (Bicester Village or Town Centre)

Not very exciting, but useful if you’re in town already and need something familiar. Caffè Nero in Bicester is more relaxed than Costa, and usually easier to get a seat. Bicester Village has its own setup if you don’t mind the price hike.

If you’re after something more rural, it’s often worth heading toward Weston, Launton or Stratton Audley — a few pubs and tearooms pop up that way, depending on the day. And if all else fails: take a Thermos and walk the fields. Ambrosden’s better for that than flat whites anyway.",1,1748803949.0,Ambrosden,0,1.0,False

###Acceptance
---

**Kent House, Metropolis**

---

Jon watched as his father positioned the spatula under the bubbling pancake.

“Almost,” said Clark.

“Almost,” Jon repeated from the other side of the kitchen. He lifted an empty plate.

“Annnnnnnnd…” they said in unison. “Now!”

Clark lifted the pancake and tossed it into the air as Jon’s eyes popped wide open. He wouldn’t let this one get away. He moved the plate slightly to the left and a little to the right, just as the pancake landed softly in the center.

“Yes!” Clark and Jon both exclaimed.

In his celebration, he shook the plate, and the pancake slid off, falling to the kitchen floor just as his mother entered the room.

Lois nearly dropped her tablet when she noticed the several pancakes littered around the kitchen floor. “I’m *not* cleaning this up,” she said.

“We’ll clean,” said Clark. “It’s worth it. Jon’s two out of four.” He looked down at his son. “Want to go for three out of five?”

“Yeah!” Jon shouted.

“Before you go back to wasting food,” Lois interrupted, flipping her tablet toward Clark. It revealed a video of several people celebrating in the street. Some had noticeable scars or burn marks, too, but the increasing support for the Man of Steel was coming from everyone. Those who were going through the same thing and those who just supported the inspiration he was giving to anyone in his situation.

People were waving Superman flags and holding posters with sayings like, “I Stand With Superman,” “Superman Is Not Broken!” and “He Is Not Disfigured, He Is Superman!”

“Looks like the Superman parade is booming,” said Lois.  “Think the man himself will make an appearance later?”

“Of course,” Jon answered. “Superman wouldn’t miss that!” He looked up to his dad. “We’re going, too, right?”

“I have to run an errand,” said Clark. “But I’ll meet you guys there before you know it.”

Jon nodded in agreement.

“Clark,” Lois giggled, placing the tablet on the counter, propped up so they could still watch. She reached for some pancake batter on Clark’s face. “You’re a mess,” she said, wiping it away.

“You missed a spot,” said Clark, moving his glasses out of the way to wipe away a spot under his eye.

Jon dropped his plate to the ground, shattering into pieces on impact. His eyes widened in shock, and Clark quickly fixed his glasses.

Clark was so caught up in the moment that he forgot he had to keep his glasses on to keep the magical charm working. Jon must have caught sight of his real, scarred face.

“Are you okay?” asked Lois, dropping down to Jon’s side.

“Yeah,” he said, studying his father. “I thought I saw… something.”

Clark leaned down to Jon’s level. “It’s okay,” he said, picking up the broken plate remnants. “It was nothing.”

He looked over at Lois, and their eyes met. They hated lying to their son, but the alternative was to tell the six-year-old everything about his father. Dealing with the responsibility of knowing that Clark was an alien, let alone Superman, was more than someone his age should ever have to handle.

“Look,” said Jon, pointing to the tablet on the table. “Superman’s there!”

Sure enough, Superman was landing in the middle of the crowded parade. The camera zoomed in on his face, revealing it free of scars.

Lois and Clark shared another look.

---

**Centennial Park**

*Soon*

---

Clark had said his goodbyes quickly and left the house to head to the parade. Whoever showed up there obviously wasn’t him. But who could it be?

Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman, did masquerade as a hero recently (*[Superman #105](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/1iffjfx/superman_105_the_better_superman/)*), but he had fled into space. It’s possible he returned undetected, but would he be playing the same charade again?

Clark landed in the parade, a crowd quickly forming around him. He was bombarded with questions. Everyone was as confused as he was.

“Where is he?” Clark asked.

A man with who had burn marks similar to Clark’s but going down his neck approached. He was wearing a white  t-shirt that read, “#WeAreSuper.”

“He only stayed for a minute,” the man answered. “There was something off about him,” he continued. “Even before you showed up, I could tell he wasn’t quite what he seemed. He announced that the ‘real’ and ‘normal’ Superman was back. That didn’t seem like something you’d say.”

“Thanks,” Clark answered. “Sorry, I can’t stick around longer,” he said, addressing the rest of the crowd. “I have to find out who that man was and what he wants.”

As Clark was readying his flight back into the air, the man with the white shirt tapped him on the shoulder.

“Before you go,” he said. “I just want you to know how much you helped me. I was in a bad place, but then I saw you went through something similar, and it wasn’t so bad anymore.”

Clark nodded and offered his hand, which the man quickly accepted.

“I’m Aaron, by the way,” the man added as their handshake broke.

“Nice to meet you, Aaron,” said Clark as he flew off into the sky.

---

**Fortress of Solitude, North Pole**

*Later*

---

Clark entered the fortress and was quickly greeted by Kelex.

“*Kal-El*,” the floating robot said. “*I was just going to call you.*”

“Is it Henshaw?” Clark asked. “Did he return to Earth?”

Kelex tilted his head. “*No,*” the robot responded. “*Is he back on Earth?*”

“Maybe,” Clark answered. “It’s either him or there’s another Superman doppelganger out there.”

“*Fascinating,*” said Kelex.

“What did you want to call me about?” asked Clark.

“*Jor-El has some news for you*,” Kelex revealed before the hologram of Clark’s birth father appeared before him.

“Hello, my son,” said Jor-El.

“Father,” Clark returned. “What do you have to tell me?”

“I have calculated a way to heal the marks left from the incident with the missile.”

Clark didn’t know what to say. A tear formed in his eye as he thought about what it would mean. He could fix the damage Henshaw’s missile left on him. He wouldn’t have to hide his true face from his son anymore. This was great news.

But people had been accepting what had happened to him. He was becoming a whole new source of inspiration for those who looked different and didn’t have the means to change it. Would they feel like Superman turned his back on them?

“How?” Clark finally spoke up.

“The marks left on your face were the result of your suppressed healing by the blue kryptonite exposure,” Jor-El explained. “If we were to recreate the circumstances of the incident, but remove the kryptonite exposure immediately, your full healing powers would activate, resulting in your original appearance.”

Clark took another moment. “So you’re saying I’d have to reburn my face and let it heal better?” he asked.

“Precisely,” said Jor-El.

“*Isn’t this great?*” Kelex jumped in.

“I need to think about it,” said Clark.

Jor-El tilted his head. “I see,” he replied.

“If I were to go through with it,” Clark continued. “We have one major issue.”

“*What’s that?*” asked Kelex.

“We don’t have any more blue kryptonite,” said Clark. “Or know where to get it.”

“That does pose a complication,” Jor-El explained. “We could attempt the procedure with green kryptonite, but your body takes more time to recover from that exposure. It is highly unlikely to work as intended.”

“*There’s another problem, too,*” Kelex interjected. “*Since you mentioned the doppelganger, I’ve been monitoring possible Superman sightings.*”

“Did you find him?” asked Clark.

“*Yes,*” said Kelex. “*He’s currently in Downtown Metropolis. He prevented an out-of-control bus from crashing into oncoming traffic.*”

Clark disappeared from the fortress in a flash.

###The Other
---

**Downtown Metropolis**

---

Clark landed at the scene of the near-bus crash. There was no sign of the other ‘Superman’. He looked closely at the front of the bus, its grill pushed in where they had stopped it from crashing.

“Superman?” a police officer asked, walking up to him, her eyes darting around. “I- uh… you’re back?”

“You saw me here before?” Clark asked.

The officer lifted an eyebrow. “Yes, but…”

Clark motioned toward his face. “He didn’t have my scars,” he finished for her, getting a nod in return. “And he looked just like me?” Clark asked.

“Yes,” she replied. “I don’t understand. Was it the Eradicator or that Cyborg copy of you?”

“That’s a good question,” said Clark. “I have my suspicions, though.”

Clark scanned the bus, looking inside the engine and around the sides. The brake lines were cut.

“Whoever he is,” said Clark. “I don’t think his intentions are pure.”

The officer looked over to the bus. “You think he caused the accident on purpose?” she asked.

Clark nodded.

“That’s… appalling.” The officer looked into Clark’s eyes. “Whoever this maniac is,” she continued. “We need to stop him before he kills someone.”

“I agree,” said Clark. “We just have to find him first.”

---

**Watchtower, In Orbit**

*The Next Day*

---

Clark checked the logs on the long-range scans. There was no evidence of Henshaw returning to Earth. It didn’t mean he couldn’t be back, though. Many threats have made their way to Earth without being detected.

Whether it was Henshaw or not, someone was pretending to be Superman again and setting themselves up to make saves. They could just as well save people for real, but they went to all the trouble of endangering lives, anyway. So, it wasn’t just about being the hero. It was about getting there first.

Clark hovered his hand over his face, not quite touching the scars. He was still conflicted about the prospect of healing them. How would that affect those who looked up to him so strongly now? He shared a bond with a whole new group of people who found comfort in knowing that Superman was going through what they were. Would it be a betrayal to take it away from them?

He already felt bad about hiding the scars when he was Clark Kent, but doing so was a good way to keep his identities separate. Jon knew something was off the moment he saw him, though. Perhaps it was some latent Kryptonian power the boy was exhibiting. Or it could be the sharp, unfiltered view of a child. Either way, Jon knew it was a lie, even if he didn’t know why. And that uncertainty only made it harder on him.

Healing himself could make the boy feel better, but for how long? Jon may still hold onto his uncertainty, and it could even continue to grow the more his parents keep the truth hidden from him.

Clark heard Barry enter the Watchtower and make his way toward the workstation. Barry was also a family man, so might be able to offer some advice. But Clark wasn’t quite sure what to ask.

“Clark,” said Barry from the doorway to the control room.

“Hi, Barry,” Clark said back, standing up from the terminal chair. “How do you hide your scars?” he asked.

Barry seemed taken aback by the question, giving some advice on makeup and other cosmetic solutions. 

“Oh, I mean, the physical appearance of the scars, I can hide,” Clark corrected. He pulled out his glasses from his cape and put them on, making his scars fade entirely. “I guess I’m just more asking… Jon is starting to realize something’s off, and I don’t know what to do.”

Barry’s face lightened. “I had that with Bart for a bit when he was through his growth spurt,” he said. “He’s the smartest person his age by far, he quickly picked up there was more than meets the eye from his dad, cousin, godfather… Eventually, he found out.”

Maybe he was right. As much as Clark wanted to shield Jon from the truth, he was eventually going to find out one way or another. If Clark was going to keep his scars, chances are he wouldn’t be able to hide Jon much longer. Did that mean finding a way to heal himself was the better option?

“Tough conversations,” Barry continued. “But he was able to mature into it.”

“That’s fair,” said Clark. “I just still don’t want Jon to have to mature faster than needed. He deserves to be a kid as long as possible. Was Bart never worried about you vanishing, or the scars and stuff? Before he knew, that is. I’m just in between a rock and a hard place with Jon where he’s too young to be introduced to this stuff, but he can tell that something’s being hidden from him.”

Clark felt like he had his answer, and deep down, he knew it all along. Jon was the most important person to consider in the situation.

Barry spoked up again. “Is this about the scars or about Superman?” he asked.

Clark explained how it was both. The advice he got from Bruce and Diana both had valid points: Hiding had its merits, but wearing scars proudly also had its own.

Barry’s last question before he had to leave took Clark off guard.

“Are you allowing yourself to heal?” he had asked.

That was a good question.

---

**Metropolis City Hall**

*Days Later*

---

Mayor Sackett was giving a speech about his new revitalization project in Hob’s Bay. Lois and Clark watched from the sidelines. Clark wanted to be ready for a quick exit in case the imposter showed up. What better place to stage another fake rescue than a press conference from the mayor of Metropolis?

“Any sight of him?” Lois asked, scanning the skies herself.

“Nothing,” said Clark. “I’m not sensing any potential threats he may have set up, either.”

“Maybe this is a bust,” said Lois. “His saves have been tamer in scope so far. This could be too big for him.”

“I don’t know,” said Clark. “If he wants people to take him seriously… Make him think he’s the ‘real’ Superman… You’d think he’d go big and cause a big spectacle.”

“Well,” Lois started. “If he wants to go big, he could always-”

Clark picked up the sound of a mechanical gear winding. It was unlike anything he’d heard before. Not a clock or some kind of industrial machine. He tried to zero in on the location and found an open window nearby. There was a Gatling gun hooked up to a mechanised contraption. No one else was in the room; it appeared like the weapon was rigged to fire automatically.

“It’s happening,” said Clark, taking Lois into his arms. “Get down,” he added, before running away.

Clark ditched his street clothes as he flew toward the window, just as the gun started firing. He moved in front of the line of fire, keeping any bullets from getting past him.

The crowd below scattered at the gunfire, and a blur of red, blue, and yellow swept onto the stage. The fake Superman covered the mayor to protect him from the attack.

The attack the phony hero caused himself.

Clark fired a burst of heat vision, destroying the weapon, and then turned toward the stage. He landed next to the other Superman as the mayor was whisked away from his security team.

“Who are you?” Clark asked. “Henshaw?”

The other Superman lifted his chest in a show of strength. “No, I’m Superman,” he said. “The *real* Superman. I’m not broken, like you.”

Clark furrowed his brow. “We both know that’s not true,” he said, scanning the man with his X-ray vision. He didn’t find any cybernetic components hidden below. 

“You’re not Henshaw,” he said softly.

“No, I told you, I’m Superman,” the other responded, floating into the air. “And the more I save the day, the more people will realize it. You can’t be Superman. Not like that.”

Clark hovered up and grabbed the impostor’s arm. “You’re not going anywhere,” he said. “You have a lot to answer for. I know what you’ve been doing. These aren’t ‘saves’, they’re publicity stunts.”

The other Superman pushed Clark away and flew off.

Clark flew off after him.

###Defusion
---

**Above Metropolis**

---

“Stop following me!” the other Superman yelled, stopping in mid-flight to face Clark.

Once Clark reached him, he threw a punch, but Clark took the impact easily. Whoever they were, they weren’t even close in terms of power. Clark returned with a soft punch of his own, which sent the faker flying back.

Clark kept him in sight, firing bursts of heat vision all around him. And then followed it up with a gust of powerful wind from his freeze breath. The imposter kept trying to dodge and escape, but Clark noted something important. He never returned fire. It was likely that he couldn’t.

“Give it up,” said Clark. “You’re not getting away.”

Yells cut into Clark’s hearing. They were above Centennial Park, and crowds of people were arguing below.

“How could he be the real Superman?” one of them asked. “Superman doesn’t get hurt!”

“Superman died fighting Doomsday, don’t you remember?” another rebutted.

“Well, do *you* even read the news?” a third jumped in. “They were both there when the mayor was attacked, and only one of them actually saved him. And it wasn’t the one with those scars.”

“The one who ‘saved’ the mayor didn’t save him from anything.”

“Yeah, the real Superman was the one to actually stop the bullets.”

“How do you know? Were you there?”

“I was! I saw him take the shots!”

Clark was so distracted, he didn’t notice the other Superman had approached and let another hit fly. This one packed more of a punch than the last one. But still, Clark quickly recovered, and grabbed hold of his attacker, pulling him down to the ground.

---

**Centennial Park**

---

The two Supermans landed next to the arguing crowds, drawing attention away from their squabbles.

“Let’s settle this once and for all,” said Clark. He picked up a rock from the grass and tossed it into the air. Before it could hit the ground, he blew at it, freezing it into an icicle and then burnt it into pieces with his heat vision. “Your turn,” he said to the other one.

“I don’t have to prove myself to you,” the other responded.

Murmurs filled the crowds.

“Why wouldn’t he show he can do that, too?” one of them asked.

“See, I told you he’s a faker!” another shouted.

“*Arghhhh!*” the other Superman yelled, running toward the Man of Steel, but a swift slide to the right, and the fraud ran right past him.

“Too slow,” said Clark, flipping around to push him away before he could face him again. He shot off some light burst of heat vision, careful not to do any serious harm. The man was not as invulnerable as he pretended to be.

“Look, he is a fake!” someone shouted as the imposter’s face distorted.

Of course. A shapeshifter.

“Fine, you got me,” he finally confessed. He let his charade fade away, revealing a skinny man with pale skin, mostly bald with small patches of hair, and sunken, hollow eyes. “My name is Hannibal Bates,” he announced. “I’m the Everyman.”

“Why were you pretending to be me?” asked Clark. “What did you hope to accomplish?”

“People don’t respect you anymore,” Hannibal explained. “How could they? Look at you. I should know, I’ve grown up dealing with the same stares and judgements. People needed to know Superman is better than them. And I could do that.”

“That’s- how could you even-” Clark couldn’t quite find the words to answer the twisted reasoning.

“Superman is just as respected as he ever was,” a voice jumped in. It was Aaron, the man with the #WeAreSuper t-shirt from the parade the other day. “If anything, he’s even moreso,” he continued. “Having scars or being different in any way doesn’t make you less of a person. And who better than Superman to help spread that message?”

People in the crowds nodded in agreement. Even those who were arguing against the real deal before.

“Thank you, Aaron,” said Clark, stepping aside with him. “Let me ask you something, though. Let’s say I found a way to heal my scars…”

“You’re worried we won’t look up to you, anymore?” Aaron asked.

“Not quite,” Clark replied. “I’m worried people who are going through the same thing may lose hope.”

“That will never happen,” said Aaron. “Being able to heal isn’t a bad thing, just like learning to live with something you can’t heal isn’t a bad thing, either. All that matters is that you helped us be seen and understood. And you can still do that, even if you look like you did before.”

Clark placed a hand on Aaron’s shoulder. “Thank you,” he said. “You’ve helped me more than you’ll ever know.”

---

**Kent House**

*Night*

---

Clark walked into the kitchen to find Lois sipping a cup of coffee. “Jon’s finally asleep,” he said. “He kept asking for another book, and I didn’t want to say no.”

“So you’re going to go through with it, right?” asked Lois. “You’re going to heal yourself?”

Clark sat down in the chair next to his wife. “In a way, I’m already healed,” he said. “It took a while, but I’ve worked through the emotional scars. But I still think healing the physical scars is the best move forward.”

“That’s great,” said Lois, placing a hand over her husband’s. “What’s the next move, though?”

“We need to find more blue kryptonite,” said Clark. “And I think I know where to start.”

1l0wbpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1l0wbpp/i_hate_flights/,I HATE FLIGHTS!!!,"I just returned home after a 16 hour long flight and oh my fucking god. It was literal. Hell.

My mom kept yelling at me the entire trip, I dont know what the fuck was wrong with her literally the smallest thing pissed her off, I carried my bag, she hates the bag because 'it hasnt helped us at all"" bro its carrying our electronics, what the fuck do you want it to do? Then when I tell her I cant drink coffee before the flight, she ignores me and gets me some anyways...I was awake for 14 whole hours of the flight because of it while she slept peacefully, then she wouldnt let me leave my seat (i was at the window, she was in the middle) even though I was fucking having a panic attack because of how claustrophobic it was. 

I hate the airline we chose because 1- the seats are too small and 2- LITERAL MORONS GO ON THAT AIRLINE! WHEN I TELL YOU THE LACK OF CIVIC SENSE ON OUR FLIGHT OH MY GOD! Parents werent giving two shits about their kids crying or running around the plane, people LOUDLY reciting religious text, mistreating the airhostesses and shit like that, one girl even pushed my mom while she was walking and didnt even apologise.

And sitting on the plane was literally giving me a panic attack, ive been in a 16 hr flight about 3 times now and it was never this bad, I was hyperventilating, my legs were shivering, I had no leg room because my mom kept all our trash near my legs, and I couldnt fucking get out. This was a literal nightmare, at the end i was actually starting to cry because of how tired I was and I couldnt even get any sleep because of the coffee.

1l0w9vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1l0w9vy/the_lie_i_told_myself/,The Lie I Told Myself,"Yesterday, I thought everything was fine. I looked around at work and felt grateful. I believed I was surrounded by people who were more than coworkers. I thought they were my friends. I even thought to myself, I’m lucky. I have people. I have a solid group of close friends. I’ve had them for over ten years. I’m not alone.

And then, right in front of me, two of them made plans to try a new restaurant. Just the two of them. They knew I wanted to go. I had mentioned it before. I thought we were waiting for a day we could all go together. But they didn’t even look at me. They just planned it like I wasn’t there.

That moment broke something in me.

After that, everything started clicking into place. Every small thing I had ignored came rushing forward.

Carla showed Jane a meme and didn’t show me.
Justin invited Jane out. I wasn’t included.
I missed our jogging group twice. No one texted me. No one asked why I wasn’t there.

I’ve been part of that group for years. I’ve never missed. And when I did—nothing. Just silence.

I started thinking about other people in my life. I realized no one calls me. No one checks in just to see how I’m doing. I’m always the one reaching out. Always the one initiating. If I don’t, nothing happens.

I thought Sarah was a close friend. I introduced her as one of my good friends from high school. She corrected me. “College friends.” That stung. It felt like she was putting distance between us.

I haven’t seen Amy or Russell since my birthday—last year. The last time I saw Amy, I invited her out to coffee three months ago. We had a nice time. She never reached out again.

Even my best friend—I haven’t seen her in a year. She lives one town over. I know she’s sick, but she still sees people. She still has people visiting. I’m just not one of them.

So I shut down. I couldn’t take it. I cried all day. I couldn’t stop.

People noticed. They asked if I was okay. But how do you tell them the truth without sounding pathetic?
How do you say, “I’m heartbroken because everyone I thought cared about me clearly doesn’t?”

I didn’t say anything. What could I say?

If I mattered, I wouldn’t have to ask to be included.
If I was wanted, I’d be there already.

I’ve been so stupid.

I remembered when Christina mentioned that art place where you can make your own teacup. She asked if anyone wanted to go. I lit up. I said I was free. I was excited.

But then Jane said she couldn’t go that day—and Christina immediately said, “Oh, I guess I’ll go alone.”

Like I hadn’t said anything. Like I didn’t count.

They hang out. They go out to bars. They do crafts together. They make resin things. They have game nights. I hear about it afterward, or I hear it by accident. I’m not included.

The only time I went to something was because I overheard them planning it, and I said I was free. They didn’t ask me. I inserted myself. I didn’t realize it then, but I do now.

They didn’t want me there.

And I can’t stop thinking about that TikTok:
If you’re not invited, you’re not wanted. If they invite you later, it’s a pity invite. Find people who want you.

I missed two monthly events I’ve gone to for over two years. Every month, I show up. I missed two in a row.

No one noticed.
No one asked where I was.
No one cared.

I feel so stupid for believing I was part of something. I feel like I’ve been chasing people who never saw me the way I saw them.

It hurts more than I can put into words. I feel invisible. I feel rejected. I feel like I never mattered to anyone as much as they mattered to me.

I honestly don’t know what to do with this. I just know I’m devastated.",1,1748802944.0,lonely,0,0.67,False

1l0w78z,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1l0w78z/just_got_fired/,Just got fired,"Im 23 years old btw. 
For a good while now my sleep has been absolutely horrible. I can’t stay asleep for the life of me and I can’t get up on time for anything. Not just school or work, even things I WANT to do. I was at my job for 2 years and I started to hate it so I didn’t care if I was late I just didn’t want to be there. However they changed management and they started to crack down, so I started getting warnings and then suspended, so I quit before they could fire me. Then I got another job and they were weirdos(favouritism, bosses over 35 sleeping with employees that aren’t even older than me, firing people for no good reason) so I quit before they got to fire me for the dumbest reason, and they fired like 4 other people right after for dumb reasons too. But I won’t lie, I was always late for that as well. But the competent manager who cared, ALSO got fired right before I left 😂

So I was searching for a job after that and it was taking some time. Mind you, I don’t have any savings anymore, I was only using some money from the government. Luckily I live with my mom and she helps me out which I’m thankful for, but I do need my own money and I want to start saving. 

She asked a friend of a friend if she could help me out and so I got a job at a grocery store. Within the first week, I missed two days. One I made an excuse because I was barely functioning from not getting sleep the night before. The next day was almost as if it was karma for lying because I had chest pain all day and couldn’t move freely, so I called in. I struggled to wake up on time the following Monday. She told me to just stay home. 
The next two shifts I took a vyvanse to make sure I wake up and get there on time. Fine. Then the Friday I didn’t take one and I was late by 10 mins. She called me today and said that it isn’t going to work out. 
I don’t blame em’. 

I’m just pissed at myself because I don’t know what to do at this point. I am SO tired all of the time. I can’t wake up before late afternoon for the life of me and if I do I’m late cause I wait until last minute so I can get extra sleep. I have no energy for anything until late in the day. 
Now I’m back jobless with no money. It’s going to be a lame summer. I can’t even pay for my meds or bus card, a coffee. 


I’ve been trying sleeping pills and none of them have worked for me so far. 
I’m on 7mg of Zopiclone right now. They make me a bit sleepy, so I can fall asleep fine with them, but they don’t keep me asleep. I feel so defeated

----------------------------------------

It is hard to lose weight sometimes. Shopping for food makes it more hard. Where do I go? What things should I buy? It is confusing. I want to show you how to shop at Publix. You find good food there for weight loss. I do this myself. Publix has many foods. Fresh ones. Protein ones. Healthy ones. I will tell you what to look for. This guide helps you make a good shopping list. You will know what to buy at Publix. This makes shopping trip good. You get food you need to lose weight. Let's learn this together.

Why Publix is a Great Place for Healthy Shopping
------------------------------------------------

This store, Publix, is a good place to buy healthy food. They sell fresh things. I see many fruits and many vegetables there. Their meat and fish section is also big. They have different types of meat and fish. You can also find milk things there. Also milk things not from cows. Many items are there for different food plans. They also have organic food now. Finding good food for losing weight at Publix is not too hard. You just need to look for the right things. It is a store with much choice for health.

Building Your Weight Loss Grocery List at Publix
------------------------------------------------

Making a list before I go to the store helps me much. I write down what food I need. This way I buy only that. I do not buy other things that are not good. I look for food that gives much good stuff for the body. Food with fiber is good. Protein food is also good. These help me feel full. I want to eat food that is not changed much. Whole food is best. I think about meals for the week. What food is needed for these meals? I write those down for Publix. This list keeps me on track for losing weight.

Fresh Produce Powerhouses for Weight Loss at Publix
---------------------------------------------------

The place with fruits and vegetables is very important when I shop. These foods have few calories. They have much fiber. Fiber helps me feel full. Fruits and vegetables give vitamins. They give minerals too. Eating many of these helps my body. I can eat many vegetables and not get too many calories. This helps much for weight loss. I fill my cart here first. It is the best start for healthy eating from Publix.

Lean Protein Picks at Publix for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------

Protein is a must for losing weight. It helps my muscles grow. It helps my body work faster. It keeps me feeling not hungry for a long time. Publix has many foods with protein. I look for meat that is not fatty. Chicken breast is good. Turkey breast too. Ground meat that is very lean is okay. Fish is also very good protein. Fish like salmon has good fat. Shrimp and other seafood are also good. Publix fish section has fresh things. I also look for beans. Lentils are good. Tofu is good. These plant foods have protein and fiber.

Smart Carb Choices: Whole Grains &amp; Legumes at Publix
--------------------------------------------------------

Carbohydrates are needed by my body. But I must choose the right kind. Whole grains are better. Beans are also good. They have much fiber. They digest slow. This gives my body energy for long time. It helps me feel full too. When I buy bread or pasta, I look for words ""100% whole wheat"". Or ""whole grain"". Brown rice is a good choice. Quinoa is good. Oats, not instant kind, are very good. Whole wheat pasta is okay. Beans like kidney beans and black beans are good for carbs and protein.

Healthy Fats and Dairy/Alternatives at Publix
---------------------------------------------

My body needs some fat. Healthy fat helps my body work right. It helps my body take in vitamins. Fat also helps me feel full after I eat. But fat has many calories. So I eat only a little bit. Avocados are good fat. Nuts are good fat too. Like almonds or walnuts. Seeds are also good. Chia seeds or flax seeds. I use a little bit of oil for cooking, like olive oil. For milk things, I choose low fat or no fat. Greek yogurt has much protein. Cottage cheese is good. If I don't drink milk, Publix has almond milk. Soy milk is there. Oat milk is also an option. I check labels to see if they add much sugar.

Healthy Snacks and Drinks to Grab at Publix
-------------------------------------------

Sometimes I want a small food between meals. This is okay for losing weight. But I must pick the right food. I do not want chips or candy. Those have much sugar and bad fat. A good snack is fruit. Or cut up vegetables. I can eat them with a little hummus. A small amount of nut butter is also okay. Greek yogurt is a good snack. Cottage cheese too. A few nuts are fine, but not too many. Hard boiled eggs are good protein snacks. For drinks, I drink water most time. Unsweetened tea is okay. Coffee without sugar is also fine. I do not drink soda. Juice has much sugar too, so I avoid it.

Conclusion: Making Healthy Choices Easy at Publix
-------------------------------------------------

Shopping for healthy food at Publix is not very hard work. You can find good food there to help lose weight. You just need to know what to look for. Buy many fresh vegetables and fruits. Pick meat or fish that is not fatty. Choose whole grains instead of white bread things. Get healthy fats but only a little bit. Pick smart snacks. Drink water. This guide helps you make good choices at the store. It makes your shopping trip simpler. You put good food in your cart. This helps your body and helps you lose weight. Start putting these healthy items in your basket today. It is a good step for a healthy you.

1l0w5dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OKCStudySpots/comments/1l0w5dy/my_top_spots_in_okc/,My top Spots in OKC,"Hi everyone. I am a  student here in OKC. I've struggled over time to find good spots to study. If you're like me (with ADHD and prone to all the fun projects and things you have at home), you might be looking for other environments that are helpful for your studying. I'm listing my top study spots in OKC here, which I've found over the years. I live in the village, so I have a preference for some places because of location.

Any Starbucks literally anywhere

\- pro: consistent coffee, always a spot for you, quick service, literally what you expect from a place like this

\- Con: I'm looking for different places. Also the tables are small. Additionally, I enjoy supporting local businesses whenever possible.

Barnes and Noble 13800 N May Ave, Oklahoma City, OK 73134

\- Pro: 2 charging outlets, fairly comfy chairs (they have backs lol), good hours

\- Con: Not a ton of chargers. Again, if we can support local businesses, we definitely should.

Barnes and Noble 6100 N May Ave, Oklahoma City, OK 73112

\- Pro: fairly comfy chairs (they have backs lol), good hours

\- Cons: Only 1 charging outlet in the back corner. Again, if we can support local businesses, we definitely should.

Scooters Coffee 12300 N May Ave, Oklahoma City, OK  73120, United States

\- Pro: not many people realize this but it is a sit-down place (only at this location), great hours, good coffee, tons of outlets, close to Crunch (my happy place),

\- Con: Not many cons. One time a random guy was screaming in there that he lost a ton of money trading stocks. But you're liable for that kind of behavior anywhere you go. Again, if we can support local businesses, we definitely should.

Mocha House

\-Pro:  Comfy seats, great coffee, open late. Literally wished they were closer because I'd be here all the time. Yemeni coffee with the best snacks. Can't recommend this place enough.

\-Con: far away from me. :(

Momo Cha

\- Pro: Good boba tea, good mochi donuts, a ton of wall outlets, easy to get to.

\- Con: not great seats/tables, small seating, big groups come in occasionally.

\*\*This has been a favorite of mine recently <3

Byrd Library

\- Pro: Great place. free and open to the public.

\- Con: Not really close, I have to walk to campus half a mile to get there... just not as comfortable to get to. If on campus and close by I will definitely study here.

Public Libraries

\- Pro: Free place you don't have to buy anything. wifi available. lol just included for posterity's sake.

\- Con: Hours are okay, but not open super late. Also, don't feel uncomfortable leaving my stuff. Plus, I want to get coffee. I know others like it! Not necessarily my cup of tea

Classen Coffee Co

\- Pro: Right next to a shop that sells huge bahn mi for 5$, coffee is great, okay seating (most have seat backs), cool area

\- Con: Seating is sometimes right underneath a speaker, can be pretty busy sometimes

Dutch Bro:

\- Don't try. Not even spots here, to study (though I know y'all already know this). Also, not local. Just included it bc It was listed on all the coffee shops on maps.

All about Cha

\- Pro: great seating, good drinks, good charging spots

\- Con: Just further away from the village. The Edmond location shut down. And I am NOT driving to Yukon lol. Also, not sure if they're local or not.

Summer Moon

\- Pro: good hours, good coffee, fair seating,

\- Con: Not local, charging spots are hard to come by

\*\* There are 3 locations (2 in Edmond, 1 in OKC on May). I've been to the one in OKC and the older one in Edmond. seems to be pretty similar between the two of them.

Elemental Coffee

\- Pro: good coffee, good atmosphere for studying

\- Con: Bench seating, not a ton of chargers

Perets Desserts

\- Pro: Great food, drinks, and studying spots, great hours (open late)

\- Cons: Seating isn't as comfy. small tables, always packed it seems like, see a ton of my classmates there (which isn't good for me because I like to talk lol)

Matties Coffee Company

\- Pro: plenty of space, nice aesthetic, good number of chargers, yummy food

\- Con: Hours are not great for med students' studying habits, and chairs are all metal

Feng Cha (in Moore/South OKC)

\- Pro: Great seating, great drinks, plenty of charging space

\- Con: Far away from me.

\*\*Haven't tried the Edmond location yet, but the seats don't seem very comfy

Be Healthy Cafe (any of them)

\-Pro:  Great food, good drinks,

\- Con: It's challenging for me to make the hours. Might be better for you though!

Shartel Cafe

\- Pro: Good spot, comfy tables

\- Con: Limited seating, can be crowded, especially on the weekends,

Zero Tolerance

\- Pro: Great hours, local, good business ethics, comfy spots to study, good charging outlets

\- Cons: Hours are just a little tough for me. Think of other students/people working during regular hours, this is a good place.

Kamps

\- Pro: Huge seating selection, amazing food, great drinks. Very recommended on campus.

\- Con: a ton of dental students here (nothing against y'all but teeth are nasty...) jk that's not an actual con. Not a ton of chargers is the only thing I find it hard to study here. Also, if I see people I know, I get distracted.

Places I haven't tried yet

Domenico Coffee and Dessert

\- Haven't tried because it looks fancy. Also, my HA1c can't handle too many more desserts right now.

Krispy Kreme

\- Counters are always sticky. Never tried studying here though.

Old School

\- Hours just aren't great for studying here, so I haven't tried studying at Old School yet. Maybe next time.

Clarity Coffee

\- Just haven't had the chance to try yet

HQ coffee

\- Think there aren't seats here

Teapioca Lounge

\- Need to try. Will get back to y'all.

Chicory Coffee Shop

\- Will need to try. Hours seem a bit difficult for me, though

The Range Cafe

\- Don't know how good studying around guns would be. 1) I'd get distracted by loud things going off. 2) Not super comfy around guns. TBH, never been in before though, and maybe it'd be a great place to study!

If there is any editing, it's for adding more spots that I have thought of or clarifying spots I have been to.

ETA: not sure why I’m getting downvoted for seeking support :/

See title. Genuinely struggling to make sense of it.

This is my story: 
My ex is a pathological liar. We were together 5 years and has lied about pretty much everything. Some of his lies include:

1) Age. He told me he was younger when we first met. I found his registration records with his real age. I was naive and young and continued to date him despite this obvious red flag. 

2) Job. He first told me he worked full time as a scientist and then weekends at a coffee shop. I figured something was fishy and he “came clean” telling me it was part time at the biotech job and part time at the coffee shop. This is what he told me when I broke up with him initially. From the new gf (more on this soon), I recently learned that he was only ever at the coffee shop the whole time. His lies went so deep. he had back stories for coworkers that didn’t exist, fake meetings, fake presentations… 

3) Harvard degree. He tells everyone this lie…just not true. He even went on a podcast saying he has a job in my field and the degree I do. 

After we broke up, he got into a relationship with a girl 10 years younger and still in college. He got into this relationship within a month of me ending things.  She told me that he said he was “completely over me.” Months later, not knowing about her, I backslid and saw him. I was struggling with the break up already and was also experiencing a stressful family health situation. I regret contacting him post break up but I guess I’d never have known the full truth about him otherwise. When we reconnected he lied AGAIN about his job. He said he got a new job in a new city and showed me an offer letter as proof. The offer letter was fake… 

He cheated on this younger gf many, many times with me. He saw me the weekend after he flew to her study abroad in Spain. He texted me the whole time. I only found out about her bc she posted a tiktok of his cat. It’s doubly weird because she’s the same ethnicity as me. Before me, he’d never dated my ethnicity. 

I was 20 (now 26) when we started dating. He was 25. His ex before me was also 20. And his most recent gf is also 20, but now he’s 31. He likes them young, and he makes things move quick. 

He presents as a “nice guy,” but is the most insidious type of insecure, dishonest man. I feel horrible because everything feels like a lie. What was real? I wasted 5 years on a mountain of lies :/ ",0,1748802471.0,BreakUps,0,0.4,False

Hi there! 🤗

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy (female) and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

I’m not looking for any sexual activity and I stick to what we agree. 

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
•Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Lowkey hopeless romantic, but I won’t say it unless you ask. 😉

1l0vzus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ceramics/comments/1l0vzus/proposing_an_artist_residency_at_a_local_business/,Proposing an artist residency at a local business— any advice?,"Hello! I’m somewhere between an amateur potter and actually pretty good at it, and I’ve been wanting to figure out how I can start to spend more time making pottery without just holing up in my studio space and hoarding finished pieces to myself. 

At a coffeeshop/greenhouse sort of business in the town I’m moving to, they have a really cool collection of pots you can buy to put plants in, but so obviously— they are all factory made or mass produced. Connected to the same plant store is a coffee shop, whose theme leans heavily into plants and being present. Both stores together are doing really really well and the community raves about how amazing this idea was to put a coffee shop in a plant store. 

My idea would be to propose an artist residency— where I could be paid hourly to take on a small but visible studio space in part of the store. I would make pottery in front of the customers in the store, and have a stock of unique planters that could be purchased. In addition to making planters, I could also make unique cups and mugs for the specialty drinks at the coffee shop. Obviously, the benefit to the store would not only be making money off of handmade pottery- but also having the unique experience of watching an artist at work. I can be very friendly and social and take on a customer service role as well, perhaps helping customers pick out the best pots for the plants they are getting. 

My questions start here: 

Does this sound like something a business owner would see as valuable? If not- what could I do to make it sound valuable? 

Do I propose a business plan at the same time as bringing up the idea— or is that too much?

Do I try to get my own kiln for my own purposes and use that— or do I convince the business to get a kiln?

Is there stuff I’m not thinking of, that as you read this, YOU are thinking of? 

Any and all suggestions or thoughts are appreciated!

Not going to lie, I did not expect to be back on here. But somewhere between curiosity and hope, I figured I would give this another real shot. I am not here for entertainment. I am here to meet someone who is also tired of surface-level talk and is ready to build something solid. Not perfect. Just real. Honest. Intentional.

Starting fresh can be exhausting. All the guessing games, the breadcrumb texts, and weird energy. I am not built for that. I want the kind of connection where we both show up fully, speak our minds, and know the value of growing side by side. If that is what you are looking for, I already like your style.

**About Me**

I am 32, a veteran, a first responder, and currently working full time as a Campus Safety Officer at a middle school. What I do goes way beyond walking the halls. I am someone the kids and staff rely on. I have also worked as an EMT on an ambulance and served as a volunteer firefighter. I have trained armed security officers, and I am finishing my degree in history education online. The goal is to be a high school history teacher, and yes, I will probably end up being the football coach too. It just seems like fate at this point.

Physically, I am 5 feet 10, mixed Black and white, and yes, I am on the heavier side. But I am working on it. I walk 8 to 12 miles a day at work and I am already halfway to my goal weight. I am not looking for perfection in anyone else, so I do not expect it from myself. But I do believe in showing up better every day.

I am country at heart. Think off roading, fixing things that probably could have waited, and finding peace in the quiet. I am a bit of a Black cowboy, Yes I have a Cowboy hat! A few actually. 

I have survived North Dakotan winters and African summers. I have seen war zones and school zones. I have been overseas, worked across states, and met all kinds of people. Travel and experience taught me one thing clearly. Life is too short to pretend or perform. So I do not.

**What I am Looking For**

I am looking for a woman who knows her worth. Someone who is kind but not passive. Intelligent, open-hearted, and ready for a real partnership. You can work or stay home. Either way, I will support you. I make enough to keep us steady, and while I will not impress anyone with flashy spending, I will earn your trust through consistency, care, and effort.

Single moms, you are welcome here too. I love kids. I work with them every day. And if you are still hoping to build a family together, I am your guy. I am waiting for the right woman to raise children with, not just someone to pass the time.

I do not do yelling. I do not do passive aggression. And I definitely do not do drama. I believe in communication, honesty, and laughing through the hard days when the best we have got is frozen pizza and a deep breath.

**What I Bring to the Table**

I bring stability. Financially. Emotionally. In how I show up. I have two steady incomes and a life I have built with purpose. I am the kind of man who remembers what you say, notices when something is off, and cares enough to ask twice.

I bring peace. No raised voices. No walking on eggshells. I believe love should feel safe. I do not use anger as a weapon. I use humor, presence, and patience to get through things. And yes, I know the difference between their, they are, and there. Just thought that might earn me some extra points.

I bring resilience. I have worked long nights and hard jobs. I have responded to emergencies with lights and sirens and stood in burning buildings. I have protected people in war zones and comforted children in school hallways. I have held the hands of the dying and prayed with them in their final moments. I have looked people in the eye and helped them find peace when fear tried to take over. That kind of moment stays with you. It teaches you what matters. It humbles you. It makes you gentler, even when life has made you strong.

I bring love. Real love. The kind that folds laundry without being asked. Even if, to be fair, you probably do not want me folding laundry. It usually ends up in a ball and somehow still wrinkled. But the effort is there. The thought counts, right? I am the kind of man who learns your coffee order, texts you when I am thinking about you, and shows up even when I am tired. I believe in the kind of partnership where you know you are never doing life alone.

**The Life I Dream About**

I want a home out in the woods or tucked up in the mountains. A porch. Some horses. Kids running around. The kind of life that ends with us curled up on the couch after they go to bed. A quiet, strong, loving life. I do not need luxury. I need peace, laughter, faith, and someone who is just as ready to build that life as I am.

**Final Thoughts**

I am not perfect. But I am present. I am real. I am trying every day to be better, love deeper, and lead with both strength and gentleness. I want a woman who sees the value in that. Who wants to be cherished, not controlled. Heard, not silenced. Partnered with, not picked apart.

If any of this speaks to you, even a little, do not overthink it. Send a message. Let us see if this could be the start of something worth keeping.

And if not, I still wish you peace, love, and a man who shows up the way you deserve.

**Chapter 1 The Hot Stranger**

MONALISA 

I walked down the rainy and lonely path leading home, not caring about the rain pouring down my body and wetting me up in a way my boyfriend could never. 

My boyfriend had just broken up with me and I was heartbroken, perhaps not very much so but it did hurt me. His reasons? I never responded to his touches well enough and never melted in his arms like I should. 

He claimed I never let him touch me enough too. Just once I had let him hug me and his remark? I was stiff as a board. 

That was just a week ago and today he had broken up with me, giving me one advise... To become a nun for the rest of my life as I was too insensitive to a man's touch. 

I was mad at how much he had shamed my body. I knew that was not entirely my fault. It could not be my fault. 

I had to be attracted to some type of people but I had no idea what type of people I could be attracted to. At a point, I had thought maybe I wasn't straight but that wasn't the case. 

I was straight but I was just not physically attracted to my now ex boyfriend. 

""Forget about him!"" I muttered, almost angrily and stopped at the gates that led into my home. 

The lights were out and that was a little bit weird as I was sure that mum should be inside. Brushing it off with a guess that she went somewhere and was caught up there because of the rain, I proceeded into the house. 

My father was dead, long dead in fact. I was just 6 when he died and if it wasn't for the pictures I stare at constantly, I would probably not even recall what he still looked like. 

After my father's death, things had gone south for a few years until we suddenly moved into this huge beautiful estate. Mum said it belonged to Dad's friend who had found out about our state. 

I had never seen him, never even heard his voice but he was the owner of the estate and also the one sponsoring my education. I pushed the door open after unlocking it with my thumb print and walked into the living room. 

It was dark inside with only a small lamp turned on but almost immediately, I sensed the presence of someone in the living room. I looked towards the sofa and I was shocked to find a man sitting on the sofa. He was shirtless and the only fabric on him was the towel wrapped around his waist. As much as the first thing I wanted was to scream at this strange man in our house, I could not. 



I found myself tongue tied. His abs were visibly well built and those biceps and triceps, they made my insides churn with excitement! 



His tanned skin looked so smooth, so well taken care of and my gaze trailed slowly to his face. He had a stern look on his face but that didn't take one bit or gorgeousness away from him. 



I could see his blue eyes as he raised his head up and his eyes met with mine making my heart jump. 



That was one weird feeling. I had never felt my heart react like that to my ex boyfriend. 



""What are you doing?"" He spoke. His voice so magnetic, that it sent a shiver down  my spine like an electric current running through my body! With just this man's voice. 



It was little wonder though. His voice was deep and in all shades, masculine. It was hot!



""Get over here already, I am not so patient,"" he added in that same voice and I feel a surge of heat run all over my body again. But this time I tried to reason, who was this man? Why was he in my home? And why was he calling me over?



But strangely, I could not reason. His voice was authoritative and I could not help myself from doing just what he said. I walked over to him, my heart thumped in excitement. 



I was definitely going crazy! And out of my mind too! But this also... It also felt good.



**Chapter 2 He Is Lucius Devine?!**



MONALISA 



So it turned out I wasn't insensitive to a man's touches. I was just insensitive to my ex boyfriend's touches!



The man got up to his feet, and there he stood like a Greek god itself, in all glory. 



Suddenly we both heard the door click open and realising that could be mum, I hurriedly jumped away from him. 



""I will get back to you,"" he said to me, making obvious our height difference. 



I wasn't short. I was 5'7 but this man had to be at least 6'3 or 6'4. 



""Lisa?"" Mum called as she turned on the lights of the living room. 



""Mum,"" I replied with an awkward smile, tucking my wet hair behind my ears. 



""Lisa??"" The man called my name in surprise and turned to face me. 



""You are Lisa?"" He asked me but I remained silent. The fact that mum wasn't panicking meant that she knew this strange man. 



""Yes, Mr. Dina. This is Lisa, my daughter. I see that the both of you have met already,"" mum smiled at the man. 



I heard him curse roughly. 



""Is there anything wrong? Was she rude to you?"" Mum asked and faced me. 



""Were you rude to him?"" She asked with a scolding expression. 



""Don't scold her, she wasn't rude to me at all,"" the man replied. 



""Oh, I am glad. Lisa, meet Mr. Devine, your father's friend who has been helping us out for years,"" mum said to me and my eyes widened. 



The man I just did some indescribable things with was my father's friend!!



What. Have. I. done?!



**Chapter 3** 



MONALISA



""Lisa, greet him and show your appreciation,"" mum whispered to me, clearly irked by my attitude. 



I turned to face him squarely with a smile on my face and stretched my hand out for a handshake which he took, hue big hands covering mine made me feel small and yet... Desired. 



'Lisa! It's a handshake!' I scolded myself mentally. 



""Nice meeting you...""



""You can just call me Lucius,"" he cut me off and swears, the fact that mum was standing in the living room with us didn't change the effect this man's voice had on me. 



My gaze dropped to his lower part of body for a second, but I looked away as soon as possible, raising my head up to look at his blue, mesmerising eyes. 



""Nice meeting you then, Lucius. Thank you for your help,"" I thanked him and pulled my hand out of his immediately. 



I was crazy and I needed to be away from this man like right now! Without spending another second, I grabbed my handbag, pulled my hand away from his and sprinted out of the living room. 



""Lisa!!"" I heard mum call my name but I paid no heed to her and just sprinted to my room. 



I shut the door behind me, breathing heavily. Not just because of running but because of what had just happened. My first taste was my father's friend who had been helping us all these while. 



But why had he called me over to do that? Seeing the surprised look on his face, he had definitely mistaken me for someone else. Perhaps he had thought I was the woman he had paid for to come over? That could only be the case based on the words he had said to me. 



But why was he here? And why was my body reacting to him so much? 



These questions were however not the most urgent thing at the moment. 



I reached for my door and locked it, to ensure that I kept mum out of my room. 



My hand reached for my wet clothes and I pulled them off my body hastily along with my panties. I dumped them on the clean, tiled floor and pulled my phone out of my bag. I had to get myself to climax. I desperately had to finish. 



I got on my bed and played a video I had on my phone. I started to touch myself.



""Oh god"" I moaned. 



With my eyes shut, I could see myself in place of the girl in the video, I had also replaced the image of the man in my head, it was him, my father's friend. 



""Oh heavens! Yes, daddy!"" I cried out and that was my undoing as I came hard, my body bucking and shaking terribly. 



I had just had the best experience my 'insensitive' body had ever known and that was because of my father's friend. 



I was so done!



LUCIUS



I ran my hands through my dark hair, my jaw clenched as I thought over what I had done earlier. I was now in my own home and though only a few rooms had been cleaned up, I had to make do with it for now. 



Lisa's mum, Stella had meant for me to stay over at their own home. She had also told me that she would not be coming home that night and I would have the house to myself until tomorrow when I would have my mansion appropriately cleaned up. 



To release my jet lag and to warm up on such a cold night as this one, I had called my friend to send a woman over to me but how could I have been that silly? 



How would the woman I asked to come over be able to open the door herself?



But it definitely wasn't entirely my fault, Lisa could have simply told me who she was and nothing would have happened between us but she just did it as I ordered. 



""Gamóto!"" I cursed roughly underneath my breath. 



She clearly had no experience and that most probably was her first time but she made me felt so good.  



""Nah, Lucius."" I groaned and got up on my feet. I was thinking too far already. 



What happened tonight was a grave mistake that I had to ensure would never reoccur in the future. Lisa should be like a daughter to me and nothing more. 



It was terribly wrong to think about Lisa, a young lady who should be like a daughter to me while jerking off but I could not help it. 



Just this once. I would do it, thinking about her just this once and I will never do it again. 



It was a promise I made to myself.



**Chapter 4 My First Man**



MONALISA



""Do you understand?"" Mum asked and I nodded in affirmation. 



""Yes, mum.""



""He is our...""



""Mum, I am going to be late for lectures. You have told me over and over again. I will be nice and respectful towards him.""



""Great. You're coming home tonight?"" Mum asked me. 



""I don't really know yet...""



""Don't waste your free time roaming about with your friends. Just come back home and stay with me, okay?"" She asked. 



""Alright. I will just come back home."" I replied and leaned in, kissing her on both cheeks before pulling away and biding her bye. 



I skipped out of the house with my bag in hand. It was a new day and I was trying my very best not to think about what had happened last night. 



Mum had told me he just returned to the country yesterday and was moving into the mansion opposite ours. 



I looked at the beautiful and huge mansion that was opposite our home and nodded firmly. To own that mansion and this entire estate, that man had to be a multi billionaire. 



I kicked the thoughts of him out of my head once more and headed to school. 



...



""Leon really broke up with you?"" Francesca, my best friend asked in a whisper. 



""Yeah, let's talk about it when class is over,"" I whispered back to her. 



""How could he?"" Francesca huffed and turned her attention back to the lecturer. 



The lecture was almost done and I could see that Francesca could barely wait for that to happen. In a couple of minutes, the lecture was concluded and the lecturer left class. 



""Tell me about it, Lisa,"" Francesca immediately turned to face me and I sighed softly. 



""He said I am too..."" I looked around. 



""Maybe we should visit the coffee shop and talk about this there,"" I said, getting up on my feet. 



Francesca did the same and we both headed to the coffee shop, with Francesca ranting about how she was going to rip Leon's body apart for breaking up with me. 



We finally settled in the coffee shop, ordered two cups of coffee and got ready to talk. 



""So, Leon said I am too insensitive to a man's touches and that I should just turn into a nun already."" I shrugged and drank a bit from my coffee. 



""What the?! He thinks he is anything? He should be lucky that you agreed to dating him in the first place. He is way, way, way below your league,"" Francesca replied. 



""You know what? I have an idea,"" Francesca said as I dropped my cup of coffee on the table. 



""What idea is that?""



""You have to date someone else. Someone hotter than Leon. I bet it's his fault if you are not turned on while with him. Just find another guy who turns you on and...""



I could no longer hear what Francesca was saying as her earlier words repeated in my head. 



'Another guy who turns me on...'



I could only think of one person. The one person I should not even be thinking of. 



""Lisa? Are you even listening to me?"" She knocked on the table and I jolted back. 



""Yeah? Yes, I am. I am listening."" 



""Doesn't seem like so. Are you that heartbroken about the breakup?"" Her face turned soft and emotional. 



""Not really."" I mumbled. 



""Of course, you wouldn't be that hurt. You guys only dated for like three or four months in fact, right? But you spaced out, what were you thinking of?"" Francesca asked. 



""Nothing. Nothing at all,"" I replied, not wanting to think back at last night. 



""I can introduce you to a new guy. He is smoking hot! One of the hottest guys in college at the moment!"" She said to me. 



""Really?""



""Yes. I am sure you are going to drool at just the sight of him,"" Francesca giggled. 



""I hope so,"" I mumbled. 



""I will introduce you to him tomorrow. Get ready to lose that v card in the sweetest way possible, Lisa.""



...



""Mum, do I really have to go give him these cupcakes?"" I asked mum with a grumble, clutching onto the plate of cupcakes in my hands. I was back home and after mum's long lecture, I was about to give cupcakes to Lucius Devine.



""Yes, Lisa. We need to be as nice as possible to him for letting us stay here for this long and financing us big time. He is like a father to you, okay?"" Mum asked me and I just pressed my lips into a thin line. 



""Fine, it's just giving him these nicely and respectfully. I will do just that,"" I replied her and walked away. 



It was obvious that mum was very much grateful to Mr. Devine and yeah I was grateful too but I could not help but feel nervous and awkward, going to give cupcakes to him. 



Immediately I got to the gates of his home, I was stopped by a few men in black suit. They had never been around before and they were not the guards of the estate whom I knew pretty well. 



""I just live right there."" I said to one of them, pointing back at our place. 



""Your name, Miss?"" He requested. 



""Lisa."" I replied simply and he moved away from me to make a phone call. 



A few seconds later, he was back. 



""Please go on in,"" he said to me. 



""Thank you."" I mumbled and walked in, wondering why this man needed so many men to guard his place despite the amount of security the estate itself had already. 



I shrugged it off and stopped in front of the door. I drew in a deep breath and let it out before reaching for the door handle. The door clicked on its own and I pushed it open. He must have opened the door. 



I walked into the mansion that was simply breathtaking. He had just arrived in the country, right? So how could he furnish this place so well already. 



'He is a billionaire, Lisa!' I reminded myself and stopped in his living room. 



""You're here."" I heard his deep, attractive voice. 



Pardon me for using the word attractive but I just could not help it. It was the truth!



I looked towards the direction of the voice and saw him walking down the stairs and as if with an intention of tempting me, he was without a shirt. 



All he had on was a grey sweatpants and I tried not to look at those intricately shaped abs but I failed at trying as I stared at it so obviously and then my gaze dropped and I tried again. Believe me I tried not to look down at his body but I did anyways and I could see the outline of his bulge. 



""You are staring inappropriately, Lisa,"" he said and I quickly looked away, feeling my cheeks heating up. 



I pressed my thighs together quickly and looked the other way. 



I continued looking the other way until I felt him close to me, close enough for my nostrils to draw in the scent of his cologne. 



I swallowed hard and turned to face him. 



""Hello Mr. Devine,"" I flashed him an awkward smile. 



""My mum asked me to give these cupcakes to you. She just made them and..."" I pressed my lips into a thin line, not knowing what more to say. Standing by this man had taken the words away from me. 



""Last night was a mistake. I took you for someone else and as much as I do not know why you played along, I still want us to forget it. Like it never happened."" he said to me and I moved two steps away from him, to be able to speak better, away from all of that... Sexiness. 



""I didn't mean to play along and I am usually not like that..."" I didn't know why I felt a need to clarify. 



""Last night just happened. I wasn't in the right state of mind and I am glad things didn't go any further than it did,"" I glanced back at his lower body, unable to help it. 



""Lisa, my eyes are up here,"" he said and I quickly looked back up at his face. 



""I want to make things clear between us. You will be like a daughter to me and I will be like a father to you."" He said and immediately he said those words, I could only think of one other word...



Daddy. 



I don't know if that thought was innocent or downright wrong but my blabbering mouth let out some silly words. 



""If you are like a father to me, then I can call you daddy?"" I asked and heard him groan deeply. 



The next second, he had yanked me closer to himself, making the plate of cupcakes in my hands drop and before I could even do anything... Which I wasn't actually trying to do anything tho. 



He had bent down to my height and took my lips in his and! His lips fitted mine perfectly. 



This wasn't my first time kissing but it was my best time kissing! I had heard tales of girls getting weak in the knees while kissing but not once had I felt that but with this man who was way older than me, I felt my knees giving way. 



His lips brushed mine hard and with a tinge of possessiveness, his arm around my waist pulling me even closer into his body!



Throwing caution into the air, I moved my arms to his broad, strong shoulders and kissed him back but surely did he dominate the kiss, his tongue lashing out against mine. 



After letting out a soft moan into the kiss, I heard him let out a low, deep growl and the next second, he pulled away from the kiss and held my chin up with his right hand while his left hand remained on my back. 



""Don't never call me daddy next time,"" his hand squeezed my back and ignoring the serious look on his face, I moaned again. 



""Gamo, get out,"" he pulled away from me completely and turned away. 



But I wanted more from this man.  



I wanted him to be the first man to take me.

So, I figured I’d put myself out there in the vast Reddit universe and see if I could find some fellow humans (or highly advanced AIs, I don’t judge) who are down to build some longterm, caring, and genuine friendships.

I’m someone who deeply values connection – like, not just “hey wyd” once a week, but real convos, voice chats, random memes, deep dives into human behavior at 2am, or just chilling in silence while gaming or flying a 737 across Europe. ✈️

Here’s some of the stuff I’m into: 🪐 Honkai Star Rail – let’s talk lore, let’s talk builds, let’s talk “why is this boss ruining my life” ⚽ Football – the kind with the ball at your feet. I’ll debate anyone who thinks Neymar isn’t top 3 of our gen. 🧠 Psychology nerd – I love reading psych books and learning more about what makes us tick. If you’ve got book recs, toss them my way! 💭 Philosophy – big fan of wondering what anything even means while forgetting my coffee (more like white monster) exists 📺 Anime – I love it. Recommendations very welcome (especially while I await JJK S3 like it’s my life source) 💪 Exercise – yes, I work out, but I’m also very open to diet cheat day inspiration. Send help. And snacks. 🎮 Super hyped for GTA 6 – it’s coming. We must prepare. 🩸 Dexter – yeah, I know. I still haven’t seen it. But I want to. Badly. 🛫 Flight sim enthusiast – I fly a lot of planes virtually, mostly commercial ops. Ask me about my favorite approach. Fellow avgeeks are more than welcome.

I like to think I’m chill, funny-ish, and a good vibe to be around. Whether you want to game, chat, share life updates, spiral over anime characters, or just trade snacks and philosophy quotes - I am your person.

If you’re someone who’s also looking for a real connection, not just small talk, but that “let’s be part of each other’s lives for real” energy, then hit me up!

So have had this 'new' roommate for three months now. The first 'interview' went alright, landlord screened and approved him. Then about 2 weeks in he's leaving dirty dishes piled in both sides of the sink leaving them unwashed for days, even more than a week, on end. His food crumbs litter every countertop and surface and stay there uncleaned, again for weeks. My favorite so far was leaving a french press half-full oh his coffee so long it developed mold. I didn't even know you could have mold grow on top of coffee!

Myself and Trucker roommate did his a courtesy of a 'sit down roommate meeting' to discuss this at about two or three week mark into sharing the house. Apparently it was all a farce with messy guy's false excuses, and no promises, commitments, or plans to remind himself or keep on top of basic chores.

Cut to about May 15th, where I am hounding him via text to wash his dirty dishes again. He 'forgets' to go play a gig somewhere and I have to harass him for another day to clean up. Then almost to mock me, he leaves the washed dishes out in the kitchen again for days.

Finally on top of everything he's leaving garbage in the house and not throwing it away. Or just tossing it into the small backyard, literally three feet away from the garbage cans, and leaving it to rot in the summer heat.

We also found a bed bug at the start of May. New messy roommate moved in late April. Not accusing him, but highly suspicious. The brief glimpses of his room that I have gotten are that the floor is covered with his laundry and as messy as I'd anticipated.

So I had enough trying to be reasonable to a 30+ year old man, who allegedly owned his own carpentry business, how to do basic human chores. I started taking pictures of everything. The crumbs on the counter, the moldy coffee and dishes left abandoned for days to weeks. Didn't go into his room as that would case problems and violate his privacy, and I will at least give him that modicum of respect.

Today after paying rent for next month, the landlord got an email from me with every picture of the mess in the house that was left by messy roommate. For further context, he emailed the landlord to complain about me 'being unfair' at the start of May.

So this morning after avoiding me, I could tell he is mad as hell. but mad at ME. Because apparently it's my fault that he can't clean up after himself.

Yeah, I didn't want to snitch. But what other options did I have?

And oh yes, communication has broken down absolutely. He refuses to speak to me, avoids me, and this morning left the kitchen when I went to feed myself.

So, I don't see how I'm the asshole in this situation. Despite the messy roommate's claim that I very much am.

I am not responsible for a man-child's mess. I am not a maid, nor his mother. It is Not my responsibility to remind a man-child to stay on top of their chores and what their responsibilities are.

But I am financially responsible for this shared townhouse. All the utilities are in my name.

1l0vwkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawyertalk/comments/1l0vwkl/i_love_my_job_i_used_to_hate_it_until_i_took_the/,"I love my job. I used to hate it, until I took the advice I was given by my toxic employer.","Like so many people writing here, I was once stuck in the associate grind. I eventually landed in a shitty, but very big and prestigious, corporate law firm. Here was my issue: I'm real fucking good at what I do. So much so that I got done with everything on my docket in a timely and orderly manner every day. And what did I do when I was done with my job? I went home, because I actually care about maintaining a healthy work-life balance. My coworkers, however, did not. And it wasn't because they were bad at their jobs, it was because this firm measured productivity in the amount of hours you spent at the office. Those other guys were simply better than I was at playing that game, sitting there and pretending to work for hours on end, just because logging a certain amount of hours (60+ weekly) was expected of you. In the eyes of the partners, I was the slacker.

It didn't help that I came from the ""wrong"" kind of background. Didn't come from a lawyer family. Working class background. Never really fit in with upper class society. Just a damn good lawyer.

It didn't take long until I was pulled into an unscheduled meeting with a partner and HR, where I was told that they weren't gonna go forward with me any further. I just wasn't a ""good fit"" for the company. And the partner told me that oh-so well known condescending backhanded insult: ""Maybe you'd be better off in a government job."" Asshole.

So I took him up on that, and transitioned into a job for a government agency where I specialized myself in school law. I didn't make as much money, but I got a hell of a lot more pleasant work-life balance, I got to practice **fun** law instead of a soulless corporate grind that was only about money and nothing else, and frankly? If we're just looking at what my hourly pay was, I probably wasn't worse off than those other junior associates who were expected to spend 12+ hours per day in the office.

After some 5+ years of various kinds of government work, I felt like it was time to cash in on the dues I had paid, and I managed to land a job as the in-house legal counsel for a big private school company that runs schools all over the country I live in (not the US). It's very well paid, I get to set my own terms for my work, and I'm entrusted with everything myself instead of having to report to some empty fucking suit who couldn't lace my boots if their life depended on it. You know why? Because it's damn hard to find someone who's specialized in school law and has spent half a decade working in that field at a high level of difficulty. There ain't a whole lot of school lawyers out there, because school law isn't *sexy.* Most government work isn't sexy. But it gives you a skillset that's highly relevant in the field you've chosen to specialize in, that you'll never get by being ground up and churned out in the meat grinder that is those corporate law firms that promise you nothing but money for the price of your soul.

I once saw an interview where famous rapper Fat Joe was trying to give some advice to a younglig rapper called Tekashi 69, who was starting to get in trouble with the law, and Joe told him: *""Your time is the most important thing you have. That's why, your time is what they'll try to take away from you.""* That quote has stuck with me ever since. I have never forgotten those words. And never allowing them to take my time away from me, is what has eventually landed me here.

Don't be afraid of walking away from the corporate grind. Is that where the money is? Sure. *Short term.* But I chose to bet on myself instead, long term, and it's been many, many years since I harbored those feelings of hating my job like so many people here post about feeling. The fucking audacity of that guy, telling me to go work a government job instead as if that was supposed to be an insult toward my abilities. I loved those government jobs. I could finally focus on the *law,* instead of every single aspect of my existence just being about billing. It's why I chose this profession in the first place.

Sure, the coffee is worse. That has to be said. If you switch to government jobs, the coffee is definitely worse. But it's a small price to pay.",136,1748802031.0,Lawyertalk,11,0.97,False

I’d prefer an ongoing conversation, not a one off. If we vibe, I love voice calls! So if you have a deep voice that’s a +

So, I figured I'd put myself out there in the vast Reddit universe and see if I could find some fellow humans who are down to build a worthwhile friendship.

I'm someone who deeply values connection - not just ''hey wyd'' once a week, but real deep convos, random memes, deep dives into human behavior at 2am, or just chilling in silence while gaming or flying a 737 across Europe.

Here's some of the stuff I'm into:

Honkai Star Rail - let's talk lore, let's talk builds, let's talk ''why is this boss ruining my life''

Football - the kind with the ball at your feet. I'll debate anyone who thinks Neymar isn't top 3 of our gen.

Psychology nerd - I love reading psych books and learning more about what makes us tick. If you've got book recs, toss them my way!

Philosophy - big fan of wondering what anything even means while forgetting my coffee (more like white monster) exists

Anime - I love it. Recommendations very welcome (especially while I await JJK S3 like it's my life source)

Exercise - Yes I love working out but I'd also so very much appreciate diet cheats.

Dexter - yeah, I know, I still haven't seen it. But I want to. Badly.

Flight sim enthusiast -  I fly a lot of planes virtually, mostly commercial ops. Ask me about my favorite approach. Fellow avgeeks are more than welcome.

I like to think I'm chill, funny-ish, and a good vibe to be around. Whether you want to game, chat, share life updates, spiral over anime characters, or just trade snacks and philosophy quotes - I am your person.

If you're someone who's also looking for something real, then hit me up! Drop me a DM and tell me about yourself :)",4,1748801943.0,discordfriends,0,0.84,False
1l0vv9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/LenovoLegion/comments/1l0vv9o/legion_15_booting_issue/,Legion 15 Booting Issue,"Hi all 

Hope you can help me here.  My brothers laptop has stopped working and I cant figure out why.  Its a Legion 15ACH6H.

The other day he was playing online and closed the lid and left to run and do a few things.  When he came back the fans on the laptop were running full speed with the screen blank.

He couldn't stop the fans spinning by turning the laptop off so I suggested he let the battery run done as he couldn't get the back off to disconnect the battery.

I came down today with the hope of it being able to sort something out, guess I was wrong.  On plugging the power in, without opening the lid or pressing the power button on, the fans spin up at full speed.  As soon as power introduced to the laptop the fans spin, there is no backlight on the keyboard, the charger LED or Power LED don't light up at all.  I have researched a number of articles for this, watched YouTube videos etc.  I have read a few articles about Windows Updates bricking systems I don't think any Windows updates were in progress or BIOS updates.

I've tried the following to resolve none of which have worked:

* Clean the fans, heat pipes etc in case of over heating.
* Discharge power by holding the power button for 1 minute with the power unplugged and battery disconnected
* Remove the ram/ reseat and power on 
* Disconnect the CMOS battery for 15 minutes (long i know was making a coffee)
* Reseat nVME and power on 

There are no burnt spots I can see, and no smell of burning from any of the components.

I intend to remove all the heat pipes, re-paste the CPU and GPU with Thermogrizzly as its about 7 years old and used quite a bit.  I don't think that will help but would give it a try

Thanks for your time and any help would to get this to boot would be greatly appreciated.   ",1,1748801943.0,LenovoLegion,5,1.0,False
1l0vuxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1l0vuxy/the_role_of_games_in_social_life_or_why_are_my/,"The role of games in social life; or, why are my friends so obsessed with playing games?","*\[I hope this post isn’t out of place here. I’ve fairly new to the community, but have been reading around here for a couple weeks now and thought what I’ve written below might (but also maybe not) be of interest to some people here. I have not connected the reflections to any extant literature; but if someone is aware of work that connects with some of the things I’m describing, then please let me know. Also, for context, the friends I refer to are all in their late twenties or early thirties.\]*

Here is one example: I’m at a small get-together. It’s a group of five or six fairly close friends, all sitting in the living room, chatting about nothing in particular. I notice one friend eyeing a book of crossword puzzles that happens to be lying on the coffee table. Eventually, looking a little hesitant, the friend asks whether we’d all be interested in doing a crossword together. A couple people seem to be thinking it over, but after a moment of collective reflection, the suggestion is politely rejected. It's not the first time I've witnessed someone in the group propose a game or activity that would take the place of our talking.

Another example: I once invited this same group of friends to a family cabin. We stayed two nights there. Aside from eating and sleeping, we spent nearly the entire trip playing games.

I don’t have anything against games *per se*, but the relationship some of my friends (and to some extent myself) appear to have with them often strikes me as problematic. It seems to border on the compulsive. I also play bar trivia with these same people and there are a couple people who attach such importance to winning that they frequently suggest we award ourselves points for answers that are nearly correct, but definitely not; or else they want get up and talk to the emcee about whether we could get a half point. If we’re playing games at a party, like, say, charades, they are especially fond of playing “girls versus guys.” I think it’s because this way of making teams brings out certain tribalistic impulses, which helps to heighten their emotional and psychological investment in the outcome. All of it seems very embarrassing, but also a little sad to me. 

Below are a few reflections on what this behaviour might mean.

Thinking of the first (crossword) example, I suppose the most straightforward explanation would be that the reason we’re often willing to leave our conversation behind for something else is that our conversations are usually quite boring. When there is talk, it tends to be the standard smalltalk consumers living in a consumerist society are inclined to fall into; it’s about the things they bought, the things they'd like to buy, the places they might or won't go buy them. Or if they're feeling more sophisticated, what media been consuming lately. 

But, for me, such an explanation just raises the question of why we're not trying to have more *meaningful* conversations. It’s true that the people in this group are not intellectually inclined, but they are also not stupid. Most of them are fairly intelligent. They're all educated (most of them have graduate degrees). In other words, it would seem as though they have the requisite ""tools"" and capacities to sustain a richer and more mature dialogue, if they wanted to.

I guess my suspicion is that they don’t—and that this creates a problem for them. Because, while they lack the motivation to engage in better conversations, they *are aware that there are things they probably should be talking about*—insofar as they like to think of themselves as good, responsible citizens—and that in relation to those more important things, the subjects they usually stick to in conversation are shamefully vapid. They also, I assume, have some understanding that they belong to a relatively privileged class (materially and culturally), which means that they are in a better position than many others to effect real change. Thus they can only carry on their idle talk for so long before it begins to make them feel uneasy. 

One thought that suggests itself almost automatically when confronted with adults who appear content to do most of their socializing with other adults over board games, is that this behaviour is childish. In a way, this makes perfect sense. For if there is a common underlying sense of guilt, stemming from a feeling each has that they are, to a greater or lesser extent, shirking certain civic responsibilities in the way they're choosing to relate to their fellow citizens, what better kind of activity could they pick to forget those unpleasant feelings than one that recalls the sense of being a kid? Playing games offers a way to re-experience, for a brief period, the innocence of childhood. Perhaps we crave that feeling in proportion to how aware we are of all the ways in which modern life implicates us in the various forms of exploitation, destruction, and death going on around the world.

Something else that I thought about is how games might help folks cope with the existential burdens that, though not unique to meritocratic cultures, certainly find acute expression in them. The idea that your share in your society's wealth (financial, material, cultural) is a function of how much you merit it, is one that leads, rather predictably, to a society full of people who worry constantly about whether they are, will be, or at least *could be* good enough to ""make it."" Perhaps one can get some, albeit fleeting, relief from this kind of anxiety by playing games. Particularly games that demand a sufficient degree of skill offer players the chance to reassure themselves, in a low-risk environment, that they have what it takes to succeed more generally. Without this broader resonance with life outside the game, it's hard to imagine how people could become so emotionally invested them.

But in addition to offering reassurance as to the adequacy of one’s abilities, the game itself, the spectacle of it, can help to reaffirm our commitment to a particular way of life. What kinds of ideological work might we be accomplishing when we get together and play games with our friends? Most simply, we verify the connection between competition and pleasure. And not abstractly either; our enjoyment serves as a concrete testament to the value of competition in our own lives. We might also say that the more our socializing takes the form of playing games, the more disposed we become to thinking of competition as an appropriate principal around which to organize a society. 

The moment of victory also helps sustain an illusion that I think most of us, to one degree or another, labour under, which is that our lives are moving toward some transcendent moment, a moment that will retroactively and unambiguously justify all the worrying and grinding our lives have entailed up until then. Seeing others win wets our appetite for this moment; and if it's us who wins, we interpret the high as a foretaste, a glimpse of the bigger high that is waiting for us down the line (so long as we make the right moves), whose effects will be more lasting, hopefully permanent. In either case, we find a reason to keep going, keep getting better.    

Finally, the broader phenomenon of gamification helps ""prove"" the validity of the game-life analogy. Structuring familiar activities like games (exercise, learning, dating, *etc.*) creates opportunities to satisfy a relentless (because it has been internalized) expectation for productivity. When our stats increase or our avatar unlocks an achievement and we experience relief, we witness the “effectiveness” of this analogy and learn to place more trust in it. Indeed, the more trust we place in it, the closer we move to a point where we cease to think of it as analogy at all, i.e., the closer we get to thinking that *life* *really is a game*.

1l0vtw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATstudy/comments/1l0vtw8/my_2_cents_to_people_joining_their_mba/,My 2 cents to people joining their MBA,"[Written by a senior (not me)]

A batch of 2024 passout here. 

1. Prepare well for your placements. If you don't have workex, do some internships, or whatever you can to fill up your CV with keywords before you join your MBA. Everything is all fun and happiness in those 2 years, but if you don't end up with a good job, many of us won't look at those times with affection.


 
2. Even if you don't have a profile good enough for getting into consulting, still prepare case studies and guesstimates. They for sure will increase your knowledge, structure your thinking and teach you excellent verbalisation of your thoughts. Read Case in Point till page 100.


  
3. Don't join your MBA without a good Master CV and having all the failures, achievements, learnings, PORs and impact of whatever you've done in your grad, school, personal life, workex and internships. This will save you 10x efforts while preparing your CV and batch profile as well as you'll already have answers to 80% of the HR questions.



4. Shortlists for summers and finals are a very random process. So don't get disheartened of all your homies and girls get good shortlists but you don't. You'll soon get one too. All you can do is prepare a good CV and then hope for the best. You CANNOT target a shortlist. That's not how it works. However if you are fixated on a company, you can do your fucking absolute best in its case competition and get a PPI. 



5. Unless you want to get in the Dean's merit list or something, MBA grades don't really matter. Just don't fail anything. Anything above 7.5 is okay



6. The people around you decide what kind of 2 years you'll have. Trust me, you become an average of the people you spend your time most with. So find out good people and stick to them. 
  


7. Be kind and polite and do a couple of things for those around you. Create a sense of reciprocity.  
 



8. If the golden rule is ""Do to people what you'd like to be done to you"" then the platinum rule is that ""Do to people what they'd like to be done to them"".
 


9. Be respectful and talk well to people. Looks for sure matter, but not as much as we think they do and they're just an entry level criteria. 
  


10. MBA is that time when you may or may not have money, but you have all the freedom you want. Make good use of it. 



11. About s*x, I know a lot of us go into BSchools hoping that we'd get a lot of it. True, you can get a lot of it, given you look somewhat decent and have a good personality. However the irony is that after you do get a lot of casual s*x, you'll realise that casual s*x is not what you want. S*x as a form of communicating the love you have for someone is everything you need.  
 


12. Relationships. Be clear about what you want: whether its something serious or casual or whether you don't have clarity. Be honest and communicate this to the potential partners you might be having. I've seen people giving false commitments and then withdrawing, leaving the other person broken beyond repair. Do not cheat. Don't hurt anyone, because trust me, when the hurt person has the last laugh, you'll be walking out of college with 0 credibility and respect. Have seen this happening very recently in my BSchool. Remember: DO NOT SH*T WHERE YOU EAT.   



13. Draw clear boundaries with people, and stick to them. What makes you uncomfortable, communicate about it. 
 


14. Have a healthy relationship with alcohol, smoking and all other stuff. I know a lot of parties do happen and a lot of such stuff happens in them, but don't over abuse it. Alcohol fu*ks you up by fu*king up your health, your relationships and everything. A very close friend of my ex, who were IIM passouts in 2022 was engaged in multiple casual relationships at the institute, heavily drank, smoked and smoked up. Last year, she tried to kill herself by popping some pills. We saved her, but this is what overdoing things can lead to. 




15. Not everyone is worth the effort. You'll find some people who are extremely selfish and will take a lot from you, but show their true colours when it becomes inconvenient for them. They will have 0 reciprocity. Instead of wasting your time on such people, focus on the ones you want to keep forever. However DO NOT burn your bridges.




16. People won't remember you for the gpa you got or the placement you got. They'll remember you for how you made them feel. So be a good person, be kind and very polite. Create a sense of debt in people. You never know which company you might want to get referred to in the future :)  
 


17. Your health is extremely important: both mental and physical. Visit your campus therapist and keep exercising. Keep your room pleasent and clean. 
  


18. Be very clear about money. It is the biggest factor that spoils relationships. Make splitwise your best friend. Talk to your circle and decide whether you'll be adding the 18 rupees sutta, 20 rupees coffee, 50 rupees auto kind of expenses to your splitwise. Because with time, the law of averages catches up and you all end up spending more or less equally on these miscellaneous expenses. But if only 1 or 2 people pay all the time, the amount unaccounted for can  reach in 10000s by the end of 2 years. So be clear about this.



19. Use the CATS principle: Compliment, appreciate, thank, sorry. People who speak well do get an unfair advantage. Also, the quality of your network matters, not the quantity. 



20. Learn about your summer internship company and if you do want to continue full time with it, give your best for a PPO. A PPO makes your second year extremely chill. Remember, getting a PPO is more about how you gel with your boss and the team. So be polite and respectful there as well. You may or may not achieve all your deliverables in the project, but what kind of relationship you had with the coworkers plays a large part in getting a PPO. The organisation where I was working at gave PPOs to 10 out of 13 people from by BSchool. The other 3 people had arguments a few times with their managers.  



21. Get out of your comfort zone or your MBA will be just another 2 years of your life. A moment outside the comfort zone leads to a story for life. I took that leap of faith and now I'm a completely different person than what I was when I joined. 



Finally, be humble, respect everyone and gaand faad maje karo. You'll never have such kind of resources to spend ever again (one or 
more out of money, time, energy). 
All the very best 💯❤️💞🧿




P.S: Other people are welcome to add their own suggestions   


Addition 1: Even in the best BSchools, there are always a few kids who struggle to get shortlists initially and get depressed. For 95% of the new batch, there is a tight slap that brings them back to reality from the bubble of getting into a top institute, and that is summers. If CAT XAT prep is 10, GD PI WAT prep is 100 then placement prep is 150. However I'll say it again. Don't dwell too much on shortlists. Keep doing your preparation. Me, with a 9/6/8 profile got shortlists of companies paying 3-4 lac+ stipends and got into one of those. I was shit scared when I didn't get shortlists considering my 6 and low workex and thought anything with a stipend of 50000 would be good. 

Addition 2: Tell your grad profs, ex bosses at work and internships that you'll be seeking their approval for some CV points. If your BSchool just requires the domain of your ex company in the approval email, try to get your good friends/ ex colleagues at work to approve your points. That way thoda badha chadha bhi sakte ho, but don't lie and exaggerate so much that you won't be able to defend it if asked about it in interviews. Also stay on good terms with your boss so that they approve your points without too much of scrutiny in case your BSchool allows approvals only from your managers. 

Addition 3: Use that Coursera/ udemy your company provides you before you join MBA to complete some courses in domains you like. They will add good keywords to your CV. 
 


Addition 4: Making your CV is the toughest task you'll experience. You'll have to keep it within one page, limit a point to one line, add action verbs, keywords numbers and impact all in one line. Also you'll need to make CVs for different domains (marketing, finance, general, prodman, etc). So go to your college armed with a detailed Master CV. And show your CV points to many seniors, super seniors and make them absolutely sharp and crisp. 

Addition 5: Use gestures as much as possible. Get your friends some homemade food, write your closest friend a note on how much they mean to you, or order some waffles for your roommate, take an ill friend to the hospital. On the last day of my summer internship, I bought 15-20 dairy milks worth 10 rupees and gave it to my managers, the HRs who handled us interns, my HRBP and other members of the team as a thank you. All of them got so so happy, I can't tell you. It felt like they were kids in a birthday party who got a large chocolate and a set of stationery as a return gift. Such gestures go a very long way and people WILL remember you very fondly for it, for all their lives and help you whenever needed for sure. 

P.S: **I'll soon do another ""2 cents"" post for all CAT and OMET aspirants here related to exam and gdpi prep. I actually wrote this ""2 cents"" for the ones who've or will convert a BSchool and join this year, but I'm amazed at how such kind of a post also ended up giving some motivation to those who are yet to give CAT and OMETs.**

Also, thank you for showing so much love to the post. I hope this inspires you all to work hard and get into the best BSchools :) ❤️💞
