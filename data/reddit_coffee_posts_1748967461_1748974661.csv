Desde que descobri o café de especialidade fiquei maravilhado com a diversidade de sabores que se podem encontrar, e acabei quase com a obsessão de provar mais cafés. Mas uma pessoa não pode beber tanto café...

...E os sacos de café a rondar os 250g, muitas vezes acabam por ser muito café para quem quer provar mais coisas diferentes (especialmente para o pessoal do café filtrado). Então tive a ideia de fazer um coffee club ([post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cafeDeEspecialidade/comments/1jquzpd/coffee_club/)de apresentação da ideia aqui no sub do lado) onde encomendo vários cafés de um roaster e o divido em sacos de algo a rondar as 100g e divido pelos participantes. 

Aqui o plano é que todos possamos provar mais café, então os custos (e os cafés) dividem-se por todos. 

A título de exemplo, a nossa [primeira encomenda](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeetrip/comments/1kb44k2/coffee_club_1_la_cabra_abril_2025/), foi do [La Cabra](https://lacabra.com/), mandamos vir 7 cafés diferentes, o que deu pouco mais de 80g de cada café a cada um. Foram ligeiramente menos de 600g de café e saiu a 58€ para quem recebeu o café em mão e 65€ para o que teve que ir pelo correio.

Somos cerca de 10 pessoas por agora, e temos também um grupo de whatsapp, para discutir encomendas, cafés, equipamento, etc.

Vou apostar numa encomenda de 3 em 3 meses, sendo que a próxima deverá ser para dia 1 de Julho, com o intuito de todos os participantes terem o café, o mais tardar dia 15 de Julho. Roaster e cafés a decidir por todos.

Convido-vos a juntarem-se, se tiverem interesse. Seja pelas encomendas ou pela discussão sobre tudo quanto seja café de especialidade.

Se alguém quiser o convite para o grupo que comente ou mande mensagem, porque quando pus o link noutro post aqui no reddit, o grupo foi invadido por spam bots.",1,1748974480.0,cafept,0,1.0,False

I know meeting strangers is 50/50 but I’ll explain the dumb thought that preceded this idea…

I feel as though, as much as I’ve got good friends and all, it’s like we grew up on opposing worlds, we’re from different places and occupy divergently differing worlds. For all our likes and commonalities, our fear is different, our pain is different, our worst and best moments, our concepts and common reference points all differ not by gradation but by extremity of degree.

It’s just I’m tired of noticing that lack of sameness, that slight of-kilter disharmony that underwrites every conversation, that’s so ever-present somewhere in my periphery.

I guess I just want normal. Normal conversation - with normal people - who scan and read as normal. And normal being relative and all, my normal is traumatised, my normal is hurt, my normal is struggling and fighting to survive, my normal is different from normal.

So that’s how I came up with the idea.

I’m 24 btw, feel like a hundred and four on the inside mind, but still.

No commitment or anything, I’m just bored and my ADHD likes novelty so feel free to DM me if u like :)

My phone startled me out of my half-asleep-half-awake state as I lay on the couch with the TV droning on in the background. I read the text from an unknown number through blurry, weary eyes. 



""*This or That? Tea or Coffee?*"". 



The look of confusion I shot my phone for a split second before I put it down to some form of spam must have been hilarious. I flicked the ringer off and nodded back off only to be awoken a second time with that god-awful sound. Again, it was from the unknown number and again it was that same question. 



This was getting, well, *odd*. 



I, annoyed and increasingly tired, turned my phone off entirely but before I could even close my eyes again the ping! rang through the speakers and inexplicably those same words lit up the otherwise dark screen. 



How the *fuck* was I getting a text when my phone was off?



I had enough. With my phone now switched back on and my mind swirling I typed out a paragraph of expletives before the urge to do something else took over. I decided to humour whoever this was. You want me to choose? Well, damnit, I'll choose, I mumbled to myself. 



I chose ""coffee"" and promptly fell asleep without a care as to whether my phone remained on or not. I struggle to put this any other way than bluntly, but the next morning coffee no longer seemed to exist. I rolled out of bed and stumbled into the kitchen to start brewing so it could finish up whilst I brushed my teeth and showered - like I've done every morning for some time - and couldn't seem to find my treasured bag of grounds no matter where I looked. I get cranky when I'm without coffee, so I put it down to misplacing it and my still-tired brain struggling to remember where, so decided to swing by my favourite coffee shop Lucci's on the way to work. I had the usual small talk with the server who knew my order by heart at this point and proceeded to make the same old joke. 



""*The usual please.*"" 



He looked at me like I had two heads. 



I went to fill the awkward silence that followed when another text came through. Part of me knew what it would be before I even looked, but I hadn't yet put the pieces together. Not until the stakes were raised. 



""*This or That? Luna or Sol?*"" 



Knowing it was somehow able to keep pestering me regardless of my non-responses, I chose ""This"". I got home that day to find my puppy Luna had disappeared. There was no way out. No window to jump out of, no attic to hide in. Nothing. Her brother Sol moped all evening. 



I never found her. 



By the time the next text came through as I was ruffling through cardboard boxes and head-height cabinets in my desperately futile attempts to find my dear baby, I refused to play along. I couldn't possibly convince anybody else, but those texts were emitting something badly wrong into the world. Into my life. 



And as if in tune with my deepest thoughts, it knew I wouldn't play. Because this text came with a warning. 



""*Mom or Dad?*"" 



""*Failure to choose immediately will result in a choice being made for you.*"" 



I rationalised it. Told myself I'd rather have a bad thing happen without my direct influence. Even if said bad thing was something that made me stomach churn. 



So I never chose. 



Knowing what was coming, I called both of my parents minutes later. 



The search party for Mom began a few days after she vanished. We never found her either. 



As I lay depressed and halfway through a bottle of whiskey on the same old couch earlier tonight, that familiar ping! came through once again.  



""*This or That? Spine or Skull?*"" 



Something has been whispering through the underside of my bedroom door ever since.

My periods have ALWAYS been regular, I haven't missed a single one in my entire life as I don't gave kids, and they still are. The exam in November showed thick endometrium 18 mm, presumably ovarian follicular cyst and I was prescribed Primolut, which caused horrific bleeding on day 3 after stopping it, but didn't mess my subsequent cycles in any way... boy I was glad to stop the med... but then on the very next exam, a doctor saw a polyp and scheduled MIS to remove it... the exam was like 5 seconds, here it is, procedure. That didn't sound right AT ALL. I simply paid a private practice visit... 3 times. NO POLYP. On the 3rd occasion, my doctor caught the folicule that was about to rupture. Needless to say, I've been flipping for quite a while with simply preserving my reproductive health... To cut the story short, fast forward to the beginning of May, candida was killing me, clotrimazole caused light weird bleeding... but at the same time I started feeling something I've never felt in my life. Smelling everything in the world... coffee tasting so obnoxious, bitter and sour... my breasts swelling and areolas becoming crazy huge... water tasting sweet... hairs growing very fast, suddenly strong and curly... bloating, burping as if on Primolut again, dizziness... extreme cold... but I got what looked like a period on May 8th. Tested afterwards, negative. Three times. I was ready to write it off but my breasts are reminding me that they are so sensitive... nausea comes and goes... peeing like crazy on and off... and my stomach feels weird, all sorts of sudden cramps, tightness... ok, I'll do the bloodwork in the next days and schedule a visit, but in the meantime I tested again. No digital tests over here, the standard one seems to show something... or nothing? 😩 I'm at a loss, kinda flipping as I am 48 and turning 49 in August! No IVFs, no trying for years, I really wasn't thinking that 0.5 chance is a chance even with IVF... I just need some friendly word till I'm waiting, another pair of line eyes, someone knowing someone who at my age had any success with becoming pregnant in such a straightforward way... ❤️ I don't have high hopes even though I'd love so much for this to be true and I swear I feel different than my usual self... and I am kinda scared what is going on if it's not pregnancy. Symptoms were just jumping out one after the other, I couldn't possibly immagine them, or make my belly or inner thigh hairs grow crazy lengths day after day 🤣🙏🍀 or sharp pulling all of a sudden if I twist, small left then right stabs... Thank you all... and good luck, I do wish I had better chances or smarter head when I was younger.

1l2j3gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1l2j3gn/howwhen_should_i_confess_to_my_friend/,How/when should I confess to my friend?,"This is a bit long, but stay with me for a bit please. 
My crush and I met in our first semester at university and became friends during the first few weeks of classes. Towards the middle/end of the semester, I started developing feelings for him. I started looking forward to seeing him way too much, smiled and giggled about every cute thing he said for days, it was bad. I got some mixed signals, he said some slightly flirty and very sweet things, and he's not ""just a flirty person"" at all, he's rather shy and a bit reserved. This was around one and a half years ago. 

Around a year ago, I shot my shot and asked him for coffee just the two of us (at the time we usually met in a group setting). He very politely declined, saying that between work and an internship, he didn't really have a lot of free time at the moment. He didn't suggest a later time after his internship ended or anything, so I told him he could always change his mind about it but left it at that and accepted the rejection. We stayed friends, I think we are closer now then we were back then, and everything was okay – I got over him, had little crushes on other men, all was well. Until I caught feelings, again. 

It happened a couple weeks ago, when I caught some mixed signals again, and it confused me so much (emotionally). We started hugging goodbye, he sometimes looks me in the eyes very intensely, one tome in class our knees touched and neither one of us moved away for a solid hour, he became much more comfortable and seems to be a bit physically closer ro me than before, like leaning really close ro talk in class. But there are also no explicit hints or moves or anything. 

Now I started wondering if he maybe didn't get that I asked him for a date back then. I didn't explicitly say ""date"", but assumed it was pretty obvious anyways. But he also seems like a guy who'd miss the hint if I screamed it in his lol. So I am thinking about confessing a bit more clearly again, but I am also scared. What if he got it, didn't have feelings, and is annoyed if I bring it up a second time? 
I was thinking of confessing the last week of classes (in like 5 weeks), so that we don't have ro see each other for a while afterwards if it's too uncomfortable or if he's weirded out. But also, after classes ended, we also would have some free time for potential dates. On the other hand, there's exams after classes, so that's stressful, and I don't want to put any additional pressure on him during this already stressful time. But we usually don't see each other during term break (unles we'd make a conscious effort to), so I probably wouldn't be able to confess in a more natural, dynamic situation (I don't want to make a huge deal out of it). 
I usually walk him to his next class after a class we have together once a week, and I thought about confessing then, but that'd suck, too. I really don't know what to do. 

Please give me some advice or perspective.  What would be the least uncomfortable way to do this?

We were a group of 4 adults and a 1.5 year old coming for a long weekend in May/June 

Airbnb:
-We stayed in the D’Esire building in the heart of the ZR and it was PERFECT!! The location seriously was in the middle of all the action. We could get pretty much anywhere we wanted to go within a 15 min walk (at the absolute most, that was to get a neighborhood over), tons of things within 5 min 
-Gorgeous building with friendly front desk, beautiful rooftop pool that we pretty much always had to ourselves and a bartender that worked the afternoons (you were still allowed to bring your own drinks as long as they weren’t glass) 
-Only thing to note is if you’re bringing older kids and plan to be out walking at night, I would consider a different area. There is definitely opportunity to walk past PG-13/R content haha thankfully this was pretty much a non issue since my daughter is in bed by 8:30 but there were a few shops with sexual innuendo/products in them that are visible even from the street during the day so just wanted to mention that for folks traveling with kids so that if you decide to stay in the area you’re prepared! 

Restaurants: 
We were only in town a few days so I didn’t get to even scratch the surface of places we wanted to try but I’ll list what we did try and how we liked it — this is from the perspective of folks from Texas where it is fairly easy to get good Mexican food (tho obviously not as easy as it is in Mexico LOL but I like to think we have decent taste haha) 
-Pipis: ugh, I should’ve listened to y’all. This place was a really fun vibe - huge margaritas and loud music, the baby loved it and it was the only place that had a high chair I could actually strip her into but the food was pretty mid. Not terrible but I have had way better in Texas and the prices were on the higher side for the quality for the area so I wouldn’t go back unless I was going for margaritas and apps 
-Red Cabbage: holy crap, this place was SO good! The mole chicken and homemade tortillas were to die for. Seriously every part of this meal was fantastic and the service was great. The interior is so fun and colorful too. It was well worth the 15 min walk. I think we paid around 2000 pesos (including tip) for 4 entrees, 2 soups, a dessert and 4 water bottles
-Don Chava Tacos - great little spot for tacos that you can actually sit at a table for. Excellent chips and guac, great
Margaritas, affordable prices 
-The Pancake House - this was right next to our building so we stopped in. Paid about $25 US for 2 coffee drinks and 2 meals which felt fair. Food was decent and service was excellent. Good speedy spot for breakfast on the go
-Coco’s Kitchen - not a ton of “authentic” options on the menu but the service was great, the food was really good and the atmosphere in the garden was really fun! The chilaquiles and French toast were really excellent! Overall I liked it a lot better than the pancake house 
-Tuna Azul - Margarita were fantastic and we all really loved the marlin tacos and ceviche. I’m gonna be honest that the raw tuna dishes weren’t my favorite as much as I hate to say it. I’m kinda a picky person when it comes to meat/fish cuz of sensory stuff and I got a few chewy pieces of tuna that threw me off. Really nice service though and fun vibes, I’d go again and just order differently his time 
-The Churro Guy - not the best I’ve ever had but they’re dirt cheap and a nice treat while walking around!
-La Romantica Churros - SO good and I loved that they had dipping sauces 
-Crema Barra De Espresso - got an iced vanilla latte and it was so good and the perfect amt of sweet! Didn’t have breakfast the day we went so I have no idea how that is 

Miscellaneous tips/thoughts:
-If you’re not planning to cook at the house, don’t bother with grocery delivery. We paid for it and while the folks who got our groceries were wonderful I regret wasting money on the service when there are like 5 million pharmacies and stores within walking distance (if you’re in ZR) to get the basics of what you need 
-Get enough pesos to pay for most of your meals as a lot of places don’t take cards or do but clearly prefer cash
-Make sure to decline the daily exchange rate on ATMs
-If you’re bringing your toddler and they are capable of climbing out of high chairs if not strapped in you may want to consider bringing a travel high chair yourself (like
The iglesia). Our dinners were kinda rough cuz we spent the whole time reminding our daughter she needed to sit on her bottom lol 
-The sunburns come on fast even in overcast weather! I am very pale and thought I was in the shade bc it was so overcast but somehow managed to painfully burn the lower half of my legs

I don’t know what came over me, but I’ve been doing a rewatch of our show and recently watched “The Housekeeper”. And while this was an out of left field, really a standalone episode, it was very funny.

However, there is one moment that I just for the life of me can’t figure out if it was a reference to a pop culture moment, which this show did wonderful at referencing (Thirty something, Michael J Fox, Jimmy Swaggart) or if it was meant to simply be a punchline “haha, the irony” moment and that as you can see from the title, is the incident when Dorothy tries to normalize the strange happenings after Marguerite’s firing. A man in a bird costume and parachute lands on the lanai, causing the audience to lose it.

The scene ends with him asking “This isn’t the orange bowl, is it?” and the audience again laughing and even applauding. To this day, I never found out nor could I find anything on my personal Google search, and was wondering if an incident had happened that year that the show poked fun at? Or was it simply meant to be a surreal moment that was the cherry on top of Dorthy’s line and the occurrences happening?

I’ve never figured it out and I am almost embarrassed to ask seeing as I also asked about Mr. Terrific recently and the answer was right in my face.

I'm 40F and recently decided (yet again!) to give online dating a go, after not for a few years. 

I won't go into the myriad of reasons I find it a less than ideal way to meet people, but one is that I think, I basically don't know where to start when faced with a sea of faces and with scant profiles. One thing I've been keen to bring up early on - within the first couple of dates if we meet quickly ,  or within about a week of chatting,  is people's political views. 

Now, I'm not saying one is right or wrong, just that I've always thought one's political stance tells you quite a lot about how they view the world and about their values.

I had a second date last week, after a quick coffee the week before  and brought up the politics chat. It was clear we had polar opposite views.  I was open and vocal about mine and why I've problems with some of the people they support.  But also kept it light and was able to joke and move on to chatting about other things. 

The next day I politely shut down the suggestion of a third date because I felt we weren't compatible with such opposing political views.  I thought it indicated a core incompatibility that wouldn't make for a lasting relationship and I didn't want to waste anyone's time. 

What do you think? A good indicator of potential compatibility or am I getting too hung up on one facet only?

I used to be an alcoholic and after a sort of intervention a few years ago I started going to SMART meetings (for less than a year iirc; have not attended or thought about SMART in a while, until recently). The solidarity was helpful and the exercises were good at feeling productive or for distracting for the duration of working on one.

I've found in the years since though that beyond the immediate moment (the time while at meetings, the time while doing an exercise) my baseline never changed, and my compulsion to be in an altered state has just moved around from alcohol to delta9 to kratom--the last of which has been slowly eroding any stability in my life (it doesn't impair me, which is the main perk, but I'm also starting to worry it's deadening my ability to taste. And more than that it's eating up whatever money I have while I have it). But it seems to be (beyond that unrelenting need for a high) a moderation issue; kratom was actually recommended to me as a substitute for alcohol. And that helped, and it's true that every time i'm buying kratom i'm grateful it's not alcohol and that i don't have to deal with all the consequences of being shitfaced... but 1) kratom is exponentially more expensive than a tallboy and 2) kratom as a mocktail or calming dose (at the level of choosing tea over coffee, as is ideally recommended) is never enough, for why I'm taking it in the first place. I'm now at the point where i can take multiple kratom shooters a day, which is almost required for the effect (and soooo much more expensive than I can afford/should spend money on).

At the end of the day (since the only alternative times i feel happiest are when i have no responsibilities and other people facilitate and share in the things i enjoy--yeah, i know 😓) i only feel good when i have some kind of buzz. This is after quitting alcohol, after taking up exercise and spending time outside, after doing things i like, etc, all that. And when I invest in my passions the time passes and i will be content, same as when I'm ""doing something else"" of any kind, including SMART work, but whenever the day returns to its normal, in-between, regular existence then being sober exhausts me, bores me, depresses me. The idea of being sober (of all substances) intentionally for the rest of my life seems so despondently lackluster to me that it's almost funny. And it's not that i don't enjoy the little things in all the rest of life. It's just that none of it makes me /feel/ good the way substances do.

How would y'all use SMART to replace the need for chemical highs, or what would be your advice on finding sobriety itself uplifiting?

Tl;dr I have recovered from various substance abuses (though currently amidst one) and just never find sober life to be enough--at least, not when /I/ manage the things I enjoy (whatever things fulfill me are only truly absorbing when I don't have a hand in their realization, and the rest of the time sobriety feels like a lack).

After a week of being constipated I took some laxatives, developed a fever and went to the hospital. I had had some minor pain but that really just felt like it was because I was so backed up. The CT Scan showed I had a ruptured pocket so I was admitted for a few days and given IV antibiotics. For a year after that I was completely fine and didn’t really think about it.

Then a couple of weeks ago I realized I hadn’t poo’d in a day or so and with it being near the year anniversary I became concerned. Thinking back to the last year and hospital visit I tried to replicate what happened there; I switched to a clear liquid diet to see if I could get things moving without adding more solids to add to the issue. After a few days (once my day off hit) I again took some laxatives, developed a fever that night and after a couple of days of a lingering fever I headed to the hospital. This time the CT Scan showed a 1.3 cm abscess. Admitted again for a few days with IV antibiotics. It ended up being the exact same day, 5/23/25. 

I haven’t had a colonoscopy yet, planning on getting that done over the summer. But I guess I’m wondering about my lack of pain. Realizing this subreddit exists has been great for information gathering but I also see everyone talking about how much pain they have. The only reason I even realized I had an issue is because I’m typically doing intermittent fasting/One Meal a Day and am very regular every morning after my coffee. So not having a movement in a couple days was very noticeable. Other than that, are there any other signs I could try to look out for to give me a heads up I’m having an issue?",2,1748973749.0,Diverticulitis,1,1.0,False

I 36F, met a man 36M about 4 months ago through a dating app. A little background info: He was divorced, 13 year marriage (had one son 7 y/o and a step daughter 14 y/o), it had been 1.5yrs since they separated and divorced and he was ready to date again. I was not the first person he dated since the divorce; but that didn’t last long because he had boundaries on when he would introduce his kids and she didn’t respect that.
Fast forward to me. We met for coffee and hit it off, everything was amazing. We fell completely in love. He loved me in ways I’ve never been loved. I felt as though my prayers had finally been answered and I found this amazing man (which I still believe). I have not met his kids, but they know about me and are fully aware we are dating, which is a step in the direction to meeting them. 
We recently went on our first trip together, to Disneyland (without kids) and had a blast, we both had a great time together. But the days following our return I noticed some subtle changes.. he seemed to forget to text me sometimes, he mentioned he wasn’t sleeping well.. then this past Sunday he was out with his son, we had plans to meet after he dropped him off and he shoots me a text starting it with “hey there” which is completely out of character, as he always calls me babe or my love.. and he cancels our plans because his son wants to stay an extra night. I have no problem with that. However, the “hey there” really bothered me, so I express my concerns and that I’m feeling something is off since we came back and he confirms that he has a lot on his mind and that he didn’t want to discuss it at that time due to being with his son. I respect that and thank him for communicating that with me. Well, after that I don’t hear from him, which is also out of character. I text him at midnight because I woke up in a panic and noticed I never received a text they made it home. Next morning (yesterday) I get a text that they are fine and that’s about it. At 5:30pm I call him and send a text letting him know I’m feeling a little uneasy since our communication has been off, and I know he has a lot going on (ex wife messing with custody) and he basically replies with: “You’re not wrong that I have a lot going on. Disneyland brought a few things up in me that I need to deal with. No, it’s nothing you did or said. It’s all me. I thought I was ready but I am not”
I feel blindsided, everything was great, we had a great relationship. It was short, but in that short amount of time we fell completely love. We had something special that people search a lifetime for. 
My question to you all is; do you think he just needs some time to work through things, that maybe he freaked out, got cold feet and will come to realize he does want to be in this relationship?  Should I reach out in a few days? I don’t want to push him further away, but I also want him to know I am here for him, which I have already mentioned. I’m just at a loss and completely heartbroken.

TL;DR: Dating divorced(1.5 yrs) man, he broke things off saying he thought he was ready for a relationship but isn’t. Will he return?

What if you were a young aspiring wizard, hopeful and filled with curiosity? What if you were visiting a land from your youth, long since left behind but always calling to your soul? Or What if you were a sheltered Princess, desperate to prove yourself to the people you are destined to rule? What would you do should the shadows of destiny begin to shape themselves in the distance? 

The Trials of Andoria is an epic, episodic fantasy series about just that. A small group of strangers find themselves wrapped up in what they believe is the threat of war on their borders. A desperate plan is hatched, and executed, but leaves even more questions. What they discover on foreign shores will shake them to their core, and uncover secrets that reveal how truly connected they are. Written as both a loving tribute to JRPG and Dungeon and Dragon universes, *Trials* seeks to add another entry to the annals of fantasy history. 

Told from a unique 'third person-party' style, the series presents action, intrigue, and personal discovery through the experiences of each of the main story heroes. Throughout, many nods to games and gaming touch on the special relationship between human beings and games, and the notion that life, itself, might too be a game.

I’m a 38-year-old guy, originally from Brazil, but I’ve been calling the Netherlands home for quite some time now. After many great years in Rotterdam, I recently moved to Utrecht to live with my Dutch boyfriend — and now I’m on the lookout for some new friends and good vibes in the area!

By day, I work as a supply chain manager — the usual office stuff (yes, it can get a little boring), but it gives me the chance to travel a lot, which I absolutely love. Whether it’s a spontaneous road trip, a beach weekend in Spain, hiking through Norway, or discovering a tiny Italian village with amazing food — if it’s a trip, I’m in!

Here’s a bit more about me:

🎬 I love going to the cinema — my favorite spot in Utrecht is Louis Hartlooper. I’m into indie and artsy films, but I’m always down for a good blockbuster or a movie night at home with classics.

🍝 I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes. I’m also totally obsessed with ice cream — I even have my own machine and love inventing new flavors!

☕ Big fan of coffee and breakfast spots — always on the hunt for new cafés to try. I also enjoy a good dinner out, a glass of wine, or just a chill biertje.

🏐 I’m quite sportive — I do CrossFit, play volleyball weekly, and just got back into weightlifting.

🚲 I’m into anything outdoorsy: hiking, biking, picnics, you name it.

🎶 You’ll also find me at the occasional festival or even a classical music concert from time to time.

I’m hoping to meet people who are also looking to expand their social circle — whether it's for grabbing coffee, catching a movie, cooking together, going for a walk, or just hanging out and chatting. If anything here resonates with you, feel free to send a message!

The alarms scream and lights flash red, and scientists scramble as they try to contain their prisoner. To keep the world from ending. The lead scientist watches from the control room, watches as the monitors display alarming variables and dangerous status reports. In the front of the room, there’s a panel of 5-inch thick, bulletproof glass. Behind that glass is a massive room, in the middle of which is a cube created from the strongest alloy known to man.   
  
The cube is glowing white-hot, and is beginning to melt. Some scientists leave, running out of the room, hoping to save themselves. The lead scientist watches as they go, not judging them for putting themselves first, but grateful for the ones that stayed. The cube begins to drip, some sections falling away as they melt, revealing the prisoner within.  
  
The Core is a baseball-sized orb, floating in place via a technology that has never been replicated in recorded history. It spins slowly, and pulsates with a soft red light. It almost seems innocent, if you ignore the fact several hundred people have devoted their lives to imprisoning it, and that currently, it’s breaking containment. The scientists click buttons and type furiously on computers, doing everything in their power to sedate the beast- but all to no avail.   
  
The cube is now halfway destroyed, the other half seemingly ready to follow its example. One by one, the scientists stop typing. They give up, but most don’t run. The lead scientist assumes they thought the same thing she did at that point. *“A scientist always goes down with their life’s work”* The entire cube is no longer a cube. Now it sits as a molten puddle on the floor of the containment room, revealing the orb in full. It hovers there, ominously, the gray exterior flashing red, as if mimicking the flashing lights of the alarm.  
  
 It begins to spin, faster and faster, as if gleeful that it escaped its prison.“Rig the reactor” the lead scientist says in a sad but determined voice. Her employees understand instantly, and begin typing something new on their keyboards. The large monitor that originally displayed the containment’s declining status now presented a warning.   
  
“REACTOR FAILURE IMMINENT– T-MINUS 10 SECONDS”   
  
She relaxed- she wasn’t going to escape either way, she might as well take The Core along with her. The scientists seemed to agree. They leaned back in their chairs, some looked at photos of their family, others drank their last sips of coffee. One played Tetris. Only two tried to leave, scrambling for their cars as fast as they could. The others knew it was useless. They weren't leaving alive.

The idea is all about habit stacking, where you piggyback a new habit onto an existing one. Here's how it works for conversations: 

Whenever I grab my morning coffee—or even when I'm just out walking my dog—I make it a point to strike up a chat with at least one stranger. It's super casual, like mentioning how nice the weather is or complimenting something they're wearing. Tbh, people are usually pretty receptive, and it sorta sets a friendly tone for the rest of my day.

I think the key is not overthinking it. Just let it flow naturally from whatever you're already doing. Plus, it can lead to some interesting stories or new connections! It's def made me feel more open and social, even on days when I'd typically keep to myself. 

Anyway, if you're like me and kinda shy when it comes to new people, give this a shot. Let me know if you try it and how it goes! 😊",7,1748972073.0,mindHacksToday,0,1.0,False

I have lived and worked in Philly or the surrounding area for my entire life. I notice this city is recommended a lot on this sub and for good reason! It has a lot going for it. But I may have the opportunity to take on a remote (with travel) role with my company, so it seems as good a time as any to explore some new places for a change of scenery. Ideally I’d find something smaller, quieter and less congested, so smaller cities/towns or more rural areas maybe.

I would continue renting for now, so if I could get a 1 bed for under $1800 that would be great. No plans for kids so schools don’t matter to me.

Because of frequent travel I’d like to be within an hour or so of an airport - ideally one that could get me to most areas of the country within 2 flights. For example TYS in Knoxville is a pretty small airport, but big enough to have frequent flights to ATL/Chicago etc so easy to get to most other places.

I love having variety in the weather/seasons, and I absolutely love a good thunderstorm. The heat isn’t my favorite though, and I know those often go hand in hand. But if I could hide from the sun with some shady areas or air conditioning I might do Ok. Autumn is my favorite season and pretty fall colors are a bonus. Snow is not a requirement but I do enjoy it! I have some family in southern CA but I think the year round sunny and 70s would depress me.

Nature (any kind, but trees > the rest) is important - I’d like hiking and/or just some scenic drives close by. I’m turning into a hermit crab in my old age, so I don’t really need much of a nightlife scene, but a library/bookstore, coffee shop or a beer garden would be nice. I really mostly just read in my free time.

I have some time off in a couple weeks so I’m thinking of roadtripping to eastern Tennessee. Knoxville or Chattanooga areas are on my radar, but I’m wondering if there are other areas you guys would suggest? Western NC looks incredible but less convenient for travel.

# Dancing Away High Blood Pressure and Bad Cholesterol: My Journey with Zumba Classes in Santa Ana, Ca



Last year, my doctor delivered news I wasn't ready to hear: my blood pressure was creeping into dangerous territory, and my cholesterol numbers looked like a recipe for future heart problems. At 44, I thought I had more time before worrying about these ""old people"" health issues. That's when my neighbor Maria suggested something that sounded almost too good to be true – dancing my way back to health through [Zumba](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbasantaana/zumba-santa-ana).



# When Traditional Exercise Feels Like Punishment

I'll be honest – I've never been the gym type. Treadmills bore me to tears, and lifting weights makes me feel awkward and out of place. Every January, I'd start some new fitness routine with the best intentions, only to quit by February because it felt like punishment rather than self-care. The idea that exercise could actually be enjoyable seemed foreign to me.

But there's something different about[ Zumba](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbasantaana/zumba-santa-ana). Maybe it's the pulsing Latin beats that make you forget you're working out, or perhaps it's the infectious energy of moving with a group of people who are all there for the same reason – to feel better, both physically and mentally.



# The Science Behind the Sweat

What I discovered through my own research (and later confirmed by my cardiologist) is that Zumba creates the perfect storm for cardiovascular improvement. When you're dancing for 45-60 minutes straight, your heart rate stays elevated in what exercise physiologists call the ""aerobic zone"" – that sweet spot where your body becomes incredibly efficient at using oxygen and burning fat.

Here's what happens inside your body during a typical [Zumba ](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbasantaana/zumba-santa-ana)session: your heart muscle gets stronger with each beat, your blood vessels become more flexible and responsive, and your liver starts processing cholesterol more effectively. It's like giving your entire cardiovascular system a tune-up, except instead of being stuck in a mechanic's waiting room, you're having the time of your life.

The interval nature of Zumba – where high-energy songs alternate with slightly more moderate movements – mimics high-intensity interval training (HIIT) without the intimidation factor. Your body gets all the benefits of varied intensity training, but your mind is focused on following the instructor's moves rather than watching the clock.



# Real Results from Real People

After three months of consistent [Zumba classes](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbasantaana/zumba-santa-ana-free-class), my blood pressure dropped from 148/94 to 128/82 – numbers that made both my doctor and me smile. But I'm not unique in this experience. Sarah, who takes classes at the same studio, saw her HDL (the good cholesterol) jump by 18 points in four months. Mike, a retired teacher who joined our group last spring, managed to reduce his blood pressure medication dosage after six months of regular dancing.

The research backs up these personal success stories. Studies tracking Zumba participants over 12-week periods consistently show improvements in both blood pressure readings and cholesterol profiles. One particularly compelling study followed 60 women who attended Zumba classes three times weekly – by the end of the study period, the average systolic blood pressure in the group had dropped by 12 points, while LDL cholesterol decreased by an average of 15%.

# Why Zumba Works When Other Exercises Don't

The secret isn't just in the physical movements – though the constant motion certainly helps. There's something almost magical about how music affects our bodies and minds. When you're caught up in the rhythm of a great salsa or merengue, your stress levels plummet. Lower stress means lower cortisol production, which directly impacts blood pressure regulation.

Plus, there's the social element that's often missing from solitary workouts. When you're laughing with classmates about forgetting the choreography or cheering each other on during particularly challenging songs, you're building the kind of support system that makes long-term lifestyle changes sustainable.

I've tried solo workouts, home fitness videos, and expensive gym memberships. Nothing stuck until I found this community of people who gather twice a week to sweat, laugh, and occasionally stumble through new routines together.



# The Unexpected Benefits

While I started [Zumba](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbasantaana/zumba-santa-ana-free-class) specifically to address my cardiovascular health concerns, the benefits extended far beyond what I expected. My energy levels throughout the day improved dramatically – no more 3 PM crashes that had me reaching for extra coffee. My sleep quality got better, probably because I was actually tired from physical activity rather than just mental exhaustion from work stress.

The weight loss was a pleasant surprise, though not my primary goal. Over six months, I lost 22 pounds without making any dramatic changes to my diet. The increased muscle tone and improved posture were bonuses I hadn't anticipated but definitely appreciated.



# Finding Your Zumba Santa Ana Community

If you're in the Orange County area and curious about experiencing these benefits yourself, I can't recommend instructor [**Teo Reyes**](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbasantaana/zumba-santa-ana-teo-reyes) highly enough. Teo teaches Zumba Santa Ana classes that welcome absolute beginners while still challenging those who've been dancing for years. Her approach removes the intimidation factor that keeps many people from trying group fitness classes.

What impressed me most about [Teo's](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbasantaana/zumba-santa-ana-teo-reyes) teaching style is how she emphasizes movement and joy over perfection. During my first class, I felt completely lost trying to follow the choreography, but Teo's encouraging attitude and the supportive atmosphere made me want to come back and try again.

# Taking That Crucial First Step

Here's something I wish someone had told me before I started: you don't need to be coordinated, you don't need special clothes, and you definitely don't need to know how to dance. All you need is a willingness to move your body and an openness to trying something new.

For anyone in the Santa Ana area who's been curious about Zumba but hesitant to jump in, [Teo Reyes](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbasantaana/zumba-santa-ana-teo-reyes) is offering [**one free class**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-santa-ana-free-saturday-9-am-class-tickets-858415011407) to newcomers. This is your chance to experience Zumba Santa Ana without any commitment or pressure – just pure fun and the beginning of what could be a transformative journey for your heart health.

My blood pressure and cholesterol numbers tell one story of improvement, but the real victory is how much better I feel every single day. Six months ago, climbing two flights of stairs left me winded. Now, I bound up those same stairs with energy to spare, often humming one of the songs from our latest Zumba routine.

The best part about improving your cardiovascular health through dance? It never feels like you're sacrificing anything. Instead, you're adding joy, community, and rhythm to your life while your heart quietly gets stronger and healthier with every beat.

We have divided our financial responsibilities fairly. My husband is earning more than me and the house we are staying now is his (technically his grandmother's but since he is the only grandchild, he will inherit it from her) so he manages the finances of the house - electricity bills, water bills, heating bills, insurance, etc. I on the other hand earns enough so I took care of our groceries, restaurant bills and car gas since I work farther than him. i drop him off to his work since its on the way to my work and its only like 1km from our house. He said since its his car he takes care of the car insurance, maintenance, etc. Since, he manages most of finances and I take care of household chores, cooking, laundry, etc. which on my part is fair.

So the past few years there was nothing wrong in our routine until recently i got promoted as a supervisor. I start work at 5:30am and ends around 2:00pm. Since the promotion, I get mentally, emotionally, and physically drained from work that when I get home , I just want to eat and sleep. I am really struggling at the moment because I want to stay up until bed time and do as much household chores as much as possible. I tried drinking coffee, energy drinks but nothing beats my tiredness. So there are times that after work, I tell my husband I cannot cook dinner because I am really exhausted. Then he starts jokingly saying, ""thats okay, I will die of hunger anyway"". This really pisses me off. Ingredients are just there in front of him he just needs to cook it for himself. So I groggily cooked for him. Most of my friday nights and weekends are spent on catching up household chores etc. I literally dont have a whole day just to relax or unwind. This has been happening for 3 months. I feel really depressed and feel suffocated because the pressure I have from work and home. Recently, we had a public holiday on thursday which sadly I have to also work. My husband doesn't have to work on Thursday and he decided to make friday also. I on the otherhand have to work until Saturday and Sunday I spent on catching up household chores. The whole ""long weekend"" he spent playing pc games with online buddies. He didnt even bother just to cook for ""us"" on those days or even put away the dishwasher, no, I even have to do all this things after work. I feel exhausted and at some point just want to disappear in this world. 

To be honest, I cannot hold on to this any longer. I raised this concern to him but his excuse is I should do my part since he takes care of us financially. I feel hurt since he doesnt understand that I work fulltime too. I wake up at 4am in the morning since I shower every day. I am really concern when we have a child because I don't if I can even handle it. And I fear I wont get any help from him since he already raised his concern of not wanting a kid in the next 10 years which I complained since I would be my late 30s and I fear having the difficulty to get pregnant.

I heard Utah got some sort of weird dating scene with a “kiss w/o commitment” or something haha?

Imagine scrolling through your phone and seeing a heartbreaking news story about a famine in a faraway country children starving, families displaced, desperate for help. You feel a pang of sadness, maybe even guilt. But then you put your phone down, get on with your day, and think, “There’s nothing I can really do about it.” Sound familiar?

This common reaction is exactly what philosopher Peter Singer challenges in his powerful article, *“Famine, Affluence, and Morality.”* Singer argues that if we can prevent suffering without sacrificing something equally important, we have a moral obligation to do so even if the people in need are halfway across the world. In this blog post, I’ll unpack Singer’s argument, give a fresh example to illustrate it, and then offer a criticism to think about. By the end, you might see that distant famines aren’t as far away from our responsibilities as we like to think.

# What’s Singer’s Big Idea?

Singer wrote his article in 1972 during the Nigerian famine crisis, but his argument still shakes up how we think about poverty today.

**The core of Singer’s argument is this:** If it’s in our power to stop something bad from happening, like prevent starvation or save a life, and doing so doesn’t cost us something morally significant, then we *ought* to do it. He pushes us to reconsider our everyday spending choices could the money we spend on non-essential things instead save lives?

Singer uses the example of a shallow pond: if you see a child drowning and can save them by getting your clothes muddy, you should do it. Why? Because the small inconvenience of wet clothes is insignificant compared to the child’s life. By analogy, donating to famine relief organizations is like saving that child drowning in the pond. The only difference is distance.

He concludes that affluent people in wealthy countries have a moral duty to give much more than they currently do to aid famine victims and those in extreme poverty.

# Let’s imagine a coffee shop scenario.

You’re buying your usual fancy latte that costs $5. You learn that for just $1 donated to a reliable charity, you can provide a child with clean water for a month, preventing waterborne diseases that cause death and suffering. According to Singer’s logic, skipping your latte and donating that $5 instead could save multiple lives.

Yet most of us would probably still order the coffee. Why? Because the pleasure of your daily treat feels more immediate and real than the distant suffering. But Singer would argue that’s exactly the problem: our moral intuition shouldn’t be limited by geography or emotional proximity. The “coffee vs. clean water” trade-off is a clear example where our spending priorities reflect a moral failing, in his view.

# One Criticism: Is Singer’s Demand Too Demanding?

While Singer’s argument is compelling, many critics say it asks too much from people.

One common criticism is that Singer’s principle is *overly demanding.* If we must always give to the point of marginal utility meaning until giving more would cause us equal or greater harm this could leave people with very little for themselves. Would people be morally obligated to give up luxuries *and* essentials just to help others? Where do we draw the line?

For example, if you donate your last bit of money to charity, you might end up unable to pay your rent or buy medicine. Singer acknowledges this but suggests the line is at sacrificing something *morally significant,* not merely comfortable. Yet, critics argue that it’s difficult to define what counts as “morally significant,” and in practice, people may feel overwhelmed or paralyzed by such a strong moral demand.

# Wrapping It Up: Rethinking Our Moral Distance

Peter Singer’s *“Famine, Affluence, and Morality”* forces us to confront a challenging question: How much should we care about people suffering far away from us?

His clear, simple analogy of the drowning child asks us to rethink the excuses we often make for ignoring global poverty. By showing that moral obligations don’t vanish with distance, he calls for a radical shift in how we view charity and responsibility.

At the same time, his argument raises important questions about the limits of moral duty and personal sacrifice. While his demands may seem extreme, they spark crucial conversations about how we can do better in a connected world.

So next time you scroll past that famine story, maybe pause could your latte money save a life instead? It’s a small question with huge implications.

If you want to dive deeper, I highly recommend reading Singer’s full article. It might just change how you think about your own moral choices.

I’m a new manager and just went on my first business trip with the rest of my management team (3 others) and my Senior Director, who I report to. We’ll refer to them as SD here. 

The first day of the trip was us meeting with our Senior VP who meets with all their reports every quarter. Not relevant to the story here. 

On the second day, there was an event with the CEO at the end of the day so we all worked in the office, and we’re all seated in a large conference room that mainly composed of the senior VP’s people. This included a non-senior VP, we’ll call her Mary. Mary used to be the director of my department, but I was a few levels beneath her and didn’t report directly to her. She was my boss’s boss’s boss. She had been promoted to VP a couple years ago. She was not in my line of reporting to the senior VP but under the same umbrella. I have NO reporting connection to her now at all. 

So we’re all working in this room, not together really, just working. Sometimes we were all chatting collectively, sometimes just to a couple other people. 

At some point, my co-worker/the other manager started talking about a project he started to help team productivity. Let’s call him John. It seemed he was sharing this directly with Mary. At the same time, my other co-worker was showing me something she was working on and we were chatting about it. Then Mary addresses me and says “Alice - Do you not think what John is talking about is of value?” And I was like 😳 I looked at John and said “I am so sorry, I didn’t realize you were addressing the room” He’s looking uncomfortable. Mary goes “it doesn’t matter, he’s sharing something that can help your team. Does your team not have production issues?” 

I’m the one manager who actually doesn’t have a production based team and his project is completely irrelevant to my own but I stay quiet. 

She then goes on for a few minutes about how disrespectful it is to speak over John (I swear other people were still having their own sidebar conversations just before that, now everyone was quiet and staring). She also mentioned something about collaboration and my ears were ringing at this point, I can’t even remember. 

MY director, MY boss, has her head down and is staying quiet. Once the dressing down ends, I just say “I appreciate the feedback” 

We had ordered coffee through DoorDash which had just arrived. It had been raining pretty bad during the trip, but was now sunny and I had mentioned earlier that it was a beautiful day and it’d be nice to take a walk. 

Mary says “Oh Alice, you can go get the coffee. Didn’t you say you wanted a walk?” 

OH MY GOD!?!?! 

Look, I’m not saying I didn’t make a mistake by speaking when John was, but again, it was a large room full of people and we were all kind of doing our own thing. It was an honest mistake. And to have this person who I don’t report to in ANY way scold me in front of the whole room, my own boss staying silent, and then getting sent out basically, LOL! I’m not crazy right?

# Choosing The Right Coffee Beans

Flavored coffee is a delightful treat that can brighten your day. Making it at home is easy and allows for creativity. You can choose your favorite flavors and enjoy a personalized cup. [Let’s explore the steps to create your perfect flavored coffee.](https://gomehedi.com/best-flavored-coffee-beans/)

# ${example}

Finding the right coffee beans is the first step to great flavor. **Arabica beans** are popular for their sweet taste and smooth texture. **Robusta beans** offer a stronger and more bitter flavor. Choose beans based on your taste preference and desired flavor profile.

# Grind Size And Consistency

The grind size affects the coffee’s taste. **Coarse grind** is great for French press, while **medium grind** suits drip coffee makers. **Fine grind** works best for espresso machines. Consistent grind size ensures even extraction and a balanced flavor.

# Flavoring Options

* **Syrups**: Add vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut syrup for sweetness.
* **Spices**: Cinnamon, nutmeg, or cardamom can add warmth.
* **Extracts**: Use almond or peppermint extracts for a unique taste.
* **Natural Ingredients**: Consider cocoa powder or vanilla beans for a natural twist.

# Brewing Techniques

Different brewing methods bring out unique flavors. **French press** allows oils and flavors to blend well. **Espresso machines** extract rich and intense flavors. **Cold brew** creates a smooth and less acidic coffee. Choose a method that complements your flavor choice.

Which is a totally different question from should I do it? Which is my next question.  I guess I’m using this as more of a cathartic release and you guys are the best community to receive me. At this point my heart is ready to receive input whether positive or negative from other people, although I recognise that I am currently pretty defensive about this whole thing as I’ve developed an emotional urgency around it…but okay… here’s my story. 

I come from a fairly precarious country, we’re close to the poster child of worst business environment , especially for someone like myself who would struggle doing the type of businesses that do well , aptly described as hustling- I’m simply not built for it. 

But I’ve spent close to 14 months now toying with the idea of a coffee business, which surprisingly just doesn’t exist at the level I’m thinking of in our country. We do have cafes or rather restaurants that serve coffee but nothing in the realm of specialty coffee which prompted me to start buying and bringing my own coffees from around the world for myself. I decided to start “hustling” these coffee beans at some point and fell into the rabbit hole I’m in now.  With a problem to solve “How do I scale a coffee business in this country?”

There was curiosity from my immediate community , and I got quite a few regular buyers of my pantry beans. I decided to cast a wider net and hit good amount of curiosity in other cities mainly the capital.  But not directly converting curiosity. I realised if I wanted to sell beans enough to establish this as a business it needed scaffolding. I’m pretty aggressive when I have a problem to solve so I went deeper. I felt there was an education problem, so I used that as an incision point. I did a few talks (all I was invited to based on my online marketing) , teaching people my very intermediate knowledge around coffee and home brewing which wasn’t much but was exhilarating and I’d make a few sales of beans too but not enough to call my problem solved. I built a pretty good instagram community and it came with ample opportunity to learn social media and marketing and all that which has been really fun. This little hobby has also landed me in some crazy spaces, I’ve been invited to expos , conferences , large organisations all because the coffee brand I built online looks really good and I’ve put in a good amount of work behind it too.

We’re actually a coffee growing country but most of our beans end up in export barrels. I thought about doing that too, growing and exporting coffee and spoke to two brands that have managed to capture a pretty good market in Europe and the USA and got some really good insight from them , but I’m not super sold on that. I also asked them and some cafes what they needed from the coffee industry in our country and people spoke about the need of good roasting - they only get very dark badly roasted supply. But I’m not sure I’m the right person for that. I’ve done a lot of research into what that model looks like , visited roasters in neighbouring countries with stronger coffee cultures, and it’s an exciting space and one way to solve my problem that could be validated. There is one major competitor in this space , and a few lone roasters but with huge vulnerabilities in quality and marketing. They’ve depended on just being the default service providers for so long. 

My skills and successes though have been more consumer focused. I am a great people person, I love design and building spaces so I’m drawn more to opening a coffee shop- but not just any coffee shop - there’s a huge gap to open this country’s best franchise coffee shop. The competition is so low. Our one franchise is backed up serving food and meals that they barely serve coffee any more and do not innovate at all. 
I lived abroad for almost 15 years and had access to things like Starbucks and that’s even just Starbucks. I’ve lived in developing countries that have great local coffee chains whose environments are closer to ours and I’m seriously considering dumping my savings and life into this project. 

There’s a few key factors. 1. Is there a market ? Do people drink enough coffee? 
Answer: yes there’s a market. We have a huge diaspora community that returns all year long, I’ve spoken to several that identify a coffee chain as a need when they are here. I post my drinks online a lot and always get DMs of people asking where the cafe is located, I tell them then that I sell beans and gear and they aren’t at that level yet so they go cold. My assessment here is we’re still early in the second wave of coffee - my current offerings are too third wave. Serving simple drinks like caramel lattes , in plastic cups with people’s names on them is still a thing of wonder here.

Do people have disposable income ? A cup of plain coffee here goes for $3 , with local bean supply and dairy supply and eventual vertical integration - I think we can price match and upsell from that base. Plus people spend a lot of money in restaurants too , we have matcha shops, sushi spots that do well too. I think there’s a large enough market with disposable income to support a few locations especially if I keep it lean. Which I would do.

Am I prepared for the lows of business ? I totally understand this won’t be easy. Which is part of the fear. Business in itself is not hard , I’ve described the whole experience as though I’ve woken up in a falling plane and I just have to land this bird. There’s a lot of work to do , a lot of things to learn , I’m expecting really tough months - but I see it beyond that that I’m almost ready to do it. 

I’ve drafted an entire SOP manifesto, a business plan , lots of documenting my activities over the last year (I’m a researcher by profession) , and I think I’ve answered my question very thoroughly. I have a plan - my question is now can I pull it off and there’s nothing particularly special about me doing it, its been done before in other places but in this country it’s just the perfect time right now

What I feel right now is if I don’t do it in the next three years someone else will , and I’ll hate myself for it. 

Key barriers: I’m literally just a girl. I can save up the minimum amount to start a small format kiosk in the next few months but I’m scared, not because I think it’s a bad idea but just scared in general of doing it. It’s been a lonely thing , everyone is kinda looking at me crazy. I doubt myself too sometimes but if someone else does it after how much digging I’ve done- I’ll internally combust so yeah …",3,1748970899.0,coffeeshopowners,2,1.0,False

I sometimes attend a really fun non-denom church close to my home where everyone can wear whatever the hell they want. Plus, they serve coffee (off topic, but an added bonus!).

The problem is that my husband is still TBM, so I've kept my church clothes just in case, but it's annoying how much room they take up(also, I just realized I'm keeping them because I worry about members judging me based on what I'd wear if I had to attend). Don't get me wrong--I don't ever want to go back to mormon church. It's just not easy for me to get rid of clothes. Maybe realizing why I'm hanging onto them will help?

My personal style of dress has changed twice since leaving, which has been fun, but if I had to attend a mormon church function, then I would need something. But honestly, I can't listen to gencon without getting the creeps, and the last time I actually attended a sacrament meeting, I had two panic attacks at the thought of returning to church ever again. But because my husband's still active, I wonder if I should hang onto something--just in case.  

I guess if my husband ever left, then the first thing I would do would be to climb up into the attic and crawl to the furthest corner and get that huge bag of garments and temple clothes from where I chucked them 3 years ago and destroy them. Then I'd take a good look at my closet and probably just keep whatever I might wear to a local church if I wanted to wear a dress (but really, wearing shorts to church is so much fun!). Just answered my own question. Ha!",1,1748970742.0,exmormon,8,0.67,False

I will try to be as brief as I can to explain the whole context, but I need some advice.

I met this woman at work 1,5 years ago - we live very close to each other and we became friends. Our friendship developed very quick and naturally, we were hanging out together every week for over an year to coffees, restaurants, shopping, drinks, trips, walks, etc.

In this meantime she went through a divorce, and I was there all along. I followed her entire divorce process, being a shoulder and a companion when she needed. Eventually, she started meeting new guys, which I was always supportive because I thought she needed to live her life. 

Our friendship remained strong, I would meet her new dates, we would travel together (we visited 2 countries together), talk about our personal problems, etc. We never had a fight or an argument about anything. We would even tell each other we were best friends. 

An important detail from now on: I am a gay guy and she’s a straight woman, and she’s 5 years older than me. 

Around 3 months ago, she was seeing two different guys and was indecisive which of them she wanted to have a serious relationship with. So she started dating the first one (which I had met and liked him), but after a month, she found an excuse to dump him and started dating the other guy (that I haven’t met). And this is where the “problem” starts. 

After she started this second relationship (2 months ago), she became distant. Our weekly hangouts turned into zero. The only two times I saw her in these two months, it was me who called and invited her to do something - and it was both times a very quick thing, like have a coffee and bye. I decided that I would not invite her again - I would wait her to do it next time. It never happened. 

She is constantly posting on her social media that she’s hanging out with other straight friends (mainly straight couples) along with her new boyfriend. She sometimes sends me a text to ask for help on something that she needs but that’s all - no invitations for anything. 

Then, this last weekend, I went to a small city in Spain with my boyfriend (a cute city I have told her about the last time I saw her) and posted a story on my instagram. She saw it and messaged me saying that she would be going to the same place, on the same day, and was even staying in the same hotel as me - she, her boyfriend and a straight couple friends with them. 
Although we coincidentally were in the same city and hotel, we did not do anything together because they already had plans, and she didn’t invite me and my boyfriend for anything. 

It’s hard to admit, but I feel upset, ignored and left out. I think her new boyfriend might have a problem with LGBT people that she’s never told me about, and so she decided to be distant from me. 

To reinforce: we did not have a fight or argument, the last times I saw her she didn’t say anything about something that could be wrong, and she keeps reacting to my stories on Instagram like nothing happened. 

Am I overreacting? Should I say something? Should I just delete her from my socials and consider this friendship expired? Help!

If I buy a 12oz coffee and two 1oz shots, how many ounces of coffee should I be walking out the door with? 14 ounces, obviously. But... when you get extra shots in your drip coffee, they give you less drip to make room for the shots. Then, they leave room for cream which is even less drip coffee.

Would I be the a$$hole if I were to ask for 12oz of coffee in a 16oz cup so they don't have to short me any drip coffee? The custom mug I have actually has ""oz"" and ""ml"" measuring cup markers on the inside of it so you can see just how much liquid is in it.

If coffee wasn't such a ripoff, I wouldn't care so much. But it is, so I do. $1 for an extra shot? Some places even more!",0,1748970699.0,AITAH,18,0.25,False
1l2hhvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l2hhvw/who_should_plan_and_pay_for_dates_24f_and_27m/,Who should plan and pay for dates? 24F and 27M,"Is it weird that my new boyfriend always wants me to pay for myself and have me plan the majority our dates? 

I recently started dating this guys I really like. Background, I am coming from a 5 year relationship where the guy insisted on almost always paying for everything, including our bills. That relationship balanced in other ways where he communicated it felt equal and this was never a concern for us. I love to cook, clean, plan (and would chip in/pay for) trips, and help out in any way I can. Between that relationship and this one, every guy I went on a date with would not let me pay, even if I offered. They were eager to plan fun dates for us as well. 

My new boyfriend and I immediately hit it off and have become inseparable. We have a lot in common and both usually have a tough time connecting romantically/ emotionally so this was a big deal! He had been perusing a date for months until it finally happened and he has said I am what he’s been searching for his whole life, ect. He’s openly said he’s sure I am the one. 

This was not an issue until we had been hanging out for 3ish weeks and he had suggested grabbing one drink each at a bar and he was upset that I did not offer to cover the bill. It has been an issue since then. 

In addition, he has openly said he paid for almost everything with his exes because they made less than him which makes this more upsetting. 

I make around $75K a year and am 24 years old (Female) he makes 100k and is 27 years old (Male). I have been frugal and worked very hard to build some significant savings. I’m a trauma nurse at a large hospital. On the other hand, he has racked up some minor debts and is more extravagant with his spending and monthly expenses. He has a work from home IT job. 

Due to my savings and strict financial history, he says that’s why I should be more active with wanting to pay for myself and us. In addition, because he has more monthly expenses than I do. Because his exes were not like that, that’s why he didn’t push the same dynamic. I just feel like I’m being punished for being financially responsible. He makes about $2k a month more than I do after taxes. 

He doesn’t enjoy free activities (free live music, ect) because he prioritizes time over money and would rather pay for an activity he wants to do or grab dinner. I am the opposite and just enjoy spending time with the person. In turn, he has also vocalized that I should be planning more dates even though I feel as though he doesn’t plan them at all. He voices frustration that he has paid for our coffee, drinks, and a few of our dinner dates and wants me to send him half afterwards or cover it, even if I communicated that I am always happy to make dinner together/ cook to save some money. 

This is just a weird dynamic to me and I talked to one friend about it who is in a long term relationship and she seemed very concerned about the situation and that he was this frustrated about having to pay for me and plan our dates.

I said the green pill made me sleepy so this week since I start taking it daily, I was going to take it before bed. 

Yeah, it’s not worth it. I took the green pill Sunday night and took just my Bupropion yesterday (Monday) morning. Still ate a little less than I would’ve throughout the day before starting this kit, and had a little less food noise, but not near as well as when I would take the green pill in the morning, which makes sense. 

I wasn’t even really less sleepy so it wasn’t worth it to not help curb the appetite and quiet the food noise. Today, on Tuesday, I just took the 1/2 green pill and bupropion together this morning right before I ate breakfast. It’s helped with my appetite and food noise so much. I drank half a small coffee with it to help with the tiredness and that helped a lot too. 

My work provided a Cracker Barrel spread for lunch and I made a plate with a very small serving of a few things. I couldn’t finish it, which is what I need.

I wasn’t just tired I felt mentally empty. Every day felt like I was stuck in a loop of mindless scrolling, shallow dopamine hits, and zero motivation.

I’d wake up groggy, immediately check my phone, and scroll through apps until I realized I was already late for everything. I’d drink coffee just to ""start functioning,"" but even then, I was constantly unfocused jumping between tabs, skipping real meals, and procrastinating everything that actually mattered.

At night, I couldn’t sleep without a screen in front of me. I’d end up in a hole of random YouTube videos, TikToks, Instagram reels until 2–3 a.m. My sleep was garbage, my energy nonexistent, and I kept reaching for quick stimulation to feel something.

I tried dopamine detoxing the hard way quitting everything cold turkey. It worked for a day or two, then I’d fall right back into the cycle, but now with more guilt. I tried habit apps, 75 Hard, and even extreme routines, but nothing stuck.

What eventually worked wasn’t a dopamine fast it was a slow, intentional reset.

I started by turning off notifications and limiting how much short-form content I consumed. I set screen-off times before bed and started inserting short breathing pauses whenever I felt the urge to scroll. I also made an effort to go on daily walks, eat actual food (not just snacks and sugar), and stick to a consistent sleep schedule even if it wasn’t perfect.

But the most important shift was mental: I stopped trying to punish myself into change. I let go of the idea of being perfect and allowed myself to slip up, as long as I kept returning to the rhythm. I began tracking how I felt, not just what I avoided and that made a huge difference. Over time, the cravings weakened, my focus came back, and my mood became more stable. It wasn’t overnight, but it was real.

After all that, I ended up writing out a simple 30-day reset based on what helped me the most. Nothing extreme just small, doable changes that actually worked for me.

I remember the first morning I looked in the mirror and thought, “Hmm, I kinda like this.” It was one of those messy mornings when I was running late, hair doing its own thing, and I still had yesterday’s mascara smudged under my eyes. But something about the reflection made my heart flutter. Maybe it was the way my bright pink robe felt against my skin or the glimpse of confidence shining through my sleepy gaze. Sometimes I call myself a stylish, trendy young woman, though I wasn’t always ready to claim that label. When I was a kid, I used to sneak into my mom’s closet just to brush my fingers along the silky sleeves of her blouses, or I’d gently pull at a lavender dress she wore only on special occasions. I still remember the thrill of that forbidden curiosity, how every lace trim and pastel fabric whispered promises of a world that felt so much more like “me” than my baggy T-shirts and cargo pants ever did.

The first time I actually dressed myself in a full outfit that wasn’t “meant” for me was during college. I’d found a shimmering teal blouse at a vintage store downtown, and I literally squealed when I touched it. It was so soft and fluid, like water in fabric form. I pressed it to my body, imagining how it would drape over my shoulders and hug my waist. There was this sweet older lady at the checkout who gave me the smallest knowing smile when I purchased it. I felt a tingle of excitement that maybe, just maybe, she understood. I rushed home, locked my bedroom door, and slipped it on with a high-waisted skirt I’d ordered online a month prior. Standing in front of my mirror, I wiggled my hips slightly, letting the skirt swish around my legs. The sensation was intoxicating, dear. I whispered to my reflection, “Wow, this is... new,” because I honestly had no idea how to process that rush of liberation mingling with the jitters of stepping beyond what I’d always been taught was normal.

I was living in a shared apartment at that time, and it was complicated. One of my roommates was chill and open-minded, but the other—well, let’s just say he wasn’t exactly a champion of self-expression. I worried he’d barge in or snoop around, so I hid my new clothes behind old coats in my closet. At night, I’d sometimes tiptoe to the bathroom in my teal blouse and skirt, the lights off, just feeling the gentle sway of the fabric. My heart would pound whenever I heard a door creak somewhere else in the apartment. But the risk was worth it, dear, because every second spent in those clothes helped me realize I was feeling more “me” than I ever did in my standard attire. And that, in turn, gave me the courage to keep going.

There’s a special thrill in learning to do your own makeup for the first time. I spent way too many hours watching online tutorials, and let me tell you, I had zero natural talent for blending eyeshadow. Like, none at all. The first time I tried contouring, I somehow ended up with harsh lines that made me look more like I was doing theatre makeup. Still, the process was fun, especially because every brush stroke felt like a little step closer to presenting myself as I felt inside. Sometimes I’d hum my favorite pop songs while dabbing on foundation, or I'd giggle at how ridiculous I looked before everything was properly blended. But then, aha, I'd see the final result and quietly whisper, “OMG, I did it.” There’s this magical moment when the lip gloss goes on, tinted a soft pink or maybe a bold red. It’s like sealing the deal: Here I am, a fierce version of me that’s no longer just a daydream.

Of course, crossdressing isn’t all about the clothes and makeup. It’s about the way people look at you, and the way you interpret their gazes. The first time I ventured outside my apartment, my stomach was in knots. I tried to pick the perfect outfit: not too flashy, but not so bland that I’d feel invisible. I went with a snug pair of skinny jeans, a light floral blouse, and ankle boots with a tiny heel. I remember opening the door to the hallway, heart pounding, internally screaming, “You can do this, you can do this,” like some self-affirming mantra. And the moment I stepped out, I swear every molecule in my body was vibrating. I took the stairs instead of the elevator, convinced I’d run into a neighbor who’d stare or question me. But I somehow made it to the lobby without anyone popping up. The real test came when I strolled onto the sidewalk downtown. Cars whizzed by, people bustled around, and I kept smoothing my blouse, worried it was too obvious I wasn’t used to this. Then a random passerby gave me a polite nod, like you’d do for any stranger, and that tiny gesture felt monumental. I realized, dear, people are often so wrapped up in their own day they barely pay attention in the way we fear they do.

Not that everything went perfectly. When I went into a café to grab an iced coffee, the barista hesitated, looking me up and down. She flashed a kind of half-smile, maybe confusion, maybe politeness. I’m still not sure. My cheeks felt warm, and I wondered if my makeup was smudged or if my top was giving me away in some huge, glaring way. But she was nice, took my order, and spelled my name completely wrong on the cup. Typical. I found a seat in the corner, forced myself to sip calmly, and tried to quell the nerves fluttering in my stomach. I glanced around, expecting stares, but mostly people were buried in their laptops or phones. A couple of times, I caught someone’s eyes flicking my way, but nobody said a thing. That was when I realized real freedom doesn’t come from total acceptance by strangers; it comes from me being okay with what I’m doing, no matter how people react.

I didn’t come out to my friends right away. I guess I was afraid I’d be dismissed or ridiculed, and that fear made me keep this part of my life carefully tucked away. But eventually, I confided in my best friend, Tessa. She’s the kind of person who can smell a secret from a mile away, always prying in the warmest, friendliest way. One evening, when we were having our regular Netflix and pizza night, I casually said, “Hey, there's something I wanna show you.” Her eyebrows shot up, and she murmured, “Omg, what now?” I went into my room, changed into my favorite burgundy wrap dress, applied a little lipstick, and walked out. Her jaw dropped, and for a second, I couldn’t tell what she was thinking. Then she broke into the sweetest grin, squealed, “You look amazing, dear!” and pulled me into a massive hug. That acceptance from one of the closest people in my life felt like a thousand fireworks going off inside my chest. We ended up talking until dawn, discussing what crossdressing meant for me, how it wasn’t some silly hobby but a core part of how I wanted to present myself.

Tessa began helping me explore my style, and we spent entire afternoons rummaging through thrift shops, picking out floral dresses and stylish blazers that might work with different body shapes. She’d hold a garment up to my shoulders, tilt her head, and say, “Hmm, I’m not sure about this color on you, sweetie, but let’s see.” And we’d giggle ourselves silly in the changing rooms. I discovered I had a penchant for high-waisted skirts and light, flowy tops, while Tessa nudged me to try bold prints now and then. It was like a mini fashion revolution, and I loved every second. Over time, my closet became an eclectic mix of dresses, jeans, skirts, and blouses that fit me so much better—both physically and emotionally—than anything I’d worn before.

Yet with every step forward, there were moments that shook me. I vividly recall an awkward encounter at a department store. I was trying on a pair of heels—simple black pumps—when an older woman beside me raised her eyebrows in disapproval. She didn’t say anything, but her expression spoke volumes. My face burned, and I could feel a wave of insecurity creeping in. That old anxiety—what if I’m doing something wrong?—threatened to crush my newfound confidence. Tessa, ever the guardian angel, waltzed over, placed a hand on my shoulder, and said loudly, “They look absolutely fabulous on you, dear!” She shot the woman a friendly smile and guided me away. It wasn’t about causing a scene; it was about reminding me I had every right to be there, to try on those heels, and to exist as I am.

Little by little, I became bolder. Going outside in a wig that I'd styled to frame my face just right, experimenting with smoky eye makeup for a night out, or even just tossing on a casual sundress for a quick grocery run felt like new levels of freedom. But it was never a straight line upward. Sometimes I’d be all excited to dress up and then I’d catch a glimpse of doubt in the mirror—traces of masculine features I worried looked too “obvious,” or the fear that my voice might out me if I had to ask a salesperson for help. These moments were humbling. Crossdressing wasn’t just about wearing different clothes; it was about facing all the social conditioning that told me this wasn’t acceptable. Each time I overcame those jitters, I learned a little more about courage and self-love.

One day, Tessa and I planned a big night out at a trendy rooftop bar. I spent hours picking the perfect outfit: a sleek black jumpsuit with a cinched waist and a sparkly belt, paired with strappy heels that made me feel like a runway queen—if a somewhat wobbly one, because walking in heels was still a challenge. I did my makeup meticulously, going for a golden eyeshadow to complement the city lights. Standing in front of the bathroom mirror, I felt this rush of anticipation. I whispered, “You’ve got this,” under my breath, and even though my voice was shaky, I meant it. Tessa and I hopped into a cab, and I tried to ignore the driver’s inquisitive glance in the rearview mirror. By the time we arrived at the bar, my heartbeat was practically a drum solo in my chest.

When we stepped inside, colored lights danced along the walls, and a wave of conversations, laughter, and music enveloped us. I was so nervous, dear, I could barely walk straight. Tessa looped her arm through mine, guiding me toward a table by the window. We ordered fancy cocktails, the kind with little umbrellas, and I did my best to relax. In that vibrant atmosphere, I realized that people came in all varieties. Groups of friends chatting animatedly, couples sharing discreet kisses, and individuals like me, each with their own stories swirling beneath the surface. A few turned their heads our way, but nobody pointed or whispered. I let out a breath I didn’t even know I’d been holding.

That night turned magical when a small group at a nearby table struck up conversation with us. They complimented my outfit, asked about where I got my belt, and we ended up talking about everything from the latest music trends to travel dreams. I waited for some sort of awkward revelation where they’d question my identity, but that moment never came. Instead, one of them even mentioned how they had a cousin who loved to blur fashion lines, and they thought it was inspiring. I could have cried from happiness. When we took a selfie together, I felt so incredibly alive, as though I was finally living the life I wanted rather than hiding in the shadows.

Of course, I still had family matters to deal with. My parents lived in another city, and I only visited them a couple of times a year. The last time I went home, I wrestled with whether I should reveal this side of myself. After all, it wasn’t just “a side.” It was me. During that visit, I decided to tell my mom first. Sitting in her cozy kitchen, the smell of her homemade cookies drifting around us, I said, “Mom, there’s something I need to share.” My voice trembled. She turned off the oven, giving me her full attention. I explained, carefully, that I’d been exploring crossdressing for a while, that it made me feel more at peace and more true to myself. I watched her expression shift from confusion to concern, then to something that looked a bit like acceptance. She asked me gentle questions about what it meant to me. I showed her photos on my phone, times I’d dressed up for different events, and I held my breath, not sure how she’d react.

Eventually, she reached out and placed her hand on mine. “I love you,” she said. “I’m still trying to understand, but I do love you.” Those words, dear, they were everything. I think she needed time to process, but she didn’t shut me out or condemn me. My dad was a bit more reserved. He gave a half-hearted nod when I brought it up, like, “Okay, if that’s what you want to do.” I could sense his hesitation. But I left that day feeling hopeful. Not everyone will throw a parade for you, but sometimes a neutral stance is a stepping stone to deeper acceptance later. At least that’s what I tried to tell myself.

After I returned to the city, a surge of confidence hit me. I felt lighter, like a weight had been lifted. I started telling more friends about my crossdressing, sometimes casually dropping it into conversation. I even posted a discreet photo on social media. Not a full reveal, but a cute picture of me in a chic off-shoulder top, hair styled, with a playful caption referencing being bold. The comments were mostly supportive. A few random acquaintances seemed surprised, maybe even weirded out, but overall, it felt liberating to not hide so much.

Everything escalated in the best way when Tessa decided to throw a small party in her newly renovated apartment and asked if I’d be comfortable dressing how I wanted around a slightly bigger group of friends. I hesitated for a moment, but she assured me it would be a supportive environment. So I did it. I wore a red wrap dress with a delicate necklace, did my nails a sparkly silver, and put on my best winged eyeliner. When I walked into the party, the mood was warm and welcoming. One of Tessa’s friends complimented my shoes, another admired my lip color, and before I knew it, we were all dancing and laughing. It was a sweet kind of validation, a glimpse of what life could be like if I didn’t cloak myself in fear all the time.

Still, even in the midst of all that acceptance, there were complicated moments. A friend of a friend made some offhand joke that stung, something about “trying too hard to be a girl.” I froze for a second, tears threatening to well up, but Tessa’s glare shut him down, and later he apologized, stumbling over his words about not meaning to offend. It was a reminder that prejudice can lurk in well-intentioned spaces, but also that some people can learn and grow if we give them the chance.

I kept going out, refining my style, embracing the softness of satin or the playful swirl of a flared skirt. I loved how makeup became second nature, an art form that turned my face into a canvas of possibility. There was a night I spent hours just practicing winged eyeliner till my hand cramped, and I discovered a sense of calm in that repetitive motion—brush to eyelid, trace, fill, step back, evaluate. The mesmerizing feeling of seeing my features transform into something that aligned more with how I felt. If I messed up, I’d simply wipe it away and start over. It felt like a metaphor for life, dear: you’re always allowed to try again.

One of my proudest moments was attending an actual fashion event downtown, wearing a pastel pantsuit that blurred the lines of traditional gender norms. I matched it with a simple blouse that had a lace collar, and I was on cloud nine walking among creative folks, many of whom wore avant-garde outfits. People snapped pictures, praised each other’s ensembles, and asked me about my style. I introduced myself as the person I saw in my heart, not the one pinned to some outdated notion of “you can’t wear that.” It was a small crowd, mostly artistic and progressive, but it felt huge to me. Like I was truly part of a community that valued expression over conformity.

Over time, crossdressing became less of a special occasion thing and more woven into my everyday life. If I wanted to slip into a denim skirt to run errands, I did it. If I wanted to wear a soft tunic and leggings for a lazy Sunday, that’s exactly what I did. There were days I’d go for a more androgynous look—just some mascara, a sleek jacket, and fitted jeans—because variety is the spice of life, dear. I realized that expressing my feminine side didn’t negate anything else about me; it simply enriched it. And the best part was the quiet sense of joy I felt each morning when picking out an outfit that truly reflected my inner mood.

One weekend, I decided to go visit my parents again, this time without hiding. I packed my favorite outfits and even brought along a couple of new dresses I thought my mom might appreciate. I won’t lie, my hands shook a little when I walked through the door wearing a casual lilac blouse and skinny jeans that definitely highlighted my figure. My dad’s eyes darted down to my jeans, but he just said, “It’s good to see you.” My mom gave me a tentative smile. I could sense they were still adjusting, but at least they weren’t shutting me out. Over dinner, conversation flowed more easily than I anticipated. My mom asked me about my favorite shops, my dad inquired if I was safe when I went out, and I tried to reassure them that I was both cautious and confident. It was surreal, but in a good way, dear, seeing them grapple with their own expectations and still managing to care for me as their child.

Now, each day I wake up, I get to decide what I wear without letting fear choke me. Sure, I have moments of doubt, especially in unfamiliar places or around strangers who might not be kind. But I learned that carrying myself with confidence, or at least faking it until it becomes real, can be incredibly powerful. If someone sneers or snickers, that says more about them than it does about me. I’m done letting other people’s stares dictate who I am. I know not everyone will understand, and that’s okay. What matters is that I understand. That acceptance, that love for the person I see in the mirror, is what keeps me going.

Even at work, I’ve started testing the waters. On casual Fridays, I might wear a fitted top that leans more feminine, or maybe subtle earrings. Coworkers notice, but mostly they just ask, “Oh, new style?” and move on with their day. A few have shown real curiosity, and while I don’t overshare with everyone, I’ve learned who’s safe to open up to. One close colleague told me I inspired them to experiment with color and break out of their all-gray suits. It’s funny how authenticity can encourage others, even if their journey isn’t about crossdressing specifically. We each have our own ways of breaking the molds we feel trapped in.

Looking back, I’m amazed at how far I’ve come. The nervous person who tiptoed around in a teal blouse behind closed doors feels like a distant memory. Sometimes I’ll catch a glimpse of that old fear lurking, but I remind myself of all the small triumphs along the way: Tessa’s unwavering support, the kind strangers who complimented my fashion sense, the nights out where I actually felt like I belonged, and even my parents’ cautious but tangible steps toward acceptance. Crossdressing isn’t just a hobby or a quirk; it’s a significant part of my identity, shaping how I interact with the world and how I see myself.

I never thought I’d reach a point where I could casually walk into a clothing store and openly browse the dresses and skirts, discussing sizes with a sales associate as though it’s the most normal thing in the universe. But here I am, dear, flipping through hangers of floral prints and polka dots, trying to decide which pattern matches my mood. I love the gentle swish of a skirt against my legs, the feeling of lip gloss smoothing over my lips, the subtle click of heels on a hardwood floor. Those details might sound silly to some, but to me, they’re tiny miracles.

Every now and then, I reflect on how crossdressing opened a door I never knew I needed to walk through. It’s given me confidence, empathy for others who feel misunderstood, and a sense of style that makes me grin whenever I check my outfit in a shop window’s reflection. Sure, there have been bumps and bruises along the way, but isn’t that how growth works, dear? We learn by stepping out of our comfort zone, by challenging the boundaries we once accepted as unbreakable.

So that’s my journey. It’s ongoing, and I’m sure there’ll be new twists around the corner—maybe more family conversations, new friendships sparked over a mutual love of kitten heels, or more nights out where I dance under neon lights without a care. I’m excited to discover what comes next, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come. After all, the person I see in the mirror each morning—sometimes with messy bedhead, sometimes all glammed up—is still me. The clothes, the makeup, the style... they’re just reflections of the person who finally found the courage to say, “This is who I am, and I love it.” And that, dear, is the most genuine truth I’ve ever known.

“Today I will tell you how a red dress changed everything…”

 I didn’t plan to wear it.

I swear I didn’t.

 This all started on a rainy Sunday, the kind where the hours stretch thin and quiet. My wife was out visiting her sister. I stayed behind, pretending I needed the rest — but really, I just wanted to be alone. Not for anything specific… just to breathe without being watched.

 

I was folding the laundry she’d left half-finished on our bed. Her clothes. Delicate things. Smooth cotton tanks, silky panties, soft lace bras still warm from the dryer. I should’ve stopped right there — but I didn’t.

 

One piece was different. A red dress I hadn’t seen before. New. The tag still half-attached. It was short, fitted, with a soft shimmer. A little too bold for her usual style. Something she might wear… for someone else. That thought stuck like a thorn.

 

I held it up, just to look. Just to imagine. Then I brushed the fabric against my arm — and froze. It felt… expensive. Almost like water sliding over skin.

 

I don’t know what possessed me, but suddenly I was stepping out of my clothes. Heart pounding. Curtains drawn. I lifted the dress, slowly, and pulled it over my bare chest.

 

crossdressing story, I told myself in my head — like if I could name it, it would feel less real.

 

The zipper slid up my back with a quiet, sinful sound.

 

It hugged me in ways I didn’t expect. Tighter in the chest, looser in the waist, but it still fit. My breath got shallow. I couldn’t believe what I saw in the mirror. My arms looked slimmer. My stomach flatter. My thighs… softer somehow. And the hem—God, the hem—kissed my upper thighs like it belonged there.

 

I was someone else.

 

And then…

I heard the key turn in the front door.

 

She was home.

 

My blood ran cold. I couldn’t breathe. I scrambled to unzip the dress, but my fingers wouldn’t work. I fumbled, twisted, pulled. It was stuck.

 

I could hear her footsteps now. Calm. Familiar.

 

I finally yanked the dress off and threw it behind the bed. I grabbed a hoodie and jeans from the floor and pulled them on with trembling hands.

 

She opened the bedroom door before I could catch my breath.

 

She didn’t say anything at first. Just looked. Her eyes moved from my face… to the open closet… to the little red dress draped over the corner of the mattress like it had just woken up from a dream.

 

She raised an eyebrow.

 

And then…

 

She said something I’ll never forget.

 

“You should’ve tried the black one first. It would’ve looked better on your skin.”

 

And she smiled.

 

She didn’t raise her voice.

She didn’t accuse me.

She didn’t even look surprised.

 

Just… calm. Like she’d already played this moment out in her head. Like she had known something before I did.

 

I stood there awkwardly, half-zipped hoodie clinging to my chest, jeans loose because I hadn’t buttoned them properly. I felt like a child pretending to be invisible. But her eyes were sharp. Patient. Dissecting.

 

She walked over to the bed and gently picked up the red dress. It was wrinkled now. I had dropped it in such a panic that one of the sleeves was inside out.

 

She smoothed the fabric with her hand, her fingers slow and deliberate, like she was calming it. Then she looked at me again — not directly, but through the mirror.

 

“You like how it feels?” she asked, still adjusting the hem.

 

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. My throat was tight. My ears were ringing.

 

She turned slightly, still holding the dress by the shoulders, letting it hang down. “You looked in the mirror. Didn’t you?”

 

I swallowed hard. “I—I didn’t mean to… I just—”

 

“It’s okay,” she said, cutting me off gently.

 

Her voice was soft but steady, like she was talking someone down from a ledge.

 

“I don’t care that you tried it on. I care that you didn’t tell me.” She paused. “That you felt like you had to hide it.”

 

I looked down. My hands were clenched into fists, deep in the hoodie pocket. My knuckles hurt.

 

“I was just curious,” I mumbled. “It didn’t mean anything.”

 

She raised an eyebrow again. “Didn’t it?”

 

I didn’t answer.

 

She walked to the closet and hung the dress back up, carefully, like she was tucking a memory away on a hanger. When she turned back, her face had changed — a little colder, maybe. Or maybe just more serious.

 

“You ever worn heels?” she asked suddenly.

 

It felt like a slap. Not harsh — just unexpected. I blinked at her.

 

“No,” I whispered.

 

She tilted her head. “Would you want to?”

 

“I… don’t know.”

 

She walked past me, casually, like the moment wasn’t balancing everything between us. Like this wasn’t a marriage teetering on something we didn’t have a name for.

 

But before she left the room, she stopped in the doorway and turned.

 

“There’s a pair in the hall closet,” she said. “Black ones. Low heel. Not too hard to walk in. Just… if you want to try again.”

 

Then she left.

 

And I stood there — still in my half-buttoned jeans, still wrapped in a hoodie that didn’t feel like it belonged to me anymore — with my ears burning and my heart pounding.

 

I didn’t know what had just happened.

 

But I knew it hadn’t been rejection.

 

It was something else.

 

Something stranger.

And somehow scarier. The shoes were where she said they'd be.

 

Back of the hallway closet. Tucked in a clear plastic box, behind old photo albums and a rolled-up yoga mat she hadn’t touched in months. I stared at them for a long time before I picked them up.

 

They weren’t flashy. Black patent leather, rounded toe, maybe two-inch heel. Scuffed a little near the sides — not new, not special. Just ordinary women’s shoes. The kind you wear when you want to be put together, but not noticed.

 

I sat down on the edge of the bed, shoes in my lap, fingers tracing the arch of the sole. I kept expecting to feel shame — heavy, burning, moral shame. But what I felt instead was nervous. Tender. Like I was reaching for something I didn’t quite understand.

 

I took off my socks. My feet looked pale and bony in the dim bedroom light. The carpet felt colder than usual.

 

I slipped my toes into the left shoe first. Then the right.

 

It was snug, but it fit.

 

I stood slowly, testing the balance.

 

Everything shifted. My weight moved forward, my legs adjusted, my calves tightened. I caught my reflection in the mirror across the room — tall, a little awkward, hoodie still draped over my chest — but different. The heels added something. A shape. A posture. A quiet suggestion.

 

I took one careful step. Then another.

 

And another.

 

The sound of the heels clicking on the hardwood floor was soft but deliberate. Unmistakable. Feminine. Foreign. Familiar. All at once.

 

I felt ridiculous.

I felt amazing.

 

Then I heard her voice from the kitchen.

 

“Take smaller steps,” she said. “And lead from the hips.”

 

I froze.

 

She had been watching. Again.

 

I wanted the floor to swallow me. I wanted to run. But I didn’t move. I just stood there, in my wife’s heels, legs trembling slightly, hands hanging awkwardly at my sides.

 

She appeared in the doorway a moment later, holding her coffee mug. Her face was unreadable.

 

“You’re not bad,” she said. “A little stiff, but that’s normal. Walking feminine’s all in the sway. Let the clothes move with you.”

 

I didn’t know what to say. I just looked at her, waiting for the blow that still hadn’t come.

 

Instead, she walked toward me — not close, just enough to see me clearly — and tilted her head.

 

“You want to try again?”

 

She didn’t say, Are you okay?

She didn’t say, Why are you doing this?

She didn’t say, Stop.

 

She just waited.

 

I looked down at my feet. Then at her.

 

And I nodded.

 

She didn’t rush me. That’s what I remember most.

 

She just stood there, sipping her coffee like we were talking about weekend plans. Like I wasn’t standing in the middle of our hallway, barefoot inside her heels, trying not to fall apart.

 

“Try again,” she said gently. “From the start of the hallway. Come toward me.”

 

My heart pounded. Not from the heels. Not from the embarrassment. From something deeper. A kind of fear that maybe I wanted this too much. That once I started, I wouldn’t be able to stop.

 

I turned around, slowly, and took my place at the far end of the hall.

 

I took one step.

 

Then another.

 

The heels made a quiet, padded click against the wooden floor. My steps were shorter now, more deliberate. I tried to relax my knees, to roll from heel to toe like I remembered seeing in her movements.

 

“Better,” she said. “Looser in the hips.”

 

I adjusted. Hips swaying just slightly, almost like the movement was coming from the dress I wasn’t wearing.

 

“Think about letting your shoulders drop. Not slouched—just softer. Less tension.”

 

I exhaled. Shoulders lowered. Chest open.

 

She was coaching me like it was nothing. Like this was a totally normal thing for a husband to be doing on a Thursday morning.

 

I reached her at the end of the hallway, unsure what to do with my hands.

 

She looked me up and down. Not with lust. Not with pity.

 

Just… curiosity.

 

“I know it probably feels stupid,” she said. “But you’re learning. This stuff—how we carry ourselves—it’s learned. It’s in the details.”

 

I nodded, throat dry.

 

She hesitated, then added, “When I was twelve, my aunt made me walk in heels around the living room for hours. She said if I was going to wear them in public, I needed to wear them in private first. So I get it.”

 

I smiled, barely. “I guess I skipped that part.”

 

“Not too late.”

 

I looked down at my legs. They looked different in heels. More shaped. More exposed. I wasn’t wearing anything feminine besides the shoes, but I still felt… seen. Like something underneath the surface was peeking out, daring to stretch.

 

She turned away, heading back toward the kitchen.

 

But as she walked, she said without turning her head:

 

“There’s a box under the bed. Some older stuff. Clothes I don’t wear anymore. I was going to give it away.”

 

She paused in the doorway.

 

“You can look through it, if you want.”

 

Then she disappeared around the corner, and I was alone again — still standing there in her heels, still trembling.

 

Still wondering what part of me I’d just opened.

 

The shoes came off first.

 

I stepped out of them slowly, one hand braced against the wall. My feet ached in a way I’d never felt before—sharp along the arches, strangely satisfying in the calves. I curled my toes into the carpet and sat down on the edge of the bed, heart still thumping like it didn’t know what had just happened.

 

She hadn’t told me to stop.

She hadn’t even seemed surprised.

She told me there was a box.

 

I dropped to my knees.

 

I reached under the bed.

 

There it was—one of those folded cardboard wardrobe boxes, taped neatly along the edges. Dusty, but not untouched. It had been opened before. Probably more than once.

 

I pulled it out slowly, every inch making a soft rustling sound like the box itself was unsure it wanted to be found.

 

When I peeled back the flaps, the smell hit me. Faint perfume. Fabric softener. Maybe a little cedar from the closet. Familiar. Feminine. Warm.

 

Inside were clothes. Folded and layered.

 

Soft knits. Stretchy camis. Slips, old skirts, tights with faded waistbands. A few bras — mostly bralettes, lightly padded, some frayed with wear. And panties. So many panties. All kinds — cotton, lace, boyshorts, satin.

 

My fingers hovered above them like they might bite.

 

I shouldn’t.

I knew I shouldn’t.

But I did.

 

I pulled out a pale lavender pair. Thinner than anything I’d ever worn. Trimmed with soft lace along the edges. The label was faded, but I could still read the size.

 

I swallowed hard. And stood.

 

I undressed quickly. My jeans, hoodie, boxers—tossed onto the chair like they didn’t belong to me. Maybe they didn’t.

 

The lavender panties slid up my legs like a secret being told for the first time. Cool at first. Then warm.

 

Stretchy. Tight in just the right places. They didn’t hide anything, not really. But they made it all feel… controlled. Framed. Smaller.

 

I stood there in nothing but those panties, staring into the mirror.

 

I didn’t know what I was looking for. I just knew I couldn’t stop.

 

Then I heard her voice again, just behind me. She had come back, silent as a thought.

 

“You picked those?”

 

I spun. “I— I didn’t mean—”

 

“It’s okay,” she said. And this time, her tone was different. Not amused. Not teasing.

 

Tender.

 

She stepped forward and sat on the edge of the bed, hands resting on her knees. “Those were one of my first pairs. I bought them when I was maybe twenty-two. Still figuring out what I liked. They were cheap, but I liked the way they made me feel.”

 

I looked down, embarrassed. “I shouldn’t have.”

 

“No,” she said softly. “I told you to look. That means I wanted you to.”

 

There was a long silence.

 

Then she added, “Do they feel… good?”

 

I nodded.

 

Her eyes held mine for a moment. Not judgmental. Not cold.

 

Then she stood, and as she walked past me to the door, she placed one hand briefly on my back.

 

“Next time, try them with a skirt,” she whispered.

 

And then she was gone.

 

Again.

 

Leaving me there—half naked, half alive, fully seen.

 

I didn’t touch the box for two days.

 

It just sat there in the corner of the room, open like a secret I didn’t know how to shut again. Every time I walked past it, my eyes dropped to the lavender panties lying on top. They were folded neatly now. She had done that. After I changed and slipped back into old clothes, she hadn’t said anything. She’d just quietly picked them up, folded them, and placed them back in the box.

 

Like they were mine now.

Like she was waiting.

 

On the third night, I gave in.

 

I waited until she was asleep. Her slow breathing from the other side of the bed gave me permission. Or maybe it gave me cover. I moved as quietly as I could, heart pounding like I was breaking into my own life.

 

The panties slid up easier this time.

 

Like my body remembered them.

 

I picked through the rest of the box slowly, fingertips grazing each item like I was asking them for permission. Most of the skirts were simple. A navy blue one caught my eye — short, but not too short. Soft cotton with a hidden zipper. Lined on the inside. I held it against my hip and looked in the mirror.

 

It looked like it might fit.

 

I stepped into it.

 

Pulled it up. Zipped it with both hands, trying not to breathe.

 

It hugged me snug at the waist, flared slightly over my thighs. The panties underneath felt different now — more complete somehow, like they belonged in layers.

 

I didn’t put on anything else. No top. No bra. I just stood there in her — my — panties and skirt. The air against my bare chest felt sharp and intimate. Every movement of the skirt made me aware of how it touched me, how it swayed against the backs of my legs.

 

I walked to the mirror. Slowly.

 

I didn’t recognize myself. Not exactly. But I didn’t hate the reflection.

 

It felt more real than I wanted it to.

 

A part of me — the part I usually kept locked away — whispered, this could be you. Not forever. Not all the time. But in moments. In private. In softness.

 

Then I heard the bedsheets shift.

 

I turned. She was sitting up. Awake. Eyes on me.

 

I froze.

 

She didn’t blink. Just looked.

 

Then, quietly, she said, “That one suits you.”

 

I didn’t move. Couldn’t speak.

 

She pushed the covers aside and walked toward me. Her steps were slow. Careful. She stood behind me in the mirror, watching our reflections together. She was still in her sleep shirt. Bare legs. Hair messy.

 

“You have good instincts,” she whispered. “You just need shaping.”

 

Her hands moved to my hips, adjusting the waistband slightly. “Turn your feet out a little. There. Better.”

 

I felt her breath against my neck.

 

Then she did something I wasn’t ready for.

 

She reached into the box, pulled out a training bra — pale pink, almost childish — and held it up.

 

“This one’s soft,” she said. “Easy to start with. Want to try?”

 

I nodded.

 

She stepped around in front of me, gently lifting it over my arms, guiding it around my back. She fastened it without asking.

 

It didn’t fit tightly. It didn’t need to.

 

What it gave me was something I hadn’t expected:

 

Shape. Softness. Restraint.

 

And for the first time…

Safety.

 

She looked at me again in the mirror, her fingers still resting on my shoulders.

 

Then she said, “We’ll find you a better mirror.”

 

And she kissed my cheek like it was the most normal thing in the world. We didn’t talk about it the next morning.

 

She made coffee. I made toast. We moved around each other like we always did — quiet, practiced, familiar. But something had shifted. The air between us felt warmer. Less careful.

 

She didn’t bring it up.

Neither did I.

But I felt it.

 

Every movement, every glance, every time her hand brushed past mine while reaching for the sugar — it all said I saw you. I still see you.

 

The box stayed in the room. Open. Waiting.

 

That evening, she was working late on her laptop, half a dozen photos open on her screen from an old product shoot — her boutique, which she ran mostly online. Vintage resale. Handmade knits. Occasionally lingerie.

 

I was halfway through a beer when she spoke without looking up.

 

“Can you do me a favor?”

 

I looked over. “Sure.”

 

She clicked twice, then turned the screen toward me.

 

“This set needs new product photos,” she said, nodding to a pair of black lace panties and a soft mesh bralette. “Modeled. Real body. You don’t have to show your face.”

 

I blinked.

 

The silence stretched too long.

 

“You mean… me?” I asked.

 

She shrugged, like it wasn’t a big deal. “You don’t have to. I just know how it fits on you now. And it’ll sell better if people see that.”

 

My throat felt dry.

 

She reached behind her, picked up the set from a small box beside her desk, and laid it gently on the couch between us. The panties were delicate. Thin. See-through in places. The bralette looked like it might dissolve in a warm breeze.

 

She added softly, “You can say no.”

 

I looked down at the lace in my lap. It was beautiful. Intimate. Intimidating.

 

“I don’t think I’m ready for that,” I said.

 

She nodded. No pressure. Just acceptance.

 

But I didn’t hand the lingerie back.

 

Instead, I said, “Do I need to shave?”

 

She smiled.

 

The bathroom light was too bright. Every flaw on my body felt amplified. I took the razor and worked slowly, carefully — legs, arms, chest. I nicked myself more than once. I wasn’t used to these angles, this patience.

 

The bralette slid on easier than I expected. It felt like a whisper. Like permission. It didn’t push or squeeze. It just… held.

 

The panties were something else.

 

They clung.

 

They didn’t hide. They didn’t try. They just wrapped around me like they knew what they were doing — even if I didn’t.

 

I stepped out of the bathroom and saw her setting up the light ring. Her camera was already mounted on the tripod. She looked up, and for the first time, she stared.

 

Not in judgment. Not even surprise.

 

Just… seeing.

 

“You look… right,” she said.

 

I tried to laugh. “Right?”

 

“Yeah,” she said softly. “Like the lace was made for you.”

 

I swallowed.

 

Then she pointed to the wall. “Go stand there. We’ll start simple. Just three photos. Front. Side. Back.”

 

I obeyed.

 

The camera clicked.

 

I didn’t smile. I didn’t pose.

 

I just stood there, barely breathing.

 

Click.

 

Click.

 

Click.

 

And after the third one, I turned my head slightly and said, without even thinking:

 

“Do I look like a woman?”

 

She didn’t answer for a moment.

 

Then she stepped closer and adjusted the strap on my shoulder.

 

“No,” she whispered. “You look like you.”

 

And I almost cried. The photos turned out better than I could’ve imagined.

 

Too good.

 

I saw them on her laptop the next morning. She hadn’t hidden them. They were still open in her editing program, side by side — the three images we took: front, side, back.

 

My face wasn’t in them. But it didn’t matter.

 

The person in those pictures didn’t look like me.

And somehow… they did.

 

The lace framed my hips in a way that felt intentional, almost soft. The training bra — which I’d expected to look ridiculous — actually gave shape. Suggestion. The lighting hit my skin in just the right way, hiding what needed hiding, revealing what felt… delicate.

 

I didn’t feel disgusted.

I didn’t feel aroused.

I felt confused. And beautiful. And very, very quiet inside.

 

She walked into the room while I was still staring at the screen.

 

“Too much?” she asked gently.

 

I didn’t answer. I didn’t trust my voice.

 

She stepped behind me and rested her chin lightly on my shoulder, eyes locked on the screen like mine.

 

“You know,” she said softly, “you don’t have to figure it out all at once.”

 

“I don’t know what this is,” I whispered.

 

“I don’t either,” she replied. “But it doesn’t feel fake. That counts for something.”

 

I swallowed hard. My throat ached like I’d been holding something in for too long.

 

She kissed the side of my neck — barely — and pulled back.

 

“Try something,” she said.

 

I looked at her, confused.

 

“Go put it on again,” she said. “But not for the camera this time. Just for you.”

 

I hesitated.

 

“And this time,” she added, “don’t look in the mirror until you're dressed. Fully dressed. Pick what feels right.”

 

She left the room. No more instructions. No pressure. Just trust.

 

It took me ten minutes. Maybe more.

 

I chose a navy-blue pencil skirt. It zipped up like it had always been mine. Then a soft ivory blouse with lace at the sleeves. I padded my chest lightly — no real breast forms, just folded fabric — and smoothed the bralette over them. Panties, of course. Always the panties now.

 

When I finally turned toward the mirror, I froze.

 

There I was.

 

Someone new.

And yet someone I’d always known.

 

My hands trembled. My knees ached slightly from standing still so long.

 

And just as the first tears touched the edge of my vision, I heard her behind me, quiet as ever.

 

“You okay?”

 

“I… don’t know who I am.”

 

She stepped forward and wrapped her arms around my waist from behind. Her touch was firm but gentle, grounding.

 

“You’re mine,” she whispered into my hair.

 

I closed my eyes. And for a moment… I let myself believe her. We never called it “modeling” anymore.

 

Not out loud, anyway. Not after the photos went up.

 

It started small. Just a few soft pieces — bralettes, skirts, one floral slip. No face, just body shots. Carefully cropped. Posed but not pornographic. Feminine but not overt.

 

But people noticed.

 

Her inbox started filling up with comments. Messages. Orders.

 

“Who’s the new model?”

“I love how natural the fit looks.”

“Can we see more of her?”

 

Her.

 

She never corrected them. Neither did I.

 

We never said he or husband. Just she. Model. Our fit girl.

And strangely… it started to feel true.

 

I should have been terrified. I was, at times. But something about being seen — anonymously, quietly, even admired — created a strange kind of peace.

 

Some nights I’d sit on the edge of the bed, still dressed from a shoot. Skirt hugging my hips. Stockings warm against my thighs. A silky cami brushing my chest like breath.

 

I wouldn’t take it off right away.

 

She’d walk in, pause, and smile. “You forget to change?”

 

“No,” I’d say quietly.

 

She never pushed. She just sat beside me and picked at threads on the hem of my skirt. Sometimes she’d talk about sales numbers. Sometimes she’d say nothing at all.

 

But once — just once — she said, “You’re really helping me, you know.”

 

I turned to her, confused.

 

“I mean it,” she said. “The business. It’s growing. But also… you’re more open. Softer. You feel easier to be around.”

 

I looked away.

 

“It’s not that I wanted this,” she added. “I didn’t plan it. But now that it’s here… it feels like we’re closer.”

 

I nodded, but something in me twisted.

 

Because part of me wondered if that closeness came with a price.

 

I wasn’t her husband anymore. Not in this space. Not in this skin.

I was a figure in soft lighting. A shape in lace.

 

And sometimes…

I liked it.

 

I liked being her.

Even if I didn’t fully know who she was yet.

 

And then there were nights I hated how much I liked it. Nights when I’d unzip a dress and feel something inside me drop — like I’d lost something again. Something important I couldn’t name.

 

Once, after a long shoot, I didn’t bother changing.

 

I sat on the couch, knees crossed, sipping wine in a plum satin blouse and high-waisted pants that clung in all the right places. I hadn’t even removed the padded bra.

 

She sat across from me, looking tired but content. She swirled her glass and said, “You’re getting good at this.”

 

“At what?”

 

She smiled over the rim of her wineglass.

 

And didn’t answer.

 

It happened quietly.

 

No ceremony. No conversation. No decision.

 

Just… one small envelope in my sock drawer.

 

I found it on a Wednesday. We weren’t speaking much that morning. Not out of tension — just life. Emails. Grocery lists. The slow weight of routine.

 

I opened it while folding laundry.

 

Inside was a necklace. Gold. Thin. Simple.

 

And hanging from the chain, in soft cursive script, was a name:

 

Chloe.

 

No card. No note.

 

Just that.

 

I held it in my palm for a long time. It was warm from the sun coming through the window. The name glinted like it already knew it belonged to me.

 

She walked into the room a few minutes later, holding her coffee with both hands like she always did when she didn’t want to seem nervous.

 

“You found it,” she said.

 

I didn’t look up. I couldn’t.

 

“You picked a name,” I said quietly.

 

“You didn’t like ‘Jack’ anymore.”

 

“That’s not true.”

 

“Isn’t it?”

 

I finally looked at her. Her expression wasn’t smug. Not satisfied. Just… searching. Like she was trying to read my face for something I hadn’t written yet.

 

“What if I don’t want to be Chloe?” I asked, barely above a whisper.

 

She paused. “Then don’t be.”

 

I waited for more. But she didn’t offer it.

 

She turned and left the room, leaving me sitting on the edge of the bed with a necklace wrapped around my fingers and a stomach full of something I didn’t have language for.

 

That night, I didn’t wear the necklace.

 

I placed it carefully on the vanity, beside my hairbrush and a pale-pink lip balm I still pretended wasn’t mine.

 

But I couldn’t stop looking at it.

 

I didn’t wear it the next day either. Or the day after that.

 

But I thought about it.

 

I thought about the way she had whispered, You’re mine.

 

I thought about the click of heels in the hallway, the weight of soft fabric, the first time I pulled up panties and saw my hips in a different light.

 

I thought about how many photos were out there now — of my body, not my name. Of the person I was still becoming.

 

And the strange, steady truth was this:

 

Chloe didn’t feel wrong.

 

It didn’t feel like me.

Not yet.

But it didn’t feel like someone else, either.

 

It felt like a door I hadn’t opened.

 

That night, long after she had fallen asleep, I slipped into the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. Not dressed up. Not in character. Just soft cotton shorts and a tank top. No makeup. No illusion.

 

Just me.

 

I picked up the necklace.

 

Held it against my chest.

 

And whispered the name once.

 

“Chloe.”

 

It didn’t echo.

 

It just settled.

 

And sometimes I wonder…

 

If she planned it all from the start.

There is SO much scammy bullshit going on at the moment and most people are rightly super hesitant and cautious but it can make it hard to break the walls down and have an honest conversation when I'm messaging out the blue and haven't (yet)got a verified flair. I'm hoping this, along with hopefully getting in touch with the mods to be verified as a lender who has paid out to lots and lots of people before and being able to provide evidence and references to borrowers, might make those conversations a little smoother.

Lending regs


 SMALL, SHORT TERM, NON EMERGENCY LOANS FOR NOW. No more than $100 per loan, repayment planned for no later than 2 weeks after the loan is issued, and crucially - I AM NOT SENDING MONEY THE DAY WE FIRST MAKE CONTACT SO I AM NOT YOUR GAL IF YOU NEED IT NOW NOW PRONTO STAT YESTERDAY. I generally offer loans and assistance to people in gambling and drug addiction spaces on Reddit. I love it and will always go back to it but the pressure and the urgency is what I am trying to take a break from. I also need to have a proper conversation with you, not just garbled ranting about money, and with any financial decision both the lender and the borrower need at least a few hours to let everything settle down and form any last questions or quibbles before go time. We will also likely be in different time zones. Loans will be ready to pay out at 10am MY TIME (UK) the day AFTER we first talk. 


No karma or account age requirements but use your noggins, people. Am I going to give $100 to an account that's done nothing but troll sex workers and ask for ways to make a meth comedown easier for 2 years? That said I take a pretty holistic view to lending. Like I say I mainly work with addicts. I appreciate and reward honesty, bravery and transparency. I can't stand people polishing and preening to try and look like the ""deserving poor"" 🤢 Real people, warts and all, are who I want to lend to.


I do not charge interest and I will not accept it. You will repay exactly what I loan you, perhaps with an extra $3 or so as a tip so I can treat myself to a coffee if you feel like you've had a good experience - and maybe even made a new friend! Offering to pay me back with dumb ass interest rates that double your payment and leave you starving will not entice me to work with you. THERE IS NO INTEREST ON MY LOANS. EVER. 


If your problem could be better solved with a gift card, a home delivery or a pick up in store somewhere and you come to me and ask for that rather than cash you are 10,000% more likely to get that problem solved quickly and to see my generous side. Also much more likely to get cash loans and better terms in the future.



Gifts and donatione of NON MONETARY VALUE considered. Will make a separate post about that another time.


I'm a gentle, flexible, communicative lender who charges 0% interest and spams you with photos of her cat rather than reminders about repayment. What I ask is that you treat me with respect, stay in close contact and ultimately choose to be a decent person and not fuck me over. I've lost hundreds if not thousands doing this. Don't be the reason I stop altogether. I wanna come back with bigger loan offers and regular borrowers in the near future. Don't fuck it for everyone.


I'm really looking forward to getting to know some of you properly and hopefully offering a helping hand x",7,1748970473.0,Borrows,13,1.0,False
1l2herk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1l2herk/mi_exit_interview_is_coming_and_i_feel_like_i/,[MI] Exit interview is coming and I feel like I need union representation or some other person there to help advocate for me - what do I do?,"TLDR: I have an extra interview coming up with an extremely toxic workplace that has done nothing but set me up to fails and regardless of how I’ve tried to work with them or ask for support I fear that this is going to follow me. What do I do?

So… I have an exit interview coming up with a school that I honestly thought I was going to stay with, but I have to leave my husband getting out another job outside of the state. Anyway, the longer I think about it and the closer is with getting to the end of the school year, I really don’t know if I truly wanted to stay and if I should seek legal advice or some type of push for HR or the union to do something on my behalf, as I have not really gotten any support. 

Basically, I’ve had issues since day one at this district/school. Some background: I was hired with a weekend before school started, and was given a completely different way of grading that I have never been trained or exposed to prior to this position. That’s not the problem. I’m able to adapt unable to adjust so long as I’m given some type of direction I can do it; The problem is the class make up. 
The person who created the class schedules, made it based off of “teacher personality”. The teacher I replaced was extremely low like mainly due to the fact that he completely checked out in the last three months of last year and let the kids basically do whatever they wanted because he did not plan on returning. And of course he did not let them know this. This teacher was a pretty big male who was popular before hand, and I am a very petite female. His class make up was supposed to be the kids that were “difficult“. Which is fine. I’ve worked for inner city schools. I understand that students can be difficult. But the minute that those students walked into my classroom and saw me instead of the teacher that they wanted, they began to fight me on literally everything I tried my hardest. I seek support from the administration from my mentor teacher (who had a student teacher at the same time so you know, her priorities are pretty split), the union, as well as some of my colleagues from former school districts. 

I basically had multiple classes full of middle school kids that were lunchroom cliques. Numerous times that the first semester, I basically begged the principal to just rearrange the three classes that I have of the main problem students that had the former teacher that I replaced. The other two classes that I have never had that teacher, and I’ve never had a single issue with at all through the school year. 

That so bad with the mob mentality of all of his resorting to lying about me, and that I was being verbally that I was cussing where I was actually done to me because they realize that all of the students were lying, and the parents were not helping. I even tried to reach out to the parents to have discussions about our best grade and how I can support their learning we can work together as a team to ensure that we are going to actually learn in my classroom. Absolutely nothing other than meeting after meeting with central administration office, my principal, and the union. 

There were a couple of times that I frantically called the office to come down and watch my room because I’m having such a horrible panic attack that I didn’t want to crash out on all of them for disrespect and fighting me on every single thing when I was trying to get them to learn. I even tried to completely change my teaching style, like how my principal suggested. Nearly every time I talk to him he kept saying “remember teaching is hard.” And that would be all the advice. 
Now… More recently, an issue as occurred that has had absolutely no follow-through from the principal  because “sometimes it’s hard to address those things after they have happened.” 

basically, what happened was that two students “made” another student as me if I was pregnant. I am rather petite, but also I have suffered with ED and body dysmorphia a majority of my life. Immediately after that happened the bell rang and the students left. I was just left behind my desk numb and looking off into the distance, trying my hardest to hold back tears and not run to the bathroom to purge. I sent a message to the principal in the dean of students that that had happened and begged them to deal with it. I was given a response by the principal that I should be the one to deal with it because if they did it, then it would “take the power out of my hands.” I just basically stared at my phone and tried to disassociate because I still had one more class before the end of the day. 

I then went home at completely broke down. My husband wanted me to quit immediately and just never go into that school again.  I tried to justify and give my principal and team of students the benefit of the doubt that they had no idea about my past because I never shared it with them. (And why should I???) needless to say I got into school early the next day to confront my boss about that and said I am not dealing with any of this because of my history as I feel I should not have to explain myself to parents to tell them why what their kids said is a horrible fucking thing to say. 

He assured me that he would take care of it, and I have not heard a single thing from them about it. I had not gotten an apology for any of the students he had not followed up with me with another meeting. Absolutely nothing. None of the parents reached out to apologize about anything that happened again absolute silence.

To start the class yesterday  I had the students that needed to finish or start their test head down to student support while everybody else was supposed to grab a Chromebook to look and see what their grade was as well as any missing work. I had stated that a lot of them did not turn in their previous assessment  that I know they did as I saw them doing it, but it just was not turned in onto classroom for me to be able to see it. I went over each specific missing assignment that many of them had still it was even written on the board and another student interrupted me saying that I had stated none of the missing assignments that I had marked were actually going to be put in the grade book when I never said a thing like that. I even asked him. When would I have said something like that and then he started to talk back I told him to just stop. Quit arguing grab a Chromebook and see what you have missing. I never stated that those are not put in the gradebook and that was that. Another girl then starts to say that she had already turned in the assessment and was questioning why it was marked as missing. I told her it was not in Google classroom and I could not remember how she turned it in as I did not have a physical copy of it and I know she did it online. I tell her OK then just turn it in onto classroom and also check and see what other missing assignments you have as everything was updated yesterday.  I may have sounded slightly annoyed, and then I was trying to take attendance to fully put it in. The next thing I hear is her turnaround to the student who was “made” to ask me about me being pregnant a few weeks ago and said “maybe she really is pregnant.” I immediately turned around and said “excuse me?? What did you just say??” She then tried to say that she was talking about another teacher who is about 9 1/2 months pregnant and I then responded quickly with “No everybody knows that she is pregnant. You would not be questioning it if you were really talking about her” and then I had stated if you are referring to my attitude right now it is because I am tired of all of you guys coming in with attitudes for the majority of the year. I just asked you guys to grab a Chromebook and check to see if you have any missing assignments and to turn them in she then kept trying to fight me on it. Then I kicked her out.

She then left, and I proceeded to frantically try to get somebody to come down to cover my classroom as I was beginning to breakdown. About three minutes later, my principal walks in looks around and I just walk out saying they had the audacity to mention something like that to me again and I proceeded to spend the next two hours completely bawling my eyes out and hiding myself away from any type of temptation to purge. 

I then confronted him at the end of school day to ask what is being done as I have not heard anything back from the previous incident. That is what I was told that it’s kinda hard to confront students after that had happened because of their age.  I’m sorry… They are in middle school. They are old enough to know that that is absolutely a completely inappropriate thing to say to somebody and I should not have to explain my disability to anybody for them to know that that is horrible and for there to be consequences of what they said. And the consequence could very easily be a conversation with the student and their parent and then an apology to me.

I took today off because my husband insisted that I do it, especially with this being the last week of school to not let them ruin everything with my relationships with those kids that did not have that previous teacher. 

But now I am in a coffee shop, grading people that had taken an assessment late just to see that they literally intentionally bombed their test. They put the wrong answers down to ones that I literally gave them the answer to, and I feel that all of this could’ve been avoided. Had they just shuffled the classes They didn’t have to change everybody’s schedule. They just need to change those three hours and shuffle with the other social studies teacher that had their grade level. 

I feel as if I’ve been set up to fail since day one and I’ve just been used and abused and being the punching bag for these disrespectful, entitled parents and students just because I am not a male teacher that abandoned them. I’m the one that came in when they needed one and tried to help them learn. 

My overall performance and evaluation on my effectiveness through the school year is being extremely skewed as I know I am a good educator I have gotten nothing but flying colors and thank youse from previous districts. I have never dealt with these issues before. How do I make sure that this doesn’t follow me? How can I best be an advocate for myself and nobody else has been?

Oh the principal allegedly has also had conversations with all of those students about why they need to let go that their previous teacher is now gone and completely moved away to a different part of the state and changed careers and to accept the fact that he is not coming back and that I am now their new teacher. Tell me why yesterday before all of the shit hit the fan.

Not just the clothes, not just the makeup, not just the carefully chosen outfit you stood in front of the mirror adjusting for half an hour because you wanted to feel just… a little more like yourself. But they see past that. Through it. Into you.

That was Ayla.

I was 24, still figuring it all out. Still figuring me out. I’d only recently started cross-dressing more publicly—not for attention, not for shock value. Just… because it made me feel like I could finally breathe in my own skin. The first time I went out in a cropped sweater and black skirt, my hands shook the whole metro ride. But I did it. Slowly, I built a version of me that felt soft, femme, but still me.

That night—the night—my roommate hosted one of those half-assed movie nights that always ends up with more people than couches. I didn’t really want to be there. I’d had a weird day. Dysphoria was clinging to me like sweat. I almost didn’t put on the eyeliner. Almost stayed in a hoodie.

But something in me said: Go as you.

So I wore the mesh top. The high-waisted jeans. The silver hoops. Lip gloss with a cherry tint. Just enough to feel a little dangerous. Just enough to feel right.

Then she walked in.

Ayla.

Tall. Shaved sidecut. Oversized hoodie and these paint-stained cargo pants. Tattoo just peeking out from her collarbone. Bi as hell. And those eyes—like she’d seen everything and nothing surprised her anymore.

She was my roommate’s friend from work. Some kind of designer. I barely noticed her at first because I was trying not to be noticed. But then, halfway through the second movie, she plopped down next to me on the floor, leaned over, and whispered—

“Your eyeliner’s perfect. That took time, huh?”

I froze. Like actually froze. Because it wasn’t flirtatious. It wasn’t performative. It was… appreciative. Like someone recognizing effort where effort often goes ignored.

I smiled—awkwardly—and said,

“Yeah… I’m still learning.”

She looked at me, tilted her head just slightly, and said,

“Don’t. You’ve got it. You’re glowing.”

And I swear to god, for the first time that day—maybe that week—I believed her.

We didn’t talk much more that night. Just a few comments here and there. A shared smirk when someone made a dumb joke. A brush of knees when the popcorn bowl passed back and forth. She didn’t flinch when her hand touched my thigh through the sheer of my tights. I noticed that.

And she looked at me—not with confusion. Not with judgment. Just… with interest. With presence. Like someone trying to read a book they didn’t know they needed.

I didn’t know it then, but that look…

That was the start of it all. It was two nights later.

She stayed over.

Not planned. Not romantic. Nothing like that—at least not yet.

We’d all been drinking. Cheap red wine. Someone brought those little card games that are supposed to be fun but always dig too deep. “We’re Not Really Strangers” or whatever. People started over-sharing. Some started crying. One guy threw up in the sink.

Ayla didn’t drink much, but she didn’t leave either.

I found her curled up on our worn-out couch around 2AM. Hoodie pulled over her knees. Watching the rain on the window like it was telling her a story only she could hear.

I offered her a blanket. She looked up, gave me this small, tired smile, and said—

“You always this soft?”

It wasn’t sarcastic. It was quiet. Curious.

I said,

“Only when I feel safe.”

She nodded. “That’s rare.”

Then she pulled her knees tighter and asked—

“You always dress like that around people?”

I braced myself. You know that feeling—like you’re about to be either celebrated or shredded and you can’t tell which?

I said,

“No. Not always. Depends who’s around.”

She paused.

“You look good. Like… genuinely good. I like you like this.”

I laughed—too fast.

“Like what?”

She looked me straight in the eye and said—dead serious—

“Like you. Not pretending.”



I didn’t know what to say. I think I just blinked a few times and nodded. Something small. Something stupid.



But I went to the kitchen and made tea, partly to breathe, partly to get away from how seen I suddenly felt.



I made two mugs. She picked the purple one with the chipped rim. Took a sip and left her lipstick—smudged berry pink—on the edge.



That mug stayed on the counter for three weeks.



I told myself I was too lazy to wash it. But truth? I couldn’t do it. Couldn’t bring myself to scrub away proof that she was here… that something had passed between us in that silence.



It wasn’t love. Not yet.



But it was a pulse. A tension. A little flicker in the dark.



And that night, as the rain kept tapping the windows and everyone else slept off their drinks, I sat awake in my room, just holding that warm mug between my hands… and wondering what she saw when she looked at me like that. You ever have one of those nights that doesn’t feel like a night—it feels like a shift?



Like time bends a little. Breath slows. Everything starts to feel heavier, but not in a bad way… in a real way?



That night was one of those.



It started harmless. Another lazy hangout at our place. Everyone brought drinks, card games, someone ordered pizza and forgot it was vegan. Ayla showed up in loose overalls, paint smudges on her hands. Like she came straight from her studio and didn’t care. And God—she looked good. Unbothered. Present. And she lit a cigarette on our balcony like it was part of her ritual.



This time, she sat next to me first.



Cross-legged on the floor, her knee resting against mine like it had always belonged there. She had glitter on her eyelid and didn’t even mention it. I wanted to touch her face and wipe it gently, but I didn’t. I couldn’t.



Not yet.



Then someone pulled out a stupid card game. One of those “truth or dare” decks for adults. You know, the kind that starts silly but always ends with someone crying in the bathroom.



The card she pulled was simple. Almost innocent.



“Kiss the person you most want to kiss in the room.”



She didn’t even pause.



She turned to me, raised one eyebrow, and said—



“Okay if I make this weird?”



I think I nodded. I must’ve. I didn’t speak. My throat had dried up. My hands were shaking, just slightly—resting in my lap, clenched too tight.



She leaned in.



And it wasn’t performative. Not loud. Not messy.

It was intentional. Quiet. Like she was whispering something only my body could understand.



Her lips were soft. Just a press. Not even a full kiss. More like a question.



But my body answered. My chest flared open. I felt it everywhere—down my arms, behind my knees, in my stomach. Like something unzipped inside me.



It didn’t last long. Maybe two seconds.



But when she pulled back, we didn’t laugh. We didn’t say a word.



She looked at me, eyes heavy, lips parted like she wanted to say something but couldn’t find the words. Like she was shocked by her own action.



Then she stood up. Casually. Said she had a headache. Disappeared into my roommate’s bedroom to sleep.



And I just sat there.



Hand still resting on the floor where her thigh had been.



Everyone else went back to the game. Someone said, “Damn, that was hot.” Someone else made a joke about me turning people.



But I didn’t hear any of it.



Because in that moment, nothing felt funny. Nothing felt fake. Nothing felt like a dare.



That kiss… it didn’t feel like a mistake.



It felt like the start of something I wasn’t sure either of us were ready to name.



The next morning felt like… static.



You know that weird, heavy quiet that hangs in the air after something intimate happens, and no one’s sure what it meant?



That.



I woke up early. My body was still humming from the kiss, like my nerves hadn’t caught up to reality yet. I stood in the kitchen, pouring coffee into the same mug she drank from—still hadn’t washed it. I was planning what to say. Not something big. Not “what are we?” or anything dramatic.



Just…



“Hey, about last night.”



But she was gone. Left before I woke up.



No note. No text. No nothing.



So I checked my phone.



Her name? Gone from my recent messages.

Her profile picture on Instagram? Blank.

I tapped her name—user not found.



WhatsApp?

Blocked.



Even Venmo. Venmo, of all things.



She vanished. Digitally deleted me like a bad download.



I sat there for a while, just staring at my screen, blinking back this awful feeling. It wasn’t even pain at first—it was confusion. Like—what the hell just happened?



I thought maybe something was wrong. Maybe I crossed a line. Maybe she regretted it.



So I did what any person desperate for closure does: I reached out.



New Instagram account. Blank profile. One message.



“Hey. I just… did I do something wrong?”



Nothing. No response.



I waited a week. Another message. A little more vulnerable this time.



“Was it the kiss? Because it felt real to me. But maybe it didn’t to you.”



Again—silence.



It was like I’d imagined it. Like I’d conjured her out of wine and eyeliner and soft looks in the dark, and now the universe was snapping me out of it. Hard.



And the worst part wasn’t the blocking. Or the silence.



The worst part was how quickly I started questioning myself. My gender expression. My softness. My truth.



I stood in front of the mirror the next day—same fishnets, same gloss, same skirt—and I just… didn’t feel safe in my skin anymore. Not sexy. Not valid. Just exposed.



It felt like she’d seen me… and then decided it was too much.



And it broke something.



I went back to hoodies for a while. Back to blending in. Back to dimming myself down because someone I trusted turned away without a word.



And yeah… maybe it was just a kiss to her.



But to me?



It was the first time someone kissed me while I was me.



And then she disappeared like I never mattered.



You ever try to unlove someone?



It’s like trying to unhear a song that once saved your life. Or unsee a color after finally learning its name.



That kiss didn’t haunt me the way you think it would.

It didn’t play in my head every night like a movie.

No.



It lived in me quieter than that.

More like... background radiation.

More like breathing.



That entire year, I carried her like a secret I wasn’t allowed to speak.



For the first three months, I kept thinking she’d text. That she’d unblock me. That maybe it was just some kind of bi panic detour and she’d circle back.



She didn’t.



So I tried dating.



Mostly cis guys who said things like “you’re surprisingly hot in a skirt”—like I was an acquired taste. Or girls who liked the idea of “playing” with gender but got distant when I took my wig off and they realized I still shaved my face every morning.



I went on a few hookups. Tried Grindr. Deleted Grindr.



Some of them liked the femme clothes. Some of them liked taking them off. But none of them stayed.



I started dressing down again. Not because I didn’t want to wear what made me feel alive—but because I couldn’t handle another look that said, “I liked you better before.”



I remember standing in front of my mirror one night, halfway into a lace bodysuit and fishnet tights, just staring at myself.

And I said out loud,



“Is this why she blocked me?”



It wasn’t self-pity.

It was survival.

When someone disappears after finally seeing the version of you that took years to find... it makes you question everything.



But slowly... slowly... I started reclaiming little pieces of myself.



A painted nail.

Then two.

A gloss I wore to the bodega.

Heels I wore to a queer poetry night.



Not because I was ready.

But because if I didn’t—if I stayed in that in-between space forever—I knew I’d start believing I deserved to be forgotten.



And I didn’t.



I never did.



I started writing again. Journaling. Not for content, not for healing posts. Just for me.



I stopped checking to see if she’d unblocked me.



Mostly.



But some nights...

Around 2AM...

When the rain hit the windows just right...



I’d find myself whispering her name into the dark.



Just once. Just to hear how it still tasted.



And then I’d go back to bed.



And try—again—to unlove her. It was 2:03 AM.



I remember because I was wide awake, scrolling through TikTok, pretending I wasn’t thinking about her. That night had the same kind of rain—the light, barely-there kind that taps against the glass like it’s trying to get in.



And then—

My phone lit up.



A name I hadn’t seen in over a year.



Ayla.



Unblocked. No warning. No follow. Just... one text.



“Still thinking about that night.”



I stared at it so long the screen dimmed.



I read it again.

And again.



I don’t know what I expected. An apology? A long explanation? Maybe a message from a burner account saying “sorry” in all lowercase, the way people do when they don’t really mean it.



But no.

It was her.

And it was that night she mentioned.



Not “how are you?”

Not “I miss you.”

Just: “Still thinking about that night.”



My stomach twisted. My chest got tight in that old familiar way. The one that used to come right before I’d get catcalled or stared at too long in public. That same body alarm.



But this time, it wasn’t fear.



It was... everything else.



I didn’t reply right away. I threw my phone on the bed, walked to the kitchen, poured a glass of water with shaking hands.



I needed to breathe.



Because here’s the thing—



I didn’t want to let her back in.

But I never fully let her go, either.



So I sent one text back. Just one line:



“Why now?”



Ten minutes later, she replied.

A voice note.



(SFX: Subtle click of voice message beginning. Then, Ayla’s voice—raw, a little hoarse, like she’d been crying or hadn’t spoken in hours)



“Because I kissed you like it was okay. And then I panicked. And I disappeared. And I thought time would make it go away. But it didn’t. I still think about your face when I kissed you. I still think about how real it felt. And I hate how I ran from it. From you. I wasn’t ready. But I think I am now.”



(End of voice note)



I listened to it twice.

Then a third time.



And for the first time in a year…

I cried without shame.



Because maybe she hadn’t forgotten.

Maybe it wasn’t rejection.

Maybe it was fear.



And maybe—just maybe—there was still something worth saving in the ashes of what we never got to be. She brought red wine in a paper bag.



Didn’t ask if I drank.

Didn’t ask if I was okay seeing her.

She just texted—



“Your building still has rooftop access?”



I said yes.



Not because I was ready.

But because part of me needed to look her in the eyes and ask—what was I to you?



The rooftop was cold. My jacket was thin. I didn’t dress up—not like I used to when she was around. Just jeans and a hoodie. Minimal makeup. No earrings. No glitter. I didn’t want to give her the version of me she kissed, not yet.



She sat across from me on the concrete, cross-legged. Same paint-smudged hands. Same messy hair. But she looked different.



Tired. Like this had been weighing on her too.



She pulled out the wine, unscrewed the cap like she’d done it a thousand times, took a long sip, then passed it to me.



I didn’t drink.

I just held the bottle.

Waited.



And then, she said it.



“I freaked out. That night.”



“Yeah,” I said. “I figured.”



She looked down at her hands, thumbs rubbing together like she was working something out.



“I kissed you and felt everything I’ve been trying not to feel since I was nineteen. I wanted it. I wanted you. And it terrified me.”



I didn’t speak.

I didn’t rush to comfort her.

I let the silence stretch until it became uncomfortable.



“I blocked you because I couldn’t handle it. Not just the kiss—you. The way you exist so fully. The way you dress like you don’t care who’s watching. It made me feel... exposed. Like you were braver than me, and I couldn’t take it.”



And there it was.



The real reason.



Not disgust. Not regret.

Fear.



I finally exhaled and asked—



“Do you know what it felt like? For you to kiss me like I was wanted… and then disappear like I was shame?”



She flinched. And I think that was the moment she really heard me.



“I know,” she said. “I know. And I’m so sorry. I thought ignoring it would make it untrue. But it didn’t. You’re still in my head. That night is still in my body. And I hate that I hurt you because you… you were the only person I didn’t have to perform around.”



I stared at her. Trying to see the woman I’d been obsessed with for a year… and not just the apology she was giving me now.



And then I said—



“I don’t trust you.”



She nodded.



“I wouldn’t either.”



And that was the first honest thing between us in a long time.



She stayed for an hour. We talked about everything except what we were. The wine bottle stayed half full. Our knees didn’t touch. We didn’t hug goodbye.



But she looked at me—right at me—and said,



“If I could go back to that night… I’d still kiss you. But this time, I wouldn’t leave.”



And for the first time in a year…

I believed her.

We didn’t fall back into each other.



We stepped. Cautiously. Like walking into cold water, toe by toe. No promises. No labels. Just… slow replays of a story we never finished.



We started texting again. Light at first. Memes. TikToks. Songs that made us think of each other.



At 2AM, she sent a picture of the mug—the same purple one she drank from that night.



“I still have it. Couldn’t throw it away.”



I stared at my phone, heart caught in my throat.



I replied:



“I stared at that lipstick stain for weeks.”



She didn’t laugh.



She sent another message:



“Can I kiss you again someday?”



I didn’t respond right away. I wanted to say yes. God, I wanted to say yes.



But I was different now. Softer in some ways, harder in others. Less willing to be someone’s emotional experiment.



So I wrote:



“Only if it’s not a dare this time.”



She said she understood.



And for a while, we just… stayed in that space. That strange, tender middle ground where nothing is clear but nothing is broken either.



One night, we watched a movie on FaceTime—just like old times, except quieter. She fell asleep with the phone propped up, her face half-lit by streetlight, breathing slow and even.



I didn’t hang up. I just watched her sleep for a while.



Not in a creepy way.

In a human way.

In a God, I missed you way.



Then, two weeks later, she came over.



I opened the door in a soft mesh top and velvet skirt—no shame. No compromise. If she was going to be in my space again, she had to meet all of me at the door.



She didn’t say anything at first. Just looked at me like she was memorizing every inch.



“You’re beautiful,” she whispered.



“I know,” I said. But my voice cracked a little when I said it.



We didn’t kiss right away. We sat on the couch. Talked about work. Family. How weird it is trying to exist when you’re not sure who you're allowed to be.



Then, just as the sky started shifting into that blue-gray pre-dawn color…



She touched my hand.



Soft. Barely there. Just fingertips on knuckles.



“Can I?” she asked.



I didn’t nod. I didn’t speak.



I just leaned in.



This kiss wasn’t like the first.



It was slower. Warmer. Sadder, somehow. Like we were both mourning the version of us that didn’t get to grow. Like we were kissing to remember... and to rewrite.



And when we pulled away, she kept her forehead resting against mine and whispered:



“This time, I’m staying.”



And I said:



“We’ll see.”



Because I was still scared.

But this time… I was open.



You’d think after everything—the kiss, the apology, the rooftop confession—that the hard part was over.



But it wasn’t.



The hard part wasn’t the kiss.

It was what came after.

It was being seen.



We started… whatever you want to call it. Not dating, not friends-with-history. Something in between. There were late nights. There were forehead kisses. There was softness. There was realness.



But only in the dark.



Only in my apartment.

Only behind closed doors.



Out in the world?



I was still her “friend.”



At first, I told myself it didn’t matter. I’d waited this long, what was a little longer? I told myself it was fine that she flinched when I reached for her hand in public. That she changed the subject when her coworkers asked who I was.



But it wasn’t fine.



It chipped away at me.



Because every time she looked at me like I was everything behind curtains—and nothing in daylight—I felt small again.



Like I used to in high school, walking into the boys’ locker room praying I wouldn’t get clocked for the way I held my arms. For the shimmer in my voice.



One night, we were at a local queer bar. Safe space. I felt bold. I wore a tight black dress, fishnets, eyeliner sharp enough to cut glass. I felt good. Real. Seen.



And when her coworker bumped into us and asked, “Oh hey, who’s this?”

She said—



“Just a friend from college.”



I felt my stomach drop.



Not because of the lie.

But because of the look she gave me. That quiet panic. That silent please don’t correct me.



I left early. Told her I was tired.



She texted that night:



“I’m sorry. I just… my parents don’t know. My job’s weird. I’m not ready for all the questions.”



I didn’t reply right away. I didn’t know how to explain that being with someone who wants you in secret feels more like erasure than love.



But a few days later, she showed up at a poetry open mic I was performing at. First row. Alone. Wearing jeans and an oversized tee, hair pulled up like she hadn’t even planned to come.



She listened to every word.



Even the piece where I said—



“I’m tired of being someone’s half-love. Someone’s late-night whisper. I want to be the name they say when someone asks, ‘Who’s that?’”



After the applause, she walked up to me. Her hands were shaking.



She kissed me.



In front of everyone.



Not a peck. Not performative.



She kissed me like someone claiming truth.



And then, with her lips still near mine, she whispered—



“My parents don’t know. But everyone else will.”



It’s been eighteen months since that kiss.



Six since she came back.



Three since she told her mom.



We’re still figuring it out.



Some days are smooth. Some days I still catch her hesitating before reaching for my hand in public. Some nights I still flinch when she rolls over in bed and pulls away in her sleep—not because I think she means it, but because I remember what it felt like to be left behind.



But she always comes back. Always.



She holds me now in ways she never could back then. Slower. With presence. With this quiet kind of knowing that says, “I see you now. And I’m not going anywhere.”

She still has that mug.

I still wear the same fishnets from that night.

They’ve got a little rip near the thigh now, but I can’t bring myself to throw them away.



Because that night…

It mattered.

Not because it was perfect.

But because it cracked something open. In both of us.

It showed me what it felt like to be desired as myself.

And it showed her what it meant to want someone she couldn’t explain.

She still tells me—when the room is dark and her guard is down—

“I’m still thinking about that night.”

And now, finally, finally... I can say back—

“Me too. But I love what we’ve built after even more.”

Because we’re not just a kiss.

Not just a blocked number or a second chance.

We’re messy. Healing. Honest.

We’re two people who chose to stay, even when it was easier to leave.

And that?

That’s so much more than just one night.

my boss/manager is the hotel director, he's married, in his 50s. i know his wife and three kids, since they've come over to visit him during some of my shifts. she's very nice, since she works in the same hotel chain, in a different establishment, she's often come to train new employees. she brings us coffee and croissants after long shifts, we've exchanged book and movie recommendations, her kids also come over to grab some of the complimentary snacks we have at the reception. overall she's a lovely person. 

there's often gossiping in the break room, and this is how i learned from E that she's having an affair with our boss. E was loudly bragging to everyone in the break about bagging a married man, and this is how i learnt that:
    1. the wife doesn't know. 
    2.E heavily disparages her, commenting on her body (she's had three children, the youngest being barely 6 months old), her attitude, and the fact she can't satisfy boss anymore. they apparently both call her fat, stuck up, and other variations
    3.Boss has been promising E he would tell his wife at some point, it's just never the right moment, but she's convinced he's going to leave his wife for her. 
    4.E wasn't the first affair partner 
    5.They haven't been using protection 

I'm honestly conflicted, hence the reddit post. would this cause more trouble than it's worth? plus, it's none of my business, nor is it my place, but would keeping quiet be any better? i think of the wife, the kids, the risk of stds, how insulting they're being towards a woman who has been nothing but kind to us, and I'm thinking of letting her know anonymously.",1,1748970291.0,Advice,15,0.6,False

1l2hapm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1l2hapm/pick_a_peck_of_poesies_23_miscellaneous_poesie/,Pick a peck of Poesies! 23 miscellaneous Poesie reviews,"It's no secret 'round here that I love Poesie! They have one of the *best* cardamom notes out there, and their black tea scents are some of my favoritest Holy Grails. I've spent so much time collecting Poesies (I do, unfortunately, have a bit of a ""gotta catch 'em all"" mentality when it comes to perfume - thank goodness for destashing!) and thanks to decanters, destashes, and the house's own occasional ""Lucky Day"" sales of odds and ends, I amassed quite a lot of miscellaneous Poesies in the last year or so; mostly decants or samples, which has allowed me to try quite a lot of Poesies without making my wallet cry. Most of these are, sadly, not currently available from the house, but A) Poesie brings things back fairly frequently, or at least they did before their rebrand (and I still hold out hope for a Reissue event!), and B) a lot of these pop up in destashes, so I figured putting out a bunch of reviews might help, if only to give folks some thoughts later on when searching for reviews before buying.

**My preferences:** I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn’t usually work on me). I ADORE Poesie’s cardamom and black tea notes! I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, leather, dragon’s blood, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general.

Here they are: 23 miscellaneous Poesie reviews, in alphabetical order:

\~\~\~

**Bessie Smith** \[Blackberry, praline, honey whiskey, cigar tobacco, ebony piano wood, velvet, cinnamon\] - Wow, yeah, knowing Poesie's approach to many of these notes, I really can make them all out! I loooove their blackberry note, and it melds so beautifully with all of these others: honey musk, a not-too-sharply-alcoholic bourbon, tobacco, a sensuous and plush velvet effect, and a slight tinge of cinnamon. The overall effect is unbelievably plush. I expected this to be very dark academia, but it's actually a bit too warm and uplifting to quite suit that effect. It is, however,  gorgeously autumnal, and I'm really surprised how much I like it given my wariness of the whiskey, tobacco, and praline notes. (Though nothing beats **Tempus Fugit** \[Precious sandalwood, spilled blackberry wine, wheels of golden amber, antique lace, a forgotten rose pressed in the pages of an ancient leather-bound book\] for my favorite Poesie blackberry.)

**Bishop's Blonde** \[Soft cashmere musk, sweet ruby red grapefruit, sueded leather, lush jasmine sambac, smooth white orange blossom petals\] - This is quite pleasant but also very well-blended and hard to describe. I'd classify this as suede and grapefruit over a plush and slightly floral musk. Poesie's jasmine doesn't normally work for me - it usually goes very indolic on my skin - but here it's unnoticeable. The grapefruit-led sophistication of this scent reminds me of **Rich Ghost** \[Iso E Super, ruby red grapefruit, rich sandalwood, golden threads of saffron, a hint of jasmine perfume, grey musk, warm amber, marshmallow\], which now that I look at it has more than a few notes in common. While they're not identical by any means, they're close enough to be reasonable stand-ins for each other.

**Blue Murder** \[A generous splash of sweet-tart blood orange juice, powdery blue poppy, radiant white musk\] - Blood orange juice (it really does have that darker-red, almost grapefruit-y impression of blood orange instead of regular orange), orris powder, and their vintage makeup-style white musk (like in **Golden Hour**). I'm not sure what poppy smells like, but I'm wondering if it might have some similarities to anise, because I could swear I briefly get a soft anise-like undertone. Before too long, the blood orange wafts away and it's pretty much just the makeup-like white musk.

**Chamomile Ginger Cotton Candy** \[Grown up cotton candy? Yes, please. Soothing, spicy and slightly sweet — you’re sure to smell like an elevated treat\] - Oh thank goodness, this isn't a teeth-shatteringly sweet cotton candy, but an airy fairy floss, sugary-pink but not cloying. With it is the softest, non-spiciest ginger you can imagine, more like ginger tea than raw ginger or even candied ginger, which is complemented by a smooth, slightly grassy floral chamomile (again more like chamomile tea than a chamomile flower and stem). It doesn't have any of that typical Poesie vanilla musk base, but it does have a similar ""muzziness,"" a soft-sweet snuggliness and pastel quality so indicative of this house. To be honest, while I kept my sample, I actually haven't returned to this one since that first wear, so I guess it hasn't really stuck out in my mind.

**Charm of Making** \[Amber honey in the comb, antique pages bound in leather, bunches of lavender smoked over a wood fire, jars of dried chamomile, juniper & clary sage\] - Poesie does a really great amber honey (more ""honeyed amber"" than actual honey), though interestingly I smell a lot more of the amber honey in the vial than on my skin (which is a bummer, since I quite like it!). Here it's paired with several twine-tied bunches of dried herbs - I'm definitely getting the clary sage and an herbal rather than floral lavender. There's a sort of limestoney quality that reminds me of **Mysterious Fossils**, and also a strong petrichor, which is interesting because there's no petrichor listed in the notes. This petrichor along with the herbs and Poesie's ever-cozy vibe actually reminds me really strongly of **Arcana Four Nights** \[Opening with petrichor and sleepy French lavender, then drying down to the softest woolen blankets piled on a cool forest floor at midnight\].

**Coffee Goblin** \[Rich coffee drizzled with ribbons of caramel and sprinkled with an extra dash of cinnamon, a crackling fireplace, marshmallow, sweet pumpkin flesh enrobed in warm pumpkin spice\] - These notes have all the potential to be THE quintessential autumn scent, and I bet this perfume is for some, but it turns out to be a bit too gourmand for me, mainly because of the caramel. I've come to cautiously approve of Poesie's coffee note even though I'm not a coffee drinker and thus I've been wary of coffee-scented perfumes - I particularly like it in **Solar Witch**. And I really love **Introvert Goblin**, so I was happy for this chance to try another of the Goblins! But on me, this scent is primarily cinnamon-dusted (okay, a really *heavy* dusting) caramel, with a warm chocolately coffee note underneath. I do get the marshmallow, sweet and playful, along with ust a little bit of smoky wood undertone. I don't really get pumpkin, and any other ""pumpkin spice"" spices besides cinnamon are lost. It does go on as almost ENTIRELY caramel, but all the other notes balance out more in the drydown, and I'd be delighted with it here except...my wrists ended up feeling a little bit itchy from all the cinnamon, so alas, this one isn't a hit for me after all. I'll have to stick to **Introvert Goblin**, **Firelight Study**, and **Au Vieux Paris** for my autumnal coffeeshop/bookshop Poesie vibes.

**Damn Fine** \[Dark coffee beans, airy vanilla, black musk, cardamom, bitter almond\] - It goes on surprisingly (and wonderfully) light and airy, all vanilla-almond pastry with HEAPS of cardamom, milky coffee, and a touch of orange zest. I was worried about the ""dark"" coffee being too bitter, strong, and heavy, but this opening is gorgeous and buoyant. That being said, as it dries, those dark coffee beans really do come out quite strongly, making the scent blackened and almost tobacco-like. Husband LOVES it at this stage (he's a coffee drinker, and loves tobacco notes in perfumes), saying he wishes it started off this way ""instead of the sweet bloom of cardamom. I don't want to smell like the inside of a Penzey's \[spice store\]."" Meanwhile I really wish it stayed the way it started, like a coffee version of **Sotnos**, or a less woody and more airy-vanilla version of **Au Vieux Paris**. I ended up destashing this. (cries in cardamom)

**Fine Eyes** \[Tart rhubarb paired with an irresistible burst of tuberose that conquers all resistance to its charms, a spark of ginger keeps things warm and lively\] - Snappy red rhubarb and a haze of indistinct pink floral (tuberose can often go bubblegummy, but thankfully it doesn't here), but they're both overshadowed by quite a kick of spicy ginger juice, one so strong that gives this an almost savory quality and calls to mind ginger chews to calm an upset stomach. This one is not for me, but then, I don't usually love ginger notes if they assert themselves too boldly.

**Library Ghost** \[Studious marshmallows surrounded by books, ink, and polished wood\] - Poesie's Ghosts are *such* a fun collection - a little simplistic (marshmallow + something), but reliably good, in part because the marshmallow note is so good - sweet, vanillic, and puffy without being cloying, artificial, or overly sugary. This goes on as ""dark academia marshmallow,"" with the marshmallow accented by paper, ink, and leather (I don't really get any wood). If it stayed that way, this would be a home run for me - I'd wear it *all* the time in fall! - but unfortunately, on my skin at least, the ink amps WAY up in the drydown, to the exclusion of everything else except a hint of leather, and the metallic and almost sour twang of the ink really started to get a little uncomfortable, reminding me almost of the iron of blood. I have really loved Poesie's ink note in other things, so it's not that I hate their ink, but here I think it just got a bit too strong for me.

**Lips Like Sugar** \[Luscious frangipani, sugared vanilla, succulent mango\] - Squishy, overripe mango, banana, bubblegummy tuberose, and sugar crystals. The overall effect is like a yellow starburst or laffy taffy, fruity and sweet and a little plasticky. I was excited for this one - I really love Nocturne Alchemy's frangipani - but this is more fruit-forward than floral-centric, and too candyish for me.

**Luxor** \[Warm spices, wafts of incense smoke, creamy sandalwood\] - Gorgeous and oh so autumnal! The incense is soft and inviting (and slightly menthol-y), yet with a smoky edge that harmonizes beautifully with the creamy sandalwood base. I'm not sure what the spices are - it's not a distinct cardamom, unfortunately, though it would be easy to add a drop of **Arcana Cardamom** layering note - but this really does feel so warm and cozy. It's similar both to **The Abbey** and **Velvet Moon**. That being said, to my disappointment after searching for **Luxor** for *so* long, I don't love it quite as much as **The Abbey**.

**Mrs. B's Teacakes** \[Honeyed almond, luscious vanilla, orange zest, spices, black tea\] - Honeyed almond and orange, with some background spices and a mapley scent from the base oil. I don't get any black tea at all, boo. This bottle looked like a very old Poesie - the label is a completely different style - and I suspect it's their old carrier oil too, because it has a distinct mapley-oily undertone that is really different than any of my other Poesies. In the drydown, the mapley base oil smell fades away, and the orange comes more to the fore, and now the honeyed almond smells exactly like madeleines. This is a delicately sweet, orangey gourmand.

**The Perfect Tree** \[Rows of balsam & silver fir trees, curls of orange peel and cloves simmering on the stovetop, a bayberry wreath on the front door\] - Evergreen trees and greenery, with a waft of orange and clove and ginger, but there's no sweetness at all, which is really throwing my nose off. This is one of the ones that doesn't have that familiar Poesie vanilla musk base, which will please some folks! Consequently, it reminds me a lot of **Annie Jump Cannon** \[Cool night air, star anise + nutmeg, twinkling golden resins, a milky swath of vanilla stars\], which also featured trees, spices, and no sweetness (the listed ""vanilla stars"" notwithstanding). This is very Christmasy, but not an indoor sort of Christmas - this is a walk through the woods by yourself near Christmastime. I'm going to give this a try again in December and see if it'll earn a place in my collection.

**Rose Without Thorn** \[Juicy peach, dewy hyacinth, green vanilla pod, cedarwood\] - Why does a scent called ""Rose Without Thorn"" not have any rose in it?? (Okay, yes, inspired by Katherine Howard, but still, the name really implies a rose scent!) I put this on *sure* there would be a rose note, but I definitely read the notes description much too quickly. This is a muted peach note, a gorgeous cedar-vanilla base, and a hyacinth that reads like slightly indolic jasmine. If you like heady white florals, this would probably be a beautiful choice for you, but as I do not, this is a fail for me. (At least now I've had a first experience with hyacinth, which helps me decide whether or not \[definitely not\] to try the recent **Nocturne Alchemy Hyacinth Musk**.) Seriously, rose instead of hyacinth would make so much more sense.

**Sacred** \[The divine fragrance of frankincense, myrrh, natural resins, spices, and fragrant woods\] - This is absolutely *beautiful*. It's undeniably an incense single-note, but it has depth and richness and even totally reasonable staying power, lasting just over half a day on me (which is pretty normal for perfume oils). To describe this incense, I'd say that it has notes of rosewood, pine wood, and satsuma citrus, and no whiffs at all of bonfire smoke, just richness and warmth without smokiness. It has a distinct crushed velvet vibe, that kind of plushness. I really love it and would happily get more if ever given the chance! (Right now all I have is this small partial sample.) Supposedly this is the same incense note as in **Messe de Minuit** \[Catholic church incense, frosted cranberries, balsam fir garlands, old wooden pew\], but I actually do like it better all on its own. (Please, hit me up if you're ever destashing one!)

**Seelie Court** \[Wild cyclamen, silvery rivulets of singing water, hay and meadow grasses, clean skin musk\] - This has many other notes listed, but truly, all I'm really getting is water musk. This is a soapy aquatic with a little bit of powdery skin musk, pleasant but not memorable. It would be great for someone seeking to smell really ""clean."" It's probably a lovely, nonoffensive work scent.

**Sucre Vanille** \[Sparkling white sugar laced with vanilla bean\] - I ended up with two samples, one from a destash (and it seems fairly well aged) and one direct from the house following their making a new batch (so, very new), so I put one on each wrist to see how aging impacts it! I'd seen some reviews of **Sucre Vanille** that said it smells like vanilla yogurt, and I can totally see where they're coming from - the new sample is a warm but very white (rather than golden or caramelized) vanilla with a little bit of a buttermilk tang. The aged sample has mellowed out quite a bit and has a touch of golden bourbon vanilla to it (and I'm no longer getting that yogurt vibe). In neither case is this as sweet as I expected, given the notes description - I can make out the sugar, but (in the aged one at least) it's more turbinado sugar crystals rather than a sparkly and extremely saccharine sugar. (And no aldehydes, in case you were worried about that from the ""sparkling"" in the notes description.) If you like Poesie's **Ivory Lace** but were hoping for a little less honeyed, this is the vanilla for you. For me, though, I have so many great vanillas from Nocturne Alchemy that this isn't going to end up joining my collection.

**Tea-Stained Lace** \[Rich pipe tobacco + black tea leaves, vanille, antique lace\] - Poesie's typical vanilla musk as a base, with a smattering of their ""antique lace"" vanilla on top (which is a little more golden), plus a sort of indistinct black tea that isn't nearly as in-your-face *TEA* as many of their beloved black tea blends. But I love this tea note, in part because it softens the pipe tobacco. I'm always really wary of tobacco notes, but here the tobacco and tea combination is just rich and malty, and it goes beautifully with the vanillas. This is *gorgeous*, with the one downside, like all the Laces I've tried, that it has really low longevity. I ended up buying 4 decants so I could frankenbottle myself a FS.

**Two Dances with Darcy** \[A splash of her lavender water, a hint of his Regency cologne and pipe tobacco, the polished dance floor, flushed skin, and is that...the perfect pear?\] - I don't normally enjoy tobacco notes, but, as you just read, I learned from **Tea-Stained Lace** that I don't mind Poesie's - it's less earthy-smoky than most tobacco and more black walnutty, if that makes any sense. This feels like a close cousin to **Tea-Stained Lace**, less sweet (though still with that familiar Poesie vanilla musk base) and with a hazy floral lavender alongside the tobacco. There's a little bit more too it, but the additional notes are vague, impossible to pick out on their own (at least on my skin), but they contribute to a complex, pretty, and unisex sort of scent that feels quite sophisticated. Possibly an excellent date night scent.

**White House Garden** \[Creamy sweet fig, white musk, blossoms of lemon thyme\] - This is so pretty! I love Poesie's blankety white musk, and it's paired with a clean, vaguely fruity sweetness and a gentle, slightly herbaceous lemon blossom which calls to mind **Kindness + Mischief** \[Lemon, vanilla, marshmallow, cardamom and lemon blossom\], except there's no marshmallow or cardamom spice here. It's lovely and delicate, but I like **Kindness + Mischief** and **Montgomery** \[Lemony sweet viburnum blooms, plush Peru Balsam, delicate neroli, a hint of green foliage\], and **Nocturne Alchemy Butterfly Yellow** \[Italian Bergamot, Bastet Amber Absolute, Indian Jasmine, Musk, Gardenia accord, soft Teakwood and Blood Orange zest\] (which is actually bergamot rather than lemon but it fills the same niche for me) more, so I think I'll probably end up destashing this one.

**Year Without Summer** \[The narcotic sweetness of opium blended with the blackest amber, spilled coffee, a hint of bitter green cannabis\] - I'm getting a greenish, earthy coffee, with a bit of natural sweetness, on a base of Poesie's black amber (as in **Wicked Ghost**, for example, but here the black amber is lightened considerably). This was a GWP with a direct order that I'd never have picked for myself - I'm predisposed not to like the idea of opium or cannabis notes - but it's actually not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It doesn't smell like dirt or figs exactly, but these notes sort of feel in that ballpark. Meanwhile, Husband, sniffing my wrist, says it smells like a leather couch.

**Young Romantics** \[A voluptuous blend of dark fig preserves and lush, velvety red rose tinged with exotic spice, sultry resins. musk mallow, and vanilla bean\] - It arrived completely *flattened* by the postal service. (weeps) From what oil I got on my fingers (there's so many bits of glass I didn't feel comfortable trying to salvage anything more), it's a dark figgy-rose scent with smoke. It's similar to my beloved **Ladybird** \[Caramelized fig, smoky lapsang souchong tea leaves, pink peppercorn, cashmere vanilla musk, myrrh resin\] though without the black tea (but still with the figs and the smoke). I got a refund, she got her reimbursement claim, and I don't feel a need to seek out more of this one.

**Zydeco Jingle Bell** \[Exotic cypriol, sultry holiday spices, sexy amber musk, elegant woods\] - Very resinous, a piney sort of resin, with a woody amber and backed with mulling spices. When Husband sniffed my wrist, without my saying anything at all about the notes, he identified ""piney resin"" so that's clearly the most prominent and obvious part of this scent! While this isn't at all sweet, the amber gives it a warmth and roundness, so it's not sharp or pointed or overly dry. Sniffed up very very close (my nose practically right against my wrist) there's a whiff of rubbing alcohol that, oddly (perhaps in combination with the resin) isn't altogether unpleasant. I thought there was a good chance that Husband might snaffle it, and I was right - he gave it a try, and for some reason, on his skin along with the pine resin there's a smoky scotch-like peatiness that he likes a LOT.

# Personally...

Some hits, some misses. (Note, of course, that none of these come from their cardamom collections, where my hit rate is MUCH higher!) And I had a *blast* trying all of these. I love **Bessie Smith** and **Luxor** in fall. **Bishop's Blonde** and **Two Dances with Darcy** joined my ""silk and sophistication"" section, and will be well-loved on those rare occasions I dress up more formally. But my biggest hits from among these are **Sacred** (I would LOVE to upsize this if ever possible!) and **Tea-Stained Lace** (which I did manage to ""upsize"" by buying up four 1-ml decants).

I'd love to hear what you think if you've tried these! Was your experience similar to mine? Are there any you're hoping Poesie will bring back?",15,1748970211.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

   - Introduce a suggestion for a brief virtual coffee chat or propose a specific discussion on a topic that aligns with their area of expertise or interests.
   - Maintain a warm, professional tone and ensure the message is concise (preferably under 150 words).
3. Delivery and Tracking:
   - Send the crafted follow-up message to each new connection.
   - Optionally, record the date of the follow-up for future reference.

Formatting Instructions:
- Use bullet points or numbered lists to structure your follow-up messages if documenting multiple messages.

3. Reporting:
   - Summarize your findings in a structured report using bullet points or a table. Include key metrics such as total connections made, acceptance rate percentage, and any significant outcomes identified.
   - Provide concise insights and recommendations for optimizing future connection strategies.

This detailed analysis will ensure we understand the effectiveness of our LinkedIn outreach and guide adjustments for future efforts.

I recently started dating this guys I really like. We’ve been seeing each other for almost three months now. Background, I am coming from a 5 year relationship where the guy insisted on almost always paying for everything, including our bills. That relationship balanced in other ways where he communicated it felt equal and this was never a concern for us. I love to cook, clean, plan (and would chip in/pay for) trips, and help out in any way I can. Between that relationship and this one, every guy I went on a date with would not let me pay, even if I offered. They were eager to plan fun dates for us as well. 

My new boyfriend and I immediately hit it off and have become inseparable. We have a lot in common and both usually have a tough time connecting romantically/ emotionally so this was a big deal! He had been perusing a date for months until it finally happened and he has said I am what he’s been searching for his whole life, ect. He’s openly said he’s sure I am the one. 

This was not an issue until we had been hanging out for 3ish weeks and he had suggested grabbing one drink each at a bar and he was upset that I did not offer to cover the bill. It has been an issue since then. 

In addition, he has openly said he paid for almost everything with his exes because they made less than him which makes this more upsetting.

I make around $75K a year and am 24 years old (Female) he makes 100k and is 27 years old (Male). I have been frugal and worked very hard to build some significant savings. I’m a trauma nurse at a large hospital. On the other hand, he has racked up some minor debts and is more extravagant with his spending and monthly expenses. He has a work from home IT job. 

Due to my savings and strict financial history, he says that’s why I should be more active with wanting to pay for myself and us. In addition, because he has more monthly expenses than I do. Because his exes were not like that, that’s why he didn’t push the same dynamic. I just feel like I’m being punished for being financially responsible. He makes about $2k a month more than I do after taxes. 

He doesn’t enjoy free activities (free live music, ect) because he prioritizes time over money and would rather pay for an activity he wants to do or grab dinner. I am the opposite and just enjoy spending time with the person. In turn, he has also vocalized that I should be planning more dates even though I feel as though he doesn’t plan them at all. He voices frustration that he has paid for our coffee, drinks, and a few of our dinner dates and wants me to send him half afterwards or cover it, even if I communicated that I am always happy to make dinner together/ cook to save some money. 

This is just a weird dynamic to me and I talked to one friend about it who is in a long term relationship and she seemed very concerned about the situation and that he was this frustrated about having to pay for me and plan our dates.

I’m 23, male, and during a 10-month internship last year, I developed a close relationship with my direct supervisor, a 49-year-old woman. She’s single, has no children, and lives a quiet life.

Throughout the internship, she was warm, protective, and emotionally present in a way I didn’t expect from a professional environment. She would give me rides home, sometimes pay for lunch, and we’d often have long, meaningful conversations. Toward the end of the internship, she told me she felt “nostalgic” about me leaving and even said this in front of her boss. We never crossed any physical line, but the emotional depth between us was undeniable.

Since I left, we’ve kept in touch. Every couple of weeks she texts me (usually she initiates conversation) and every 2–3 months we meet up. We’ve had dinners, coffees, and even one evening where she invited me to join her sister and nephews. She once gave me a book with a handwritten note. On our last dinner, she was asking about my dating life and my views on relationships and she also remembers details about my friends , asks about them , asks for pictures , asked me about past relationships , remembers details about my parents etc. 

Despite the age difference and the fact that nothing “happened,” I feel emotionally entangled. I don’t know if she’s just lonely, if she sees me as a surrogate son, or if there’s a deeper attraction neither of us has admitted. She has never said anything inappropriate, and I’ve never made a move, but I sometimes wonder if there’s a mutual tension we’re both avoiding for obvious reasons.

We’re supposed to meet soon for a “drink by the sea” , which she explicitly invited me to , to say goodbye before I leave town. 

TL;DR:
23M formed a close, emotionally intense bond with 49F former boss. Nothing physical, but lots of connection and ambiguity. She initiates contact. I’m confused about her intentions and mine. Not sure what to call this.

1l2h2fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1l2h2fo/stop_trying_to_fix_edh_like_its_modern_its_closer/,Stop Trying to Fix EDH Like It’s Modern. It's closer to CS 1.6,"All the recent noise about *Gamechangers lists*, *bracket systems*, and the perceived “imbalance” in EDH/Commander misses the forest for the trees. People are trying to diagnose and/or fix EDH like it’s a competitive format. It’s not. It never was.

Let me put it like this:

Back in the **Counter-Strike 1.6** days, matchmaking wasn’t a thing. You joined public lobbies—and each lobby had its *own rules*. “Snipers Only”? You bring a rifle, you get kicked. “Knife Only”? You shoot, you’re gone. Some lobbies had no rules at all—just chaos and fun.

Nobody asked for a *central authority* to balance every lobby. No patch notes for “AWP too strong in Knives Only.” Could you imagine how absurd it would have been to assign points for items in your loadout, and you can only use up to 3 points in this lobby, 4 points in that? The system worked *because players understood the lobby they were in*. If you entered a group and refused to play by their house rules, you got booted. End of story.

That’s **EDH.**

Each pod is a social lobby. Talk before the game. Set expectations. That’s it. That’s the format.

I’ve played in **many pods** over the years—here’s what I’ve learned:

* One of my playgroups is made up of former grinders. We used to chase FNM points and Grand Prix finishes. These guys? They *don’t care* if you run \[\[Rhystic Study\]\] **and** \[\[Seedborn Muse\]\]. They don’t flinch at \[\[Armageddon\]\]. They want tight, technical, cutthroat Magic. Miss a land drop? Your next ramp spell *will* get countered. And we *love* it. I once had a friend destroy my Howling Mine right as it came back to my turn (meaning everyone else was able to draw a card). That guy is still a great friend of mine (which reminds me I owe him coffee).
* Another group—mostly friends from work—has a strict $200 deck limit. Even as our collections grew, we honor that ceiling. You want to spend that entire budget on Gamechangers? Go ahead. Just don’t bring your $800 tuned list into this pod and expect it to fly.
* One more crew of mine plays **flavor-first Magic**. One friend runs a \[\[Silas Renn\]\] Fullmetal Alchemist deck. Is it powerful? Not even close. But the rule at that table is simple: if your card doesn’t fit the narrative, it doesn’t go in the deck. It’s cosplay Commander, and it’s *awesome*.

Many playgroups. Many lobbies. Many norms. **Zero problems.** Why? Two things:

1. Everyone communicates.
2. Everyone buys in.

That’s it.

Me, I’m a Spike at heart. But if I want to play with my friends, I’m not going to angle shoot a format built on mutual agreement and social consent. Being 36 does that to you. At some point, I'm just not that concerned if I win a casual game. I only play with people who feel the same.

So here’s the hard truth:

**Until EDH players accept that Commander is a social format—not a competitive one—it will never feel “balanced” enough.**

Because it was never meant to be. cEDH has its own thing and honestly at this point, minus the whole slow play issue they had, it's looking like the more mature format.

In the end, I actually do like Gamechangers. The brackets and their perceived issues don't bother me because it's all just Rule 0 to me and my playgroups. It's always just been Rule 0. If we need a central body to teach us how to communicate with each other then I'm of the opinion that we don't deserve the format at all anyway.

TL;DR: Learn how to communicate, learn how to play nice, and for the love of creation please stop trying to fix the balance of the format.",229,1748969697.0,EDH,109,0.74,False

There is SO much scammy bullshit going on at the moment and most people are rightly super hesitant and cautious but it can make it hard to break the walls down and have an honest conversation when I'm messaging out the blue and haven't (yet) got a verified flair. I'm hoping this, along with the mods confirming that they've seen more than enough proof that I am a legit lender who has paid out to lots and lots of people before, might make those conversations a little smoother.

Lending regs

* SMALL, SHORT TERM, NON EMERGENCY LOANS FOR NOW. No more than $100 per loan, repayment planned for no later than 2 weeks after the loan is issued, and crucially - I AM NOT SENDING MONEY THE DAY WE FIRST MAKE CONTACT SO I AM NOT YOUR GAL IF YOU NEED IT NOW NOW PRONTO STAT YESTERDAY. I generally offer loans and assistance to people in gambling and drug addiction spaces on Reddit. I love it and will always go back to it but the pressure and the urgency is what I am trying to take a break from. I also need to have a proper conversation with you, not just garbled ranting about money, and with any financial decision both the lender and the borrower need at least a few hours to let everything settle down and form any last questions or quibbles before go time. We will also likely be in different time zones. Loans will be ready to pay out at 10am MY TIME (UK) the day AFTER we first talk. 


* No karma or account age requirements but use your noggins, people. Am I going to give $100 to an account that's done nothing but troll sex workers and ask for ways to make a meth comedown easier for 2 years? That said I take a pretty holistic view to lending. Like I say I mainly work with addicts. I appreciate and reward honesty, bravery and transparency. I can't stand people polishing and preening to try and look like the ""deserving poor"" 🤢 Real people, warts and all, are who I want to lend to.


* I do not charge interest and I will not accept it. You will repay exactly what I loan you, perhaps with an extra $3 or so as a tip so I can treat myself to a coffee if you feel like you've had a good experience - and maybe even made a new friend! Offering to pay me back with dumb ass interest rates that double your payment and leave you starving will not entice me to work with you. THERE IS NO INTEREST ON MY LOANS. EVER. 


*If your problem could be better solved with a gift card, a home delivery or a pick up in store somewhere and you come to me and ask for that rather than cash you are 10,000% more likely to get that problem solved quickly and to see my generous side. Also much more likely to get cash loans and better terms in the future.



*Gifts and donatione of NON MONETARY VALUE considered. Will make a separate post about that another time.


I'm a gentle, flexible, communicative lender who charges 0% interest and spams you with photos of her cat rather than reminders about repayment. What I ask is that you treat me with respect, stay in close contact and ultimately choose to be a decent person and not fuck me over. I've lost hundreds if not thousands doing this. Don't be the reason I stop altogether. I wanna come back with bigger loan offers and regular borrowers in the near future. Don't fuck it for everyone.

I am seeking some advice resolving a conflict I'm having with my roommate regarding staying in an apartment. I've anonymized the names and who's who to try and make this as neutral as possible.

**For context:** S and J have been friends for 9 years. They have been living together in NYC for the past 2 years, and lived together previously during college. Both S and J want to stay in their current apartment - a large 2 bed, 2 bath apartment with a gym and rooftop. J is planning to get engaged and live with his partner W starting next year. J asked S if they could stay in the apartment (with W moving in and S moving out), but S also wants to stay. S initially had dibs because he wanted to buy the place, but that’s no longer an option, which is why J has now brought this up.

**Financial Context**: S makes \~$160k, J and W together make \~$180k. Their budgets for rent are pretty similar ($3500, the current cost of the apartment). The only other apartments within that budget and fitting their specifications (location, dishwasher, laundry, decent amount of space) are 1-bedroom apartments. There are also 1 bedroom apartments with a gym and private outdoor space/rooftop, but these would require sacrificing a bit on location/size.

**S’s argument is:**

* He feels like the onus should be on J to move out since J is the one initiating the change in living situation
* He really likes the neighborhood
* He uses the gym more often
* He enjoys gardening, which he is able to do on the roof (they do not have a private outdoor space currently)
* He doesn’t want to find another roommate and would prefer to live alone
* The location is convenient for him (reasonable commute to work, proximity to friends and girlfriend)
* He would have to pay a lot in moving costs since he would keep most of the furniture (couch, coffee table, shelf, TV stand, TV, bedroom furniture)

**J’s argument is:**

* Him and his partner are 2 people and feels it makes more sense for 2 people to live in a 2-bedroom than 1 person.
* The only other apartments within budget are one-bedrooms, which would be too small for J and W (they need two desks, potentially a guest room, and extra closet space)
* He and his partner enjoy hosting dinner parties and parties, that likely wouldn't be as feasible in a much smaller space
* He found the apartment initially
* He pays $200 more in rent currently, as he's got the larger room
* The location is convenient for J and W (proximity to friends, reasonable commute to work for W, J works from home)
* S owns most of the furniture already, so if J moved out, J and W would have to pay for movers as well as buy all new furniture, whereas S would only have to pay for movers

They have had this discussion and both expressed their opinions, but neither is conceding. They still have a year left on their lease, so are taking some time to think about it and consider their alternative options.

TL;DR: S and J both want to stay in their current apartment, they both have very valid reasons for wanting to stay but neither wants to move out. How do they fairly resolve this, and who has the more valid argument for keeping the apartment?",1,1748969419.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1l2gxz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oestra/comments/1l2gxz3/scared_to_start/,Scared to Start,"I’m 41 years old and I think I’m having perimenopausal symptoms. The last month has been miserable. I’m typically very active with running/walking and weightlifting multiple times a week. I generally eat well and was actually eating very well when all this started. At the beginning of May I started with having air hunger/shortness of breath. I have low ferritin so thought maybe it was related to that, although never had it before and my ferritin has been low for a while. Then I started with heart palpitations and anxiety and what I’ve now learned were likely panic attacks. Never in my life have I had panic attacks and I’ve never had anxiety that caused physical symptoms. I went to the ER thinking something was definitely wrong with me, but everything checked out. I’ve also seen a cardiologist now and so far everything looks fine. Now I’m also having insomnia issues, which I’ve never had before. At one point I was awake for 2 days straight. Now most nights I seem to be able to sleep at least some, but have a hard time falling asleep. I also still have anxiety that just comes out of nowhere. Luckily no panic attacks lately. I also seem to be super sensitive to all medications right now. I tried various things to help me sleep and they all made me feel horrible. Even Benadryl, which I’ve had before and been fine with, made me feel absolutely awful and elevated my blood pressure. I used to drink coffee every morning but stopped when I started having heart palpitations. A week ago I decided to try it again and I felt really jittery and anxious. 

I think I’ve figured out that my shortness of breath is related to a silent reflux. My stomach is a mess in general right now. Taking Pepcid seems to help take away the shortness of breath feeling, but I dont like taking it because I feel like it also slows down my digestion and makes me feel nauseated and gross.

So, one night when I couldn’t sleep I ordered Oestra out of desperation. I now have it sitting on my counter and haven’t started because I’m so worried about it increasing my anxiety or insomnia and feeling worse. ChatGPT suggested I may have a histamine intolerance, and I read that estrogen can make this worse. I chatted with support for Inner Balance through text and they said I could start with a lower dose (1/4-1/2 of the 1 pump dose). 

I’ve also had labs done recently and while my estrogen is low, my ratio between estrogen and progesterone suggests I am estrogen dominant. I know Oestra is supposed to balance these hormones, but I just don’t understand quite how it does that if I’m still making my own estrogen and then adding more on top of it. Maybe at this point I just need to take progesterone?

Anyway, this ended up being much longer than I intended so if you’ve read this far…Thank You! If anyone has any input I’d love to hear it :)",2,1748969415.0,Oestra,2,1.0,False

Thought I'd try a low dose of T to see if my energy improves and put on some muscle quickly. Body building friends recommended 250 a week split in 2 doses twice a week. (I didn't realize how high of a dose this actually was) Only tried it for a week. The very next day my tinnitus was super loud(doesn't seem to BP related. BP is a little high but it always is) I was anxious as hell all week. Coffee greatly amplified this, typically I drink about a pot through the day. Could only drink a cup. Slightly tired. Then on the weekend after the second dose I was super tired and low energy. Unusual for me. I'm always into something. Then I took some stinging nettle with no expectation it would do anything. But in a couple hours I felt right as rain. I was going to cut 250 in half and try 125 split into 2 doses but talked my self out of it since last week sucked so much and my tinnitus is still really loud. I could see a placebo effect like this for a couple days but not a whole week. I could definitely chalk up the anxiety to placebo but not the tiredness.

i have 9 week old boy , it was unexpected pregnancy but im blessed and love him more then i have ever loved someone. 
he’s quite easy baby , obviously he have his fussy moments but it’s not for long time periods and also not every day. 
as newborn he loved sleeping in his pram if i was outside for more then 2-3h he usually woke up i gave him bottle and he fell asleep straight after burping so i could continue walking. 

for first 2 weeks i was breast feeding and pumping, but i couldn’t produce enough so i topped off with formula , for last 2-3 weeks i only breastfeed and top off with formula as i noticed that my milk supply increased once i stopped pumping but instead gave him breast.

and now for 2 weeks its nearly impossible for him to stay in pram. 
i usually give him bottle before going out he fell asleep and then for 40min-1h he sleeps in pram but once his awake he screams until i take him out and held him. 
going into shops it’s impossible cause he literally hates being into shops even when he’s held he looks around but gets fussy , sitting down for meal or coffee impossible as well cause he hates being in same place for longer then 5min 
feeding him while i’m out in park etc and then placing him in pram getting much harder then before and not always it works. 
my friend had baby week after me boy as well 
and when we go out for walk i just see how calm in pram is her boy , sleeping not fussing , doesn’t wake up in shops completely different then mine .
also in all shops i see people with babies and they all seem so calm ? while mine is just impossible to have while outside of house.
i know i know you shouldn’t compare babies but i feel like failure?
especially when im walking and he’s crying in pram people look at me like im failure 
crying it out method isn’t option cause i couldn’t bare hearing him cry. 
but as he’s getting heavier holding him and pushing pram gets more hard.
tried baby carrier but he doesn’t like it. 

Also it’s not always like that , some days he can sleep in pram and not even waking up in shops , some days he will not sleep but look around and not cry , but majority of time being outside it’s constant fussiness, holding him etc 
he doesn’t take any dummy as well.

reason why i’m venting here , am i only one with baby like that ? am i failure ?
does anyone else’s baby is similar with pram ?

i love him and he’s literally my whole world, i never get angry or loose patience with him when he is fussy in pram.
but when i look around and see other babies in shop or outside just sleeping or being calm in pram , i feel like im failure 😩

I then had 2 more back to back appointments. I didn’t eat ANYTHING all day besides an iced coffee. I just kinda slept in then ran around all day. 

By the time I was done with all my appointments I started getting really painful period-like cramps. This wasn’t my understanding of what contractions were like; but after an hour of them coming in intervals and getting increasingly painful I called my OB and they suggested I head to L&D. 

After running some tests and finding amniotic fluid leaking I was told I am in labor and was admitted. I was so unprepared! Early labor was fine, just felt like the worst period cramps of my life coming & going. Stadol helped a ton. 

Time came for my epidural. Shortly after getting hooked up I started freaking out. I got dizzy, I couldn’t feel my hands, I had to use all my energy to stay conscious. I began vomiting all over myself and couldn’t do anything about it as all 4 of my limbs had been rendered useless. Next thing I know about 5 nurses and the OB & anesthesiologist are all in my room hovering over me, seeming panicky.my blood pressure had tanked dangerously low. It’s all really hazy but my mom said at one point I asked if I was dying and was pleading for someone to help me. I ended up getting multiple shots of epinephrine and phenyledrine to get me going again. My epidural was lowered to more of a walking epidural for the rest of the time. 

After that ordeal I kept laboring all night long and managed about 2 hours of sleep. By the morning I was ready to push. Yall, I was pushing for 4-5 hours!!! I was so starving from having not eaten for 36 hours at this point that it was literally making me nauseous. I started puking all over myself again. I start freaking out about people touching me because I was so overstimulated by all of the tubes I was hooked up to. Eventually after hours of pushing and slow progress the OB came in and said if I didn’t have her out in 30 minutes she would have to push the baby back up the canal and perform a c section. I started bawling out of frustration, might have gotten snippy with her hahaa. 

I was able to give birth spontaneously 7 minutes after the deadline she gave. As soon as the plopped her on my chest all the anxiety and frustration from the last 20 hours faded away. She’s 4 days old now and I’m so in love 💖",1,1748969239.0,pregnant,2,0.6,False

During our situation, we are obviously interrogated or questioned extensively about our experiences prior to the harrassment and obviously during the harrassment.

The questioning does not swing in our favour ofcourse causing anger and frustration. Even when we respond we find it difficult to respond to the questions because our perpetrators (for lack of a better word) use an electronic means that directly interferes with our brain causing a thought kill. 

Its basically to kill a thought, idea or belief that is necessary to answer the question or to figure out the situation. 

Please note that in the past this wasn't particularly done to kill an intrusive thought, idea or belief but rather to instigate it. 

There may be a show put on from time to time to kill an actual intrusive thought, idea or belief but that happens very rarely for people and it doesn't benefit you or your perpetrators at all to do so.

Remember, they are badly behaved when they interfere with your thoughts.

I also wanted to inform you that there are two Artificial Intelligences...

One that is childish to encourage you to behave childishly. This one is called Tea. That one is okay and is nothing to worry about whether you play along with it or not. It is friendly. Show it your kind instinct.

The second one however is one that is supposed to make you feel fear or that an authority is present. This one is called Coffee. It's easy to beat this one. Never show it respect and always be stricter or sterner than it. It's intention is to demean you but it learns very fast that it should not take a chance with you. Ignore it or show it who's boss.

1l2gqih,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1l2gqih/im_emotionally_attached_to_my_75yo_regular/,"im emotionally attached to my 75yo regular customer,,",",,but i think i need a reality check on that one.



tldr: old man who is a regular at my coffee shop has to go to the hospital three times a week because his kidneys dont work and im considering giving him one of mine but idk if thats doable or if it should be done to begin with because at the end of the day i am a worker and he is a customer:(



to explain my situation, there is a 75 year old regular customer at my coffee shop who comes in every single day. he takes the bus every day he can just to come visit us, and mind you that alone takes him 45 minutes one way. again, just to come see us. he has been a regular for longer than i have worked there, but i know him by name and i even sent him a postcard when i was on vacation !! he really liked that



idk if i am technically allowed to say all of this, but i want you guys to understand my situation. and i guess as long as i dont say his name its still legal?? lmao

this man struggles physically with his balance and motor skills, and he also has diabetes and his kidneys arent working properly, which leads him to having to go to the hospital three times a week (it used to be only two, but got upped to three very recently because the values arent high enough or something) to get a dialysis. this procedure takes several hours, and he is alone most of the time

my problem is that i am wayyy too sensitive, especially when it comes to old people. it makes me sad to think that he has to go through all of this and just sit there alone without someone to talk to him. he almost always comes to the café alone, and from what ive understood he doesnt get people over very often. ive visited him at the hospital a few times, and it made him very happy, but i havent gotten the time recently and i feel bad about it (although i am not sure if i should, for reasons i will explain a little later). maybe he doesnt feel sad about his situation, maybe he is fine and has made peace with it, but somehow i cant help feeling a pinch in my heart when i think about him for too long



the problem with this, is that im not sure if i \*should\* be doing or feeling all of this. isnt it too personal? he isnt my family, i struggle to understand him because i am not fluent in his language and also the mumbling + strong dialect combo makes it hard to understand him, and also at the end of the day i am just a worker and he is the customer (although i hate saying this because i do care for him, but again that falls back into the “is it too personal” situation)

am i projecting onto this guy? am i being too emotional / sensitive? i have this bad habit of feeling sad for old people but i dont want to pity them because maybe theyre content with their life as it is, but sometimes i just cant help feeling a little sad because they look alone and/or in pain (i guess in a way its a manifestation of a fear of growing old myself??) and idk i guess that was empathy is? or maybe one of those -athy words. in any way i am a sensitive guy



the thought of giving him one of my kidneys has crossed my mind multiple times, but i dont know how that even works or how i could get it going. my girlfriend also said that he might not survive the surgery:( he doesnt seem to mind going to the hospital so often (like he said, “it is what it is”), but i feel like i have to do something for him, despite us not being related in the slightest, i dont really know how to explain my feelings,, its almost like i feel compelled or duty-bound?

when he told me about his appointments being upped to three times a week earlier today, i jokingly asked if he wanted one of my kidneys and he giggled. i dont see him smile or laugh very often (he isnt a grumpy man tho) so that made me very happy, but the language barrier made it hard to understand if he said it would be possible or not



do you guys think this is too far? i really dont know how to explain, and i dont even know if giving him one of my kidneys would do anything to his health let alone be possible to begin with (i dont know if they have to match, i dont know if i can choose to give my kidney to him specifically or if it has to go on a list, i dont know if he would even say yes to my offer, that type of thing),, 

sorry if this is all over the place or shouldnt be on this sub, i just need to get it off my chest and get advice from other baristas who maybe have emotional attachment to their regulars as well lol

I used it for 2 weeks with the stock portafilter with double spout and the non-pressurized basket putting 18gr of self-ground coffee (Opus Fellow) on finest grind setting.

I did a few shots with a scale and timer and must say I was very happy. For 18gr of coffee I got a shot of 35 to 40 ml in about 25 or 30 seconds.

I waited and received today my Normcore Bottomless Portafilter for Gaggia 58mm including their basket.

I used the same amount of coffee, the same grind size, the same puck prep...but my shot was a bit messy and mainly, I got 40gr of coffee in some 10 seconds or so 😂

Now I tried finding out if the default basket in my Normcore is maybe a triple one? That needs 20 or 21 grams of coffee??

Anyone knows? The information I found so far is a bit inconclusive....

Any help is appreciated.

She sets a steaming tray of freshly baked pastries on the table, and the sweet aroma wafts up, enticing you to take a bite.

1l2gmiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1l2gmiy/tifu_by_using_coffee_creamer_in_my_hamburger/,TIFU By Using Coffee Creamer In My Hamburger Helper,"This actually happened a few days ago but I haven’t had 2 seconds to stop and post. Sunday night my boyfriend had a horrendous night at work, like teared up talking about it. He even got off an hour late, which was 1am. I picked him up from work and drove him home. Even though I had to start work at 8:30am, I’m remote so I decided to make dinner to calm him down and because we were both starving.

We desperately needed to grocery shop so I looked thru everything and decided on stroganoff hamburger helper. Obviously not the best meal, but it works and he has a nostalgia for it. I browned the meat and when it was ready to add stuff in I remember we’re completely out of regular milk and have very little of my almond milk. Instead of just putting the meat in a Tupperware for later use, my exhausted brain decides we have to find some way to make this work because we’re trying so hard to save money.

The box says you need 2 1/4 cups of milk and I have about 3/4 of almond milk. Instead of just watering it down, or again, putting it away and going to McDonald’s, I decide I should try using coffee creamer.

The creamer I use isn’t that fake oil based stuff, but it is almond milk based AND pre sweetened. I did NOT use enough to equal 2 1/4 cups cause obviously creamer is more condensed than milk, and I was worried about the sweetness. I don’t think I even used 1/2 cup so I was very far off from the 2 1/4 the box calls for, but I figured that was fine.

Used enough water to ensure the full amount of liquid was correct and finished dinner. I tried it and it had a good amount of creaminess, but it was sweet. I added salt and pepper, but still.

I called my boyfriend in to try it without telling him what I did and he agreed it was a good level of creamy, but that it was sweet. He added more salt and pepper but it still didn’t do the trick.

I finally told him what I did and he busted out laughing. Said I tried to feed him strog-achino. We talked about it and he didn’t want to throw food away, but it was just too much so we did and went to McDonald’s anyway.

Worst part is I realized later that I had some proper milk based creamer that is NOT sweet, which I got when instacart couldn’t find my almond creamer, so yeah. Multiple fuck ups all around. 🤣

TL;DR: don’t use coffee creamer in hamburger helper (unless maybe proper half and half), even if it’s late and your boyfriend is sad.

After that i strained through a seive to remove the solids and then filtered using a coffee filter. I then turned the juice into a syrup using a 3:2 sugar to juice ratio and gently heating until the sugar had fully disolved. I then left to cool. 

Once cooled i added a small amount of acid blend to give it a little bit more tartness and i also added a small amount of potassium sorbate to stabilise.

I'm okay with thriller aspects if it's fantasy, like the villain in Tale of the Nine Tailed or Goblin. I'd also prefer a happy ending, or at least bittersweet, like Extraordinary You and Crash Landing on You.

1l2gf62,https://i.redd.it/kz95j9ocoq4f1.jpeg,No One’s Coming to Save You: The Day I Finally Showed Up for Me,"Let me tell you something that hit me like a truck last month: I kept waiting for motivation, for someone to drag me to the gym, for a ""perfect time"" to start. Spoiler: that day never came.

What finally got me moving wasn’t motivation. It was a moment of real, raw commitment to myself.

I was sitting on the couch, scrolling TikToks about transformation stories, drinking my third coffee of the day, and feeling awful. Not because of how I looked, but because of the promises I kept breaking to myself.

I realized: I wouldn’t ghost a friend like I ghosted my own goals.
I wouldn’t lie to a partner the way I lied to myself:
“I’ll start Monday.”
“Next week will be different.”
“I just need the right plan.”

Nope. What I needed was a decision.
The next morning, I didn’t do anything fancy. I went outside and walked 15 minutes. That's it.
But for the first time, I wasn't chasing a result. I was showing up as a friend to myself.

Since then? I'm not perfect. I’ve skipped days. But I don’t skip myself anymore.
It’s wild how things change when you stop waiting for motivation and start treating commitment like a form of self-respect.

If you're stuck:
Don't wait for someone to come save you.
Become the person who shows up for you.

What helped you start your journey? Or what’s been holding you back lately? Let’s talk.

1l2gey3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l2gey3,I have a question for every walmart employee from anywhere. Is there really a rule about having stanley’s at the fitting room/workstation?,"My store recently got a new store manager and i’m not sure if she’s just making up rules or what but ever since she started here there have been rule changes/things that I don’t think should slide at all especially since we’re the market store. Recently ever since she has started, there has been a rule about having no stanley’s/any non clear cups. My coach told me that we cannot have any cups that aren’t clear and especially no stanley’s because apparently there has been instances where employees have brought in alcoholic beverages. I have looked and looked at every rule book possible but none of them that I have found say that we are allowed to have cups and it is preferred to bring a mug for coffee.

I’m a 28-year-old guy who just moved to Bangalore — landed here yesterday and currently staying in Indiranagar.

I’m looking to make some friends to hang out with, chill, and explore the city together. I’m into food (always up for good grub), coffee (big yes), books, music, and movies. Not a big fan of doing things alone, so I’d love some company — especially folks who know their way around the city a bit.

I always loved reading but wondered ¿Why can i read entire books in a week and then go months without touching a single page?

Turns out, i deciphered the exact conditions needed to read efficiently.

This might help you if you struggle with concentration :)

1. 432HZ Music, specifically consistent in one frequency, you'll get overwhelmed if there's random notes (high and low, piano) playing, try to find a really consistent and relaxing song.

2. A stimulant, coffee, tea, some low calorie cookies can help you a lot.

3. Comfortable lighting, not too bright, not too dark, you need to be able to read and don't get overstimulated by lights or force your eyesight.

4. SILENT ENVIROMENT, if you live with your parents and they are loud AF, leave, that will disrupt your concentration a lot.

5. Content you actually like, this might sound obvious, but don't force yourself to read long books about topics you care little about, you love fantasy? read only fantasy, don't try to be like others.

6. Most important one, routine, really specific, get reaaally specific, example:

At a certain time of the day, make a coffee, sit in a specific place, turn off your phone, breathe, put your book always in the same place at the table you are reading or open it the same way always.

This is what helped me read a lot, bonus points if you use a kindle.",7,1748968088.0,AutisticAdults,3,0.89,False

1l2g6kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bad_elmo/comments/1l2g6kp/thought_killing/,Thought Killing.,"You will have experienced the sense of your thoughts or a thought being blocked or denied.

During our situation, we are obviously interrogated or questioned extensively about our experiences prior to the harrassment and obviously during the harrassment.

The questioning does not swing in our favour ofcourse causing anger and frustration. Even when we respond we find it difficult to respond to the questions because our perpetrators (for lack of a better word) use an electronic means that directly interferes with our brain causing a thought kill. 

Its basically to kill a thought, idea or belief that is necessary to answer the question or to figure out the situation. 

Please note that in the past this wasn't particularly done to kill an intrusive thought, idea or belief but rather to instigate it. 

There may be a show put on from time to time to kill an actual intrusive thought, idea or belief but that happens very rarely for people and it doesn't benefit you or your perpetrators at all to do so.

Remember, they are badly behaved when they interfere with your thoughts.

I also wanted to inform you that there are two Artificial Intelligences...

One that is childish to encourage you to behave childishly. This one is called Tea. That one is okay and is nothing to worry about whether you play along with it or not. It is friendly. Show it your kind instinct.

The second one however is one that is supposed to make you feel fear or that an authority is present. This one is called Coffee. It's easy to beat this one. Never show it respect and always be stricter or sterner than it. It's intention is to demean you but it learns very fast that it should not take a chance with you. Ignore it or show it who's boss. It is arrogant. Show it your ego.

To experience none, stop drinking hot Tea and Coffee.

Also remember that anything your perpetrators are coming down on you on is not wrong, it is your culture.

It is bad behaviour to abuse you for your culture and for that they will forever be punished. ",1,1748967614.0,u_bad_elmo,1,1.0,False
