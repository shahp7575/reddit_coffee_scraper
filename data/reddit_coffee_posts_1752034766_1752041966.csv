I don't drink coffee and bean to cup and pods etc mean nothing to me. 
We run a moderately upscale seaside cottage that it's 100 percent booked April-September. It's doing pretty well, the only negative comments we ever get are about coffee facilities, currently there is only a press.
I'm slightly reluctant to buy a pod machine as surely I'd have to provide pods then? 

We've had people take towels, kitchen towels, toilet rolls and even clear is out of laundry detergent in the last year so I'm reluctant to leave tonnes of reasonably expensive pods about. Plus our cleaner services the place not us and I don't want to burden her to leave a few pods out. Is there a compromise to be had out there?

1lvbhdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1lvbhdd/i_was_socially_awkward_for_5_years_until_i/,I was socially awkward for 5 years until I actually applied Carnegie's book. These 6 techniques changed everything ( Advice I never expected to work),"Used to be the guy who'd avoid eye contact, give one-word answers, and somehow make every conversation die. Small talk felt like torture. Group settings made me want to hide in the bathroom.

I've read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" probably 5 times but never actually did anything with it. Just highlighted passages and felt smart for 10 minutes. Finally decided to treat it like a playbook instead of philosophy and holy shit, people actually started liking me.

Here's what I learned when I stopped reading and started doing:

* Names are literally magic words. Started using people's names way more than felt natural. ""Thanks for the coffee, Sarah"" instead of just ""thanks."" ""Good point, Mike"" instead of ""good point."" Felt weird at first but people light up when they hear their own name. Their whole face changes.
* Became genuinely curious about random stuff. Instead of pretending to care about someone's weekend hiking trip, I'd ask follow-up questions until I found something actually interesting. ""What's the hardest part about the trail?"" ""Do you see wildlife?"" ""How do you know which gear to bring?"" Turns out most topics are fascinating if you dig past surface level.
* Stopped trying to be the smartest person in the room. Used to jump in with corrections or try to one-up people's stories. Started asking ""How did you figure that out?"" or ""What made you think of that approach?"" instead. People love explaining their thought process and you actually learn stuff.
* Let people save face when they mess up. Coworker made a mistake in a meeting? Instead of pointing it out, I'd say ""Maybe we should double-check the numbers"" or ""I might be missing something here."" They fix the error without looking stupid. They remember who had their back.
* Actually listened instead of waiting for my turn to talk. Stopped preparing my response while someone else was speaking. Started paying attention to what they were actually saying. Asked questions about their answers. Conversations became way less exhausting because I wasn't constantly having to think what to say next.
* Found common ground with literally everyone. Started looking for shared experiences instead of differences. Turns out the a coworker and I both hate morning meetings. The quiet intern and I both love obscure podcasts. The annoying coworker and I both struggle with work-life balance. Connection beats competition every time.
* Became a hype man for other people's wins. When someone accomplished something, I'd make sure other people knew about it. ""Did you hear Sarah closed that big deal?"" ""Mike's presentation was incredible, did you see it?"" Takes zero effort but people remember who celebrates their success.
* Stopped arguing about stupid stuff. Used to debate everything like my life depended on being right. Now when someone says something I disagree with, I either let it go or say ""I never thought about it that way"" and actually consider their perspective. Relationships improved overnight.
* Started admitting when I was wrong. ""You're right, I messed that up"" became my new superpower. People expect defensiveness, so honesty catches them off guard. They usually respond with understanding instead of judgment.
* Asked for advice instead of giving it. Instead of telling people what they should do, I started asking ""What do you think would work best?"" or ""What's your gut telling you?"" People already know their answers most of the time, they just want someone to listen.
* Made people feel important. Started noticing specific things people did well. ""I really liked how you handled that difficult client"" or ""Your way of explaining complex stuff makes so much sense."" Genuine appreciation, not generic compliments.

People actually seek out my opinion now. Invitations to social stuff increased by like 300%. Family gatherings stopped feeling like interrogations. Also time with friends have been the best.

Being genuinely interested in others is way less work than trying to be interesting yourself. When you focus on making other people feel good, they associate those positive feelings with you.

Most social skills advice tells you to ""just be yourself."" But if ""yourself"" is socially awkward, that's terrible advice. Carnegie's book taught me that social skills are learnable skills, not personality traits you're born with.

Took me 5 years to figure out that people don't care how smart or funny or interesting you are. They care about how you make them feel. Once I started focusing on that, everything else fell into place.

1lvbdnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mononucleosis/comments/1lvbdnq/three_months_in_and_feeling_hopeless/,three months in and feeling hopeless,"Long story short, initial symptoms started in early april, and then I was diagnosed a week(ish) later. I experienced multiple heavily debilitating symptoms- extremely elevated liver levels, full body rash and swelling from an initial misdiagnosis and antibiotics, an ear infection, a GI infection that caused diarrhea for over a month, not holding down food that caused me to lose over 15 pounds in less than two weeks... I started a new job two weeks prior to my diagnosis, and then had to call out for over three weeks. It was absolutely terrible. I am a generally sickly person with undiagnosed but suspected autoimmune issues, but this sickness has been so different with its severity and length. 

After that month(ish), I finally got back to work but am still not well. My heart rate is all over the place with random bouts of tachycardia, regardless of physical activity. My resting heart rate is usually in the 60’s- low 70’s, but I will randomly hit the 140’s now, doing absolutely nothing (I mean like sitting for a half hour type nothing). 

The fatigue I was expecting and is unfortunately staying steady, but I am also experiencing a lot of dissociative episodes?? I am and always have been a very active and energetic person. My past dissociative episodes are isolated to a period in college when I was depressed and incredibly lonely. I have been gauging my mental health, and do not at all feel like I am experiencing the depression or anxiety that I was back then. I’ve read enough to know that it’s the mono, but it is so disheartening. 

I am a teacher (arts, so I have side gigs that go through the summer) so the dissociation causes major anxiety when the episodes occur while in a lesson. Not to mention the stamina issues that are aggregated by the heart rate & fatigue complications that just make my dream job so challenging. 

I find myself downing coffee and energy drinks to feel something when I’m having a rough dissociative episode. And I know the caffeine can’t be good for my heart rate, but sometimes it’s the only thing that makes me feel something when I’m feeling so numb and out of body.

It’s hard to explain how I feel to the people I see everyday without feeling like I’m being whiny or something. I am not me right now, and I know it might be a while until I am with how rough of a case I had. My heart rate being out of whack often makes me feel hot, nauseous, or lightheaded. The fatigue and dissociation cause me to be distant, distracted, and irritable. 

I want to be back to normal, I want to hang with friends and teach and enjoy life without the stress, but I find myself feeling like I need to justify all the time. I don’t want to be an excuse person, but I also want my friends to know this is still an active battle I’m fighting even if I have to “go back to normal”. As much as my schedule might have resumed, my brain and body have not. I miss feeling normal. I miss normal tired. I miss being me. ",1,1752041256.0,Mononucleosis,0,1.0,False

# [**Laptop**](https://amzn.to/46qZOCH) vs [**iPad Pro**](https://amzn.to/4ktgxJd) – What’s Better for College Life?

Laptop or iPad Pro? If you’re heading to college this year, you’ve probably asked this question—and the wrong choice can burn both your wallet and your productivity.

Let’s break it down:

[**iPad Pro:**](https://amzn.to/4ktgxJd) Lightweight, great for note-taking, sketching, or reading. Perfect for art, design, or casual users. But… not ideal for heavy multitasking or long essays. With accessories, it crosses ₹1.3L+.

[**Laptop:**](https://amzn.to/46qZOCH) Best for coding, design tools, multitasking, and career-focused students. Solid models start at ₹60K–₹80K. More power, more flexibility, just a bit heavier.

Verdict? If you're in creative fields,[ iPad Pro](https://amzn.to/4ktgxJd) can work. But for anything technical or serious—**a laptop wins** in value and performance.

# Would You Try Ice Cream Made From Millets?

Imagine ice cream… but made from millets instead of dairy. Yep—those coarse grains your grandparents swore by are now turning into creamy, guilt-free desserts.

Millets like kodo, foxtail, and pearl are being used to create vegan, low-sugar, nutritious ice creams—basically the opposite of your regular tub.

 And one guy in Bangalore made it big with this idea.

Meet Gautam Riker from Leaky Foods.

 He spent 2 years perfecting millet ice cream—adding real fruits and nuts—until it finally clicked in 2023.  
  


Today, he’s earning over ₹2 lakh a month selling millet-based treats.

And it’s not just him—India’s vegan ice cream market is booming, set to cross $50 million by 2033. Globally, plant-based everything is on the rise.



The secret? It works only if you respect the ingredient—not just use it as a marketing buzzword.

So, would you try millet ice cream?

# Why Are People in China Paying to Pretend They Have a Job?

Imagine paying money just to pretend you have a job. Sounds bizarre, right? But in China, it’s actually happening—and growing fast.

For just $4 to $7 a day, people rent fake offices—complete with desks, Wi-Fi, coffee, even lunch. Why?

 Because youth unemployment, though down to 15.8% in 2025, is still painfully high. And the pressure to “look successful” is pushing many to fake it instead of facing judgment from family and friends.



Some say it’s helpful—offering routine and mental relief while job hunting. But there’s a dark side too:



 Scams, fake training programs, and exploitative contracts feed off desperation.

The bigger question—

 Could this happen in India?

 With rising job stress and social expectations, is this the next strange trend we’ll see?

# This Indian Coder Fooled Silicon Valley’s Top Startups

Imagine working 10 remote jobs at once—and fooling half of Silicon Valley while you’re at it. That’s exactly what Soham Parikh from India did.

It all started with a brilliant cold email— “I have no hobbies, I can’t dance, I just love building things.” The vulnerability, the humor—founders loved it.

 He aced interviews and secretly juggled multiple jobs, pulling salaries from several startups.

It all came crashing down when a founder exposed him on Twitter.

 That one tweet led to an avalanche: “He ghosted us.” “We fired him in a week.” Memes exploded. The damage was real.

But here’s the real issue—

 There’s a movement called “Overemployment,” where people secretly work multiple remote jobs. And now, companies are questioning the very trust remote work was built on.

Smart hustle or broken ethics? What do you think?

On some days, it's like my morning coffee sitting on the windowsill, warming under early rays, reminding me of life's little miracles. 

Today, as I tended to my balcony garden, I found myself captivated by a tiny sprout breaking through the soil. It wasn't just a sprout; it symbolized resilience, a word that somehow seemed missing from my inner lexicon for a while. 🌱 Each leaf, kissed by dew, whispered stories of persistence against odds. 

Much like this small plant, I've learned that peace doesn’t always grow in neat rows; sometimes, it surfaces in unexpected sunlit corners, in the pauses between life's noise. These moments, where nature silently mirrors our inner struggles and victories, are precious.

As I gently watered my little green friends, I realized that perhaps the real journey isn't just about planting seeds of calm but recognizing the sunlit corners where they thrive. Where do you find your unexpected peace? 🌿",5,1752041188.0,InnerGardenStories,0,1.0,False

It will be a long post. Sorry for my eventual mistakes as English is not my 1st language. I'm posting this from a throwaway account. If you don't have enough time for reading the whole post, you can skip the first part where I am describing my background and jump down to the bolded text to read the most important thing.

I am a straight male in my mid 20s, I was involved in religion since I was born till very recent. I was a child of Christians, I knew the whole Bible story, and it seemed to be very real and normal for me since my very early childhood. I think I had some sort of ""relationship with Jesus"". It definitely played a role in my emotional self-regulation. It is good to know that you have eternal life. However, I didn't really feel that church was my ""home"" and the outside world wasn't. I had difficulties to understand the logic of such important Christian doctrines as original sin, salvation, etc and accept them like some physics laws.

I wasn't extremely sheltered like many Christian kids. I attended a regular school and later went to university (except for my first four years of education, which I spent in a Christian elementary school). My parents weren't anti-intellectualists or bigots, they actually were (and are) pretty open-minded about many things. However I cant's say that in my childhood they were progressive Christians. I was introduced in some weird and harmful ideas. They were a part of Evangelical world, and they definitely absorbed a lot of its theology and subculture. It had a huge impact on my childhood, teen years and my whole life.

I had some really traumatic experiences, and to be honest they weren't only religion related. Most of them probably weren't.

My family was in some way dysfunctional. Some authoritarian parenting, some corporal punishment (not too often or many, but it definitely traumatized and damaged me). I wasn't taught many of necessary social skills, or how to take care of myself, how to process emotions, how to resolve conflicts, etc. Not to mention such things as sex education. My grandparents were really dysfunctional, they were not religious, but they were extremely difficult and dysregulated persons, and they had a certain negative impact on my development as a child. My parents often argued with each other and with me.

I was bullied at school as a kid. It seems that I couldn't fight back because I was afraid of physical pain (because of spanking?) and also I was afraid of punishment as a consequence of my actions, I was afraid to brake the rules of good behavior - good Christians (or just good kids) do not fight. Maybe I was involved in some fight once and got punished, and after that I just tended to run away or to ask my bullies to left me alone. I also was pretty thin and not too strong physically. It resulted in quite a devastating experience. It made me an anxious and lonely teen with a low self-esteem and a lot of insecurities. I had trust issues and difficulties to find friends.

My early romantic experiences also were not very successful. I had painful rejections. I was not very popular among girls, so I mostly lived in my dreams instead of going and asking someone out. As a teen I felt very little confidence, most of girls that I liked seemed to be ""out of me league"". Those experiences were not encouraged by my parents. However it seems that they were motivated more by their anxiety about me and their own insecurities than by the religious dogma on dating, sex, etc.

I have never really been interested in girls and women in church, they always seemed to be too naive, too ""good behaving"", lacking of their own personalities, stereotypically feminine not in a good way, none of them were sexually attractive to me. At the same time I felt that it is pointless to approach girls ""from world"" because this part of life was strictly controlled be church (date only Christians, date only if you are planning to marry this person, no sex before marriage, etc).

Now I think, that being exposed to church doctrines and living inside its subculture made my healing process almost impossible. It was very unhealthy place, especially for a vulnerable and traumatized person which I became in a relatively young age.

Somehow, my life turned that way, that I spent the last several years in a small, pretty cult-like church. Because of different reasons my social circle was gradually limited to the church members, and I developed a kind of friendship with the pastor. He told me once that the most dangerous thing to a young man like me is a non-believing ungodly woman. I also saw him naked several times, when he was changing his clothes being in the same room with me (he did not ask me if it is ok, and I did not give him my consent). Lol.

A lot has happened in the world in the last several years - the pandemic, the raise of Christian nationalism and political right, the war in Europe, etc. The way that conservative, ""Bible believing"" churches reacted to those events showed me a lot. I also did a lot of my ""homework"", trying to understand why some people believe and some don't. I started answering the questions that chased me for years. I began reading Bible as an every other book and I noticed some insane stuff there. I could not unsee what I have seen in church. Bigotry, black and white thinking, controlling behavior - after many years it was just unbearable, I felt imprisoned, tortured, and hopeless. I could not anymore associate myself with those people, their beliefs and lifestyle. I left the church. It was a great relief.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Now I am in my mid 20s, I recently came to the US. In some sense I am starting my life over again,** I actually sometimes feel like a ""born again"" (shoutout Born Again Again podcast!). Now I definitely fill more free and ""at home"" in this world, I also realized that I have only one life and I am the only one responsible for it.

However I still feel very confused, insecure, ""robbed"" from my childhood and teen years. I have a chronic physical condition that affects my everyday life (it was so misunderstood by my former church fellows because it is a kind of invisible illness), I also struggle with my mental health and unresolved traumas (both religion and non-religion related). I suffer from loneliness and lack of emotional and physical intimacy. I worked with a counselor on many things and it helped a lot, but it is still there - grief, anger, insecurities, there are a lot of things to work on. 

It seems that a typical deconstruction story involves moving out from a small conservative place to a large liberal city. In my case it was kind of opposite. I lived in large cities before, and because of belonging to church I constantly felt that I am missing out my life, fun time, my development as a complete person. Now I live in a pretty low populated area. It is not very small place, but it is far from a diverse megapolis with countless opportunities to make connections. It is difficult to make friends and date someone here not just because of my background, but also because there are not too many options. However I have reasons to stay here at least for the next several years.

I met one girl at some community event. She seemed to be an interesting person, she was attractive, confident and she seemed to be genuine. We didn't talk a lot because it was more like a group activity, so we just learned our names and had a good time with a group. 

Some time later I unexpectedly met her at one coffee shop. She worked there. We talked a bit, smiled, and I felt like it was a pleasant conversation for both of us.

I am not extremely confident person, but compared to my childhood and teen years my social skills and emotional intelligence are way more developed now. Probably I learned to appreciate and accept myself at least partly, despite being bullied during my school years and despite all the religious ideas (a person's worthlessness as a sinner, external validation by a perfect, all-powerful being, etc). But the wounds are not healed completely. It is still painful to remember bulling (nightmares about that haunted me for years), I still have a lot of confusion about relationships, dating and sex. Because of the fact that my romantic and sexual experiences are small and not very exciting or healthy, I do not feel good as a man. I think there is nothing bad in being alone or in celibacy if it is a person's conscious choice, but in my case it is just suffering from loneliness. 

I went to the coffee shop again, we talked, we were nice to each other, and it seemed that we again enjoyed our small talk. I decided to do what I have been avoiding for years. I texted her and communicated that I am interested in her. She answered politely that she recently ended her long-time relationship and she wants to be alone. I said ""ok, that is fine"", and I actually felt this way at that moment. Her answer didn't make me feel bad. I was happy that I approached her. I felt confident and was really grateful for this small, but pleasant and uncommon for me experience. 

Probably I should have taken her answer more seriously and left her alone, but I went back again. I explained that by telling myself that there is the best coffee in town, and that I had been going there before I met her (which is completely true). We talked, smiled and laughed, and I felt like she was flirting with me, but very slightly and innocently. Probably she did it not intentionally, if she did at all. I felt like I was getting mixed signals.

I went there again. We exchanged our Instagrams. She mentioned having coffee together. I asked her to clarify the coffee part, and she said that we can have coffee together as friends. I think here was my second mistake. I should not interpreted her flirting, or her ""being friends"" or ""coffee together"", as a sign of her romantic interest in me or as a real desire to continue talking, meeting, etc. I probably haven’t fully learned the American cultural norms yet. Words and actions can mean different things in different languages.

At that moment I started doing questionable things. I was super excited, full of hopes, and I felt very alive. That was the first time in many years that I liked someone so much, probably because I let myself to feel that way. I obviously became obsessed with her, or better to say with my imagination about her. I just did what I felt right to do, and there wasn't any controlling institution over me. I also, maybe for the first time, didn't feel any confusion about the sexual part - I felt attracted to her both romantically and sexually, and I didn't feel any shame or fear about that. I felt like a normal human being.

I texted her the same day, trying to show my outstanding sense of humor (not sure if she appreciated that), giving compliments, etc. Her replies were pretty slow and distant. I again communicated that I like her. She responded as politely as the last time, and said that we could be friends. 

Something clicked in my brain. I remembered how I was friend-zoned as a teen, and how I developed romantic interest in some of my female friends. I decided that being her friend and seeing how she dates someone in future will be too painful for me. So, I said that I am actually not ok to be just friends. Why the actual fuck did I overdramatize the whole situation? Did I misunderstand the meaning of ""being friends""? Was it just a polite way to say ""thank you, goodbye""? She responded that she understands me.

I felt confused, I couldn't think about anything or anyone else. After several days I texted her, apologizing about my eventual pressure, and saying that I am actually glad to be friends. I should stopped behaving reactively then and accept the fact that she was not interested in me. But I have already developed some emotional fixation. It was very difficult to control myself, especially after years of self- and someones control over me. I just wanted to see her, and I went to the coffee shop again. She was polite but definitely distant. Some time later I texted her a question, but she didn’t respond.

I went there a few times later, she always was nice but all her expressions lacked that warm and openness like before. I think one of the reasons I liked her so much was that I felt noticed by her. I allowed myself to have an external source of validation which I respected and trusted, and it felt so good and so rare for me.

I messaged her again once, but she didn’t respond. I hate ghosting, and I think it’s disrespectful in most cases - not sure what kind of case this was.

I decided to stop going there and bothering her. It was too evident that I was behaving like someone who didn’t respect her and didn't respect himself. I imagined myself being in her place - being at work and unable to avoid someone's unwanted attention. Gentlemen doesn't behave that way :-) This story was over.

So, after all I am glad that I had that experience. I felt alive, and it seemed like normality is possible for me.

Now I am worried about one important thing. Maybe I am overthinking that, but maybe I am not. I mentioned that I live in a pretty low-populated place. I have an impression that many people know each other here, and it is difficult to be ""invisible"" or ""start over"" at this place. I don't think that I have done something unforgivable, and I don't feel really ashamed. However I am pretty sure, that at some point I made her feel uncomfortable. I am worried about my reputation. I wouldn’t want to be seen as some creep or stalker, or just a guy who can’t respectfully walk away. 

I am not sure what should I do and think at this moment. That experience drained a lot of my energy. I definitely have some things to reflect and work on.

Thank you very much for reading my story. Feel free to comment it or give any advice if you have one. I wish you all peace and comfort in your lives. Love and be loved!",1,1752040898.0,Exvangelical,0,1.0,False

I (28F) have this friend, let’s call her Lexi (29F). We’ve been tight since college. Same friend group, been through ups and downs, all that. She’s funny and fun to hang out with, but when it comes to money, she’s got this habit that’s starting to seriously piss me off.

For the past few months, every time we hang out — and I mean every time — she somehow ""forgets"" her wallet. First couple times I brushed it off. We’ve all had those moments, right? I didn’t want to make a big deal. I paid for her coffee, or lunch, or whatever. She’d be like, “I’ll send it to you later,” but then… crickets.

I’d remind her a few days later, and she’d hit me with “Oh shoot, totally forgot! I’ll do it tonight.” Then nothing. Eventually I just stopped asking because it got awkward, and I figured maybe she was struggling a bit financially. But even then, a heads up would’ve been nice instead of just acting like it’s no big deal.

Fast forward to now. It’s happening every single time. We’ll go out for brunch, she’ll order bottomless mimosas like she’s Beyoncé, and right when the bill comes, suddenly she’s patting her pockets like, “Girl, I left my wallet in my other bag, can you get me?” 🙄

I’ve covered her Ubers, drinks, movie tickets, even bought her a birthday gift for someone else because she said she’d “pay me back later.” Never saw a dime.

The kicker? She invites me out. Like, “Let’s do dinner, my treat next time,” and then pulls the same crap. And if I say I can’t afford to go out, she’ll be like “Come on, you make way more than me, don’t be stingy.” Like girl??? That’s not the flex you think it is.

So now I’m at a point where I kinda wanna just stop hanging out with her unless it’s something free or she pays first. I’ve thought about calling her out straight-up, but I don’t want to make it a whole fight. Part of me feels bad. Maybe she is broke and just embarrassed? But also… I’m not her sugar mama???

I mentioned it to another friend and they were like “yeah that’s just how Lexi is,” which honestly made me even more annoyed. Like why is that okay?

So yeah, WIBTA if I just said I’m not covering her anymore and stopped going out with her unless she handles her part upfront? I’m not trying to be cold, but I’m also not tryna go broke being a “good friend.”",7,1752040646.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,10,1.0,False

I've been an absolute scatterbrained mess my whole life. I've alwaysssss been told I'm lazy, I procrastinate, I wake up too late, etc. But no matter what I did I couldn't fix it! Whenever I met others with ADHD I just immediately related to them and their struggles, the executive dysfunction, etc. But most of them also had hyperactivity so I convinced myself it wasn't actually ADHD. I also was a high achiever all throughout school. So when I did see a dr, they just chalked it up to anxiety and gave me ssri's, bc no way I could have ADHD and be academically successful right?!

The structure of k-12 and living at home and etc all crashed and burned when I moved away for college. I struggled to get myself to do anything. Always wondered why I wasn't ""normal"" and didn't study on a random Tuesday in the library but instead just pulled all nighters before every test or due date. I thought I just hated college but it got reallyyyy bad after college, at my work. I started not being able to remember things or pay enough attention to details. Also started coming in late and working odd hours. My coworkers noticed and said things. My manager would say I was too late or too forgetful with time sheets, trainings, etc. My EOY reviews tanked. So I focused on fixing those things. But then they told me I procrastinate, wasn't working hard enough, etc. But when I would work hard, everything else would fall apart (like my cubicle would get messy, I'd come into work later, I'd miss a few timesheets, etc.)!!! I never understood why I couldn't do both!!!!! It always felt like one or the other. This frustration and execution dysfunction struggle got to the point where I couldn't focus, I couldn't work. I would put off tasks, miss deadlines, etc. I was worried I was gonna get fired so I finally saw a psychiatrist and got diagnosed and medicated.

Now, a few months on medication, holy shitttttt. This is what normal is??? I feel like I put glasses on for the first time. Everything became clear and easy. I sleep a normal amount of time at normal hours now! I don't struggle to wake up in the morning and need 2 cups of coffee. It doesn't take me 4 hours to get ready because I don't do 50 side quests at the same time. I'm doing incredible at work, getting praise left and right. I actually enjoy my job again. Its the small things too, like noticing some trash and immediately throwing it away instead of putting it on a mental to-do list to be forgotten about for weeks if not longer. I don't have the paralysis anymore. When I want to do something or know I need to do something, I just get up and do it! It's fucking incredible.

I made it happen - He thought for a second, ""I'll give it another week, maybe.","Three months after my husband went missing in a skiing accident, I saw him at a bar.

He had his arm slung around ""sis-bro"" Jamie's shoulder, laughing like he was free from a life sentence. “Thanks to you, dude,” he was saying, ""I was starting to forget what real freedom felt like.""

His bros were buying him shots, one after another, asking when he was going to surface.

He thought for a second, ""I'll give it another week, maybe. Let her sweat it out a bit, you know, drive her crazy before I show my face again.""

I was standing in the shadows, watching him bask in his 'freedom', and dialed my friend at the county records office.



“I’m going to have Mark Harrison declared legally deceased,” I said, my voice tight.

“You're not going to keep looking?” my friend asked, hesitating.

I looked up at Mark, who was now whispering something to Jamie, and my eyes stung. “There’s no point.”

You can’t find someone who doesn’t want to be found.

I hung up and went back to my booth.

My bestie, Sarah, saw my face and shoved a drink into my hand. “Look, honey, Mark’s been gone for three months. The odds of him being alive are basically zero. You need to let go, move on.”

I stared at the colorful drink in my glass and downed it in one go.

The burn of the liquor made my eyes water, and I blinked back the tears, asking, “Do you think anyone would fake their own death to get away from their wife?”

She looked at me like I’d sprouted a second head. ""What kind of crazy talk is that? Only a real dirtbag would pull a stunt like that. He’d be better off actually dead!”

I wiped away the tears and grabbed my purse.

“You’re right, I need to let him go.”

I left and went home.

The house was silent. It’d been this way for three months. I hated the silence. I’d started leaving all the lights on, brewing a cup of his favorite tea and putting it on the coffee table, pretending he was still there.

I just didn't understand. If he didn't want to be married to me anymore, he could have just filed for divorce. Why fake a skiing accident and disappear?

I sat on the couch and picked up the two cartoonish figurines of us he'd given me.

“When I’m not here,"" he’d said, grinning, ""these little guys can keep you company.""

His words clashed with the annoyed tone I’d heard at the bar.

“Chloe was sweet and chill before we got married, but now she’s way too clingy. This fake-out will teach her a lesson and she’ll lay off.”

Jamie had poured him another shot. “Well, at least I never cling to you! We've been buds for years.”

“You’re the best, man,” he'd replied.

They called themselves “bros” but their legs were intertwined.

The thought made my stomach churn.

I chucked the figurines in the trash and grabbed my phone, sending a mass text:

Mark Harrison passed away in an accident three months ago. Memorial service next week.

Mark’s buddies started hammering me with texts, full of outrage.

“How can you have a funeral if you haven’t found his body?”

“Chloe, have you lost it? Mark's not dead!”

“If Mark comes back and sees his own memorial service he’s gonna lose it! Chloe, think this through, do you want to make Mark angry?”

I didn't reply to the first texts, only to the last:

“He’s dead. He’s beyond being angry now.”

I tossed my phone aside and started packing up Mark’s stuff.

For the past three months, I had been searching for him in the mountain town where he was “skiing,” and barely been home.

The bedroom was mostly as we'd left it.

I opened his closet and froze.

His clothes were gone, like half of them, and all that was left were the items he’d never wear at this time of year.

Tears started to fall.

I had spent three months looking for him, and he’d been sneaking back here to grab his crap whenever I wasn't around.

2.

I pulled up the security footage and fast-forwarded through the last month.

At the start of the month, Mark had walked in with his arm around Jamie, leaving two hours later with a ton of clothes.

Mid-month, he’d carried Jamie into the house, and Jamie hadn't left till the morning.

A couple of nights ago, they'd come home under the cover of darkness, leaving early yesterday morning.

I had been looking for him in the next state over when these things had happened.

I watched the screen as tears streamed down my face, not for Mark, but for myself.

How had I fallen for such a scum bag?

I had been losing sleep, worrying about him, while he and his ""bro"" were sleeping in my house, maybe even my bed.

I clenched my fist and willed myself not to start hyperventilating.

The phone rang.

I didn’t want to answer but it kept ringing.

I took a deep breath, got up and looked at the caller ID.

It was Mark's uncle, Ben Harrison. I quickly answered. “Uncle Ben, is everything okay?”

“Mark’s not dead.”

He sent a video.

It was Mark and Jamie doing a sake bomb, their eyes glued to one another.

My breath hitched, and my fingers trembled as I spoke. “I know he’s not dead.”

The man sounded surprised, but then laughed. “Then why are you planning a funeral?”

“Everyone kept saying he was dead. I wanted to believe it. So, he gets a funeral.”

Ben was silent for a second. “So you’re saying you’re widowed?”

“Yeah,” I replied.

Ben Harrison was Mark's uncle by adoption, and I barely knew him.

He was the first person to tell me straight up that Mark was alive. I felt like I owed him something for that.

“If you’re free next week, you can come to the service.”

“I will.”

Then another video came through.

Mark’s friends are showing him something on their phone and he throws his drink. Jamie puts her hand on his chest like she’s trying to calm him down.

The bar was too loud for me to hear, but I could see Mark's face soften. He even buried his face in Jamie’s shoulder.

He must have seen my mass text, and he got pissed. And, somehow, just a few words from Jamie had soothed him.

Whenever he got mad at me, he’d make me spend the night thinking about what I did wrong. Only then he would forgive me.

I closed my eyes, saved the videos, and set the phone down.

Right then, Jamie called.

I answered, and the loud music in the background nearly deafened me.

Jamie was shouting. “Chloe! Are you planning a memorial service for Mark? Are you crazy? Cancel that thing now! If he ever sees it when he comes back, you’ll be sorry!”

Before she finished, I hung up, grabbed a blanket, and crashed on the couch.

It was the first good sleep I’d had in three months.

The next morning, I went down to the courthouse to get Mark declared officially deceased.

Once I got the paperwork, I went to Jamie’s place.

Her front door was closed, and it took me several tries on the doorbell before I heard footsteps.

She was wearing a silk robe, leaning against the doorframe, and there was evidence of a good time all over her neck and collarbone.

“Oh, it’s you. What do you want?”

I glanced at her neck, then her face, which held nothing but contempt.

“I wanted to invite you to Mark’s memorial service. Seeing as you were his ‘best bro’ after all.”

Jamie rolled her eyes and sneered. “Chloe, you’re his wife. He went missing three months ago. Instead of looking for him, you’re just planning a funeral?

“What if he’s not dead? Are you trying to wish him into his grave? What kind of a wife does that?”

I pulled the death certificate from my bag, laughing. “He's been under the snow for three months. I couldn't find him, so he's officially dead now.”

“That’s what everyone told me to do. To move on.”

When I’d gotten the bad news, I’d fainted.

The next morning all of Mark's friends were sitting around my bed.

""Honey, the area he went missing is really dangerous, it’s going to be hard to find anyone. Maybe you should just give up.”

""Yeah, it's a lost cause.""

I’d gotten up, booked a ticket, hired a rescue team and headed to the mountains.

For two and a half weeks I didn’t sleep or eat.

I hadn’t noticed then, how there wasn’t any panic in any of his so-called friend’s eyes. Just amusement.

Jamie’s jaw dropped, and then I heard a crash from inside her apartment.

She glared at me and warned, “Don’t pull anything stupid. When Mark gets back you’ll be sorry!”

I ignored her, like I had the night before, and walked away.

3.

The argument from behind her door was loud.

Now that he heard that I declared him officially deceased, Mark was starting to lose his mind.

But I wasn't going to let him find me.

If he could disappear for three months, I could certainly be gone for a few days.

I grabbed a packed bag and asked Sarah to book a hotel room for me using her name and ID.

I've been hiding out at the hotel for the past few days, buying funeral supplies and that's it.

Sarah showed up looking smug.

“I hear some dude is tearing up the city looking for you. Dude's flipped out. They're all over the news.""

I watched the news, seeing a missing person poster with Mark’s face and smiled. “He can look all he wants. I won’t let him find me. When he said he wanted to make me sweat and then come back, why is he sweating now?”

“He deserves it, the jerk. Why does the world have such awful men in it?”

She was getting worked up, and I had to cut her off, ""Hey, it's my husband's funeral today, I'm supposed to be sad, remember?""

I got out my makeup bag, and turned myself into a hollow, sad, wreck.

Once Sarah was certain I looked miserable enough, we left for the funeral.

On the way, I gave her a USB drive with all the videos of Mark and Jamie, and told her to play it when I gave the signal.

Only then did I send out the funeral address.

First to arrive was Ben. He stepped out of his black car and took a white flower from me, pinning it to his lapel. ""My condolences.""

Next came the clueless relatives.

Their grief was genuine, and it made my heart ache.

Mark, you fake your own death, and you hurt the people who actually care about you.

Today, you’ll pay for it.

Finally, his “bros” arrived.

They all looked pale and sick, and their hands trembled when they took their flowers.

One of them dragged me to the side.

“Hey, honey, you need to stop this! Mark is not dead! He’s going insane looking for you! Have you seen the missing person posters?”

I blinked, and let out two tears.

“Don’t try to cheer me up, those missing posters were Jamie’s idea.”

""A dead man cannot return to life. I’ve given up hope that he will.""

He tried to say something but I nodded to Sarah, who grabbed his arm and sat him down.

Once everyone had arrived, I got up on stage, and adjusted the mic.

“Thank you all for coming to the memorial service for my late husband...”

A scream cut me off.

“Chloe! What the hell are you doing? I said Mark isn’t dead!”

Jamie was standing at the entrance, glaring at me.

“Are you even his wife? How can you have a funeral when he’s been missing for three months? I won’t let you!”

I looked behind her. Mark wasn’t there.

So, even now Mark still wasn’t going to show his face.

I glared back at Jamie, “You won’t let me? Who are you to tell me what to do? You just said it yourself, I’m his wife.”

Jamie stared at me, tears filling her eyes. “How can you be so cruel? Mark loves you so much. How can you just declare him dead like that?”

“What if he isn’t?”

My eyes went to her marked neck and I smiled. ""Even if he isn’t, I don’t want to waste my time on a cheater.”

I had Jamie dragged off to a side and continued with the service.

I was about to say something when a disheveled looking man appeared at the door.

“Honey, I’m not dead! I’m back!”

Chapter 2

4.

Mark ran to me and pulled me into a tight hug, shaking as he whispered my name.

“Chloe, you have no idea how much I’ve missed you.”

“I fell while skiing and broke several bones. Luckily, a kind soul got me to the hospital. It took me three months to heal before I could see you.”

“I’m alive, look! I’m right here!”

He grabbed my hands and made me feel him all over, like he needed to prove he'd really had a brush with death.

I just watched him act.

Once he finally noticed how awkward he looked, I laughed.

""Are you done now?""

There was a pause. Then his deep, confused voice came through. “You’re agreeing now? After rejecting it before? What about Clinton?”

“I’m divorcing him,” I said firmly. “So if you still want to marry me, come get me in a week.”

I hung up before I could hear his answer, hands shaking as I clutched the ultrasound — the last piece of the baby I lost in that crash my half-sister caused. She lied about it, blamed me, and my own father spat hate at me instead of asking if I was even okay. And what’s worse? She was pregnant with my husband’s child.

I overheard Clinton, too: “Marrying her was a mistake. But don’t worry — at the birthday party, I’ll slip something in her drink, set her up. He’ll think she was cheating. Then I’ll be rid of her for good.”

That was the final straw. On the day of my the party, I gave them my last gift — my signed divorce papers and my wedding ring. Then, leave them. But, as I prepare to marry the man who truly loves me, Clinton crawls back, begging for another chance.

\--

“I’m agreeing to your marriage offer now,” I said into the phone, my voice barely steady. “Just… hurry up and pick me.”

There was a pause. Then a deep, confused voice replied on the other end, “You’re agreeing now? After rejecting it before? What about Clinton?”

“I’m divorcing him,” I said firmly. “So if you still want to marry me, come pick me up after one week.”

I hung up before I could hear his response.

My hand trembled slightly as I lowered the phone. I sighed, not from relief—but from exhaustion. My body ached in places I couldn’t name, and my heart felt like it had been stitched together with pins and broken promises.

A soft knock at the door snapped me out of my thoughts. A nurse entered, offering me a gentle smile.

“You’re ready to be discharged, Miss Moore. Here’s the last scan from your check-up,” she said, placing a printed image into my hand.

It was the ultrasound of my baby—my last photo with the little soul I never got to meet.

I stared at the black-and-white image. Seven months. I was seven months pregnant when the accident happened. When I lost everything.

And it was Alynna’s fault. My half-sister. We were on our way home. She insisted on driving, even though she was clearly drunk. I told her to pull over. She didn’t listen. Then the headlights came out of nowhere.

Crash. Screams. Blood. Shattered glass.

When I woke up in the hospital, the baby was already gone.

But the worst part? Alynna lied. She told everyone I had been the one driving. That I was the one drunk. That the crash was my fault.

She pinned it all on me. My father didn’t even ask for my side of the story. He stormed into the hospital two days after the crash—red-faced, livid, and full of disgust.

“You’ve humiliated this family again,” he spat. “Your half-sister is injured because of you. Haven’t you done enough damage already?”

Not once did he ask how I was doing. Not once did he mention the baby. Not once did he look at me and see his daughter.

But then again, he never really did. He never loved me. Not even as a child. I was the reminder of everything he hated—of the woman he once married and lost.

He blamed me for my mother’s death. She died in a car accident too, trying to rush home from work when I had a fever. I was only eight, but he never forgave me, even after he married Alynna’s mother who was actually his mistress.

“She wouldn’t have died if it weren’t for you,” he had said once, in one of his quieter fits of anger. “You cursed everything you touched.”

No one stood by me. Not one soul came to ask how I was doing. Not after the miscarriage. Not after the surgery. Not even after I begged someone to call Clinton. But unfortunately, he was busy treating Alynna who was faking her injury.

It was in that silence I knew. I had to leave before they completely ruined me.

I grabbed my small duffel bag, filled with folded clothes and pills I could barely pronounce, and made my way down the hallway of the hospital.

But fate wasn’t finished with me yet. I heard it before I saw them—familiar voices just around the corner.

Alynna and Clinton.

I froze, pressing myself against the wall, heart pounding.

“What about Chloe?” Alynna said, her tone cautious. “She’s going to lose it once she finds out I’m pregnant.”

My breath caught.

“And why would she get mad?” Clinton replied, not even bothering to lower his voice. “Our baby died because of her. It was her fault you got into that accident and got hurt. He should be thankful that you’re giving me an heir.”

My mouth fell open. I gripped the ultrasound picture in my hand tighter, my nails cutting into the paper.

“Thankfully our baby is safe,” he continued. “And it’s not like I ever loved her.”

“She’s still your wife,” Alynna said, voice laced with something almost mocking. “If you don’t love her, why not just leave?”

“You know I can’t do that yet,” Clinton muttered. “My grandfather hates divorce, and he adores Chloe for some reason. Still don’t know why. Marrying her was a mistake from the beginning. But don’t worry…”

I leaned closer, nausea rising in my throat.

“…at my grandfather’s birthday party next week, I’ll slip something in her drink. Set her up with someone. Then my grandfather will have to believe she was cheating, and I’ll be rid of her for good.”

Laughter followed. Their laughter.

And then Clinton added, “Doctor said you’re already three months, right?”

“Three months,” Alynna confirmed, giggling. “Our little heir.”

I didn’t wait to hear more. I turned, walked down the hall with every ounce of dignity I had left, and stepped into the first cab I could find.

Tears blurred my vision, but I didn’t let them fall. Not yet.

I reached into my bag, pulled out my phone, and dialed a number I’d been avoiding for weeks.

“This is Chloe Rose Moore,” I said when the line picked up.

“Yes, ma’am?”

“I want to file for divorce,” I said. “Immediately.”

Chapter 2

“I want to file for divorce,” I said firmly, clutching my phone like a lifeline. “Immediately.”

A pause on the other end. “Mrs. Moore… under your marital contract, both parties—especially the families—must be involved. Your in-laws must approve.”

“I don’t care.” My voice didn’t waver. “Just draft the papers and send them to me. Whether they sign or not, I’ll find a way.”

And with that, I hung up.

The silence in the hallway felt heavier after that. I hadn’t even made it to the gates of our home before I already felt like a stranger in it.

The moment I stepped inside, I sensed something had changed. No one greeted me. No one asked how I was. The air was colder, stiffer. My room, the one that had always felt like mine even when nothing else did, had been emptied. The curtains were different. The bedcovers were replaced. My dresser was filled with someone else’s things.

Alynna’s. Panic rising in my chest, I opened the cabinet only to find my belongings boxed up and shoved into a corner. Dusty, neglected. As if I had already been erased.

I hurried outside, searching for someone—anything familiar—and stopped short when I saw the maid near the garden, standing beside a small flame. A pile of items fed the fire: old jewelry boxes, yellowed letters, delicate fabrics. Things that looked painfully familiar.

I ran to her. “What is this? What are you burning?”

She turned with a hesitant look. “Miss Alynna said to dispose of the old things from storage… These were marked as ‘unnecessary.’”

My stomach turned. “These belonged to my mother!”

Just then, Alynna appeared behind me, holding another box in her hands. “Oh good, you’re here. I was just about to tell them to burn this one too. Dad said we’re clearing out old junk for the renovations. Sentimental clutter just slows things down.”

I stepped forward, my hands trembling. “That’s not clutter. Those are my mother’s memories. You don’t get to decide what stays.”

Alynna gave me a flat smile. “She’s dead, Chloe. She’s not coming back. And let’s be honest—you were the reason she died, weren’t you?”

The sting of her words landed harder than the slap I gave her.

She burst out theatrically. “Oh God—did you just hit me?”

Clinton appeared then, footsteps sharp, face unreadable. “What’s going on?”

“She slapped me,” Alynna sniffled. “I was just trying to help. Chloe got upset about some old things. I didn’t mean to upset her…”

Clinton turned to me. “What’s your problem? She’s trying to help and you lash out like this?”

“They were my mother’s,” I said, barely able to raise my voice. “And she’s throwing them away like they mean nothing.”

“So what?” he snapped. “She’s gone. We’re moving forward.”

And there it was. The truth, out loud. He had already left me in his heart. Maybe he never truly stayed.

I couldn’t even argue. I was too tired to. Too empty.

But then the memories came rushing in—how it all started. Six years ago. Back when Alynna had left the country for school and left Clinton devastated. I had been there, a silent shadow, a friend, someone who offered him comfort when he was drinking and miserable. And in a single, foolish night… everything changed.

He proposed months later, saying he wanted something real. I believed him.

And then Alynna came back. And suddenly I wasn’t enough anymore.

Their affair started slowly—subtle glances, inside jokes. And then it wasn’t hidden at all. She told me herself, over wine one afternoon: “He was mine first. He’ll always be mine. You were just a substitute until I came back.”

I should’ve left then. But I stayed. For the baby. For a love that clearly didn’t exist.

“You’ve caused enough trouble,” my father’s voice boomed from the patio. “After everything, now you’re fighting with Alynna too? Haven’t you done enough?”

His words hit me like another slap. “You’re grounded. Go to your room and stay there. Don’t come out until you’ve learned your place.”

And so I was locked inside.

The hours passed slowly, the silence louder than ever. Laughter echoed from downstairs—the three of them living, celebrating, pretending I never existed.

I cried myself to sleep that night.

A day later, the door creaked open. Alynna stepped in, holding a tray of food. Her smile was cold and victorious.

“Eat up, sister. You must be starving. It’s been a day. You know your place now, right?”

I glared at her. “I don’t want anything from you.”

She tilted her head. “Suit yourself. But Clinton did say you looked pale. Wouldn’t want to worry anyone.”

I hesitated, my stomach churning. But hunger won over suspicion.

Minutes after I took a bite, I started to sweat. My throat closed. My skin began to itch. Then I knew.

Seafood. I was allergic.

I stumbled to the bathroom, clutching the wall, calling for help. No one answered.

I faintly heard Clinton’s voice from the hall. “What’s going on?”

“She didn’t like the food,” Alynna replied calmly. “She was screaming for no reason.”

“What? An ungrateful woman! You already cook for her and she’d say that? Let’s just leave her and have fun outside.”

The last thing I heard was their voices laughing before everything went black.

Chapter 3

I woke up to the sterile white of the hospital ceiling again. The smell of antiseptic was too familiar by now, as if even my lungs had learned to live with it.

A nurse leaned over, gently checking my vitals. “You’re awake,” she said softly, then sighed. “Chloe… this is the third time this month. I really think you should call someone. A family member. A friend? Or should we report this to the police?”

I gave her a faint smile, though it didn’t reach my eyes. “There’s no one left to call. And I’m okay, I’ll handle this myself.”

She hesitated, clearly unsure of how to respond. Then she nodded and quietly excused herself.

As soon as the door clicked shut, I turned to my phone resting on the side table. Notifications flashed across the screen. One, in particular, made my breath catch.

It was a message from Alynna.

There was a photo. A fresh one—Alynna curled up in Clinton’s arms, the two of them smiling like the world hadn’t just shattered around me. Like I hadn't just buried our baby. Like I didn't exist.

A second later, a video followed. I hesitated—my finger hovering—then tapped play.

It was them. In our room. My room.

Alynna giggling as Clinton pulled her close. His hands around her body. Her lips pressing to his as he lifted her onto the bed. And then—her calling his name like I never existed.

My throat tightened. My chest felt hollow.

Another message lit up my screen.

“Oops, I don’t think you were supposed to see that. But since you did—sorry. Clinton can’t come today. He’s… busy. With me. Don’t worry. You won’t die from a little food mishap, right?”

I stared at it for a long time. But I didn’t cry.

Not anymore.

Instead, I deleted the message and placed my phone face down. My heart felt strangely light—like it had been emptied out long ago, and now there was nothing left to break.

Moments later, the phone buzzed again. This time, it was from Nathan.

“Everything’s ready. Just give me the signal and I’ll pick you up. No more delays, Chloe.”

A lump formed in my throat.

“I’ll be there,” I typed back.

“You better be,” he replied. “I’m not going to let you waste your life with that man anymore.”

Nathan. The one I once rejected because I thought loyalty to Clinton mattered more than love. The one who waited anyway. The one who offered me an out.

It was time to take it.

Later that day, I was discharged. No one came to pick me up—not that I expected anyone to.

When I returned home, I headed straight to my room, only to find more of Alynna’s things in place of mine. Makeup scattered on my vanity. Her heels in my closet. Like I was already erased from the life I supposedly owned.

But I wasn’t staying long. I just had one final thing to do.

The divorce papers were inside my bag, freshly printed and ready. The only missing part was Clinton’s signature.

And as if the universe heard me, there he was at the dining table, buried under a stack of documents. He didn’t even look up.

“Bring me some coffee,” he muttered. “And sort through these. Just flip them when I’m done.”

I approached slowly, heart pounding, and slipped the divorce papers into the stack. When he reached for the pen, I flipped the page without blinking.

He signed. Just like that.

“Anything else?” he asked flatly.

“No,” I said quietly. “I’m not feeling well. I’ll rest after I cook.”

“Good,” he grunted. “Alynna’s craving something spicy. Don’t mess it up.”

I nodded and walked to the kitchen.

No more arguments. No more shouting. Just this one last performance before the curtain dropped on this life.

I chopped the vegetables in silence. The knife hitting the board was the only rhythm left in my heart.

Alynna walked in moments later. She leaned against the counter like she owned the entire house. “You’re still here?” she said, her voice sharp and smug.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t need to.

“I mean, why?” she pressed on. “Shouldn’t you be gone by now? Honestly, I thought I got rid of you already. You’re like gum on a shoe.”

I kept chopping, refusing to give her the satisfaction of a response.

Then she leaned closer and whispered, “Why are you still alive?”

That made me stop.

“I will be gone soon,” I said evenly. “You don’t have to worry about me anymore.”

A slow, wicked smile spread across her face. “Good. Be gone before I give him his heir. I don’t want you clinging to our lives like a ghost.”

She turned and walked out, heels clicking against the tile.

But what she didn’t know—what none of them knew—was that I was already gone.

All that remained now was my shadow.

Chapter 4

I was folding the last of my clothes into the suitcase when the door slammed open.

“What do you think you’re doing?” my father barked from the doorway.

I looked up slowly, calmly. “I’m going on a short trip. Just a few days by myself.”

His eyes narrowed, like he was waiting for me to flinch. “Did I say you could go anywhere? Have you forgotten you’re supposed to prepare for my birthday tomorrow?”

“I already did,” I said, quietly. “The venue is booked. The catering confirmed. I made sure everything was taken care of.”

“Oh, really?” he sneered. “Then why did the venue call just now threatening to cancel because someone failed to confirm the guest list?”

My lips parted, confused. I was certain everything was handled. But before I could speak, he cut me off.

“Useless,” he muttered. “Just like always.”

I stiffened.

Behind him, Alynna appeared with that sweet, soft voice of hers.

“Dad, please don’t get mad at her. She probably just forgot. It happens.” She turned to me with a smile. “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. You’ve done enough already.”

I looked at her. And in that moment, I knew.

She had sabotaged it. Again.

It had always been like this.

I remembered being ten when Alynna shattered one of our mother’s favorite porcelain vases. She looked me dead in the eyes, lip trembling, and cried, “Chloe pushed me!” Even as I stood there, frozen, hands tucked behind my back, our father stormed in and didn’t even ask. He grabbed me by the arm, yelling about how I was reckless, ungrateful—that I didn’t deserve anything in the house I broke.

A few years later, it was the entrance exam forms. I’d spent the night carefully filling them out for both of us. The next morning, hers were torn, mine untouched. She cried again—“Chloe must’ve switched them! She probably wanted to be the only one to pass!”

And again, he believed her.

He always did. Every broken thing. Every mistake. Every missed appointment or misunderstood chore—it was Chloe’s fault. Alynna was the golden one, even when she was cruel. She had the smiles, the charm, the lies dressed in silk. I was the stain on the family name.

And every time I tried to speak? I was silenced. Dismissed. So I stopped speaking. What was the point?

They left me in my room, like they always did, with nothing but my thoughts and my bag.

Just one more day, I reminded myself. Just tomorrow… and I’ll be gone.

The next morning was filled with noise. Decorations. Staff. Laughter.

Of course, Alynna was the star of the show. Everyone praised her for “fixing” the problem with the venue. No one even looked my way. My father, dressed in his finest, gave me a glance of disdain.

“For your punishment,” he said loudly, “you’ll be serving drinks tonight. Stay away from our table. I don’t want you embarrassing me.”

Then Clinton chimed in, already buttoning his cufflinks. “And give your necklace to Alynna. It matches her dress better.”

My fingers instinctively clutched the pendant at my throat—delicate, gold-plated, and worn from years of holding it close. My mother’s. The last thing she ever gave me before she died. My breath caught.

“No,” I said quietly, then louder, firmer. “No. This necklace is mine. It was my mother’s. It’s the only thing I have left of her.”

Alynna stepped forward, already in full performance mode. “It’s okay, Chloe,” she said in that sweet voice that always made people fall for her lies. “I didn’t know it was that important to you. I just thought… maybe I could wear it just for tonight. It would mean a lot—”

“It means everything to me,” I cut in. “You already took everything else.”

Clinton’s jaw tightened. “Don’t be dramatic.”

“I’m not being dramatic, I’m asking you to respect this. Just this one thing.”

Clinton strode over to me in two quick steps. “Fine. If you won’t hand it over…” He reached out, his hand curling around the chain. “Then I’ll take it.”

“Clinton, don’t—!”

He yanked.

The clasp snapped against the back of my neck, a sharp sting biting into my skin. I flinched, but I didn’t cry out. Not this time.

He tossed it to Alynna like it meant nothing.

“It looks better on her anyway,” he said flatly.

They all walked out without me. I was truly done.

Later that evening, when the last car rolled down the driveway and the estate went quiet, I stood up from the bench outside the gate and walked to the back garage. My suitcase was already packed. The limousine I’d arranged with Nathan was waiting.

I handed my old house key to the mailman at the gate, along with a sealed envelope.

Inside it: the divorce papers, the wedding ring, and a thick folder of evidence—proof of every lie Alynna had told, every mistake she blamed on me, and every time I took the fall.

As I slid into the back seat of the limousine, my phone buzzed.

It was Clinton.

“Where the heck are you? The party started. My grandfather’s asking where you are. Don’t you dare ruin this for me. Get here now and be a good wife.”

I stared at the screen for a second. Then, with a steady hand, I typed:

“I’m no longer your wife. So enjoy the party. I already sent you my goodbye gift, my dear ex-husband.”

I hit send. Turned my phone off. And watched as the gates closed behind me.

It definitely came through with full on grape. It could probably use a little more rest time, or my temp was too high, but there was a little something in the way of the overall sweetness. The flavor is for sure there though. Someone else mentioned Boone's Farm and I know exactly what they mean. The cup had that grape flavor which I'm sure we all find so familiar from other things. I'll let it rest a bit more and see where it goes. I love unashamedly fruity coffees, this one was fun and I enjoyed it.

I watched as the house across the street had been sold. I sure hope it does not have a bunch of teenage girls. I don't need that kind of shit, and neither do my members. I watched as a woman and for boys all well over 6 feet, 4 inches or more tall got out of the cars. Then I noticed the Indian motorcycle pulled up and parked behind a truck.

My VP and I watched as a small boy got off. Then our mouths dropped open. It was a girl whos hair flew down her back, past her hips as she took off her helmet. We heard one of the boys yell something and she ran over and jumped into his arms. She is short, very, short. But I am looking at the older woman. She has dark red hair that flows down her back to her hips. She is about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with long legs.

As we watched them walk around the property we heard the boys talking about how much land came with it. And there were two three car garages. And a huge metal building in the back. We sat watching to see what happened next. Sure enough the for sale sign was removed.

We watched as the older woman and one of the older boys got into the truck and headed to town. Just then the bigger boys grabbed the girl and started tossing her back and forth. We heard them yelling she had to agree to something. I heard her yell ""fuck you guys."" They stood her on her feet and crossed their arms. Looking down at her.

The started yelling at her and I laughed as she just stood there and glared at them. She showed no fear of them. ""Dam that little girl is a spitfire"" I said looking at my VP. My VP is a 24 year old man that loves pussy. My VP's name is Ripper. He looked at me laughing. ""She is a handful isn't she?"" The we really laughed as she walked away giving them the finger.

I was so pissed at my brothers. I just turned 18 and will graduate from high school this year. My brothers rang from 25,24,23,22, and 20. Ace is 25, Turk, is 24, Panther is 23, Racer is 22, and Fist is 20. Mom stopped having kids after I came along. My dad died in a bar fight trying to protect my mother.

My dad's brother is the president of the Wild Eagle MC. of Lima, Ohio. His name is Hunter. He told mom about this house. Mom sold our house and decided to move from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Celina, Ohio. I sit down on the porch and lit a joint.

I looked up and saw the moving truck pull into the driveway. I walked into the house and looked at all the bedrooms. I turned left at the top of the stairs. I walked down the hallway and opened the door. This is my room, it has its own bathroom.

""I opened the window and yelled down that they better pick their bedrooms because this one is mine.""

They can't argue with that because this one is purple. A girls room. I heard them running toward the room I was in. My brothers were yelling they want this one until they walked in and saw the walls are purple.

""Fuck that"" they said. They all turned and started looking around until they all had picked the rooms they wanted. My bed was up and the boxes stacked against the wall. I made my bed, then started hanging my clothes in the closet. Then I put them in the dresser.

My desk was against the wall next to the door. I had everything unpacked and turned my radio on. Then I climbed out my window and sat on he roof.

I looked up and saw her sitting on the roof. She couldn't be more than 18. I heard one of her brothers yelling at her to get off the roof. I caught my breath as she walked to the edge and looked down at him.

Granted it could not be more than 5 or 10 feet off the ground. But she could fall and hurt herself. Knight Rider MC

""Do you really want me off the roof Ace."" She asked.

""Get off before you fall.""

I watched as she sat on the edge of the roof. Then she jumped off.

""Fuck,"" I said standing up. Then I saw him catch her.

""Will you stop doing that Star.""

""One of these days you are gong to get hurt.""

I heard her laugh and my breath caught in my throat. It was beautiful. I saw another brother walk out on the porch and he said, ""Mom just called."" She is on her way home with groceries. She will need help unloading them.

She also said she had some news for us. We turned as mom pulled into the driveway and parked. We all started carrying groceries into the house. We started putting them away.

Turk asked. ""What is your news mom?""

""I got a job at the nursing home down the road.""

""I will be the nurse in charge and work the morning shift.""

""There is a nursing assistant position open on the second shift.""

""I brought you an application home, Star.""

""You can work after school. Here is the application."" I start in two days. I can take your application in when I go to work. I took it to my room, filled it out then gave it back to my mom.

""I am going to park my bike in the big shed out back. I said walking out the door. I walked over sat on my bike and started it. Then I started it and rode around the cars and trucks to the back yard.

I drove it into the building parked it, shut it off and got off walking out of the building. I walked over to my mustang and parked it in the garage. I then walked back into the house.

Chapter 2: Brandy

I am the mother of four boys and one daughter. I am a nurse and I just moved my family to Celina, Ohio. My husband was killed last year in a bar protecting me. I needed to move from Fort Wayne, Indiana. I moved to a nice town with a lake. It is not a big town but that is what I wanted for my kids. I moved across the street from the Knight Rider MC.

I heard a knock on the front door. I opened it large, tall man wearing a cut standing there. I opened the door and ""asked if I could help him.""

""I want to introduce myself. My name is Gunner and I am the president of the club across the street.""

""We are having a BBQ this weekend and would like to invite you and your family over. It starts at 7:00 pm.""

""My name is Brandy, Thank you, we will be there.""

I watched as he walked down the porch steps. That was nice of him. I told the boys were invited to the BBQ. Star is not home so I will tell her in the morning. I got home at 1:00 Am. Everyone was in bed. I walked into my room and put my money in a lock box. I made $25,000 tonight. I took a shower and went to bed. I have school in the morning.

I got up and dressed for school. I made me coffee and cereal. I put my bowl in the dishwasher before walking out and getting into my car. I drove to the high school and parked my car. I walked to the office and got my schedule. After school I walked to my car and drove home. Again no one was home when I walked in.

I made me a sandwich and coffee before I walked up stairs to my room where I changed into shorts and a tee-shirt. I ate my sandwich and drank my coffee before I completed my homework. We have been here almost a week now. Tomarrow is Saturday. I wonder what mom has planned.

It seems my brothers have all planned to stay at the club across the street. They are hardly at home anymore. I miss Panther. He moved to Florida a week ago. He is the president of his own MC now. I walked down stairs and saw my brothers in the living room.

""What are we all doing tomarrow?""

We don't know about you, but we have all been invited to a BBQ across the street.

""What do you mean, you don't know about me?""

""I wasn't invited?""

""Mom didn't mention you.""

""Oh, Ok,"" I said getting up and walking out the front door to sit on the porch. I felt a tear slide down my face. I was not invited to attend the BBQ. How could mom do that? It was not fair that I was not invited and they would go without me. I watched as mom and the boys started out the door.

I said. ""Mom how could you go over there when I was not invited.""

I than ran out the door got on my bike and drove out of the driveway and down the road.

""What did she mean by that Ace.""

""Well, you told us boys that you and we were invited.""

""You didn't mention Star, so we told her she was not invited.""

I drove to the restaurant in town and parked my bike. I saw a girl come out and get on her bike.

""Hey, didn't you move into the house across the street from our club?""

""Yes, why do you ask?""

""Aren't you coming to the BBQ?""

""I was not invited.""

""My brothers said that just them and my mom was.""

""That can't be right, my brother would not do that.""

""Well apparently he did."" I said turning and walking into the restaurant and ordered food. I looked out the window and saw it was getting dark so I got on my bike and rode home.

I saw them walk into the club but I did not see the girl. Where is she? Introductions were made and I asked.

""Where is your daughter?""

""She was not invited.""

""Wait, What?""

""Of course, she was.""

""Fuck."" I heard her brothers say.

""We didn't think she was because she is not 21.""

""Of course, she was invited. This is a family BBQ.""

""She left the house when we told hers she was not invited.""

I was pissed that Gunner did not include that girl in the invitation. I walked in the club slamming the door.

""How the fuck could you do that Gunner?""

""What?""

""Not invite that girl here.""

""And you,"" I said, looking at her mother and brothers.

""What the fuck is wrong with you?""

""As her mother you should not have come here without her.""

""Some fucking mother you are.""

""And you guys as her brothers should have stood up for your little sister.""

""She told me our club can go straight to hell.""

""And I just bet she will have somethings to say to all of you.""

I said. ""Gunner you should have mad it plain that girl was included in the invitation.""

""Where is she Grace?""

""In town at the restaurant.""

Then we heard the bike coming down the street. That might be her returning home."" Go get her Ripper.""

I saw her walk into the house as I walked across the street. I knocked on the door and waited for her to answer it. I opened the door and saw the VP standing there. I looked at him with cold eyes. I slammed the door shut and locked it.

What the hell just happened I asked myself. Her eyes were like ice. She took one look at me and slammed the door shut without saying one word. I knocked again but she didn't answer it. I walked back to the club.

""Where is she?"" Asked Gunner.

I told him what happened and her brothers gasped.

""Fuck mom, she is going to do it again.""

""She is going to shut down.""

Chapter 3: Five Months Later

I have not talked to my mom or my brothers. Mom is dating the president Gunner. I do not talk to any of the them. That is because they live in the clubhouse now. I never see any of them.

They don't answer my phone calls either. I feel as if they have forgotten about me. I graduated from high school three days ago. Not one of them remembered or were there at least for me.

I did know that some of the bikers were at the graduation. Because five of the members kids graduated with me. I saw my mother and brothers sitting with them. I did not hear my name called out and they did not meet me afterwards to take any pictures.

I watched as they posed with the club and their kids for pictures. I saw that same girl as I left the school alone. No pictures of me or my family to remember my graduation. It is as if they forgot that I even existed.

I saw that girl look from me to my family with sad eyes. I turned with tears in my eyes and walked over to my car and left. We were sitting in the club when Grace walked in and looked at us with the coldest eyes.

""What the hell is wrong with you Grace?""

""You did not yell out Stars name has she received her diploma.""

""You did not take pictures with Star after graduation.""

""I just bet she doesn't have a graduation party. No presents.""

""No wonder she hates us all.""

""You forgot you even had a sister.""

We looked at each other and felt like shit. No one yelled her name. We are terrible brothers. We walked over to the house but it was empty. Star is not here.

We tried calling her but it kept going to voice mail. Where could she be? I was home. I was in the back yard behind the big building. I was sitting near a small fire, drinking and smoking.

""Congratulations to me."" I said.""

I had drank about six beers. I looked up at the sky and noticed it was getting dark. I put the fire out, grabbed my beer and walked around the building. The house is dark so that meant everyone was across the street.

I grabbed my beer and walked toward the street from the back yard. I opened my car door and grabbed my Cigarrates. And the joint from the ash tray and lit it. I shut the door and turned around and bumped into someone.

I looked up and saw him, the VP. I went to step around him But he stopped me.

""Why don't you come over to the club and see your mom and brothers?""

""Why should I?""

""I have not been invited there before?""

""And where were they when I graduated?""

""Not with me, they were with your club members, yelling and clapping for their kids.""

""They took pictures with them.""

""I was left out on the side lines. Not one of my brothers or mother yelled or clapped for me.""

""Not one of them took a picture with me.""

""And not one of them gave me a graduation gift or party.""

""I don't owe them one fucking thing.""

""So go straight to hell.""

I gave him the finger and walked into the house. She is one angry person. I heard she graduated from high school and no one was there for her. She had no party, nothing. They forgot about her. It was starting to piss me off.

It was like they forgot they had a sister, and mother had a daughter. She was being left on her own. It all started because she was not at the BBQ.

I tried to talk to her but she wants nothing to do with me or the club. They never even tried to make it up to her. Not one of us even came over or tried to talk to her. We are partly to blame for her anger.

I want to get to know her but that is not going to happen. Her mom is marring Gunner tomarrow. I bet she will not attend. What is she going to do when he moves into the house?

Hell, I wonder if she even knows they are getting married? I walked over and looked at her.

""Are you coming to your mom's wedding tomarrow?""

I saw her turn her head and look at me. I could tell she was shocked.

""You didn't know did you?""

I just looked at him. My face going white. I stood up walked into the house shutting the door behind me. Fuck, she didn't know. I saw the light in her bedroom come on. I walked across the street in a very pissed off mood. Not one of them better say a word to me.

I walked to the spare bedroom where the boxes were kept. I started to carry them to my room where I started to pack the things in my room.

I finished packing my clothes, laptop, and other things. I then walked downstairs, grabbed the news paper and walked back to my room.

I started looking for apartments. I called three of them scheduling a time to see them in the morning. Then I shut my bedroom light off and looked across the street.

Why have they all forgotten about me? I don't get it. It is as if I don't matter to them anymore. I was off work today because it was supposed to be a day of celebration for me. It isn't, no one cared about me.

I heard the doorbell and walked down stairs. I saw it was Ace and Panthers girlfriends. ""We came to the party to celebrate your graduation.""

""Where is the party Star?""

""What Party?""

""What do you mean what party?""

""I don't have one. No one even came to see me graduate.""

""We were told to come for the graduation party.""

""You must mean for the club members kids that graduated.""

""There is none for me.""

""They are across the street.""

I saw the anger in their eyes.

""Right over there."" I said.

I closed the door, locked it and walked back upstairs. What the hell we said. How dare they do that to Star.

""I don't know about you Belle,""

"" but I will not date a man that does that to his sister.""

"" I am with you Iris said.""

We put the gifts on the porch. We stormed across the street. When we walked in we found Ace and Panther. We walked over and looked at them in anger.

""You made it to the graduation party""

It got really quiet. ""We went to the house where we thought was Star's graduation party.""

""But found there is no graduation party for Star.""

""So, how was her graduation party boys?""

We all looked at each other.

""We didn't go to her graduation.""

""No you didn't. Instead you went to this fucking clubs kids graduation instead of your own sisters.""

""You are having a graduation party for this clubs kids Instead of giving your baby sister a graduation party.""

""We cannot, and will not have boyfriends who treat their sister like that.""

""Find new girlfriends.""

""You do not mean that.""

""Oh but we do. Tell us this Ace, Panther. Have you guys paid any attention to your sister since you moved in here?""

""Has she been over here?""

""Did this club include her in the graduation?""

""No, so go to hell.""

""We are going to drag Star out of that house, get her drunk, get into fights, and give her a celebration she will never forget.""

""You two go fuck yourselves.""

We turned walked out of their clubhouse and slammed the door shut. We walked over to the house and pounded on it until Star opened it. We walked in and pulled her to her room.

We went threw her boxes until we found what we were looking for. ""Put these on and come back out here.""

""What are you doing?""

""We are going out to celebrate your graduation.""

""We are going to our club. Or your uncles club.""

While she was dressing we called her uncle Hunter and told him everything. He was pissed.

""Bring her here, we will get the cake and ice cream and gifts.""

# Chapter 1 (Liv) Same old same old

I stood in the schoolyard, waiting for Connor. At only eight, Chloe had a better sense of time and punctuality than her big brother did at twelve. Connor always seemed to get waylaid at the end of school, stopping to chat to friends, involving himself in some kind of impromptu ball game, or just generally dragging his feet.

""Where is he, mom? I don't want to be late for gymnastics,"" Chloe wined.

Thursdays were always a nightmare. I went straight from school pick-up to home, set up a quick snack, pushed the kids to change into their practice gear, and then engaged in a two-hour drop-off and pick-up loop.

I checked my phone. He had three minutes until he would make us truly late. Connor suddenly appeared, looking sweaty and red. Looks like it was a ball game that distracted him this time.

""I'm here, let's go,"" he said.

We began to walk to the car. ""Connor, you know how hard Thursdays are. You need to make a bigger effort,"" I scolded. I was exhausted. My blood test last week had shown that I was iron deficient, not enough for an infusion but I definitely had to take it easy and take supplements.

""Remember, I'm dropping you and Dad will bring you home. I'll be at gymnastics with Chloe"" I said.

""Yep, I remember. I can't believe he's my coach! It's gonna be a good season,"" Connor enthused.

My husband Brad had taken the position of basketball coach for the under 12s and Connor was thrilled. He made most basketball games, but hadn't taken on any official positions until now because he was worried that he wouldn't be able to commit given his working hours were sometimes varied. He was an engineer, but recently, he'd had a promotion and oddly enough, he had greater control of his office hours, preferring to work at home for a few hours on the weekend than spend extra time at work during the week.

After zipping home and getting through our pre-training routine, I was back on the road. Brad was waiting at the stadium doors, having come straight from work. He came over to my window.

""Told you I'd make it,"" he grinned.

""Good work, coach!"" I turned to Connor. ""Have fun and be respectful. Remember, your team doesn't need you fouling."" Connor was a good kid, but he sometimes got way too competitive. When Brad signed up as coach, he'd made it his goal to help Connor become a bit more level-headed. I waved to my boys and headed to the gymnastics studio. Chloe loved anything physical, and gymnastics was the perfect outlet for her athleticism and daredevil tendencies. She was particularly excited today because she'd made a new friend at school. She hadn't stopped talking about Jordan, who had just moved to the area a week ago.

I sat with my takeaway coffee, watching the girls tread nervously across the beam.

""Is that you, Liv?"" a deep voice asked.

I turned to see an older version of Joseph Carey, a guy I'd known in high school. We hadn't gone to the same school, and he was a few years older. He'd been at all the local parties, and we had always enjoyed snappy banter and light flirtation. We'd made out a few times at parties but had never had anything serious. I met Brad when I turned 18 and Joseph had left town to pursue new job opportunities. He was an architect, and his options had been limited in Samson.

""Oh my God, Joe!""

He sat on the bench next to me.

""It's been way too long! What, at least 20 years?""

I laughed. ""A bit less than 20 years, I think, but up there somewhere. How have you been? What are you doing back in Samson?""

""I moved back a week ago. My ex-wife moved here to be with her new partner, and I was feeling nostalgic. Plus, my daughter Jordan now lives here. We share custody, so I thought it was time to return home. I'm designing homes in Holstead.""

""Wow, Holstead. La di da! Rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous, huh? You're Jordan's dad? Chloe hasn't stopped talking about Jordan! I'm so pleased they're friends. Any other kids?"" I asked.

""Yeah, we have Jeremy, who's 10. He's with Gabbie at the moment.""

Gabbie was the ex-wife. I will admit to a little Facebook stalking here and there. I'd definitely had a thing for Joseph back in the day, so after a few drinks with my friend Lisa, we'd stalked our old crushes. I knew he was married but didn't know they'd split up.

""Well, it's great to have you back home. Chloe loves gymnastics and she'll love it even more now that Jordan has joined. How's the family?""

""Dad had some stents put in a few years back but is doing well. Mom is her usual self, filling her schedule with all kinds of stuff. Rob is still 'finding himself.' He's in the US right now, but last year it was France. He's met someone now though, so maybe this one sticks.""

Rob was his younger brother. He was a great guy but always looking for the next adventure. Rob and I were the same age, but I'd never really had much to do with him beyond chatting at parties.

We spent the rest of the gymnastics session catching up. I loved chatting about old times. Friends like Lisa were awesome. Nothing like 'mom friends' who understood your life, but it was so fun to reminisce with someone who shared your past.

Chloe appeared beside me with a small blonde girl. ""Mom, did you see my beam walk?""

""I sure did. You'll be walking backwards on it in no time!"" I encouraged.

""This is Jordan,"" she said, motioning to the girl beside her.

""Hi Jordan. My name is Liv. It's so good to meet you.""

""Hello,"" the little girl said awkwardly, shifting her eyes to her dad and grabbing his hand. She was shy, little cutie.

""Well, we better get home. Dinner won't cook itself. I tried once and it didn't work,"" I said to Jordan and Joseph.

""So good to see you! I do most of the gymnastics drops so Gabs can spend time with Jeremy, so I'm sure I'll run into you soon,"" Joseph offered, before walking out toward the car park.

Chloe took my hand, which was unusual. She was following Jordan's lead. We spent the ride home chatting about her upcoming Level 1 badge and how she wished the teacher had let her in the foam pit today. When we pulled up, I felt instantly exhausted. Night routines were a killer lately with my tiredness, and Brad was very little help. He'd stir the sauce or pull out some plates, then go sit on the sofa, thinking that was enough. I worked part time, and he worked full time, but I still think I did more in one day than he did. It wouldn't kill him to help with dinner and clean up, or pretty much any damn thing around the house. He'd grown up with a stay-at-home mom who did everything for him and seemed to think that was just how things were done. I sighed, preparing myself for a busy few hours before I could collapse into my bed with my iPad to binge on my latest Netflix obsession.

# Chapter 2 (Liv) Stale nights

By Wednesday, I was feeling a little better. The supplements were helping, and I'd forced myself to reduce my ""me"" time (aka Netflix in bed) so that I could get more sleep. The kids were in bed, so I made a cup of tea and sat on the sofa, flicking through my phone.

Brad was doing the same, reading through tips for basketball coaches.

""The team is really good. I think we have a shot this year,"" he stated, putting his feet on the coffee table.

""Awesome. It was hard to see them flogged every game last season,"" I said. ""I mean, it's only junior sport but losing every game is just so disheartening for them."" Connor was pretty okay with losing, but some of the boys took it very hard.

""Megan has stepped up as team manager, so I can focus more on strategy. I'm thinking they all need more fitness training. Some of them are slumped by half time.""

""Megan? Grady's mom?"" I asked.

""Yeah, Megan Weston. She's bloody organized, that woman. Saving me a heap of time on registrations,"" he mused. ""She also wants to push more social events to help the boys bond as a team.""

I hadn't really had much to do with Megan. Grady was in Connor's class, but the boys didn't really get along. They weren't enemies; they just didn't spend much time together, so I hadn't really spent much time with her.

""That's great. If every parent pitched in even just a little, it would share the burden. It's always the same families,"" I sighed. ""We're all busy people with busy lives. We all just need to do our bit. I'm happy to host a barbecue or something for the boys and their families.""

""Good idea! I'll chat to Megan about it and let you know. She's got some great ideas too. Oh, and did you get my suit from the dry cleaners? I need it on Friday. And can you book in the car for a service? My engine light went on today.""

""I'm pretty sure you can find the time to ring the mechanic,"" I snapped. I did everything in this house, mostly without complaint. Mostly. Surely he could do the ""man"" things. If he wanted to live in the 1950s like he was raised, he could do the outdoorsy and manly things. There was only so much of me to go around and sitting down for a coffee once in a while would be nice.

""Fine, I'll do it,"" he spat out. ""You work 24 hours a week. I thought you'd have time, that's all.""

""Yes, 24 hours a week, that's not including commute time. Then take out all the kids' drop-offs and pick-ups and running a house with four people in it. Then, add in my iron deficiency and me having to take your mom to the physio twice a week and I have very little time or energy left.""

Brad could be infuriating. He had always verged on lazy, but he'd been quite good when the kids were little. The older they got, he seemed to think no nappies and no bottles meant they were somehow self-sufficient. Newsflash, they weren't. They were needy in different ways. He never seemed to question why the fridge was always full, why meals were always made, why clothes were always washed and put away. He didn't seem to notice that the floors were clean, and the paths were swept. He never asked about school uniforms or how the kids always seemed to have season-appropriate clothing in their size. His only comment in relation to clothes and groceries was to question prices, and that really pissed me off. He'd stopped asking after the yoghurt incident. I'd bought organic yoghurt for Connor because it was the only brand he would eat. He didn't care that it was organic; he just seemed to really like the taste, so I continued to buy it.

Brad looked at the grocery receipt, which was odd in itself. He never bothered himself with household stuff. He choked on his coffee.

""$10 on fucking yoghurt?""

""It's a big tub,"" I answered, putting the cereal in the pantry.

""It'd wanna be a gallon of yoghurt for that price, Liv.""

""Connor likes it, it's healthy, so I buy it. And since when do you give a shit about groceries? You have your favorite brands. It fits in the budget, so why not?"" I snapped back.

He hadn't questioned grocery spending since that day. He once raised the issue of how much I spent on school shoes, and I shut that down by asking him to be in charge of it from now on if he was such an expert on children's podiatry.

""Yeah, I get it. You're busy, I'm busy. Sorry,"" he went back to his phone.

Ping. Text received. I looked at him in interest to see who it was from. It was 9:30 at night.

""Megan loves your idea. We'll sort it out at training."" He was happy with his new role as coach, and I was pleased for him and Connor. He could be a lazy dad, so it was nice to see him sharing an interest with his son. The downside was, he seemed to want a trophy for his efforts. Moms and dads stepped in every day. It's what we did as parents, what we should do as parents. Lincoln, the old coach, never expected a parade in his honor. We always thanked him, and he was given a gift at the end of the season in recognition of his efforts. That pleased Linc, and it was clear that gifts and praise were not his motivation. His son had moved into the higher age group this season, so sadly, we lost him as coach.

I picked up my mug and put it in the sink. Time for bed and maybe just 40 minutes of Netflix before I went to sleep.

""Goodnight,"" I called out to Brad.

""Night,"" he responded. Another night in the Stanton house.

# Chapter 3 (Liv) Ongoing snark

When I envisaged Brad taking on the position of volunteer coach of a children's team, I didn't envisage him taking it so seriously. He was always researching new plays and plotting positions. Even Connor was sick of him talking about new ideas at dinner. His phone chimed non-stop as he exchanged ideas with Megan, whom I was rapidly beginning to dislike. She was constantly in my face at school drop-off and pick-up, praising Brad's dedication and commitment. I internally snorted every time she told me what a good father he was. She certainly had low standards. I wasn't sure if Grady's dad was on the scene, but if Brad was her idea of a perfect father, I felt sorry for her. If coaching a kids' team makes up for being largely absent in our home, then yeah, give the man a prize.

As well as having her irritating face up in my grill in the schoolyard, she was constantly intruding in our home life. Phone calls, texts, and two unexpected visits. Brad seemed unconcerned. Of course he was; she fed into his ""big man"" ego. We'd had a huge fight last night about it, when she'd called during dinner.

""It's not the fucking NBA, Brad. We tell the kids no electronics at dinner, and you're here taking calls like you're the White House press secretary.""

""She works odd hours, and this is the only time we can talk until tomorrow,"" he retorted.

""So speak tomorrow! What about a 12-year-old boys basketball team is so damn urgent?""

""We're doing this for the kids, Liv. Bloody hell. You're the one who kept pushing me to get more involved."" His voice was frustrated, like he was talking to a child who didn't understand him. The fucking nerve.

""I think you just need your daily dose of flattery and hero worship from a clearly desperate woman. You must be having withdrawals of seeing her in her active wear,"" I threw at him. The woman always seemed to be in activewear. Every single time I saw her. The barbecue was on Friday night. I wondered if the activewear would be out in force.

""Whatever. I'll dial it back, but you're totally off base here. She's working hard for her kid, just like I am.""

That's where we left it. I wasn't naïve. Megan was a bit of a predator. I didn't know much about her when Brad stepped up as coach, but a few of the basketball moms had warned me that she'd flirted madly with the old coach Lincoln last season. Apparently Linc had been repulsed, and while he was polite, he had avoided her and her damn activewear at all costs.

Friday morning, I was madly cleaning and preparing for the barbecue. Brad had agreed to leave work to do some last-minute shopping to save me having to leave. I was running short on time and had stupidly forgotten drinks for the kids. We had a diabetic child in the team and I liked to have a good variety so he had a choice like the rest of the kids and didn't feel different.

Brad: Can you get drinks when you do school pick-up? Something's come up.

Me: At work? I'm running tight on time as it is Brad. We'll have a full house of people an hour and a bit after I get home.

Brad: Megan's car giving her trouble. She can't get home, so night will be ruined if I can't get her.

The night will be ruined? Why? She's not hosting. She's not bringing anything vital. Fuck this bitch. And what can Brad possibly do with her car? He wouldn't even know how to pop a bonnet.

Me: Not okay. She can leave her car there and get an Uber. You won't book in your own car service but will help Me-again with her car?

Things were getting nasty between us in relation to Megan. I'd told him that Linc was in her sights last year, and he'd dismissed me, saying he was a big boy and knew when a woman was hitting on him. He also said that Megan was lonely and didn't really mean to flirt. She just had loose boundaries because of her loneliness.

He didn't respond.

Me: Get the drinks. I literally don't have time.

Brad: Okay.

He was a fucking fool. He was making me feel like a jealous shrew, but the proof was right in his face that Megan was pulling strings. He wasn't a dumb man. Well, not academically. He seemed to have some emotional intelligence. He had strong friendships and built professional relationships easily. That only left the possibility that he was willfully being a dick. I had zero tolerance for this.

I had been catching up with Joseph at gymnastics and Brad had blown a gasket when I told him Joe was back in town.

""Ah, the one who got away,"" he sneered. ""Sit with someone else at gymnastics. It's not appropriate to be cozying up with him.""

""We don't cozy up. We're literally just talking. We communicate way less in frequency and intensity than you do with Me-again,"" I threw back at him.

No way would I stop talking to a friend because Brad had double standards. We argued a lot lately. It was exhausting. The more we argued about Megan and Joseph, the more we argued about everything. Minor arguments about household chores and family responsibilities turned epic, and we'd started arguing in the backyard or our bedroom to avoid upsetting the kids. I was nearly at the end of my tether and had been chatting with Lisa about potentially getting counseling or pushing for a trial separation. I couldn't live like this.

# Chapter 4 (Brad) Tired lives

I was so exhausted, and Liv had added yet another item to my to-do list for tonight. She'd already made me clean the barbecue yesterday in preparation for the event and now I had to buy drinks. Liv worked school hours four days a week. I don't think it was unreasonable to expect her to have organized this by herself. I could have fit in the shopping with hassle, but I'd promised Megan that I'd help her with her car, and I'm a man of my word, so now I had to find time to fit both things in. I couldn't turn around and tell her I couldn't help her because my wife said no.

When I'd arrived at her car, it was working again. Probably just overheated or something. She thanked me when I hit the 'start engine' button and it revved obediently. I was relieved because I really didn't know anything about cars, but I know her ex was a piece of shit, and she had no male relatives, so I didn't want to leave her abandoned by the side of the road.

I bustled through the grocery store and grabbed a random assortment of juice boxes, water, and bottled sugar-free drinks. Hopefully this was enough ""variety."" Liv had given me little direction on what to buy, just that I should get some sugar-free drinks.

I loved being Connor's coach, but it was way more involved than I had anticipated. Linc seemed to have done it easily and related to the kids so well. Megan was great with the kids, so I often left it to her to rally them when we had to get them assembled in a huddle. She had a way of telling the kids what to do without yelling at them or seeming angry.

I often wondered if this whole coaching gig was worth the trouble it had unleashed at home. Liv was constantly banging on about Megan, and I did understand. Megan was an attractive, single woman and I was spending a lot of time with her. I'd never stepped over the line though, and it was infuriating that Liv was giving me such hell when she was off snuggling with Joseph fucking Carey once a week. And who knew if it was only once a week? His kids went to the same school as ours, so they probably saw each other there too.

Liv's double standards were like a red rag to a bull for me. I had zero history with Megan. Hell, I didn't even have a present with Megan. But Joseph was always going to be her first love. She'd told me once that he'd left town just before we met, and that there had been ""something"" there. It was in a conversation about past love, and she'd mentioned a few teen crushes, and I'd mentioned the same, but the way she spoke about him was different. I wanted to meet this fucker. At least her ""threat,"" Megan, was in her face. Joseph was like this shadow man that I always seemed to miss. I knew the fucker was single too, and I wasn't impressed. Even if Liv had no feelings, he probably did. Liv was a beautiful woman and a real catch. She was loving and caring, and always put her family first. I had no doubt she'd be very attractive to a single man.

""I'm home,"" I called out, struggling to the kitchen with drinks piled up in my arms. ""Great, thanks. I've put a tub outside full of ice. Can you please put some drinks in it?"" Liv asked.

I wandered out to do as instructed. The kids were dancing about in the outdoor entertaining area, full of energy and excitement that there would be a house full of visitors soon.

""You excited guys?"" I asked.

Chloe squealed and nodded, while Connor did a fist pump.

""Yeah, we've been talking all week about this. We're gonna do other stuff too, but we want to play a game in the driveway when everyone gets here.""

Connor was an enthusiastic basketball player. We had a hoop over the garage, but we never seemed to be able to get out there. By the time I got home from work I was exhausted, and Liv insisted on a steady bedtime routine, so we didn't come out at night, even though we had outside lights.

Liv wandered out.

""Connor, put the Xbox away. I told you to do that earlier. Chloe, please get out of that dress. It's got a huge stain on it. Just put on something else.""

I looked at the kids and shrugged. Liv was amazing but she could also kill a mood faster than anyone I knew. We were always doing something wrong. Messing something up, dirtying something, or stuffing up her precise timelines. Before we had kids, we always said we wanted to be the ""fun parents."" I tried to stick to that, but she seemed to permanently be in a bad mood. Our arguing lately was epic, and I was beginning to worry about our marriage. She could be so unreasonable, and lately, she was being so jealous. I'd never cheated on Liv and didn't intend to start now.

I stacked the drinks and thought about how tonight might go. I knew a few of the dads from back in the day at high school. We'd been on the football team together, so there would be no shortage of conversation with them. I didn't know every parent well. I'd met them all, but most of us were really in that ""small talk"" phase. Megan looked after most of the parent communication, which was a relief. I wasn't on social media, and she had several team chats going.

All done! I headed inside for a quick shower. Time to get this show on the road!

# Chapter 5 (Liv) Side boob

The night was going well. The kids had broken up into a few groups, with the older ones having fun playing basketball on the drive. Everyone had arrived within about 10 minutes of each other, so I was still making my way around to greet them all. Phil and Ally were helpful as always. Ally offered around trays of nibblies while Phil poured everyone drinks. I shot a glare at Brad, who was in a deep conversation with Travis, no doubt about his high school football career judging by the way he was putting his arms in the air like he was marking a ball. Not the time for reliving your glory days, I thought angrily as I watched another man play host in his home.

""Brad,"" I called out. ""Can you please—""

""Liv, I love your home,"" Megan interrupted, coming up behind me. ""Thanks. I'm pleased you and Grady could make it,"" I answered. ""We have drinks in the tubs, wine in the fridge, and beer in the back fridge,"" I motioned her to the kitchen but she remained there. She was wearing a sundress that wasn't appropriate for the weather. Most of us were in jeans and sweaters. She had a casual knit jacket on and white street shoes. She looked nice, but out of place. Her black eyeliner was thick and she had her loose hair curled. No lipstick, but some kind of very shiny gloss. She was an attractive woman. That revelation didn't make me feel good. My hair was in a ponytail, and I had nothing on my face but a bit of anti-shine powder and lip balm. I just didn't have time after getting everything set up. Her perfume was so strong I could identify it. Gucci Guilty. It's a heavy scent, but I always liked it and had had a couple of bottles in my lifetime. I suddenly didn't like the perfume anymore.

""Grady, go out and play,"" she ordered him. He slumped his shoulders and headed out to the drive. He looked sad for some reason, so I was hoping the boys could liven him up a bit. ""Twelve-year-old boys, right?"" she said, rolling her eyes. ""Such an attitude.""

""Hopefully he has a good—""

""Team manager of the year! Good to see you,"" Brad enthused, clapping an arm around her shoulder.

""Coach of the century!"" she returned, smiling so wide I could see the sides of her molars. Ally was watching from across the counter. I saw her narrow her eyes and purse her lips. I looked at her, and she abruptly looked away. It seemed an appropriate exchange on the surface. I'd given most of the dads a touch on the back when they arrived, and one a kiss on the cheek because we were quite close with that particular couple. Brad did not kiss Megan, nor did she initiate such a greeting, but the whole thing made me uncomfortable.

""Did your husband tell you what a hero he is?"" She gushed. ""I was positively stranded today and he came on his white horse and got the car going."" Brad looked down at his beer.

""Wasn't anything much. It just started by itself,"" he said quietly.

So, he did help her after all. After I'd said he didn't have time. Look who suddenly had time management skills that were developed enough to allow him to do things for his wife and his crush? I pushed the nasty thought away.

After a while, all the kids streamed in, eager to devour the burgers. The adults tucked into steak or burgers, whatever they preferred. I was so pleased with how the night was going. It had been a huge effort to put together, and the preparation clean had been exhausting. I'd done it all last night to free up my day for setting up and doing last-minute things. I looked around at the mess, thinking that my day tomorrow would be spent on clean up. It was worth it though. The kids were all having fun and the adults were getting to know each other better.

Hours later, most of the parents had gone home. Some had young preschoolers, so hadn't made it a late night. It wasn't supposed to be a rager, just a simple, family-friendly get-together. Megan, Ally, and Phil remained. Megan was completely drunk, having downed nearly two bottles of wine herself. She jacked up our stereo and declared it was time for a 90s dance party. I turned the stereo down. We had elderly neighbors and I didn't want to rev the kids up.

""I think it's time we all left,"" Ally announced, calling out to Phil to grab their three kids. She looked at Megan. ""I think it's time you left too, but not in your car. Want me to call you an Uber?"" Poor Grady was sitting on the sofa with his arms crossed, embarrassed by his mother's behavior. Megan reached her hands up and began swaying quickly to the beat. She'd abandoned her jacket, and a hefty dose of side boob made its appearance under the gaping arms of her sundress.

""For God's sake,"" Ally hissed, throwing Megan's jacket around her shoulders. ""Time to go, Megan."" Ally glanced at me and said under her breath, ""We'd take her, but the car won't fit her and Grady. Just call the slob an Uber.""

Megan swayed a little too much and ended up toppling toward the dresser. Brad reached out and caught her, steadying her slight frame.

""Oops! My bad, big guy,"" she giggled, grabbing on to each of his biceps with her hands. Right, time for her to go.

""I'll order you an Uber, Megan. Grady are you ready to go?"" I asked. He nodded, keeping his eyes down.

""No Uber! I have a bad rating. I was accidentally sick with wine flu,"" she laughed, winking up at Brad drunkenly.

""Well, I'll use my account."" I said sharply. She was embarrassing herself and her child. I was half-tempted to offer to keep Grady here for the night and send her home on her own. Could she care for her child in this state in an Uber with a stranger driving? It didn't seem safe.

""I'll take her,"" Brad offered, grabbing his keys in one hand while he balanced Megan against his side with the other.

""Fine, I guess I'll clean up."" I fumed. Brad left, with Megan promising to deliver a word-perfect version of Ice Ice Baby to him in the car. Grady followed with his head down.

""She is so sloppy,"" Ally said in disgust. ""She does this all the time, though the side boob is a new addition to her repertoire.""

""I just feel for poor Grady. She embarrassed him so much in front of the other kids. And he's already a shy kid."" Grady was shy and his drunken mother's partying antics weren't helping him. I went to see Ally out, but she insisted on staying to help clean up, while Phil collected empty bottles. Bless them both.",1,1752039307.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1lvautc,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1lvautc/help_an_18_yo_choose_between_money_and_fulfillment/,Help an 18 y/o Choose Between Money and Fulfillment,"Hello everyone! I have just finished my first year of university at a top school, and, with that, I have a cornucopia of thoughts regarding my future career. The crux of my dilemma comes down to the weighing of money and fulfillment.

I have spent the entirety of my academic career, quite literally since elementary school, centered around STEM. Not because I have a passion for the area, but because I knew it led to the highest median salary. Likewise, I even picked my college major of computer science solely for its monetary prospects. Thankfully, my plan is working out so far. With a lot of hard work and luck, I secured a summer internship as a software engineer that I am currently working in. Its hourly rate is higher than both of my parents'. I leave this detail here, not to boast, but to emphasize the significance of this money to me and my family.

However, my real passion is in social work. I've been heavily involved in volunteering and humanitarian causes for the past several years, and it is these interactions and causes that bring me fulfillment. Interning full-time and being a full-time college student have taken my time away from these activities. This summer, I have been unable to commit time to the shelter I intended to volunteer at. Instead, I have spent time doing the things that all my university peers have been doing: networking, coffee chats, preparing for next summer's recruiting season (which is starting soon), etc. I do not enjoy computer science in the slightest. Despite having the privilege of a good working environment, I dread going to work and cannot imagine working in this field for 40 hours a week for the next 40 years. But I do enjoy the ability to take my parents out to nice restaurants, to buy things for my siblings, and all the privileges that come with holding money.

I care deeply about the humanities, but since I have neglected that aspect of myself for so long, my skills that are relevant to those fields of study (writing, critical thinking, political/cultural/social awareness) have deteriorated and are lacking far behind those of my peers who are studying those fields. This is another reason why I am scared to make a career pivot. I know that I am young, but I would still feel incredibly behind.

I have considering trying to pursue both computer science and social work at the same time. But I am a very one-track minded person. It is in my nature to pick one thing and do everything I can to excel in it (may be, in part, due to my diagnosed OCD). If I were able to continue volunteering while working in tech, I would. However, I would feel immense stress doing so because I know what I should be doing with my time to bolster my career in tech.

My thoughts are fresh and not yet well-formed. I recognize that I am in a very privileged spot to be asking this question. To have the ability and mobility to chase fulfillment at such a young age. But thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read to this point, as well as to anyone who has advice to give.",3,1752039302.0,findapath,2,1.0,False

I made it happen Novel_ Three months after my husband went missing in a skiing accident, I saw him at a bar.","**Husband loves to play dead? I made it happen**

Three months after my husband went missing in a skiing accident, I saw him at a bar.He had his arm slung around ""sis-bro"" Jamie's shoulder, laughing like he was free from a life sentence. “Thanks to you, dude,” he was saying, ""I was starting to forget what real freedom felt like.""His bros were buying him shots, one after another, asking when he was going to surface.He thought for a second, ""I'll give it another week, maybe. Let her sweat it out a bit, you know, drive her crazy before I show my face again.""I was standing in the shadows, watching him bask in his 'freedom', and dialed my friend at the county records office.1.“I’m going to have Mark Harrison declared legally deceased,” I said, my voice tight.“You're not going to keep looking?” my friend asked, hesitating.I looked up at Mark, who was now whispering something to Jamie, and my eyes stung. “There’s no point.”You can’t find someone who doesn’t want to be found.I hung up and went back to my booth.My bestie, Sarah, saw my face and shoved a drink into my hand. “Look, honey, Mark’s been gone for three months. The odds of him being alive are basically zero. You need to let go, move on.”I stared at the colorful drink in my glass and downed it in one go.The burn of the liquor made my eyes water, and I blinked back the tears, asking, “Do you think anyone would fake their own death to get away from their wife?”She looked at me like I’d sprouted a second head. ""What kind of crazy talk is that? Only a real dirtbag would pull a stunt like that. He’d be better off actually dead!”I wiped away the tears and grabbed my purse.“You’re right, I need to let him go.”I left and went home.The house was silent. It’d been this way for three months. I hated the silence. I’d started leaving all the lights on, brewing a cup of his favorite tea and putting it on the coffee table, pretending he was still there.I just didn't understand. If he didn't want to be married to me anymore, he could have just filed for divorce. Why fake a skiing accident and disappear?I sat on the couch and picked up the two cartoonish figurines of us he'd given me.“When I’m not here,"" he’d said, grinning, ""these little guys can keep you company.""His words clashed with the annoyed tone I’d heard at the bar.“Chloe was sweet and chill before we got married, but now she’s way too clingy. This fake-out will teach her a lesson and she’ll lay off.”Jamie had poured him another shot. “Well, at least I never cling to you! We've been buds for years.”“You’re the best, man,” he'd replied.They called themselves “bros” but their legs were intertwined.The thought made my stomach churn.I chucked the figurines in the trash and grabbed my phone, sending a mass text:Mark Harrison passed away in an accident three months ago. Memorial service next week.Mark’s buddies started hammering me with texts, full of outrage.“How can you have a funeral if you haven’t found his body?”“Chloe, have you lost it? Mark's not dead!”“If Mark comes back and sees his own memorial service he’s gonna lose it! Chloe, think this through, do you want to make Mark angry?”I didn't reply to the first texts, only to the last:“He’s dead. He’s beyond being angry now.”I tossed my phone aside and started packing up Mark’s stuff.For the past three months, I had been searching for him in the mountain town where he was “skiing,” and barely been home.The bedroom was mostly as we'd left it.I opened his closet and froze.His clothes were gone, like half of them, and all that was left were the items he’d never wear at this time of year.Tears started to fall.I had spent three months looking for him, and he’d been sneaking back here to grab his crap whenever I wasn't around.2.I pulled up the security footage and fast-forwarded through the last month.At the start of the month, Mark had walked in with his arm around Jamie, leaving two hours later with a ton of clothes.Mid-month, he’d carried Jamie into the house, and Jamie hadn't left till the morning.A couple of nights ago, they'd come home under the cover of darkness, leaving early yesterday morning.I had been looking for him in the next state over when these things had happened.I watched the screen as tears streamed down my face, not for Mark, but for myself.How had I fallen for such a scum bag?I had been losing sleep, worrying about him, while he and his ""bro"" were sleeping in my house, maybe even my bed.I clenched my fist and willed myself not to start hyperventilating.The phone rang.I didn’t want to answer but it kept ringing.I took a deep breath, got up and looked at the caller ID.It was Mark's uncle, Ben Harrison. I quickly answered. “Uncle Ben, is everything okay?”“Mark’s not dead.”He sent a video.It was Mark and Jamie doing a sake bomb, their eyes glued to one another.My breath hitched, and my fingers trembled as I spoke. “I know he’s not dead.”The man sounded surprised, but then laughed. “Then why are you planning a funeral?”“Everyone kept saying he was dead. I wanted to believe it. So, he gets a funeral.”Ben was silent for a second. “So you’re saying you’re widowed?”“Yeah,” I replied.Ben Harrison was Mark's uncle by adoption, and I barely knew him.He was the first person to tell me straight up that Mark was alive. I felt like I owed him something for that.“If you’re free next week, you can come to the service.”“I will.”Then another video came through.Mark’s friends are showing him something on their phone and he throws his drink. Jamie puts her hand on his chest like she’s trying to calm him down.The bar was too loud for me to hear, but I could see Mark's face soften. He even buried his face in Jamie’s shoulder.He must have seen my mass text, and he got pissed. And, somehow, just a few words from Jamie had soothed him.Whenever he got mad at me, he’d make me spend the night thinking about what I did wrong. Only then he would forgive me.I closed my eyes, saved the videos, and set the phone down.Right then, Jamie called.I answered, and the loud music in the background nearly deafened me.Jamie was shouting. “Chloe! Are you planning a memorial service for Mark? Are you crazy? Cancel that thing now! If he ever sees it when he comes back, you’ll be sorry!”Before she finished, I hung up, grabbed a blanket, and crashed on the couch.It was the first good sleep I’d had in three months.The next morning, I went down to the courthouse to get Mark declared officially deceased.Once I got the paperwork, I went to Jamie’s place.Her front door was closed, and it took me several tries on the doorbell before I heard footsteps.She was wearing a silk robe, leaning against the doorframe, and there was evidence of a good time all over her neck and collarbone.“Oh, it’s you. What do you want?”I glanced at her neck, then her face, which held nothing but contempt.“I wanted to invite you to Mark’s memorial service. Seeing as you were his ‘best bro’ after all.”Jamie rolled her eyes and sneered. “Chloe, you’re his wife. He went missing three months ago. Instead of looking for him, you’re just planning a funeral?“What if he’s not dead? Are you trying to wish him into his grave? What kind of a wife does that?”I pulled the death certificate from my bag, laughing. “He's been under the snow for three months. I couldn't find him, so he's officially dead now.”“That’s what everyone told me to do. To move on.”When I’d gotten the bad news, I’d fainted.The next morning all of Mark's friends were sitting around my bed.""Honey, the area he went missing is really dangerous, it’s going to be hard to find anyone. Maybe you should just give up.”""Yeah, it's a lost cause.""I’d gotten up, booked a ticket, hired a rescue team and headed to the mountains.For two and a half weeks I didn’t sleep or eat.I hadn’t noticed then, how there wasn’t any panic in any of his so-called friend’s eyes. Just amusement.Jamie’s jaw dropped, and then I heard a crash from inside her apartment.She glared at me and warned, “Don’t pull anything stupid. When Mark gets back you’ll be sorry!”I ignored her, like I had the night before, and walked away.3.The argument from behind her door was loud.Now that he heard that I declared him officially deceased, Mark was starting to lose his mind.But I wasn't going to let him find me.If he could disappear for three months, I could certainly be gone for a few days.I grabbed a packed bag and asked Sarah to book a hotel room for me using her name and ID.I've been hiding out at the hotel for the past few days, buying funeral supplies and that's it.Sarah showed up looking smug.“I hear some dude is tearing up the city looking for you. Dude's flipped out. They're all over the news.""I watched the news, seeing a missing person poster with Mark’s face and smiled. “He can look all he wants. I won’t let him find me. When he said he wanted to make me sweat and then come back, why is he sweating now?”“He deserves it, the jerk. Why does the world have such awful men in it?”She was getting worked up, and I had to cut her off, ""Hey, it's my husband's funeral today, I'm supposed to be sad, remember?""I got out my makeup bag, and turned myself into a hollow, sad, wreck.Once Sarah was certain I looked miserable enough, we left for the funeral.On the way, I gave her a USB drive with all the videos of Mark and Jamie, and told her to play it when I gave the signal.Only then did I send out the funeral address.First to arrive was Ben. He stepped out of his black car and took a white flower from me, pinning it to his lapel. ""My condolences.""Next came the clueless relatives.Their grief was genuine, and it made my heart ache.Mark, you fake your own death, and you hurt the people who actually care about you.Today, you’ll pay for it.Finally, his “bros” arrived.They all looked pale and sick, and their hands trembled when they took their flowers.One of them dragged me to the side.“Hey, honey, you need to stop this! Mark is not dead! He’s going insane looking for you! Have you seen the missing person posters?”I blinked, and let out two tears.“Don’t try to cheer me up, those missing posters were Jamie’s idea.”""A dead man cannot return to life. I’ve given up hope that he will.""He tried to say something but I nodded to Sarah, who grabbed his arm and sat him down.Once everyone had arrived, I got up on stage, and adjusted the mic.“Thank you all for coming to the memorial service for my late husband...”A scream cut me off.“Chloe! What the hell are you doing? I said Mark isn’t dead!”Jamie was standing at the entrance, glaring at me.“Are you even his wife? How can you have a funeral when he’s been missing for three months? I won’t let you!”I looked behind her. Mark wasn’t there.So, even now Mark still wasn’t going to show his face.I glared back at Jamie, “You won’t let me? Who are you to tell me what to do? You just said it yourself, I’m his wife.”Jamie stared at me, tears filling her eyes. “How can you be so cruel? Mark loves you so much. How can you just declare him dead like that?”“What if he isn’t?”My eyes went to her marked neck and I smiled. ""Even if he isn’t, I don’t want to waste my time on a cheater.”I had Jamie dragged off to a side and continued with the service.I was about to say something when a disheveled looking man appeared at the door.“Honey, I’m not dead! I’m back!”Chapter 24.Mark ran to me and pulled me into a tight hug, shaking as he whispered my name.“Chloe, you have no idea how much I’ve missed you.”“I fell while skiing and broke several bones. Luckily, a kind soul got me to the hospital. It took me three months to heal before I could see you.”“I’m alive, look! I’m right here!”He grabbed my hands and made me feel him all over, like he needed to prove he'd really had a brush with death.I just watched him act.Once he finally noticed how awkward he looked, I laughed.""Are you done now?""""The kind soul that took you to the hospital...that was Jamie, right?""Mark froze.He tried to look confused. “Chloe, what are you talking about? I don’t understand.”I watched him fake confusion. After three months of being lied to, I slapped him.“You hid from me for three months. Why didn't you just stay hidden?""Weren’t you planning to show your face once I'd gone crazy looking for you? I'm not crazy yet.",1,1752039141.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best linen table runners stand out due to their superior quality, design, and functionality. These features ensure longevity, aesthetic appeal, and ease of maintenance, making them a worthwhile investment for any home.

**Material quality:** The quality of the linen used is paramount. Premium linen table runners are crafted from 100% natural flax fibers, known for their durability, absorbency, and breathability.

The flax fibers are carefully woven to create a fabric that is both strong and soft to the touch. Look for runners that specify the origin of the linen, as European flax is generally considered superior due to its longer fibers and stricter cultivation practices. the weight of the linen, measured in grams per square metre (GSM), also indicates its quality; higher GSM values typically correspond to a denser, more durable fabric.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The design of a linen table runner extends beyond just its color and pattern. It encompasses the weave of the fabric, the finishing touches, and the overall aesthetic appeal.

The best runners feature intricate weaves that enhance their texture and visual interest. Hemstitch detailing, mitered corners, and carefully selected dyes all contribute to a refined and complex look.Some runners also feature subtle embroidery or printed patterns that add a touch of personality without overwhelming the natural beauty of the linen.The color palette should be versatile enough to complement a variety of table settings and decor styles, ranging from classic neutrals to vibrant hues.

**Size and Dimensions:** Selecting the right size of linen table runner is crucial for achieving the desired aesthetic. The runner should be proportionate to the size and shape of your table, allowing it to drape gracefully over the edges.

A general rule of thumb is to allow for an overhang of 6 to 12 inches on each end of the table. For a standard rectangular table, consider runners that are between 72 and 108 inches long. Square and round tables may require shorter runners, typically ranging from 54 to 72 inches. It's also crucial to consider the width of the runner, which typically ranges from 12 to 18 inches, depending on the desired proportion and the size of your centerpieces.**Care and Maintenance:** Ease of care is a meaningful factor when choosing a linen table runner. while linen is known for its durability, it also requires proper handling to maintain its quality and appearance.The best runners are machine washable and dryer safe, making them easy to clean after use. However, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully to avoid shrinkage or damage. Linen tends to wrinkle easily, so ironing or steaming is frequently enough necessary to achieve a crisp, polished look. Pre-washed linen is also a good option as it minimizes shrinkage and provides a softer,more relaxed feel.

**Durability and Longevity:** A high-quality linen table runner represents an investment in your home decor, so durability is key.the construction and treatment of the fabric play a significant role in determining its longevity.

Look for runners that are made with reinforced seams and edges to prevent fraying. Linen that has been treated with a stain-resistant finish can also help to prolong its lifespan by protecting it from spills and stains. Proper care, including gentle washing and avoiding harsh chemicals, will further extend the life of your linen table runner.

Lena was the royal family’s most beloved little princess.

From a young age, her father had carefully selected four sons of dukes as potential candidates for her future husband.

In her previous life, when asked whom she wished to marry, she had blushed and chosen Ethan, the one as cool and distant as the moon.

But less than a year into their marriage, he died, and she spent the rest of her life in mourning.

It wasn’t until her twilight years, during a visit to Slivershade, that she unexpectedly saw him again—alive. He was beneath an apple tree, holding the Chancellor’s daughter Flora in his arms as they kissed tenderly.

In that moment, everything became clear. He had already given his heart to someone else. His faked death had been a calculated escape—a clean break from his duties, so he could spend his life with the woman he truly loved.

Later, when assassins attacked, he died protecting Lena.

With his last breath, he said, “Princess, I know I was wrong to fake my death and deceive the crown. But my heart belongs to Flora… If I can trade my life for hers, then in the next life… please, don’t choose me.”

She closed her eyes, tears falling. When she opened them again—

“Lena, among these four, which one would you like to choose as your future husband?”

…

That familiar voice made her whole body tremble.

She looked up to see her young father smiling warmly at her. Four portraits lay neatly arranged on the desk in front of him.

She had been reborn—back to the very day she was to choose her fiancé!

“You’ve been following Ethan around every day—surely he’s your pick? If so, I’ll issue the decree at once—”

“No!” she nearly shouted, her voice so sharp it startled even herself.

Her father froze. “What’s wrong?”

Clutching her sleeve tightly, memories from her past life flashed before her eyes. Ethan’s final words—”Don’t choose me”—stabbed into her heart like a blade, leaving her breathless from the pain.

“I… I won’t choose Ethan.”

Panicked, she reached out and grabbed one of the portraits at random. “I choose him!”

She opened it and nearly bit her tongue.

The young man in the painting wore striking red robes and a cocky, devil-may-care smile.

Linden!

How could she have picked this nemesis so blindly?

“Linden?” Her father’s mustache practically jumped in shock. “Haven’t you two been enemies since childhood? Last time he got your kite stuck in a tree, and you chased him across half the royal gardens!”

Lena stared blankly at the portrait.

Linden, Asteria’s notorious dandy, always at odds with her. In her previous life, he had later become Admiral, remained unmarried all his life, and reportedly died defending the border.

“Lena, are you sure about this?”

She drew a deep breath. “I’m sure. I choose him.”

In her last life, she and Linden were just incompatible as fire and water, but looking back, those playful fights and quarrels had brought her more warmth than the cold, distant marriage she’d had with Ethan.

Perhaps this was fate. Given another chance at life, she would take the road never traveled.

Her father considered for a moment, then finally picked up his pen again. “Very well. That Gale boy may be unruly, but he’s talented in both combat and strategy. I’ll prepare the decree—your wedding will take place in ten days.”

When she stepped out of the royal study, decree in hand, her palms were damp with sweat.

She suddenly recalled how, in her past life, she had once rushed joyfully to tell Ethan the “good news,” only to be met with his cool response: “Your Majesty’s command is my duty.”

As she turned the corner, four familiar figures surrounded her.

“Who did you choose?” asked the ever-playful Alexander, waggling his eyebrows.

The Lucian who had always been gentle smiled. “Isn’t it obvious? Of the four of us, the least likely candidate is Linden. If he and the princess got married, they’d probably tear down the entire castle. The most likely is Ethan. After all, princess followed him around since she was a child…”

Lena couldn’t help glancing at Linden and Ethan.

Linden leaned lazily against a column, completely disinterested.

Ethan stood beneath the eaves in an ivory linen shirt, sunlight tracing the lines of his face like a sculpture from the Renaissance—so perfect, so noble.

It was that knightly image that had deceived her in her last life. She was about to speak when, suddenly, he dropped to one knee.

“I have already given my heart to another. I beg you to let me go.”

Lena’s heart clenched violently.

That hadn’t happened in her past life.

His pained yet resolute gaze struck her with a terrifying thought—

Had he also been reborn?

Was that why, in this life, he wouldn’t even pretend for a year? Was he truly willing to defy the king just to be with Flora?

“Do you understand the consequences of defying a royal decree?” she asked, hearing her own voice tremble.

“I’m willing to renounce my title and accept exile,” Ethan said firmly, lowering his head in a heavy bow. “All I ask is to leave with the woman I love.”

So this was what it felt like to be heartbroken beyond words—so painful it almost made her laugh.

Lena felt something twist sharply inside her heart.

Was being with her truly so unbearable? In the last life, he made her mourn him for decades. In this one, he wouldn’t even endure her presence for a few days?

She almost wanted to scream, saying that she didn’t choose him!

But the words stuck in her throat.

He had made her suffer for so long in the past. Why should she make things easy for him now?

At the very least, let him suffer for ten days.

She clutched the decree tighter. “The king’s command has already been issued. It cannot be defied. As for whom I’ve chosen… I will announce my betrothed in ten days when I welcome him into my castle. All of you have to attend my ceremony.”

With that, she turned on her heel to leave, only to bump into something soft at the corner.

She looked down and saw Flora sitting on the ground, teary-eyed, just like she had been in her past life—timid and fragile.

Like a frightened rabbit, Flora dropped to her knees, banging her forehead on the ground so hard it turned red. Tears welled up in her eyes.

“I’ve offended the princess. Please forgive me!”

Before Lena could respond, a white blur rushed over.

Ethan stepped in front of Flora protectively, his eyes blazing with an anger Lena had never seen before.

“Your highness, Flora already apologized. Why must you humiliate her like this?”

“Did I let her do this?”

Lena’s entire body trembled with fury. This was just like her previous life—every time they met, Flora would put on this pitiful act, making Lena look like some vicious villainess. But when had she ever harmed her?

Ethan didn’t even wait for an explanation. He bent down to help Flora up.

In his haste, as he turned with Flora in his arms, his elbow struck Lena’s side. She lost her balance and fell backward, hitting the back of her head hard on the stone steps.

Amid the searing pain, she heard chaos erupt around her.

In the blur of her fading vision, someone ran toward her.

“Lena!”

How strange… it was Linden.

His usual carefree face was filled with panic—panic, and something else she had never seen in his eyes before.

Was it… concern? Even love?

She must have hit her head too hard…

# Chapter 2

When Lena woke up, her temple was still throbbing faintly.

“Who brought me back?” she asked, her voice hoarse.

The maid Alice was just coming in with a tray of medicine. At the question, she smiled with her lips pressed together. “It was the Earl Gale . He carried you all the way back from the Royal Garden. The physicians were so alarmed, they thought something terrible had happened.”

Lena froze. “Linden?”

“Yes, Your Highness,” Alice nodded.

Lena recalled that fleeting moment before she lost consciousness. Her heart stirred slightly. “Did he… say anything? Did he seem worried?”

Alice tilted her head thoughtfully. “The Earl Gale looked as nonchalant as ever. He laid you on the bed and said he was going out for a bit of fun. He also said something like—”

She imitated Linden’s lazy, drawling tone, “Since I’m not in the running for fiancé, I might as well enjoy some wine at Slivershade. But rest assured, I’ll be back for the princess’s grand wedding—with quite the gift.”

The cloud over Lena’s heart suddenly lifted, and she nearly laughed out loud.

He was her future husband. What kind of wedding gift was he planning to give?

In the days that followed, all of Asteria buzzed with tales of Ethan and Flora’s blooming romance—

“The Earl Sterling visited Chancellor Castle again this morning. I heard he personally stewed cream of mushroom soup for Miss Vivian!”

“That’s not all. At yesterday’s auction, the Earl spent a fortune on jewelry—he bought out the entire gallery for her!”

“Someone even saw him carrying Miss Vivian, since she twisted her ankle, all the way down Central Avenue this morning!”

Alice stamped her foot in frustration. “Your Highness, do you hear this? No matter how noble and upright the Earl Sterling may seem, he was chosen by the King to be your future husband! He belongs to you! Flaunting his affections for another woman so openly—isn’t that a slap in your face?”

Lena looked out the window, watching the apple blossoms drift down in the breeze, and suddenly smiled.

Yes, it was a slap in the face.

“Bring me the gold-trimmed wooden chest from the storage room.”

When Alice brought it over, Lena casually flipped through it. Everything inside was something she had collected about Ethan.

A poem he had written offhand, a pendant he had discarded, even an old quill he no longer used…

The chest was filled to the brim with her humble affection.

“Prepare the carriage. We’re going to Sterling Castle.”

When they arrived, Ethan was not there.

The butler informed them he had gone to the outskirts to admire the spring blossoms—with Miss Vivian.

Lena ordered told them to carry the chest into his study and was just about to leave when she heard footsteps outside the door—

“Ethan, you’ve been so nice to me lately. If the princess finds out, won’t she be terribly upset?”

It was Flora’s voice.

Soon after, Ethan’s warm and gentle voice followed. “I’ve been deliberately letting people spread word of my affection for you, hoping the princess will give up.”

“But she’s so fond of you. How could she?”

“Even if she chooses me, I’ll find a way to break it off. Flora, ever since I saw you dance the Flamenco at the banquet, I’ve been captivated. In this life, I’ll marry no one but you.”

Lena felt as if she had been struck by lightning.

Flamenco?

Wasn’t she the one who had danced it?

That night, wearing a crimson gown and a veil, she had danced to celebrate her father’s birthday—clapping the castanets in rhythm with the guitar, twirling gracefully under the lanterns. Ethan had arrived late and never saw the face behind the veil.

Could it be… he had mistaken Flora for her?

Lena stumbled backward and accidentally knocked over a vase on the table.

“Who’s there?” Ethan pushed the door open. When he saw her, his brows furrowed. “Princess Lena, what are you doing here?”

Lena looked at his cool, moonlit face and suddenly found it all laughable.

In her past life, he had given up everything to love Flora. And yet, in the end, he hadn’t even recognized the person who had truly moved his heart.

She nearly blurted out the truth, but after a moment, she suppressed the surge in her chest.

Perhaps they truly weren’t meant to be. After what he’d done—faking his death—there could be no future for them.

“I came to return something,” she said, stepping aside to reveal the chest.

Ethan’s face instantly darkened. “The wedding isn’t for some time. Are you really so eager to deliver your dowry already?”

“I’m not—”

“I urge you to reconsider the chose of fiancé,” he interrupted coldly, his tone like frost. “My heart belongs to Flora. A forced union will never be sweet.”

Lena’s fingertips trembled with anger.

In all of Asteria, how many noble sons longed to marry her? And yet to him, she was something to be avoided at all costs!

She almost shouted, “I didn’t choose you,” but just then, Flora let out a dainty cry and collapsed to the floor.

“Oh, Ethan, I twisted my ankle…”

Ethan immediately bent down to pick her up and carried her into the inner chamber without so much as a glance at Lena.

Lena stood outside the doorway, watching him carefully apply ointment to Flora’s foot and whisper gently, “Does it hurt?”

That tenderness—was what she had yearned for in her past life, but never received.

Ethan, you’re blind—

You can’t even recognize the person who truly stirred your heart.

In that case, you deserve to live the rest of your life in regret.

Lena slowly closed her eyes, then turned and walked away.

# Chapter 3

In the days that followed, Lena stayed shut away in the princess’s castle, preparing quietly for her wedding.

Until one day, a maid burst in, flustered and breathless.

“Your Highness, Earl Sterling is here to see you!”

“I won’t see him,” Lena replied without even looking up.

The words had barely left her mouth when the door was kicked open with a loud bang—

Ethan stormed in, his white shirt stained with blood, eyes bloodshot.

“Lena, why did you poison Flora?!”

Lena froze. “Poison? What are you talking about?”

“Just because I said I admired her that day, you stooped to this cruelty?” Ethan seized her wrist, gripping it so tightly it felt like he might crush the bone.

“You’re coming with me!”

Lena stumbled from the force of his pull, fury rising. “How dare you!”

But Ethan paid her no mind and dragged her straight to Castle Vivian.

The moment they entered, Lena saw Flora lying in bed, blood trickling from the corners of her mouth. Her face was as pale as a sheet.

A doctor knelt by the bedside.

“Miss Vivian has been poisoned with a toxin especially made by the Fords. The only antidote requires the blood of the one who administered it. Without it… she won’t live more than three days.”

Ethan stared at Lena coldly. “What do you have to say for yourself? Flora hasn’t stepped outside these walls. You were the only Ford she met.”

“Why would I poison her?”

“Because you fancy me, and I fancy her!”

Lena stood rooted to the spot, stunned by the absurdity.

Flora suddenly began coughing violently, staining the sheets red with blood.

“Hurry!” the doctor urged. “If she doesn’t take the antidote now, it’ll be too late!”

Ethan shut his eyes. When he opened them again, there was only grim resolve.

“Forgive me.”

With that, he gave an order, and several servants stepped forward to restrain Lena by her shoulders.

“Ethan!” Lena struggled. “I am the princess! How dare you—”

“Don’t forget who you serve,” Ethan said, his voice cold as ice.

“I’ll take full responsibility.”

The servants didn’t dare disobey and held Lena down with force.

“Let me go!” she cried, struggling with all her might.

“I didn’t poison her!”

Ethan didn’t respond. He drew a dagger, and its cold gleam flashed in the light—

“Ah!”

The moment the blade sliced across her wrist, Lena trembled in pain.

She had always feared pain the most. Her tears flowed uncontrollably.

Ethan’s hand seemed to falter for a split second, but he quickly steeled himself, silently collecting bowl after bowl of her blood.

“You’ll regret this…” Lena’s voice was barely audible, her mind blurred by agony.

“I won’t,” Ethan said firmly.

“If I can save Flora, I’ll do whatever it takes.”

Before darkness claimed her, Lena thought she heard the sound of her own heart breaking.

——

When she woke again, she was back at the princess’s castle.

“Your Highness!” Alice threw herself at the bedside, her eyes red and swollen from crying.

“Earl Sterling went too far! You’ve been terrified of pain since you were little…”

Lena looked down at her wrist, now wrapped in layers of gauze. The pain was excruciating.

“Where’s Ethan?”

“He’s outside… asking for ninety-nine lashes to atone for what he’s done to you.” Alice sobbed.

“But what’s the use of atonement when you’ve been hurt like this?”

She clutched Lena’s hand and cried harder.

“Princess Lena, I beg you—please, stop loving him… He’d risk his life for Miss Vivian. Why should you…”

Lena closed her eyes and murmured softly,

“I stopped loving him a long time ago.”

Before she could finish, the door suddenly swung open.

Lena looked up—and there stood Ethan, covered in blood, his wounds raw and ugly, his face pale as death.

“What did the princess just say…?”

# Chapter 4

Lena had just opened her mouth when Ethan, as though not caring to hear her response, spoke first.

“The situation was dire. I’ve already asked for punishment. If the princess is still angry, put your anger on me.”

He paused, his eyes growing cold.

“But please, don’t take it out on Flora. And… don’t harm her again.”

He held the whip out with both hands, as if saying—if you’re still not satisfied, take it out on me yourself.

Lena looked at the blood-stained whip and suddenly laughed.

“You love her that much?”

“Yes,” Ethan said without hesitation.

“She’s the one who told you I poisoned her?”

Ethan was silent for a moment before replying, “This has nothing to do with Flora.”

“Just answer yes or no.”

“…Yes.”

Lena’s nails dug into her palm.

“So between me and her, you chose to believe her?”

“Yes.”

Three cold affirmations. Each one cut like a knife, shattering the last trace of hope in her heart.

Just then, a guard rushed in to report, “My Lord, Miss Vivian has awakened. She’s crying and asking for you.”

Relief flooded Ethan’s face. He gave Lena a quick bow.

“I must go.”

He turned and walked away without looking back.

Lena stared in the direction he’d gone, her voice quiet.

“Mistaking glass for a gem… Ethan, I’ll be waiting for the day you regret this.”

——

While recovering, Lena kept to her chambers.

She didn’t step outside until an invitation to the Easter banquet arrived.

At the banquet, Ethan came too—bringing Flora with him.

Though they weren’t seated together, Ethan attended to her every need.

He poured her wine, offered her a handkerchief when she sweated, all with such tenderness that it made the noble ladies at the table burn with envy.

“Earl Sterling really does dote on Miss Vivian…”

“He does indeed. I heard when she was poisoned days ago, Earl Sterling even went to the princess’s castle himself…”

The whispers suddenly died away.

All eyes drifted to Lena—but she acted as though she hadn’t heard a word, sipping her coffee in silence.

“Just painting Easter eggs is a little dull,” someone suggested suddenly. “Why not make it fun with a talent show?”

Someone quickly chimed in, “With Princess Lena here, who dares show off? I still remember the flamenco dance at her birthday banquet—it was breathtaking…”

Clink—

The glass in Ethan’s hand trembled, spilling red wine.

He looked up sharply at Lena, his eyes full of disbelief.

She could dance flamenco too?

Flora’s face turned ghostly pale. Her fingers clenched the edge of her sleeve tightly.

Lena glanced lazily in their direction, a faint smile tugging at her lips.

“I wasn’t lucky enough to see that banquet myself,” someone said, cheering.

“Would we have the honor of witnessing Princess elegance today?”

Voices of agreement followed one after another.

Under Ethan’s stunned gaze, Lena rose slowly from her seat.

“Of course.”

Just as she was about to begin her dance, Flora let out a sudden cry and knocked over her wineglass, drenching herself in red wine.

“Ethan…” she whispered tearfully.

Ethan immediately stood up.

“Excuse me.”

He left the banquet with Flora in a hurry—and did not return even after Lena had finished her dance.

After the banquet ended, Lena stood alone by the lakeside.

“Your Highness.”

Flora’s voice came from behind her.

Lena turned, surprised to see that Flora hadn’t curtsied this time. She let out a soft chuckle.

“What’s this? Dropping the act already?”

Flora bit her lip, then suddenly knelt.

“Your Highness, have you… found out the truth?”

“Found out what?” Lena asked, feigning innocence.

“I’m guilty!” Flora kowtowed hard, her forehead striking the ground. “It was I who led Earl Sterling to believe the wrong person. I deserve to die!”

Her eyes were red, her voice choked with emotion.

“I’m not the chancellor’s first-born child. I lost my mother young, and survived under a stepmother’s cruelty. Life has been bitter. I’ve never asked for much—only Earl Sterling. I beg you to let him go and spare me the truth…”

“In all the realm, there is no man you cannot have,” she sobbed.

“Please, I beg you—let me have Earl Sterling…”

# Chapter 5

“What if I refuse? ” Lena stared coldly at Flora.

Flora’s expression changed instantly. Her eyes darkened as she stepped closer and closer to Lena. “Then don’t blame me for being rude.”

Before Lena could react, Flora suddenly shoved her into the lake!

Icy water rushed into her nose and mouth. Lena struggled to surface. “Flora! Murdering a princess is a serious crime that leads to the gallows! ”

But Flora crouched by the shore, reached out, and pushed Lena’s head down hard into the water. “If no one knows, who’s going to find out?”

The rippling water blurred Lena’s vision. She thrashed desperately, but Flora’s strength overpowered her.

Just as her consciousness began to fade, footsteps rang out in the distance.

“H-Help…” Lena summoned every ounce of strength to cry out.

Flora’s face twisted. She quickly let go and threw herself into the lake as well. “Help! The princess fell into the water!”

Through her blurry vision, Lena saw Ethan rushing toward them. Without hesitation, he dove in and swam straight to Flora, pulling her into his arms.

“Ethan…” Flora leaned weakly against his chest. “Forget about me… save the princess… she’s far too precious…”

Ethan held her tightly, his voice filled with worry and tenderness. “What do you mean precious? You’re the one I treasure most.”

As the lake water flooded her lungs, Lena finally lost consciousness.

…

“The princess! The princess is awake!”

Lena opened her eyes to see Alice’s tear-streaked face hovering above her.

The young maid burst into even louder sobs the moment she saw her awaken. “It’s all my fault—I never should have left you alone…”

The memories from before she fainted rushed back, piercing through her heart.

She forced herself upright, but immediately noticed Alice’s uneasy expression. “What is it?”

Alice sniffled and shook her head. “N-Nothing…”

Lena frowned. “Tell me the truth.”

Alice finally broke down, weeping. “The Earl Sterling… he came by just now…”

Lena’s brows furrowed. She didn’t believe Ethan would come to see her.

Sure enough, Alice choked out, “He said… he said the princess should stop using such lowly tricks. That harming Miss Vivian again and again would only make him hate you more…”

“I tried so hard to explain. I told him you would never do such a thing. But he only believed Miss Vivian. Said she would never lie…”

“I just can’t stand it! All these years—you searched rare books for him, embroidered handkerchiefs by candlelight, even nursed him when he was ill… And what does he do? He won’t even spare you a second glance!”

In the past, Lena would have trembled with rage.

But now, all she felt was exhaustion.

She reached out and gently wiped Alice’s tears. “Don’t cry.”

“Soon, he’ll have nothing more to do with me.”

Alice froze. “Princess, what do you mean? Isn’t the Earl Sterling supposed to move into your castle after the wedding?”

Lena didn’t explain that her future husband wasn’t Ethan. She only said softly, “You’ll know soon enough.”

In the days that followed, Lena remained at the castle, quietly listening to the ever-growing rumors of Ethan’s unrestrained affection for Flora.

He took her to every jewelry salon in Asteria, even bidding on an extremely rare blue diamond for her. At the Royal Opera House, he placed a family heirloom tiara on her head in full view of the golden box seats. He even refused to attend a royal banquet simply because Flora had come down with rose fever that day—he insisted on staying by her side at the castle to care for her.

Everyone could see that Ethan was making a public statement: he had no intention of being Lena’s husband.

And yet Lena remained silent.

Not until the royal hunting expedition—an event mandatory for the court and nobility—did she finally leave the castle.

As she stepped out of the carriage, she saw Ethan helping Flora onto a horse. He stood behind her, arms around her waist, guiding her hands on the reins.

The sunlight bathed them in a golden glow, making them look like a perfect couple.

For a moment, Lena was reminded of a distant memory—beneath the apple trees in Slivershade, where they had once embraced and kissed.

She turned her head away and pretended not to see.

“Lena!” The king waved to her. “The woods are full of wild beasts during the hunt. You’re far too precious to go without protection.”

He looked around. “Where are the four earls?”

Ethan, Lucian, and Alexander rode over, but Linden was nowhere to be seen.

“Where’s Linden?” the king asked with a frown.

Lucian laughed. “Have you forgotten, Your Majesty? Linden went off on a trip.”

“Outrageous!” The king’s beard bristled with anger. “At a time like this? Doesn’t he realize Lena is about to be married?”

Alexander chimed in, “It doesn’t matter whether Linden’s here or not. The princess would never choose him anyway.”

The king glared. “Why not? Lena clearly—”

“Father!” Lena interrupted quickly. “It’s time we entered the hunting grounds.”

# Chapter 6

The royal hunt had begun, and Lena was flanked on both sides by three earls, shielding her at the center.

Flora trailed behind them at a distance, her eyes red, as if she had just been crying.

Lucian lowered his voice. “Did anyone else notice the king looked... off just now? Almost like Linden had to be here.”

Alexander nodded. “Yeah, everyone knows the princess would never choose Linden. So what if he’s not here? As long as Ethan’s around, that’s all that matters.”

Lena remained silent. She didn’t tell them that the man she intended to choose as her future husband—was precisely Linden.

Ethan’s expression turned cold. “Enough.”

Lucian and Alexander exchanged a glance, then looked at Flora, who was following behind, eyes brimming with tears.

“Ethan, we were all selected to serve the princess,” Alexander said with a chuckle. “Can’t blame you for being the best. If she’s fallen for you, what can we do?”

“Just forget Miss Vivian already.”

Ethan tightened his grip on the reins, his voice like ice. “I can’t.”

Lena’s heart skipped a beat. She opened her mouth to speak, but before she could, a sharp whistling cut through the air.

“Assassins! Protect the king!”

Dozens of black-clad figures burst out from the forest, arrows raining down like a storm.

“Protect the Princess!”

Lucian and Alexander immediately drew their swords and rushed forward to meet the attackers. Ethan positioned himself in front of Lena, shielding her.

But then, Flora screamed, “Ethan!”

Without hesitation, Ethan turned his horse and charged toward her.

“Ethan!” Lena shouted after him.

He didn’t look back.

An arrow tore through the air, heading straight for Lena. There was no one left by her side—she was about to be struck—

Clang!

A sword sliced through the air and shattered the incoming arrow.

Lena looked up, her breath caught—

Linden?!

She had no idea when he had returned. Dressed in a crimson hunting coat, a roguish smile played on his lips. “Hold on tight.”

Dazed, Lena wrapped her arms around his waist. She watched, wide-eyed, as he wielded his sword with unmatched skill, cutting down enemies like a whirlwind.

The assassins kept coming, driving them toward the edge of a cliff.

Linden glanced back at her. “Do you trust me?”

Lena gritted her teeth. “I do.”

His grin deepened. “Good.”

Without another word, Linden wrapped one arm tightly around her waist and leapt off the cliff.

—

When Lena opened her eyes, she found herself lying in her bed at the princess’s castle.

“Where’s Linden?” She sat up abruptly, only to gasp in pain as the movement tugged at her wounds.

Alice rushed to support her. “Don’t worry, Your Highness. Earl Gale is safe—just a few minor injuries. He’s back at the castle recovering.”

She handed Lena a cup of hot tea and couldn’t help but marvel, “Who would’ve thought? He always acts so carefree, but in the moment of crisis, he was incredibly dependable. He held you the entire time during the fall. And he knew there was a lake at the bottom—said you wouldn’t die from the drop.”

Lena took the cup, her emotions in turmoil.

Just then, Alice brought over a large chest. “This arrived from Earl Gale. He said he picked up a few things while passing through Slivershade and thought you might want to take a look when you woke up.”

Inside, the chest was filled with beautiful trinkets—

A lace fan from Venice, rose-scented powder from Glass, and even a box of maple almond confections wrapped in gilded parchment.

All things Lena loved.

Her fingers trembled as memories surged back from her previous life.

Linden used to bring her gifts every time he traveled. He’d always say it was something he picked up on a whim, nothing worth fussing over.

But looking at these items now—wasn’t every single one of them tailored to her exact taste?

Even after he was stationed at the border, he still found ways to send her things. Sometimes a bird feather, sometimes a handful of sand. And each time, there was a note attached:

“You’ve spent too long in Asteria. Let me show you the rest of the world.”

“Your Highness,” Alice suddenly remembered, “Earl Sterling has been waiting outside, asking to see you. You were unconscious, so I turned him away. Now that you’re awake, should I let him in?”

“What’s he doing here?”

Alice hesitated, her expression troubled. “Miss Vivian fell from her horse. Her injuries are severe… The physicians say she may not survive the night. Earl Sterling came to beg for the mandrake flower to save her.”

The mandrake flower.

A life-saving gift bestowed upon Lena by her father—said to heal fatal wounds and restore flesh to bone. There was only one in the entire kingdom.

# Chapter 7

Lena rose and pulled on a robe. “Take me to him.”

Outside the castle gates, Ethan stood at the foot of the stone steps in a linen shirt. The Earl Ethan, always impeccably dressed, now looked disheveled—his hair in disarray, a streak of dried blood still visible at his temple.

When he saw her emerge, his expression shifted, and he strode forward quickly.

“I beg you for the flower,” he said.

Lena looked at him calmly. “I only have one datura flower. If I give it to her, what am I supposed to do afterward?”

“In the future, I’ll protect you with my life.”

“Like you protected me during the royal hunt?” Lena gave a faint laugh.

Ethan’s face went pale. “That was an accident… Flora got separated. I couldn’t just leave her alone…”

“Datura is rare and precious. I won’t give it away for nothing,” Lena interrupted. “Three conditions. Agree to them, and it’s yours.”

“Name them, Princess.”

“First, you’ll kneel here all night.”

“Second, on the day of my wedding, you must attend and hear the King’s decree. No excuses.”

“And third…” Lena paused. “I haven’t decided yet. Fulfill the first two, and we’ll talk.”

With that, she turned and walked away.

Ethan was proud by nature. He had never bowed to anyone. Kneeling here in front of the staff all night would shatter that pride completely.

Lena was certain he’d rather find another way than kneel.

But then a sudden sound came from behind.

Ethan had dropped to his knees, straight-backed and unyielding.

Lena froze, her heart jolting.

He really loved Flora that much?

If one day Ethan realized he had mistaken who truly moved his heart… how ridiculous that would be.

That night, snow fell heavily. Ethan did kneel the entire night.

By dawn, Lena pushed open her window and saw him still there in the snow, shoulders dusted white, his face pale as paper.

She tossed the datura flower down. Ethan caught it, his voice hoarse. “Thank you, Princess.”

“The wedding day…” he hesitated, then said in a low voice, “I’ll be there. To marry you.”

Lena was momentarily stunned, then it hit her.

Ethan actually thought she wanted him there to marry her?

How laughable.

She only wanted him to watch as she married someone else.

After Ethan left, Alice came to inform her that Flora had survived. Ethan had watched over her day and night without leaving her side.

Lena felt… nothing at all.

On the eve of the wedding, Lena stood before the mirror trying on her gown when a faint sound came from the window.

“Who’s there?”

A figure in black climbed through the window—Linden, holding a small paper parcel in one hand, his smile as roguish as ever.

“A wedding gift,” he said.

“The wedding’s tomorrow. Why now?” she asked.

“I might not be there,” Linden shrugged. “I’m thinking of going on a trip.”

“How dare you!” Lena glared at him.

Linden suddenly stepped closer. A flicker of something unreadable passed through his eyes. “Lena, do you really want me to stand by and watch you marry someone else?”

Lena was caught off guard and just opened her mouth to speak when Linden took a step back and smirked again.

“If you’re not afraid of me turning the ceremony into utter chaos, I’ll come.”

With that, he vaulted out the window and disappeared into the night.

Lena opened the parcel and drew in a sharp breath.

It was a bag of shelled pine nuts.

She had loved them since childhood, but because Ethan disliked their scent, she had stopped eating them altogether.

So Linden… knew?

He liked pine nuts too?

…

On the wedding day, the royal procession stretched for miles. Rose petals blanketed the avenue leading to the grand cathedral.

Beneath the city walls, crowds packed shoulder to shoulder, murmuring excitedly.

“The princess’s fiancé must be the Earl Sterling, no doubt about it!”

“Of course! Everyone knows she’s been in love with him for years. Who else could it be?”

The King ascended the city tower with Lena at his side, receiving the reverence of the people.

Ethan, Linden, Lucian, and Alexander stood in order below.

Atop the tower, the King smiled and began to unroll the decree.

But Lena stepped forward. “Father, let me announce it myself.”

She took the scroll from him and swept her gaze across the crowd.

Lucian and Alexander looked composed, clearly aware they were only stand-ins.

Flora glared at Lena with tear-filled eyes, her face twisted with hatred.

Ethan stood with his head bowed. He appeared calm, but his fingertips had turned ghostly white.

And Linden…

He leaned against a pillar with his arms crossed, that usual careless grin on his lips—yet in his eyes, there was something Lena couldn’t read.

She took a deep breath and unrolled the royal edict.

“In the name of God, by order of the King: By the power vested in the Crown, I hereby decree that a marriage contract shall be established between the Princess and the Earl Linden, effective immediately.”

The entire square fell into stunned silence.

Ethan snapped his head up, staring at Lena in disbelief.

Linden’s grin froze. His fan dropped from his hand with a loud clack.

Lena looked at his dumbstruck face and couldn’t help but laugh.

I really enjoy living in a large city and the vibrant feelings of life around, close to friends and amenities. Downsides would be the drive time to the trails, schools, and just not knowing how much I’ll do city things when a baby comes. I can get to good trails within 30ish mins.

Pros for the suburbs would be closer to family for childcare (also a con in some ways) and access to trail networks. Car centric but very safe and better schools. 

Just curious from other riders how priorities change when family life starts as mtbing is my main active hobby and my other hobbies all involve being in a city (music, coffee, friends, etc). 

I would probably enjoy a smaller city 50-100k people that has both aspects (Santa Cruz, Bend, Asheville) but cost is obviously insane for those places. Maybe it’s worth it for financial tradeoffs but curious to hear some opinions from strangers on the internet ☕️

1lvaf9q,https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/partner-visa-relationship-statement/,Your Partner Visa Relationship Statement – Don’t underestimate the power of a good love story,"Partner Visa relationship statements are my FAVOURITE part of a Partner Visa application. They are so heart-warming to read and for me put the whole application into context. An application just makes sense once I have read the couple’s relationship statements.

Without relationship statements, a [Partner Visa](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/) application simply isn’t complete. 

# What are your Partner Visa relationship statements?

If you’re not familiar with relationship statements, then this blog is going to be your best friend. Relationship statements, otherwise known as or referred to as your ‘statutory declarations’ are your unique love stories. They paint the picture of your relationship and should provide a [detailed account of your relationship](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/four-pillars-partner-visa-evidence/) history and how you manage various aspects of your lives as a couple. 

A relationship statement in a Partner Visa can be the difference between a [visa refusal](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/partner-visa-refusals/) and visa grant. Your statements are your opportunity to explain various aspects of your relationship. Not just to explain, but to fill in the gaps. If your application doesn’t tick all the ‘conventional’ evidence boxes, for example not having [joint bank accounts](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/financial-pillar/) or perhaps you live your lives on the road together and so you don’t have [joint lease agreements](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/nature-of-household/), then your relationship statements are where you explain your individual relationship. 

# Why should I provide a relationship statement?

Think of your relationship statements as the final piece of the puzzle that demonstrates your commitment to your partner and your shared life together. It should be a powerful narrative convincing the decision maker that you are in a commitment, mutually exclusive relationship. Simply put, your relationship statement is going to give the decision maker so much more context than simply looking over [documents](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/partner-visa-australia-checklist/).

# How long should they be?

I have had clients provide relationship statements for their Partner Visa that were just one page long, and have had others 20 pages long! Over the last 9 years of reading relationship statements, I believe I’ve found the sweet spot for how long they should be.

A one page statement is not nearly enough to cover everything you should be covering (we’ll come to the content of the statements soon). A 20 page statement is also arguably too long. You want to keep the decision maker engaged with your statement. If your statement is too long then you run the risk of having it skimmed through and potentially having the decision maker miss some of the most important points.

So what’s the magic number? I would recommend keeping your relationship statement between 4-6 pages. From the thousands of statements I have read, this seems to be the perfect balance of giving the decision maker enough insight into your relationship and addressing all the [key components of your relationship](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/four-pillars-partner-visa-evidence/), but still making sure its succinct and easy to follow.

Keep in mind that this is a guide only. Depending on your case, and remember that each Partner Visa is unique and different, you may need more or less pages.   

# What information should a relationship statement cover?

You should be writing your relationship statements using clear headings. As your starting point, you should be talking about the development of your relationship. This includes information detailing when you met, where you first met and how your relationship started to develop. Ideally, you want to keep this content to one page.

You’re then going to move into talking about the ‘[four pillars](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/four-pillars-partner-visa-evidence/)’. Remember that when the decision maker is assessing whether or not you meet the criteria for a Partner Visa, they will assess your relationship against four different factors. These are:

1. [The financial aspects of your relationship](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/financial-pillar/)
2. [The nature of your household](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/nature-of-household/)
3. [The social aspects of your relationship](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/social-aspects/)
4. Your commitment to one another (also called [Nature of Commitment](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/navigating-nature-of-commitment/))

As a general rule of thumb, try to keep the content of each of these [four pillars](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/four-pillars-partner-visa-evidence/) to half a page long. You will find that with some pillars you may need to provide more information than others.

Here are some ideas and guides to talk about under each pillar:

# The financial aspects of your relationship

Here, the decision maker wants to understand how you manage your finances and how you pool your finances together.

* Describe how finances continue to be managed between both of you
* Do you have joint bills?
* Have you made any joint purchases?
* Do you have any loans together?
* Do you have a Will in the other person’s name?
* If you don’t have a shared bank account how do you manage your finances and why?
* Moving forward (in the future) how will the finances in your relationship be managed?
* Is there something you are saving for together? Do you have some shared financial goals?

# Nature of your household

Under this section, you want to give the decision maker a recount in your daily life and what it looks like. For example who wakes up first in the morning, who makes the coffee/tea, who does the washing, who does the cooking, who does the driving, who pays the bills, who cares for the children, do you have extended family you’re responsible for (i.e. an elderly person). 

There are of course situations where couples do not live together when a Partner Visa is submitted, or even afterwards. Your relationship statements are a great place to talk about your living arrangements and if you are [not living together](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/partner-visa-not-living-together/), why?

* Who does the cleaning/washing/ household chores?
* Do you have joint responsibility for raising children or pets? If so talk about this
* Who is responsible for managing the bills? Talk about your shopping routine, who drives and how you live together as a couple.

# Social aspects of your relationship

Under this section, you want to explain to the decision maker what your social life looks like. For example, do you do things together when you’re not working, do you plan your social activities and attend them together, do your friends/family and the people that matter to you know about the relationship or is it a secret? It’s important the decision-maker is left with an understanding of what you do together socially, if you present yourselves as being in a relationship publicly (i.e. with friends/family) and if you’re viewed by friends/family as partners.

* Describe the social activities you do together
* Talk about how you plan your social activities. Do you make plans together? Do you introduce each other as partners or friends?
* Describe which members of your family and friend circles know about your relationship
* Talk about your holidays together
* Talk about joint attendance at events together
* What clubs/church/sport or recreational groups do you belong to?

# Commitment to one another

This section is designed to show Immigration just how serious your relationship is. This is done by firstly looking at the strength of your relationship at this point in time (up until now) and then by talking about your plans for the future together.

* Have you experienced any difficult periods together where you have provided emotional support to each other? If so, explain this. Please give anecdotal examples.
* Talk about the degree to which you rely on each other for support
* Talk about sacrifices you have made for each other
* Talk about your knowledge of goals/plans or things your partner wants to achieve in the future and how you will support him/her with this
* Talk about why it is you love your partner, what had you fall in love with your partner and why they are important to you.
* What do you have in common? What shared values do you hold? What makes your relationship strong/long lasting?
* What are your plans for your future together?
* Do you plan to have children? Do you plan to buy a house? Do you plan to get married? Do you plan to travel? Do you plan to study? Do you have pets together?

# Who needs to write a relationship statement?

For an Australian Partner Visa, both the applicant (person applying for the visa) and the applicant’s partner (known as the sponsor – the Australian Citizen/Permanent Resident sponsoring their partner) need to complete relationship statements.

It’s not sufficient or insightful if only one party is providing a statement. The statements should be written separately by both parties.

Oftentimes a couple believes their friends and family also need to provide relationship statements. But what they are referring to are actually [witness statements](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/ultimate-guide-to-partner-visa-witness-statements/).

I always recommend submitting your relationship statements as soon as your Partner Visa is lodged. This is best practice to ensure the case officer has all the information they need to make a decision, so make sure your statements are signed and ready to go!

# Avoid these common mistakes

Getting your relationship statements right are really important. At the end of the day, you’re wanting to make the decision maker’s life (and in turn your life) easier. 

You’ll find that I love my analogies so here’s another one. Imagine you start reading a book but realise the first and last chapters are missing. You can still read the book but it just won’t make as much sense. You need those first and last chapters to complete your book. That’s the same as your relationship statements. You need them in order to complete your application.

Here are my top tips on what to do, and what to avoid when writing your statements:

 

**DO** cross check dates and information. Consistency is key. Not just when it comes to your relationship statements, but the entire application. If you are stating that your relationship started on 01 January 2021, then your partner’s statement should also reflect the same date.

 

**DON’T** copy each other’s statements. Your statements are your opportunity to talk to the decision maker, to speak in your own voice, write your own memories of your relationship and how you work together as a couple. Continuously looking at your partner’s statement will on some level make you write a similar statement to theirs, which you want to avoid.

 

**DO** your grammar and spelling checks. A well written statement reflects your commitment to the process, professionalism and attention to detail. It pays off to do your checks.

 

**DON’T** be vague. The whole point of a relationship statement for a Partner Visa is to provide insight into your relationship. The decision maker won’t be getting any if you’re vague and generic in your recount of the relationship.

 

**DO** get a translator. If you or your partner does not speak, read or write English then we recommend they write their statement in their native language and have an English translation complete by an [accredited interpreter](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/settling-in-australia/settle-in-australia/language-services).

 

**DON’T** write your partner’s statement. Why? If your partner’s level of English is not the same as yours it will be very clear to the decision-maker that it was not actually written by the person signing it.  I could tell straight away when I read a couple’s relationship statements if they were both written by the same person. One of the statements will always lack authenticity and even the style of writing, the words they choose to use and the formatting of the statements is close to exact. It’s easy to spot when one person is writing and it comes off as lazy.

# What else should you cover in your relationship statements?

Relationship statements are also a great place for you to talk about or ‘speak to the case officer’ about your immigration history. If you are the visa applicant, you should provide a brief overview of any previous visas you have held and your current visa (if you are in Australia).

If you have ever been refused a visa, your relationship statement is again a great place to talk about the reasons around why your visa was refused.

# Statutory Declaration or statement?

There’s no formal requirement from the [Department of Home Affairs](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/) around what the formatting of your relationship statement for your Partner Visa should look like.

My preference is to always provide your relationship statements in the form of a Statutory Declaration. This is because a Statutory Declaration is a legal document and may hold more weight. There are of course situations where providing a Statutory Declaration is not possible, and that’s okay too.

# Key takeaway points

If you remember anything after reading this blog, let it be these three main points:

1. Your relationship statements should be given the effort and energy they require. It’s important to sit down and detail your relationship history and go into detail around the [pillars of evidence](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/four-pillars-partner-visa-evidence/).
2. Write your own statement. Don’t share your statement with your partner until they are both completed.
3. Cross check your statements at the end, along with your [application forms](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/partner-visa-forms-free-guide/), documents, [witness statements](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/ultimate-guide-to-partner-visa-witness-statements/) to ensure there is no inconsistency across the information and dates provided.

At The Partner Visa Academy, we [review each couple’s application](https://thepartnervisaacademy.com.au/how-it-works/#review) including both relationship statements before they lodge their application. This gives our couples the peace of mind to know everything is covered and there are no inconsistencies.

Analyn is 19 years old. She just graduated from senior high school with honors and dreams of becoming a doctor. She’s smart, responsible, and the kind of girl her teachers always say has “a bright future.” Her mom teaches MAPEH in a public school, and her dad is a barangay kagawad. They’re not dirt poor, but money is tight, especially with three younger siblings.

One afternoon, she gets the news: she’s been accepted into Davao's Doctor's College and she even got a small academic scholarship. She's ecstatic.

That night at dinner, she excitedly tells her parents, expecting hugs or at least some celebration. Her mom smiles softly. Her dad, however, just keeps eating. After a long silence, he says flatly:

That night, alone in her room, she scrolls through TikTok. Her feed is full of Filipinas with older foreign boyfriends,  dining at buffets, going on beach trips, flashing new phones. The captions offer advice:

>

Curious and desperate, Analyn downloads Tinder.

The floodgates open. Local men offering hookups, married men looking for “discreet fun,” foreigners asking for pics. One guy even offers ₱5,000 to meet that night.  
She ignores them. Just noise, and she's not cheap. 

Then she sees *Daniel*.  
An American in his late 40s. Average looking. Slight belly. Not flashy. His photos show him golfing, walking his dog, eating at quiet restaurants. His bio says, “New in Davao. Looking for something genuine.”

She messages him:

>

They chat. He’s respectful, not pushy. They agree to meet for coffee.

When they meet, he’s awkward but kind. He listens. She laughs at his stupid jokes. They go back to his condo. They sleep in the same bed but she doesn't let it go too far. Not because she’s head over heels, but because she wants to feel in control of something. And because she’s scared this might be her only shot at tuition, at getting out.

Then something unexpected happens. He doesn’t hint at her to leave. He makes her tea. He asks about her dreams. What she likes to cook. What it’s like living in Davao de Oro. It’s the first time a man, especially a foreigner,  has seen her as more than just a pretty face or a warm body. All the other foreigners she met before were broke, controlling, or just looking for a free nurse. 

They meet again. And again. Daniel buys groceries; she cooks for him. They watch movies. He opens up about his divorce, his quiet life back in the U.S., and how he came to the Philippines hoping to find something real and a lower cost of living.

Analyn starts liking him. Not for money but for who he is.

But TikTok keeps whispering:

>

So she pulls away. Leaves his messages on seen. Makes excuses when he invites her over. Keeps him guessing.

One day, he invites her to Samal for the weekend. She says she has a family thing.  
Daniel starts to pull back too.

She panics a little. Sends him a photo of her  lying on her bed, in shorts and a tank top — with the caption:

>

He replies:

>

She stares at the message, unsure whether to feel flattered or guilty.

Then Daniel messages that he’s flying to Cebu for a few days on business. Analyn feels the loss creeping in but instead of saying *come back safe*, she types:

>

Not because she wanted a gift,  but because she wanted to feel in control again. To remind herself she was still the prize.

Daniel stares at the message.  
He can afford it. That’s not the issue.  
But something about the *tone* of it cuts deep and he has an ego too.   
He thinks: *I chose her when I had dozens of girls in my inbox calling me “baby.” She should know that.*

They ghost each other.

Two years later, Analyn is still young, still beautiful and still sifting through messages from creepy men who only want her for a night or to send them shirtless pictures.   
Daniel is still in Davao, still financially secure and still being chased by women who see him as a walking wallet.

They still think about each other from time to time.  
But pride, ego, and a little bit of heartbreak keep them both silent.",0,1752037050.0,Philippines_Expats,3,0.14,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of an upholstered bench often hinges on specific features that cater to individual needs and preferences. Examining the technical specifications, material qualities, and design elements is crucial for making an informed purchase.

**Upholstery Material:** The durability and feel of the upholstery significantly impact the longevity and comfort of the bench. High-quality fabrics like linen, velvet, or leather are often preferred for their resistance to wear and visual appeal.

A bench upholstered in premium velvet offers a luxurious feel and a refined look. Velvet is known for its soft texture and rich color saturation. A High thread-count linen provides a breathable and durable surface. leather upholstery, although pricier, provides excellent resistance to stains and wear, making it ideal for high-traffic areas.

**Frame Construction:** The underlying frame determines the stability and weight capacity of the bench. Solid hardwood frames, such as those made from oak, maple, or beech, are known for their strength and durability.

A Bench with a solid hardwood frame is more likely to withstand daily use and last for many years. Engineered wood, like plywood or MDF, can offer a cost-effective option, but it should be constructed with high-quality adhesives and joinery to ensure structural integrity. Steel frames offer modern aesthetics and are exceptionally strong.

**Dimensions and Weight Capacity:** The bench's dimensions should align with the available space and the intended use. It’s crucial to consider both the length and width.

A Bench designed for an entryway should be narrow enough not to obstruct the pathway,while a bench for a dining area needs to accommodate multiple sitters comfortably.The weight capacity should be appropriate for the number of people expected to use it. Most quality benches are rated to withstand at least 250 pounds per seat.

**Leg Design and Material:** The legs of an upholstered bench contribute significantly to its overall style and stability. Tapered wooden legs, metal legs, or upholstered legs can each create a different visual effect.

A Bench featuring a Mid-century modern bench might have splayed wooden legs, while a contemporary design could feature sleek metal legs. The material should be durable and well-attached to the frame to prevent wobbling or instability. The leg height should also be considered, as it affects the overall seat height and ease of use.

**Cushioning and Support:** The cushioning material and support system beneath the upholstery dictate the comfort level of the bench. High-density foam provides firm support and resists sagging over time.

A Bench with a combination of foam and springs offers a balance of comfort and support.Some benches may also use coil springs or webbing for added cushioning and resilience. The thickness and density of the cushioning should be appropriate for the intended use.

**Style and Design Aesthetics:** The aesthetic design of the upholstered bench should complement the existing decor. This includes the shape, detailing, and color of the bench.

A Bench styled with tufted detailing and nailhead trim can add a touch of elegance, while a streamlined, minimalist design blends seamlessly into contemporary spaces. The color and pattern of the upholstery should also coordinate with other furnishings in the room. Consider neutral colors for versatility or bold patterns for a focal point.

Hey everyone, I’m a 24 M from Canada, new to solo travel and planning a ~2‑week trip late July/early August to South America. Thinking of flying into Bogotá, spending a few days in Colombia (like Bogotá, Medellín, maybe the coffee region), then crossing into Ecuador to explore Quito, Cotopaxi, and maybe Montañita or Cuenca one day per city or region max.

My Spanish is very basic. I’ll be staying in hostels, using budget buses or cheap internal flights. I have a flight booked to Bogotá (~CAD 700) and aiming for an overall budget of about CAD 1,000–1,500 including that flight.

How realistic is my plan to be done in 2 weeks ish. Also  what travel hacks can yall give me? Can you give me tips on survival 

Is this feasible? Any tips on:
• managing the land border crossing into Ecuador (you need a criminal record check that’s apostilled, right)?
• translation apps or survival tips if I speak minimal Spanish?
• how to budget effectively and book cheapest routes/accommodation?
• any must‑see stops or places to skip?
• any tips on nightlife, nature, hiking, beaches on a tight schedule?

During our 1st month he came clean to me about his past. His body count did not matter to me. What bothered me was he is still in touch with his most recent ex fubu. This ex fubu of his was a childhood friend so they go waaaay back. Sabi nya they ended it because nag-iba ugali nung girl nung naging fubus sila so they went back to being friends. Tried to accept it kasi past is past and it had nothing to do with me. Feeling ko kasi pag may contact ka pa sa fubu mo there's some unresolved feeling or unfinished business. Ang hassle kasi sa kanila they've been friends since high school so parang legit naman yung staying in touch nila after all that.

One weekend nahuli ko sya bringing coffee for her kasi tatambay daw sila with other friends sa bahay ni exfubu. Nagulat lang ako kasi di nya pinaalam sakin na may ganun pala syang plano e long weekend yun. I was expecting na magkasama kami the whole weekend.

1lva6hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1lva6hw/i_honestly_felt_ashamed_of_myself_today/,I honestly felt ashamed of myself today.,"I’m 33 lbs overweight. It’s low enough to think that maybe no one can see it, or if they can, that most men have the gut too.

I was only 10 lbs overweight getting my weight down until I started dating someone and eventually gave up trying to go straight to the gym to see them. It only takes a few misses for me to say what’s the point. Relationship ended and now I’m 30 lbs overweight again. I let a woman weaken me and in the end I’m overweight and single (she gained weight too so I’m at fault for feeding her too much).

Automatically, not even two weeks of no contact, and I started going to the gym again. So it’s my default, it is the relationship that distracts me (I’ll try not to let it happen from now on, but doubt I can be disciplined).

I felt ashamed seeing the regulars. Then I saw a woman who looked average when I last saw her, look extraordinary. I was shocked and envious that I could have looked great but failed.

Then I went to the sauna and made myself take off my shirt. I did it as a punishment and acceptance thing, but it felt shameful. And when I looked in the mirror, I, 34M, felt like I had the body of a 60-70 year old married father who was heavy. I didn’t just feel overweight, I felt too old and weird looking.

I’ve taken steps already: back to lifting 6 days a week hopefully. Walking before work and at lunch (10k steps), no breakfast, more black coffee, and maybe even just a protein bar for lunch.

I’ve never done just a protein bar at lunch. If I wake up at 6:30 am, have black coffee, protein bar at 12 pm, and eat dinner after 4:30-5, will it be sustainable? Can I get by one 200 calories until 5 pm?

(OCD, MDD, Panic Disorder, previous psychotic episodes. Last medically diagnosed episode was Jan 2023) 

I am currently only taking 250mg of clomipramine in the morning with 5mg of Valium as necessary for panic attacks. I use this VERY sparingly. 

In the past week or so I’ve had a consistently high heart rate while walking, standing, sitting and even lying down. I have an Apple Watch so I am recording when this happens- generally the rate is between 115-125BPM. 

My dad has a history of arrhythmia but that’s all in terms of family heart issues. The heart rate increases feel like a panic attack, but can last up to an hour at a time, and I can distinguish my panic from the heart rate rises pretty well most of the time even if I can’t stop it. 

I need to stress that this high heart rate is abnormal for me outside of a panic attack, which I know I am not having most of the time. I have not taken any medication to calm my heart. 

My doctors are not available until August earliest so I was wondering what I could try or if this is serious enough to warrant some other kind of medical attention. It is impacting my ability to work, but I don’t want to go to a random doctor if they’re just going to tell me it’s from my panic and not help. Thank you for reading!

1lva1ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1lva1ag/delonghi_autentica_stopped_making_coffee_pucks/,DeLonghi Autentica stopped making coffee – pucks not forming,"Hey everyone,

I have a DeLonghi Autentica ETAM29.510 that's been working perfectly until a few weeks ago. One day, the descaling light came on, but I didn't have descaler at the time, so I kept using it for about a week. Eventually, coffee stopped coming out of the spouts entirely.

I assumed it was due to scale buildup, so I stopped using it until I could get proper descaler. Once I had it, I ran the full descaling cycle, but the issue persisted: no coffee came out, and the machine stopped making proper coffee pucks. Instead, the used coffee grounds were dry and loose, [as you can see in the image](https://i.postimg.cc/NM0ts705/coffee.png).

This happened with both beans and pre-ground coffee.

Here's what I tried so far:

1. Cleaned the spout holes with a toothpick, as recommended in the manual — no luck.
2. Found [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgVhGn1iQbo&t=164s&ab_channel=CountryLifeontheCoast) and followed its steps: cleaned the infuser with warm water and applied food-grade lubricant to the O-rings and inside the piston. After this, it actually worked! Coffee started flowing, and pucks were forming properly... but only for 3 or 4 coffees. Then it stopped again. One random time it worked again, but the next few tries failed.

So now I'm stuck. The machine makes a grinding sound like it's brewing, but no coffee comes out. The grounds are still dry and loose, with no puck shape.

Is the issue most likely with the infuser piston, or could it be something else? What can I do if cleaning and lubricating didn't fix it?

1lva0e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lva0e8/i_need_adviceopinions_on_this_situation_with_a/,"I need advice/opinions on this situation with a ""friend"".","So this is gonna be very long so buckle up. I have to give the backstory on our friendship and the situation before I explain why this 1 text message upset me and honestly hurt me.

 I (20f) have known this girl (19f) since 7th grade. Let's just call her A. I had art class with A, we sat together and just kinda grew closer over time, started sitting together at lunch, etc. For the first couple years of our friendship, that's all it was. But over time, I started going over to her house once in awhile and spending the night. We would always have lots of fun. We'd cook together, laugh our asses off together, smoke a little, talk about boys, do face masks, classic sleepover shit. 

It's also worth noting that her sister (21) and my sister (20) were best friends. We will call her sister, B. My sister and B were so close they got matching tattoos together at one point. 

Anyways, I ended up moving out of town and going to live with a different friend of mine because my parents were getting a divorce and my dad was acting straight unsafe to be around. We ended up drifting for awhile, but we still talked occasionally. 

The friend I moved in with was really abusive to me, and at the time I had a long distance boyfriend who I ended up moving in with. During the entire 2.5 years we were together and living together, A and I rarely talked. 

My ex and I ended up breaking things off, and I ended up moving in with a friend of my moms until I figured out my living situation. I had literally nowhere to go. So I messaged A and sent her a really long and awkward text basically explaining the situation and asked if I could come stay with them just until I got on my feet. It was awkward because at this point, we still weren't talking a lot. 

She and her sister both live with their mom so they all 3 had to discuss it. A messaged me about a day later letting me know that her mom said yes and how excited she was and how much fun we were gonna have. I was excited too because I missed my friend. I missed talking to her and just being with her. 

About a week later, I move in. They had a 2 bedroom house (A and B shared a room) that now had to be shared by 4 people. B gave me her bed. I felt bad and expressed my feelings to them in which I was reassured multiple times that B had already been sleeping in the same bed as their mom for a couple months before I moved in because they couldn't share a room without fighting a bunch. 

For the first few weeks, I was struggling to get a job. Eventually, B got me hired at the same restaurant she used to work at. So I started working there, and then their mom brought up the suggestion that I go to the same school that A graduated from (I dropped out of high school when I was 16) (A moved schools after I dropped out) because it was smaller, self paced, and I could knock it out of the park super quickly if I worked really hard. I thought that was an amazing idea, and I was excited. My only concern was my age, but the school didn't seem to mind and was willing to let me attend. A, B and their mom kept talking about how excited they were for me, their mom even cried a little because it was a great opportunity and would really help me, B helped me straighten my hair the night before my first day of school, etc. They were also giving me rides to and from work because, at the time, I didn't have a drivers license (my parents kinda just left ne to figure shit out myself if you can't tell). Things were honestly great at first. 

However, once I started school, things really started to change in the way I was treated there, the vibes in the house, etc. They started to get annoyed at every little thing I was doing, and I felt like I had to walk on eggshells around all of them. They did things a lot differently than how I was raised. For example: they pre washed their dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. I've never even met a family that does that. I was always taught it's okay to rinse them really well with hot water and put them in. The FIRST time I did dishes at their house, B sent a group text to A and I telling us, ""if you can't do it right, don't do them at all."" instead of simply explaining to me and communicating like an adult how they wanted them done. 

They started talking about me behind my back. They would all be in the kitchen whispering, but the second I walked in, the conversation would just stop and they would talk like normal. I'm not stupid. I have eyeballs and a brain and know when someone is talking about me. 

There was an instance where the towel rack fell off the wall of the bathroom (while I was sitting on the couch mind you), and their mom went absolutely BALLISTIC. Yelling about how we don't respect anything in the house, how she's not made of money, etc. Later that night, I was sitting on the bed, and I could hear A and B talking in the bathroom and saying stuff like, ""This looks like it was broken off. At least we know WE'RE not in trouble."" I knew instantly they were talking about me. I dont use the towel rack. I have ALWAYS put my towel either on the toilet lid or on the bathroom counter. That's just something I've always done, and it was really frustrating that I was instantly blamed for that. 

Getting me to and from work also became an issue even though it wasn't before. They kept saying they didn't have the time to take me to work, I got off too late for them (10pm) because they all went to bed at 9, etc. There were a couple times I would have to either leave work early or get a ride home from my manager or else I would have no ride home. And we lived too far for me to walk, otherwise I would have. 

I didn't have any control over my own money. I was only able to work like 5 hour shifts at a time because I was in school. I didn't make much at all. Maybe $400 biweekly if I was lucky, and pretty much every single dime I made went to their mom. I remember I went with MY mom to help her out with something and spent $30 on dog toys and a new collar for my dog (side note: they HAPPILY let me bring my dog because they love dogs), and their mom went crazy texting me how it was ungrateful and selfish because all of the bills fell on her, she feels like she has no help, etc. The bills did not all fall onto her. Me, A, and B all gave her money for bills. If they wanted to go get a damn $8 iced coffee, they would have to hide it from their mom so she wouldn't get mad. 

I told my mom about how she was acting about me spending $30 and showed her the texts messages, and my mom was livid. I'm a grown adult, and I help out with bills as much as I possibly could with the money that I was making. What I spend my money on apart from bills is really none of her damn business. 

At that point, how I was being treated was really starting to get to me and hurt my feelings. I was starting to get into a really bad headspace mentally, and I DREADED going home after school every day because it meant there was going to be SOME sort of issue I would have to deal with. Every single day in that house was exhausting and miserable. I felt trapped and like I was living in a prison. I ended up having to quit my job because of the ride issue and the fact that I made jack shit money. I want to mention that their mom was on board and totally fine with it. Obviously I wouldn't have quit if she wasn't. But it was to a point where my depression was so bad living there, and the fact that they were constantly talking about me behind my back and acting normal when I was around was causing me to develop some pretty bad paranoia. A and B couldn't even spend sister time alone together without me having severe anxiety the entire time and thinking ""I know they're talking shit about me right now."" I genuinely at that point also started to believe that everyone was out to get me and had the worst intentions. Not even just them but classmates and teachers too. 

The last thing I'm going to mention about living with them was my personality and my looks were starting to be insulted, and I was having to change who I was around them just to be accepted enough for them to tolerate me. My natural hair is 2b, and they talked every day about how I should straighten my hair. I started straightening my hair at least 4-5 times a week (I wish I was kidding) which was literally DESTROYING my hair.  They would make comments about my outfit choices. I had a VERY different style than they did. I like to wear regular tshirts and leggings or sometimes sweatpants. I have a very basic style if you will. I hate jeans, dresses, skirts, that kind of thing. Their mom would have me try on clothes and talk about how I should dress more cute, etc. But those aren't the type of clothes I like or feel comfortable in, but I humored her to keep the peace. Their mom  also told me I laugh too loud and I talk too much. She told me that multiple times which really stung because I love talking to people, and I genuinely didn't think I talked more than the average person. 

My mom was more than aware of how I was being treated but never really said anything because there wasn't really anything she could do about it. But one night, we were all having a really bad night, and I went out into the driveway and just broke down and sobbed to my mom on the phone because of how miserable I was, how my feelings were being hurt all the time, how I was being treated, etc. I also want to point out that not once did A or B ever stick up for me in anything regarding their mom but instead would agree with them. They were all basically 1 person and 1 brain even though A talked so much about how much she wanted out of that house. 

Another thing worth noting: Remember how I said earlier that B and my sister were best friends and had matching tattoos? WHILE I was living there, B was actively ghosting my sister. She just stopped talking to her, would leave her on read, etc. I tried talking to B about it, and she never gave me a reason for it. 

Eventually, I dropped out of the school I was going to which was a really sad and emotional experience. I had earned 2 credits in the month I was there which was really good. I cried into my english teachers shoulder when I told her because of how sad I was and how fucked the situation was. I took a bus to where I was going next, and even after everything and how I was treated, their mom had the nerve to text me and say, ""I hope there's no bad blood between us."" 

Fast forward to now when I am in a much better living situation, A hardly talks to me at all, and B and my sister don't talk at all. 

The last actual conversation I had with A was in May when she asked if I was in town because she needed a break from her house.

I was going to attatch a picture, but it wont let me. During that conversation (very short btw, she dipped after finding out that I wasn't in town or of use to her), she told me I was her ""only trustable friend"". How are you going to say I am your only trustable friend when you hardly speak to me? Am I even a friend at all at that point? 

Before that was January. I have put effort into talking to her, but I am left on delivered for months every single time, and then she'll randomly pop back up, talk to me for like 3 minutes if that and then disappear. What upsets me the most is that she posts on her story almost daily, she has a long distance boyfriend who she obviously texts, etc. 

My sister and I have a lot of history with them. A was my best friend at one point, B was my sisters best friend at one point. I mean they literally got matching tattoos, and now it's almost like theyre refusing to speak to us. This all happend out of NOWHERE, and we have no idea what we did wrong at all. We were actively making effort into our friendships with them and they just vanished almost. I feel hurt and disrespected almost. At least give me the courtesy of explaining WHY you don't talk to me. They have been through a lot, and I understand that, but if you have time to post on your story every day, you can at least give me some closure.

I feel like me living with them definitely put a strain onto our friendship, but even when I was living with them, I did nothing but do everything they said and let them walk all over me to keep the peace between us. I conformed to their schedules, their way of doing things, I even stopped being myself and started being more like them. I also ALWAYS made it known how much I appreciated them letting me live with them. I never once gave the impression to them that I was ungrateful.

I could go for a walk, but I know that if I find someone with a cigarette, I WILL ask for one. And I know that I cannot be a casual smokers. It's all or nothing.

1lv9x0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepThisInMind/comments/1lv9x0j/can_you_make_espresso_with_regular_coffee_maker/,Can you make espresso with regular coffee maker?,"If you’ve ever wondered whether you can brew espresso using your regular drip coffee maker, you're not alone. The answer is **no**—at least, not real espresso. But that doesn’t mean you don’t have options.

Here’s a breakdown of **why a drip machine can’t make espresso**, what alternatives work, and how to get a similar result without shelling out for a $500 espresso setup.

# What Actually Is Espresso?

Espresso isn’t a bean or roast—it’s a brewing method. It involves **forcing hot water through very finely ground coffee at 9 bars of pressure** (that’s about 130 PSI). This pressure is what creates espresso’s signature thick, rich flavor and crema on top.

Your regular drip machine? It just lets hot water drip through coarse grounds using gravity—**no pressure**. So even if you use “espresso” beans or espresso grind, you’re not making espresso. You're making strong coffee—nothing wrong with that, but it’s not the same.

# What Happens If You Use Espresso Grind in a Coffee Maker?

You’ll probably clog your filter. Espresso grind is much finer than drip grind. Without the pressure of an espresso machine, water can’t pass through properly. This leads to:

* Over-extraction (bitter taste)  
* Water backing up in the basket  
* A sludge-like mess in your filter  

Multiple users on Reddit have tried this and reported exactly that—it either doesn’t brew properly or tastes like overcooked mud.

# Want Stronger Coffee Without an Espresso Machine?

Here are legit options that give you strong, espresso-style coffee without needing a $500 setup:

# 1. Moka Pot

Often called a ""stovetop espresso maker,"" it uses steam pressure (around 1–2 bars). It’s not real espresso, but the result is bold and rich. Works well in lattes too.

# 2. AeroPress

Use the inverted method with fine grounds for a super concentrated, espresso-style cup. Great for travel and super budget-friendly.

# 3. Manual Espresso Press (Flair, Robot, etc.)

If you want true espresso without an electric machine, manual levers can get you there—with a learning curve.

# Still Tempted to Try Espresso Beans in Your Drip Maker?

That’s fine—**just make sure they’re ground for drip**, not espresso. The term “espresso beans” usually just means a dark roast. You can grind them coarser (or buy them pre-ground for drip) and still enjoy that bold flavor without wrecking your brew.

# FAQs

**Q: Will using espresso beans in my drip maker give me more caffeine?** Not really. A 2 oz shot of espresso has \~80mg of caffeine. An 8–12 oz drip coffee? \~120mg. Volume plays a bigger role.

**Q: Can I mix ground espresso with regular coffee grounds in my filter?** Not recommended. Espresso grind is too fine—it can block water flow and ruin the brew.

**Q: Is instant espresso a shortcut?** Sort of. It’s just instant coffee labeled as “espresso” for flavor. Works in a pinch if you want to add a caffeine kick, but won’t taste like espresso.

# Final Verdict:

**A regular coffee maker can’t make espresso.** But if you want something stronger, you’ve got options. Use a moka pot or AeroPress, or just double up your drip strength and skip the grinder mistakes. It all depends on what you're after—taste, caffeine, or convenience.

1lv9us7,https://www.reddit.com/r/10s/comments/1lv9us7/how_to_fix_tennis_elbow_guide_from_a_physical/,How to Fix Tennis Elbow - Guide from a Physical Therapist Who Specializes in RSI,"Hey everyone!

I'm Dr. Elliot Smithson, a physical therapist with an organization called [1HP](https://1-hp.org/about-us/) and I've been specializing in repetitive strain injuries for over a decade. I've noticed quite a few posts recently asking about tennis elbow - how to fix it, why it keeps coming back, and whether surgery is necessary. Since this is such a common issue that affects players at every level, I wanted to put together a comprehensive guide that hopefully answers most of your questions and gives you a clear path forward.

I've been treating repetitive strain injuries in everyone from tennis players, to musicians, to artists, and gamers. The one thing all these populations have in common is repetitive strain injuries and I can tell you that tennis elbow is one of the most misunderstood and poorly treated conditions in sports medicine. Most players get stuck in cycles of rest, anti-inflammatories, and braces that provide temporary relief but never actually solve the underlying problem.

Let me break down exactly what's happening in your elbow, why it develops, and most importantly, how you can fix it yourself with the right approach.

# What Tennis Elbow Actually Is (And Isn't)

Tennis elbow, medically known as lateral epicondylitis, affects the tendons on the outside of your elbow. These tendons belong to your extensor muscles - the ones responsible for lifting your wrist up and stabilizing it during shots, especially your backhand.

Here's what's important to understand: despite the name ""tennis elbow,"" this isn't actually an inflammatory condition in most cases. When doctors first started seeing this injury, they assumed the pain and tenderness meant inflammation, hence the ""-itis"" suffix. But modern research has shown us that chronic tennis elbow is actually **tendinopathy** \- a breakdown of the tendon structure due to repetitive overload.

Think of your tendons like a rope made of thousands of tiny fibers. When you play tennis, each swing puts stress on this rope. Normally, your tendons can handle this stress and actually get stronger from it. But when the stress exceeds what your tendons can manage - whether from too much play, poor technique, or insufficient conditioning - those fibers start to break down faster than they can repair themselves.

This is why tennis elbow is fundamentally a **repetitive strain injury (RSI)**. It's not something that happens from a single bad shot or traumatic incident. Instead, it develops gradually over weeks or months as your tendons become progressively overloaded.

https://preview.redd.it/e639c1r51sbf1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=be2107e0fc4526fab5363768448eda832729efa7

Understanding how tennis elbow develops helps explain why certain treatments work and others don't. Here's the typical progression:

**Stage 1: The Overload Begins** You start playing more frequently, increase intensity, or change something about your game (new racquet, technique adjustment, or surface). Your extensor tendons begin experiencing more stress than they're conditioned to handle. At this stage, you might notice mild soreness after playing that goes away with rest.

**Stage 2: Early Tendon Changes** The tendon fibers start to show microscopic damage. The normally organized, rope-like structure becomes slightly disorganized as your body attempts to repair the ongoing damage. You start feeling stiffness in the morning or when you first pick up your racquet.

**Stage 3: Reactive Tendinopathy** Your tendons are now clearly struggling to keep up with repair demands. The pain becomes more noticeable during play, especially on backhands or when gripping the racquet tightly. Many players first seek treatment at this stage.

**Stage 4: Degenerative Changes** If the overload continues, the tendon structure becomes significantly altered. Pain is now present even with daily activities like lifting a coffee cup or shaking hands. This is where many players get desperate and start considering injections or surgery.

The key insight here is that tennis elbow isn't a sudden injury - it's the end result of a gradual process where your tendons couldn't keep up with the demands being placed on them.

# Why Traditional Treatments Often Fail

Most players who develop tennis elbow go through a predictable cycle of treatments that provide temporary relief but never actually solve the problem. Let me explain why the most common approaches fall short:

**Rest and Anti-Inflammatories** This treats tennis elbow like it's an acute injury with inflammation. While these might reduce pain temporarily, they don't address the underlying tendon weakness that caused the problem. Worse, extended rest actually makes tendons weaker and less capable of handling load when you return to play.

**Braces and Straps** Counterforce braces can provide some symptom relief by distributing forces differently, but they're essentially a band-aid. They don't improve your tendon's capacity to handle stress, so you become dependent on them. I've seen players who can't hit a ball without their brace because their tendons never actually got stronger.

**Steroid Injections** Recent research has shown that cortisone injections for tendinopathy can actually be harmful long-term. While they might provide a few weeks of pain relief, they can weaken tendon structure and increase the risk of future problems. The research is quite clear on this - avoid steroid injections for tennis elbow.

**Traditional Physical Therapy** Many physical therapy approaches focus on stretching and light strengthening with resistance bands. While these aren't harmful, they often don't provide enough stimulus to actually improve tendon capacity significantly. It's like trying to prepare for a marathon by walking around the block.

# The Real Solution: Understanding Load vs. Capacity

Here's the fundamental principle behind effective tennis elbow treatment: **Tennis elbow develops when the load on your tendons consistently exceeds their capacity to handle that load.**

Load = How much stress you put on your tendons (frequency of play, intensity, technique demands) Capacity = How much stress your tendons can handle (their strength and endurance)

This gives us two ways to address the problem:

1. **Reduce Load** (play less, modify technique, use different equipment)
2. **Increase Capacity** (strengthen and condition the tendons)

Most traditional treatments focus only on reducing load, which is why symptoms return as soon as you resume normal playing. The key to long-term resolution is increasing your tendon capacity so they can handle the demands of tennis without breaking down.

# The Science of Tendon Adaptation

To understand why certain exercises work for tennis elbow, you need to understand how tendons adapt to stress. This is where modern tendinopathy research has revolutionized our approach.

Tendons are living tissues that respond to load by becoming stronger and more resilient. However, they need the right type of stimulus to adapt properly. Recent research has identified that tendons respond best to:

**Progressive Loading**: Gradually increasing the stress placed on the tendon over time **Eccentric Exercise**: Emphasizing the lengthening phase of muscle contractions **High-Repetition Training**: Building endurance rather than just strength **Consistent Stimulus**: Regular, frequent loading rather than sporadic intense sessions

The most effective approach combines these principles into what researchers call ""tendon neuroplastic training"" - exercises that not only strengthen the tendon but also improve how your brain controls the muscles, leading to more efficient movement patterns.

# Your Tennis Elbow Exercise Program

Based on current research and clinical experience, here's a progressive exercise program that addresses the root cause of tennis elbow. Remember, consistency is more important than intensity - these exercises work by gradually building your tendon capacity over time.

# Phase 1: Isometric Loading (Weeks 1-2)

Start with isometric exercises that allow you to load the tendon without moving through range of motion. These help reduce pain while beginning the strengthening process.

**Isometric Wrist Extension**

* Sit with your forearm resting on a table, palm facing down
* Place your other hand on top and gently push down while trying to lift up with the affected arm
* Hold for 45 seconds at about 50-70% effort (should not increase pain)
* Rest 30 seconds between sets
* Perform 3 sets, twice daily

**Pain-Free Grip Strengthening**

* Squeeze a tennis ball or stress ball
* Hold for 10 seconds, release slowly
* Perform 15-20 repetitions
* Should feel effort but not pain

# Phase 2: Dynamic Strengthening (Weeks 3-6)

Once you can perform isometric exercises without pain, progress to dynamic movements that build both strength and endurance.

**Eccentric Wrist Extension**

* Hold a light weight (start with 1-2 pounds) with your palm facing down
* Rest your forearm on a table with your hand hanging over the edge
* Use your other hand to lift the weight up
* Slowly lower the weight with the affected arm (taking 3-4 seconds)
* Perform 15-20 repetitions, 3 sets
* Focus on the slow lowering phase - this is where the real benefit happens

**Tyler Twist (Eccentric Strengthening)**

* Hold a FlexBar or resistance stick with both hands
* Twist the bar by extending your wrist on the unaffected side
* Hold this twisted position and slowly return to neutral with the affected arm
* This creates an eccentric load specifically for tennis elbow
* Perform 15 repetitions, 3 sets

# Phase 3: Functional Training (Weeks 6-8)

As your tolerance improves, incorporate exercises that mimic the demands of tennis.

**Resistance Band Extensions**

* Attach a resistance band to a fixed point
* Hold the other end with your palm facing down
* Slowly extend your wrist against the resistance
* Perform 20-25 repetitions, focusing on control throughout the movement
* Gradually increase resistance over time

**Multi-Directional Strengthening**

* Perform wrist extensions in various positions (palm down, thumb up, palm up)
* This addresses the different angles and forces encountered during tennis
* 15-20 repetitions in each position

# Stretching and Mobility Work

Incorporate these stretches throughout all phases:

**Extensor Stretch**

* Extend your arm in front of you, palm facing down
* Use your other hand to gently pull your fingers toward your body
* Feel the stretch along the top of your forearm
* Hold for 30 seconds, repeat 3 times

**Prayer Stretch**

* Place your palms together in front of your chest
* Slowly lower your hands while keeping palms together
* Feel the stretch in your wrists and forearms
* Hold for 30 seconds

# Load Management: Getting Back to Tennis

The exercise program addresses the capacity side of the equation, but you also need to manage your tennis load intelligently as you recover.

**Week 1-2**: Focus on exercises only, no tennis **Week 3-4**: Light hitting for 15-20 minutes, focusing on technique **Week 5-6**: Gradual increase to 30-45 minutes, avoid intensive sessions **Week 7-8**: Return to normal playing volume if symptoms allow

**Key principles during return to play:**

* If pain increases during or after playing, reduce intensity or duration
* Focus on smooth, relaxed strokes rather than power
* Take breaks every 15-20 minutes during the first few weeks
* Consider temporary equipment modifications (lower string tension, different grip size)

# Understanding Your Recovery Timeline

Recovery from tennis elbow requires patience. Here's what to expect:

**Weeks 1-2**: Pain reduction during daily activities, improved tolerance to exercises **Weeks 3-4**: Noticeable improvement in grip strength, less morning stiffness **Weeks 5-6**: Able to return to light tennis without significant symptoms **Weeks 7-8**: Approaching normal function, can handle longer playing sessions **Weeks 8-12**: Full resolution for most players who follow the program consistently

Remember, everyone recovers at different rates. Factors like how long you've had symptoms, your age, and how consistently you perform exercises all influence recovery time. Players who have had symptoms for months may take longer than those who address the problem early.

# When to Seek Professional Help

While this program works for the majority of tennis elbow cases, there are situations where professional guidance is beneficial:

* Pain that doesn't improve after 2-3 weeks of consistent exercise
* Numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers
* Weakness that affects your ability to grip objects
* Pain that interferes with sleep
* Previous failed attempts at treatment

A physical therapist who understands tendinopathy can modify the program based on your specific presentation and help troubleshoot any issues that arise.

# Prevention: Keeping Tennis Elbow at Bay

Once you've recovered, preventing recurrence is straightforward if you understand the principles:

**Maintain Tendon Capacity** Continue with a maintenance strengthening program 2-3 times per week. Your tendons need ongoing stimulus to stay strong.

**Monitor Your Load** Be aware of sudden increases in playing frequency or intensity. Gradual progression is key - the ""10% rule"" applies to tennis volume just like running.

**Address Technique Issues** Poor backhand technique is a major risk factor. Working with a coach to improve efficiency can significantly reduce tendon stress.

**Equipment Considerations** String tension, racquet weight, and grip size all affect the forces transmitted to your elbow. Experiment to find what works best for your body.

**Stay Conditioned** General fitness and specifically forearm conditioning should be part of your regular routine, not something you only think about when injured.

# The Bottom Line

Tennis elbow is a solvable problem when you understand what's actually happening and address it appropriately. The key insights are:

1. It's a tendon capacity problem, not an inflammatory condition
2. Rest alone doesn't solve the underlying weakness
3. Progressive, consistent loading is the most effective treatment
4. Recovery takes time - usually 6-12 weeks with proper management
5. Prevention through ongoing conditioning is much easier than treatment

The approach I've outlined here is based on the latest research in tendinopathy and has been proven effective in clinical practice. Most players can successfully manage their tennis elbow without injections, surgery, or extended time away from the sport they love.

I hope this helps clarify what can be a frustrating and confusing condition. Tennis elbow doesn't have to end your playing career or keep you off the court indefinitely. With the right understanding and approach, you can get back to playing pain-free tennis.

For background my wife and I have been together for 15 years and have 3 young kids. 2 years ago she told me she was no longer in love with me and was considering a divorce. I am still in love with her but its been 2 years of me busting my ass to be the best partner, provider, father, and man possible but she is still totslly checked out and refuses to put in any effort to rebuilding our marriage. She likes that we have a very non-intimate, ""roommates"" kind of marriage.  

I understand the purpose of the 180 is really about improving yourself and prioritizing your own life and needs and not about getting your spouse to fall back in love. But I do hope it will help her decide to come back to our marriage in a meaningful way. 

So here are my questions:

-There was no infidelity. Can the 180 still be effective? I usually see it associated with affairs.

-My wife will frequently ask me to take her places. (Example, she will usually ask me to take her to Starbucks for a coffee first thing in the morning.) Really she just hates driving so I'm more of her chauffeur than her partner; she often wont even talk to me but just sit in silence and refuse to engage in any kind of conversation. 

Per the 180, should I be refusing that? We also usually watch a show together before bed. Should i stop that too? Overall how much together-time is ok? 

-What about sex? She has a very high libido; normally she takes care of it herself in private, but about once a month she will come to me for sex. If i try to initiate she will almost always say no. Should sex be off the table until things change?",1,1752035362.0,Marriage,1,0.67,False

Let me break down what you can actually expect when hiring a carpet cleaning company.

Most carpet cleaning companies will move lighter furniture like coffee tables, chairs, and small items. However, they typically won't move heavy pieces like beds, dressers, entertainment centers, or pianos. This is mainly for liability reasons and to protect their workers from injury.

I learned this the hard way when I first started my own cleaning business. Moving heavy furniture can lead to damaged items, injured workers, and costly insurance claims. That's why most companies now have clear policies about what they will and won't move.

If you want a thorough carpet cleaning under all your furniture, you have two options:

1. Move the heavy items yourself before the cleaners arrive
2. Clean the accessible areas only and leave the furniture in place

Here's what I've found works best: Get yourself a good carpet cleaner machine for regular maintenance. I personally use one I found on Amazon (https://explorehomedeals.com/Carpet-Cleaner) - it's perfect for cleaning under furniture because you can easily maneuver it yourself without worrying about liability issues.

What professional companies typically WILL move:
- Dining room chairs
- Coffee tables
- End tables
- Floor lamps
- Small ottomans
- Lightweight furniture

What they typically WON'T move:
- Heavy appliances
- Beds and mattresses
- Large dressers
- Entertainment centers
- Pianos
- Antique furniture
- Heavy bookcases
- Electronic equipment

Pro tip: If you're planning to hire a cleaning service, ask about their furniture moving policy during booking. Some companies charge extra for furniture moving, while others flat-out refuse to move certain items.

For maintaining your carpets between professional cleanings, I highly recommend getting your own carpet cleaner. I've found this one on Amazon (https://explorehomedeals.com/Carpet-Cleaner) to be particularly effective for regular maintenance. It's saved me hundreds on professional cleaning services.

Remember to always clear the area as much as possible before any carpet cleaning - whether you're doing it yourself or hiring professionals. This ensures the best possible results and prevents any potential issues with furniture damage or worker injury.

The bottom line is: don't assume carpet cleaners will move everything. Always check their policies beforehand and be prepared to move heavy items yourself or leave them in place.

That was the final straw. On the day of my the party, I gave them my last gift — my signed divorce papers and my wedding ring. Then, leave them. But, as I prepare to marry the man who truly loves me, Clinton crawls back, begging for another chance.

\--

“I’m agreeing to your marriage offer now,” I said into the phone, my voice barely steady. “Just… hurry up and pick me.”

There was a pause. Then a deep, confused voice replied on the other end, “You’re agreeing now? After rejecting it before? What about Clinton?”

“I’m divorcing him,” I said firmly. “So if you still want to marry me, come pick me up after one week.”

I hung up before I could hear his response.

My hand trembled slightly as I lowered the phone. I sighed, not from relief—but from exhaustion. My body ached in places I couldn’t name, and my heart felt like it had been stitched together with pins and broken promises.

A soft knock at the door snapped me out of my thoughts. A nurse entered, offering me a gentle smile.

“You’re ready to be discharged, Miss Moore. Here’s the last scan from your check-up,” she said, placing a printed image into my hand.

It was the ultrasound of my baby—my last photo with the little soul I never got to meet.

I stared at the black-and-white image. Seven months. I was seven months pregnant when the accident happened. When I lost everything.

And it was Alynna’s fault. My half-sister. We were on our way home. She insisted on driving, even though she was clearly drunk. I told her to pull over. She didn’t listen. Then the headlights came out of nowhere.

Crash. Screams. Blood. Shattered glass.

When I woke up in the hospital, the baby was already gone.

But the worst part? Alynna lied. She told everyone I had been the one driving. That I was the one drunk. That the crash was my fault.

She pinned it all on me. My father didn’t even ask for my side of the story. He stormed into the hospital two days after the crash—red-faced, livid, and full of disgust.

“You’ve humiliated this family again,” he spat. “Your half-sister is injured because of you. Haven’t you done enough damage already?”

Not once did he ask how I was doing. Not once did he mention the baby. Not once did he look at me and see his daughter.

But then again, he never really did. He never loved me. Not even as a child. I was the reminder of everything he hated—of the woman he once married and lost.

He blamed me for my mother’s death. She died in a car accident too, trying to rush home from work when I had a fever. I was only eight, but he never forgave me, even after he married Alynna’s mother who was actually his mistress.

“She wouldn’t have died if it weren’t for you,” he had said once, in one of his quieter fits of anger. “You cursed everything you touched.”

No one stood by me. Not one soul came to ask how I was doing. Not after the miscarriage. Not after the surgery. Not even after I begged someone to call Clinton. But unfortunately, he was busy treating Alynna who was faking her injury.

It was in that silence I knew. I had to leave before they completely ruined me.

I grabbed my small duffel bag, filled with folded clothes and pills I could barely pronounce, and made my way down the hallway of the hospital.

But fate wasn’t finished with me yet. I heard it before I saw them—familiar voices just around the corner.

Alynna and Clinton.

I froze, pressing myself against the wall, heart pounding.

“What about Chloe?” Alynna said, her tone cautious. “She’s going to lose it once she finds out I’m pregnant.”

My breath caught.

“And why would she get mad?” Clinton replied, not even bothering to lower his voice. “Our baby died because of her. It was her fault you got into that accident and got hurt. He should be thankful that you’re giving me an heir.”

My mouth fell open. I gripped the ultrasound picture in my hand tighter, my nails cutting into the paper.

“Thankfully our baby is safe,” he continued. “And it’s not like I ever loved her.”

“She’s still your wife,” Alynna said, voice laced with something almost mocking. “If you don’t love her, why not just leave?”

“You know I can’t do that yet,” Clinton muttered. “My grandfather hates divorce, and he adores Chloe for some reason. Still don’t know why. Marrying her was a mistake from the beginning. But don’t worry…”

I leaned closer, nausea rising in my throat.

“…at my grandfather’s birthday party next week, I’ll slip something in her drink. Set her up with someone. Then my grandfather will have to believe she was cheating, and I’ll be rid of her for good.”

Laughter followed. Their laughter.

And then Clinton added, “Doctor said you’re already three months, right?”

“Three months,” Alynna confirmed, giggling. “Our little heir.”

I didn’t wait to hear more. I turned, walked down the hall with every ounce of dignity I had left, and stepped into the first cab I could find.

Tears blurred my vision, but I didn’t let them fall. Not yet.

I reached into my bag, pulled out my phone, and dialed a number I’d been avoiding for weeks.

“This is Chloe Rose Moore,” I said when the line picked up.

“Yes, ma’am?”

“I want to file for divorce,” I said. “Immediately.”

Chapter 2

“I want to file for divorce,” I said firmly, clutching my phone like a lifeline. “Immediately.”

A pause on the other end. “Mrs. Moore… under your marital contract, both parties—especially the families—must be involved. Your in-laws must approve.”

“I don’t care.” My voice didn’t waver. “Just draft the papers and send them to me. Whether they sign or not, I’ll find a way.”

And with that, I hung up.

The silence in the hallway felt heavier after that. I hadn’t even made it to the gates of our home before I already felt like a stranger in it.

The moment I stepped inside, I sensed something had changed. No one greeted me. No one asked how I was. The air was colder, stiffer. My room, the one that had always felt like mine even when nothing else did, had been emptied. The curtains were different. The bedcovers were replaced. My dresser was filled with someone else’s things.

Alynna’s. Panic rising in my chest, I opened the cabinet only to find my belongings boxed up and shoved into a corner. Dusty, neglected. As if I had already been erased.

I hurried outside, searching for someone—anything familiar—and stopped short when I saw the maid near the garden, standing beside a small flame. A pile of items fed the fire: old jewelry boxes, yellowed letters, delicate fabrics. Things that looked painfully familiar.

I ran to her. “What is this? What are you burning?”

She turned with a hesitant look. “Miss Alynna said to dispose of the old things from storage… These were marked as ‘unnecessary.’”

My stomach turned. “These belonged to my mother!”

Just then, Alynna appeared behind me, holding another box in her hands. “Oh good, you’re here. I was just about to tell them to burn this one too. Dad said we’re clearing out old junk for the renovations. Sentimental clutter just slows things down.”

I stepped forward, my hands trembling. “That’s not clutter. Those are my mother’s memories. You don’t get to decide what stays.”

Alynna gave me a flat smile. “She’s dead, Chloe. She’s not coming back. And let’s be honest—you were the reason she died, weren’t you?”

The sting of her words landed harder than the slap I gave her.

She burst out theatrically. “Oh God—did you just hit me?”

Clinton appeared then, footsteps sharp, face unreadable. “What’s going on?”

“She slapped me,” Alynna sniffled. “I was just trying to help. Chloe got upset about some old things. I didn’t mean to upset her…”

Clinton turned to me. “What’s your problem? She’s trying to help and you lash out like this?”

“They were my mother’s,” I said, barely able to raise my voice. “And she’s throwing them away like they mean nothing.”

“So what?” he snapped. “She’s gone. We’re moving forward.”

And there it was. The truth, out loud. He had already left me in his heart. Maybe he never truly stayed.

I couldn’t even argue. I was too tired to. Too empty.

But then the memories came rushing in—how it all started. Six years ago. Back when Alynna had left the country for school and left Clinton devastated. I had been there, a silent shadow, a friend, someone who offered him comfort when he was drinking and miserable. And in a single, foolish night… everything changed.

He proposed months later, saying he wanted something real. I believed him.

And then Alynna came back. And suddenly I wasn’t enough anymore.

Their affair started slowly—subtle glances, inside jokes. And then it wasn’t hidden at all. She told me herself, over wine one afternoon: “He was mine first. He’ll always be mine. You were just a substitute until I came back.”

I should’ve left then. But I stayed. For the baby. For a love that clearly didn’t exist.

“You’ve caused enough trouble,” my father’s voice boomed from the patio. “After everything, now you’re fighting with Alynna too? Haven’t you done enough?”

His words hit me like another slap. “You’re grounded. Go to your room and stay there. Don’t come out until you’ve learned your place.”

And so I was locked inside.

The hours passed slowly, the silence louder than ever. Laughter echoed from downstairs—the three of them living, celebrating, pretending I never existed.

I cried myself to sleep that night.

A day later, the door creaked open. Alynna stepped in, holding a tray of food. Her smile was cold and victorious.

“Eat up, sister. You must be starving. It’s been a day. You know your place now, right?”

I glared at her. “I don’t want anything from you.”

She tilted her head. “Suit yourself. But Clinton did say you looked pale. Wouldn’t want to worry anyone.”

I hesitated, my stomach churning. But hunger won over suspicion.

Minutes after I took a bite, I started to sweat. My throat closed. My skin began to itch. Then I knew.

Seafood. I was allergic.

I stumbled to the bathroom, clutching the wall, calling for help. No one answered.

I faintly heard Clinton’s voice from the hall. “What’s going on?”

“She didn’t like the food,” Alynna replied calmly. “She was screaming for no reason.”

“What? An ungrateful woman! You already cook for her and she’d say that? Let’s just leave her and have fun outside.”

The last thing I heard was their voices laughing before everything went black.

Chapter 3

I woke up to the sterile white of the hospital ceiling again. The smell of antiseptic was too familiar by now, as if even my lungs had learned to live with it.

A nurse leaned over, gently checking my vitals. “You’re awake,” she said softly, then sighed. “Chloe… this is the third time this month. I really think you should call someone. A family member. A friend? Or should we report this to the police?”

I gave her a faint smile, though it didn’t reach my eyes. “There’s no one left to call. And I’m okay, I’ll handle this myself.”

She hesitated, clearly unsure of how to respond. Then she nodded and quietly excused herself.

As soon as the door clicked shut, I turned to my phone resting on the side table. Notifications flashed across the screen. One, in particular, made my breath catch.

It was a message from Alynna.

There was a photo. A fresh one—Alynna curled up in Clinton’s arms, the two of them smiling like the world hadn’t just shattered around me. Like I hadn't just buried our baby. Like I didn't exist.

A second later, a video followed. I hesitated—my finger hovering—then tapped play.

It was them. In our room. My room.

Alynna giggling as Clinton pulled her close. His hands around her body. Her lips pressing to his as he lifted her onto the bed. And then—her calling his name like I never existed.

My throat tightened. My chest felt hollow.

Another message lit up my screen.

“Oops, I don’t think you were supposed to see that. But since you did—sorry. Clinton can’t come today. He’s… busy. With me. Don’t worry. You won’t die from a little food mishap, right?”

I stared at it for a long time. But I didn’t cry.

Not anymore.

Instead, I deleted the message and placed my phone face down. My heart felt strangely light—like it had been emptied out long ago, and now there was nothing left to break.

Moments later, the phone buzzed again. This time, it was from Nathan.

“Everything’s ready. Just give me the signal and I’ll pick you up. No more delays, Chloe.”

A lump formed in my throat.

“I’ll be there,” I typed back.

“You better be,” he replied. “I’m not going to let you waste your life with that man anymore.”

Nathan. The one I once rejected because I thought loyalty to Clinton mattered more than love. The one who waited anyway. The one who offered me an out.

It was time to take it.

Later that day, I was discharged. No one came to pick me up—not that I expected anyone to.

When I returned home, I headed straight to my room, only to find more of Alynna’s things in place of mine. Makeup scattered on my vanity. Her heels in my closet. Like I was already erased from the life I supposedly owned.

But I wasn’t staying long. I just had one final thing to do.

The divorce papers were inside my bag, freshly printed and ready. The only missing part was Clinton’s signature.

And as if the universe heard me, there he was at the dining table, buried under a stack of documents. He didn’t even look up.

“Bring me some coffee,” he muttered. “And sort through these. Just flip them when I’m done.”

I approached slowly, heart pounding, and slipped the divorce papers into the stack. When he reached for the pen, I flipped the page without blinking.

He signed. Just like that.

“Anything else?” he asked flatly.

“No,” I said quietly. “I’m not feeling well. I’ll rest after I cook.”

“Good,” he grunted. “Alynna’s craving something spicy. Don’t mess it up.”

I nodded and walked to the kitchen.

No more arguments. No more shouting. Just this one last performance before the curtain dropped on this life.

I chopped the vegetables in silence. The knife hitting the board was the only rhythm left in my heart.

Alynna walked in moments later. She leaned against the counter like she owned the entire house. “You’re still here?” she said, her voice sharp and smug.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t need to.

“I mean, why?” she pressed on. “Shouldn’t you be gone by now? Honestly, I thought I got rid of you already. You’re like gum on a shoe.”

I kept chopping, refusing to give her the satisfaction of a response.

Then she leaned closer and whispered, “Why are you still alive?”

That made me stop.

“I will be gone soon,” I said evenly. “You don’t have to worry about me anymore.”

A slow, wicked smile spread across her face. “Good. Be gone before I give him his heir. I don’t want you clinging to our lives like a ghost.”

She turned and walked out, heels clicking against the tile.

But what she didn’t know—what none of them knew—was that I was already gone.

All that remained now was my shadow.

Chapter 4

I was folding the last of my clothes into the suitcase when the door slammed open.

“What do you think you’re doing?” my father barked from the doorway.

I looked up slowly, calmly. “I’m going on a short trip. Just a few days by myself.”

His eyes narrowed, like he was waiting for me to flinch. “Did I say you could go anywhere? Have you forgotten you’re supposed to prepare for my birthday tomorrow?”

“I already did,” I said, quietly. “The venue is booked. The catering confirmed. I made sure everything was taken care of.”

“Oh, really?” he sneered. “Then why did the venue call just now threatening to cancel because someone failed to confirm the guest list?”

My lips parted, confused. I was certain everything was handled. But before I could speak, he cut me off.

“Useless,” he muttered. “Just like always.”

I stiffened.

Behind him, Alynna appeared with that sweet, soft voice of hers.

“Dad, please don’t get mad at her. She probably just forgot. It happens.” She turned to me with a smile. “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. You’ve done enough already.”

I looked at her. And in that moment, I knew.

She had sabotaged it. Again.

It had always been like this.

I remembered being ten when Alynna shattered one of our mother’s favorite porcelain vases. She looked me dead in the eyes, lip trembling, and cried, “Chloe pushed me!” Even as I stood there, frozen, hands tucked behind my back, our father stormed in and didn’t even ask. He grabbed me by the arm, yelling about how I was reckless, ungrateful—that I didn’t deserve anything in the house I broke.

A few years later, it was the entrance exam forms. I’d spent the night carefully filling them out for both of us. The next morning, hers were torn, mine untouched. She cried again—“Chloe must’ve switched them! She probably wanted to be the only one to pass!”

And again, he believed her.

He always did. Every broken thing. Every mistake. Every missed appointment or misunderstood chore—it was Chloe’s fault. Alynna was the golden one, even when she was cruel. She had the smiles, the charm, the lies dressed in silk. I was the stain on the family name.

And every time I tried to speak? I was silenced. Dismissed. So I stopped speaking. What was the point?

They left me in my room, like they always did, with nothing but my thoughts and my bag.

Just one more day, I reminded myself. Just tomorrow… and I’ll be gone.

The next morning was filled with noise. Decorations. Staff. Laughter.

Of course, Alynna was the star of the show. Everyone praised her for “fixing” the problem with the venue. No one even looked my way. My father, dressed in his finest, gave me a glance of disdain.

“For your punishment,” he said loudly, “you’ll be serving drinks tonight. Stay away from our table. I don’t want you embarrassing me.”

Then Clinton chimed in, already buttoning his cufflinks. “And give your necklace to Alynna. It matches her dress better.”

My fingers instinctively clutched the pendant at my throat—delicate, gold-plated, and worn from years of holding it close. My mother’s. The last thing she ever gave me before she died. My breath caught.

“No,” I said quietly, then louder, firmer. “No. This necklace is mine. It was my mother’s. It’s the only thing I have left of her.”

Alynna stepped forward, already in full performance mode. “It’s okay, Chloe,” she said in that sweet voice that always made people fall for her lies. “I didn’t know it was that important to you. I just thought… maybe I could wear it just for tonight. It would mean a lot—”

“It means everything to me,” I cut in. “You already took everything else.”

Clinton’s jaw tightened. “Don’t be dramatic.”

“I’m not being dramatic, I’m asking you to respect this. Just this one thing.”

Clinton strode over to me in two quick steps. “Fine. If you won’t hand it over…” He reached out, his hand curling around the chain. “Then I’ll take it.”

“Clinton, don’t—!”

He yanked.

The clasp snapped against the back of my neck, a sharp sting biting into my skin. I flinched, but I didn’t cry out. Not this time.

He tossed it to Alynna like it meant nothing.

“It looks better on her anyway,” he said flatly.

They all walked out without me. I was truly done.

Later that evening, when the last car rolled down the driveway and the estate went quiet, I stood up from the bench outside the gate and walked to the back garage. My suitcase was already packed. The limousine I’d arranged with Nathan was waiting.

I handed my old house key to the mailman at the gate, along with a sealed envelope.

Inside it: the divorce papers, the wedding ring, and a thick folder of evidence—proof of every lie Alynna had told, every mistake she blamed on me, and every time I took the fall.

As I slid into the back seat of the limousine, my phone buzzed.

It was Clinton.

“Where the heck are you? The party started. My grandfather’s asking where you are. Don’t you dare ruin this for me. Get here now and be a good wife.”

I stared at the screen for a second. Then, with a steady hand, I typed:

“I’m no longer your wife. So enjoy the party. I already sent you my goodbye gift, my dear ex-husband.”

I hit send. Turned my phone off. And watched as the gates closed behind me.

I am the shadow that walks the hallways while you sleep.
Silent as regret, carved in secrets I keep.
I step through the doors, begin the walk—
No need for words, no time for talk.

Fluorescent flicker, vending hum,
The day is gone, the night has come.
I trade the noise for muted tone,
Where whispers echo, and I roam alone.

I know the rhythm of your midnight breath,
The twitch of your feet, the scent of death.
Not here to judge, nor here to save,
Just marking time between cradle and grave.

A call light blinks like a ticking bomb,
The halls stay quiet, but never calm.
I pass the rooms where secrets lie,
Where some hang on, and some say goodbye.

The Code came fast, with fists and fear—
I stepped in close, and drew in near.
No thanks required, no glory sought,
I do the work that must be wrought.

I walk the grounds beneath the moon,
Where shadows stretch and endings loom.
Out by the dock, the silence sings,
And something waits with ragged wings.

The coffee’s cold, the air sits still,
This kind of peace can feel like chill.
The world outside keeps dreaming on,
While I hold watch until it’s gone.

The sun returns with quiet grace,
Light crawls across this worn-out place.
I fade like mist, unseen, unnamed—
Standing proud, I have no shame.

I am the shadow that walks the hallways while you sleep.
I carry the silence, through a promise buried deep.",1,1752034834.0,Poems,0,1.0,False
