1nhq3ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/1nhq3ll/renting_in_camp_taylor_vs_buying_in_the_highlands/,Renting in Camp Taylor vs Buying in the Highlands ‚Äî need some advice,"Hey y‚Äôall,

Looking for some housing advice in Louisville. Right now my partner and I are renting a renovated 2-story garage from a relative in the **Camp Taylor** neighborhood. Honestly, I love it ‚Äî quiet off the main road, good size, plenty of parking, and it‚Äôs basically a brand new build. Rent is stable, I‚Äôve got some control to improve the space, and the neighbors in the main house (2 units) are great.

That said, we've got an opportunity to **buy a place in the Highlands** and I‚Äôm torn.

It‚Äôs a 2 bed / 2 full bath apartment in a gorgeous Victorian that‚Äôs been split into 3 units. We‚Äôd be on the top floor, similar size to what I‚Äôve got now, with good parking and storage. HOA is $320/mo plus an annual $800 fee (covers shared property maintenance, yard, etc.). Listed at $325k (will likely offer lower), and we could probably put down about 18% at listed price.

Currently, I‚Äôm paying $1,800/mo rent (water included, electric separate).

The main benefit of moving would be **location**. I‚Äôm car-free (bike, bus, scooter/motorcycle) and dream of living within walking distance of friends, coffee shops, and bars in the Highlands. Right now we can walk to Kroger and Creason Park, but not much else. I can bike to work and most places fine, but my girlfriend isn‚Äôt comfortable biking longer distances, so she mostly relies on the scooter. Walkability is super important to me.

So I‚Äôm weighing:

* **Stay in Camp Taylor:** stable rent, quiet, space I like, family connection, less walkable.
* **Move to the Highlands:** walkability, social life, dream location, but higher cost + HOA fees.

Would love to hear your pros/cons ‚Äî financially and lifestyle-wise. Is buying into this situation a decent long-term decision (equity, resale, etc.) or would I be smarter sticking with my current setup?",1,1757952562.0,Louisville,1,1.0,False

1nhpynp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nhpynp/evaluate_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_technivorm/,Evaluate the best drip coffee maker Technivorm Moccamaster worth it,"Perfect Coffee Brewing with the Technivorm Moccamaster 53923

Coffee enthusiasts like me are always on the hunt for a machine that delivers that perfect sip. With the Technivorm Moccamaster 53923, I decided to take the dive and test if the buzz around this 10-cup coffee maker lives up to its reputation. Over the past month, this sleek and modern coffee maker has taken center stage on my kitchen counter, and spoiler alert: it's been a coffee-filled journey worth sharing.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**

One of the first things that struck me about this coffee maker was its luxurious finish. The juniper color adds a contemporary flair to my kitchen setup, blending seamlessly with the rest of my appliances. The dimensions, 6.5"" x 12.75"" x 14"", make it an ideal size‚Äîit‚Äôs large enough to brew a solid 10 cups but compact enough not to dominate your counter space. Additionally, the glass carafe and sturdy materials feel premium. You can tell this is a machine built with durability in mind, designed to provide years of service. 

**Ease of Use with Smart Features**

Turning this coffee machine on for the first time was surprisingly straightforward. The ‚Äúfully automatic‚Äù operation mode and one-button control interface make it practically foolproof. I‚Äôm not a morning person, so having a coffee maker that requires minimal effort is a game changer. The selector switch provides brewing flexibility, allowing you to choose between a full or half carafe. Whether I‚Äôm hosting a group or just need a personal pick-me-up, the machine adjusts brewing speed and the hotplate's temperature to deliver consistently optimal results.

**Want to see Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 deals on Amazon now? [Click here.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0bpjqs63w/)**

**Performance That Sets It Apart**

This drip coffee machine excels in performance. It heats water to the ideal temperature for coffee extraction, and within 4-6 minutes, my full 40-ounce carafe is ready. The pump-free brewing method ensures smooth operation while preserving the coffee's rich flavors. Each time I brewed, the results were a balanced and aromatic cup of coffee that rivaled what you‚Äôd expect from a high-end caf√©. Plus, the hotplate‚Äôs independent heating element kept my coffee at the perfect temperature without burning it‚Äîa crucial win, especially for slow sippers like myself!

**Good Points**

- Pump-free design for consistent water temperature  
- Quick brewing time (4-6 minutes for a full carafe)  
- Adjustable brew-volume selector for flexibility  
- Keeps coffee hot without burning it  
- Operates quietly, perfect for early mornings  

**Quiet and Safe to Use**

Noise is often a dealbreaker for coffee machines, but this one operates so quietly it‚Äôs barely noticeable. Early mornings are peaceful and don't feel like a clanging machine is disrupting the tranquility. Safety-wise, the auto-shutoff feature after 100 minutes is a reassuring touch. The last thing I want is to accidentally leave an appliance running when I head out for work.

**Considerations**

No product is flawless, and this one does have a few quirks. On one occasion, I noticed the coffee was brewing slower than usual, which seemed tied to how I positioned the filter. It isn‚Äôt a huge issue, but there‚Äôs a small learning curve when you first start using it. Additionally, while the machine uses paper filters, it means adding a recurring purchase to your budget‚Äîa consideration for those hesitant about disposable accessories.

**Critiques**

- A slight learning curve when setting up the filter  
- Requires paper filters, leading to additional costs  
- Premium price point compared to some other coffee makers  

**Direct Competitors**

Compared to its market rivals like the Breville Precision Brewer or the Braun MultiServe Coffee Maker, the Technivorm Moccamaster stands out with its robust performance. While the Breville model offers customizable brewing settings, it doesn‚Äôt heat water as consistently to the optimal extraction temperature as this Moccamaster does. Braun MultiServe impresses with its large capacity and sleek design, but it can‚Äôt quite replicate the seamless simplicity and caf√©-quality brew provided here. The hotplate temperature control and auto shut-off feature also give the Moccamaster a clear edge regarding user-focused convenience and safety.

**Worth Every Penny**

Investing in a high-quality coffee maker often invites doubts about whether it‚Äôs justified. For me, the Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select delivers enough superior features to justify its price. Unlike cheaper models, which often compromise on coffee flavor and durability, this model has proven to be a reliable companion for my daily caffeine ritual. With quality materials, a 5-year warranty, and consistent performance, it truly feels like a long-term investment in sipping satisfaction.

1nhpx5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1nhpx5l/explore_the_best_singleserve_espresso_machine/,Explore the Best Single-Serve Espresso Machine Breville Offers,"Compact, stylish, and genuinely a joy to use, the Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 grabbed my attention with its sleek design and promise of high-quality espresso. Having tested it daily for a few weeks, I spent mornings experimenting with its features and perfecting my coffee ritual. This tiny machine truly surprised me with its performance, particularly for such a small footprint, but there's plenty to unpack about my experience. From the streamlined aesthetics to its functionality, I took the time to explore everything it has to offer, both good and, well, not so good.

**Minimalist Design that Packs a Punch**  
I‚Äôll admit, the compact size of this espresso machine was the first thing that drew me in. At only 3.3 inches in depth and 8 inches wide, it fits seamlessly on my cramped kitchen counter. The piano black matte finish is elegant without being flashy, blending in with the rest of my appliances. Plus, this thing is so lightweight (just under 6 pounds) that I found it easy to move around when rearranging my kitchen. Breville really nailed the minimalist vibe here without making the unit look or feel cheap, which I seriously appreciated.

**Intuitive Operation for Coffee Lovers**  
Breville made operating this machine almost ridiculously easy. The buttons are straightforward, providing two programmable cup sizes‚Äîespresso and lungo. I programmed my preferred lungo size after testing it a few times, and it remembered it without a single glitch. The single-serve brewing system worked like a charm, delivering consistent espresso shots every single time. I noticed that for the best results, you need to use capsules with precision to avoid clogs or weak brews, though that‚Äôs true for most capsule machines.

**Check [Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1] price on Amazon.**

**Remarkable Performance but Some Learning Curve**  
What stood out most was the high-pressure pump and lightning-fast heat-up time. It takes less than 30 seconds for the machine to heat up, meaning I could go from half-asleep to caffeinated bliss without much delay. The pressure ensures a creamy, rich espresso shot and, when paired with the milk frother, I managed to create caf√©-quality cappuccinos that even impressed my coffee-snob brother.

However, grind size and tamping are critical factors here. One morning, I accidentally used a coarser grind, and the results were far from the consistently smooth espresso shots I‚Äôd gotten before. Adjustments are crucial to avoid underwhelming brews, which made me feel like I needed to be more cautious than initially expected.

**The Pros of This Tiny Powerhouse**  
There‚Äôs plenty to love about this machine, and below are some of its strongest attributes:  
- Compact and lightweight design fits effortlessly in small kitchens.  
- High-pressure pump delivers barista-quality espresso.  
- Rapid heat-up system is perfect for busy mornings.  
- Auto energy-saving function cuts power after nine minutes of inactivity.  

**Flaws Worth Mentioning**  
While this machine ticks many boxes, it‚Äôs not immune to a few shortcomings:  
- Limited to capsule use, which can feel restrictive for coffee enthusiasts who prefer freshly ground beans.  
- Grind size variance requires adjustments that aren‚Äôt intuitive for first-time users.  
- The included milk frother lacks advanced settings for precise froth densities.  

**Considering Other Options on the Market**  
While the Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 is an admirable single-serve espresso machine, alternatives exist with a wider appeal depending on what you're after. For instance, the Keurig K-Cafe offers a broader range of beverage types and works with standard coffee pods, providing greater flexibility for households with diverse tastes. Despite this, its espresso quality trails far behind Breville‚Äôs offering. Alternatively, the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica provides similar caf√©-quality shots with more customization options, though it‚Äôs bulkier and demands a steeper learning curve. Where this model truly excels is its form factor and simplicity, which many competitors fail to balance as effectively.

**Cost Efficiency That Delivers**  
When it comes to value, this machine holds up exceptionally well. While the upfront cost might make you think twice, the quality of the espresso and lungo servings makes it feel worth the investment. It gave me a true coffee shop experience without having to leave home, and each shot felt thoughtfully extracted. While other machines offer similar features at a comparable price point, the user-friendly buttons and energy-saving features give this model a slight edge for first-time buyers or minimalists who want great coffee without complication.

\### Training

Background, Legacy of Hope is a non-profit based in Philadelphia that raises money to help people who have cancer afford basic needs like food, bills, shelter, etc.  I won't go into great depth here but you can use the above link to find out more about the organization.  This is the 8th year of their PHL 24 challenge/race which is 24 hours up and down the Philadelphia Art Museum steps (a la Rocky I).  It's approximately 0.21 miles from curb to the museum and back, and you do this for 24 hours.  This year, there were 30 contestants/fundraisers who took part in it.

Last year I hit just over 50 miles in the 24 hours and was attempting to hit 60 this year so instead of focusing on running I have been doing a lot more stair steps and leg strengthening at the gym, focusing primarily on not allowing my legs to get as tired as they did last year.  I know my feet and ankles would be swollen, given that this race is on concrete, but what I wanted to avoid was overexertion on my thighs and calves from the up and down steps.  I still continued with my running but dropped to about 30-35 mpw and dropped doing any speed work to help with recovery.

\### Pre-race

Got to the steps at about 7:15 am to set up my station and say hi to the other people doing the race from the last event.  Mostly just a lot of sitting around before we started the opening ceremonies.  The weather was noticeably hotter and more humid than last year, but it was cooler in the morning so far.

Right before the race there are opening remarks from the charity and event organizers.  Both the founder and CCO speak and walk during this event, so it's much more of a community and friendly competition.

\### Race

The race starts at 9 am, and the contestants do one lap walking all together before we go at our own pace.  I started the first 3 hours at about a 12-15 min pace and was ahead of my distance last year when it hit 1 pm by a few miles so i was feeling pretty ok despite the heat.  I took breaks every 2 hours of so for about 10-15 min to allow my feet to rest and untied my shoes.  Water/electrolytes were consumed as well as other bites of food before going back out again.  There's no shade during the first 9 hours of the event, so I dialed back to walking under the heat.  I continued with this strategy until the sun was behind the museum and the course cooled off slightly.

This year one difference is I had my sister as another contestant because after a while, and with a lot of other runners doing this even at different paces with different goals you run into large swaths of time when you're by yourself.  Under a normal point to point race this isn't bad but when you have the same visuals for 24 hours you need to have someone there to talk to and break up the monotony.  This was also her first ultra or endurance event which was good for her to do it with someone rather than alone.

From 6 pm until about 12 am, I was feeling OK but I could tell my body was more drained than last years event.  With this my watch was running low on charge so I decided to charge it up and take a nap.  In doing so I wound up sleeping for an extra 30 min total and woke up very groggy and unable to get back into the pace I was at previously and felt noticeably slower.  I decided at around 2 am (I think) to take another nap but wound up sleeping for too long and woke up around 3:30 am-ish.  I felt much better now but was well far behind my goal distances.  Feet and ankles were very sore at this point and running seemed to be out of the question.  So I continued to walk, taking about 15-20 min breaks every hour or so.

Once the sun came up at 6:30 am, I perked up immensely and was able to get some coffee in my at around 7 am.  Once the caffeine boost hit at 8 am I ran the last hour and logged an extra 3+ miles which I thought brought me to 50 but I had mistakenly hit the lap button on my garmin at one point and was about 1.4 miles short of my goal distance.  I think I had enough juice to hit 50 but the time wasn't on my side, unfortunately.

\### Post-race

We ended the event at 9 am and did the closing ceremonies.  Celebrating the fundraising goal with champagne.  From there, I went home and ate what must have been close to 6,000 calories worth of food in between naps.  I woke up this morning feeling surprisingly OK for the distance and less tired than last year.  All in all, a fund event for a great cause and a really great challenge for anyone who does some sort of ultra running.

The Lavazza Classy Plus might sound like just another coffee maker if you glance at its name, but this thing isn‚Äôt messing around. With its all-in-one design and the promise of whipping up espresso, coffee, and milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos, it positioned itself as more than just an everyday brew tool. The device brings barista-style craftsmanship right onto your counter, but let's unpack everything‚Äîthe hits, the quirks, and the occasional raised eyebrows I had while testing it daily.

**Innovative and Compact Design**  
One of the first things that got my attention was the elegant compactness of this coffee machine. Measuring 7.87 x 18.9 x 13.78 inches, this sleek brewer slid neatly into the corner of my kitchen without hogging counter space. At just under ten pounds, moving it for a cleaning session or rearrangement was painless. Its design reminded me of high-end European coffee bars, combining aesthetics with performance. However, the glossy plastic exterior was a dust magnet. A quick wipe every other day was necessary, which felt slightly annoying, but the stylish appearance made up for it.  

**Performance and Versatility**  
The Lavazza Classy Plus absolutely shines in versatility. Whether you want an espresso shot to kickstart the morning or a creamy cappuccino in the afternoon, this machine offers it all. With settings for espresso, lungo, double-shot, 8 oz coffee, macchiatos, lattes, and cappuccinos, it truly had me spoiled for choice. While testing it, I marveled at how effortlessly it brewed an espresso with rich crema, then pivoted to frothing milk for a latte without missing a beat. It‚Äôs clear this coffee machine was designed with the cappuccino and latte-loving crowd in mind. The built-in milk frother was such a time-saver. That said, the milk container‚Äôs limited size required refilling more often than I expected during back-to-back coffee-making sessions.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Produces a wide range of drinks, perfect for households or offices with varying preferences.  
- Built-in milk frother simplifies preparing cafe-style beverages.  
- Adjustable brewing heights make it compatible with different mug sizes.

**Compatibility and Capsule Options**  
I genuinely appreciated the machine's compatibility with Lavazza Expert and Blue Capsules. As someone who values variety in coffee flavors and blends, this feature broadened the horizons of my coffee drinking experience. Swapping capsules to test different brews was fun, but it does limit you to the Lavazza ecosystem unless some creative hacks are applied (not recommended by Lavazza, of course). This isn‚Äôt necessarily a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs something worth considering for those who might hold a loyalty card to other brands‚Äô capsules.

**Downsides**  
- Limited to Lavazza Expert and Blue Capsules, which constrains flexibility.  
- Milk container runs small, especially for gatherings or frequent refills.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
There‚Äôs simplicity here that usually comes after years of perfecting user experience design. This machine was intuitive and beginner-friendly, with a no-nonsense interface that allowed me to choose different settings without cracking the manual. Cleaning it wasn‚Äôt time-consuming; most parts detach easily, and the milk frother cleaned up without drama. The only hiccup came with descaling. It‚Äôs necessary to do periodically, but the process felt more involved than I‚Äôd like‚Äîa minor gripe for an otherwise efficient appliance.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this brewer side-by-side with competitors like the Nespresso Lattissima Plus or Keurig K-Cafe was illuminating. The Lavazza model stood out for its focus on Italian-inspired authenticity, delivering espresso shots that tasted notably closer to what you‚Äôd get in an espresso bar. Though the Nespresso had greater capsule variety, the Lavazza Classy Plus outperformed it in milk frothing consistency. Keurig‚Äôs offerings allowed for more coffee variety, but I missed the silky espresso crema and richness that the Lavazza nailed so well. If coffee is therapeutic for you, as it is for me, the Lavazza satisfies those soul-soothing cravings better than most alternatives.

**Price Performance**  
This machine comfortably aligns with its price range while delivering a quality experience. I wouldn‚Äôt call it strictly ""budget-friendly"" given that capsule costs add up over time. However, for a coffee maker boasting both an integrated milk frother and versatile brewing options, it offers a compelling bang for the buck. It‚Äôs a solid investment for caffeine lovers who appreciate convenience and a touch of luxury. Its cost-effectiveness grows if you compare it to visiting a coffee shop every morning‚Äîyou‚Äôll recoup the price in no time if that‚Äôs your routine.

1nhps9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/1nhps9d/my_family_is_letting_me_down_im_the_caregiver_and/,"My family is letting me down (I'm the caregiver, and now my family doesn't take care of me.)","I just need some sympathy. And if you have any advice or stories about how you managed a similar situation, I would love to hear them. 

tl;dr: I've been the emotional caretaker of my three-person family for decades. (Neither of them is disabled -- I just fill this role.) Now I need emotional and physical caretaking, but they haven't stepped up.

I was diagnosed last year. I am 57, and my wife and I have been together for 38 years. We have a daughter who is 25 and lives in Europe. (We live in the U.S.) My flares are getting worse, but I feel better between them, because I take LDN.

I'm also caring for my mother, who has dementia but is able to live independently. She lives 5.5 hours away by car, and I visit her once a month for five or so days, usually breaking the trip up, so that I'm not driving that far at one time. Being with her in this way is really important to me, and I work hard to maintain a balance between my pain and energy, so that I can visit. 

My daughter is in the states at the moment. She was in a wedding over the weekend, but she's here for a week, so that we can visit. I made elaborate arrangements so that she could see my mom -- her grandmother -- for a few days. This involved *much* more driving than usual. One reason I made this particular plan is so that I could spend some time with my daughter in the car. Unfortunately, she drank too much at the wedding the night before, and she slept the entire way home. 

That's super disappointing. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have done it this way, but my main reason for posting is because of today. 

We got home yesterday (Sunday) afternoon at 4 p.m. On Friday, we had gotten a notice that our electricity would be out from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m. for maintenance. I was really concerned about this, because there was a high probability that I'd be in a lot of pain, very foggy, and with almost no energy. And that has happened. I can't even walk well, and my arms feel like 50 pound weights. 

My plan was to work at one of my wife's properties. (I know, I'm incredibly lucky.)  She didn't tell me that she would have workers there today. This means that I have virtually no place to go. I finally made it to a coffee shop, where I'm sitting in a metal chair with so much noise around me.   
  
On the way here and called my wife in tears. I told her that last night, she and our daughter blew off my concerns about being without electricity; she got defensive. She said that I could go to the building with the workers, but honestly, when I'm sick, I don't want to be around people who will need something of me. (I know that sounds silly, since I'm at a coffee shop, but this small difference matters to me.)   
  
My frustration is that I have to set up *everything* in order to avoid these situations, including knowing that my plan B isn't available. My wife and daughter left the house a total mess this morning, and I don't have my coping mechanisms -- nothing low-stakes like television or my computer. I have 3.5 more hours before the electricity is back on. 

Am I crazy to expect my wife of 38 years to think ahead on these things. She knows that after trips like these, it's very likely I'll have a huge flair. She was here all weekend and could have managed some contingencies. She could have remembered that I have terrible brain fog when I'm in a flare (and she knew I was in a flare before I left) and plugged my laptop in last night. These are things I would have done for her, without her even asking. (She has PTSD, and I've been anticipating her needs for that for three decades.)

I have been pulling myself out of the emotional caretaking role for years, and I feel pretty good about where I am with those things. And I know we don't all have the ability to anticipate the needs of others, but shouldn't my partner of 38 years at least notice that the electricity being out for five hours after a trip like that would be a huge problem. Shouldn't she at least ask what I need? Should I be expected to set up these plans even with brain fog? 

Sorry for the tremendously long post. In some ways, I just need to blow off steam. Fibro is so hard on the whole family, but it's super hard if family members refuse to face the ways in which they make it harder.",2,1757951878.0,Fibromyalgia,0,0.75,False
1nhpryh,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1nhpryh/weigh_your_electrolytes/,Weigh your electrolytes?,"TL;DR: Actually weigh your salt. Don‚Äôt rely on teaspoon measures‚Äîyou might be getting way less than you think.

I started my third extended fast last night (one week long, same as my first two). Both of my previous fasts gave me great results and even fixed some health problems, but they felt rough. I was dizzy and faint most of the time, with severe head rushes every time I stood up.

Today I went to make my usual electrolyte mix (KCl + table salt in water). Previously, I followed the wiki guidelines here, which list both the recommended grams of electrolytes per day and an approximate teaspoon equivalent. I only ever measured with teaspoons.

But this time I figured‚Äîsince I have a good coffee scale‚Äîwhy not check the actual weight? Turns out each teaspoon of either salt was only about 1g:

1g KCl ‚âà 0.5g potassium

1g NaCl ‚âà 0.4g sodium


So with 2 tsp of each per day, I was only getting ~1g potassium and ~0.8g sodium total. The wiki recommend 3g or more of each per day üòÖ

So the recommendations themselves are fine, but the teaspoon conversion was way off for me. That might explain why I felt so awful the last two times. I‚Äôll report back in a couple of days.",0,1757951859.0,fasting,5,0.5,False
1nhpr68,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1nhpr68/whats_wrong_with_my_listing/,"""What's wrong with my listing?""","
That was the question that a colleague of mine asked last year‚Ä¶

I will do two things: 

#1. Share SOME insights of how her listing improved

#2. I want to also ask what you did that has worked? 

What marketing/ promotional stuff have you done with your listing that has actually worked?
I‚Äôm genuinely curious.

And NO!

 I‚Äôm not talking about those hosts or Property Managers who have 35+ properties and have tens of thousands of $$ to outspend their competition.

Also, please don‚Äôt submit generic ""YouTube tips"" such as:

‚ÄúJust change your photos and blah blah.‚Äù

I want to hear REAL results, with REAL insights.

 Stuff that you can say for sure worked.


I will go first:

She owns a boutique villa in Florida.
Her struggles:

- Lots of views but low inquiries.


- Decent traffic to her direct booking website but painfully low direct bookings.


Step 1: Competitor Review Breakdown 

I analyzed the top 30 listings in her market, breaking reviews into:

- Positives,


- Negatives,


- Reasonable requests.



Patterns emerged fast:

- Sand from beach trips = cleaning frustration.


- Host responsiveness = a booking dealbreaker.


- Guests wanted more ‚Äúthings to do‚Äù nearby.



Step 2: Market Data Check

I pulled ADR, RevPAR, booking lead times, average stay length, guest counts, etc.
 She was slightly below average across the board.

Throughout our conversations she kept on asking:

 ‚ÄúCan you optimize my listing to rank higher?‚Äù

 My response: Optimization is not the starting point. 

Positioning is.

Step 3: Positioning the same listing Around 3 Guest Avatars
This market had 3 demand groups:

- Families (4‚Äì6 people, longer stays).


- Couples (short romantic weekends).


- Remote workers / nomads (week+ stays).


So instead of one vague ‚Äúsomething for everyone‚Äù listing, i built 3 clear offers inside the same villa.

Family Offer
Spacious villa, kid-friendly setup, sand-proof mats, washer/dryer, board games, and a ‚Äúlocal fun kit‚Äù (discount passes + family welcome basket).

Couples Offer
Romantic escape: balcony coffees, sunset walks, private chef dinners, wine + cheese packages.

Nomad Offer
Dedicated workspace, fast WiFi, blackout curtains, extra monitor on request, and week-long discounts.

Step 4: Communication System
I built 4 templated inquiry responses (family, couple, nomad, general).
 Each one matched the avatar.
 Some included hooks like: ‚ÄúFree airport transfer if you confirm within 24 hrs.‚Äù

We also invited guests to a 10‚Äì15 min pre-check-in Zoom call where we:

- Built trust face-to-face.


- Walked them through expectations.


- Upsold packages tailored to their avatar.


That alone added $450‚Äì$600 in extra profit per booking (via Airbnb‚Äôs ‚ÄúRequest Funds‚Äù feature).

*Yes, Airbnb has this feature‚Ä¶ And it doesn't attract any service fees‚Ä¶ so its 100% profit.

And because the villa averaged 5‚Äì6 bookings per month, that translated into $1,500‚Äì$2,500 in additional monthly profit‚Ä¶or roughly $25K per year.

*Note: Not all guests took up the offers‚Ä¶ the best month was 63% conversion, and the lowest month was just about 28%.

Step 5: Extra Services That Guests Loved
We layered in two unique services: (example for one guest avatar below)

Maid-on-Call
 Available all day for touch-up cleans, laundry help, or resets. Maids loved it because they got tipped, guests loved it because it felt like hotel service.


Pre-Checkout Helper
 Maid helped with packing, cleaning rental car, ironing, laundry, organizing kids‚Äô stuff‚Ä¶so checkout wasn‚Äôt stressful. Guests ended relaxed instead of frazzled.


One family review literally said:
‚ÄúI did expect that type of checkout. We‚Äôll definitely be back.‚Äù

The Results
Before: 2‚Äì3 bookings/month, avg. stay length 4 nights.


After: 5‚Äì6 bookings/month, avg. stay length 5 nights.


ADR climbed ~15%.


Add-ons brought an extra $25K in profit for the year.


Picture this..
Think of positioning like cars: a Toyota RAV4 can be positioned as:

- a family vehicle


- a status SUV


- or a budget-friendly reliable off-roader.


It‚Äôs the same vehicle, but positioned differently depending on who‚Äôs buying.

Listings are the same. Not every property can flex across multiple avatars, but when they can. Position first, then optimize.

Your Turn 

What‚Äôs the ONE thing you‚Äôve done that actually moved the needle for your bookings?

Doesn‚Äôt matter how small‚Ä¶share it, because someone here will probably learn from it, try it and thank you later.

Outspoken - had the nachos and they were delicious, home cooked food! Very good cocktails, too. 

Stacked Pancake // & The Breakfast Pig - this opinion is divisive, but I think Stacked Pancake was a better breakfast than The Breakfast Pig! Amazing hollandaise sauce. But if you are needing two breakfasts, these are the two to go to. 

Minerva vintage - best vintage shop I‚Äôve ever seen! 

Crystal Falls - gorgeous waterfalls! Nice hike nearby. Found All Trails app very useful for this one. 

Agawa Rock Pictographs - worth the drive, not for the faint of heart or non-swimmer. I feel like the park system could make this safer for the pictographs and the visitors, though‚Ä¶

This machine really shines in its user-friendliness. With pre-programmed options for espresso, lungo, double shot, latte, cappuccino, and even macchiato, it delivers coffee-shop results with just the touch of a button. I particularly loved the adjustable height function, which is perfect for accommodating various cup sizes. My larger mugs felt right at home under the spout, and switching to smaller espresso cups was hassle-free. 

For someone who likes to mix things up, I appreciated both the Lavazza Blue and Expert capsule compatibility. The range of capsule flavors allowed me to experiment with different coffee profiles without having to commit to just one brand or type. Plus, the double shot feature is a lifesaver on mornings when I need an extra caffeine boost.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
The overall performance of the machine is commendable. It heats up relatively quickly, making mornings a tad less stressful. Once I hit the button, the coffee brewed smoothly and consistently. Espresso shots came out rich with a lovely crema on top. When preparing lattes or cappuccinos, the built-in milk frother emulsified milk beautifully, creating that creamy texture many caf√© beverages boast.

The control buttons are intuitive and light up, making it clear what you‚Äôre pressing. And yes, it‚Äôs as beginner-friendly as it gets ‚Äî my brother, who‚Äôs never touched a coffee machine in his life, managed to whip up a latte without a hitch. However, I‚Äôd recommend cleaning the milk frother nozzle after each use to avoid clogs or residue buildup.

**Benefits**  
- Handles a variety of drinks (espresso, lungo, cappuccino, macchiato, etc.)
- Built-in milk frother delivers a rich, creamy foam  
- Compact and stylish design fits well on smaller counters  
- Compatible with Lavazza Blue and Expert capsules for flexible flavor choices  

**Drawbacks**  
- Some parts feel slightly flimsy due to plastic build  
- Milk frother requires diligent cleaning to maintain performance  
- Capsule dependency might not appeal to those who prefer ground coffee  

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to machines like the Keurig K-Cafe or the Nespresso VertuoPlus, the Lavazza Classy Plus holds its ground impressively. While other machines may offer more capsule options or larger water reservoirs, the milk frother integration on this coffee maker sets it apart. Compared to Nespresso, Lavazza's capsules were slightly more affordable where I shop, which is a win for frequent users. However, the Nespresso's sleek aluminum finishes might draw attention if aesthetics are paramount for you. As for the Keurig, its versatility in brewing tea and regular coffee might appeal to broader households, though it doesn‚Äôt specialize in espressos like this one.

**Price Performance**  
Is it worth the cost? I‚Äôd say yes if you frequently enjoy lattes, cappuccinos, or artisan-level coffee but don‚Äôt want the hassle of managing multiple gadgets. While it‚Äôs not cheap, its range of features and coffee quality make it a good pick over separate espresso machines and milk frothers. To be fair, the capsule-only design could turn budget-conscious folks away due to recurring capsule expenses, but for coffee aficionados, it‚Äôs an investment that pays off handsomely.

1nhpi7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCSpend/comments/1nhpi7j/uncover_if_the_hp_14_ultrabook_laptop_lives_up_to/,Uncover If the HP 14 Ultrabook Laptop Lives Up to the Hype,"Testing the HP Ultrabook has been nothing short of an intriguing experience. This sleek and powerful laptop, equipped with Intel‚Äôs N150 processor and running Windows 11 Home, took a prominent place in my daily work and personal activities. Between its stylish Honey Lavender design and the range of features it offers, it‚Äôs hard not to appreciate its effort to cater to both function and aesthetic appeal. But as with anything technology-related, there are always nuances worth dissecting, both good and bad.

**Design and Portability**  
The moment I unboxed this HP Ultrabook, its Honey Lavender finish struck me. It's not often that you come across a laptop with such a standout color, which adds a refreshing touch to the typical grayscale laptops many gravitate towards. The build is impressively slim, measuring just 0.71 inches thick and weighing 3.24 pounds, making it a no-brainer for anyone constantly on the move. Sliding it into a backpack feels seamless, and pulling it out during meetings or coffee shop trips often gets a compliment or two. The 14-inch micro-edge display does wonders for maximizing screen space while keeping the overall footprint compact. On top of that, the anti-glare HD display ensures readability even under bright lighting conditions.  

**Performance and Multitasking**  
From the get-go, the performance has been solid. Powered by an Intel N150 processor and integrated Intel graphics, this machine is built for everyday computing tasks and light multitasking. I‚Äôve used it for everything, from running multiple spreadsheets in Excel to editing presentations in PowerPoint, and it consistently performs smoothly. With 32GB of DDR4 RAM, the Ultrabook doesn‚Äôt stumble even with numerous tabs and programs running simultaneously. What really impressed me, though, was how zippy the boot times were‚Äîa credit to Windows 11 Home and the SSD storage.  

[Check HP Ultrabook pricing on Amazon.](https://mincopc.com/p/b0f1clp8p4/)  

**Storage and Battery Life**  
Having 1.6TB of storage capacity, courtesy of a combination of 128GB Universal Flash Storage, a portable 512GB HP SSD, and 1TB OneDrive Cloud Storage, has been transformative for me. My files, photos, and videos find their place without me needing constant storage clean-ups. And did I mention the battery life? The promise of 12 hours was fairly accurate in real-world usage. I‚Äôve managed full workdays, with some leftover juice for evening Netflix sessions, all thanks to HP‚Äôs inclusion of fast charging features as well.

**Strong Points**  
‚Ä¢ Extremely lightweight and portable, making it a great travel companion.  
‚Ä¢ Sufficient storage options with multiple formats (on-device, external drive, and cloud).  
‚Ä¢ Impressive RAM capacity for seamless multitasking.  

**Connectivity Options and Audio**  
Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4 have handled all my wireless requirements flawlessly. I particularly appreciated the variety of ports‚ÄîUSB Type-C, USB Type-A, HDMI, and even an SD media card reader, ensuring I rarely had to reach for a dongle. However, the audio experience was a hit-and-miss situation for me. On one hand, the tuned stereo speakers were sufficiently loud for casual video calls and YouTube. But when I tried to immerse myself in music or a movie? It fell slightly flat; the sound had decent clarity but lacked depth. For audiophiles, plugging in a pair of headphones might be the better route.

**Weaknesses**  
‚Ä¢ Screen resolution capped at 1366 x 768, which holds back its visual potential.  
‚Ä¢ Lack of backlit keyboard makes using it in dim lighting inconvenient.  

**Rivals in the Market**  
When stacked against other laptops in the same class, such as the Dell Inspiron 14 or Lenovo IdeaPad Slim, the HP Ultrabook holds its ground in areas of storage flexibility and RAM capacity. However, Lenovo‚Äôs alternatives often feature higher-resolution displays for a comparable price point, while some Dell Inspiron models include backlit keyboards. Still, very few contenders pack the trifecta of portability, storage variety, and sleek design as succinctly as the Ultrabook does.  

**Value Proposition**  
In terms of price to quality ratio, the HP Ultrabook delivers exceptional bang for the buck. It‚Äôs ideal for students, working professionals, or anyone looking for a reliable device with substantial storage and comfortable portability. That being said, its lower screen resolution and lack of backlighting could deter those requiring a more premium display experience or significant usability in low light settings. For what you're getting, it‚Äôs hard to find significant compromises that impact major functionality.

Recently, I went out with a friend for a coffee and an aquintance of her joined us. The three of us had a great afternoon just chilling and chatting. I have to be honest and admit that I thought her aquintance was quite handsome, but, you know, people have eyes and my boyfriend and I can chat in a very fun way about people, both men and women, we find attractive and why, so I didn't think anything of it. We clicked quite well and I found myself thinking ""wow, if I was single I'd definitely like to date this guy"". This thought kind of scared me, as I don't know if it is normal to want that. He also seemed to be interested in me, which didn't help pushing down that thought.

1nhp70p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiritualAwakening/comments/1nhp70p/dream_seduction_when_spirit_visits_in_sleep/,Dream Seduction When Spirit Visits in Sleep,"There are nights when sleep feels ordinary, a dimming of the body, a quieting of the mind. But sometimes, in that space where silence thickens and thought dissolves, something else enters. A presence. A dream so vivid that it does not leave with morning, a dream that clings to the skin like perfume and follows you into waking life.

We call them dreams of seduction ‚Äî not because they are vulgar, but because they seduce the heart, the body, the spirit into paying attention. You wake with your skin humming, your breath uneven, as if something touched you in the night. You did not choose it. You did not summon it. Yet it came, alive with an intimacy too undeniable to dismiss.

At first, the confusion is sharp. You brush your teeth, pour your coffee, try to act as if everything is normal. But inside, the dream stirs like a secret lover whispering your name. Why this dream? Why now? Was it just a trick of the subconscious, a hidden desire breaking free? Or was it something more ‚Äî a visitation, a spirit choosing the only language you could hear while asleep?

Shame sometimes rises here. Because how do you explain to yourself, let alone to anyone else, that you feel marked by a dream? That you wake as though you have crossed some invisible boundary without lifting a finger? The body remembers what never happened. The heart aches with intimacy that cannot be explained.

And yet, perhaps the real reason these dreams unsettle us is not their intensity, but their honesty. They strip away the masks we wear in the daylight. They do not ask permission. They reveal what is already there: the loneliness we bury under busyness, the longing we disguise as independence, the hunger for closeness we pretend not to need.

Cultures across time have spoken of such dreams. Freud would have said they were wish-fulfillment, shadows of repressed desire. Jung, gentler, saw them as symbols ‚Äî figures not of others, but of ourselves. To him, the dream lover was the unacknowledged part of our soul, arriving in disguise to demand recognition.

But outside psychology, traditions of spirit spoke with even more wonder. The Sufis wrote of the Beloved visiting in the night, the Divine cloaked in forms the heart could understand. Indigenous traditions called dreams a bridge to the spirit world, where ancestors and guides crossed into our sleeping hours. Hindu mystics spoke of the subtle body wandering during dreams, touching others across unseen planes. And Christian mystics, too, trembled in their writings with visions of intimacy that blurred the line between human desire and holy union.

Everywhere, the message was the same: these dreams are not accidents. They are thresholds. Invitations. The spirit does not always come in fire or in voice; sometimes it comes clothed in the language of touch, because touch is the one thing we cannot ignore.

So when such a dream comes, the first step is not judgment, but listening. Writing it down in the tender light of morning. Sitting with it in meditation. Asking not, *What is wrong with me?* but, *What is this dream trying to show me?*

Because here is the deeper truth: desire is rarely about what it points to on the surface. Desire is a compass. It shows us where the soul is aching, what part of us is reaching. The dream that leaves you breathless may not be about lust at all. It may be about the ache for belonging. The longing to be held without judgment. The hunger to be known by another, or by the Divine, so fully that no mask remains.

This is why the dreams linger. They refuse dismissal because they are not here to entertain; they are here to awaken. To stir us into awareness of what we have ignored. To remind us that the soul, too, is made of longing ‚Äî and that longing is not shameful, but sacred.

Imagine treating such dreams as scripture rather than scandal. Imagine approaching them with reverence, whispering, *Teach me what you carry.* The dream may reveal grief you have not allowed yourself to feel. Or tenderness you have not allowed yourself to receive. Or the quiet invitation of spirit, calling you to union in a language deeper than words.

Over time, a practice forms. You keep a notebook by your bed. You wake, still trembling, and you write what you remember: the touch, the glance, the feeling that would not fade. You breathe with it in meditation, not trying to solve it, but to let it move through you. And slowly, patterns emerge. You begin to see that the dream is less about seduction and more about recognition. Recognition of your own longing. Recognition of your own spirit reaching for something more.

The shame softens. The confusion loosens. And in its place, curiosity grows.

For some, the dream reveals the desire for human intimacy. For others, it uncovers a hunger for spiritual closeness, for a love that transcends form. For many, it is both at once ‚Äî because the soul does not separate the physical from the sacred. In the language of dreams, all longing is holy.

You begin to live differently when you carry such awareness. Night no longer feels like escape, but like ceremony. You approach the pillow as an altar, closing your eyes with quiet openness: *If spirit wishes to speak, I am here to receive.*

And in that openness, fear subsides. Even when the dreams come charged, even when they stir embarrassment, they no longer feel like violations. They feel like teachings. They remind you that beneath your routines, beneath your defenses, you are still alive enough to be moved, still tender enough to long, still open enough to be reached.

This is not an answer. It is not a neat explanation to file away. It is a way of living with mystery. A way of carrying dreams as companions instead of burdens. A way of remembering that the language of the night is not against us, but for us.

So the next time you wake from a dream that feels more real than reality, do not run from it. Sit with it. Honor it. Ask it softly, *What truth are you trying to show me?*

And in that asking, you may find that what first felt like seduction was always, in truth, an invitation ‚Äî not into shame, but into awakening. Not into fantasy, but into union. Not into confusion, but into the sacred recognition of the soul‚Äôs deepest desire: to be known, to be loved, to belong, fully, to life itself.",1,1757950572.0,SpiritualAwakening,0,1.0,False

I have this friend that i've known since HS day (we're working right now). I love her, I really do‚Äî but I am not liking of what she's becoming lately, and I honestly don't know what to do.


She's the most caring and loving person I know. She's cute, funny and she carries herself very well. But eversince she was cheated on by her manipulative, narcissistic ex-boyfriend, she's changed‚Äîa lot. She jumps from 1 guy to another (sometimes 2-3), overanalyzes everything they do, and when it turns out that these guys aren't as serious as she thought, she overly victimizes herself and blames her actions on her ex. She also doesn't seem to care if she's hurting another girl, as long as she feels like the guy is choosing her.

And when issues about her lovelife comes up, I try my best to avoid that topic because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm gonna say something that could offend her.

It's only now that l've really noticed all of this. It might sound petty, or maybe it's not, but there are other things that's been bothering me:

She tries to project a certain image to others on social media‚Äîexample, acting like she loves coffee (she hates coffee), or making people think she achieved something (when in reality, she didn't or someone did it for her).

Also, there are times when we have gatherings with friends, and she'll call to ask if I'm coming. When I say I'm not, she'll say she's not going either‚Äîbut then she'll absolutely go. (happened a lot of times)

Am I overthinking things or what? Are those normal? Idk what to do. Please give me advice.

My wife and I have a schedule na every saturday off nya, sunday naman off ko. During these time, we are not to be bothered by our kids or by any chores. Ang joke nga namin is we don't exist during our off days. 

Last sunday, we had an argument kasi I feel like that rule wasn't being followed despite me, following it.   


My side: 

Issue 1: She does our laundry every week. Kaso usually ginagawa nya on a sunday (which is my off). I communicated na sana gawin nya sa week day since pag umaalis sya, sakin naiiwan yung mga bata for a couple of hours. She initially said ok, pero hindi na sunod, instead she'll ask me if I'll go out, if oo, edi mag papalaundry sya kasi nga wala ako sa bahay. If oo, edi sa ibang araw nalang. 

\- - I hate this kasi parang nakasalalay sakin kung kailan yung laundry. Although indirectly, I feel like it breaks the nature of the rule. So minsan napipilitan nalang akong umalis ng bahay, which also make me feel a bit anxious kasi nga walang adult sa bahay. 

\- - She insist na she have to do self service sa laundry since ayaw nyang mawalan ng damit at ayaw nyang ipahawak sa iba yung gamit. I've recommended multiple times to just do full service since we can pay for it at kung may issue sa missing clothes edi lipat at ireklamo. 

Issue 2: That morning, they all woke up around the same time so sabay sabay sila bumaba. Nag lalaro lang ako sa living room and our youngest kept going to me. Which is really fine tbh. so I wasn't complaining. Then she grabbed her coffee and went up. So I was left with the kids, then the other 2 kids were playing loudly (which they were supposed to be playing with the youngest pero nadedma) the youngest wanted to play with me, which again, still fine. Until, the other kids started arguing and I find myself watching over all of our kids. Then she went down, and started scolding the eldest for cooking the rice too wet. Her voice was so loud, kahit para sakin napaka liit ng issue. She was complaining na ayaw nya talagang kumain ng basang kanin. 

She asked me something which I couldn't hear, so I asked ""What?"" inulit ko twice kasi di ko talaga sya marinig. Then I had enough, the 2 kids were noisy, the youngest kept going to me, there's her being mad in the morning just because of a wet rice. Sabay sabay so umakyat nalang ako, and she acted so upset na ""nag tampo ako""

  
Later that day, I brought this up and she also complained na ginagawa ko naman din daw sa kanya so akala nya okay lang. Di na daw sya nag salita nung ako yung gumagawa kasi iniintindi nya ako. (I work night shift so, during her off (saturday) galing akong friday shift nun) Minsan hindi ako nagigising pag sinasabayan ko ng tulog yung youngest.



Her side

\- She got upset kasi di ko daw sya sinagot when she asked me.   
\- I wasn't 100% following the rule fair in the first place so akala nya okay lang.   
\- On the laundry thing, she's not putting the responsibility on me. She was just asking kung ano plano ko on my off, which I also do kapag off nya.   
\- She didn't want to compromise the quality of the laundry since pasok sa preference nya yung pinupuntahan nya. 



On our argument, I said, ""I work 5 days a week + 1 for the kids. I thought that you would think na maybe I deserve that one day that I get what I want for that off?""

ABYG For complaining like this to my wife? I felt like I gaslighted her. 

Context: We got 4 kids, I work night shift, wfh. She's stay at home, she wanted to work but I asked her not to para makapag focus sa mga bata, in exchange. I'll give her 4k allowance a week and 1 day off. ",1,1757950483.0,AkoBaYungGago,3,0.67,False

I am intrigued by their faith and devotion and their values are similar to mine.  They seem very kind, warm, caring and loving.  And they are HAPPY.  Never met a Mormon who is not happy and kind.  

I am born again Christian/non denominational and I was raised that it is impolite to discuss religion or politics (used to be the norm‚Ä¶too bad it still isn‚Äôt- especially with politics and how intolerant people are these days, families being blown apart over political differences is just ü§Ø to me).

I am curious how/what they believe that is different than a non denominational Christian.  Are Mormons Christians too?  They speak about Jesus and I wonder if their Jesus is the same as the Jesus I believe in?  Do they believe in the Holy Spirit?  What are some key theological differences between LDS and Christianity?  

They do seem to live a very strict and regimented lifestyle.  Much more so than a non-denominational Christian which is more centered on having a personal relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ and Savior.  I do find it odd that they wear special underwear and have to attend church for four hours every Sunday, that they have so many kids, can‚Äôt have coffee or tea, etc. 

Do they believe in past lives?  I was reading something a lovely woman I follow on social media wrote about overcoming hardship and she said a few things that had me wondering that.  ",1,1757950472.0,exmormon,4,0.67,False

I confirmed the morning of our get together that she was still good to meet up, and she said that she was ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and was really looking forward to it. Then I showed up and she was very visibly ill and talked half the time about how sick she was and how she probably needed to see a doctor, but insisted she was still fine to hang out!

I told myself, like always, that I wouldn‚Äôt sneak into her closet. That I wouldn‚Äôt sit in front of that old vanity. But the quiet house pulled me in. The lavender scent on her clothes. The silk, the cotton, the skirts whispering my name.

I slipped into a pale blue skirt I hadn‚Äôt seen in years. It hugged my waist like it was waiting for me. Then the blouse. Soft, white, with little puffs at the shoulders. And finally, the lipstick. My hands shook as I smeared it on.

That‚Äôs when I heard the keys.

The door opened. Footsteps on the stairs. My heart stopped. I froze in the middle of the room, half-dressed, half-alive, knowing it was over.

And then the door creaked open. My mother stood there.

She didn‚Äôt scream. She didn‚Äôt cry. She just looked. And then, softly, she asked:

‚ÄúDo you have a name for her?‚Äù

The word slipped out before I could stop it. *Susan.*

She repeated it like it was something precious. *Susan suits you.*

And instead of shame, there was silence. Instead of anger, her hand on my chin, correcting the corners of my lipstick. She whispered: *You‚Äôve always been my daughter too, haven‚Äôt you?*

That moment didn‚Äôt solve everything. It began everything.

For years, Susan lived in fragments‚Äîhidden blouses, lipstick wiped away, nights spent whispering her name into the dark. But my mother never let it go. She taught me makeup at her vanity. She reminded me to breathe when I was too afraid to leave the house. And one day, in a coffee shop, a stranger handed me a cup and said, *Here you go, ma‚Äôam.* I nearly cried.

Watch Full Story Here - [Feminization Story](https://youtu.be/yNsGIeqh3uE)

That was when I knew Susan wasn‚Äôt a phase. She was me.

I started hormones. Estradiol. Tiny pills that felt like keys turning in locks I had lived with all my life. Slowly, my reflection began to change. Softer skin, fuller cheeks, tears that came easier. For the first time, I wasn‚Äôt pretending.

Until it stopped.

The clot came like lightning‚Äîpain in my leg, a doctor‚Äôs face too serious. *Deep vein thrombosis. You need to stop hormone therapy.*

Just like that, Susan was put on pause.

I can‚Äôt describe the grief. To touch your truth and then be told you might lose it forever. I stopped dressing. Stopped showing up online. Nights were quiet, except for one message that always came: *Goodnight, Susan.*

My mom never let the name go.

And maybe that‚Äôs what saved me. Because one day, almost two years later, I found the strength to try again. This time carefully. Patches, tests, slow steps. And when I stood in the mirror after the first one, I saw her again. A little older. A little tired. But real.

Susan.

Seven years have passed since that first day. Seven years of stumbling, pausing, fighting, and surviving. And yet, every time I look in the mirror now, she looks back. Not as a dream. Not as a costume. But as me.

And maybe that‚Äôs the strangest truth of all: Susan was never gone. She was always here‚Äîwaiting for me to finally see her.",1,1757950452.0,Crossdressing_support,0,0.67,False

I was just trying to figure out if hand blenders are worth it for soups and got sucked in. The guy in the video showed this full set from MuellerLiving and I was like‚Ä¶ wait why does this thing have seven attachments?? At first I thought it was too much- who needs a frother, whisk, dual beaters, dough hooks, potato masher and a chopper bowl with their stick blender? But the longer I looked into it, the more I started realizing: this might actually be a really practical alternative to buying 4-5 separate tools.

What I found digging into the MuellerLiving immersion blender set:
It‚Äôs got a 500W motor which is on the higher end for handhelds. Multiple sites mentioned that it doesn‚Äôt stall or overheat during normal use
8 speed settings + a turbo button- probably more control than I‚Äôd need but nice if you‚Äôre blending something delicate vs dense
The attachments are the wild part:
> Stainless steel blending shaft (standard)
> Whisk and milk frother (for eggs, whipped cream, frothy coffee etc)
> Dual beaters and dough hooks (!!) kind of rare for hand blenders
> A potato masher attachment- didn‚Äôt know this was a thing but people said it helps avoid gluey mashed potatoes
> A 20oz chopper bowl for stuff like onions, garlic, nuts, etc.

I checked a few review sites just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt being swayed by clever marketing. A lot of sites reviewed the core model (same motor) and said it has ‚Äúbombproof‚Äù construction and holds up better than most cheap ones. They liked the grip and found it didn‚Äôt overheat, even on longer runs.

Also read a bunch of Amazon reviews (some suspiciously glowing but a lot felt legit) and a few common things came up:
People liked that cleanup is fast.. most of the parts are dishwasher safe
Works great for soups, sauces, baby food, whipped cream and light chopping
Some said the whisk starts to wobble if you use it with heavy batters
Doesn‚Äôt crush frozen fruit super smoothly.. more of a ‚Äúsoft blend‚Äù tool than a full on blender replacement

Not saying everyone needs this but‚Ä¶ If you live in a small apartment or dorm and don‚Äôt want a million appliances taking up space, something like this seems like a solid multitasker. Especially if you‚Äôre into one pot cooking or make a lot of blended things. I also kinda love that it‚Äôs one of those tools that looks gimmicky at first but turns out to be genuinely useful. Like yeah a potato masher attachment sounds dumb until you realize it saves your wrists and gives better texture than smashing with a spoon or fork. Would love to hear if anyone‚Äôs used this one long term. Or if there‚Äôs a better stick blender + attachment combo I should be looking at instead?

I have a go-to meal: 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, and a slice of toast. sometimes I am in a rush to get things done/started at work (we both work hybrid at home) but I know that if I don't eat I'm just not going to be able to get anything done mentally. it doesn't take too long to make, maybe like 15ish minutes, but still an effort every morning. most mornings I ask my boyfriend if he wants some and 95% of the time he says yes. other times I don't even ask and just make him some and he'll always eat it if so.

I'm starting to get annoyed that I make us breakfast everyday and he never makes it for us. in the past if I've mentioned this to him (don't remember exactly how I've mentioned it as it's been a while), he'll say something like 'he's not that hungry enough to make it and could go without it', which is true, if I'm ever not home or at the office that day he just won't eat breakfast, but on the other hand he'll always say yes when I'm making it and offer him some? it would be nice if he took the time and effort to make it for me sometimes.

I don't know how to voice my annoyance to him, because at the end of the day I'm going to make some for myself anyway and there's no difference in me making 4 eggs versus 2, it's just that it would be nice if he took the initiative sometime the way I do every morning. how can I explain this to him? is there even validity in feeling annoyed if I'm going to make it for myself anyway?

edit: occasionally he'll make breakfast for us on the weekend sometimes but it's few and far between, and I sometimes have to ask. so maybe ""never"" is over dramatizing it.

1nhoxq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1nhoxq5/should_the_best_countertop_microwave_sharp/,Should the best countertop microwave SHARP SMC2266KS be your pick,"The Sharp SMC2266KS microwave oven has been on my countertop for a solid two months now, and it has become a staple in my day-to-day kitchen ventures. I‚Äôm one to test products thoroughly‚Äîmicrowaving leftovers, reheating soups, melting butter, defrosting chicken thighs, and even steaming vegetables on busy weeknights. This 1200-watt powerhouse with a spacious 2.2 cubic feet capacity has certainly managed to keep up with my family‚Äôs demands, but it isn‚Äôt without its quirks. Here's a detailed breakdown for anyone considering adding it to their home setup.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Appearance matters to me when it comes to appliances, and I‚Äôll admit, this stainless steel beauty is sleek and modern. It blends right in with my kitchen decor. The gray interior with LED lighting is an upgrade over older clunky interiors. Plus, the white LED display doesn‚Äôt just make it easier to use, but it also offers a touch of sophistication‚Äîand yes, I do care about how a microwave *feels*. That said, fingerprints on the stainless steel surface can be a minor headache if you‚Äôre as cleanliness-obsessed as me. I find myself wiping it quite a bit throughout the week.

**Performance and Power**  
This microwave isn‚Äôt just looks; the 1200-watt power makes short work of anything I throw at it. Frozen foods heat up evenly, and items like popcorn have not come out burned even once, thanks in part to its Sensor Cook Technology. I genuinely appreciate the 10 power levels available because, believe me, warming milk for coffee requires way less intensity than reheating stew. The melt/soften function has saved my life several times in baking experiments, giving me perfectly softened butter or melted chocolate within seconds.

**Winning Points**  
- Large 16.5"" Carousel turntable ensures the food turns smoothly, and no corners of your lasagna end up cold.  
- ""Express Cook"" is an absolute godsend for when you're in a rush, letting you cook with a single press for up to six minutes.  
- The auto-defrost feature actually thaws meat evenly without cooking the edges‚Äîsomething my previous microwave never mastered.  
- Sensor Cook Technology makes it easy to use for a kitchen amateur like my brother, who has no idea what ""cook time by weight"" even means.

[Check SHARP SMC2266KS price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b0cnqb66mb/)

**Ease of Use and Features**  
As someone with children running around, ease of use is paramount. With features like the ""+30 seconds"" button, I can quickly add on extra cook time without restarting the whole process. Also, I put the melt/soften option to the test by preparing caramel for an apple-pie topping, and it worked like a charm, melting evenly. The bright LED lighting inside means no more squinting to see when something‚Äôs bubbling over.

That said, it does lack some app connectivity that modern appliances might have. I‚Äôm not saying you have to control your microwave with your phone, but it‚Äôd be cool to see how long it has left on a cycle while I‚Äôm chopping onions across the room.

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The 33.7-pound weight means moving it around during cleaning isn‚Äôt fun. Once it's on your counter, it‚Äôs likely staying there.  
- Quite a few fingerprints and smudges accumulate on the stainless steel exterior fairly quickly.  
- While it's a large family-sized microwave, it might overwhelm smaller kitchens or cramped counters.

**Competing Products**  
Other brands like Panasonic and LG have their own lines of similarly powered microwaves in the 1200-watt range. Panasonic models, for instance, use inverter technology that some might argue offers better cooking precision, especially for delicate dishes. However, most of Panasonic‚Äôs alternatives have a slightly smaller capacity, usually peaking at 1.6 to 2.0 cubic feet, making the Sharp a better bet for larger families. Compared to LG's more futuristic touchscreen-control microwave, I prefer the traditional buttons and dials here‚Äîtouchscreens can often be temperamental when your hands are damp or greasy from cooking.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
This appliance does exactly what it promises and brings enough power for large-scale cooking, especially for families. Given its performance and sheer size, I‚Äôd say it's a great investment. It‚Äôs not the cheapest on the market, but for the features, durability, and even cooking capacity you get, it feels like a smart use of money.

1nhoudg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1nhoudg/showcase_nalupatio_barstools_comfort_and_style/,Showcase Nalupatio Barstools Comfort and Style Worth the Hype?,"The Nalupatio B0CR6BRVNH has been my latest addition to the kitchen, and after giving it daily spins (literally) for a couple of weeks, I think I‚Äôve gathered enough to share my honest thoughts. These bar stools have a sleek modern look paired with some great functionality, but they aren‚Äôt flawless either. Here‚Äôs all you‚Äôd want to know before adding them to your space.

**Beautiful Design and Versatility**

One of the first things that struck me was how sleek these stools looked right out of the box. The faux leather upholstery with its gentle wrinkles (intentional, might I add) and powder-sprayed finish combined with that contoured, ergonomic shape makes them look so stylish. The all-black color fits perfectly in my kitchen, which has mostly neutral d√©cor. What‚Äôs even better is the adjustable height. With a range from 24.8 to 33.46 inches, these stools can easily switch between a standard counter-height table and a higher bar setting. They blend so seamlessly wherever you put them.

**Ergonomic Comfort That Surprised Me**

Sitting in this stool for longer-than-expected coffee breaks or Saturday hangouts with friends felt noticeably comfortable. The widened seat and backrest contours definitely help provide good support. The faux leather feels soft but not slippery, and the high-density foam cushioning stays firm even after daily use. My teenager has even claimed the chair when gaming at the counter ‚Äì which rarely happens because he‚Äôs picky about his seating.

**Check Nalupatio B0CR6BRVNH price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Swivel Feature**

I cannot emphasize enough how much I‚Äôve come to love the 360-degree swivel on these stools. It‚Äôs smooth, silent, and perfect when we‚Äôre gathered around and turning to grab a snack or join a group conversation. It genuinely feels sturdy, even when my taller (and heavier) brother uses it; the SGS-certified gas lift and metal base handle the weight (up to 300 lbs) like a pro. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that if you‚Äôre using it on tile or wood floors, the rubber ring on the base prevents scratches‚Äîa small but incredibly handy detail.

**Positives**

- Modern, stylish design enhances any kitchen or bar area.
- Adjustable height fits different surfaces from counters to bar tables.
- Cushioned padding and ergonomic shape offer exceptional comfort.
- Built with a robust structure and impressive 300-pound weight capacity.
- Swivel feature is incredibly smooth and makes socializing easier.

**Ease of Assembly: Better but Not Perfect**

Putting these together wasn‚Äôt as daunting as I‚Äôd thought. The instruction manual was clear, tools were included, and I was done assembling both stools in under 30 minutes. That being said, I did have to retighten the screws after a week of use, which was a bit of a hassle. They send these in two separate boxes, which, in my case, arrived a day apart. This isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker but can be frustrating if you‚Äôre in a hurry.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Assembly requires retightening screws after a few uses.
- Separate box delivery might inconvenience some buyers.
- The faux leather texture looks great but might be prone to small nicks with sharp objects.

**Other Options to Consider**

While these stools stand out in design and functionality, it‚Äôs worth mentioning a few other contenders on the market. For instance, if you‚Äôre into a more industrial look, brands offering metal-framed or natural wood stools might suit you better. Compared to similar adjustable models I‚Äôve tried, these hold their ground because they don‚Äôt wobble or feel flimsy, but they may lose sleeves to pricier options offering even denser foam or genuine leather upholstery. 

**Bang for the Buck**

Considering the quality, adjustable height, and design aesthetic, I‚Äôd say these stools are worth the investment for most homeowners. There are pricier options on the market, but they often lack the adaptability that makes this set so versatile. You really don‚Äôt need to spend more to get such comfortable seating with solid build quality and practical features.

my life consists of literally nothing all day everyday. i‚Äôm extremely lonely and depressed. my sister suggested going to college & it was the only option for me to actually socialise, get an education n progress in life. there is no other way. i enrolled n then decided i wasn‚Äôt going to go because i was ‚Äútoo ugly‚Äù (this is my go-to mindset when i am faced with anything). my sister is going completely fine and enjoying her course, which makes me feel worse. 

yesterday, i decided i was going to go. i picked up diazepam from a dealer bc it‚Äôs the ONLY thing that makes me feel normal. i‚Äôve tried all other meds/drugs/alcohol n nothing can defeat my autistic traits. i had 20mg this morning n my original plan was to just go early and meet with the Inclusive team at the college, then leave. diazepam made me confident enough to join the lessons so i did!! i sat in a cramped room full of 30 people (all ages from 19 - 30), i felt OKAY. i survived the first lesson n on my break, i happily went to buy a coffee in the busy cafeteria packed with 16 yr olds, went outside to smoke and socialised with some people. i was sooo proud - i thought id finally get what ive dreamed of. i thought ‚Äúwhen i get home, im going to buy clothes for college, bring in some highlighters n make my notes all cute bc i love calligraphy..‚Äù etc etc  

then, i went to the second classroom. the diazepam wore off quarter way through the lesson. i was struggling to read the whiteboard, which gave me flashbacks to being 12 feeling INSANELY self-conscious n deathly because i couldn‚Äôt read the board. then some nice guy noticed i couldn‚Äôt see, so he offered to let me copy his notes. this set me off because a person SPOKE to me while im on a circle table with loads of people. my face went bright red, again something that often happened when i was a kid n got made fun of. no one even noticed me, yet it just made me feel like ‚Äúi cant i cant i cant i cant‚Äù. mind went completely blank, i heard the teacher say the word break so i just left the classroom. the inclusive worker had to go collect my notebook & speak to the teacher, which im sure everyone else heard. 

i‚Äôm so fucking miserable and hurt and upset. all i want is an education!!! all i want is to not be forced to be so lonely all the time!! my soul is ROTTING bc of the life im forced to live. i may as well be a prisoner because ive been trapped in my house since a child. the autism team i have refer to it as a superpower, and im sure a lot of you guys do so PLEASE enlighten me about how this is a superpower? i‚Äôm so hurt",15,1757949750.0,AutismInWomen,11,1.0,False
1nhot8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1nhot8z/how_to_choose_a_waffle_maker_for_college_students/,How to choose a waffle maker for college students?,"Hey everyone! As a recent college grad who's obsessed with breakfast foods, I wanted to share my experience with finding the perfect waffle maker for dorm life. Trust me, after trying multiple options and making countless mediocre waffles, I've learned what really matters.

First things first - don't waste your money on those fancy, expensive waffle makers. As a student, you need something reliable, compact, and easy to clean. After lots of research and personal testing, I found an awesome waffle maker that's perfect for college life (check it out here: https://athometouch.com/waffle-maker).

Here's what you should consider:

Size Matters
Your dorm room is already cramped enough. Look for a waffle maker that can be stored vertically. The one I use takes up minimal space and fits perfectly in my tiny cabinet.

Non-stick is Non-negotiable
You don't want to spend your precious study time scraping burnt waffle bits. A good non-stick coating is essential. Pro tip: light spritz of cooking spray before each use makes cleanup even easier.

Temperature Control
Basic models with just on/off switches can leave you with burnt edges and raw centers. Look for one with adjustable temperature settings. This lets you make everything from classic Belgian waffles to creative stuff like hash browns or pizza waffles (yes, it's a thing!).

Indicator Lights
This might seem minor, but having lights that tell you when it's preheated and when your waffle is done is super helpful when you're multitasking (like cramming for an exam while making breakfast).

Price Point
You can find really good waffle makers between $20-40. Don't fall for the $100+ models - they're overkill for dorm life. The one I recommend (https://athometouch.com/waffle-maker) hits the sweet spot of quality and affordability.

My Daily Routine
I usually prep my batter the night before (basic mix + water, nothing fancy) and store it in the fridge. In the morning, I plug in the maker while getting dressed, and by the time I'm ready, it's preheated. Perfect waffles take about 3-4 minutes, giving me time to grab coffee or review notes.

Extra Tips:
- Get a measuring cup specifically for batter
- Keep it unplugged when not in use (dorm safety rules!)
- Clean it while it's slightly warm (not hot!) for easier maintenance
- Store it in a plastic bag to prevent dust

Some red flags to avoid:
- Flimsy hinges
- Plastic that feels cheap
- No indicator lights
- Too many fancy features you'll never use

Making waffles in your dorm isn't just about the food - it's about creating that home-away-from-home feeling. Plus, you'll become the most popular person on your floor when the smell of fresh waffles wafts through the hallway!

Remember, a waffle maker isn't just for breakfast. Late-night study sessions, floor meetings, or weekend brunches - it's surprisingly versatile. I've even made grilled cheese in mine (don't judge until you try it)!

Hope this helps you make a smart choice. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments!",1,1757949730.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

Throwaway in case people involved are in Reddit

Me, (F23), got married to my husband about a year ago. It was wonderful and probably the happiest day of my life.

My family was involved with everything and I was delighted by it. Including my stepfather, who at first I had a somewhat rocky relationship with but I grew to appreciate him. His daughter (F26) is an entire different story. We can't get along. I've tried and I'm sure she also has, but it's not about being different, it's because she has always had very similar taste as me. We used to fight about our clothes, our toys and so on.

She has a relationship with a man whom I've got to know maybe 3 or 4 times. She announced her relationship with him during my wedding (which annoyed me at first, but I let it go since it was only a 20 second PSA), and became engaged just 4 months after that. Now, she has been planning her wedding and I've tried to help as much as I can since I already had most contacts fresh. She plans to marry a day after Christmas, so I thought everything was set and ready to go.

On Saturday, she calls me crying, saying that her wedding dress wouldn't arrive on time since she had some changes done. For some context, no one knows how this dress looks because she wanted to 'keep it a surprise for everyone', per her own words. I tried to comfort her and I told her I knew some cute boutiques who had nice wedding dresses ready for her date. She cries harder, telling me she didn't want any 'cheap' dress. I tried to calm her down once more before telling her I would call my stepdad to see what we could do. Before I could finish that sentence, she says out of the blue, 'Can I wear your dress?'

I didn't respond, because I didn't know how to. She goes on, explaining that it would make things less troubling, how she's the same size as me and how much she loved it the second she saw it on me. I don't know what possessed me to simply say 'No.' and hang up the phone. I've received multiple calls from her, her fiancee and my stepdad, who I did respond to. He pleaded to me to let her 'borrow' my wedding dress, 'just like when we were kids'. I tried to explain to him that my wedding dress was very special to me, and I wouldn't feel comfortable letting anyone else in it, unless it was my decision. He got super angry with me and hung up. My messages have been exploding with my stepsister, her soon-to-be husband and my stepdad telling me how horrible I am for being so selfish.

I know how my stepsister is. I know how dramatic and over the top she can be when she doesn't get her way. But there's a part of me that feels awful for not letting her wear it since it's just a dress and it would make her so happy. But there's that other part of me that remembers how my husband, my mom and I struggled to save for it because it was my dream dress, and I don't want to share something so personal with her. Should I just let her have it just so things don't escalate?

Commenter: NTA, I‚Äôm calling shenanigans on your stepsister‚Äôs part. She probably had her eye on your dress since day one, probably commissioned a similar dress (if she even did) hence the surprise, and planned to use your dress as a backup if hers didn‚Äôt show up in time.

**Update (Same Post): December 10, 2024 (Next Day)**

UPDATE 2: Well. That happened. I arrived at said coffee shop just in time. She took half an hour to get there.

I talked as gently as I could with her, explaining how I didn‚Äôt want her to wear my wedding dress and why, since it was so emotionally attached to me. She went absolutely nuts. She called me a selfish cow, telling me how I‚Äôm the most horrible human ever.

I tried to calm things down until I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I knew this was a possibility, so as soon as she started crying, I pulled out her wedding invitation and gave it back to her. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt be attending the wedding, but I hoped it all went perfectly. Her voice couldn‚Äôt get louder at this point. She threatened to come to my house and take it from me.

I simply left the coffee shop without saying another word, and now I‚Äôm home.

***Editor's note:*** *AITAH mods originally removed this post for being 'fake, not hypothetical.' However, I messaged them about it since I couldn't find any proof, and they said they removed it by mistake!*

This is some sort of update to a previous post I made almost a year ago, but some things have¬†*definitely*¬†happened.

Per my last post, my (F24) stepsister (F27) got married last December, she asked for my wedding dress after not wanting to even look for one herself. I said no, I stood my ground and I didn‚Äôt go to her wedding. Fast forward to last month, she and her husband have separated. She says they are only ‚Äútaking a break‚Äù.

I begun to rebuild my relationship with her, I took time and effort to find a way to talk to her and even go out in double dates with his husband and mine‚Äôs. That went really well, up until the break she took with her hubby. She stopped talking to me altogether, ghosted me when I wanted to plan stuff and I figured she only needed some time.

Up until she calls me again, in the middle of August. She wants to come over to my house and talk. I genuinely felt happy to have her come over, since my stepdad kept pressuring to finally make peace. She comes over, we have coffee and she asks to see my closet since she was going out on a date and had nothing to wear. I thought this was full circle moment for both us, so I said yes.

We looked through my clothes and I picked something that went well with her. She said thanks and put the outfit in a bag she brought with her, and left.

Some days pass, and as I was cleaning my own closet I find that the spot where my wedding dress was hanging from, was empty. It was in a garment bag and it was there since I don‚Äôt want it to wrinkle so bad since the fabric was a little fragile.

I freaked out, searched for it everywhere. I realized the last time I saw it was before my stepsister came. I called her and asked sincerely in case I was wrong, she got extremely defensive and hung up the phone. I called my stepdad, he was angry at me for thinking she could do that.

Later, my stepdad calls again. He got my stepsister to tell the truth. She stole it while I was looking for an outfit for¬†*her*. He tells me to calm down and to resolve this like adults, but I called her again and simply said to prepare her lawyers.

This created massive drama within my family, and I was too livid to acknowledge it until my mom called me. Now, I‚Äôm thinking I may be crossing a line, but that dress means too much for me. I saved every penny I got and it truly was the dress of my dreams. I‚Äôm scared to find out if she did anything to it.

AITA for suing my stepsister?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter (downvoted): How does someone steal a wedding dress and OP doesn‚Äôt notice.

Fake and YTA

>**OOP:** I wouldn‚Äôt say my closet is too big, but it is a walk-in one. There were plenty of times I was looking through my shirts with my back against her.

Commenter: Not all wedding dresses are big and pouffy.  
My own wedding dress rolls up about the same size as a pair of standard jeans.  
I'm not saying that this post is true, I'm just saying that assumptions about garment size aren't something to base a rejection of truth on.

>**OOP:** It really wasn‚Äôt puffy. Without all the accessories it would be a really simple A line dress, but I loved it

Commenter: Why did she steal a wedding dress for a wedding that happened 8 months ago?

>**OOP:** That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to figure out. To get back at me I assume?

Commenter: It‚Äôs been days at least. Chances are the dress has already been altered(read ruined) for the sister now anyway. So just filing the report and getting the dress back isn‚Äôt enough.

>**OOP:** I‚Äôm extremely scared and heartbroken of this possibility.

In other words, they are an attempt at happiness which only result in nervous system shocks/overstimulation which is ‚Äúenjoyable‚Äù to one who lives in a constant state of numbness. They are a temporary escape from numbness and create further destruction to the nerves.

Chastity is the only thing that allows one access to spirituality and spiritual superpowers. Your entire mental makeup and perception of the world will be uplifted as your nervous system is nourished and develops. Each ejaculation throws months away, the richest and most concentrated light in your body. Refined biophotons which are incredibly precious. 20-30 minutes of fleshy friction or consumption of grains/animal flesh won't compare to the general state of existence for a developed nervous system.

‚ÄúFirst let's place on the table a teaching of many spiritual sages: That the entire outer world is a false appearance that is occurring wholly in the now; it is your own personal ""false world dream,"" populated with many beings just like your nightly dreams.

The great yogi Ramana Maharshi states that each of us resurrects; or projects, the entire world again in the moments in which we wake up and ego-consciousness stirs -- all the way out to the farthest stars. For a typical mind, this is hard to believe. But to hide a great secret you might make it either improbable or too simple.

In this view even our ideas about ""history"" and ""cause"" are nothing but malleable components of our personal transitory world drama. How many times has it happened that a ""fixed fact"" from the past has turned out to be false? New information comes to light so that past ""facts"" are altered. There is a lot of beautiful land that surrounds my home, with many fruit trees. Up until I week ago, I thought all the avocados trees here had only small avocados. But this week I found a tree bearing a much larger variety. They were very big indeed. And all along this tree was very near my door. The big avocados had been hanging for a long time just above my head on a path that I walk daily. The facts just changed through a surprising and delightful emergence in my life script. Such little miracles happen all the time. ""The Ugly Duckling"" comes to mind as a story about how one's ""plot"" can change. Situations that look bad can suddenly turn out to be good, even better than dreamed.

""Facts"" are seen to be a great flux. Even the ""historicity"" of the world's existence is a flux and can become altered by new discoveries. ""History"" is just one more malleable part of your dream-plot. Just as screenwriters for ""Star Wars"" invented a history of the Republic and the Jedi Knights, you also erect all of the ""historical facts"" that you need to support your daily false world-dream. You actually re-create them every time you wake up in the morning. Then you periodically change even those ""facts.""

This theory of ""the world as dream"" has been supported by my long study of astrology, by my experiences with fasting and taking in different foods and substances, and also by my experiences with sleep and the astral plane.

\[‚Ä¶\]

The world only appears to be solid and substantial. Its solidness is a function of the power of the outgoing life force. I have cognized that upon death, you don't actually leave behind any world at all, or any person. You only ""seem to"" if you believe that you did and carry strong memories (imprints) of the experience. Whatever you ""return"" to -- both after sleep or after death -- is just your set of memory impressions (samskaras) lodged in the body and being resurrected. The entire thing (world) is just an extension of your own body. In reality when your body goes, it goes. When you come back into a body, you re-erect all the externalizations to go with it.

Once you understand this, you will understand that the outer world is actually a completely malleable thing, and subject to laws. And the laws get set up right within your own body. The outer world, with its changing conditions, is predicated entirely on conditions within your astral and physical body.

Now it follows that the more pure your body, the more pure and beautiful your outer world. This is the basic reason that by using a long fast, you can move tremendous things out in the outer world; you can manifest great external changes in your personal world, or even the macro world. The purification of the fast purifies one's outer world; one almost does a ""reset"" of the body, or at least moves nearer to the original pure condition. Likewise, let us consider that various kinds of impurities in the body can darken one's outer world-movie in various predictable ways.

\[‚Ä¶\]

I was thinking about my young life and the period where I discovered masturbation and became a sex addict. I realized that starting that year the outer world began to change in dramatic and negative ways. Within that very month the outer world -- from my family, to my neighborhood, all the way up through kings, oceans, and skies -- began to fall apart.

Getting Kicked Out Of The Garden -- I Remember The Month and Year

I was only thirteen when I somehow was led -- by my own karmic samskaras and the wrong media influences -- to experiment with masturbation. From then I was hooked and I hemorrhaged my precious life substance, more precious than my blood, enacting what is really a sort of ""black homeopathic"" in my body. I was really like a young calf who was bleeding uncontrollably. With no wise father to teach me and guide me I was locked in a mortal struggle. And starting from that time I manifested my own personal ""expulsion from the Garden."" And this, my good readers, is the real expulsion from Eden. It might be stunning if you see this the first time in your own life. There I was at thirteen and the whole world began to change:

\-- Several natural fields near my house, ones I loved because they were wild and with trees, got paved with asphalt and turned into parking lots or high rises. One I was especially fond of had fruit trees in it. Definitely losing ""the garden"" there! Then I began to see this going on all over my town.

\-- My mother and father began to not get along, and then mother divorced dad. A major blow, the end of Camelot, and truly an expulsion from the Garden for the child that I was.

\-- Articles began appearing about overpopulation (Hint, Hint!) -- The nuns at my school began showing us movies about starving Africans and children

\-- There began to be much alarm about ecological disasters and pollution. Books like ""Silent Spring,"" ""The Population Bomb"" and others began to appear.

\-- The horrid ""car culture"" began to develop around me. I began to feel that streets were showing up everywhere in my town. They got wider and wider. They were filling up with strangers, blasting insensibly through my neighborhood in their rolling isolation units.

\-- I began to sense how an increasing population was making my town feel different. Peoples who were foreign and unfriendly began moving into our neighborhood. It felt like everything was speeding up. Never again those early evenings, with a calmness in the air, and the sense of gentle people around in our town, and the smell of dinner cooking as I walked down a friendly street...

\-- Society began to seem very confused. It seemed to be falling apart. I lost my father when he moved out of the house and without his moral support and modeling I had a low self-esteem and morale through high school. The bad feelings fed my sex addiction. Nothing in the world seemed to make sense. There were no answers. In an empty home with a distracted, ambitious single mother, life seemed empty and pointless.

Here the typical mind will laugh and say: ""Well, all of this was happening in the world. It couldn't have had anything to do with you personally.""  But the sages teach that ""all is subjective."" Everything that you see out there is just ""you."" They also teach that whatever you experience -- from the cracks in your sidewalk to the tail of a far away comet -- is all just your own personal karma. And, yogic sages teach that certain actions create ""instant karma.""

And it is obvious that not all people at all times experience the same sort of world. Certainly there were other people in the 1960's and 70's who were experiencing a world-story much different from mine. Maybe they didn't watch T.V. Maybe their family was not divorcing. Maybe they were in some little sheltered culture somewhere. All is subjective and each really lives in his own separate world. Nobody's world is exactly the same. The entire world dream -- including all the people that you populate it with -- are just you and your dream.

I realize now that this was my actual ""fall"" from the Garden. I was bringing it entirely upon myself, not in the past but here and now. By disturbing my ""inner ground,"" I brought disturbance to the ""outer ground."" (Later on as I matured and remained sunk in sex addiction, I continued my ""Fall"" with continued bad news-of-the-world, a terrible divorce and loss of my family life, and so on.) I ""fell from the Garden"" for a very long time.

Even indulging in certain thoughts, or certain types of speech sets up vibrations in you; these vibrations manifest definite reactions, people and circumstances in your life. Whenever I speak a lot of harsh words, for example, I begin to encounter cars rolling down the street blaring rap music, pounding my ears with sub-woofers. How much more the powerful psycho-physical act of sex, and when done out of dharmic context. What it is: A kind of ""dark homeopathic"" that sets up a dark vibration in your body, and manifests definite outer conditions. (More later on the ""Divine Eye"" who always watches what you do with sex and reacts to it.)

As I have been mulling this over in my restrained years, I considered that this strange ""homeopathic"" I performed in my younger years might naturally generate appropriate outer themes. What ""themes"" could be more appropriate -- connected to wanton sexing -- than ""overpopulation,"" ""starvation,"" and ecological destruction out in the world dream? It's a match. By performing the procreative act over and over again in my body in a dissonant, adharmic context, I was manifesting phenomena of over-procreation (and its related conditions) externally in my world-dream. I was building up a powerful vibration of spiritual pollution in my body, and seeing related effects outside in my world-movie. The new over-population story was, like everything else out there, just me. Eden began to disappear.

Tip for the environmentalist: Those beautiful people who are concerned about the terrible ecological destruction going on in our world should add this to their repertoire: Try renouncing immoral sex. Do it for a while and watch for changes in ""the news."" Give it some time. I'll wager that you will never see a positive change without your own sexual restraint and dharmic morality. To find out what ""dharmic morality"" is, just study the old Buddhist canons. Christianity is in perfect step with Buddhism and Yoga in many ways. Meanwhile, for all Christians who don't see the destruction of the Creator's world as a sinful thing, I think that attitude is a serious error.

My sexual sin also produced trends in the people of the world. They became like me. Yogananda suggests that when a man indulges in unlawful sex, he is being overcome in that moment by his less rational, female desire nature. Thus I manifested a desire-mad mother who upset the apple cart of our family. In fact, I manifested an entire society full of desire-mad females and the decline of the family everywhere. I also manifested lustful sex-addicted men everywhere. As I cultivated my secret ignorance, ignorance began to manifest all around me in my world. As I raised the vibration of lust, lust and desire began to manifest in the men and women of the world. As I became a desire being wantonly giving in to desires, desire-beings manifested in my world.

I proved my ""inner ground"" theory further to myself by pursuing sexual restraint. By doing so, I began to see the return of the Garden to my own life. By becoming restrained, storms subsided in my life; personal traumas faded away. My life became more stable. Then I began to see the larger world gradually regain elements of stability; in certain key areas it is beginning to turn around. It takes time. I have some pet ecological and civic dreams; things I want to see happening in the world more. I love how, as I cultivate my celibacy -- firm up my inner ground -- I can go down to the coffee shop and see clear signs of change just reading the paper. It will begin in your own back yard, then Eden will fan out again from there.

The garden now returns for me. My personal life has become more stable and less traumatic as I have practiced sexual restraint. My ""Garden Return"" even happens in literal terms, like finding fruit trees and beautiful land all around me where I live. I can walk outside my door and pull a variety of healthy fruit from the trees. I did not plan this or make an effort. God himself ushers the moral man or woman back into a brighter life and a brighter world. It takes time! Think of all the years that you have been building up the vibration of sin in your body! You have been building a ""dark house"" for a long time. And this is a fact: The change back to the Garden will involve some upset and collapse in the exterior world. Some of these changes will be traumatic. As energy is withdrawn from the evil matrix that a man has built up, the process of collapse can entail some spectacular events in the outer macro-world. But it will be all for the best. The evil house you create has to fall. It is like a dramatic avalanche that signals the warming of spring. More on that another time.‚Äù

These readings hit hard for me. Every time I‚Äôve done anything sexual in the past, even without orgasming, it would change my reality negatively in obvious ways. It makes me so sad to even talk about this. The depression and anxiety that this has caused me was ruinous enough, but it has ruined my world as well. It has made me a misanthrope and ruined my perspective on people. Sex made me feel like an ant standing on shaky ground. I can‚Äôt tell you how on long bouts of chastity I felt so grounded. Secure, grounded, like an oak tree that holds its ground against tough winds. That‚Äôs all I want. Not to feel like a seesaw on precarious balance. All I want is to be happy again, don‚Äôt you? That‚Äôs what the spiritual state is for. Happiness. Joy.

Spirituality is not some magical wishy washy thing or something that is purely psychological and in no way tangible. It is a state of a nervous system which has high electrical conductivity and high concentration of biophotons which results from the conservation of phosphorus in the body. It is the state which deep down, we all want. Happy, satisfied, a lack of boredom, a certain perception of reality that is exciting and almost indescribable. When you were a child you had these feelings. The world was a place which had wonder and magic everywhere. Every emotion was deep and filled with a thousand meanings. Even smells were more vibrant and alive. Sometimes I smell something and it awakens a fleeting childhood emotion in me. I remember how deep smells were for me when I was young, each place had a smell. I can‚Äôt fully describe it right now, but hopefully I can experience these things in the future.

Spirituality is how much life you have, how much light you have. Light = life.

Adapt to the world and become more material/3D by eating meat, hard/more solid foods and having sex. This is essentially the essence of the upside-down pentagram.

Or, develop the light body and increase the number of biophotons by eating lighter and lighter. Fruits, to grapes only, to juices only, then finally air. Adaptation to this world is degeneration. No matter how you eat, your chastity determines the meaning of everything in life. Without chastity, the Paradisiacal diet (fruit) is meaningless.",3,1757949548.0,perfectchastity,0,1.0,False

I make lattes for my wife and I tend to pick up various light or light/med roast beans from different roasters. Lately for some reason everything just tastes like warm milk, the different notes aren't coming through. I often take a sip and can confirm. 

Here's some points I can share:

* Often buying washed beans, but trying more natural and anaerobics lately hoping to get more popping notes.
* Light to light/medium roasts often single origin from various Canadian roasters (Detour, Traffic, Escape, 94 celsius, etc.) 
* Often pulling 1:2.5 shots with 15-20 second preinfusion with a total \~60 second shot time.
* Pulling at peak 6-7 bar pressure with gradual decline toward the end.
* Using well water filtered in a Brita (I was remineralizing distilled water just been very short on time lately with having bought various individual mineral packages). 

I suspect it may be a water issue and I need to get back on remineralizing? Or am I hitting a stretch of just very mild coffees that hit great in filter but not so much in lattes?

1. For profit: STEAM based retail space, holding classes, birthday parties, camps, retail aspect with STEAM based kits and activities and possibly with a coffee/smoothie hangout area for parents. Also could just make this is an art/craft studio with STEAM activities as well

2. Non-profit: Daycare, very much needed in my area but I do not hold the ECE lll license to be the director of the centre. Would maybe hold an admin role instead/also provide backup for people on breaks 

3. Non-profit: community program/building where people can come, meeting groups for seniors, veterans, parent and me classes, having healthy snacks for the groups. Maybe a bingo once a week to raise funds for the centre. Also a community fridge/pantry. 

Ideally I‚Äôd like to have something where I can just make a living, I don‚Äôt need to be rich. I‚Äôd also really like to pay the employees a fair living wage and employee people with disabilities as well. Any advice is appreciated! ",2,1757949102.0,SmallBusinessCanada,0,1.0,False

Here are some good options:

# Membership & Subscription Platforms

* **Ko-fi** ‚Äì Allows both one-time donations (""buy me a coffee"") and monthly memberships. No mandatory fees for creators.
* **Buy Me a Coffee** ‚Äì Similar to Ko-fi, easy to set up for tips and memberships.
* **Memberful** ‚Äì A subscription platform owned by Patreon but more customizable and integrated with your own website.
* **Fansly** / **Fanhouse** ‚Äì Popular for creators who want fan subscriptions with more flexibility than Patreon.
* **Podia** ‚Äì Combines memberships, digital product sales, and courses.

# Crowdfunding (Project-Based or Recurring)

* **Kickstarter** ‚Äì Best for funding creative projects (art, games, books, etc.).
* **Indiegogo** ‚Äì Similar to Kickstarter, but allows more flexible campaign funding.
* **Crowdfunder** ‚Äì A platform for entrepreneurs and creatives looking for backers.
* **GoFundMe** ‚Äì More donation-oriented but still used by some creators for direct support.

# Tipping & Micro-support

* **PayPal / Paypal-me** ‚Äì Direct donations with no middleman.
* **Venmo / Cash App** ‚Äì Simple way for fans to send money.
* **Liberapay** ‚Äì Open-source, non-profit recurring donation platform.

# Specialized for Creators

* **OnlyFans** ‚Äì Though often associated with adult content, it‚Äôs also used by fitness trainers, chefs, musicians, and other creators for paid subscriptions.
* **Substack** ‚Äì Ideal for writers, newsletter creators, and journalists who want paid subscriptions.
* **Gumroad** ‚Äì For selling digital products (art, music, writing, courses) alongside optional memberships.
* **Bandcamp** ‚Äì Perfect for musicians to sell albums, merch, and get fan support.
* **Twitch Subscriptions & Bits** ‚Äì For livestreamers.
* **YouTube Memberships & Super Chat** ‚Äì Built-in ways for creators to earn recurring revenue or tips.

# Crypto/Decentralized Options

1nhohw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1nhohw2/nsv_costco_clothes_haul/,NSV: Costco Clothes Haul,"My wife likes to ""lollygag"" around stores - where we grab a coffee, walk around a store(s) for an hour without the intent of buying anything, but still have fun looking at the merch.  Costco is a frequent target for this.  While I do accompany her, when she starts to meander around the middle section where all of the clothes are placed, I'd generally look wistfully at some of the nice things that were too small for me.  I'd never try anything on - can't have the shame of something not fitting anywhere other than the privacy of a dressing room or my own bedroom.  

  
Well, yesterday, my wife brought over a nice vest and held it up for me to try on.  I was reluctant - she was insistent.  Turns out, it actually fit!  Like, zipped and everything!  That gave me the courage to try on a few more items - a quarter zip, a jacket - and everything actually fit!  It's been years since I've even tried on something that wasn't from DXL or another specialty ""big guy"" store.  Was feeling so good about it we went to a Dick's sporting goods warehouse afterwards and I bought another haul of clothes.

  
In this whole journey so far, this is my most meaningful NSV.  Shopping where regular people shop.  It removes part of that ""You're Different / Other"" label I have in my head.  Just feels really, really good.",42,1757949033.0,Zepbound,5,1.0,False

*Where the Rays Shine, the Jays Roar, and the Odds Dance Like a Misfiring Fireworks Show*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)**  
Let‚Äôs start with the cold, hard stats. The **Blue Jays** (87-62) are riding a 8-4 September tear, powered by a league-best offense that slugs .433 (5th in MLB). Their 178 home runs rank 11th, but their slugging percentage suggests they‚Äôre more than just a power team. Meanwhile, the **Rays** (73-76) are a 38-36 mess, with a 14-19 home record that‚Äôs worse than a toddler‚Äôs nap schedule.

The moneyline odds favor Tampa Bay at **+150** (decimal: 2.50) and Toronto at **-175** (decimal: 1.86). Using our trusty formulas:

* **Tampa‚Äôs implied win probability**: 150 / (150 + 100) = **60%**.
* **Toronto‚Äôs implied win probability**: 175 / (175 + 100) = **63.6%**.

Wait, what? The Rays are the favorites despite the Jays‚Äô red-hot offense and the Rays‚Äô home struggles? It‚Äôs like betting on a toaster to beat a chef in a bread-making contest. The spread (-1.5 for Toronto) and total (8.5 runs) suggest a low-scoring, pitcher‚Äôs duel vibe, but the Jays‚Äô offense has the teeth of a piranha in a pool party.

---

**2. Digest the News: Caminero‚Äôs HR Chase vs. Yesavage‚Äôs MLB Debut**  
The Rays‚Äô **Junior Caminero** is a 21-year-old HR machine, just two dingers shy of the team record. He‚Äôs the kind of player who could hit a moonshot while juggling and eating a burrito. But Tampa‚Äôs home woes? They‚Äôve lost 14 of 19 at Steinbrenner Field, which might be cursed by the ghost of George Steinbrenner‚Äôs forgotten coffee order.

The Jays? They‚Äôre bringing **Trey Yesavage**, a 22-year-old phenom making his MLB debut. Manager John Schneider called it ‚Äúunheard of,‚Äù which is Toronto‚Äôs version of saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre about to pull a rabbit out of a hat‚Ä¶ or maybe a rocket.‚Äù Yesavage‚Äôs ceiling is a 20-game winner; his floor is a guy who trips over his own spikes and becomes a viral meme.

My mother in law caught me at the Super 8 off Route 22 with my coworker last month and apparently spent weeks planning her revenge.

I told my husband I got promoted to night supervisor at the warehouse. Extra shifts, better pay, helping with the kids' college funds. He was so proud. Even made me coffee in a thermos every evening before I left. The guilt ate at me but not enough to stop meeting my coworker three nights a week at that motel.

We'd been careful. Different cars. Paid cash. Never the same nights. But my mother in law has this habit of ""just happening"" to drive by places. She saw my car one Tuesday and started following me.

Thanksgiving dinner was at her house. Twenty-three people crammed around her dining room table. My kids were arguing over drumsticks when she stood up and clinked her wine glass.

""I have something to share with the family,"" she said.

My stomach dropped. She pulled out a manila envelope.

""Since my son works so hard to support his family while his wife works those extra night shifts, I thought I'd make a little photo album of her dedication.""

She dumped the photos across the table. Me walking into room 237. My coworker's hand on my back. Us kissing in the doorway. Time stamps on every single one.

My twelve year old grabbed one before I could stop her. ""Mom? Who's that man?""

The room exploded. My husband just stared at the pictures, not saying a word. My brother in law called me trash. My sister in law covered her kids' eyes. But the worst part was my son, my sixteen year old boy, looking at his dad and saying, ""Please make her leave. Please, Dad. Make her go.""

My daughter was sobbing. ""You lied to us. You lied about working.""

I tried to explain. Tried to say the pictures weren't what they looked like. But my mother in law had receipts too. Motel receipts she'd gotten from the desk clerk who remembered me. Three months worth.

My husband finally spoke. ""Get out.""

Two words. That's all.

I drove to that same Super 8 because I had nowhere else to go. My coworker wouldn't answer my calls. My sister said I made my bed. My kids won't respond to my texts.

I've been here nine days now. The divorce papers came yesterday. My husband wants full custody. My mother in law included a note with them: ""You should have been a better actress.""

My own mother called this morning. Said she's so ashamed she won't even tell her church friends what I did. Said maybe it's better if I don't come home for Christmas. My dad won't even get on the phone.

The motel manager keeps asking if I'm extending another night. I see the pity in his eyes. Everyone here knows now. The desk clerk who gave my mother in law those receipts just shakes his head when I walk by.

My daughter posted on Instagram yesterday. A family photo from last Christmas with my face scribbled out in black marker. The caption just said ""Family of 3 now.""

Summary:  
After 3 different tests, 6 months ago, my highest numbers were:  
**Total**: 276  
**Triglycerides**: 128  
**HDL**: 52  
**LDL**: 198

3 months later/3 months ago:  
**Total**: 157  
**Triglycerides**: 51  
**HDL**: 46  
**LDL**: 101  
**Non-HDL**: 111

I just took a test a few days ago and my results were  
**Total**: 199  
**Triglycerides**: 48  
**HDL**: 52  
**LDL**: 132  
**Non-HDL**: 147

My HDL went up a little bit and my Triglycerides went down a little bit. LDL and Non-HDL both went up about 30 points. However, acute dehydration may have played a part as the first attempt to draw blood failed - of which one of the reasons for that is dehydration.

noteworthy changes in the last 3 months minimum relative to my last update:

* I stopped taking the red rice yeast supplements for this 3 months (statin as many pointed out previously, it was an equivalent to 0.5mg/day)
* Haven't been able to keep up the 20k steps a day due to some hip pain... but I still am either standing or walking 5k-10k steps a day - I no longer sit during the work day
* hot tub and sauna use have dropped (it's summer time, so it's harder to sit in hot water/air when it's so hot outside)
* dinners are basically the same
* snacks have expanded to include potato chips (no sat fat), pretzels, and other ""salty snack"" category items with low sat fat (1-2g/serving)
* overall have been more relaxed in regards to eating out/in (yellow curry, slight increase in red meat, or cheeses on meals when eating out for example)... this has been intentional
* started getting weekly coffee with friends, still drinking green tea most mornings

Still under the magic ""200"" mark but just barely, although these are my **ratios** over time:

* 6 months ago:  **5.3**
* 3 months ago: **3.4**
* now: **3.8**

So I went from ""high risk"" to ""low risk"" to ""slightly elevated risk"" based on the ratios

Some expressed concern over the added sugar in the fruit and smoothies so here are my **HbA1c** numbers:

* 6 months ago:  **4.7**
* 3 months ago: **5.1**
* now: **5.1**

Slight increase since starting the smoothies but seemingly stable over the past 6 months.

It's also worth noting I'm still late 30's, 5'9'', relatively fit, relatively active, bp as of writing this 121/78.. although my weight has fluctuated a bit

* 6 months ago:  **180 lbs**
* 3 months ago: **165 lbs**
* now: **170 lbs**

Anyway, my plan for the next 3 months is to more or less maintain what I've been doing these past 3 months with two changes, conservatively reintroduce eggs (I was eating roughly 4-6 dozen a month... I will try maybe one dozen a month now) and to get one of those incremented water bottles to encourage drinking sufficient water throughout the day (and to use it).

1nhnwcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1nhnwcl/the_neardeath_crash_that_forced_me_to_wake_up/,The Near-Death Crash That Forced Me to Wake Up,"In a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1nh3q49/i_dont_know_whod_read_this_but_i_believe_that_the/), I mentioned that I got into a car crash and was in a coma for 40 days. During that time, I lived through something intense, though I‚Äôm not sure if ‚Äòexperience‚Äô is the right word. It felt more like something I truly lived through, almost as real and vivid as this 3D life, but even clearer and more intense.

I also mentioned that the story is too long to fit in one post, so I‚Äôll be sharing it separately. Some of you suggested making it into a book or a YouTube video. The idea of a book appealed more to me, especially since I already felt drawn to it and even designed a cover. I hope the book idea interests you too, as it will allow me to go deeper, make it more continuous, and add illustrations.

Now, I want to share a bit of my background, because I believe it will resonate with almost every reader, if not all, and it is crucial to the story. Give it  your attention, please.

So here it goes: 

At thirty-seven, I looked like a man in the prime of youth, but inside I felt as if I carried the weight of ninety years. My eyes were blue like the clear sky over Ibiza, my hair carried the golden warmth of Sedona's sands, yet all of it framed a face as cold and lifeless as a block of ice. Everything about me seemed extinguished. I never paid much attention to my expressions or what they revealed, perhaps because I never truly understood them myself. My face had become a mask, unchanging, like a video paused indefinitely, waiting for someone else to press play.

This stillness was not born overnight. It was carved into me through a long history of loss that began when I was only seven. Back then, my life was colored with innocence and the warmth of my parents, especially my father, Thomas. He was a kind and generous man, playful and lighthearted, who worked tirelessly to give me a better life. Though he never finished school, he believed life was about laboring for those you love, even in the harshest of jobs. That belief was shattered when a collapse in the gold mines of Silverton, Colorado, stole his life. With it went my family‚Äôs sense of safety, and my own sense of home.

My mother, Helen, was twenty-six when she became a widow. The vision she carried of a perfect family crumbled overnight. Unlike my father, she was strong, even domineering, and always put herself first. She had been shaped by survival. In the 1980s, she fled Mexico‚Äôs poverty and unrest with her brother, Diego, crossing the border in secret. But Diego never made it. A border patrol‚Äôs bullet struck him down, and without hesitation, my mother left him behind, her eyes fixed on the promise of a better life. Tears and mourning had no place for her; survival was everything.

She found work in a caf√©, serving in secrecy, hiding from the law. That was where she met my father, who stopped in daily for his morning coffee. Their glances turned into sparks, sparks into love, and love into marriage. She never finished her education either, but in that small home she finally felt some stability, caring for her husband and for me.

Fate took it all away. When my father died, her fragile dream of family collapsed. She did not let grief consume her. Bitterness did. All she saw when she looked at me was the ghost of the man she had lost. One day, with a cruelty I could not understand, she left me in the care of my grandparents, Robert and Elizabeth. Her words still echo: ‚ÄúI cannot raise him. He reminds me of what I lost. I need to move on with my life.‚Äù From that day forward, she disappeared. And though I never sought her out, I knew in my heart that she did not wish to be found.

Life with my grandparents was quiet, heavy, and stifling. I became a reserved child, speaking only when necessary, preferring solitude to company. To the other children, I must have seemed strange. I felt older than them, as though I carried the mind of a weary man inside the body of a boy. My grandparents‚Äô fears only deepened my isolation. I was rarely allowed out, except for formal occasions. Most days were long stretches of silence. Meals passed with only the sound of spoons against plates. Evenings dissolved into television hum until Robert and Elizabeth dozed off to jazz records by Chet Baker, falling asleep as though drugged, impossible to wake until morning.

Yet I found solace in peculiar moments. Sometimes my grandfather gathered with fellow veterans. Scarred men, carrying wars in their bodies and memories. They spoke of fallen comrades, then stood in silence to honor them. That minute of stillness was my favorite. It soothed me like nothing else, like an embrace I never received, like meditation before I even knew what meditation was. Sometimes I would drift into sleep in that silence, only to be jolted awake by my grandfather‚Äôs cane, his voice sharp with old pain: ‚ÄúThis is no time for sleep. This is the time to feel.‚Äù

Loneliness shaped me. I had no real friends, only classmates who forgot me as quickly as they learned my name. My companions became books and drawings. What my face could not express, my art and reading revealed. I often sketched skies and birds soaring across star-filled nights, as if I longed to be carried away myself. It felt natural when I chose to study literature and the arts.

But destiny struck again. After two years at university, both my grandparents died in the same year. Elizabeth first, then Robert four months later, as though they had made a secret pact to leave together. I was forced to abandon my studies and retreat into work. The only place I could find was a small neighborhood library. There, I buried myself in routine.

Love seemed far away from me. Women usually passed me by, put off by my coldness, my silence. Yet Leila was different. She came to the library often, her presence lingering among the shelves. She saw something in me that I didn‚Äôt see myself. My mystery drew her closer, my focus seemed to enchant her. Perhaps she imagined a poet or a hidden philosopher beneath the stillness. Step by step, she drew me in, until I surrendered to her warmth.

We married.

But it lasted only a year. One pale morning, I found her letter on the kitchen table. Her words cut sharper than any blade: ‚ÄúForgive me, Alex. You are a kind man, but I find no meaning in life with you. There is no passion, no fire. Everything about you is extinguished.‚Äù

And just like that, she was gone.

Her absence echoed the emptiness I had carried for so long. I stayed in my grandparents‚Äô old apartment, my only companion my dog, Casper. His silent loyalty was the only form of unconditional love I had known in years.

That was my life. A face of ice, a hollow existence. Until fate, once again, decided to shatter it all and push me onto a path I never could have imagined.",2,1757947703.0,spirituality,3,0.75,False

Finally landed on what I'm wondering might be the sweet spot - cans of iced coffee. Would just need a machine like a Bevmax with card reader and pitch the uni for a spot in return for a small revshare. If it goes well, the campus is huge and there's room to scale up to a small side hustle.

- Operation involves a 25‚Äësecond lever pull with pre‚Äëinfusion; optimal grind and tamp are critical, especially for oily vs. light beans.
- Cleaning is simple ‚Äì removable drip tray, wipe‚Äëdown body, but boiler must be emptied each use and descaled 4‚Äë5 times a year.

Why it matters: It appeals to coffee purists who value ritual, but those seeking quick, consistent drinks may prefer automatic machines.

""How do I know they're actually working?"" haunted my thoughts daily. After months of trial and error, I realized I was asking the wrong question entirely.

## What I Discovered About Office ""Productivity""

Here's what opened my eyes: I started paying attention to what people actually accomplished in our physical office versus what they appeared to be doing.

The pattern was shocking:

  ‚Ä¢ Colleagues looking incredibly busy while producing minimal results

  ‚Ä¢ Endless coffee machine conversations disguised as ""networking""

  ‚Ä¢ Surprise meetings that derailed entire days

  ‚Ä¢ Impressive-sounding status updates with zero deliverables to show

I realized physical presence had been giving me a false sense of security. Someone could master the art of appearing productive without actually being productive.

## How I Solved the Remote Accountability Problem

Instead of tracking where people worked, I started tracking what they accomplished. Here's my simple system:

  ‚Ä¢ Daily check-ins with actual deliverables (not time spent)

  ‚Ä¢ Focus on results rather than hours logged

  ‚Ä¢ Clear documentation of what got done each day

This approach made patterns incredibly obvious. Slow days? Totally normal. Consistent lack of progress over weeks? Now that's a conversation worth having.

The crazy part? Remote workers often outperformed their office counterparts when measured by actual output.

## Where This Approach Fails

I'll be honest - this system isn't perfect:

  ‚Ä¢ Some roles are harder to measure with concrete deliverables

  ‚Ä¢ It requires more upfront work to define meaningful metrics

  ‚Ä¢ Cultural resistance from ""butts-in-seats"" leadership can be significant

The pandemic forced this experiment on all of us. Companies that embraced measuring actual work instead of physical presence discovered something surprising: location became irrelevant when you're tracking the right things.

The question shifted from ""How do I know they're working?"" to ""How do I measure the work that matters?""

And honestly? That's the question we should have been asking all along, whether teams are remote, hybrid, or co-located.",7,1757947317.0,remotework,4,0.71,False

Finally landed on what I'm wondering might be the sweet spot - cans of iced coffee. Would just need a machine like a Bevmax with card reader and pitch the uni for a spot in return for a small revshare. If it goes well, the campus is huge and there's room to scale up to a small side hustle.

No blow-up, no fight. Just‚Ä¶ calm certainty. She even started the ‚Äúhomework‚Äù for separation, like looking at DIY paperwork and scanning Zillow for rentals in our district. I thought that was it‚Äîthe end.

But then nothing really happened. She didn‚Äôt file. She didn‚Äôt move. Instead, we slipped into this weird, fragile limbo. We still share the same bed. Sometimes she lets me hug her. Sometimes even kiss her. We even had sex once. But at the same time, she tells me she feels nothing for me, that she doesn‚Äôt trust me, and that she feels miserable in the marriage.

The contradiction is killing me.

On one hand, she accepts things I offer‚Äîcoffee in the morning, hugs goodbye, the occasional cuddle. She‚Äôll sit outside with me, listen to music, even joke here and there. She told me she likes spending time with me‚Ä¶ but ‚Äúnot like lovers or partners.‚Äù When I told her I wanted to show her we could rebuild something new, she teared up‚Äîbut then told me I was delusional.

On the other hand, she‚Äôs flat-out said she envisions her future as ‚Äújust me and the kids.‚Äù She‚Äôs admitted to emotionally detaching as much as possible while we‚Äôre still under the same roof. She told me she sometimes gets a pit in her stomach before our nightly talks because they feel forced. To her, the affection I ask for feels suffocating‚Äîeven though I always ask and she always says ‚Äúsure.‚Äù Turns out, most of those ‚Äúsures‚Äù were just her saying yes for me, not because she wanted it.

The kicker? To the outside world, she‚Äôs separated. That‚Äôs the status she tells people. But she won‚Äôt put anything about it on social media. No paperwork filed. No lease signed. No furniture bought. She‚Äôs talked about being ‚Äútrapped‚Äù and ‚Äúmiserable,‚Äù but she hasn‚Äôt made the moves that would actually free her.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve been trying like hell not to sabotage this fragile limbo. I do the chores, run the house, keep things light with the kids, and check in on her boundaries. I‚Äôve been through therapy to work on my fearful-avoidant wiring. I‚Äôve learned to validate instead of defend, to accept her no‚Äôs, to create safety where there wasn‚Äôt any before.

Some days, I see progress. She‚Äôll linger in a hug, put her arm on my side of the bed, smile when I touch her shoulder, or sit outside with me just to share the silence. Other days, she‚Äôs cold, distant, and reminds me that nothing has changed for her.

It‚Äôs a rollercoaster‚Äîevery high makes me believe we‚Äôre moving forward, every low makes me feel like I‚Äôm just prolonging the inevitable.

I know I can‚Äôt fix this alone. I know she has to decide if she wants to let me back into her heart. But right now, all I can do is keep showing up‚Äîsteady, calm, supportive. Even if she calls it delusional.

Because deep down, I don‚Äôt want the old marriage back. That version of us is dead. I want a rebirth. The question is whether she wants it too‚Äîor if she‚Äôs already halfway out the door, and I‚Äôm the only one still standing in it.",7,1757946923.0,Separation,4,1.0,False

The Glad 13 Gal. Tall Kitchen Handle-Tie Bags immediately had my attention. If you've ever battled with flimsy trash bags that snap at the smallest sign of weight, you‚Äôll understand why I was a bit curious but hopeful about these heavy-duty bags. Right out of the box, the promise of strong handles made me think, ""Finally, someone gets it!"" Designed with a capacity of 13 gallons, these are perfect for daily kitchen tasks, and I gave them a fair amount of testing in my cluttered household of three kids, a hungry dog, and endless cleanup.

The handle-tie design is a game changer. It allows for quick, mess-free trash removal, something I especially appreciated during those chaotic mornings when I was rushing to tie up the garbage before school drop-offs. The secure closure added an extra layer of reassurance that no accidental spills would happen en route to the bin outside‚Äîtrust me, that‚Äôs a massive relief.

**Strong Points**

- Handle-tie closures make disposal effortless and clean.
- The diamond stretch design prevents tearing at the top.
- Well-reinforced build keeps even bulkiest trash tightly packed.
- Perfectly sized for standard kitchen bins.
- Durable enough to handle heavier loads like food waste or small broken items.

For anyone using these in a high-traffic kitchen like mine, [Check Glad 13 Gal. Tall Kitchen Bags price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b00ko8lgvu/)

**Sturdiness That Holds Up**

One of the first things I noticed while testing these was their ability to stretch at the top while staying strong in the middle. With a busy family life, it‚Äôs not abnormal for us to dump wet coffee grounds, last night's leftovers, or heaps of crumpled paper into the bin. The Glad bags handled each job with ease. I never once had to double-bag, and there were no unpleasant surprises from tears or punctures‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs all too common with other brands. The diamond-shaped design is no marketing gimmick; you‚Äôll spot the difference yourself when the trash really piles up.

The size is ideal, fitting snugly in every 13-gallon bin I tested it with. If you‚Äôve faced the struggle of trying to jam an oversized liner into a smaller bin (or vice versa), you‚Äôll understand how much of a headache that saves. These are a go-to for anyone needing consistency without compromise.

**Some Caveats**

- Unscented, so no odor masking for strong-smelling trash.
- The packaging box could use improvement as it feels oddly oversized.
- Bulky and extra-sharp objects may still poke through, so not bulletproof for all types of garbage.

**Direct Competitors**

When pitted against other disposable trash bags, like Hefty or Kirkland brands, the Glad bags genuinely shine in durability. I‚Äôve also tried other products in this category, but Glad‚Äôs handle-tie seal feels more secure compared to the simple flap seals or drawstring types offered by competitors. However, if odor control is your priority, some scented competitors might edge this one out‚Äîbut that‚Äôs really the only place these bags slightly falter. Otherwise, Glad bags hold their ground for both stretchability and weight management.

**Quality for Price**

Considering the price point, the Glad bags seem to meet expectations despite being slightly pricier than off-brand alternatives. The added durability and flexibility make them a solid investment, particularly for families generating a significant amount of waste. What I wasn‚Äôt a fan of was the fancy packaging. It felt unnecessary and certainly not reflective of what‚Äôs a simple household product. With that said, they do deliver on function where it matters most‚Äîkeeping trash where it belongs.

Just a bit of a rant. 

When my housemate first moved in she spent her entire paycheck on snack food, no general household needs like toilet paper, cleaning supplies, laundry supplies etc. 

She helped herself without asking to my cooking oil which turned out to be off, somehow using HALF the practically untouched bottle in under a few days before she stopped using it all together, I'm assuming she also realised it was off. 

Because of having nothing she asked to use my laundry detergent which I was fine with, expecting her to maybe use a few small scoops and then buy her own. After a week or two she brought her own and mine was fine ‚Äì there was still half in there. 

I come back home today (it's been maybe two months since she's moved in and I obviously had a new box) to wash my clothes and there's fucking NOTHING LEFT. How do you go through my WHOLE BOX so quickly??? I can't even wash my clothes anymore and I don't get paid for two more days. What was in there should have lasted at least two weeks?

Did I mention hers was still there? I'm honestly tempted to be petty and just take half of hers since I literally have nothing to wash my clothes with now, but I'm trying to be calm since I'm moving soon. 

Theres two other things that I've been iffy about being annoyed over so feel free to tell me I'm wrong for this. These are shared items (the hand soap she's never paid to replace though even though we both used it, for the first day I just used the handsoap in the kitchen and I'm almost certain she just wasn't washing her hands until I moved it because the soap wasn't in the bathroom)

Hand soap. Before she moved in I restocked it and within the first few days there was literally nothing left and I had to start using the soap I had in the kitchen. 

Toilet paper. I had a new heap of toilet paper when she moved in and it was going like she was using HANDFULS of toilet paper each time or something. Like for example I could restock the toilet paper holder in the morning and by the time I come back in the afternoon it's just under half way already, sometimes less. 

Maybe I am just use to the minimum because I know when I was living by myself it was never going that fast and I was using enough. A roll would always last two or so days. Even with my last housemate a roll would last two-three days while now a roll would last one day and then MAYBE the middle of the next day. 

I also know in the year me and my first housemate lived together we hardly needed to replace the soap. Obviously we did every now and then but my point is it NEVER went down as quickly as now.

I don't know, I'm just sick of coming out to do something whether it's make food, wash my hands or clean and I literally can't because everything is literally gone. 

Bonus points to;
‚Äì Buying a set of spoons when my last housemate moved out and when my new one moved in suddenly there's only two. 

‚Äì Her dirtying my things that I've left out for both of us to use but she expects only me to have to wash them even though, again, I've left them out for BOTH of us. It feels like if I brought a plate and was like ""hey, we can both use this plate"" but because I brought it she expects me to wash it after she eats off it.

‚Äì Telling her she can use my suger and coffee but there was IMMEDIATELY a massive mess around it that was never cleaned up until I did it myself.

1nhnd6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nhnd6j/hot_chocolate_maker_vs_instant_packets_which_is/,Hot chocolate maker vs instant packets: which is more convenient?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a hot chocolate kick lately, and I wanted to share my experience comparing those instant cocoa packets to using an actual hot chocolate maker. Trust me, this journey has been eye-opening!

For years, I was that person who'd just rip open a packet, add hot water, and call it a day. It was quick, sure, but let's be real - it always tasted kind of... meh. You know that weird artificial aftertaste? Yeah, that one.

Last month, I finally caved and got myself a dedicated hot chocolate maker (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker), and holy moly, what a game-changer! Here's what I've discovered:

The Convenience Factor:
- Instant packets: Just add water, stir, done
- Hot chocolate maker: Pour milk, add real chocolate, press a button

Now, you might think instant packets win on convenience, but hear me out. With a proper hot chocolate maker, you're getting cafe-quality drinks at home. No more watery, disappointing cups! Plus, these machines heat and froth your milk perfectly every time.

Cost Breakdown:
- Instant packets: About $0.50-$1 per serving
- Hot chocolate maker: Initial investment, then about $0.75 per serving using real chocolate

The best part? You can experiment with different chocolates - dark, milk, white, or even mix them up! I've been using mine to make amazing drinks with Belgian chocolate chips, and it's literally restaurant quality.

My favorite unexpected perk? These machines are super versatile. Mine doubles as a milk frother for coffee drinks too! If you're interested in checking it out, here's that link again: https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker

Some pro tips I've learned:
- Whole milk makes the creamiest hot chocolate
- Real chocolate chips melt better than chocolate bars
- A pinch of salt enhances the chocolate flavor
- You can add vanilla extract for extra depth

The cleanup is surprisingly easy too. Most parts are dishwasher safe, and there's no powder residue like you get with instant packets.

Look, I get it - instant packets are convenient. But if you're serious about your hot chocolate (and who isn't?), a dedicated machine is totally worth it. The difference in taste is night and day, and the convenience factor is actually pretty comparable once you get into a routine.

Plus, there's something really satisfying about making proper hot chocolate from scratch. It feels more special, you know? Perfect for those cozy winter nights or when you're craving something truly indulgent.

1nhn9ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nhn9ik/aita_for_considering_legal_action_against_my/,AITA for considering legal action against my husband's aunt for exposing my affair with a slideshow at family game night?,"Edit: [with ALL UPDATES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Beh4JXyQPsk&t=242s)

My husband's aunt caught me at a motel with my affair partner and projected the photos during family game night in front of forty people including my kids.

I know how that sounds. I know I'm the villain here. But I need to know if what she did crossed a line because I'm considering legal action and everyone says I'm insane.

My husband and I have been married twelve years. Three kids. Big house in the suburbs. The whole perfect family image. Except it wasn't perfect. He worked constantly. Barely looked at me anymore. We were roommates who happened to share kids.

Six months ago I met someone at my yoga studio. He actually listened when I talked. Made me feel alive again. We started meeting up after class for coffee. Then lunch. Then other things.

I got careless. Started telling my husband I deserved better while sneaking around with this other guy. ""You're lucky to have me,"" I'd say while getting dressed up for another ""yoga class."" He'd just nod and go back to his laptop.

His aunt never liked me. She's this busybody who shows up uninvited and judges everything. Always making comments about my clothes, my parenting, my spending. She lived nearby and had way too much time on her hands.

One Thursday she saw me leaving the gym without my yoga mat. She followed me. To the motel off Route 9. Sat in her car taking pictures of me and my affair partner going into room 12. Pictures of us in the window when we forgot to close the curtains all the way. Pictures of us leaving two hours later.

She didn't confront me. Didn't tell my husband. She waited.

Two weeks later was our monthly family game night. My husband's whole family comes over. His parents, siblings, cousins, everyone. About forty people total. Kids running around. Tables full of food.

We were setting up Pictionary when his aunt stood up. ""I have something to share,"" she announced. She plugged her laptop into our TV. ""I think everyone should see what kind of person is hosting us tonight.""

The first photo filled our 65-inch screen. Me walking into that motel room. My affair partner's hand on my back.

The room went silent. My mother-in-law gasped. The kids were confused, asking what was happening.

The slideshow continued. Each photo worse than the last. Me kissing him in the doorway. The window shots that showed way too much. My car parked outside for hours.

""Turn it off,"" my husband whispered. But she kept clicking. Photo after photo.

My teenage daughter started crying. ""Mom, what is this?""

I couldn't speak. Couldn't move. Just stood there watching my life explode on the screen where we usually watched Disney movies.

""I followed her for weeks,"" his aunt said, clicking through more photos. ""This is who you all defend. This is who sits here judging me for being 'nosy.'""

My husband walked out. Just left. His brother followed him. My kids ran upstairs. People started leaving without saying anything.

His aunt packed up her laptop. ""Maybe next time you'll think twice before telling people how lucky they are to have you."" She left.

That was three weeks ago. My husband moved in with his brother. Won't answer my calls. The kids are staying with him because our daughter refuses to come home. Everyone in town knows. I can't go to the grocery store without people staring. Had to quit yoga. Lost most of my friends.

The other guy ghosted me immediately. Blocked me on everything.

My lawyer friend says I might have a case for invasion of privacy or intentional infliction of emotional distress. She says what his aunt did was revenge porn, basically. That she had no right to share those images with my children present.

But everyone I tell this to says I'm insane. That I deserved it. That I'm the one who destroyed my family, not her. My own sister said ""You got caught. Deal with the consequences.""

The thing is, I know I cheated. I know that was wrong. But did my kids need to see that? Did my elderly in-laws need those images burned into their brains? Couldn't she have just told my husband privately?

She humiliated me in front of everyone on purpose. Used my children as collateral damage. That feels like it should matter legally, even if I'm the cheater.

1nhn38l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhn38l,Advice/reassurance after seeing roaches in apartment,"

Hi everyone! I know you get a million posts a day so I appreciate anyone‚Äôs help. I‚Äôm just feeling really hopeless, and I guess I‚Äôm looking for some words of hope and/or advice.

For context, my boyfriend and I live in Boston and have been in our apartment for four years. It‚Äôs an old building with lots of cracks, but we haven‚Äôt seen any signs of pests in four years.

September 1 is the big move-in day for Boston. We live in a complex, so we got a few new neighbors that day. 

Last Monday, I opened one of the cabinets in the kitchen while doing dishes and saw a cockroach. It ran away before I could get a good look. For context, the cabinet is in the corner of our kitchen but the only food in there was coffee grounds. We immediately threw the coffee grounds out and put sticky traps in all the cabinets, in the crack between the fridge and the wall, in the crack between the stove and the counter, and flush against the dishwasher.

The next day, around 4:30 or 5, I went into the same cabinet to clean and again saw the cockroach (it was the same size and everything but of course could have been a different one). It actually didn‚Äôt run lightning fast and didn‚Äôt immediately run into a corner, but in my panic i still let it get away. 

I didn‚Äôt see any stripes on its head, and we also didn‚Äôt catch any cockroaches in any of the traps so I was starting to feel like it might be ok. We also took the fridge out and there was absolutely no evidence of cockroaches behind or under the fridge. 

Friday night, though, I came home from my friends house and found a cockroach stuck to a trap on the counter directly beneath where the original roach was (it was on the counter because my dog thinks the traps are toys so whenever he‚Äôs home alone I move them out of his reach). Two stripes on its head. Definitely a German cockroach. It looked like an adult male but I‚Äôm not an expert. I have attached photos.

The next day, I ordered a bunch of airtight containers for all our food. My boyfriend and I also went through the cabinet under the sink, the one where I originally saw the roach, and the one next to it, which has a lot more food. We saw no evidence at all under the sink or in the cabinet where I originally saw the roach. There was a very small cluster of droppings in the cabinet next to it but nothing else. We sprayed alpine in all of these cabinets.

I checked the traps this morning. No roaches, no new signs of droppings anywhere in the kitchen. But when I was brushing my teeth this morning, what I think was an instar crawled into the sink. I immediately killed it. (Photo attached.)

My boyfriend thinks all the signs point to roaches being displaced from a neighboring unit and trying to find a new home, but I‚Äôm really worried we have a full blown infestation. I feel like I‚Äôm seeing so many mixed signs, I.e. the traps not catching anything even after spraying alpine, not seeing roaches in the hot spots, etc. But now I‚Äôve seen two roaches during the day in two different areas of our home, so I don‚Äôt know what to think. Every time I feel like I can relax a little and start to feel safe in my home again, something else happens. 

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering what an experts read on this is. I didn‚Äôt wanna go overboard by pulling all the appliances out but now I‚Äôm thinking we might have to. We‚Äôre going to go through the rest of our cabinets tonight, make sure everything‚Äôs in air tight containers, spray alpine in every cabinet, etc. We‚Äôll also go through the bathroom this week. 

We‚Äôre also going to work on getting rid of all cardboard boxes, but to be honest, we both work really tough jobs and don‚Äôt have a ton of time before bed to be doing all of this so I don‚Äôt know if we can get it all done today. I‚Äôm also really scared of cleaning at night and seeing roaches running around lol. We‚Äôve also submitted a request with the maintenance for our building and they said they‚Äôd treat our apartment and the surrounding areas. 


Sorry ‚Äî I know this is really long. I would love any advice people have or anyone‚Äôs read on this situation. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for reassurance that it‚Äôs not hopeless. I know that, in a sense, we can‚Äôt totally eradicate the problem because we live in an apartment building, but I‚Äôm really hoping we can manage it to the extent that we just get a few wanderers once in a while.

1nhn33k,https://www.reddit.com/r/10xPennyStocks/comments/1nhn33k/img_coffee_crypto_and_ai_the_ultimate_10x/,"$IMG: Coffee, Crypto, and AI ‚Äì The Ultimate 10x Moonshot You‚Äôre Sleeping On! Wake up!","What‚Äôs brewing, r/10xpennystocks? If you‚Äôre not eyeing CIMG Inc. (NASDAQ: IMG), you‚Äôre missing out on a hidden gem in the coffee and digital health space that‚Äôs screaming 10x potential. Current price? A measly $0.25 (post-surge from $0.20). Market cap? Just $9.6M. This former specialty coffee player (ex-Nuzee) is pivoting hard into a digital health and consumer goods juggernaut, and the catalysts are stacking up. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm loading the boat and betting on $IMG to hit $2.50+ in the next 12-18 months.
Bull Thesis: Why CIMG Is a 10x Banger
1. Maca Noni & Baijiu: Explosive Product Expansion in a Booming Market

CIMG‚Äôs new Maca Noni beverages (think maca peptide coffee and health-focused drinks) are blowing up. They snagged the 2024 China Annual Most Innovative New Consumer Brand Award from iiMedia Research, signaling massive market validation.
Distribution deals are scaling FAST: Agreements with multiple PRC distributors to place Maca Noni in 25,000+ uSmile PetroChina stores, 550 Lawson stores, and 300+ vending machines within 12 months. This is a massive retail footprint in China‚Äôs $50B+ beverage market.
Their subsidiary launched Huomao Jiangxiang Baijiu, a premium health-focused liquor blending Traditional Chinese Medicine principles. It‚Äôs live on major Chinese e-commerce platforms and expanding globally with brand ambassadors in Singapore, Japan, Germany, and more. Stock jumped 25% after-hours on this news alone ‚Äì proof the market‚Äôs waking up.

2. Bitcoin Bet: A Crypto Hedge That‚Äôs Pure Genius

CIMG dropped a bombshell with a $55M stock sale for 500 Bitcoin (220M shares issued). At ~$60k/BTC, that‚Äôs a $30M BTC reserve on a $9.6M market cap company! CEO Wang Jianshuang is doubling down on a long-term Bitcoin strategy, calling it a ‚Äúsolid value foundation.‚Äù With BTC potentially hitting $100k+ in 2026, this could 3x their asset base alone.
This isn‚Äôt just coffee anymore ‚Äì it‚Äôs a crypto-hybrid play diversifying revenue and hedging against inflation. Talk about visionary.

3. AI & Blockchain Pivot: The Tech Edge

CIMG signed an MoU with FLock Technology for privacy-preserving AI solutions. FLock‚Äôs cred? They‚Äôre an AI partner for a major global intergovernmental org. This positions CIMG at the forefront of digital health innovation, blending MarTech and blockchain to supercharge sales channels.
Their dual-pillar strategy (crypto + wellness) is a bold bet on emerging tech. With a tiny market cap, any traction here could send the stock parabolic.

4. Insane Valuation & Insider Confidence

At $0.25, CIMG‚Äôs P/B ratio is dirt cheap for a company with $30M in BTC and growing retail revenue. Insiders own 65% of the company ($3.4M worth) and bought 1.75M shares last year at higher prices, signaling huge confidence.
Q4 2024 10-Q shows no substantial doubt about continuing operations, with cost-cutting and new product revenue kicking in.
Compare this to coffee peers like Black Rifle (BRCC) or Coffee Holding (JVA) ‚Äì $IMG‚Äôs market cap is a fraction, but its growth vectors (China retail + crypto + AI) are unmatched.

Risks? Priced In, Baby

Financials are shaky (negative equity, revenue dips), and Nasdaq sent a non-compliance notice, but CIMG secured listing continuation until Sep 30, 2025, with a solid compliance plan (capital raises + contracts).
Dilution from the BTC deal? Sure, but 500 BTC on the balance sheet more than offsets it. China market risks? Their global expansion mitigates this.
Analyst price target at $0.50? That‚Äôs conservative ‚Äì I‚Äôm eyeing $2.50 if BTC and retail sales deliver.

I‚Äôm stacked up on $IMG at $0.22 average, and this feels like catching Tesla at $10 pre-EV boom. Coffee heritage, China retail dominance, Bitcoin reserves, and AI tech ‚Äì this is a unicorn in the making. Load up before the next 25% pop turns into 250%. DYOR, NFA, but $IMG is my top pick for 2026.
TL;DR: $IMG = Maca Noni retail explosion + Bitcoin reserves + AI/blockchain pivot = 10x from $0.25 to $2.50. Who‚Äôs riding this coffee-crypto rocket? ‚òïüöÄ
