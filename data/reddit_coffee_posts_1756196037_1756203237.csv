1n0htxj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0htxj,Vintage De Sede vs Natuzzi Italia?,"I'm trying to decide between two sofas and am absolutely stuck.

I bought a sofa online in February which was not comfortable.  I like to put my feet up on coffee table and slouch back when watching tv/movies, so I sold it.

  
I upgraded my rug/coffee table at same time to get rid of basic IKEA, and have added more furniture, lighting and art since then (second pic with old sofa)

I was looking at vintage designer sofas from the 80s to lean more to the target ""miami penthouse"" feel - or curated masculine 'bachelor pad'

I went to look at one which looked amazing but was very low back, so wouldn't have been comfortable.

Nearby was a Natuzzi Italia branch and I ended up doubling my budget to buy their flagship IAGO (top pic) because it was supremely comfortable - supported my slouch watch position, built in retractable head-rest (which I didn't use but nice to have), and deep seats (111cm deep) so I ordered it in black leather.

  
Increasing my budget opened a up a new tier of vintage sofa and I've just sourced the vintage white leather De Sede - 

They look similar from the front but the De Sede has more a unique design, which suits my desire to have a statement piece that is unique.

The De Sede wins on style, but it's overseas so I can't test its comfort.  So the Natuzzi wins on comfort.

The De Sede is more expensive, but should hold or increase in value.  The seller says it's in excellent condition for its age.

Once bitten with purchasing a sofa online (admittedly a £1199 Valencia Theatre Seating) that was uncomfortable I'm cautious about taking another risk

The De Sede is 100cm depth vs 111cm



I'm just wondering if I'm right to be cautious - or if a vintage De Sede will still be comfortable and fine to sit on?  My previous sofa was an IKEA Skogarby which lasted me 7-8 years and was fine.

  
Which one should I go for?  If the Natuzzi is a 10/10 comfort, I'd be fine with an 8 or 9 comfort level of the De Sede",1,1756202985.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1n0htr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1n0htr8/choosing_one_tiny_habit_each_week_helped_me/,Choosing one tiny habit each week helped me finally make progress,"For a long time, I tried to change everything at once workouts, study routines, morning rituals and I’d crash in a few days.

So I shifted to something smaller: one habit per week. The key was keeping it almost laughably simple, like:

* Drinking a glass of water before coffee
* Pausing for one breath before opening my laptop
* Writing a single line in a notebook before bed

Doing less but doing it consistently worked better than my “all or nothing” cycles.

I’ve also been exploring other micro-habit ideas that reinforce this, and it’s been a big help on stressful weeks.

Curious has anyone else tried the “one small change at a time” approach? What was your habit, and did it stick?",1,1756202964.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Is this going to be a long term issue?","I’m a night owl, always have been since before I met my boyfriend. My boyfriend stays up late sometimes, but is not a “night owl” so to speak. We have been together for 5 years.

The last year, we have been having issues in our relationship, such as his alcohol benders, him not seeming as interested in me, and most recently, he began to have an issue with me hanging out with friends late at night, which I have *always* done. 

I want to make it clear that I have been staying out late for YEARS. It was never an issue for my boyfriend until a month ago. It’s not an issue of me neglecting him, because we spend time together during the day/evening and he is ASLEEP while I am out with these friends. We usually just drink coffee and chat. 

He seems to have less of an issue if our female friends are there as well, but this isn’t always the case. Sometimes I am the only girl. 

Now, when I am out I get texts from him such as “I hope you’re not out with those goofs” or “You better not be with those losers”. There are 2 of them in particular that he hates/feels threatened by. He admitted last week to coming to spy on me after downing a bottle of wine. 

I don’t even tell him anymore. For the last few weeks, I tell him I am going to a girlfriend’s house and don’t even mention the guys anymore. He asked about it and I said “I don’t see them much anymore” even though I still do almost every night. 

This feels like I am sneaking around and I don’t like it. I know that I am not doing anything sketchy with them, but I’ve never kept anything from my partner before. But I am tired of the suspicion, jealousy and anger towards who I want to spend time with.

Is this uncool on my part and is there a better way I can handle this?  

EDIT: I forgot to mention that he doesn’t come out at night because he wants to sleep, but I do ask him. ",1,1756202658.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

More than an hour has passed and I still find myself sitting, contemplating the emptiness of this vessel. 

It reminds me of my heart. 

Is this absence caused by the disappearance of a star from my system? 

Has my world stopped turning? 

Or perhaps it never truly did? 

For in the constellation of my eyes, there was only my reflection, no independent star ever shone. 

I am caught in this time loop, constantly questioning the solitude I feel. 

I see nothing but a burning desire for love and recognition, as a human being unwillingly placed into this world. 

Is that asking too much? 

Should I resign myself to being enough on my own? 

The answer leaves no room for even a single doubt. 

And yet it is so difficult to admit. 

To feel like an uninhabited shell, drifting with the waves. 

Desperately searching for someone to fill the hollow that wounds me so deeply, leaving my heart to writhe.

Decisions for Matcha Festival MOA,"Hello I plan to go to the Matcha Festival this week and I've seen the menu on [spot.ph](http://spot.ph) article. I can't seem to choose for my plan, but what I'm thinking is to go with the flavor I haven't tried yet. Here are my plans and maybe you can tell me if any one of it will be really good than the other.

* **Day Off Space**: Banana Cream Hojicha / Coconut Cloud Matcha or Hojicha
* **Take Five Slow Bar**: Hojicha Oatchata (what is this? Hojicha in oat milk?) / Honeycomb Matcha (I already tried Honeycomb Hojicha in Be The Reason cafe, and it's so good. Curious to try what Matcha flavor for the Honeycomb is like)
* **The Matcha Tokyo**: Hojicha Earl Grey (tried Matcha Earl Grey already from the Travel Club store collab) | I'm also going to try their Burnt Basque Hojicha Cheesecake i guess >\_<
* **Ujisan**: Hojicha Strawberry / Spanish Hojicha / Sea Salt Hojicha / White Hojicha? (What is this one? White chocolate? or White coffee?)

I'll be there for one day only, so I can't just be back again to try the other flavors. I might get 2 drinks, one i'll drink on that same day and then save the other for the next day. I really like both Matcha and Hojicha, but I seem to be leaning more on the latter because of how most stores don't have it much. I mean usually tea cafes do, but a lot are so far from my place. The nearest I can go to is the Be The Reason cafe in Tektite Ortigas Center and Tsujiri in Podium. Oh right I haven't tried Matchanese in Podium yet. I just kept forgetting that place haha oh well.

I think I'll pick Ujisan and or .................... D:

1n0hlx1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0hlx1,Hungry for Apples?,"Finished up the game and did all the achievements. I feel like it was a little short for its price point. The story was a little flat and the towns people mean lol. The quests were also a little vague at times and I found myself running around for days trying to figure out what to do.

I really liked the scanner mini game, kinda just zened out as I rapid fired checked out people. I found that ignoring the orientation of the item and the random glowy part is what you need to do. I would go so fast that it would get stuck ignore the correct input until I spun the item for it to reset.

I wish the towns folk would give you tips like, I wish you had the dairy next to veg, or your store is too spread out. It would give you a reason to talk to people. I felt like people got mad for no reason in my store. Also the 10 fishy stick quest was... Well I made a post on that already.

The last 2 achievements I had to do were the 10 messes in one day and the apples. I swear any other day Ms. Anderson is shitting herself in my store multiple times. When go for the achievement I was getting 1 mess a day. What was the cherry on top was once I got the achievement and cleaned everything the very next day Ms. Andering shat herself 5 times in a row. She must of had too much coffee.

Then there was the apples. After the fishy sticks quests I realized having my produce in the back was not the best. There no tracker for anything so without totally destroying my store I made the whole front row apples with some other peppered around. A little fun and challenging with the space of the store, but again I just wish there was more explanation on how the flow of the store works and more detail on appeal and such. 

All in all I had fun. Hopefully there will be some free DLC with bug fixes and story/ quest expansion.",1,1756202180.0,Discounty,0,1.0,False

It’s driving me away…how can I ask him not to?,"I went out with this guy on a first date after we talked for 5 days on an OLD app. We just had a dinner and went for a coffee. Spent 6-7 hrs total on the first date on Friday night a week ago last week. 

He’s now sending me many photos of mainly himself. He sent me his city photos too (which were very pretty because he lives in Europe), but mainly himself. Like morning of himself before he went to work in a work attire, which was him dressed in a simple T-shirt and jeans. I don’t care for jeans. No one at my work wears jeans to work except casual Friday. Nothing appealing to me. And who wears jeans in boiling hot summer? No one here wears jeans in this weather…too hot. 

When he was helping moving his friend to a building without elevators this past weekend, he snapped several photos of himself and sent me his pics with his face and upper body. He changed his shirt to another shirt mid way through because he was too warm in that attire so he changed to a new athletic tighter shirt. It wasn’t great looking athletic shirt it looked worn out…

I’m turned off by this. It almost feels like a stranger man sending me unsolicited photos of himself and I have no feelings for this guy, just yet. I talked to him last weekend for 5-6 hrs on the phone and it was fun to talk to him. We text everyday. He always text me but I don’t necessarily reply. 

How it feels is a bit similar to seeing a shirtless stranger man on OLD apps, which is known to be the most cringe picture among most women. It’s not as bad as seeing a shirtless guy on his bed (it’s so cringe) or fish or dead animal pic but I dislike a guy who I have no feelings for sends me countless of his own selfies. He sent me like 10-15 selfies of himself in three days. I don’t like this. 

I’m not that attracted to him. Maybe he’s 5/10 for me. He found me very attractive as he told me “I’m very attracted to you.” at least 6-7 times over and over in different days. While I’m flattered I don’t want to see unsolicited selfies of semi-stranger guy. He asked me, “Am I attractive to you?” to which I answered, “I’m not just yet.” “It takes me a while to feel attracted to a man as a romantic interest.”, which is true. I also asked him to eat healthier and lose weight as I’m into healthy eating and fitness. I was honest with him. 

I dislike him sending me so many unsolicited selfies. I don’t know what kind of culture this is but I would like him to stop. I didn’t say anything about it yet. Don’t know what to say actually. I just didn’t reply to any of the selfies. I didn’t find him attractive physically. He’s just ok. Not ugly but nothing more. I was hoping his personality would be more appealing. But this needs to stop. 

How can I ask him to stop sending me unsolicited selfies but not to hurt his feelings at the same time? 

And why does a guy send so many selfies of himself?! Does a guy think a woman he’s interested in somehow feel attracted to him by sending me countless selfies of himself?? Very puzzling…

1n0hiup,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0hiup,Found in an old SciFi paperback,"A bit of a story with this one!

Last week I took my daughter on a little trip to Paris for Rock en Seine. She forgot her book so I let her have mine and at the first opportunity I went to a bookshop in Paris, Abbey Bookshop, and found my favourite thing - an old, well-read SciFi paperback so I had something to read.

It's an OK story, a bit dated now. One chapter from the end, a card marked the last reader's place. On the face, a hotel name & address, on the reverse, a name and a business address.

I did a bit of investigation. This book was printed in 1975. The condition is poor but this seems to be because it once got wet, rather than handled by many readers. 

Marvin passed away aged 84, in 2020. https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sandiegouniontribune/name/marvin-carpenter-obituary?id=37288080 

It seems from his obituary he was a decent guy. He was probably the owner or manager of this business. It is currently called U-Stor-It but it was still called Import Storage in 2019. It seems from the Google reviews that it went downhill fast after he passed and is now closed. ""Owner likes to talk a lot"" (but a positive review!) 8 years ago. A shame.

The hotel is currently called Timhotel Gare du Nord. Going back to 2008 it was the Kyrios. I can't find when it was the Nord Hotel. 

The Abbey Bookshop opened in 1989.

So...in my head someone bought this book, read it once and put it on their bookshelf. Maybe around 1990 they passed it to their adult son who was packing for a holiday in France. He arrives at the Gare du Nord and decides to get a bite to eat, pulling out his book. 

It's quite busy and Marvin can't find his own table. He asks if he can sit and the man agrees. Marvin is a friendly guy and they talk about this and that. Marvin has a storage business on the southern US border near the Port of San Diego. That's interesting, the man has been thinking about moving to the US and he would need to send some goods over. Marvin fishes in his pocket for a pen and a piece of paper, finding the card his hotel gave him when he checked in. 

Marvin says his goodbyes and the man returns to his book. After he has finished his coffee, he inserts the card Marvin gave him as a bookmark. 

Later, he will curse as he realises he has left the book, 13/14 chapters read, in his hotel room. Also the card left by that nice man from the train station cafe. 

The maid cleans the room and knocks the book onto the floor she has mopped. Whoops. She picks it up and puts it in the lost property box at reception. A month later, along with a few other books, it's donated to the new secondhand bookstore one of the staff knows. 

There is sits on the shelf. A little tatty, a little water-damaged, every now and again it is pulled from the shelf and put back as browsers settle on thicker or more exciting-looking books. 

Years pass. Someone who loves an old SciFi paperback comes looking and is drawn to this one...briefly he puts it back and picks up a Ben Bova novel...but no...this one.

the stork delivers babies to some

sugar pills to others 

 

Both get the tender breasts

the nausea

the first trimester exhaustion

the bubble of joy imagining an addition to the family

how your spouse will be as a parent

the creative plans for a new nursery

 

But one gets the two lines

the other wipes blood spilled from an empty womb 

 

One gets an ultrasound

the other a forlorn soul soaked in wet grief

 

But maybe next month

the stork will realize you’ve already had a lifetime’s worth of sugar pills

and they’re starting to taste bitter 

 

Because they don’t have that sweet newborn smell 

they don’t grow into a mini version of the person you love most 

they can’t go on play dates with their grandparents

who would love them to the ends of the earth

but are walking on borrowed time

 

Maybe next month 

the stork will realize you’re sugar sick

and he’ll bring you a seed to grow instead 

and the sugar pills will somehow feel worth it

Okay so review time. First on the list is Angry Monkei Lacson.

SERVICE
The barrista was very chatty pagabot ko (maybe kay ara ang bosses nila 😅). Ako lang only customer pagabot ko around 12 noon-ish and very explain gid siya sakon ano ila bestsellers, which is appreciated. May oat milk sila, which is great as a lactose intolerant pero wala siya naka indicate sa menu nila so I had to ask. 

THE MATCHA
First comment is medjo sa more mahal range siya. 185 ang base price sang iced nila, wala ko idea how much ang oat milk add on nila. First impression ko was that it was chalky, first sip ko after stirring was solid pieces of matcha, which wasn't great. Initially, it tasted light pero ginsuper mix ko siya liwat because I guess the matcha settled sa bottom, and naging stronger siya. I forgot to ask the barrista kung ano nga brand ila matcha, pero to me it tasted ceremonial-grade like the ones I often drink sa Japan and Manila. It's on the more heavier side flavor profile wise, and it had the mouthfeel of coffee (I have no clue why kay indi man dirty matcha order ko, basi sa brand of matcha nga gina use nila).

THE FOOD
Mahal. 2 piece pancake with bacon nila 300+. Sure, the pancake was good kay it's not pancake mix and tasted like it was made in-house. Indi fluffy, a bit firm nga daw cake ang mouthfeel (wow twice na ko naghambal mouthfeel in one post 😭). Namit ila bacon though, just the right amount of crispy and on the saltier side siya, na balance ang sweetness sang pancakes.

OVERALL VERDICT
Okay siya nga place. Chill ang vibe, I really like their interior decoration. Amo lang na galing, on the pricier side so I most likely won't be coming back. But if you're looking for heavier matcha than your usual sweet matcha, Angry Monkei would be a good choice. Just request siguro sa barrista to whisk it well 😅

Amo lang na. Salamat sa pagbasa. Sa next naman 🫶🏽",6,1756200855.0,Bacolod,2,0.88,False

A well-chosen dome not only enhances guest comfort but also determines your investment return and long-term operating efficiency. Whether you’re building a boutique glamping dome site or a large-scale resort, each size of dome tent serves a unique purpose.

[Glamping resort in Xinjiang, China](https://preview.redd.it/fn4q789b1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79f40c76e87242908ffbb5ba1513dc42e9ea520d)

**What Guests Expect in a** [**Dome Hotel Room**](https://www.raxtent.com/collections/glass-dome)

Before comparing dome sizes, it’s important to consider what hotel guests usually expect when staying in a glamping dome tent:

l   Comfortable sleeping space — queen/king bed with enough room to move freely.

l   Private bathroom — ideally with a shower and toilet inside the dome.

l   Lounge or leisure area — sofa, coffee table, or even a dining set.

l   Climate control — air conditioning and heating for all-season comfort.

l   Privacy & views — blackout curtains while still offering panoramic stargazing.

Optional kitchen or bar — for long stays or luxury experiences.

With these essentials in mind, let’s explore the most common dome sizes: 5m, 6m, 7m, and 8m.

**5m Glass Geodesic Dome (20㎡) – Cozy & Compact**

[5m glass dome tent in Canada](https://preview.redd.it/95pc17td1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01d27b422424c5bcc38df9f6d53736573d80bc34)

The [5m glass dome tent ](https://www.raxtent.com/products/5m-winter-glass-dome-tent-with-good-thermal-insulation-in-canada)is designed for solo travelers or couples seeking a short getaway. With a floor area of 20㎡, this compact dome comfortably fits:

l   One queen-size bed (or two singles)

l   A small seating area or coffee corner.

l   Storage or compact wardrobe.

[5m glamping dome hotel](https://preview.redd.it/uze0yile1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97986a4a359904829a12365a17d2448b04c3e3a0)

Hotels often use 5m domes as entry-level dome tents or for budget-friendly stays. Due to limited space, bathrooms are usually shared or installed as modular units outside. Guests enjoy the intimate and cozy atmosphere, making it ideal for quick glamping trips or romantic weekends.

**6m Glass Dome Tent (28㎡) – Standard Hotel Room Alternative**

[6m glass dome tent in Serbia](https://preview.redd.it/zepzo3nf1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08c018707eeabc19ab0a0adadba6cf32d12e783a)

The [6m geodesic dome](https://www.raxtent.com/products/raxtent-6m-crystal-glass-glamping-igloo-dome-tent-for-camping-resorts) is one of the most popular choices for dome hotels, offering 28㎡ of usable space. It balances cost and comfort, creating a space equivalent to a standard boutique hotel room. Inside, operators can include:

l   A queen or king-size bed.

l   A private bathroom with toilet and shower.

l   A small sofa or lounge corner

[6m glamping dome hotel with bathroom](https://preview.redd.it/fih22ssg1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b5a1b628857e98ef8fc3c32b6c0855043678259)

This dome size works perfectly for couples, business travelers, or weekend escapes. For glamping resorts, the 6m dome tent delivers one of the best returns on investment, as it offers a comfortable stay without the higher costs of larger domes.

**7m Glass Dome Tent (39㎡) – Family & Group Stay**

[7m glass dome tent in Canada](https://preview.redd.it/cka7xfsh1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5ea26e09b5ea24dbd1e8e139b63169ae57df8a9)

At 39㎡, the [7m glass dome house](https://www.raxtent.com/products/7m-glass-geodesic-dome-house-for-airbnb-glamping-hotel) offers significantly more flexibility and is perfect for families or small groups. In addition to a king-size bed, you can design the interior with:

l   One or two extra single beds (or bunk beds)

l   A larger bathroom with enclosed shower.

l   A lounge or mini dining area.

l   Even a mini kitchen, perfect for long-stay guests.

[7m glamping dome with bathroom and kitchen](https://preview.redd.it/a9olaomi1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abca5d45b3aca68e8644c8de1adda322ceb6bd5b)

The 7m dome is a great choice for family-friendly resorts or eco-hotels that want to host multiple guests in one unit. The extra space means higher guest satisfaction and longer booking durations.

**8m Glass Dome Tent (50㎡) – Luxury Suite Experience**

[8m glass dome tent in Mexico](https://preview.redd.it/0b1md7rj1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e78787db251913d951a811073dfd2eea477e9da7)

The[ 8m glass geodesic dome](https://www.raxtent.com/products/raxtent-8m-glass-geo-dome-stay-for-glamping-tiny-home-in-desert-camp) tent transforms into a luxury suite with an impressive 50㎡ of floor space. This size allows for premium layouts such as:

l   A master king bedroom with lounge seating.

l   A spacious bathroom with separate shower and bathtub.

l   A mini bar or full kitchen.

l   Even a two-bedroom layout, perfect for luxury families.

[8m honeycomb dom ehotel in Phillippines](https://preview.redd.it/pcfm1z1l1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed782c975c3259e9328764e7fa92a6312db133a9)

Guests in this dome category are usually honeymooners, long-stay eco-travelers, or high-end customers seeking something unique. For hotels, the 8m dome tent can act as a signature glamping dome villa, charging higher rates and becoming the highlight of your property.

**Real-World Example: Clear Sky Resort (USA)**

One of the most famous dome resorts in North America, [Clear Sky Resort](https://brycecanyon.clearskyresorts.com/), showcases the potential of customizing dome tents for different functions. They selected 7.2m, 8.5m, 10m, 12m, 15m, and even 20m domes, each tailored to specific needs:

l   7.2m domes – luxury family units.

l   8.5m domes – premium suites with mezzanine.

l   10m domes – group accommodations.

l   12m -15m–20m domes – used as reception halls, lounges, and event spaces.

[Clear Sky Resorts, Utah, USA](https://preview.redd.it/ov4w1htm1clf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4356f2cf2ae10719727f7dbe8f26c7f17a8a0be2)

This case demonstrates how flexible the geodesic dome tent can be — from intimate rooms to large-scale event halls. Of course, larger and custom domes come at a higher investment, but they provide the opportunity to diversify your offerings and attract more customers.

**Dome Size Comparison Table**

||
||
|**Dome Size**|**Area (㎡)**|**Suitable Guests**|**Typical Layout**|**Key Advantage**|**Limitation**|
|**5m**|20㎡|Solo travelers, couples|Bed + small seating|Cost-effective, cozy|No private bathroom inside|
|**6m**|28㎡|Couples, business|Bed + compact bathroom + sofa|Best ROI, standard hotel feel|Less ideal for families|
|**7m**|39㎡|Families, small groups|Bed(s) + full bathroom + lounge + mini kitchen|Family-friendly, long stays|Slightly higher cost|
|**8m**|50㎡|Luxury travelers|King bed + large bathroom + lounge + kitchen|Premium suite, 2-bedroom option|Higher investment & upkeep|

Choosing the right dome size depends on your target audience and investment strategy. For most hotel operators, 6m and 7m domes are the most versatile and profitable. If you want to stand out, adding a few 8m domes as luxury suites can significantly increase your brand value.

**The Verdict:**  
The Chunichi Dragons (-1.5, 2.6) are the chalk here, and with good reason—they’re priced at a sharp **1.56** (64.1% implied) on the moneyline, while the Yakult Swallows (+2.0) are the underdog with a 50% implied chance.

The total is set at **4.5 runs** (Over: 2.0, Under: 1.71–1.91), so strap in for a pitcher’s duel that’ll make you question why you’re still watching.

**Why Chunichi?**

Not in the movie kind with fireworks and last-minute airport chases (though I wouldn’t say no to that either 😅), but in the slow, grounded kind - the kind where someone remembers how you take your coffee, texts back without games, and actually wants to know how your day went. I’ve been ghosted, breadcrumbed, slow-faded, over-promised and under-delivered. I’ve had someone cry during a breakup because they felt bad. I’ve also been the one who disappeared when it got real. I’ve made mistakes, learned from them, healed a little, hurt a little more, and somehow… I still open dating apps. A few months ago I downloaded Hily app on a random Tuesday night - no expectations, just curiosity. I’d never tried it before. The UI was fine, the profiles looked normal, and surprisingly, I had a long, honest convo with someone about grief and road trips. It didn’t turn into love, but it reminded me I’m not the only one trying. I think that’s why I keep showing up. Because I know people are out there - people who also believe in something more than hookups or power plays. People who don’t think “over thirty” means “expired.” People who still want to build something real, even if it takes a while..

hey everyone, so i know we all feel it, denver is not cheap to live in. that awesome mountain view comes with a price tag, and honestly, my regular job wasn't cutting it. i started looking into online side hustles a couple years ago and found some stuff that actually works from right here in the city. thought i'd share what i've learned. hope this helps someone out.  
  
1. local niche e-commerce. bet you didn't think of this one. instead of just random dropshipping, i'm talking about selling denver-specific stuff online. think about it... curating and selling subscription boxes with local goods from businesses on south broadway or in RiNo. or what about an online store for high-end dog hiking gear? everyone here has a dog and loves to hike. you can run the whole thing from your apartment. pretty decent money in it if you find the right niche.  
  
2. managing airbnb ""experiences"" online. everyone talks about managing airbnb properties, but that's a ton of work. what you can do instead is find a local expert—like a craft brewer who could host a tasting, or an artist in the Art District on Santa Fe—and you manage their online presence. you handle the booking page, the messages, the marketing, all from your laptop, and just take a cut. it's all online coordination with no cleanup.  
  
3. Prked parking spot manager. not gonna lie, this one is gold, especially if you own a place with a driveway or garage. parking in this city is a nightmare. you can list your empty parking space on an app like Prked and basically manage it online for semi-passive income. if you live anywhere near empower field or ball arena, you can make cash on game days with short-term rentals. but honestly, the real move is monthly parking. tons of people in cap hill, baker, or lohi would kill for a dedicated monthly spot. you just manage the listing online from your couch. its a super underrated way to make extra money in denver.  
  
4. cannabis industry social media ghostwriter. this is super denver-specific. dispensaries and cbd companies have really strict rules about how they can advertise. a lot of them need help creating content for their blogs or social media that's informative but doesn't violate any regulations. if you're a decent writer, you can specialize in this and do it all remotely for denver-based companies.  
  
5. remote itinerary planner. with so many people moving here or visiting for the weekend, you can sell custom itineraries online. someone tells you they love breweries, hiking, and live music, and you create a detailed 3-day plan for them as a pdf. you can charge like 50-100 bucks a pop for something that might take you an hour to map out.  
  
6. AI automation consultant for small businesses. denver has a huge tech scene, but most small businesses aren't using tech well. learn some basic AI tools for customer service bots or social media automation and pitch it to local breweries, coffee shops, or stores. you can set it all up remotely and charge a fee to help them save time.  
  
7. drone pilot for real estate. if you have a drone, get your FAA certification online. real estate agents in pricey neighborhoods like cherry creek or the highlands pay good money for aerial footage of their listings. you can market your services on instagram or linkedin and just send them the files digitally.  
  
8. online tutor for tech skills. instead of tutoring math or english, focus on the skills people need for denver's job market. tons of people are going through coding bootcamps or trying to switch into a tech career. if you know any of that stuff, you can tutor them over zoom.  
  
9. freelance grant writer. we have a ton of non-profits in denver. many of them can't afford to hire a full-time staffer to write grants. if you have strong writing and research skills, you can do this from home on a contract basis. it pays really well.  
  
10. the obvious stuff. and yeah, there's always the typical stuff like being a virtual assistant for a startup, freelance writing, or transcription. there are a lot of tech companies here, so finding remote VA work is definitely possible and can be a steady way to bring in an extra thousand a month.  
  
anyway, the cost of living here is rough, but there are definitely ways to use the internet to your advantage. hope this helps give you some ideas.",1,1756200269.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

1n0h2p0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1n0h2p0/claude_code_switching_to_gpt5pro_repoprompt_codex/,Claude Code --> switching to GPT5-Pro + Repoprompt + Codex CLI,"So this isn't -perfect- and Claude Code still has a lot of usability advantages and QoL stuff that's just plain awkward in Codex CLI, but, is that worth a full Claude plan? I've been practicing using the following flow and it's working better and better. Not perfect, but if OpenAI catch up on some CC features it will get there >>

\#1 - Using GPT-5 Pro as Orchestrator/Assessor (using Repoprompt to package up) -- requires reduction in codebase size and better organisation to work well, but that's good! --->  
I used RepoPrompt a lot in the Gemini 2.5 Pro dominance era to package up my whole codebase for analysis, but i'm finding it useful now to debug or improve code quality to package up relevant parts of the code and send to GPT5-Pro instead. It has a limit of somewhere between 64KB-69KB that the window will tolerate in web view that I hope they increase, but this has actually led to an improvement in some of my code quality over time -- it's given me a reason to spend time working to reduce the amount of code while retaining UX/functionality, and increase the readability of the code in the process. I'm now purposefully trying to get key separate concerns in my codebase to fit within this amount in order to help with prompting, and it's led to a lot of improvements in the process. 

\#2 - GPT5-Pro to solve bugs and problems other things can't  --->  
Opus 4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, regular GPT models, Claude Code, Codex CLI -- all of them get stuck on certain issues that GPT5-Pro solves completely and incisively. I wouldn't use GPT5-Pro for quick experiments or for the mid-point of creating certain features, but to assess the groundwork for a plan or to check in on why something is hard to fix, GPT5-Pro spends a few minutes doing it while you grab a cup of coffee and its solution is usually correct (or at least, even in the rare instances it's not the complete story, it rarely hurts, which is more than can be said for some Claude fixes). I've been using it for very deliberate foundational refactoring on a project to make sure everything's good before I continue. 

\#3 - Main reason I'm enjoying Codex -- it doesn't do the wackily unnecessary list of 'enhancements' that Claude spews out --->  
I loved Claude Code for the longest time, but why the hell was it trying to put half the crap in that it was trying to put in without asking?? Codex is far less nuts in its behaviour. If I were Anthropic ,that's something I'd try and tweak, or at least give us some control over. 

\#4 - The way to run Codex -->   
codex --config model\_reasoning\_effort=""high""  
That will get you the best model if you're on the Pro Plan, and I've not encountered a single rate limit. No doubt they'll enshittify it at some point, but I'm fairly flexible about jumping between the three major AI tools based on their development so, we'll see!

\#5 - Using the rest of the GPT5-Pro context window when done -->  
If you're keeping a lot of your requests below 65KB ish, when you're done with all the changes, get Codex to create a mini list of files altered and what was altered and why etc, especially any discrepancies vs the original plan. Then, copy that into Repoprompt and send a query through to the same Pro chat, asking --- ""The codebase has now been altered with the following change notes. Please assess whether the new set of files is as you expected it to be, and give any guidance for further adjustments and tweaks as needed"". If you're low on context or want a greater focus, you can just do the actual changed files (if you committed prior to the changes, repoprompt even lets you include the git diffs and their files alone). Now, sometimes Pro gets slightly caught up on thinking it has to say stuff here for suggestions just so it felt like it did its job and is a good boy, etc, but often it will catch some small elements that the codex implementations missed or got wrong, and you just paste that back through to Codex.

\#6 - when relaying between agents such as Codex and the main GPT-5 pro (or indeed, any multi-llm stuff), I still use tags like -- <AGENT></AGENT> or <PROPOSAL></PROPOSAL> -- i.e. 'Another agent has given the following proposals for X Y Z features. Trace the relevant code and read particularly affected files in full, make sure you understand what it is asking for, and then outline your plan for implementation -- <PROPOSAL>copied-text-from-gpt-5-pro-here</PROPOSAL>' -- I have no idea how useful this is, but I think as those messages can be quite long and agents prone to confusion, it helps just make that crystal clear. 

  
Anyway, I hope the above is of some use to people, and if you have any of your own recommendations for such a flow, let me know!

I’m a university student, and while walking with my friends down the hall, I saw a very pretty woman.

Now, I’m from the Philippines, which is a bit of a traditional country (not sure if that matters much here), but I feel like approaching women might be slightly different compared to the West.

I know the usual advice is “just go up and make conversation,” but my problem is: how exactly do I start that conversation? What do I even talk about so it doesn’t feel weird or forced?

And if things go well, how do I naturally transition into asking her out on a date (coffee, lunch, etc.) without making it seem like I’m rushing?

Any advice, especially from people with experience approaching women in a university setting, would be really appreciated

['Bobby's Triple Threat': New Titan Ayesha Nurdjaja on How Bobby Flay Shocked Her & 'Intense' Season 4](https://www.tvinsider.com/1209751/bobbys-triple-threat-season-4-ayesha-nurdjaja-titan-flay-food-network-show/)

Here is an excerpt but click the link for the whole story:

**How did this opportunity to be a “titan” this season come about? What was the process?**

**Ayesha Nurdjaja:** I was literally at the gym with my trainer, and I looked over to my phone, which I never do. It said Bobby Flay across the screen. I was like, “I have to take this.” I was on the phone with him. He asked to meet face-to-face, maybe for coffee. I said, “One hundred percent.” We met at Shuka. He got to telling me about the show. I thought, “That’s awesome. Good for you.” Then he asked me to be a titan, and I think my jaw hit the floor. I was like, “You’re nuts. Are you trying to punk me?” When he asked why, I said, “Competition wasn’t really my realm. Although it’s a television show, you still want to win and surround yourself with others who have this experience.” He was like, “You have it.” I asked him to let me think about it. I thought about it, and told him the only way I’d do it is if he trained me. So, he took days out of his busy schedule to meet at the Food Network kitchen to work with me. That is truly how it unfolded. 

**You were a judge on Season 2. Did that help you at all?** 

I judged a lot of television cooking shows, and that was the hardest judging job I’ve ever had. I think I probably took the longest and held back production. Because the food was so amazing, it was really difficult to find flaws. It didn’t help being a judge. It’s like two different animals. It’s like learning how to walk and running a marathon. 

**What was entailed with those training sessions?** 

Bobby walked around in his chef’s coat while I was cooking. We did a lot of mock competitions. He gave me two ingredients and said to just cook. Some of it was timed and other parts were untimed. He would basically just walk around and ask me why I was doing a particular thing. I’d give him my process. He would say, “That’s cool if you were working in a restaurant, but on the show you have to think about the timing, all of these small details and elements that go into it.” Knowing how to cook, obviously, you need that to get on the show. Also, knowing how to cook within 45 minutes to do the dishes with judging expectation at the forefront. You also have to make sure you’re putting out dishes that highlight the ingredients. It’s kind of like alchemy in that there is a lot that goes into it. Just knowing how to cook isn’t enough. That I’ll tell you. 

**How was it getting to know Michael and Brooke?** 

It was awesome. Before we started, they called me over the telephone to congratulate me. They were very welcoming. I had a lot of questions. I asked things that may be considered silly like what was their day like, or how did you get to this point? Or when you see two ingredients, how do the ideas come to you? Some of the questions they couldn’t answer because you have to experience it on your own. Bobby kept telling me through the process that whatever you’re learning is so hard, but in the moment, you’re going to get it.

I’d say it wasn’t until that first episode that I understood what he said. There was still a learning curve. Michael and Brooke are intense. They want to win and have been competing for many years. On one end you want to say they have it down to a science. On the other hand it’s very nerve-wracking for someone as a first-timer and someone who is a veteran because when you step into that type of arena it’s any two ingredients. Sometimes the more familiar you are with the ingredients the more difficult it is because you have so many ideas. Other times you’re completely blank and you’re looking at these two ingredients having no idea what you’re going to make. ",6,1756199596.0,foodnetwork,1,0.88,False

So, I recently dove into Ann Cleeves' *Silent Voices*, and I've been really wanting to chat about it. If you're looking for a gripping read that keeps you thinking long after you've turned the last page, you might want to check it out. For those curious, you can find a copy right here: [Silent Voices - Ann Cleeves](https://pdfhive.com/silent-voices-ann-cleeves/).

### My Thoughts on *Silent Voices*

Okay, first things first, let's do a quick, spoiler-free rundown. *Silent Voices* is one of Ann Cleeves' Vera Stanhope mysteries, and it kicks off when Vera, our wonderfully unconventional detective, finds a dead woman in a sauna. This isn't just any woman; she's a social worker who seems to have been living a perfectly normal life, but as Vera digs deeper, the layers of secrets start peeling away. It's a classic whodunit, but it's more about the 'why' and the complex human stories behind the crime.

**What I Really Liked:**

*   **Vera Stanhope:** Honestly, Vera is one of the best characters in crime fiction. She's not your typical slick, polished detective. She's a bit dishevelled, sharp as a tack, and has this incredible empathy that allows her to understand the darker corners of human nature. Her deductions often come from a place of understanding people, not just evidence, and that's refreshing.
*   **The Atmosphere:** Ann Cleeves is brilliant at creating a sense of place. Even though this book isn't set in the really wild, remote areas sometimes featured in her other books, the suburban setting still feels incredibly real and, at times, quite chilling. You get a strong sense of the community, its secrets, and the underlying tension.
*   **Pacing and Storytelling:** Now, if you like lightning-fast action, this might not be your speed. Cleeves builds her stories slowly and meticulously, like a puzzle coming together piece by piece. I found myself completely engrossed in the gradual unfolding of the mystery. It's not about big explosions; it's about subtle psychological tension and character depth.
*   **Emotional Depth:** The book really explores themes of loneliness, secrets, and the impact of past events on the present. You feel for the characters, even the ones who are entangled in the crime, and it makes the mystery feel more meaningful than just a simple puzzle.

**What Might Not Be For Everyone (or what I found less ""gripping"" in a fast-paced way):**

*   **Pacing:** As I mentioned, it's a slow burn. If you prefer high-octane thrillers where something dramatic happens every few pages, this might feel a little too gentle at times. But for me, that's part of its charm – it allows you to really sink into the story.
*   **Complexity of Characters:** While Vera is fantastic, some of the secondary characters, while integral to the plot, felt a little less developed than I might have liked. However, this is a minor point, as their roles serve the mystery well.

**Would I Recommend It?**

Absolutely! If you enjoy character-driven mysteries, psychological fiction, or just a really well-crafted story that makes you think, then yes, pick this one up. It's perfect for a cozy afternoon read, or if you're looking for something to slowly unravel over a few days.

### A Little Guide for New Readers!

If you're just getting into reading, especially genres like thrillers, psychological fiction, or even fantasy, it can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming to pick a book or even get into the habit. Here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Start with what excites you:** Don't force yourself to read something just because it's popular or ""classic."" If a fantasy world with dragons sounds amazing, go for it! If a gritty detective story like Vera's piques your interest, dive in. Your first few books should be about fun and discovery.
2.  **It's okay to put a book down:** If you're not enjoying a book, seriously, don't feel bad about not finishing it. There are millions of books out there. Life's too short to read something you're not connecting with.
3.  **Read in small bursts:** You don't need to dedicate hours at a time. Ten or fifteen minutes before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee can make a huge difference. Small, consistent steps build a habit.
4.  **Find a community (like this one!):** Talking about books with others can make the experience so much richer. You get new perspectives, discover new authors, and it makes reading a shared adventure.
5.  **Personal Tip:** Don't worry about understanding every single detail or remembering every character name, especially in complex fantasy or thriller plots. Just let the story wash over you. If something's important, it'll usually come back around. The goal is enjoyment, not an exam!
6.  **Motivational Advice:** Reading is a journey of exploration. Every book is a new world, a new set of characters, a new adventure waiting to happen. Embrace the wonder, let your imagination run wild, and enjoy the escape!

So, whether you're a seasoned reader or just starting out, I hope this helps you find your next great read. Happy reading, everyone!

1n0gqjv,https://youtu.be/hmhA-HW1vM4,4 Very Scary TRUE Vacation Rental Horror Stories,"# ""The Cabin Host"":

I had been looking forward to this little escape for weeks. My two young kids, Emma and Jack, needed a break from the city noise, and I found this cozy cabin online through a rental site. It was tucked away in a quiet forested area, far from everything, with no neighbors for miles and spotty cell service. The listing promised peace and relaxation, perfect for a single mom like me trying to unwind. The host, a man named Robert, seemed friendly in his messages, giving clear directions on how to get there and where to find the key under the mat.

When we arrived in the afternoon, the place looked just like the photos—wooden walls, a small kitchen, one bedroom for me and a loft for the kids. Emma, who is eight, ran straight to the loft, giggling as she climbed the ladder. ""Mom, this is like a treehouse!"" she said. Jack, five years old, clung to my leg at first, but soon he was exploring the living room, poking at the old fireplace. I unpacked our bags and made sandwiches for dinner. Robert had left a note on the counter: ""Welcome! Make yourselves at home. If you need anything, my number is here. I'm just a short drive away."" I texted him to say we had settled in, and he replied quickly: ""Great to hear. Enjoy your stay.""

The first evening went smoothly. We played board games by the lamp light, and the kids fell asleep easily after their baths. I sat on the couch with a book, feeling the quiet wrap around me like a blanket. No cars honking, no sirens—just the occasional rustle outside that I figured was wildlife. I locked the door before bed, double-checking the windows too. It felt safe enough.

The next morning, we hiked a short trail nearby. The kids collected sticks and leaves, chattering the whole time. ""Look at this one, Mom! It's shaped like a sword,"" Jack said, waving a branch. Emma added, ""Can we make s'mores tonight?"" I promised we would. Back at the cabin, I started dinner early—pasta on the stove—while they drew pictures at the table. That's when I heard the door creak open. No knock, no call out. I turned, expecting maybe a delivery or something, but there stood Robert, stepping inside like he owned the place. Well, he did, but still.

""Oh, hi there,"" he said, smiling a bit too wide. He was taller than I expected, with graying hair and work boots caked in mud. ""Just checking if everything's okay. Water pressure good? Heat working?""

I nodded, stirring the pot to hide my surprise. ""Yes, all fine. Thanks for stopping by."" The kids looked up, curious but not scared. Emma waved. ""Hi! We're making art.""

Robert chuckled and walked further in, glancing around. ""Cute kids. You all alone out here?"" His eyes lingered on our things—my purse on the chair, the kids' toys scattered. It felt odd, him asking that. I said, ""Yes, just us for the weekend."" He nodded slowly, then mentioned something about the fireplace needing fresh wood and offered to bring some later. I thanked him politely, hoping he'd leave. After a few more minutes of small talk, he did, saying, ""Call if you need me.""

That visit unsettled me a little. Why no warning? But I brushed it off as him being overly helpful. We ate dinner, made those s'mores over the fire, and the kids begged for stories. I told them a fun one about animals in the woods, keeping it light. As night fell, I tucked them in upstairs and came down to clean up. The cabin felt bigger in the dark, with only the hum of the fridge breaking the silence. I checked my phone—no bars, as expected. I locked up again and went to bed, but sleep came slow. Every little creak made me pause.

Hours later, deep into the night, I woke to a sound. The front door handle jiggling, then the click of it opening. My eyes snapped wide. Footsteps shuffled in the living room—soft, deliberate. Not the kids; they were asleep above me. I sat up quietly, listening. Someone was moving around down there, opening a drawer maybe, or shifting things. Panic rose in my throat. I slipped out of bed, barefoot on the cold floor, and grabbed the heavy flashlight from the nightstand. It was the only thing close to a weapon.

""Who's there?"" I called out, my voice steadier than I felt. The sounds stopped. Then a man's voice, low and unfamiliar: ""Just checking something. Go back to sleep."" It wasn't Robert. This voice was rougher, deeper. My mind raced—who was this? A friend of the host? A stranger? I crept to the bedroom door, peering out. In the dim light from the window, I saw a figure—a man in a dark jacket, rummaging through the kitchen cabinets. He hadn't seen me yet.

""I said, who's there? You need to leave now!"" I shouted louder, flipping on the flashlight to shine it at him. He turned, shielding his eyes. He was older, bearded, not Robert. ""Hey, easy,"" he said, raising a hand. ""Robert sent me. Said the place might need a look-over. Pipe issue or something."" But his eyes darted, and he didn't move toward the door. Upstairs, I heard Emma stir. ""Mom?"" she whispered from the loft.

""Stay up there, honey,"" I said firmly, not taking my eyes off the man. He took a step closer. ""No need to worry. I'm just doing a favor."" But why at this hour? Why no call? I backed up, gripping the flashlight like a club. ""Get out, or I'll call the police."" No service, but he didn't know that. He hesitated, then muttered, ""Fine, fine. No trouble."" He backed toward the door, but slowly, watching me the whole time.

As he reached the door, I heard Jack start to cry softly upstairs. The man paused, glancing up at the loft. ""Kids okay?"" he asked, almost casual. That sent a wave of dread through me. ""Leave. Now."" My tone left no room for talk. He finally stepped out, closing the door behind him. I rushed over and locked it, then pushed a chair under the knob for good measure. My hands shook as I climbed the ladder to the kids. Emma was wide-eyed. ""Who was that man, Mom?"" Jack hugged his blanket tight.

""Just someone who got the wrong place,"" I lied, pulling them close. ""It's okay now."" But it wasn't. I didn't sleep the rest of the night, sitting by the window with the flashlight on, watching the dark outside. What if he came back? What if Robert had given him a key? Why would the host let someone in like that?

At first light, I packed our bags fast. The kids asked questions as we loaded the car. ""Why are we leaving early, Mom?"" Emma said. ""I thought we had one more day."" I forced a smile. ""Something came up at home, sweetie. We'll do another trip soon."" As we drove away, I glanced back at the cabin. It looked so innocent in the daylight. I tried calling Robert once I got signal—straight to voicemail. I left a message: ""What was that last night? Some man came in saying you sent him. This isn't okay."" No reply ever came.

Later, I reported it to the rental site. They investigated and found out Robert had a history of complaints—people saying he or his ""helpers"" entered without notice, sometimes taking small things. One review mentioned a similar nighttime visit. The site removed his listing, but it didn't erase the fear. Now, whenever I think of vacation rentals, I stick to hotels. That night taught me how vulnerable you can be in someone else's space, especially when help is far away.





# ""Cabin 12"":

I was sprawled on the couch at my buddy Jake’s cabin, flipping through a comic book, when I decided it was time to head back to our rental. It was a short walk through the resort, past the flickering lights of other cabins. Jake’s mom waved me off, saying, “Be safe, Tom. Tell your dad I said hi.” I nodded, pulling my jacket tight, and started down the gravel path to Cabin 12. It was late afternoon, and I was thinking about the burgers Dad promised for dinner.

When I pushed open our door, the air felt wrong. A sharp, coppery smell hit me, like pennies left in the rain. The living room was trashed—chairs tipped over, cushions slashed. Then I saw Dad, crumpled near the coffee table, his face bloodied, arms bound with duct tape. My older brother, Luke, was slumped against the wall, his hands tied with some kind of rope, cuts all over him. Blood pooled under them both, soaking the rug. My little sister, Ellie, was nowhere.

I stumbled back, my voice caught in my throat. I ran to the neighbors, the Carters, pounding on their door. “Mr. Carter! Something’s wrong! My dad, Luke—they’re hurt bad!” Mr. Carter opened the door, his eyes widening as I stammered out what I saw. “Stay here, Tom,” he said, grabbing his phone and dialing 911. Mrs. Carter pulled me inside, her hands shaking. “You’re okay now,” she kept saying, but I could tell she didn’t believe it.

Sheriffs swarmed the resort within minutes, their radios crackling. They found my little brother, Ben, hiding in the back closet, unharmed but terrified. He was only six, clutching his stuffed dinosaur. “I heard yelling,” Ben whispered later, “but I stayed quiet like Dad always said to do if something bad happened.” The deputies asked me about the day before. I told them we’d been fishing at the lake. Dad and Luke had run into this guy, Carl, a friend of Luke’s from town. Carl had been staying at the resort, too, in a cabin nearby. Dad didn’t like him much, said he was “trouble,” but Luke shrugged it off. “He’s fine, Dad. Just likes to party,” Luke had said, laughing as they grilled steaks that night. Ellie had been playing cards with me and Ben, giggling about how she’d beat us both. I went to Jake’s after dinner, promising Dad I’d be back by morning.

The crime scene was a nightmare, the deputies said. Dad and Luke had been tied up with tape and rope from the cabin’s toolbox. Someone used a kitchen knife and a hammer—stuff probably from our own place. Blood was smeared on the walls, like someone had taken their time. Ellie was gone, no trace. I kept thinking about her big eyes, how she’d hug me when she was scared. Where was she?

The sheriff asked if we’d noticed anyone strange. I mentioned Carl, how he’d been hanging around with another guy, some drifter named Ray who showed up a week ago. They’d been loud at the resort bar, arguing with staff. Our neighbor, Mr. Walsh, had complained about them, too. “Those two were creeping around last night,” he told the sheriff. “Saw ‘em near your cabin, Tom, around midnight.”

Weeks dragged on, and fear clung to us like damp clothes. Ben and I stayed with our aunt, but I couldn’t shake the feeling someone was watching. At night, I’d hear footsteps outside, or the phone would ring with no one on the line. Ben started having nightmares, muttering, “I saw a man in the window, Tom. He had a beard.” I didn’t know if it was real or his mind playing tricks. Once, I found a cigarette butt outside our aunt’s place, same brand Carl smoked. I told the sheriff, but they had nothing solid.

They found Ellie’s jacket months later, miles away in a ditch, torn and stained. No body, just that jacket she loved with the pink flowers. I could still hear her voice, “Tom, don’t let the bad guys get me,” from when we’d play pretend. The thought of her out there, alone with whoever took her, made my chest tight.

The investigation pointed to Carl and Ray. A witness said they saw Ray’s truck speeding out of the resort that night. Carl’s girlfriend told police he came home that morning with blood on his shoes, claiming he’d “handled a problem.” Ray had a rap sheet—assault, theft—and skipped town right after. But no arrests. Evidence was too thin, they said. A knife found in the woods later matched one from Carl’s cabin, but his lawyer called it circumstantial.

Years later, they found remains in a ravine, too degraded to identify right away. DNA said it was probably Ellie. I still see her face, hear her laugh. I check every lock twice now, keep a bat by my bed. Ben doesn’t talk about it, but he jumps at loud noises. The resort’s mostly abandoned now, cabins rotting. Sometimes I drive by, wondering if Carl or Ray ever come back, watching from the trees. What if they’re still out there, waiting? The fear’s a weight I carry every day.





# ""Hidden Eyes"":

My husband Alex and I had been planning this weekend trip for months. We wanted a quiet place to relax with a few friends and their kids, away from the city noise. We found this house on Airbnb in Verona, Wisconsin, listed by a guy named Patrick. The photos showed a clean, modern home with plenty of space, two bathrooms, and a backyard for the children to play. The reviews were mostly positive, nothing that raised any flags. We booked it for July, packed our bags, and drove up on a Friday afternoon.

When we arrived, Patrick was there to greet us. He was in his early forties, tall with a neat beard, and he smiled a lot as he handed over the keys. ""Welcome,"" he said. ""I've left some snacks in the kitchen. If you need anything, just message me through the app. I'll be nearby."" His voice was calm, but he lingered a bit too long, asking questions about our group. ""How many kids? Ages?"" I told him six children in total, ranging from five to twelve, and he nodded slowly. ""Good to know. Enjoy your stay."" Then he left, but I noticed his car parked down the street for a while before it drove off.

The first evening went fine. We unpacked, made dinner, and the kids ran around laughing. Alex and I shared the master bedroom, while our friends took the other rooms. But as night fell, something felt off. The house was too quiet, the kind of quiet where every creak of the floor stands out. I brushed it away, thinking it was just new surroundings.

The next day, Saturday, we spent time exploring local spots. When we got back, one of the kids mentioned the bathrooms felt ""funny."" I asked what he meant, and he shrugged. ""The plugs look different."" I didn't think much of it then. That evening, after everyone had showered and the children were in bed, I went to use the main bathroom. I was brushing my teeth when I glanced at the outlet by the sink. There was a small hole in the plastic cover, right in the middle. It wasn't like any outlet I'd seen—too perfect, too tiny. I leaned closer, my reflection in the mirror showing my puzzled face.

""Alex,"" I called softly from the bathroom door. He was in the living room, scrolling on his phone. ""Come here a minute.""

He walked over, yawning. ""What's up?""

""Look at this outlet. See that hole? It's not normal.""

He squinted at it. ""Maybe it's for a nightlight or something. Why?""

""It bothers me. Can you unscrew it? Just to check.""

He grabbed a small screwdriver from his toolkit in the car—we always bring one for little fixes. The kids were asleep, and our friends were chatting in the kitchen. Alex loosened the screws, and the plate came off easily. Behind it, superglued to the back, was a tiny camera. It had a lens poking through where the hole was, and wires connecting to the outlet's power. There was even a small SD card slot.

My hands went cold. ""Is that... a camera?""

Alex's face paled. He poked at it gently. ""Yeah. It's pointed right at the sink and toilet. Wait, let's check the shower side.""

We looked, and sure enough, the angle covered the whole area—the toilet, the shower stall. Anyone using the bathroom would be recorded.

""Who puts a camera in a bathroom?"" I whispered, my voice shaking. ""The host? Patrick?""

Alex nodded grimly. ""Has to be. We need to check the other bathroom.""

We crept to the second bathroom quietly, not wanting to wake anyone yet. Same thing: another outlet with a pinhole, another hidden camera glued in place, aimed at the toilet and shower. Both had SD cards.

Our friends heard us moving and came over. ""What's going on?"" one asked.

I showed them. ""Cameras. Hidden in the outlets.""

Their eyes widened. ""You're kidding. The kids have been using these all day.""

We all stood there, staring. The realization hit hard—eleven of us, including the children, had been in those bathrooms multiple times. Changing clothes, showering, everything.

""Message the host,"" Alex said. ""See what he says.""

I opened the Airbnb app on my phone, my fingers trembling. ""We found hidden cameras in both bathrooms. What is this? We're calling the police.""

I hit send. We waited, the group huddled in the hallway. Minutes passed. Then a reply came: ""That's not possible. Must be a mistake. I'm coming over to check.""

""No,"" I typed back quickly. ""Don't come. We're handling it.""

But he responded: ""On my way. Need to see for myself.""

Panic set in. ""He's coming here,"" I said. ""Now.""

Alex grabbed his phone. ""I'm calling the cops.""

He dialed 911, explaining the situation. ""We found hidden cameras in the Airbnb we're renting. In the bathrooms. The host is on his way over. Please send someone.""

The dispatcher asked for the address—Ashworth Drive—and said officers were en route. ""Stay calm, lock the doors, don't let anyone in.""

We locked every door and window, turned on all the lights. The kids woke up from the commotion, confused and scared. ""What's wrong?"" one asked.

""Nothing, sweetie,"" I said, hugging her. ""Just a mix-up. Go back to bed.""

But inside, my mind raced. What if Patrick had been watching us the whole time? The cameras were powered, SD cards ready to store whatever they captured. Had he seen the children? Us? And now he was coming, probably to remove evidence or worse.

We gathered in the living room, away from the bathrooms. Every sound outside made us jump—a car passing, wind rustling leaves. Then, headlights flashed in the driveway. A car door slammed.

""That's him,"" Alex whispered.

A knock on the door. ""It's Patrick! Open up!""

We stayed silent. Another knock, louder. ""I know you're in there. Let me explain!""

Our friend whispered, ""What if he has a key?""

I hadn't thought of that. Hosts often do. We pushed a chair against the door, but it felt useless.

The knocking stopped. Then, footsteps around the side of the house. Was he trying a window? We heard a faint rattle at the back door.

""Police are coming,"" Alex said into his phone, still on with the dispatcher. ""He's trying to get in.""

The dispatcher replied, ""Officers are two minutes away. Stay on the line.""

Those two minutes dragged on forever. We held our breath, listening. The back door handle jiggled again. Then, silence.

Sirens approached. Blue and red lights filled the windows. Footsteps retreated, a car engine started, and tires squealed away.

The police knocked. ""Madison PD! Open up!""

We let them in, showed the outlets. They removed the cameras, confirmed they were real, with SD cards full of footage. They took statements from all of us, promised to analyze everything. ""We'll track him down,"" one officer said. ""This is serious—potential recordings of minors.""

Airbnb messaged us soon after, apologizing, refunding everything, and offering to move us to a hotel. They suspended Patrick's account right away.

We packed and left that night, driving to the hotel in stunned silence. The officers caught Patrick later; he claimed the cameras were for ""security,"" but the charges came quick—invasion of privacy. He's out on bond now, but can't rent to anyone, and court is set for September.

Even now, weeks later, I check every outlet in any place we stay. That feeling of being watched, exposed—it doesn't go away easy. What started as a simple weekend turned into something I'll always remember, a reminder that sometimes the danger is hidden right in plain sight.





# ""The Last Night"":

My sister-in-law Carla and I had planned this trip to Costa Rica for months. It was her thirty-sixth birthday, and we wanted something fun, a break from our busy lives back home. We booked a villa through Airbnb in San Jose, called Villa Le Mas. The pictures online showed a nice place with a pool and views of the hills. When we arrived on November 22, 2018, the owner greeted us at the gate. He seemed polite, handed over the keys, and pointed out where everything was. The villa had two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a small patio. But right away, I noticed the security guard's apartment was attached to our building, just a thin wall away. His name was Bismarck, a tall man with a quiet stare. He nodded hello but didn't say much.

We spent the first few days exploring. We went zip-lining, visited volcanoes, and ate fresh fruit from markets. Carla was full of energy, laughing at everything. One evening, as we sat on the patio with drinks, she said, ""This is perfect, Laura. No work, no stress. Just us."" I agreed, but I couldn't shake a small unease. The villa felt isolated, even though it was in a suburb. At night, sounds carried strangely—branches scraping windows, distant dogs barking. And Bismarck was always around, walking the grounds with a flashlight, checking locks.

On November 27, the day before her birthday, we celebrated early because I had to fly home the next morning for work. Carla's flight was a day later, so she decided to stay one more night alone. ""I'll be fine,"" she told me over dinner. ""I'll just relax by the pool and catch my plane early."" I hugged her goodbye at the airport shuttle, but as I left, I glanced back at the villa. Bismarck stood at the gate, watching us. His eyes followed the car until we turned the corner.

Back home in Florida, I texted Carla as soon as I landed. ""Made it safe. How's the villa without me?"" She replied quickly: ""Quiet. Power went out for a bit, but it's back. The guard asked if I wanted to go for drinks. I said no thanks."" I frowned at my phone. ""That's weird. Be careful."" She sent back: ""It's super sketchy here now. Water sounds like someone screaming in the pipes."" Then, a minute later: ""Just kidding. All good. Talk soon.""

That was the last I heard from her. I tried calling that evening, but it went to voicemail. ""Hey, Carla, check in when you can. Miss you already."" No answer. By morning, worry set in. I messaged again: ""You okay? Flight tomorrow?"" Still nothing. I called the villa owner. ""Has Carla checked out yet?"" He sounded casual. ""No, I haven't seen her since yesterday. Maybe she went out."" I asked about Bismarck. ""He's reliable. Been here months."" But his tone didn't reassure me.

Hours passed. I paced my living room, checking my phone every minute. Carla's brother, my husband Carlos, noticed my tension. ""What's wrong?"" I explained the silence. ""She's probably just busy packing."" But deep down, I knew something felt off. We called Airbnb support. ""Our guest isn't responding. Can you contact the host?"" They promised to look into it, but hours dragged on with no update.

By evening, panic grew. Carlos and I contacted Costa Rican police through a friend who spoke Spanish. ""My sister-in-law is missing from her Airbnb villa,"" I said, my voice shaking. They took details: her description, the address, her last messages. ""We'll send officers."" Waiting was agony. I replayed our trip in my mind—the way Bismarck lingered near our door one night when we came back late. ""Need anything?"" he'd asked Carla, his smile too wide. She'd laughed it off. ""No, we're good.""

The next day, November 29, police visited the villa. They reported back: no sign of Carla. Her suitcase was still there, packed, with her passport and clothes inside. But her phone and laptop were gone. The bed looked slept in, sheets rumpled. Blood stains dotted the floor, small but fresh. My hands went cold as Carlos translated the officer's words. ""Possible struggle. We're investigating.""

News spread fast. Family gathered at our house, staring at screens for updates. I couldn't eat or sleep. Every notification made me jump. On November 30, authorities questioned Bismarck. He claimed Carla left early for a tour, but his story changed twice. ""She took a taxi,"" he said first. Then, ""A friend picked her up."" Security cameras showed nothing—no car, no departure.

Days blurred. December 1, search teams combed the woods behind the villa. I flew back to Costa Rica with Carlos and Carla's father. At the police station, an investigator showed us photos of the scene. ""We found drag marks in the dirt,"" he explained. ""Leading to the trees."" My mind raced with horrible images—Carla alone, hearing footsteps outside her door that night.

On December 3, they found her. Partially buried in plastic bags, in a shallow grave amid the leaves. Stab wounds, head trauma. The officer's face was grim as he confirmed it. ""It's her."" I collapsed into Carlos's arms, sobs choking me. Bismarck was arrested that day, charged with murder. Evidence piled up: blood in his apartment, her belongings hidden there. He confessed to attacking her after she rejected him, then hiding the body.

The trial dragged on for months. In 2019, Bismarck got sixteen years. But justice didn't erase the fear. I sued Airbnb and the villa owners with the family, arguing they failed to check his background—he wasn't even legal to work there. They settled, but money means nothing. Now, I warn everyone: check reviews, ask about security, trust your gut.

That trip started as a celebration. It ended in loss. Carla's last words echo: ""Just kidding. All good."" But it wasn't. And I'll live with that forever.",1,1756198810.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

With the official and mod release of the K36 on the horizon, this project will no longer receive updates or active support. We want to thank the RetroHandhelds community, contributors, and users for their incredible support and collaboration in making ArkOS a viable solution for these devices.

# What This Means for Users

* **No Further Updates**: The current releases (listed below) will be the final versions of ArkOS for these devices. No new features, bug fixes, or compatibility updates will be provided.
* **Archive Status**: This repository will be archived and maintained as a read-only resource for those who wish to continue using the existing firmware images or fork the project for their own purposes.
* **Existing Downloads**: The firmware images will remain available for download until further notice, but we encourage users to transition to the official K36 release or other supported firmware as they become available.
* **Community Support**: While the RetroHandhelds Discord will remain a valuable resource for general handheld emulation discussions, specific support for this project will no longer be provided. Users are welcome to share knowledge and assist each other informally.

Its been 5 years now that we've been dating after and she's come to see me as her job allows to do so and it's been 8 months since then. I haven't had a chance to go see her yet but I am in the next few days. A few days ago we had an argument and she said it was over her limit now although she also messed up. She's quite stubborn and I am as well and if I was a little forgiving I wouldn't have been in this predicament. Fast forward a day after the argument, she said ""we should stop talking"" and then she had gone out on a date after with a guy where they kissed after meeting two times. 

We didn't talk for a few days and in that time she had gone out with him a few more times but nothing more happened other than them kissing two times but what confused me is that after we started talking and agreed to video call but she had his hoodie on her. She isn't the type to lie and knowing her for 10 years she's very straight forward with things. So that's why i believe when she says that she only has kissed him and nothing more. 

Now we're talking and what she's telling me is that she's talking to him but is unsure. She's seeing where it goes and I still love her. I've conveyed all my feelings for her and apologied for my mistakes. She said she'd meet me for coffee once im in the same place but what im worried about is that if she gets involved with the guy in a more romantic way, im going to lose her for good. 

The guy is currently on vacation visiting his home town for two weeks and im only going to able to visit her after he arrives, not because that's how she wants it but because that's when I can clear things out for me and see her. Im completely moving countries and that was the whole plan in the first place, we both were looking forward for this for months and it was finally happening but now I just feel broken and confused. She's the girl for me and even though its been so many years of knowing her, everyday with her felt adventurous and she did the same. Its that once in a lifetime love and I really don't want to lose her. 

So I dont know what to do, she'll meet me for the coffee and when I tell her how I feel, she doesn't shoot me down but says idk, she'll only have an answer once we meet.

Is your bank account learning your habits faster than your best friend? Welcome to the AI revolution in banking, where your bank isn't just keeping your money safe—it's chatting with you in your native language and helping you manage your finances as seamlessly as chatting with a pal. Malaysia just took a giant leap into this brave new world with the launch of Ryt Bank, its very first AI-powered financial institution.

### The AI Advantage

AI in banking isn't just a tech upgrade; it's a paradigm shift. This tech superhero can whirl through mountains of data, calculate risks with the precision of a chess grandmaster, and tackle routine transactions with the speed of a caffeine-fueled marathon runner. And Malaysia is staking its claim on this innovative frontier with Ryt Bank, crafted through the synergy of YTL Group and Sea Limited.

### Homegrown Excellence

Ryt Bank isn't just a digital wizard; it's designed to be the bank that Malaysians can truly call their own. As it fluently converses in Bahasa Malaysia, English, and soon in Mandarin, Ryt Bank isn't just offering service—it's offering inclusivity. The star of the show? Ryt AI—an assistant that's more 'financial guide' and less 'calculating machine', powered by ILMU, Malaysia's pioneering language model.

### Banking Made Personal

Imagine having a personal assistant that handles everything from bill payments to financial snippets over a coffee chat. That's Ryt Bank's modus operandi. Whether it's snapping a bill to pay via DuitNow, accessing financial wisdom, or managing transactions in a secure and central app, Ryt Bank is the friend you didn’t know you needed, complete with a launch reward to prove its friendship.

### Security and Trust

Being an AI bank doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind. Ryt Bank is sitting snug under Bank Negara Malaysia's regulatory umbrella, with PIDM coverage for up to RM250,000 per account. So, along with the AI flair, you're getting security that would make even a James Bond villain envious.

With such strides in AI, are we truly on the cusp of redefining global banking, or is this just a flashy tech trend? Could AI reshape your financial future or leave you longing for the comfort of human touch?

1n0ghg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1n0ghg7/how_has_volpe_simplyfailed_to_show_any/,How has Volpe simply…failed to show any substantial progression?,"When he was called up in 2023, and went on to be underwhelming as a hitter despite defensive talent, it could’ve been chalked up to the FO being desperate for a consistent option at SS and the overreaction to his spring training performance. He still showed flashes in the hitting department with a 20-20 season. He also showed SOME improvement following the firing of Dillon Lawson, but quieted down in the last two months of the season. 

2024, he saw a decrease in power production. His Savant profile was worse all across the board - this year, however, his defense improved even more, being a true elite defender with 13 OAA. Interestingly enough, he went from slugging .553 against 4-seam fastballs in 2023 to .413 in 2024. Perhaps too many hitting coaches in his ear? One telling him to aim for the fences, show that pull-side power from the minors…and another telling him to just make contact and run to 1st. Which, not ideal for development. He at least looked good in the playoffs, and his poor season could’ve just been the ol’ “sophomore slump”. 

Now we reach 2025…a year where he started off hot and…it proved to just be his usual “flash in the pan” BS. Except this time, it’s not just that his hitting hasn’t progressed - he went from an elite defensive shortstop, to -7 OAA and being one of the worst defenders in the sport overall. His baserunning even took a hit, and he was just a straight up bad baseball player overnight. A progression in bat speed, from 69 MPH to 72 MPH, has not helped, and his walk rate hasn’t notably increased despite less chasing at pitches. Now, it seems most of the fanbase has given up on him, and rightfully so. 

The question is - what happened with Anthony Volpe? Did poor development do him in? Did we not have the right hitting coaches for him to succeed? Was his success in the minors unsustainable? Does his short build hinder his pull side power in the major league level? Perhaps, he was never really good to begin with, and the Yankees just loved the idea of a Jersey native making his way to the roster as a starter. Would explain why Volpe was given an entire 3 seasons of leeway, while Oswald Peraza was given a cup of coffee in the same timespan. 

Personally, I think the verdict is in - it’s time to look for other options. The sample size of Volpe being below average, along with the other facets of his game declining, means that if WE are serious about winning, Volpe cannot be starting beyond 2025. A career 85 wRC+ hitter at Shortstop, who now has regressed defensively, is a player that will always hold a team back, even with a generational talent in Aaron Judge leading the way.",6,1756197790.0,NYYankees,13,0.8,False

She’s my fav asmrtist and I thought she was really smart because she’s so creative and has such interesting scripts for her videos, but I’ve recently discovered

She sells “ASMR is not political” hats 😭😭

I’m insanely surprised seeing as she posts so many political videos such as: “it’s your government mandated bedtime”- a dystopian rp video. The whole dystopian genre is VERY political😭. As well as “don’t tell my boss”- a video about a coffee shop employee hating her job where at one point burning her hand on one of the machinery because her boss or the company or whatever is shit.

NOT TO MENTION the fact that she can post videos as a woman and get an income from it is very much political in itself. 😭 literally everything is affected by politics.

I’m just so disappointed bc only people who don’t want to be socially responsible for what their political views are do random stuff like claim things that are technically an art form aren’t political 😭.

We get compared to bands like Dinosaur Junior or the Meat Puppets, but there is also a classic rock feel to a lot of the songs. Or something like Camper Van Beethoven probably has some common ground. Hoping to kind of start fresh, though. Maybe a new group of songs. We usually rehearse once a week at a garage in deep Southeast near Lents TC Max stop. We usually play like one local show a month. Would like to be playing out of town more on Saturdays or Sundays. Ideally, looking for someone who’s into the music enough to be more than just a bass player. For example, our drummer edits music videos for us. The lead guitarist films our shows. Most of the songs have the bones written by me as the primary songwriter but we all share writing credits and it’s a band that I think is pretty open to collaboration and experimentation. Get in touch and we can get together for coffee or something to see if there is chemistry there. We just need someone who is solid with good tone.

Y’all, I’m confused how this even works but I’m not complaining. Here’s what actually surprised me:

- Most of the apps wanted me to just… play games?? Download, play for 5 minutes, share some feedback.
- A couple asked for screenshots as “proof”—literally the easiest money I’ve ever made.
- I even got bonus offers through **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** if I stayed active for 7 days (??).
- Some paid more than others but it BLOWS my mind that I could make $5-$20 PER test just chilling on my phone.

I kept thinking: Am I about to get scammed? Will my bank account get hacked? SPOILER: No weird charges, no spam calls, just 100 bucks… IN A DAY. 😳

How did I miss this side hustle sphere??!

The signup took like 3 minutes (not exaggerating), plus there were extra referral bonuses if you invited friends to **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** so now my group chat is feverishly clicking the link. Honestly this opened a rabbit hole for me:

- Could I literally pay my bills like this?!
- Why aren’t more people sharing the LEGIT pages like **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** ??
- How many coffees could I order with my new phone money? ☕️

I still don’t fully get what's happening behind the scenes—like, who is paying for this and is this sustainable? But I can’t argue with instant PayPal payout. Will it last? No idea. But if you need cash and own a phone, lowkey... just TRY it once.

If there’s an easier way to make $100 a day with zero investment except your thumb cramps from tapping the screen, please, let me know.

Has anyone here had wild results with app testing like this? Is there a catch I’m not seeing yet? For real, spill if you know more.

Otherwise, thank me (and really **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**) later. 🍀

1n0g8pp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0g8pp,Tried to age a ceramic insert,"So I tried to put together a project I abandoned and a watch I was bored with. I was going for a neo-vintage look and had no aluminum bezel that fit (only a green gold YM insert). I've read many times that it can't be done so here is a guide of how I did it. 

Before you start you need to first try to age your hands, make sure they don't match the indices on the dial, go overboard on aging so the lume falls out of at least one hand.

Then you change the flat sapphire crystal for a domed acrylic - this part is easy.

Now it is time for the ceramic insert, first you realize it doesn't fit over the domed crystal - so you diamond file it down - add some scratches while you are at it. Next step is to remove the lume pip - try to remove it by force and not through heat or IPA - while prying it off make sure you break the insert.

Next step is to age it in the oven with some coffee. I started with 180 degrees C - a temperature I know the coffee grounds can handle. Now you wait... after even 45 minutes nothing is happening. So up the heat to the max, 275 celsius. Now is the part where you go do something else while you wait. When you start smelling burning coffee you take it out. And voila!

Now you also have a nice burnt smell in the whole apartment while you look for an aluminum bezel to order. ",10,1756196819.0,SeikoMods,2,0.92,False

hey everyone, so i see a lot of posts about making money online but they're always super generic. i've actually been doing this for a while here in seattle and wanted to share some stuff that works specifically for our city. it's expensive here so you gotta get creative.  
  
1. bet you didn't think of this one, but you can become an online manager for local airbnb 'experiences'. seattle gets tons of tourists and locals offer cool things like guided hikes or food tours. a lot of these hosts are great in person but terrible at the online stuff. you can manage their bookings, marketing, and customer questions from your laptop for a cut of their earnings. pretty decent money if you get a few popular tours.  
  
2. local seo consultant for small businesses. with amazon and starbucks everywhere, the little guys get crushed online. if you know a bit about google and how to make a website show up in searches, you can offer your services to local coffee shops in ballard or boutiques in fremont. they need to show up when people search ""coffee near me"" and will pay someone who understands the seattle market to help them.  
  
3. Prked. honestly one of the easiest semi-passive things i've seen. parking in seattle is a nightmare, especially in places like capitol hill or near lumen field. if you have a driveway, garage spot, or even a patch of yard you're not using, you can rent it out online through prked. you just manage the listing on their platform. you can do short-term rentals for games and concerts which makes a killing, or just rent it out monthly to someone who lives in an apartment nearby with no dedicated parking. it's a solid stream of passive income once it's set up and you're helping a fellow seattlite out with the parking mess.  
  
4. tech-adjacent freelancing. this isn't just basic freelance writing. since we're in a huge tech hub, there's a big need for specialized skills online. think ux/ui testing for local startups, technical writing for software manuals, or even tutoring for coding bootcamps. these pay way better than generic online gigs because they require some specific knowledge.  
  
5. curating and selling pacific northwest gift boxes online. everyone loves the pnw vibe. you can create an online store where you sell curated boxes of local seattle goods – think stuff from theo chocolate, coffee from a local roaster, smoked salmon, and maybe some art from a pike place vendor. you handle the online orders and shipping. it's more work but can be super profitable.  
  
6. virtual assistant for tech workers. south lake union is full of busy people who will pay to get their time back. you can be a virtual assistant who specializes in helping them. you'd be managing their crazy calendars, booking travel, and handling other random tasks they don't have time for, all from your apartment.  
  
7. online fitness or yoga coaching for hybrid workers. so many people in seattle are on a hybrid work schedule. you can offer online fitness classes or one-on-one coaching specifically for them. think ""desk yoga"" sessions or quick lunchtime workouts they can do from home. you can market yourself in local facebook groups.  
  
8. transcription services for local podcasts. there are a surprising number of podcasts recorded in seattle. they often need their audio transcribed for show notes or accessibility. it's a flexible gig you can do anytime, and you get paid per audio hour.  
  
9. managing social media for local restaurants. a lot of amazing restaurants in seattle have a terrible online presence. you can offer to run their instagram and facebook pages, post pictures of their food, and run local ads to get more people in the door. you can manage a few at once from home.  
  
10. selling your photography online. if you have a good camera, you can take pictures of all the iconic seattle spots – kerry park, gas works, the mountains – and sell them on sites like etsy or shutterstock. tourists and local businesses are always looking for high-quality photos of the city.  
  
anyway, it's definitely possible to make a good living online here even with the high cost of living. you just have to find a niche that fits the city. you will have to get a seattle business license but you don't actually have to pay the b&o tax unless you're making over $100k a year, though you still have to file.

hey everyone, so you're thinking about starting a business in san francisco. good on you. it's a tough place to start something, not gonna lie, with all the permits and high costs, but it's also a city full of people with money who will pay for things that make their lives easier or more interesting. i've been around the block a few times with ventures here, so i wanted to share some ideas that aren't just ""open a coffee shop.""  
  
1. Electric scooter and bike repair service. seriously, everyone and their dog has an e-bike or a fancy scooter to get around their neighborhood, but when they break down, it's a huge pain. most bike shops are slammed. if you could run a mobile repair service, coming to people's homes or offices to fix their ride, you'd be a lifesaver. startup costs are pretty low, just tools, some parts, and a van or even just a cargo bike.  
  
2. bet you didn't think of this one: a parking space rental business. with a company called Prked, you can literally rent out your empty driveway, garage, or any parking spot you have. in a city where finding parking is a nightmare, this is a pretty solid opportunity for passive income. for a place like San Francisco, a secure garage spot would be gold. you can offer it for short-term parking if you're near a popular spot like the Mission or North Beach, but honestly, the real money is in monthly parking. tons of people in SF need a reliable place to keep their car long-term, especially in dense apartment areas. you just list your space and the app handles the rest. it's probably the lowest effort business you could start in San Francisco.  
  
3. niche food delivery subscription. forget a full-blown restaurant. the rent will kill you. instead, focus on a super specific need. think ""healthy, gluten-free meal prep for tech workers"" or ""authentic weekly taco kits from locally sourced ingredients."" people in sf have money but no time, and they care about what they eat. you can start this out of a commercial kitchen with way less overhead and build a loyal customer base online.  
  
4. personal tech and smart home consultant. this city is the tech capital, but that doesn't mean people know how to set up their 15 different smart devices so they actually work together. offer a service to help people automate their homes, improve their wifi, and secure their personal data. it's a service-based business with almost zero startup cost if you already know your stuff.  
  
5. sustainable living consultant. san franciscans love to be green, but they don't always know how. you could help people set up composting, do a ""waste audit"" of their home to help them reduce trash, or help small offices become more eco-friendly. it feels good and taps right into the local mindset.  
  
6. high-end pet services. people here treat their pets like children. so think beyond just dog walking. what about a ""pet adventure"" service where you take dogs on hikes in the marin headlands? or a gourmet, organic pet food cooking service? a mobile pet grooming van that saves people a trip to the groomer would also do incredibly well.  
  
7. freelance content creator for startups. there are a million startups and small companies here that need blogs, social media content, and videos but can't afford a full-time marketing person. if you're a good writer or creative, you can build a solid business just by managing the content for a handful of tech clients.  
  
8. personal assistant for busy professionals. this goes way beyond just running errands. you can manage calendars, book travel, organize homes, and basically be the ""second brain"" for a busy executive. it's all about trust and efficiency, and people will pay a premium for it.  
  
9. tour guide for something other than alcatraz. what about a food tour of the mission's best taquerias? or a history tour of the castro? or an architecture tour of pacific heights? find a niche you're passionate about and show people a side of san francisco they haven't seen.  
  
10. pop-up shop curator. retail space is expensive, but you can partner with local artists, designers, and chefs to create cool pop-up events in temporary spaces. you handle the logistics and marketing, and you take a cut. it's a way to get into the retail and events scene without signing a crippling 5-year lease.

1n0g45r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bubblic/comments/1n0g45r/loneliness_in_a_relationship_or_marriage_why/,Loneliness in a Relationship or Marriage: Why Platonic Friends Matter,"I believed a lie for years. If you’re in a relationship but feel lonely, you might believe it too:

>If my partner loves me, I shouldn’t feel lonely.

>If our romance is strong, I’d never crave other connections.

>If I ache for more, something must be wrong with us.

Here’s the truth: love can be real and vibrant, but still not meet every human need you have. That’s not a failure. That’s your nervous system asking for more kinds of connection.

# A story that changed my mind

Two months ago, I met a management director from New York online. She’s been married ten years and had the kind of partnership people envy: still holding hands, finishing each other’s sentences. One night she sent a voice note:

>""Some nights, I stare out the window feeling emptier than before we met.”

I asked, “But you’re happy with him, aren’t you?”

>She sighed, “We are. But I miss laughing until 2 a.m. about nothing with Sarah. I miss my roommate who gets my weird obsession with bird migrations.""

Treating romance as your only emotional lifeline is like building a mansion on sand. No matter how beautiful, without a foundation, it creaks.

* You might laugh with your partner and still crave someone who shares your niche passion.
* You can feel loved yet miss the friend who calls at midnight to say, “I saw this meme and thought of you.”
* You can have intimacy yet no one to vent to about your relationship.

Romance gives depth. Friendship gives breadth. One without the other leaves you emotionally malnourished.

# Loneliness in a relationship vs. loneliness in marriage: what it really means

Loneliness in a relationship doesn’t automatically mean the relationship is wrong. Often, it means the relationship is trying to carry *too much*.

As one colleague told me:

>“After my best friend moved abroad, my husband and I started fighting over laundry. Not because we stopped loving each other, but because he became my only outlet for everything: work stress, existential dread, my need for play. I was drowning him in unmet friendship needs.""

Your partner isn’t designed to be your:

* Therapist
* Hobby squad
* Personal cheerleader
* Archive of inside jokes from college

That’s too heavy for one person to carry. When you diversify your support, you protect your relationship from overload.

# Platonic friends are emotional infrastructure

Think of friendships as the roads, power lines, and bridges connecting you to the world. When they crumble, everything feels harder—even love.

Cultivating friendships isn’t betrayal. It’s maintenance. It keeps your emotional ecosystem resilient so you can show up to your relationship grounded, playful, and generous.

# A step-by-step plan to build authentic friendships

**1) Audit your emotional infrastructure**

List the last three times you felt truly seen. How many involved your partner vs. others? Gaps aren’t failures. They’re blueprints.

**2) Seek complementary connections, not clones**

* Your partner hates hiking? Find a trail buddy.
* They glaze over when you talk AI ethics? Join a philosophy community or Discord.
* They’re not into pottery? Take that class you bookmarked.

**3) Schedule friendship like a CEO**

* Text an old friend now: “Miss you. Virtual coffee next week?”
* Join one recurring group (book club, run club, improv, volunteering). Consistency creates closeness.
* Say yes to low-stakes invites: the coworker’s rooftop BBQ, the neighbor’s game night.

**4) Protect the ecosystem**

* Keep some hangouts low stakes—no deep talks required.
* Maintain unshared interests—your partner doesn’t need to attend.
* Give guilt-free space—your love isn’t a jail.

# How to talk to your partner about loneliness (without blame)

Use compassionate, forward-looking language:

* “I love us, and I’ve realized I need more friend time for play and venting. Investing in friendships will help me show up better with you.”
* “Can we protect one evening a week where we each do our own thing?”
* “If I’m sharing something best suited for a friend or therapist, can you flag it? I want to distribute the load better.”

# The gentle signpost

Loneliness in love isn’t a red flag. It’s a signpost: your heart has more rooms to furnish. The most resilient relationships I know stand on a web of connections: book clubs that outlast breakups, gym buddies who notice your silence, Internet friends who listen to your 15-minute voice notes.

Nurture your friendships not despite your love, but because of it. When you’re held by many hands, you hold your lover’s more gently.
