1qpjh4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1qpjh4j/unpopular_opinion_hypomania_and_mania_distinction/,unpopular opinion: hypomania and mania distinction is stupid/flawed.,"i say this as someone with type 1, i say this as someone who at one point had  been in psychosis for around 10 months straight  and made a lot of irreversible life ruining decisions. i say this as someone who became a hard drug addict because of mania.  i say this as someone who has been hospitalized twice and in the psych hospital twice. 

 of course i have had some “hypomanic” episodes, and i do believe there is a difference in manic episodes, hypomania to me felt like a continuous extra strong  mood boosting cup of coffee, while full mania just felt like straight up meth to me.  

because listen to this, the DSM-5 says that to be consider a manic episode as opposed to hypomania is based on if it causes significant impairment, but that is very flawed because that’s extremely dependent on life circumstances. for example, hypothetically, 2 people with the exact same internal mood state but eith 2 very different lives, one of them it causes significant impairment because they have more responsibilities and the other it doesn’t because they don’t, so same exact internal mood state in an ENDOGENOUS mood disorder, but 2 completely different diagnoses? i honestly prefer the DSM-3 where there wasn’t type 1 and 2 but just bipolar disorder and atypical bipolar disorder. 

to me, it’s all a form of mania, and it doesn’t have to fit in a box. you can just say yeah this a mild moderate or severe manic episode. especially since it’s well known that many people with type 2 can flip into a type 1 diagnosis anyways, so what does that say?

I did get offered 12 ounces of whole bean coffee, which was the first RFY items I was pretty interested in for weeks, if not months, so I grabbed that.  Didn't take the Oreos yet, due to high sugar, high carbs, but considering it just so I stay on their targeted food list.  Same deal w/some candy kiss-like chocolates, not shown.

1qpjg9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qpjg9f/forgetting_completing_tasks_at_the_last_step_any/,"Forgetting completing tasks at the last step, any hacks?","Kind of funny, I work from home and this morning I went to use my coffee machine (only ever operated by me since it stays in my office) and found a full cup of coffee just waiting there, meaning a cup of coffee was prepared all the way through but forgotten to be consumed.

It was actually me preparing for my wife, she was away playing with the dog, so she didn't mind that she didn't have coffee but might have thought I just forgot about it entirely when I was at the very last step, lol.

But I had been engaged through the whole process. I know this is an easy task but there are a few small subtasks that I had to do like fill water tank, pick a cup and a capsule, turn the machine on, observe if it spits coffee. As soon as it started making coffee I probably walked away never to look back.

Most interestingly is that 1h later I came back to the room and worked 3 more hours right next to the coffee machine, literally 2 feet away from it, while the cup was sitting there and I didn't notice this at all yesterday, only this morning. Not even smelled it.

Anyways! I wanted to ask any tips, hacks, etc from your personal experience that helps you remember small tasks that you started. I do have a very active task list app that works well with me for things that are big enough to get to be written there, but this was like an impromptu request from my wife so these small things I normally don't write as a todo task, I just went immediately to executing it. But I forgot to deliver the end result.

I'm not medicated, only doing treatment with CBT. This will certainly be a topic for my next session, but I wanted to hear from the community as well.",1,1769624598.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I chose to make a concept for a coffee shop refresh, since the ice cream shop got a refresh back in November (?), and the grocery store just had a refresh. Both were food-themed animals that fit the shop they're in. (Ice cream shop - Ice cream penguins and grocery store - fruit owls) Plus, also getting a legendary pet for the crystal egg fitting the theme, so here it is!

Coffee Bears! Maybe a bit biased because I'd love more bear pets, but the coffee concept is the main idea. I was thinking that, instead of honey, they could be tamed with cocoa beans or coffee beans.

Idk how feasible these designs are, given their unique designs, but it was mainly just to get my artist flow going. But let me know what you think anyway!",1,1769624572.0,AdoptMeRBX,1,1.0,False

The Greek community in this area is fairly tight so I ask if they knew you. They did! It felt strangely comforting. Obviously people knew you from the many restaurants you owned, but that isn't the man I knew. They knew you from church, they knew your principles.

I knew the one who worked quietly behind the scenes. The one who had business cards with his personal cell phone number and no mention of his business. I forget what the quote was on it, but it was a call to come closer to the lord. I remember the first time you complimented me on the care I gave your friend. I said ""thank you"" to which I got an ""achhh, no good Samantha. No good. When you receive a compliment you must reflect back on all who make it possible."" He pointed at the ceiling as I corrected myself and said ""we have a good team here."" You just nodded in agreement. 

From that point on you'd bring me rice pudding every time you knew I'd be at our friend's house. I'd stop by to get coffee for her and you'd never let me pay for it. ""Tell her to keep her money. It's no good!"" ""But it's for me!"" (she coached me on what to do in this scenario.) ""No it isn't. Tell her nice try.""  I could tell by the way you carried yourself you didn't receive much physical affection throughout your life and always made sure to give you a hug. ""Alright that's enough, you'll spoil me"" as your shoulders sunk into mine a bit. 

You liked that I paid close attention to the orthodox calendar for her, making note of feast days, name days, which days were no meat/dairy/oil. You raised an eyebrow when I brought her almond milk for her coffee on no dairy days. Your face said ""I'm not sure that's legal, but it isn't explicitly stated as being disallowed."" Neither of us paid any mind.

When I told her I wanted to make avegolemeno(sp?) soup you took my phone to check the recipe I found ""no."" What do you mean, no? ""No. Chicken broth? You don't need broth, you need a chicken."" The friends she had over from St. Nektarios monastery were in agreement. One suggested I start with learning to cook dandelion greens instead. 💀 

I'm going to miss your advice, your shit-talking, your kindness, and most of all I'm going to miss hearing about all the wonderful things you did for people and would never speak of. When I think of you I think first of your posture. Even in your 90's you stood firm, straight, tall.

Like a lot of things I’ve read, this has been a tiring journey for her to advocate for herself to finally get an MRI. Now that she has a diagnosis she’s spent the past week in a kind of mourning period. 

I’m trying to put together some items for her that will assist with her hand tremors and the weakness she experiences in her arms and hands. I have found: adaptive pens, can/jar/medicine bottle openers, non spill/leak coffee and wine tumblers, tab pulls for things like sodas and cat food, handles for water bottles, and even winged eyeliner stamps because the other day she sobbed when she was too shakey to do her makeup. Any other tips or items would be appreciated! 

I’m trying to be as supportive as possible with her. Any advice on how to assist her with the news of this diagnosis is welcome. We have our good moments, and then our scared moments.

1qpjc81,https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1qpjc81/postgluten_advice/,Post-Gluten Advice?,"Hi all,

I made a post about a month ago about how I’d been accidentally glutening myself all winter break with Lindt Chocolates 🥲

Since then, my every day has been a lot better but I still have some lingering stomach issues.

I can’t seem to even conceptualise coffee without getting an upset stomach even though before break I was making myself one everyday.

This week, I think I tested myself a bit too much… Throughout the week, I had a couple coffees, taco bell, wingstop, and smoked a cigarette and a joint ((all gluten free items from the fast food places btw)). Now I’ve been in bed with the worst upset stomach of my life. I threw up a couple days ago, and have been on a clear liquid diet until I had a singular rice cake this morning because I can barely stomach anything. Even the liquids (chicken broth, tea, etc) felt like they were causing burning in my stomach.

I’m wondering if it makes sense to you all that this could be lingering damage from the gluten I had throughout December (even though I’m gluten intolerant and not celiac)?

What do you guys do after you’ve been glutened to get yourself back to normal?

I’m thinking I might be trying to test things way too soon but I’m also not sure how strict I need to be on my diet before I can start enjoying things like coffee again.",1,1769624360.0,glutenfree,3,1.0,False

Its been a while since I've had company at my place. Chris and Noah made themselves at home. We picked up a few things at the store to put together. Figured a nice pasta dish would serve us all well for the evening.

We laid out our produce at the counter beside my stove top. Chris stood there over a cutting board, sleeves rolled up, chopping vegetables with more enthusiasm than skill.

“You sure that's enough garlic?” he asked as I stirred in the small mound he minced for me.

“There’s no such thing,” I said, sautéing them in with the onion.

Noah sat cross-legged on the floor by the coffee table, laptop open, pretending not to look at the encrypted drive plugged into its side. Pretending badly.

“So,” Noah said casually, “does she know yet?”

I didn’t look up. “She knows I asked her to dinner.”

Chris smirked. “A bold strategy, Holmes.”

“Easy, Watson,” I chuckled. “I didn't lie, I do want to see her. I've wanted to invite her over for dinner, just never found the right time.”

“And the classified data?” Noah asked.

“That’s dessert.”

There was a knock at the door.

I froze for half a second, just long enough for Chris to notice.

Chris grinned. “Relax, Romeo. I got this, go get the door.”

I wiped my hands on a towel, setting it down on the corner of the counter then headed over to the door. I skipped a beat as I turned the knob and opened the door.

Gabs stood there with a bottle of wine in one hand and a cautious smile on her face, like she wasn’t sure what version of the evening she’d just stepped into. Her brown hair glistened in the afternoon sun.

“Hey,” she said.

“Hey,” I replied, and for a moment, that was all there was. No Veil. No secrets. Just two people standing at the doorstep of a whole other time and place. Her big brown eyes stared up at me from the steps.

She held up the bottle. “I brought us something. You didn’t tell me what we were eating, so I took a guess.”

“Good choice, thank you,” I said, stepping aside. “Come on in.”

She stepped up and past me through the door. She was mid-compliment on the aroma and immediately clocked Noah on the floor and Chris at the counter. Her smile shifted. Not gone, just recalibrated.

“Oh,” she said lightly. “I didn’t realize this was a group thing.”

Noah chuckled, so did Chris who kept working the stove.

“Not a 'date' date, exactly,” I said quickly. “These are my coworkers. Noah, Chris... This is Gabriella. Gabs.”

Chris gave a polite wave. “Nice to finally meet you.”

Noah nodded. “I’ve heard good things. Mostly about your forensics work.”

She raised an eyebrow at Derek. “That so?”

He shrugged. “Yeah, dealing with murders and stuff isn't my thing, but I do IT work.”

She studied him for a second, then smiled and set the bottle down. “Alright,” she said. “What’s going on?”

I exhaled, relieved. “Okay. So. I really did want to see you. But… I also need your help.”

She laughed softly. “You could’ve led with that. You know I’m always happy to help you.”

Chris cleared his throat. “And also maybe illegally access some data.”

She looked at him. Looked back at Derek. “Ah. For one of your cases?”

Noah stood, lifting his laptop onto the table. “This is like, military grade encryption. We grabbed it, but I can’t crack it without tripping the alarm.”

Gabs’s expression shifted again. Not amused now, but focused. Interested.

“How bad is it?” she asked.

I didn’t sugarcoat it. “Bad enough that if we’re right, someone’s lying to us. Or worse.”

She pulled out a chair and sat. “Alright,” she said, rolling up her sleeves. “Show me what you’ve got.”

Noah turned the screen toward her. The room felt smaller all of a sudden.

She brought up the file, and Noah directed her to his pen-testing software.

""Hmm..."" she hummed, leaning in and studying the encryption, ""This is serious stuff. But I might have something...""

She opened up a few command prompts and started typing in lines of script, likely something she memorized from cracking encryption for the department.

""I don't have the processing like we do at the lab, so it's gonna be slow, but if I set this up right it will softly test the locks until it works its way past them.""

She made a few final clicks, and a loading bar appeared.

Chris set the pot down in the center of the table with a soft clatter. Steam curled up into the air, carrying the smell of garlic, tomatoes, and something vaguely Italian.

“Alright,” he said, grabbing plates. “Dinner’s served. Spaghetti a la Wolfe”

Noah glanced at the laptop. The progress bar crawled forward at a glacial pace.

“Six percent,” he said. “At this rate, I'll get gray hairs before it's finished.”

Gabs leaned back in her chair, arms folded, watching the screen. “So,” she said, casually, “you boys want to explain why I’m cracking military-grade encryption at your dining table?”

I twirled a fork in my fingers, swirling up some of the long pasta. “Yeah. About that.”

Chris slid a plate in front of her. “ You might wanna eat first,” he said, “you'll need the carbs to keep up with this story.”

She shot him a look. ""Really?”

Chris smiled thinly. “Hold onto your seat.”

Derek took a breath. “After I left the department… I didn’t exactly retire.”

Her eyes flicked to him. “I figured, one moment they were saying you're fired, then early retirement.”

“That was thanks to these guys, actually. At first, I was lost, Gabs. I couldn't stop thinking about Paul and Ethan. It just didn’t make sense. No bodies. No trails. Just… gone.”

I looked her in the eye ""I felt stuck... then I got a card from a stranger at the bar. An invitation to a group that was already dealing with the problem.""

Noah chimed in, twirling his fork. “Thats when he met us. We fight aliens that fall through holes in reality.”

She blinked once, stopping mid-chew. Didn't swallow. Her eyes flicked back and forth between me and Noah.

""Really Noah?"" Chris said ""Not subtle at all...  Not aliens. But we do deal with some strange things that the public is better off unaware of.""

She gently set her fork down, finally swallowing her bite.

“…Okay.” she said “Go on.”

We didn’t give her everything. Not all at once.Just enough.

We started with the forest. Creatures that didn’t belong. A phenomenon we call the Veil. Devices that close it. A secret organization she’d never heard of that definitely didn’t exist.

Her reactions shifted in stages. Disbelief, then skepticism, then the kind of quiet focus she got when a case stopped being impossible and started being real.

“That explains,” she said slowly, “all of our unresolved missing persons cases. And why you’ve been impossible to reach.""

I cracked a smile. “Yeah. We've been really busy.”

The loading bar ticked to thirty percent.

“So,” she said, setting her plate aside, “you’re telling me that while I’ve been chasing fraud and cybercrime, you’ve been fighting monsters from another dimension?”

Chris nodded. “Something like that, yeah.”

Noah added, “Sometimes with guns and explosives.”

She stared at us for a long moment, then laughed once. A sharp, almost disbelieving laugh.

“I leave you alone for four months,” she said, “and this is what you get into?”

I shrugged. “I got bored.”

She shook her head, but there was no real anger in it. Just awe. And concern.

“And this data,” she said, gesturing to the laptop, “you think it proves someone’s lying?”

“Yes,” I said. “Or hiding how bad things really are.”

We explained further about our suspicions over slices of apple pie. The details and absences of oversight and direction. Gabs nodded along quietly, a silent understanding of our present situation.

The bar hit ninety percent. The room went quiet without anyone saying a word.

A soft chime sounded.

“Got it,” Noah said, glancing at the screen.

We all leaned in to get a look.

Gabs clicked through the opening directory. Folders. Logs. Video reports.

Creature encounter data. Far more detailed than anything we'd been briefed on. Escalation charts showing increasing aggression. Stability graphs trending sharply downward.

“Jesus,” Chris muttered. “This never made it to our end.”

Gabs scrolled, her expression hardening. “This was intentionally buried.” 

""Or, Kept to exclusive access only."" I said

Then she opened a folder labeled:  RECOVERY SUBJECT

I felt my chest tighten.

Video footage loaded.

A young man in a sterile room. Pale and weak. Machinery that hummed faintly. The room around him sounded distorted. His voice came through warped, stretched, like it was struggling to stay in tune.

“Who is that?,” Noah whispered.

Gabs skimmed the accompanying memo.

“Changed at a molecular level… Recovery unsuccessful but ongoing… Use of resonance stabilizers only current viable solution. Thats all thats here...”

She looked up slowly. Her expression dropped from her face when she looked at me. I must have been white as a ghost, because I knew the man in that video.

“Is that...” she said quietly, “Ethan?.”

I felt the room start to spin. Dinner churned in my stomach.

“I'm sorry, Wolfe” she added.

I felt anger boil up to the surface. My footsteps were heavy as I backed away from the table and towards my sofa. I snatched up and threw my TV remote into the cushions, imagining it to be Masons tired, old face.

""That son of a... He lied to me. They both did.""

Everyone stared at me for a moment as I let the steam settle. Noah turned back to the screen.

""There's not much else here on him."" Noah said ""This must be just a black box for file sharing. If there was more it's been moved already.""

""Is there anything else we can recover?""

Noah pulled the GPS data back up, isolating the movement logs he’d salvaged earlier. Scanning what remained of the scrubbed data, he found sets of coordinates, local proximity recorded by the Spyglass. We hadn't compared it to a map just yet, but there seemed to be three seperate locations.

Chris leaned closer. “That’s not patrols.”

“No,” Noah said quietly. “That’s intentional travel.”

The coordinates repeated several times at each point. Repeated visits. Two areas had multiple sets of responses, the other seemed less traveled.

Gabs folded her arms. “So you think Ward’s running something off-book?”

“Or ahead of the book,” I said.

I stared at the screen. “One of these is Ethan.”

Silence settled in.

""I promised I wouldn't stop looking..."" I said quietly. ""We're getting him out.""

Finally, Chris exhaled. “Alright. Then we do this clean. Make this air tight, scout the locations, and find our man.”

""What do you have in mind?"" I asked Chris.

The plan was simple. We run our assigned shift as normal. Check the Veil. File reports. Be visible.

Then, when our official workday ended, we get to the real work. We set up our own shop out of the back of a plumbing van Declan suggested. Something mobile and unsuspicious. He disabled the tracking for it and the forestry truck, filing it under his maintenance checklist.

Noah and Gabs worked side by side, each manning a computer and keyboard.

“I can ghost us,” Noah said. “Mask our personal GPS signals. Spyglass will think we’re boring, hanging out at home.”

Gabs smirked. “Good, we don't want anyone to know we are onto them.”

Declan came through clear in our ears. “I’ll stay here at HQ. If something happens, or anybody starts acting up, I'll signal you.”

“Chris and I will hit the sites,"" I said, ""Quietly, if we can help it.”

“And if we can’t?” Chris asked.

My hand rested on my sidearm. “Then we improvise.”

Noah keyed up the first set of coordinates. A familiar stop, with an unfamiliar purpose.

Back out to the forest again. This time it was deeper in, further North where the forest was less traveled and thicker, and yet I felt like we had been circling this space before.

Chris killed the engine a quarter mile out. We went in on foot, pushing through the underbrush of a forgotten trail until the trees thinned just enough to reveal a clearing.

We both stopped behind the trees when we saw it.

“Well,” Chris muttered, “that’s not normal.”

The air itself was wrong. Not a tear, at least nothing active, but the space ahead looked fractured. Light bent oddly, splitting and rejoining in thin, prismatic lines, like a spiderweb made of glass hanging in the air.

The Veil had been worked here. A lot.

I crouched, scanning the ground. “Tire tracks. Unlike a truck. ATV maybe. There's footprints. Heavy, repeated travel."" I said, pointing out the prints and tracks coming and going.

Chris kicked at the dirt. “Someone brought equipment in. More than once.”

He reached down and picked something up between two fingers. A screw. Clean metal. Machined with a flat point.

Chris moved a few steps away, brushing leaves aside with his hand. “Stripped wires. Trimmed ends, with some red and blue insulation. The tips look burnt.”

Scattered under the leaves and pine needles were several spent shell casings. I picked one up. High caliber rounds were fired here.

We shared the same look.

“This wasn’t containment, exactly.” Chris said.

I turned back to the fractured air.

""Noah, are you getting anything?""

This place felt… tired. Overused. Like a muscle strained too many times without rest.

Chris held up a small device with an antenna attached, aiming it at the center.

Over comms, Noah’s voice came in low. “I’m reading Resonate instability all over the place. Its like that spot’s been opened and closed dozens of times.”

He paused then added “It’s not primed to open up, but if someone wanted to push it again…”

“It might shatter,” Chris finished.

I adjusted my hat, eyes fixed on the shimmering cracks. They hadn’t been simply closing the Veil here, It was a testing site.

""They must have been hiding these readings somehow"" Chris said, ""this would have absolutely been a huge red flag to Spyglass.""

""If they have been working the Veil that hard,"" Declan's voice came through, ""Then it's no wonder the other tears were getting worse.""

""Ripples in the pond,"" I thought.

“Log everything,” I said. “We move to the next coordinates.”

As we turned back into the trees, I noticed out of the corner of my eye the fractured light shimmered once, subtly, almost like a breath being taken.

Whoever was here stressed the Veil, making it unstable and our efforts elsewhere ineffective. What could you gain from stress testing a broken window?

The second set of coordinates repeated around a building back in the city along the Northwest side.

From the outside, it was nothing special.

A low concrete structure tucked behind a strip of storage units and an old tire shop. Fadsignage suggested this used to be several things over the years, but nobody came or went now.

No cameras visible from the road. The place where the name used to be over the door was faded and gone now, just a faint outline of lettering.

Chris stood beside me. “It certainly fits the bill for something we might set up and use, but I've never been here.”

I nodded. “Let’s see what’s inside.”

The door gave way easier than it should have.

That was the first bad sign. I looked to Chris and for just a moment, maybe for a half a second, my heart skipped and I saw Paul instead of Chris.

""You okay?"" Chris asked

""Yeah..."" I said pulling out my pistol, ""let's go.""

Chris drew his firearm and we pushed through together.

The front room looked far too clean for an abandoned building, but still carried the feeling of vacancy.

Further in, we found an office setup through a door that was left open. Two desks. A coffee maker with a burnt smell still clinging to it. Clipboards stacked neatly, papers filled with supply checklists. A calendar on the wall. everything was recent, but sat undisturbed.

Someone had left in a hurry.

Chris picked up a half-empty mug. “Still warm-ish.” He placed it back, “They were here recently.”

Nothing screamed secret lab yet. This room was just the paperwork end, pencils before scalpels. Another door sat against the opposite side. We opened it slowly.

The air hit first. It was cold and sterile. Cleaned recently, but not well enough to erase the past.

Metal tables lined the walls. Equipment scavenged from hospitals and research centers, some of it newer than it had any right to be. Power cables snaked across the floor into junction boxes drilled straight into concrete.

Chris stopped short. “This isn’t field triage.”

“No,” I said. “This is set up for full admittance.”

on a cursory glance around, there wasn't a soul in sight. We holstered our weapons, but remained wary of the space around us.

X-rays were clipped to a lightboard. Skeletal images. Human, but wrong in subtle ways. Bone density too high or too low in places. Fractures along the spine and rib cage.

Medical charts covered one wall.

Vitals. Notes. Certain phrases jumped out:

Cellular rejection persists

Stabilizer dependency increasing

Cognitive function remains normal

Chris scrunched his face slightly as he read over the charts. “Looks like they were trying to fix him, whatever happened.”

I said nothing. I wasn't sure what to think, my brain was already stretched thin like a rubber band. My first thought was experimentation, but if they were trying to understand, trying to help him, then that was different. Both options meant lies and secrets.

I remembered what Declan said: ""No one has ever survived going to the other side.""

What happened to you, Ethan?

The area at the back of the room was more disturbing.

There was a large framed box structure at the back corner of the room. Thick panels of glass set into the frame. External locking mechanism. ANCR hardware bolted into the top inside corners. Stabilizers, familiar tech, modified to be set up permanently. One of them was missing, the wires left hanging out of the frame. There was a bed, blankets, a toilet. Comfortable in the way a convict might appreciate.

I stepped inside slowly.

“This isn’t a cell,” I said quietly.

Chris frowned. “Looks like one.”

“It’s a pressure chamber,” I corrected. “This was how they kept him stable.”

Notes were scattered across a desk near the door.

""Subject shows no improvement.

Reversal attempts unsuccessful.

Long-term survival unlikely without continued exposure.""

Our eyes scanned the room, searching for signs of anything. But Ethan wasn’t there.

No blood. No struggle. Only thing missing from the room was the staff and one piece of equipment. Otherwise, it was just an empty space where a man had been treated and housed.

Chris broke the silence. “So, he didn’t escape.”

“No,” I said. “He was moved.”

“I’m not seeing any outbound transport from this site."" Noah chimed in on comms, ""if they took him...”

“They covered their tracks.” I finished.

I looked back at the Stabilizer mounts, the torn cables hanging through them out of the corner. 

""But why move someone who is in that critical a condition?""

Chris glanced around one last time. “So we’ve got a test site, a lab, and a missing man.”

I exhaled slowly. “And someone willing to keep pushing even after the damage was clear.”

The room felt colder than it should have.

“Let’s move,” Derek said. “Before whoever cleared this place realizes we’re onto them.”

As we stepped back into the sunlight, the building returned to what it had always pretended to be. Nothing worth noticing.

Noah’s voice came through the comms as we got into the truck, quieter than usual.

“I’ve got it. Third GPS hit just lit up when I cross-referenced the scrubbed data with the map.”

He paused.

“Decommissioned radio station,” Noah continued. “the coordinates track along where a maintenance tunnel goes underground.”

Chris glanced over. He didn't say anything. He didn't have to.

My hands tightened on the wheel. “That’s the one.” I nodded.

...The entrance was exactly as I remembered it. Just as I left it.

A square concrete doorway that angled down into the ground. I stood there staring at the worn, green metal door with the AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY sign stamped on the front. A chain with a lock had been cut off and tossed around the corner. I felt a chill seep into my bones that held me frozen in place. I swallowed, my throat dry, distracting me from Chris' presence as he walked up to me.

He stopped beside me on my left. “Hey.”

I looked over.

“I’ve got you,” Chris said, simple and solid. “You're not going back in alone. Not this time.”

I looked him in the eye for a moment and nodded “Let’s do this.”

The air below was cold and stale, carrying the familiar faint metallic tang of old wiring and damp stone. Our boots echoed softly against concrete as we moved deeper, our gun-mounted lights cutting through the shadows down branching corridors.

The same old conduit and water lines ran along the walls. Same thick cable channels disappeared into the dark, some still humming faintly with residual power rerouted decades ago. Same faint tapping of dripping water somewhere in the dark. Each step felt heavy as we made our way down the main tunnel. I slowed to a stop about halfway, aiming my light on the concrete floor, illuminating a spot that had a darker stain.

Chris muttered, ""It was here, wasn't it?""

I didn’t answer.

Chris tried the comms but received only static, ""Must be interference from the utilities.""

""Just like before."" I muttered, getting a tighter grip on my pistol.

We checked through several doors.

Heavy steel ones. Utility access rooms. Emergency bulkheads meant to compartmentalize damage. Each one was stamped with faded city markings and numbers that hadn’t mattered in decades.

Every door I opened felt like another layer being peeled away.

“This place is a maze.” Chris muttered. “You could lose a small army down here.”

“That’s the idea.” I said. “No one comes down here unless something’s already gone wrong.”

The last bulkhead opened into a much larger chamber.

Concrete walls stained by time and mineral runoff. Thick water mains as wide as tree trunks ran along the ceiling, branching off in multiple directions, each marked with old district codes. Valves the size of car tires lined the walls. Pressure gauges sat frozen at unreadable numbers. Lights were arranged around the room for illumination.

This was the city’s circulatory system. And it had been repurposed.

Crates were stacked near the entrance. Black equipment cases, most of them empty. We recognized them immediately.

“Those are ours,” Chris said quietly, “from HQ.”

Automatic rifles leaned against one crate, neatly arranged. Extra vests. Power cells. Rations. This was a safehouse.

We became aware we weren't the only ones in the room when we heard a faint humming coming from the side. We stepped down and checked to the left... and there he was.

Ethan sat in the far corner of the room, under a blanket on a chair where the concrete was cleaner and drier. Someone had cleared the space deliberately. Two bottles of water and an MRE sat on a stool next to his chair.

A stabilizer unit stood in front of him on a tripod, angled towards him. The device emitted a low, steady hum, constant and controlled. A battery pack was wired to it and taped onto the outside.

No shimmer. No visible distortion. Just the faint sense that the air there behaved differently.

Ethan looked… thinner. Paler.

Dark circles sat beneath his eyes, and his shoulders slumped with exhaustion. He looked like someone who hadn’t slept properly in years.

When he lifted his head and saw me, he froze.

For a moment, he didn’t speak. His expression cracked with recognition. Not fear, not shock, but something closer to disbelief.

“…Derrick?” he said quietly.

I swallowed. “Yeah, it's me. I'm here.”

A faint, breathless laugh escaped Ethan. “I thought… I thought you stopped looking.”

“Not a chance."" I stepped closer. ""I'm sorry I took so long.”

Tears started to well up in his eyes, but he blinked them away. “Guess I should’ve known better. You never gave up on dad.”

Chris stayed back, giving us space.

Ethan shifted slightly, wincing, some from pain, but also fatigue. “You shouldn’t be here. This place isn’t...”

“Safe?” I finished. “That ship sailed a while ago, buddy.”

A smile stretched his tired face.

I glanced at the stabilizer. “Is it helping?”

“It keeps things… comfortable,” Ethan said. “Without it, everything hurts, like I'm on fire.”

“They told you they could fix this?”

Ethan looked down. “They tried... Caleb told me a lot of things.”

""Caleb?"" I thought.

Before I could say anything further, a slow clapping echoed from the doorway.

“Well, well,” a familiar voice called, “if it isn’t Secret Squirrel and his sidekick.”

We turned toward the door

Richard Payne stepped into the chamber, boots crunching softly against the concrete. Aviators hung from his collar. Mustache immaculate. That same smug tilt to his mouth.

Beside him... Ward.

He moved calmly, hands relaxed at his sides. His eyes swept the room once, assessing the scene. No surprise. No anger. Just calm.

Behind them stood three armed personnel in black uniforms and tactical vests. Faces forgettable, expressions disciplined.

Payne grinned wider. “Gotta admit, Ward called it. Said you'd sniff this place out sooner or later.”

Ward’s gaze settled on me. “I didn't think you would come back here, after what happened.” he said evenly. “But I prepared for it.”

Chris shifted his stance in our direction.

Ward glanced briefly at Ethan, then back to me. “Don't worry, he will be safe here.”

Ethan didn’t look up.

""And slowly dying because of your interferance.” I said quietly.

Ward’s expression didn’t change.

“No,” he replied, “he’s dying because the Veil exists at all.”

Chris moved instantly, stepping over beside us with a hand on his pistol.

Ward raised one hand, “That won’t be necessary.”

His eyes went to me, steady and unreadable.

“I wondered how long it would take you,” Ward said, “you always did notice patterns faster than most.”

I clenched my jaw. “Where’s the Director?”

“He isn’t part of this.” Ward said. “Never was.”

I wasn't sure if I should be relieved to hear that.

“What does that mean?” I asked. “You went over his head?”

Ward shook his head slightly. “No. I went around him. The Director manages response. Damage control. Optics.” He paused. “This requires resolution.”

Chris laughed, sharp and humorless. “You don’t get to decide that.”

Ward looked at him then, really looked at him. “You’re wrong,” he said calmly, “I do. Someone has to.”

He nodded once.

Two soldiers stepped in fast while the third kept a rifle trained on us. Chris reacted, but they were too fast. One stuck him in front, knocking the wind out of him and the other tazed him as he went down. They took his pistol once he was on the ground. I called after him and attempted to move to his aid, but the gunman shifted closer, aiming the rifle squarely at me. A warning, so I backed down.

“Take him upstairs.” Ward said, voice even. “Secure him. No unnecessary force.”

They picked him up and carried him out of the doorway. The other uniformed soldier and Payne followed them out.

Then he was gone.The room felt smaller without him. Just the three of us now.

I turned back to Ward. “You didn’t have to do that.”

“Yes,” Ward said, “I did. We both know he's resourceful.""

Silence stretched between us, thick with the hum of Ethan's stabilizer and distant echoes in the tunnels beyond.

I spoke next, slowly. “You scrubbed the logs. Hid the data. You knew we’d come looking.”

Ward nodded once. “I counted on it.”

“Why?” I asked. “Why not just settle your plans and disappear?”

“Because,” Ward said, “I needed you to see this.”

He gestured to Ethan. To the stabilizer. To the room itself.

“This is the cost of hesitation,” Ward continued, “of treating the Veil like something we can manage indefinitely. Patch after patch. Breach after breach.""

I shook my head. “You don’t know that. We’re learning...”

“We’re stalling,” Ward cut me off, not sharply, but firmly, 

“and people are paying for it. Samantha paid for it. Ethan. Others will too.”

His voice softened, just a fraction.

“I won’t let this continue.”

I felt the weight of it then. Not madness. Not cruelty. This was conviction, and resolve.

“What are you going to do, Caleb?”

Ward stepped back toward the door. “Finish it. For good. One last time.”

He stepped out and began to close the door. I noticed then there was no latch on the inside.

“You’re sealing us in here?” I demanded.

Ward shook his head. “Securing you. There’s a difference.”

He looked at Ethan, then to me.

“You’ll be safe,” Ward said, “the stabilizer will hold for Ethan until we are done.”

“And when you are?"" I asked, ""what then?” 

Ward paused, hand resting on the door.

“When I’m done,” he said, “there won’t be anything left to interfere with. No more stalling. No more breaches.”

He looked at us one last time.

“I truly hoped you’d understand.”

The door sealed shut with a metallic clang.

The locks finished squeaking closed as the wheel turned, and the chamber settled into a new silence, leaving just me and Ethan alone together. I had finally found him, and ended up sealed away myself in the process, with no way out and no way to call for help.",2,1769624271.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1qpj928,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qpj928/i_reached_out_after_a_week_and_bit_the_bullet/,I reached out after a week and bit the bullet...,"So, in my previous post I mentioned I was with my ex for 7 years.

In another post, I mentioned how despite all of her wishes for us to keep in touch, she went ice cold on me.

So... I sent her a voice note on Sun because a few days prior, I messaged her and asked if we could talk (I didn't mention how I found her behaviour contradicting her words) with no expectation or obligation. 

She told me she was unavailable as she was working and it was her dad's bday (fair enough) so she would contact me either tomorrow (last Fri) or over the weekend.

I found that quite insulting considering the desire to keep in touch. I felt dead to her.

Anyway, in my voice note I told her exactly what I thought of her behaviour and I couldn't believe her hypocrisy.

She texted me the following morning, told me why she ended the relationship. 

I won't get into specifics but it was something that happened between us close to 4 years ago. 

It was traumatic when it happened, but we healed together over the next 4 years. For 3 of those years we were living our ultimate life.

So I called her out on this and asked that if she really felt this way, why didn't she break up 4 years ago when it happened. She also claims that we never spoke of this event (we did MANY times). I then asked her that if she really felt the way she did, why did our relationship actually improve so much over time and why was she so happy to share a home and a bed with me - if she ""really"" felt this way. 

During ""the talk"" she also threw in things like my road rage - guys I lived in Spain for a year and had to get used to a whole different job, language, driving, etc. A totally different way of life. Hey, I struggled. One of the ways it manifested itself was in road rage because (and I really don't mean to offend) but drivers in Spanish villages are the most inconsiderate, dangerous drivers I ever encountered - and this comes from someone who grew up in an impoverished area in which car thieves were rampant. Even they had better road etiquette! 

This apparently made her feel uncomfortable - after 7 years.

It was also my dislike for the job I had to do. It was actually awful but then again, I thought I could talk about my concerns and frustrations with the love of my life - as she did me every single day. She had the same (if not more) issues with her family (our employers) and their constant issues and backstabbing each other. She also done other wee odd jobs which she had some gripes about - again, I provided the shoulder for her. Also, when she done these odd jobs, sometimes I'd have to wait in the car for 20, 30, sometimes 45 mins and entertain myself. I never complained once and often helped.

She also said it was the ""little things"" then immediately commented on how I made sure she had a coffee every morning. Instant contradiction. She realised this then said ""no, it's more holding my hand when we're out driving and that."" Again, this is a barefaced lie, either this or she suddenly developed amnesia. She must've also forgotten about how every single time she walked by me, I'd often call her sexy, cute, beautiful, gorgeous - in her pyjamas.

When we first met, she was an ex-addict. I never judged.

During the relationship, she injured her hand and sustained nerve damage so went on really strong meds for years often sleeping through the day. I didn't then, either. All I did was nurture her like anyone in a loving relationship would.

I don't say the things above for any sort of accolade or pride. I say this because it has been around a week and a half since my life feels like it got ruined and I'm doing my best to adjust and start over. I can't tolerate liars (or users) and called her as such in my reply.

My sis has her on IG and showed me the stories of her enjoying a wee road trip 3 hours away from where we used to live. I know she's there with some mystery friend that appeared from nowhere maybe a week or so before we broke up. I think she felt so guilty about this other relationship (or budding feelings) and tried to throw every single bad thing I've ever done at me just to justify her decision to break up - this is of course after we spent a week living together post break-up having a wonderful, final time together.

Know what I absolutely hate about myself right now, though? I would still forgive her in a heartbeat and jump on the next plane back out to her (if she paid of course lol). ",1,1769624175.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I posted a few days ago, and got some nice responses (thank you if you were one of them!), but none of the conversations lasted more than a couple of days. 

I've realized that most people on here, seem to only be looking for an online connection. While I totally respect that, I am definitely looking to meet somebody in person, and see if we have any kind of connection that would lead toward us dating.

You don't need to live right next to me or anything, but I would prefer to keep my driving time to 1 hour, so that it would even make sense for us to meet up for dinner once in awhile.

I don't want to put my location out here for the entire internet to see, but I'm happy to share my general location with you if you want to send me a message. It would also be nice if you would offer your name and a picture, at least after a few texts, if you wish to continue the conversation.

I hope to hear from you, and even if I don't, thank you for reading and I hope you have a great day!",1,1769624018.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I LOVE this dosage but holy fuck I can’t think straight, honestly I can’t think at all. I feel like a bimbo and the semester has started and I can’t focus in my lectures like I did before. Prior to Lexapro, I was on Vyvanse and Strattera which was nice but too many side effects so I swapped out.

I try to drink coffee and it makes me even MORE tired. When I increased to 50mg Vyvanse it was too intense (although that was 5mg Lexapro). What can I do to increase my focus and energy? I am currently at a new job and I need to lock in 😩

1qpj4zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/1qpj4zh/bilateral_piriformis_syndromesciatica/,Bilateral Piriformis Syndrome/Sciatica,"Let me preface this by saying I do have an appointment to see my doctor about this next week, but I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this...

(Also, I'm 42 female)

So summary of the progression so far:

- December 2007 (age 23) I was in a car accident. I got checked out by paramedics on scene but did not go to the hospital. I had minor stiffness the next day but after a couple days I felt fine and never had any other issues 

- December 2008 (age 24) I was working 2 jobs, one as a hairdresser and one in a coffee shop, literally 7 days a week, ~50 hours a week, on my feet 

- early 2009 (age 25) I developed pain in my lower back, near the base of my spine, but not on my spine, to the left of it. The pain started suddenly and progressively got worse. I delayed seeking medical care at the time because I was 25 and figured it would go away on its own, because I was young and healthy and also went to the gym regularly

- after a few months, I finally went to my doctor. I could feel a hard lump where the pain was coming from. My doctor literally poked it a couple times and said it was scar tissue from a torn muscle that didn't heal properly, probably from my car accident. I asked how I could have torn a muscle and not felt it and he said ""it happens."" He also said, and I quote ""the chances of this being something serious, like a tumour, are very low. I'm talking once in a doctor's career type low, and I've already had a patient with a tumour on their spine."" ... I never once even thought it might be a tumour, for the record. He told me not to bother with physiotherapy because the damage was already done, and it would help. I would just have to learn to live with it.

- I learned that the pain increases with rest, but feels better when I move, and that certain yoga poses like child's pose and pigeon pose help, so I kind of learned to manage the pain. 

- after about a year, it just stopped hurting. The lump was gone and I felt fine. It was odd but I figured my doctor was wrong and whatever it was had healed

- over the next few years, sometimes it would flare up again, but never as bad as the first time, and usually from using certain machines at the gym, so I would just avoid the ones that made it hurt. I was still working both jobs, but down to 40 hours a week, and whenever it would flare up, it would only last a few days or a week, and go away

- fast forward to 2016, and it came back with a vengeance. Full debilitating pain again, and the hard lump was back. I decided to go see a massage therapist, thinking it would help break up the scar tissue. The RMT felt the spot and said ""I don't feel any scar tissue at all"" then he pressed the spot where the lump was and said ""this is your sacroiliac joint. It's inflamed and that's what's causing the pain. The lump you're feeling is the swelling

- I did not go back to my doctor because he never listened to me anyway, and I started learning self-care for SI joint dysfunction and it seemed to work, and the pain went away completely 

- fast forward to 2023, and I fell and sprained my left ankle badly, and I was walking with a limp for quite a while. After a couple months, the pain flared up again, but this time it was on the right side. Same pain, same spot but to the right of my spine. I had never felt it on that side before. It never got as bad as it did on the left side, but it was consistently flaring up on the right side for 2 years

- then the most recent thing... Dec 28th, 2025, I spent a couple hours scraping ice off of my driveway (and I definitely was not thinking about my posture, or lifting with my legs). I never fell, but I did do that thing where you slip and catch yourself, and your whole body tenses up and it hurts for a bit. Then I did hair for 6 hours, but my back felt fine then. When I went to bed that night, my tailbone started to ache. It was like a dull ache, like I'd been sitting all day on a hard bench or something, but I'd been on my feet all day. I thought it was weird but I just took some advil and went to sleep

- Dec 29 morning I got up and instantly all of the muscles from the middle of my back, down both of my legs started seizing up, like a massive Charley horse. I could even stand up straight. But I got into a hot shower and it calmed down. I was sore the rest of the day, but it was tolerable. I worked that day as well 

- Dec 30 - I was still sore but no worse than the day before, and figured I pulled a muscle, so I just took NSAIDs, iced it and tested it

- Dec 31 & Jan 1 - for 48 hours straight, all of the muscles in my butt, my hamstrings and my calves were twitching non-stop, and my lower back was really starting to ache, and I was having a hard time sitting still 

- Jan 2 - the twitching stopped, but I was SO sore. I thought it was probably from the twitching, my muscled had basically not stopped moving for 48 hours, so it made sense they were sore. And my lower back was hurting a lot

- Jan 3 - my lower back muscles seized up again, and I couldn't stand up, so I got in a hot shower again and they loosened up, but when I got out of the shower, I went numb from my hips down to my feet, both legs and my entire pelvis. So I went to the emergency room, and they diagnosed me with piriformis syndrome. The doctor put me on 700mg of Gabapentin for 30 days, plus Naproxen and hydromorphone for the first 7 days, and told me I needed to go to physiotherapy 

- the first week (while I was still on the hydromorphone) I felt great, almost no pain. The second week was absolute agony. Literally the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. It would make me feel nauseous and I would be shaking uncontrollably. 

- the third week, it started to get better, but that's when I really started to notice the numbness and muscle weakness (probably because I was actually moving more). 

I'm still numb on both of my butt cheeks, and the backs of my thighs, but not my inner thighs like saddle anesthesia... Basically wherever your butt/top of your legs touch a chair when sitting, that's where I'm numb. But it's like surface level numbness (I don't really know how else to describe it lol)... like, if I touch my skin I can't feel it, but if I poke it, I can feel that deeper down. I haven't had any incontinence issues, and I can still feel when I need to pee or poop, but the numbness fluctuates and I can't always feel the toilet paper when I wipe. 

Sometimes the numbness is replaced by burning pain, and sometimes it's like a throbbing pain in my groin, which I have read is a symptom of piriformis syndrome in women.  

But what worries me a lot is that it's bilateral, which is apparently supper rare in piriformis syndrome (so rare that there aren't stats on it). The pain started in my tailbone and moved to my left leg, and also my SI joint on the left side has been hurting again since this started. The pain has moved back up and improved a lot... It's not gone, but it's tolerable now, and it's mainly at my tailbone and my left butt cheek. Occasionally if i move the wrong way I get an intense pain in my tailbone, but it passes quickly.

But the numbness is on both sides, and I'm also experiencing muscle weakness in the backs of my legs on both sides. My left buttcheek is more numb than my right buttcheek, but my right foot is more numb than my left foot. They're both only numb in the heel now, but I also can't stand on my toes on either foot, and I noticed I'm standing with all my weight on my heels. If I try to stand normally, my toes curl up to hold my balance. 

I have an appointment to see my doctor next week (not the same doctor I mentioned before,  he finally retired and I have a new doctor now), and I also have my physiotherapy assessment next week. I've been monitoring my symptoms and if they get worse I'll be going back to the hospital.

I've never had an MRI or even an X-ray and I feel like maybe I should?

Anyway... I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this... I'm worried about the bilateral numbness because everything I've read says that's a symptom of cauda equina syndrome, but I don't have any of the other symptoms.

I have all the symptoms of piriformis syndrome, except that it's basically never bilateral. It's so rare that the cases where it does happen become case studies, and they are almost always in high performance athletes (which I most definitely am not lol) 

I don't work two jobs anymore, but I am still a hairdresser which is a career that is notorious for causing lower back problems. 

And also, this is the one doctors never take seriously when I mention it, but my left leg is 1.5 inches longer than my right leg. Limbs are never symmetrical, but from what I've read that is a bigger difference than is considered normal. 

The ER doctor even said that my pelvis was misaligned and I said ""well I do have one leg longer than the other"" and he laughed and said  ""do you walk in circles?""

Like, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like that could cause my pelvis to be misaligned? But maybe not... 

Anyway... I mostly just needed to talk about this because I don't know anyone who has experienced the same thing and it's kind of isolating. ",1,1769623942.0,Sciatica,0,1.0,False

Its been a while since I've had company at my place. Chris and Noah made themselves at home. We picked up a few things at the store to put together. Figured a nice pasta dish would serve us all well for the evening.

We laid out our produce at the counter beside my stove top. Chris stood there over a cutting board, sleeves rolled up, chopping vegetables with more enthusiasm than skill.

“You sure that's enough garlic?” he asked as I stirred in the small mound he minced for me.

“There’s no such thing,” I said, sautéing them in with the onion.

Noah sat cross-legged on the floor by the coffee table, laptop open, pretending not to look at the encrypted drive plugged into its side. Pretending badly.

“So,” Noah said casually, “does she know yet?”

I didn’t look up. “She knows I asked her to dinner.”

Chris smirked. “A bold strategy, Holmes.”

“Easy, Watson,” I chuckled. “I didn't lie, I do want to see her. I've wanted to invite her over for dinner, just never found the right time.”

“And the classified data?” Noah asked.

“That’s dessert.”

There was a knock at the door.

I froze for half a second, just long enough for Chris to notice.

Chris grinned. “Relax, Romeo. I got this, go get the door.”

I wiped my hands on a towel, setting it down on the corner of the counter then headed over to the door. I skipped a beat as I turned the knob and opened the door.

Gabs stood there with a bottle of wine in one hand and a cautious smile on her face, like she wasn’t sure what version of the evening she’d just stepped into. Her brown hair glistened in the afternoon sun.

“Hey,” she said.

“Hey,” I replied, and for a moment, that was all there was. No Veil. No secrets. Just two people standing at the doorstep of a whole other time and place. Her big brown eyes stared up at me from the steps.

She held up the bottle. “I brought us something. You didn’t tell me what we were eating, so I took a guess.”

“Good choice, thank you,” I said, stepping aside. “Come on in.”

She stepped up and past me through the door. She was mid-compliment on the aroma and immediately clocked Noah on the floor and Chris at the counter. Her smile shifted. Not gone, just recalibrated.

“Oh,” she said lightly. “I didn’t realize this was a group thing.”

Noah chuckled, so did Chris who kept working the stove.

“Not a 'date' date, exactly,” I said quickly. “These are my coworkers. Noah, Chris... This is Gabriella. Gabs.”

Chris gave a polite wave. “Nice to finally meet you.”

Noah nodded. “I’ve heard good things. Mostly about your forensics work.”

She raised an eyebrow at Derek. “That so?”

He shrugged. “Yeah, dealing with murders and stuff isn't my thing, but I do IT work.”

She studied him for a second, then smiled and set the bottle down. “Alright,” she said. “What’s going on?”

I exhaled, relieved. “Okay. So. I really did want to see you. But… I also need your help.”

She laughed softly. “You could’ve led with that. You know I’m always happy to help you.”

Chris cleared his throat. “And also maybe illegally access some data.”

She looked at him. Looked back at Derek. “Ah. For one of your cases?”

Noah stood, lifting his laptop onto the table. “This is like, military grade encryption. We grabbed it, but I can’t crack it without tripping the alarm.”

Gabs’s expression shifted again. Not amused now, but focused. Interested.

“How bad is it?” she asked.

I didn’t sugarcoat it. “Bad enough that if we’re right, someone’s lying to us. Or worse.”

She pulled out a chair and sat. “Alright,” she said, rolling up her sleeves. “Show me what you’ve got.”

Noah turned the screen toward her. The room felt smaller all of a sudden.

She brought up the file, and Noah directed her to his pen-testing software.

""Hmm..."" she hummed, leaning in and studying the encryption, ""This is serious stuff. But I might have something...""

She opened up a few command prompts and started typing in lines of script, likely something she memorized from cracking encryption for the department.

""I don't have the processing like we do at the lab, so it's gonna be slow, but if I set this up right it will softly test the locks until it works its way past them.""

She made a few final clicks, and a loading bar appeared.

Chris set the pot down in the center of the table with a soft clatter. Steam curled up into the air, carrying the smell of garlic, tomatoes, and something vaguely Italian.

“Alright,” he said, grabbing plates. “Dinner’s served. Spaghetti a la Wolfe”

Noah glanced at the laptop. The progress bar crawled forward at a glacial pace.

“Six percent,” he said. “At this rate, I'll get gray hairs before it's finished.”

Gabs leaned back in her chair, arms folded, watching the screen. “So,” she said, casually, “you boys want to explain why I’m cracking military-grade encryption at your dining table?”

I twirled a fork in my fingers, swirling up some of the long pasta. “Yeah. About that.”

Chris slid a plate in front of her. “ You might wanna eat first,” he said, “you'll need the carbs to keep up with this story.”

She shot him a look. ""Really?”

Chris smiled thinly. “Hold onto your seat.”

Derek took a breath. “After I left the department… I didn’t exactly retire.”

Her eyes flicked to him. “I figured, one moment they were saying you're fired, then early retirement.”

“That was thanks to these guys, actually. At first, I was lost, Gabs. I couldn't stop thinking about Paul and Ethan. It just didn’t make sense. No bodies. No trails. Just… gone.”

I looked her in the eye ""I felt stuck... then I got a card from a stranger at the bar. An invitation to a group that was already dealing with the problem.""

Noah chimed in, twirling his fork. “Thats when he met us. We fight aliens that fall through holes in reality.”

She blinked once, stopping mid-chew. Didn't swallow. Her eyes flicked back and forth between me and Noah.

""Really Noah?"" Chris said ""Not subtle at all...  Not aliens. But we do deal with some strange things that the public is better off unaware of.""

She gently set her fork down, finally swallowing her bite.

“…Okay.” she said “Go on.”

We didn’t give her everything. Not all at once.Just enough.

We started with the forest. Creatures that didn’t belong. A phenomenon we call the Veil. Devices that close it. A secret organization she’d never heard of that definitely didn’t exist.

Her reactions shifted in stages. Disbelief, then skepticism, then the kind of quiet focus she got when a case stopped being impossible and started being real.

“That explains,” she said slowly, “all of our unresolved missing persons cases. And why you’ve been impossible to reach.""

I cracked a smile. “Yeah. We've been really busy.”

The loading bar ticked to thirty percent.

“So,” she said, setting her plate aside, “you’re telling me that while I’ve been chasing fraud and cybercrime, you’ve been fighting monsters from another dimension?”

Chris nodded. “Something like that, yeah.”

Noah added, “Sometimes with guns and explosives.”

She stared at us for a long moment, then laughed once. A sharp, almost disbelieving laugh.

“I leave you alone for four months,” she said, “and this is what you get into?”

I shrugged. “I got bored.”

She shook her head, but there was no real anger in it. Just awe. And concern.

“And this data,” she said, gesturing to the laptop, “you think it proves someone’s lying?”

“Yes,” I said. “Or hiding how bad things really are.”

We explained further about our suspicions over slices of apple pie. The details and absences of oversight and direction. Gabs nodded along quietly, a silent understanding of our present situation.

The bar hit ninety percent. The room went quiet without anyone saying a word.

A soft chime sounded.

“Got it,” Noah said, glancing at the screen.

We all leaned in to get a look.

Gabs clicked through the opening directory. Folders. Logs. Video reports.

Creature encounter data. Far more detailed than anything we'd been briefed on. Escalation charts showing increasing aggression. Stability graphs trending sharply downward.

“Jesus,” Chris muttered. “This never made it to our end.”

Gabs scrolled, her expression hardening. “This was intentionally buried.” 

""Or, Kept to exclusive access only."" I said

Then she opened a folder labeled:  RECOVERY SUBJECT

I felt my chest tighten.

Video footage loaded.

A young man in a sterile room. Pale and weak. Machinery that hummed faintly. The room around him sounded distorted. His voice came through warped, stretched, like it was struggling to stay in tune.

“Who is that?,” Noah whispered.

Gabs skimmed the accompanying memo.

“Changed at a molecular level… Recovery unsuccessful but ongoing… Use of resonance stabilizers only current viable solution. Thats all thats here...”

She looked up slowly. Her expression dropped from her face when she looked at me. I must have been white as a ghost, because I knew the man in that video.

“Is that...” she said quietly, “Ethan?.”

I felt the room start to spin. Dinner churned in my stomach.

“I'm sorry, Wolfe” she added.

I felt anger boil up to the surface. My footsteps were heavy as I backed away from the table and towards my sofa. I snatched up and threw my TV remote into the cushions, imagining it to be Masons tired, old face.

""That son of a... He lied to me. They both did.""

Everyone stared at me for a moment as I let the steam settle. Noah turned back to the screen.

""There's not much else here on him."" Noah said ""This must be just a black box for file sharing. If there was more it's been moved already.""

""Is there anything else we can recover?""

Noah pulled the GPS data back up, isolating the movement logs he’d salvaged earlier. Scanning what remained of the scrubbed data, he found sets of coordinates, local proximity recorded by the Spyglass. We hadn't compared it to a map just yet, but there seemed to be three seperate locations.

Chris leaned closer. “That’s not patrols.”

“No,” Noah said quietly. “That’s intentional travel.”

The coordinates repeated several times at each point. Repeated visits. Two areas had multiple sets of responses, the other seemed less traveled.

Gabs folded her arms. “So you think Ward’s running something off-book?”

“Or ahead of the book,” I said.

I stared at the screen. “One of these is Ethan.”

Silence settled in.

""I promised I wouldn't stop looking..."" I said quietly. ""We're getting him out.""

Finally, Chris exhaled. “Alright. Then we do this clean. Make this air tight, scout the locations, and find our man.”

""What do you have in mind?"" I asked Chris.

The plan was simple. We run our assigned shift as normal. Check the Veil. File reports. Be visible.

Then, when our official workday ended, we get to the real work. We set up our own shop out of the back of a plumbing van Declan suggested. Something mobile and unsuspicious. He disabled the tracking for it and the forestry truck, filing it under his maintenance checklist.

Noah and Gabs worked side by side, each manning a computer and keyboard.

“I can ghost us,” Noah said. “Mask our personal GPS signals. Spyglass will think we’re boring, hanging out at home.”

Gabs smirked. “Good, we don't want anyone to know we are onto them.”

Declan came through clear in our ears. “I’ll stay here at HQ. If something happens, or anybody starts acting up, I'll signal you.”

“Chris and I will hit the sites,"" I said, ""Quietly, if we can help it.”

“And if we can’t?” Chris asked.

My hand rested on my sidearm. “Then we improvise.”

Noah keyed up the first set of coordinates. A familiar stop, with an unfamiliar purpose.

Back out to the forest again. This time it was deeper in, further North where the forest was less traveled and thicker, and yet I felt like we had been circling this space before.

Chris killed the engine a quarter mile out. We went in on foot, pushing through the underbrush of a forgotten trail until the trees thinned just enough to reveal a clearing.

We both stopped behind the trees when we saw it.

“Well,” Chris muttered, “that’s not normal.”

The air itself was wrong. Not a tear, at least nothing active, but the space ahead looked fractured. Light bent oddly, splitting and rejoining in thin, prismatic lines, like a spiderweb made of glass hanging in the air.

The Veil had been worked here. A lot.

I crouched, scanning the ground. “Tire tracks. Unlike a truck. ATV maybe. There's footprints. Heavy, repeated travel."" I said, pointing out the prints and tracks coming and going.

Chris kicked at the dirt. “Someone brought equipment in. More than once.”

He reached down and picked something up between two fingers. A screw. Clean metal. Machined with a flat point.

Chris moved a few steps away, brushing leaves aside with his hand. “Stripped wires. Trimmed ends, with some red and blue insulation. The tips look burnt.”

Scattered under the leaves and pine needles were several spent shell casings. I picked one up. High caliber rounds were fired here.

We shared the same look.

“This wasn’t containment, exactly.” Chris said.

I turned back to the fractured air.

""Noah, are you getting anything?""

This place felt… tired. Overused. Like a muscle strained too many times without rest.

Chris held up a small device with an antenna attached, aiming it at the center.

Over comms, Noah’s voice came in low. “I’m reading Resonate instability all over the place. Its like that spot’s been opened and closed dozens of times.”

He paused then added “It’s not primed to open up, but if someone wanted to push it again…”

“It might shatter,” Chris finished.

I adjusted my hat, eyes fixed on the shimmering cracks. They hadn’t been simply closing the Veil here, It was a testing site.

""They must have been hiding these readings somehow"" Chris said, ""this would have absolutely been a huge red flag to Spyglass.""

""If they have been working the Veil that hard,"" Declan's voice came through, ""Then it's no wonder the other tears were getting worse.""

""Ripples in the pond,"" I thought.

“Log everything,” I said. “We move to the next coordinates.”

As we turned back into the trees, I noticed out of the corner of my eye the fractured light shimmered once, subtly, almost like a breath being taken.

Whoever was here stressed the Veil, making it unstable and our efforts elsewhere ineffective. What could you gain from stress testing a broken window?

The second set of coordinates repeated around a building back in the city along the Northwest side.

From the outside, it was nothing special.

A low concrete structure tucked behind a strip of storage units and an old tire shop. Fadsignage suggested this used to be several things over the years, but nobody came or went now.

No cameras visible from the road. The place where the name used to be over the door was faded and gone now, just a faint outline of lettering.

Chris stood beside me. “It certainly fits the bill for something we might set up and use, but I've never been here.”

I nodded. “Let’s see what’s inside.”

The door gave way easier than it should have.

That was the first bad sign. I looked to Chris and for just a moment, maybe for a half a second, my heart skipped and I saw Paul instead of Chris.

""You okay?"" Chris asked

""Yeah..."" I said pulling out my pistol, ""let's go.""

Chris drew his firearm and we pushed through together.

The front room looked far too clean for an abandoned building, but still carried the feeling of vacancy.

Further in, we found an office setup through a door that was left open. Two desks. A coffee maker with a burnt smell still clinging to it. Clipboards stacked neatly, papers filled with supply checklists. A calendar on the wall. everything was recent, but sat undisturbed.

Someone had left in a hurry.

Chris picked up a half-empty mug. “Still warm-ish.” He placed it back, “They were here recently.”

Nothing screamed secret lab yet. This room was just the paperwork end, pencils before scalpels. Another door sat against the opposite side. We opened it slowly.

The air hit first. It was cold and sterile. Cleaned recently, but not well enough to erase the past.

Metal tables lined the walls. Equipment scavenged from hospitals and research centers, some of it newer than it had any right to be. Power cables snaked across the floor into junction boxes drilled straight into concrete.

Chris stopped short. “This isn’t field triage.”

“No,” I said. “This is set up for full admittance.”

on a cursory glance around, there wasn't a soul in sight. We holstered our weapons, but remained wary of the space around us.

X-rays were clipped to a lightboard. Skeletal images. Human, but wrong in subtle ways. Bone density too high or too low in places. Fractures along the spine and rib cage.

Medical charts covered one wall.

Vitals. Notes. Certain phrases jumped out:

Cellular rejection persists

Stabilizer dependency increasing

Cognitive function remains normal

Chris scrunched his face slightly as he read over the charts. “Looks like they were trying to fix him, whatever happened.”

I said nothing. I wasn't sure what to think, my brain was already stretched thin like a rubber band. My first thought was experimentation, but if they were trying to understand, trying to help him, then that was different. Both options meant lies and secrets.

I remembered what Declan said: ""No one has ever survived going to the other side.""

What happened to you, Ethan?

The area at the back of the room was more disturbing.

There was a large framed box structure at the back corner of the room. Thick panels of glass set into the frame. External locking mechanism. ANCR hardware bolted into the top inside corners. Stabilizers, familiar tech, modified to be set up permanently. One of them was missing, the wires left hanging out of the frame. There was a bed, blankets, a toilet. Comfortable in the way a convict might appreciate.

I stepped inside slowly.

“This isn’t a cell,” I said quietly.

Chris frowned. “Looks like one.”

“It’s a pressure chamber,” I corrected. “This was how they kept him stable.”

Notes were scattered across a desk near the door.

""Subject shows no improvement.

Reversal attempts unsuccessful.

Long-term survival unlikely without continued exposure.""

Our eyes scanned the room, searching for signs of anything. But Ethan wasn’t there.

No blood. No struggle. Only thing missing from the room was the staff and one piece of equipment. Otherwise, it was just an empty space where a man had been treated and housed.

Chris broke the silence. “So, he didn’t escape.”

“No,” I said. “He was moved.”

“I’m not seeing any outbound transport from this site."" Noah chimed in on comms, ""if they took him...”

“They covered their tracks.” I finished.

I looked back at the Stabilizer mounts, the torn cables hanging through them out of the corner. 

""But why move someone who is in that critical a condition?""

Chris glanced around one last time. “So we’ve got a test site, a lab, and a missing man.”

I exhaled slowly. “And someone willing to keep pushing even after the damage was clear.”

The room felt colder than it should have.

“Let’s move,” Derek said. “Before whoever cleared this place realizes we’re onto them.”

As we stepped back into the sunlight, the building returned to what it had always pretended to be. Nothing worth noticing.

Noah’s voice came through the comms as we got into the truck, quieter than usual.

“I’ve got it. Third GPS hit just lit up when I cross-referenced the scrubbed data with the map.”

He paused.

“Decommissioned radio station,” Noah continued. “the coordinates track along where a maintenance tunnel goes underground.”

Chris glanced over. He didn't say anything. He didn't have to.

My hands tightened on the wheel. “That’s the one.” I nodded.

...The entrance was exactly as I remembered it. Just as I left it.

A square concrete doorway that angled down into the ground. I stood there staring at the worn, green metal door with the AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY sign stamped on the front. A chain with a lock had been cut off and tossed around the corner. I felt a chill seep into my bones that held me frozen in place. I swallowed, my throat dry, distracting me from Chris' presence as he walked up to me.

He stopped beside me on my left. “Hey.”

I looked over.

“I’ve got you,” Chris said, simple and solid. “You're not going back in alone. Not this time.”

I looked him in the eye for a moment and nodded “Let’s do this.”

The air below was cold and stale, carrying the familiar faint metallic tang of old wiring and damp stone. Our boots echoed softly against concrete as we moved deeper, our gun-mounted lights cutting through the shadows down branching corridors.

The same old conduit and water lines ran along the walls. Same thick cable channels disappeared into the dark, some still humming faintly with residual power rerouted decades ago. Same faint tapping of dripping water somewhere in the dark. Each step felt heavy as we made our way down the main tunnel. I slowed to a stop about halfway, aiming my light on the concrete floor, illuminating a spot that had a darker stain.

Chris muttered, ""It was here, wasn't it?""

I didn’t answer.

Chris tried the comms but received only static, ""Must be interference from the utilities.""

""Just like before."" I muttered, getting a tighter grip on my pistol.

We checked through several doors.

Heavy steel ones. Utility access rooms. Emergency bulkheads meant to compartmentalize damage. Each one was stamped with faded city markings and numbers that hadn’t mattered in decades.

Every door I opened felt like another layer being peeled away.

“This place is a maze.” Chris muttered. “You could lose a small army down here.”

“That’s the idea.” I said. “No one comes down here unless something’s already gone wrong.”

The last bulkhead opened into a much larger chamber.

Concrete walls stained by time and mineral runoff. Thick water mains as wide as tree trunks ran along the ceiling, branching off in multiple directions, each marked with old district codes. Valves the size of car tires lined the walls. Pressure gauges sat frozen at unreadable numbers. Lights were arranged around the room for illumination.

This was the city’s circulatory system. And it had been repurposed.

Crates were stacked near the entrance. Black equipment cases, most of them empty. We recognized them immediately.

“Those are ours,” Chris said quietly, “from HQ.”

Automatic rifles leaned against one crate, neatly arranged. Extra vests. Power cells. Rations. This was a safehouse.

We became aware we weren't the only ones in the room when we heard a faint humming coming from the side. We stepped down and checked to the left... and there he was.

Ethan sat in the far corner of the room, under a blanket on a chair where the concrete was cleaner and drier. Someone had cleared the space deliberately. Two bottles of water and an MRE sat on a stool next to his chair.

A stabilizer unit stood in front of him on a tripod, angled towards him. The device emitted a low, steady hum, constant and controlled. A battery pack was wired to it and taped onto the outside.

No shimmer. No visible distortion. Just the faint sense that the air there behaved differently.

Ethan looked… thinner. Paler.

Dark circles sat beneath his eyes, and his shoulders slumped with exhaustion. He looked like someone who hadn’t slept properly in years.

When he lifted his head and saw me, he froze.

For a moment, he didn’t speak. His expression cracked with recognition. Not fear, not shock, but something closer to disbelief.

“…Derrick?” he said quietly.

I swallowed. “Yeah, it's me. I'm here.”

A faint, breathless laugh escaped Ethan. “I thought… I thought you stopped looking.”

“Not a chance."" I stepped closer. ""I'm sorry I took so long.”

Tears started to well up in his eyes, but he blinked them away. “Guess I should’ve known better. You never gave up on dad.”

Chris stayed back, giving us space.

Ethan shifted slightly, wincing, some from pain, but also fatigue. “You shouldn’t be here. This place isn’t...”

“Safe?” I finished. “That ship sailed a while ago, buddy.”

A smile stretched his tired face.

I glanced at the stabilizer. “Is it helping?”

“It keeps things… comfortable,” Ethan said. “Without it, everything hurts, like I'm on fire.”

“They told you they could fix this?”

Ethan looked down. “They tried... Caleb told me a lot of things.”

""Caleb?"" I thought.

Before I could say anything further, a slow clapping echoed from the doorway.

“Well, well,” a familiar voice called, “if it isn’t Secret Squirrel and his sidekick.”

We turned toward the door

Richard Payne stepped into the chamber, boots crunching softly against the concrete. Aviators hung from his collar. Mustache immaculate. That same smug tilt to his mouth.

Beside him... Ward.

He moved calmly, hands relaxed at his sides. His eyes swept the room once, assessing the scene. No surprise. No anger. Just calm.

Behind them stood three armed personnel in black uniforms and tactical vests. Faces forgettable, expressions disciplined.

Payne grinned wider. “Gotta admit, Ward called it. Said you'd sniff this place out sooner or later.”

Ward’s gaze settled on me. “I didn't think you would come back here, after what happened.” he said evenly. “But I prepared for it.”

Chris shifted his stance in our direction.

Ward glanced briefly at Ethan, then back to me. “Don't worry, he will be safe here.”

Ethan didn’t look up.

""And slowly dying because of your interferance.” I said quietly.

Ward’s expression didn’t change.

“No,” he replied, “he’s dying because the Veil exists at all.”

Chris moved instantly, stepping over beside us with a hand on his pistol.

Ward raised one hand, “That won’t be necessary.”

His eyes went to me, steady and unreadable.

“I wondered how long it would take you,” Ward said, “you always did notice patterns faster than most.”

I clenched my jaw. “Where’s the Director?”

“He isn’t part of this.” Ward said. “Never was.”

I wasn't sure if I should be relieved to hear that.

“What does that mean?” I asked. “You went over his head?”

Ward shook his head slightly. “No. I went around him. The Director manages response. Damage control. Optics.” He paused. “This requires resolution.”

Chris laughed, sharp and humorless. “You don’t get to decide that.”

Ward looked at him then, really looked at him. “You’re wrong,” he said calmly, “I do. Someone has to.”

He nodded once.

Two soldiers stepped in fast while the third kept a rifle trained on us. Chris reacted, but they were too fast. One stuck him in front, knocking the wind out of him and the other tazed him as he went down. They took his pistol once he was on the ground. I called after him and attempted to move to his aid, but the gunman shifted closer, aiming the rifle squarely at me. A warning, so I backed down.

“Take him upstairs.” Ward said, voice even. “Secure him. No unnecessary force.”

They picked him up and carried him out of the doorway. The other uniformed soldier and Payne followed them out.

Then he was gone.The room felt smaller without him. Just the three of us now.

I turned back to Ward. “You didn’t have to do that.”

“Yes,” Ward said, “I did. We both know he's resourceful.""

Silence stretched between us, thick with the hum of Ethan's stabilizer and distant echoes in the tunnels beyond.

I spoke next, slowly. “You scrubbed the logs. Hid the data. You knew we’d come looking.”

Ward nodded once. “I counted on it.”

“Why?” I asked. “Why not just settle your plans and disappear?”

“Because,” Ward said, “I needed you to see this.”

He gestured to Ethan. To the stabilizer. To the room itself.

“This is the cost of hesitation,” Ward continued, “of treating the Veil like something we can manage indefinitely. Patch after patch. Breach after breach.""

I shook my head. “You don’t know that. We’re learning...”

“We’re stalling,” Ward cut me off, not sharply, but firmly, 

“and people are paying for it. Samantha paid for it. Ethan. Others will too.”

His voice softened, just a fraction.

“I won’t let this continue.”

I felt the weight of it then. Not madness. Not cruelty. This was conviction, and resolve.

“What are you going to do, Caleb?”

Ward stepped back toward the door. “Finish it. For good. One last time.”

He stepped out and began to close the door. I noticed then there was no latch on the inside.

“You’re sealing us in here?” I demanded.

Ward shook his head. “Securing you. There’s a difference.”

He looked at Ethan, then to me.

“You’ll be safe,” Ward said, “the stabilizer will hold for Ethan until we are done.”

“And when you are?"" I asked, ""what then?” 

Ward paused, hand resting on the door.

“When I’m done,” he said, “there won’t be anything left to interfere with. No more stalling. No more breaches.”

He looked at us one last time.

“I truly hoped you’d understand.”

The door sealed shut with a metallic clang.

The locks finished squeaking closed as the wheel turned, and the chamber settled into a new silence, leaving just me and Ethan alone together. I had finally found him, and ended up sealed away myself in the process, with no way out and no way to call for help.",1,1769623933.0,TheMidnightArchives,0,1.0,False

so i was in a relationship, im 24M she’s 25F, so it started in 2024, at first things were good, she’s a lawyer and i was btech 3rd year student. so whatever like one month after we started having clashes over silly things, somewhere i thought it was my fault somewhere her, but things got really dark after some time. im getting into that. so in late october 2024 we both decided to move to a flat together, before the night of moving to our new flat, i went to her flat to help her with packaging and stuffs, so after i reached we started packing up things, then she went to bathroom and i noticed an unknown guy texting her and it was two frequent, i confronted her that what’s happening then she was resisting to show me chats but i cried a hell out and finally she showed and i saw like not to explicit but chats were very very like yk “**cheesy**” whatever we had argument over it and i somehow controlled myself for that night, then next morning we moved into our new flat, i still wasn’t over that incident, but she was complaining why am i being sad , its a new start , so i told her at least give me some days to process. so that day we had arguments again, but outta nowhere she started slapping me continuously…. i mean you all guys can call me a coward like why was i getting beaten up but idc im raised like this… so eventually i forgave her. but things aren’t done yet, some months later on 2025 july, my mother was sick and admitted to hospital, and i was very low… we had a fight but still i called her to share things but she didn’t pick up. and when she got yo know her first expression was how would she know, that got me mad like if you don’t pick up the call how can you know!!! i was blocked from the text platforms also. so whatever we were having a fight over that, and suddenly she said that her female best friend said that she’s settling for less, that got me very mad i gave out a slang about her best friend, and she replied that **”your mother should die”** that left me broken in pieces…. and that day at evening i saw her going out with her make best friend’s car. then she came back after some days and asked for forgiveness and cried… i again forgave her. in august she told me she wanted to leave the flat, she’s done with the relationship… after she heard that i got diagnosed with brain aneurysm. that time i couldn’t process anything like what’s really happening. i begged her to stay and what’s the reason for breaking up, she said we’re not compatible, then we gave the landlord prior notice. then to take my things i went to the flat like a surprise visit, and saw a guy with her both were sipping coffee, the guy was drinking coffee and that was my cup. i was speechless, i couldn’t speak or say a word. she started crying like hell, that guy left after some time, and i made her sit on a chair and asked her politely that why did she do that? she replied i made her lke this, that her feelings faded away. so that day i took all of my belongings and cane back home. idk it’s been like 6 months, i notice that she’s enjoying her life, but its really like i can’t explain how i feel. or mybe i don’t feel anything at all. idk but thing were so pure for me, i really had a dream to live the entire life with her that’s why i chose to move in together. whatever things went wrong so bad. everyday i feel like shit for letting myself down like this. she used to physically abuse me many times, it was just the main two events that i shared. sorryy it’s a bit longer….



TL;DR:

I (24M) was in a relationship with a 25F lawyer that started well in 2024 but quickly turned toxic. After moving in together, I discovered she was emotionally involved with other men and later experienced repeated physical and emotional abuse. During a time when my mother was hospitalized, she showed no support and said something deeply cruel about my mother. Despite multiple red flags, apologies, and forgiveness, she eventually ended the relationship, even after I was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. I later found her with another man in our shared flat. It’s been six months since the breakup; she seems happy, while I feel emotionally numb, broken, and regretful for staying so long in an abusive relationship.",1,1769623904.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

https://craftandcocktails.co/2018/09/02/pineapple-clarified-milk-punch-how-to-clarify-cocktails/

# Recipe 

( I used half of the original measurements because I didn’t want to make a huge batch in case it didn’t worked, I also tweaked some other little steps/ ingredients based on other stuff I read)

You need to prepare this in advance as the whole process takes 4h for infusion + clumping then at least 2-3h for filtering.

**Ingredients**

8 oz brandy

8 oz rum

peels of 2 lemons

1 nutmeg, chopped

1 cinnamon sticks, chopped

1 whole star anise, chopped

4 oz lemon juice

4 oz pineapple juice

1/2 cup of sugar

8 oz water

3 oz 2% milk

3 oz 15% cream

1tbsp black leaves tea ( I used Nepal black tea from David’s tea)

**How to**

\- In a large bowl, combined the brandy, the rhum, the lemon peels and the chopped spices. Let infuse for 2hrs minimum

\- When the infusion is ready, continue with the next steps

\- Combine boiling water and the tea leaves, let infuse for 3 minutes. Strained when ready.

\- While the tea is infusing, put the sugar, the pineapple juice and the lemon juice in a bowl. Add the strained tea to the mix. Stir until sugar dissolves. - Let rest for 15-20 min so it cools off a bit

\- Strain the spirits infusion and add it to the juice/tea mix

\- In another bowl, put the cold cream and milk

\- Add the cocktail mix to the milk/cream slowly. Stir gently

\- Let the mix rest in the fridge for 1-2h so the clumps can form nicely

\- Cover the inside of a strainer with coffee filters to filter the final mix. You have to be patient, my mixture took several hours to fully pass through.

\- Optionally, you can filter a second time when putting it in a bottle by using a coffee filter in a funnel

\- Keep in the fridge! It keeps well

\- Serve over lots of ice with a lemon peel garnish

\- Cheers! ",2,1769623874.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

# ⚙️ Phase 3: The Automation & Trust Layer (Feb 15 - Mar 1)

* **Rules Engine:** ""If Merchant contains 'Starbucks', apply tag `#Coffee`."" Automate the cleanup so you don't have to bulk-edit every week.
* **Live Usage Transparency:** A dashboard showing *exactly* what your API costs are in real-time. (e.g., ""Feb API Cost: $0.38""). Full visibility into the ""Gas"" fee.
* **Smart Onboarding:** A guided flow to get your accounts connected and categories mapped in < 2 minutes.

She was snowed in and my boss was forcing her to come return a key, and if she didn’t my boss was gonna withhold her paycheck. Besides that; there’s so many healthcode violations in that place I could go on and on. I don’t know how this place manages to pass inspection. We have rust in our one fridge that falls on most of our food. She leaves muffins out for multiple days to the point where they’re rock hard and she still tries to sell them. She’ll refuse to throw away wilted spinach, moldy tomatoes or even moldy onions. She also very rarely cleans the espresso machine and im just about the only one that wipes down our front counter and door knobs. There is very little sense of food safety and just safety in general.

1qpiyz9,https://v.redd.it/4uat2pphr4gg1,Rattling near PCV & misfire Iin 2012 civic DX,"So long story short, it sat for a few weeks but I usually took it for a shot across town every week. Got in it, got up the road going for a coffee, check engine starts flashing. Back home. Get there, couldn't tell it was missing until I walked around and heard the exhaust. Ran some codes, all that shows up is my usual bank 1 sensor 2 code and a cylinder 4 misfire listed three times, and the same if I clear and check again. Checked the oil and was about 3/4 low so I topped it up. There also seems to be an exceptional amount of blowby from the oil fill and the misfire gets worse if I leave the cap open for more than a few seconds.

I got out, and as soon as I grabbed the latch under the hood I hear a rattling start. Couldn't tell that day because my ears were all messed up from the cold, but I'm certain now it's in the PCV area. Pulled the valve, little gunky but the ball moves freely. Ran some carb cleaner through it, stuck it back in, no change. All I can describe it as sounding like is as if a chain were grinding on a piece of plastic, yet it sounds like its outside of the engine so I'm ruling out a chain guide, there's no initial rattle so I'm ruling out the tensioner, and whatever it is is causing a misfire in #4. 

It runs fine the first cold start of the day, then after about 15 seconds it slowly starts to miss and rattle again.

It's a 2012 civic DX with an R18Z1.

In the video I noticed it sounds a little louder near the alternator but that could just be me.

I'd rather check here before I try out a coil pack which I can't even see why that would cause the rattle. Can't figure anything else personally, unless it's something else in the PCV system.",1,1769623597.0,MechanicAdvice,2,1.0,False

* **Cocina Rosita** (Valladolid): quesadilla de longaniza and sope de frijol with a drink. 115 pesos. Loved this place in San Juan. Handmade tortillas.
* **Taquería—Unsure of Name** (near Valladolid): We got this delivered and nobody actually remembers the name of the place. But two orders of al pastor and one of alambre, each order providing about five good-sized tacos. Handmade tortillas. No picture because I was ravenous. 180 pesos total.
* **El Poch de Huach** (Merida): We don't get into Merida until about 11pm and since it's Wednesday, lots of places were closed. Two gringas de arrachera and four tacos al pastor and drinks. Pretty good. 487 pesos. 
* **Loncheria—Unsure of Name** (Kanasin): After finishing up an early-morning appointment in Kanasin, stopped at this place before heading back to Valladolid. Eggs for me, torta, panucho, and salbut for husband. It was fine. 210 pesos. 
* **Tacos de canasta, outside OXXO on Calle 41** (Valladolid): She was out of frijol so I asked for the last potato one and she convinced me to also grab a chicharron prensado. They were meh, have had better but she was sweet. 20 pesos.
* **Taquería La Bocadita** (Valladolid): Torta de lomitos, two tacos de lomitos, and two de lechón. The lechon was better than the lomitos. 163 pesos.
* **Churros Pavin** (Valladolid): Churro de cajeta, delicious as always. Pavin never lets us pay but luckily his younger brother was there, who I don't know, so 50 pesos.
* **Mercado 41** (Valladolid): tacos and lemonade. Yuck to the service and the food. Wonder if this is a front for money laundering as it was not good at all. 395 pesos. 
* **Cochinita pibil** (near Valladolid): The best I've ever had. Cooked in the pib for about 16 hours. Fed about 60 people, maybe more, with a good amount left over. 
* **Carne asada & longaniza** (near Valladolid): I was thrilled to hear we'd be having carne asada as I wasn't sure I could consume any more port. Surprise, the meat was PORK! It was still delicious. Someone also gifted me with about three kilos of longaniza so I had him grill that too. Delicious and they also sell it at the Mercado Municipal in Valladolid.
* **Recalentado** (near Valladolid): Before we head to the Caribbean coast to fly out, we have some more of the leftover cochinita from the day before. Still delicious. More than likely it hadn't been refrigerated but I did not ask. 

So, so much pork. Valladolid has a vast (for the city's size) culinary scene but we typically go for regional food and end up at places for convenience, rather than choosing them as a destination. 

There's also a coffee shop practically on every corner now but we visited The Bike House several times since it was close to our lodging. And it was delicious!

I (35F) disclosed financial infidelity to my partner (33M) (hiding and lying about spending / financial details) late last year. I understand why this hurt him and damaged trust, and I take responsibility for it. I’m genuinely committed to repairing things and not repeating old patterns.

For additional context: last year I wasn’t showing up well in our relationship. I was dealing with a major depressive episode, multiple personal traumas, and what I now know was undiagnosed ADHD. That doesn’t excuse the financial infidelity, but it does help explain why my functioning and follow-through were inconsistent at the time. Since then, I’ve been actively engaged in therapy, have made meaningful progress, and am now starting medication for ADHD.

Since disclosure, I’ve been trying to show consistency through behaviors that feel concrete and observable to me, including:

	•	budgeting and not overspending

	•	taking on and following through with shared responsibilities and chores

	•	being more structured and routine-oriented

	•	pausing instead of acting impulsively

	•	communicating more clearly when I can’t complete something on time

	•	taking better care of my physical and mental health

Some of these things are a process of trying to figure out new ways of engaging. But the core pieces I have consistently been fully successful are showing up equitably and budgeting/financial goals.

My partner has shared that consistency is his main non-negotiable for rebuilding trust. He’s asked me to identify very concrete, observable behaviors that I can consistently do so he can “see the progress” (for example, things like no social media or even things like not drinking coffee). (Context for coffee: I realized I wasn’t enjoying the taste of the coffees I was making, I was trying other morning drinks but wanted to retry coffee but a new way but still equitable price if not cheaper than what I was doing). (Context for social media: it has been a trigger and working with my therapist I was trying re-exposure to mixed results, no impulses or shopping yay!, but it does consume my mind a lot, I am finding I am needing a lot of mental stimulation and trying to figure out what that is).

I understand the desire for predictability and reassurance after trust has been broken. Where I’m struggling is that when consistency becomes about tracking or monitoring very specific behaviors—especially ones that don’t directly relate to finances—it starts to feel overwhelming and dysregulating for me. I worry that it turns the dynamic into one where I’m being evaluated rather than where trust is slowly rebuilt. I also worry about the ramifications of the process of trying to find balance.

I’ve tried suggesting other ways to show consistency, such as shared check-ins, reviewing finances together, or discussing progress in therapy. At this point, my partner isn’t open to reviewing finances and has expressed doubts about whether things like chores or day-to-day responsibilities are really being done, even when I believe they are observable.

I’m not trying to avoid accountability, and I know trust repair takes time. I’m just feeling stuck and unsure how to move forward when the changes I’m making don’t seem to register, and the request for monitoring feels hard for me to tolerate long-term.

Some questions I’m hoping for insight on:

	•	What does healthy trust repair after financial infidelity actually look like in practice?

	•	Are concrete behavior changes helpful, and how do couples decide which behaviors matter most?

	•	How do you balance accountability and transparency without creating a monitoring or surveillance dynamic?

	•	At what point does trust repair also require engagement or effort from the injured partner?

1qpiu15,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qpiu15/aita_for_divorcing_my_wife_after_her_apple_watch/,AITA for divorcing my wife after her Apple Watch exposed 4 months of 'therapy appointments' at her affair partner's apartment and she called ME controlling for finding out?,"I found out my wife was cheating because her Apple Watch ratted her out on our shared iPad.

Last Tuesday I was playing a game on the iPad when a notification popped up. ""Workout complete - 47 minutes, average heart rate 142 bpm."" Weird, because my wife wasn't home. She left three hours ago for her ""therapy appointment"" like she does every Thursday at 1:30.

I opened the fitness app. The workout location showed an address I didn't recognize. I put it in Maps. Some apartment complex twenty minutes from our house.

My stomach dropped but I told myself there had to be an explanation. Maybe her therapist moved offices. Maybe the location was glitching. But then I scrolled back through her workout history.

Every single Thursday for the past four months. Same location. Same time window. Heart rate always spiking between 125-150 bpm for 30-60 minutes.

I checked her calendar. ""Therapy appointment"" blocked out from 2-3 PM every Thursday.

That's when I got really sick. Because her actual therapist's office is downtown, and I've picked her up from there before when her car was in the shop. I had the address saved in my phone. Different place entirely.

I didn't confront her when she got home that Thursday. I just watched her walk in at 4:15, all showered and refreshed, hair still damp. She kissed me on the cheek and asked what I wanted for dinner.

""How was therapy?"" I asked.

""Good,"" she said. ""Really productive session. We talked about my anxiety around work stuff.""

I nodded and ordered pizza. Didn't say anything else.

The next Thursday I told my boss I had a dentist appointment and left work at 1:00. I drove to that apartment complex and parked where I could see the entrance. At 1:52 PM my wife's car pulled in. She parked, checked her phone, fixed her hair in the mirror.

At 1:58 PM a guy walked out of the building. Mid-thirties, fit, wearing gym clothes. He got in her car.

They sat there talking for a minute. Then he leaned over and kissed her. Not a peck. A full, open-mouth kiss that lasted long enough that I had to look away.

They got out and went into the building together. His hand was on her lower back.

I sat in my car shaking. I didn't know what to do. Part of me wanted to storm in there. Part of me wanted to drive away and pretend I never saw it. Instead I just waited.

Her Apple Watch synced at 2:34 PM. ""Workout started.""

I started laughing. Couldn't help it. The whole thing was so stupid and obvious once you knew what you were looking at.

At 3:47 PM they came out. He kissed her again by her car. She was glowing, smiling in a way I hadn't seen in months. She got in her car and left. He went back inside.

I drove home and got there before her. When she walked in at 4:20 I was sitting at the kitchen table with the iPad open to her fitness app.

""How was therapy?"" I asked.

She froze when she saw the screen. Her face went white.

""I can explain,"" she said.

""Your heart rate hit 156 today,"" I said. ""That's pretty intense for a therapy session.""

She started crying. The whole story came out in pieces. His name was Tyler, they met at her gym six months ago, it started as just coffee, then it became more, she never meant for it to happen, she was going to end it, she loved me, it didn't mean anything.

""You scheduled him in your calendar as therapy,"" I said. ""You've been doing this for four months. You looked me in the eye every Thursday and lied.""

""I'm sorry,"" she sobbed. ""I'm so sorry. It was a mistake. We can fix this.""

""I watched you kiss him today,"" I said. ""I followed you. I sat in the parking lot and watched you go into his apartment.""

Her face changed. The crying stopped. ""You followed me?""

""Yeah,"" I said. ""Seemed like the thing to do when your wife's fitness tracker shows her having sex at the same apartment every week.""

""That's psychotic,"" she said. ""You invaded my privacy.""

I actually laughed. ""Your privacy. Right.""

She got angry then. Said I was controlling, that I had trust issues, that following her was abusive behavior, that maybe this was why she needed to find connection elsewhere. She turned the whole thing around on me like I was the problem.

""Get out,"" I said.

""This is my house too,"" she said.

""Then I'll leave,"" I said. I grabbed my keys and walked out.

I stayed at my brother's place that night. She texted me 47 times. Calling, apologizing, then getting angry again when I didn't respond, then apologizing more. The next morning she showed up at my brother's house.

""We need to talk,"" she said.

""Talk to a divorce lawyer,"" I said. ""I already did.""

She lost it. Started screaming in my brother's driveway about how I was throwing away our marriage over nothing, how it was just physical, how she chose me every day by coming home. My brother came out and told her to leave.

She called her mom. Her mom called me and said I was being dramatic, that all marriages go through rough patches, that I should be willing to work on things instead of giving up. When I told her what actually happened she went quiet.

""Oh,"" she said. ""I didn't realize it was... I thought you two just had a fight.""

""She's been cheating on me for months,"" I said. ""She had him scheduled in her calendar.""

Her mom didn't really have a response to that.

I filed for divorce the following Monday. My wife tried to convince me to do counseling instead. Said she'd cut off all contact with Tyler, that it was already over, that she'd do whatever it took. I told her I didn't want to be married to someone who could lie to my face every week for four months.

She told everyone I was leaving her over a mistake. That I refused to even try to save the marriage. Her friends reached out telling me I was being harsh, that people mess up, that love means forgiveness.

But here's the thing. It wasn't a mistake. It was 16+ calculated decisions over four months. It was lying every Thursday and then coming home and asking what I wanted for dinner like nothing happened. It was syncing her affair to our shared iPad and not even noticing.

Tyler apparently has a girlfriend too. I found her on social media and sent her screenshots of the fitness app data. She deserved to know. My almost-ex-wife called me cruel for that. Said I was trying to blow up Tyler's life out of spite.

Last week my wife finally moved out. She's staying with her mom. She took half our stuff and left me a note saying she hoped I'd realize what I was giving up, that real love isn't perfect, that I'd regret walking away from someone who really knew me.

I deleted the note.

But now I'm second-guessing myself. People keep saying marriage takes work, that everyone makes mistakes, that I'm throwing away years together over something that could be fixed. Her mom said I'm being stubborn and prideful. My own mom said I should at least hear her out.

AITA for not even trying to work through this?

SELF-confessed “secret eater” Emilly Murray weighed 22st 2lbs and was struggling to squeeze into size 30 clothes.

Now a svelte 9st and size 6, the 35-year-old barely recognises herself in the mirror.

Her incredible slimming success is down to fat jab Mounjaro which she began in late 2024.

Now, she is fitter, her “food noise” has disappeared, and she can finally shop in Zara.

But after reaching 11st last year, she hit the dreaded “Mounjaro plateau” – struggling to shift any more weight on the jab.

Desperate to reach her goal weight of 10 stone, she discovered one simple diet trick turbo-charged her weight loss after progress stalled.

READ MORE ON MOUNJARO[](https://www.thesun.ie/health/15693512/mounjaro-free-nhs-prices-increase-fat-jabs/)

She upped her water intake to two to three litres a day – alongside the amount of meat and fish she consumed.

Emilly, a content creator, from Liverpool, said: “I couldn’t shift the weight over Christmas, and I think that because it is the winter, you are just eating a bit different and you just need to adapt to make it.

“I also think that once your body hits certain weights, it must get comfortable being there, so you just need to find something that can shift it again.

“Water is dead important to remember to drink. I would recommend drinking around two to three litres, that is what I do.[](https://www.thesun.ie/health/16429777/night-sweats-itchy-skin-first-sign-cancer-riddled/)

“In the summer when you are hot and sweaty you tend to drink lots of water, so its important you do this over winter too.

“When you don’t look after your body, it seems to slip a little, and people forget water is a huge part of looking after yourself.”

She added: “Protein is amazing, it keeps you keep full for longer.

“It is better for metabolism, but it is also good all round.

“When you are on the jabs you tend to not only loose fat but muscle mass, and the protein is very good for you.

“I upped the amount of meat and fish I was eating, and I take a lot of creatine powder too.

“I have a raspberry lemonade one that I can take with water.”

Experts say that regularly drinking water reduces hunger as it fills up the stomach.

Research also shows that dehydration can slow down metabolism – the process by which the body turns food and drink into energy – hampering weight loss.

As many as one in five users of GLP-1 drugs fail to see meaningful results.

Others lose weight initially, studies suggest the early progress often slows and, for some, stalls altogether.

Nearly 85 per cent of patients experience a plateau, where weight loss dwindles to a halt.

Emilly's diet: before and now

**BEFORE**

Breakfast – nothing

Lunch – nothing

Dinner – air fryer food or a takeaway

Snacks: chocolate bar, coffee, Doritos, jelly sweets

Drinks: fizzy pop

**AFTER**

Breakfast – clear whey protein, yoghurt, fruit

Lunch – chicken thighs with salad

Dinner – chicken tikka

Snacks: meat, cheese, fruit

Drinks: water or sugar free juice



**Emilly says her weight loss has been mostly positive, but she now finds it painful to sit down**Credit: SWNS

Emilly began her weight loss journey in 2023 when she decided to eat in a calorie deficit (consuming fewer calories than she was burning) and start exercising.

“I’ve got disordered eating; I’m a bit of a binge eater,” Emilly says.

“I was binge eating over the weekend and restricting my calories during the week.

“I wasn’t addressing the issues I had with food.”

Usually only eating one 2,000-calorie meal a day, she would go to the shop in the evening to buy Doritos, a sharing-sized bar of chocolate and a bag of sweets and “eat them all”.

But everything changed when she bought her first Mounjaro weight loss jab for £105 from a private pharmacy in December 2024.

“I’ve never looked back; it’s the best thing I’ve ever done,” Emilly says.

“I’ve never not struggled so much because I’ve not got that constant obsession of thinking about food every minute of every day.

“People talk about ‘food noise’. And when you take Mounjaro and that stops, it’s like mental clarity.

But there have been several negatives to shedding half her body weight.



**The stay-at-home mum also finds shaving her armpits strange as they are now ‘hollow’**Credit: SWNS

**Most importantly though, her relationship with food has changed for the better**Credit: SWNS

People often comment on Emilly’s weight, she said, and she finds shaving her “hollow” armpits almost impossible.

“I look in the mirror and I still don’t see what other people see,” she said.

“It’s really hard to not feel like the old me. Your brain just doesn’t catch up.

“Lying in the bath is not comfy. Obviously I’m not used to feeling all these bones.

“When I was on holiday I was so uncomfortable on the chairs and the sunbed. My coccyx hurt the most.

“I was obviously that fat before that my bones didn’t touch much.

“I didn’t roll over in bed and feel hip bones and now I do and I’m like, ‘Oh’. It really is uncomfortable.”

As well as having to “acclimatise” to being able to feel her bones now she has lost weight, Emilly still finds buying new clothes “weird” and will often pick out a bigger size.

“I was able to go to Zara and buy clothes,” she says.

**Putting her previous diet down to emotional eating, Emilly said “things got worse” when her daughter was in hospital**Credit: SWNS

“I always remember every winter trying to find a coat that fit me and it was so difficult, there were no options.

“It’s always been such a negative experience, and it’s so nice now that it can be a nice experience.

“I actually stood in the changing room and cried.”

Putting her previous diet down to emotional eating, Emilly said “things got worse” when her daughter was in hospital after being born prematurely and with a rare birth defect.

“It would trigger me to binge; I’d secretly eat,” she added.

“I own my own house but I’d still hide wrappers in the bin. I wouldn’t have breakfast and sometimes skip dinner.

“Now I’ll have a clear whey protein drink, yoghurt and fruit for breakfast, and chicken thighs for dinner.

“I’ll make, for example, a chicken tikka for dinner and have that but it’s all calorie counted and portion controlled.”

“It’s \[Mounjaro’s\] literally changed my life,” she added. “I wish I’d started it earlier.

“It’s not even about losing weight – the most important thing about it is rebuilding your relationship with food.”

**Emilly paid £105 for her first Mounjaro jab and has never looked back**

**Emilly now prioritises balanced, nutritious meals**Credit: SWNS

She added: “I must get hundreds of comments throughout the week saying, ‘Just eat less and move more’. People don’t see obesity as a disease.

“I haven’t lived my life, I’ve always hid away and been miserable.

“When you’ve got people who don’t struggle with their weight giving their opinions, saying you’re ‘cheating’ using medication, is one of the most negative things.

“The risks of obesity are far worse to me than the risk of Mounjaro but when you start Mounjaro everyone wants to say how dangerous it is.

Not because I was rude or weird, just... forgettable. Boring, even.



And honestly? I get it now. Most of us are walking around having the same recycled conversations on autopilot. ""How's work?"" ""Good, you?"" ""Yeah, same."" We've been conditioned to play it safe, be polite, not rock the boat. Problem is, safe equals snooze.



I spent months studying this, pulling from communication research, psychology podcasts, books on charisma. What I found completely changed how I show up in conversations. Not fake tactics or manipulation, just small shifts that make interactions actually enjoyable for everyone involved.



Stop interviewing people. Most ""conversations"" are just interrogations disguised as small talk. You ask a question, they answer, you ask another question. It's exhausting for both sides. Instead, try thread pulling. They mention they went hiking last weekend? Don't just say ""cool, where?"" Share something related first. ""Oh man, I've been wanting to get outdoors more but I always end up doom scrolling instead. What got you into hiking?"" You're creating connection, not conducting an interview.



This concept comes up constantly in Leil Lowndes' ""How to Talk to Anyone"". She's a communication expert who's trained Fortune 500 executives, and this book is stuffed with practical, immediately usable techniques. No fluff about ""be yourself"" nonsense. The sticky eyes technique alone (holding eye contact one beat longer than feels natural) made people start describing me as more ""present"" and ""engaged."" Sounds manipulative but it's literally just being attentive instead of already planning what you'll say next.



React bigger. Your face is probably doing way less than you think during conversations. I started noticing this after listening to Vanessa Van Edwards on the Science of People podcast. She breaks down nonverbal communication research and points out that most people severely underestimate how animated they need to be for others to register genuine interest. Your internal ""wow that's interesting"" needs to show up externally as actual expression. Raise your eyebrows. Lean in slightly. Let your face move. It feels over the top at first but it reads as normal enthusiasm to others.



Say the weird thing. Within reason obviously. But those random observations or semi embarrassing thoughts you filter out? Those are usually the interesting bits. Everyone's thinking something slightly odd during conversations, you're just the only one brave enough to voice it. ""This coffee tastes like someone dissolved a tire in hot water"" is infinitely more memorable than ""this coffee is ok.""



Charlie Houpert's Charisma on Command YouTube channel covers this concept really well in his videos analyzing charismatic celebrities. He breaks down how people like Chris Hemsworth or Jennifer Lawrence say the unexpected thing that makes everyone laugh, while still being likeable. It's not about being shocking, it's about being honest when everyone else is being bland.



Ask about feelings, not just facts. Instead of ""what do you do for work?"" try ""how do you feel about your job?"" The first gets you a job title. The second gets you an actual conversation about whether they're fulfilled, burnt out, plotting an escape. Way more interesting. Research in social psychology shows we bond over emotional content, not information exchange, but somehow we're all out here swapping data like robots.



For anyone wanting to go deeper on this, ""Captivate"" by Vanessa Van Edwards is incredible. She's a behavioral investigator who studies charisma scientifically. The book includes research backed strategies for being more engaging, from conversation starters that actually work to understanding personality matrices. She won the Readers' Favorite Award and her TED talk has millions of views for good reason. Reading this genuinely made me understand why some people are magnetic and others aren't. It's not magic, it's specific learnable behaviors.



If you want a more structured way to work through these concepts without carving out hours for reading, there's an app called BeFreed that might be worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning platform that pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, plus communication research and expert insights, and turns them into personalized audio content. You can set a goal like ""become more engaging in conversations as an introvert"" and it'll build you an adaptive learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes dense psychology concepts way easier to absorb during commutes or gym time. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid and science-based.



Stop waiting for your turn to talk. This was my biggest issue. I'd be ""listening"" but really just queuing up my own story. Actual listening means sometimes you don't get to share your thing, and that's fine. The conversation flows better when you're genuinely curious about their experience rather than using their story as a springboard for yours.



Use callbacks. Remember something specific they mentioned earlier and reference it later. ""Wait, is this related to that thing you said about your sister?"" People feel seen when you're actually tracking the conversation instead of just existing in it.



I also started using Replika oddly enough, not as a friend replacement but as practice for being more present in conversations. It's an AI chatbot that adapts to your communication style. Sounds weird but it helped me notice my patterns, like how often I'd deflect or give surface level responses. Sometimes you need a judgment free space to realize you're kind of bad at this.



Look, you don't need to become a different person. Most of us are interesting, we've just been socialized into being boring. We learned that enthusiasm is cringe, that sharing real thoughts is risky, that small talk is safer than actual connection. But safe is forgettable. And life's too short to be the person people escape from at parties.



The shift isn't about learning tricks. It's about unlearning the habit of playing it safe in every single interaction. Be more honest, more present, more willing to say something that might land weird. That's where the good stuff lives.",1,1769623180.0,SocialBlueprint,0,1.0,False

1qpiquf,https://i.redd.it/fwhzpbx5q4gg1.jpeg,Tier list of tourist groups I've served as a barista on a highway cafe in Greece.,"This doesn't have to do with the people as a whole, just how they treated me and my coworkers as baristas. Explaining below:

S TIER

Japan: Lovely people. They would stand in a line quietly waiting for us to take their order and serve them. The older ladies were adorable and very kind. They don't know english but they're trying their best to let us know what they want.

USA: Very polite people and fun. They treated us with respect and patience. What I noticed is that they NEVER tipped, even if they have a very strong tipping culture. Good people nonetheless, they treated our cafe well.

Romania: Always lovely and polite, especially the elders even if they couldn't communicate. A romanian chick was hitting on me once at work for like half an hour and left me a 9€ tip, which was like 3 hours worth my hourly salary at the time.


A TIER:

Bulgaria: Love our neighbours, nothing but love for them. They were great overall, they just left a mess behind them sometimes and that cost them the S tier.

China: While they reminded me of japanese in terms of how they treated us, sometimes they woukd get angry if they had to wait a bit more to get their order. I never understood what they were saying when angry anyway so oh well. Otherwise very cool people and clean.

Serbia: Orthodox brothers. Never had a bad interaction with them, they were always happy when they would come and there was a mutual feeling of respect. Love them. Same as bulgarians, sometimes they left a mess behind them.


B TIER:

Germany: Always kind and patient. Germans are cool in general. Only at B tier cause there were a couple of incidents of complaints for extremely silly reasons like, once we served a couple the same coffee, and the guy complained because we charged him the lid of the cup and we didn't charge his gf's. The lid was 0.05€... I wish I was lying

UK: Cool people overall and friendly but they'd leave a mess behind them, mainly the younger generations. Would get annoyed if I wasn't able to understand their accent while they were speaking fast. 

Greece: Younger generation is much much better compared to our elders. At B mostly because of 50+ y/o people, who thought that they ran the place and would leave a mess and disrespect us.

Albania: Overall very cool people as well, especially the younger ones that know english. B tier has to do with leaving trash around everywhere too.

Ireland: Read above

Poland: Cool overall but cold people. They would smile and get happy when I'd tell some of them I had a polish gf and throw around some Polish words.



C TIER:

Cyprus: They were snobbish and would get angry when I wouldn't get their dialect sometimes. Sorry mates but when you speak in heavy Cyprian accent all I hear is a mix of Greek and Spanish. Also impatient.

Hungary: Cold, impatient and sometimes rude.

N.Mac: They rarely bought anything, mainly used the place to take a shit. Anyone over 40 didnt know English so it was hard communicating. Younger people were cooler I guess.

France: Snobbish, wouldn't talk in English therefore we couldn't communicate, they expected me to know french I guess. After a while of them not trying to order in English I would reply back in Greek.

D TIER:

Israel: Dang. I'm not racist and that has nothing to do with the war and all, but they were MISERABLE 9 out of 10 times. They would never form lines, they would shout atop each other to order first which helped no-one. They left the place nuked from trash behind them. Sometimes they'd try to get discounts for dumb reasons (spoiler alert: it never worked). And the cherry on top: our espresso was cheaper than cappuccino by 0.80€. The store didnt charge the milk. So they ordered espressos and then they'd ask for ""A lot of milk with a bit of foam""...to make their own cappuccinos. I didn't believe what they were doing. It was unimaginable to me. I like Israelis when I encounter them outside. Never liked Israelis when they came to the store. Oh and another thing. Older people would put THEIR FUCKING hands in the ice creams we had that were away from the counter to have a taste of the different flavours. I couldn't comprehend there are people like these in the outside world. These weren't isolated incidents. They acted like pigs. Not all Israelis at my job were pigs, but the ones that acted like pigs were all Israelis. Sorry neighbours but you have to get better. 

Italy: Yes we make our coffees different. Yes we drink cold espresso with ice. Yes okay, you have better coffee quality in Italy, but I really don't care. I don't complain when I come to Italy and the gyros there tastes like sand. Stop talking Italian I know you can speak English. Get in line, be patient and pick your trash don't leave it behind for me to collect. Your Italian insults are irrelevant to me, Greek insults can be much harsher and sound cooler.",3,1769623146.0,tierlists,0,1.0,False
1qpiq9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1qpiq9u/after_2_years_of_fighting_parents_for_nikkah_i/,"After 2 Years of Fighting Parents for Nikkah, I Ended my Relationship a Couple Days Ago - Dealing with Guilt, Resentment, and Broken Promises","Assalamu alaikum everyone.   
  
This post will be a little long. The wounds are still fresh, and there are a thousand-million things running through my head right now, so I’m putting down my thoughts here and using AI to piece things together coherently. Just to preface: I know I didn’t start in the most halal way, and I will not expose the extent of the sins I committed, just know that we were essentially like a married couple, minus full zina. Yes, I feel religious guilt, and yes, I'm repenting. I'm not looking for insults or i-told-you-so's, I’m looking for proper Islamic advice and stories from others to help me clear my mind.

To start, when I was in college, I met a girl I really liked. She was a hijabi in the MSA, she was pretty, and she had a great personality, so immediately, I fell in love. Background-wise, I’m a Sunni hafiz of the Qur’an, I went to Islamic school before high school, and I’ve never put myself in compromising situations around women. With that being said, for the first couple of years, I stayed away from her.

This all changed my sophomore year, when she and I ended up in the same friend group. From there, our friendship grew naturally: we would study together, get coffee all the time, and I learned a lot about her and her family. She was Shia from a culturally Shia family, had some issues with her dad (lived away from the family for long periods due to work, cheated on her mom before, etc.), but she was a nice person. In hindsight, this was foolish, because I didn’t know I’d be in the situation I’m in today. My parents knew about my friendship with her, and I would tell them everything I knew about her (both the good and bad).

Little by little, we got closer until it got to the point where I needed to see if she liked me. I asked her, and she declined. I was heartbroken, and we cut contact. A couple months passed, and coming back from winter break into the spring semester, we started talking again as friends. We got close again, and I felt the need to ask a second time. Again, she said no. This time I felt the need to really distance myself, and I cut contact the summer going into my junior year. Out of hurt, I would talk to my parents about everything, and they would support me. What I didn’t realize was how this would come back and affect me later.

Coming back from that summer, we started talking and getting closer again—except this time it felt different on her end. To make a long story short: we went on a date, we confessed our feelings, and she told me no guy had ever cared about her the way I did. We made it official. From that point onwards, we were together.

Despite being together, our relationship wasn’t the smoothest at first. Because it was a haram relationship, we struggled with boundaries, got into fights due to religious conflicts, and had petty arguments. Eventually, it became like a situationship—where I was fully invested while she seemed distant at times. But we eventually smoothed things out.

Before going into the relationship, we made it clear we couldn’t get married unless one of us converted. We both did our research, and she decided she wanted to become Sunni. It took her around 8–9 months of research until she decided to convert. During this time, she started having a lot of conflict with her parents. They were very overbearing, and it got to the point where they were going to force her to marry a Shia guy she didn’t want. Her father even called my number and told me to stay away from his daughter and family, saying a Sunni–Shia marriage would never work and that I was the reason all of this was happening. She was a master’s student at the time, and with the remaining loan money she ran away from home, got an apartment, and lived on her own.

In hindsight, that was childish on both sides, but I thought approaching my parents for a nikah at that time would have been the best thing. I was wrong. After explaining the situation to my parents, they blew up at me—calling me names, yelling at me, and saying horrible things about her and her family based on an already negative perception. It got so bad I didn’t talk to my parents for two months. Yet she and I stayed together, hoping to push through. I eventually smoothed things out with my parents, but there was always tension.

A year passed—during which my bond with her strengthened as I saw her character with others and her deen—and then my parents had a sit-down chat with me. Her mom reached out to mine on Facebook, writing a polite message to meet and talk about our relationship. My mom freaked out, ignored her, and refused to meet her family to mend things. Then things got worse: her father called my dad’s workplace and said the same things about keeping me away from his daughter, Sunni–Shia issues, etc. My parents were insulted and became even more firm about not letting us be together.

I had a blowout fight with my family where they slandered her character without knowing her. They said she would become Shia again, we would get divorced, my children would become non-Muslim, etc. They told me they would cut my tuition and kick me out of the house unless I stopped talking to her and ended things. To calm them down, I said okay—but I continued talking to her, hoping I could convince my parents one day and marry her.

Fast-forward another year to the present: alhamdulillah, I got into medical school, and it truly felt like our relationship only got better. We talked extensively about marriage and agreed on morals, family, children—literally everything. She started talking to her family more, and her situation improved: her mom finally accepted her being Sunni, and everything seemed like it was going great. Meanwhile, my parents told me they would never accept my marriage and wanted no part in my life, but they would pay for my living and schooling until residency (which I agreed to). It felt like things might finally happen.

To do things properly, we ended our haram relationship months prior, and I decided to reach out to her mom to talk about the relationship and mend things with her family. When we met, she was appreciative and liked my character. She said she didn’t feel our marriage would work, but she would support her daughter so she would be happy. She said her family had many Sunni–Shia marriages and this would be no different. She also said she would support the marriage and we could raise our family how we desired, and that she would talk to her husband—but only on one condition: she and my mom had to meet, and my mom had to give her blessing. She also made me promise to accept whatever outcome my parents decided, because “parents know what’s best for kids.”

Despite days of praying and making du’a for my parents’ hearts to soften, nights in tahajjud crying for this to happen, dozens of istikharas, and doors seemingly opening—things turned for the worse.

A couple days after that conversation (three days ago), I approached my parents and all hell broke loose. They were yelling, my dad had heart palpitations and nearly fainted, and they told me they would not pay for medical school and to pack up and leave the house. They said her mom was manipulative and only speaking nicely because she wants to win her daughter back—not because she wants us to be married.

This was the worst fight we’ve had, and I was devastated. I tried to reason with them, but there was no reasoning. I tried thinking of ways to pay for medical school or live without taking out loans, but it feels impossible. I tried thinking about how to approach her mom, but she clearly said that if my mom says no, she won’t accept. I talked to multiple shaykhs, and they said that since I don’t have financial means right now, I’m stuck in limbo and can’t advocate for myself in that way.

I felt like I exhausted my avenues, and any other decision would be rash, would set my education back, and would ultimately make our married life miserable. I felt like the world was ending. She’s such a good person, and I didn’t want to drag her along longer with “hope” when the reality might never change. It felt like my istikhara ended at a dead end, with nowhere else to go except more haram.

Because of that, we mutually ended the relationship over text. Even though I’m normally emotionally stable and stoic, I’ll admit: I sobbed all night. Even leading up to today, I haven’t eaten or drank water, and I feel emotionally and physically drained after losing the love of my life.

I have a lot of thoughts, but these are the ones eating me alive:

* Did I do enough to fight for her, or do I have no backbone with my parents? I feel so much guilt, and I don’t want her to think I abandoned her. She truly was the love of my life. I didn’t want to do more haram just to potentially be with her.



* How will I move on? Were we good for each other, and is this Allah testing us for possibly reuniting in a more pure way in the future?



* Is she mad that I didn’t do enough, or will she come to believe I wasn’t good enough for her?



* It feels like my future was pulled away from me. What do I do?



* This situation really hurt my relationship with my parents. How do I ever fix it? Is it even possible?



* I made so many promises to her that I meant sincerely, and in this situation, they were broken. How will she ever forgive me?



* Did I make the right decision, or was I being emotional? Should I have waited longer?



* If we don’t end up together, how will I ever form the same bond I had with her? Will I always compare future spouses to her? Will I even find a spouse after all the wrong I’ve done?

TL;DR: I (24M) was in a relationship with a 25F lawyer that started well in 2024 but quickly turned toxic. After moving in together, I discovered she was emotionally involved with other men and later experienced repeated physical and emotional abuse. During a time when my mother was hospitalized, she showed no support and said something deeply cruel about my mother. Despite multiple red flags, apologies, and forgiveness, she eventually ended the relationship, even after I was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. I later found her with another man in our shared flat. It’s been six months since the breakup; she seems happy, while I feel emotionally numb, broken, and regretful for staying so long in an abusive relationship.",0,1769622997.0,relationships,2,0.33,False

1qpin6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1qpin6s/samesex_db/,Same-Sex DB,"Hello!

My wife (LLF) and I (HLF) have had a DB since shortly after we were married 7 years ago. We are in our late 30s and have one child who is 6. No medical issues.

The last time we were intimate was in August. Once, while our child was on vacation with grandparents for a week.

We are both full-time working professionals but have a very family friendly work schedule. On the outside, we have a lovely life. Great careers, nice home, spend lots of family time together, travel & so on.

Since my job is more flexible than hers, I do most of the housework inside & out. I clean, perform maintenance, cook a majority of the meals, and all of the planning that comes with it. Lawn care, snow, etc. I take care of it. She takes care of laundry and school lunches exclusively. I don’t mind this, as it works for us. I only say this because her physical/mental load at home is not heavy & isn’t the reason for our DB which I know can be the case in some relationships.

I think of the small things. I’ll get her coffee ready, switch her bath towel, fix her something to eat when she’s in between meetings. I’ll clean the snow off her car and warm it up before she has to leave, shovel her a path to her car door first.

Any “talks” about our DB turn into her becoming defensive and angry & she just waits for me to be out of the funk I’m in until the next time I can’t push the emotions down.

Me: “I feel like I just exist for you, and am not seen or prioritized.” Or “I feel like you are not in love with me” or “I am deeply lonely” and every other feeling you can imagine that comes with a DB. A lot of it is me asking why? What is wrong with me?

Her responses: “oh great you’re at it again because you’re trying to initiate, I’m saying no like I always do because I have no interest in doing that, and you start getting bitchy and angry with everyone” (I don’t, I just sometimes retreat into myself and become quiet/a woman of few words - which is “bitchy” to her)

Or “if you honestly feel this way then why do you stay?

Or “I have nothing to fix. If you are unhappy then make yourself happy, stop trying to make me feel like shit”

All of this leads me to conclude that I don’t matter to her and if I can’t accept her lack of desire, I should leave as she refuses to see it as an issue and work towards a resolution. 

I don’t know what else to do. She has this wall up and it’s indestructible. 

Can anyone resonate with this and share their experience/thoughts?

This resource explains which restaurant fundraising ideas raise the most money, how to choose restaurants that offer fundraising programs, and how to promote events to increase participation and long-term success.*

People are far more willing to support a fundraiser when it fits naturally into their daily lives. That is why restaurant fundraisers continue to outperform so many traditional efforts year after year. Instead of selling products door-to-door or asking for direct donations, you invite supporters to do something they already enjoy. They eat a meal, spend time together, and your organization earns money in the process.

When fundraising at restaurants is done well, it feels effortless for supporters and highly rewarding for organizers. We have seen schools, churches, teams, and community groups raise meaningful funds in a single evening simply by choosing the right restaurant, communicating clearly, and treating the event like it matters.

What follows is a closer look at restaurant fundraising ideas that consistently raise the most money, why they work, and how to run them to maximize results without exhausting your volunteers.

# Key Highlights

* Restaurant fundraisers convert everyday meals into real funding
* Clear communication drives higher participation
* The best restaurant fundraisers combine strong promotion with simple rules
* Restaurants that offer fundraising programs succeed when aligned with the audience
* Consistency builds long-term fundraising momentum

# Why Restaurant Fundraisers Consistently Perform

Restaurant fundraisers succeed because they remove the most common barriers to participation. Supporters do not need to buy something unfamiliar or spend extra money. They simply redirect a meal they were already planning to purchase.

There is also a psychological advantage. People are more comfortable spending money when they receive something tangible in return. A meal feels like value, not obligation. That shift in mindset dramatically increases participation.

From our experience, restaurant fundraisers also benefit from familiarity and trust. When supporters recognize the restaurant name, they feel confident their purchase counts and that the fundraiser is legitimate. That confidence leads to higher turnout and stronger word of mouth.

Timing plays a role as well. Restaurant fundraisers fit neatly into evenings, weekends, and existing routines. One well-promoted event can outperform weeks of selling, especially when supporters feel no pressure to participate beyond enjoying a meal.

# How Fundraising at Restaurants Actually Works

Most restaurant fundraisers follow a straightforward structure, but the details determine success. Typically, a restaurant agrees to donate a percentage of sales generated by supporters during a defined time period. That percentage usually ranges from 15 to 30 percent, depending on the restaurant and format.

Some restaurants require supporters to present a flyer or use a digital code so eligible orders can be tracked. Others apply the donation automatically during the event window. The simpler the process, the better the results. Every extra step creates friction and lowers participation.

Restaurants that offer fundraising programs often provide basic marketing materials and post-event reporting. These systems make it easier to focus on turnout rather than logistics, especially for volunteer-led groups.

# Pizza Restaurant Fundraisers and Why They Work So Well

Pizza fundraisers remain one of the most reliable restaurant fundraising ideas. Pizza appeals to nearly every age group, works for families and teams, and fits naturally into busy schedules.

Supporters do not need to plan around a pizza fundraiser. They simply replace their usual dinner choice with one that supports a cause. That ease drives volume, especially when online ordering and delivery are available.

Pizza restaurants that offer fundraising typically allow both individual and large group orders. Team meals, family dinners, and shared orders all increase the average transaction size. When promotion emphasizes convenience and group ordering, totals rise quickly.

# Fast Casual Restaurant Fundraisers

Fast casual concepts consistently rank among the best restaurant fundraisers because they balance speed, quality, and flexibility. Supporters can dine in, grab takeout, or order ahead without committing to a long sit-down meal.

These restaurant fundraising ideas work particularly well on weekday evenings when families are pressed for time. A fast option removes excuses and encourages last-minute participation.

Fast-casual restaurants also attract a wide range of customers, helping organizations reach beyond their immediate circle. That broader appeal often leads to higher overall participation.

# Coffee Shop Fundraisers and Morning Participation

Coffee shop restaurant fundraisers tap into daily routines. Many supporters already stop for coffee on their way to work or school. A fundraiser simply redirects that habit toward a good cause.

While individual transactions are smaller, volume makes the difference. When dozens or hundreds of supporters participate throughout the day, totals add up quickly.

Coffee fundraisers perform especially well when promoted to parents, staff, and local businesses. Gift card bundles and morning reminders often increase participation even further.

# Dessert and Treat-Based Restaurant Fundraisers

Dessert-focused restaurant fundraisers feel celebratory rather than transactional. Cookies, ice cream, and specialty treats trigger emotional responses that lead to impulse participation.

These restaurant fundraising ideas work best when positioned as limited-time opportunities. When supporters feel they might miss out, participation rises.

Dessert fundraisers also pair naturally with events. They work well alongside performances, meetings, or celebrations where people are already gathered and ready to indulge.

# Partnering With Local Restaurants

[Local restaurants that offer fundraising opportunities](https://bigfundraisingideas.com/engaging-local-businesses-school-fundraisers-win-win-strategy) bring a different kind of value. While they may not have national brand recognition, they often have loyal customers and strong community ties.

These partnerships work best when there is a genuine relationship. When restaurant owners feel personally connected to the cause, they are more likely to promote the event themselves and offer flexible terms.

Local restaurant fundraisers feel authentic. Supporters appreciate knowing their money supports both a community business and the organization.

# What Separates the Best Restaurant Fundraisers From the Rest

The difference between an average restaurant fundraiser and a great one rarely comes down to the restaurant alone. Execution plays a much larger role.

Clear communication is essential. Supporters need to know when to participate, how to order, and what makes their purchase count. Even small uncertainties can reduce follow-through.

Promotion must also be intentional. The best restaurant fundraisers do not rely on a single announcement. They build awareness with reminders and reinforce the message as the event approaches.

Just as important is focus: one restaurant, one date, one action. Keeping the ask simple increases participation and reduces confusion.

# Setting Clear Expectations With Supporters and Restaurants

Expectation setting is often overlooked, yet it has a direct impact on results. When supporters understand exactly how their meal supports the cause, they are far more likely to participate. A short explanation, shared via email or social posts, builds trust and removes hesitation.

Clarity is equally important when working with the restaurant. Confirm the giveback percentage, eligible order types, and reporting timeline in advance. Restaurants that offer fundraising programs usually have established systems, but assumptions can lead to missed revenue.

Clear expectations also empower volunteers. When everyone shares the same message, promotion feels confident and consistent.

# Using Digital Tools to Increase Participation

Digital tools have become a major advantage in restaurant fundraising. Online ordering links, digital flyers, and text reminders make participation almost effortless.

Restaurant fundraising ideas perform better when supporters can act immediately. Direct links reduce drop off and eliminate the need to search for information. Text reminders sent on the day of the event often outperform email, especially for busy families.

Social sharing also extends reach. When supporters repost reminders, they introduce the fundraiser to new audiences who may not be on your mailing list but are happy to participate.

# Choosing Restaurants That Offer Fundraising Programs Wisely

Not every program is worth your time. Some restaurants offer low percentages, complicated rules, or limited order types that restrict participation.

When evaluating restaurants that offer fundraising, prioritize transparency and ease of use. Programs with clear terms, simple tracking, and flexible ordering consistently outperform those with restrictions.

Both chain and independent restaurants can succeed. The key is alignment. A restaurant your supporters already enjoy will almost always outperform a higher percentage option that feels unfamiliar.

# Common Mistakes That Limit Results

Many restaurant fundraisers underperform not because the idea is weak, but because avoidable mistakes creep in. Poor timing, unclear instructions, and a lack of reminders can all reduce turnout.

Another common issue is assuming the restaurant will promote the event. While some do, most rely on the organization to drive participation. Ownership of promotion is critical.

Running restaurant fundraisers too frequently can also cause fatigue. These events work best when spaced out and treated as special opportunities rather than constant asks.

# Building Long-Term Success With Consistency

Restaurant fundraisers are not just about one night of revenue. When used consistently but sparingly, they help build a culture of participation. Supporters learn that these events are easy, enjoyable, and meaningful.

Over time, familiarity increases turnout. People recognize the pattern and plan. Schools and teams that rotate restaurant fundraising ideas throughout the year often see stronger engagement across all campaigns.

Consistency also strengthens relationships with restaurants that offer fundraising. Positive experiences make it easier to schedule future events and collaborate more effectively.

# Combining Restaurant Fundraisers With Other Efforts

Restaurant fundraisers are most powerful when they are part of a broader fundraising rhythm. They work well as quick wins between longer campaigns or as kickoff events that build momentum.

We often see strong results when restaurant fundraisers are paired with seasonal campaigns, product fundraisers, or online donation pages. This approach keeps fundraising fresh without overwhelming supporters.

# Why Big Fundraising Ideas Support Restaurant Fundraisers

At [Big Fundraising Ideas](https://bigfundraisingideas.com/), we focus on fundraising methods that respect people's time and energy. Restaurant fundraisers align naturally with that philosophy.

They are easy to launch, familiar to supporters, and scalable for groups of all sizes. When combined with proven fundraising products and campaigns, restaurant fundraisers help organizations raise more without volunteer burnout.

Groups that use restaurant fundraising ideas strategically often see higher participation across all their fundraising efforts.

# Final Thoughts and Your Next Step

Restaurant fundraisers succeed because they meet people where they already are. A simple meal becomes a meaningful contribution, and supporters feel good about participating.

Strong results come from clarity, thoughtful promotion, and choosing restaurants that offer fundraising programs your audience already trusts. Keep the process easy, treat the event with intention, and respect your supporters' time.

1qpiiur,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1qpiiur/is_this_normal/,Is This Normal?,"This is more of a rant than anything, but I would like some advice on how to navigate my current situation. I have been working at this company for a year. I was hired as a coordinator at a location that still has not opened. They are saying it should be opening now around April, which is a year and 3 months after I got hired. I am grateful because they could’ve let me go, but instead found other work for me to do and changed my title. Some things that bother me is that they ask me to do these mandatory trainings 1.5-2 hours away from my home. I don’t feel comfortable driving/traveling this far for all day trainings that to be honest aren’t super related to my role, especially for what i’m getting paid. This entire time, I have been scheduling service, doing social media, and random tasks here and there. This service department is a disaster. We have one technician, and he only does 1-2 service installs and inspections a day. Service has always been messy here, but I feel like they want me to “save the department”. Also, due to my role being changed after being hired, there are no boundaries, and I get asked constantly to do things that aren’t my job, and to be honest, after a year I still don’t understand these systems, this company, or the technical aspects this industry. Once the location that I got hired for opens, I will basically just be an “attendant” - greeting people, making them coffee, setting up meetings, etc. I don’t want to complain because for my salary it is not bad, but I feel like at my age (28) I am regressing in my career. Maybe it is my fault as I thought being a coordinator entailed more, and maybe I should’ve just found a new job months ago. Right now, i’m looking to enroll in an MBA program focused in AI, operations, and marketing. I feel like it will give me some career leverage. How can I navigate this job until then?

TLDR: Got hired for job where location still has not opened a year later. Because of this, they changed my title, have given me random jobs here and there to fill the time, and am extremely disappointed. How do I keep a positive mindset as I transition into an MBA program? Have you heard of this before and do you think this is a normal situation? Or is this company just completely chaotic?",1,1769622731.0,work,1,1.0,False

I’d love to meet up with others at a different spot in each week and chat, maybe have coffee and a donut, get to know each other, and then spend some time giving back to nature and the community by getting rid of some trash! Is anyone interested? Or if this doesn’t spark interest, are there any other ideas for weekly clubs that others in southern Vermont would be interested in? The idea of really forming a community sounds so lovely to me right now.

*CW: Past domestic violence, self-harm ideation, explicit sexual content*

Eddie’s is the kind of restaurant that felt like it should be a neighborhood dive bar but was somehow upscale approachable. I didn’t know how these restaurateurs managed it. The interior was all dark colors, gold fixtures, and low lighting, but had the very faint smell of stale cigarette smoke. A ghost of its past, maybe. The bar dominated the front. Great whiskey collection, middling gin and rum, standard vodka. The chairs were those oversized, plushy barstools that yelled comfort but were a bitch to maneuver. I grimaced. What did Morgan see in this place? It was so opposite of the Bluejay.

House music sounded overhead as I followed the host to where Morgan was waiting for me, blessedly not in one of those stupid barstools. He stood, and I about fainted. The man looked good in his beach bum aesthetic, but holy fuck was he better dressed up. He wasn’t wearing a suit or anything, but the silver button-up with rolled-up sleeves, black slacks, and overalls? God damn. He’d made me feel overdressed at coffee and now underdressed—still in my vans, but now in a blue polo and another pair of black jeans—at dinner. Bastard.

Morgan pecked me cheek, that beard scratching me perfectly, and I whispered in his ear, “I’m going to fuck you hard tonight.” He grinned at me. We sat, and my hand was instantly on his knee. This was so easy. Felt like we’d been dating for months rather than just a quick fuck a week ago out behind the club and coffee this morning. What was I doing?

Hadley had been this easy, too, and that had ended up with me in the hospital and him in jail for assault. Was I going down the same path?

*NOT RIGHT NOW!* I yelled in my head. I was about to have dinner. And then go to a gallery. Maybe drinks afterward. Definitely sex. All doubting could kindly fuck the fuck off.

“…if you wanted wine or not?” Morgan asked.

“What? I’m sorry. I got distracted. Something about those ugly barstools.”

“You don’t like them?” Morgan looked sad, maybe a little hurt.

“No, not really. They look too heavy.”

“Oh. Um… I designed and built them.”

“Fuck. I’m sorry. I didn’t know. They… They’re cute. I’d have them at home, but a bar? Nah.”

Morgan started laughing. It was booming in a way I should have expected. The laugh lines around his eyes grew more pronounced.

“I’m messing with you,” he declared. “I told Eddie not to get them when he opened this place, but he insisted.”

I stared at him for a moment. There were knives on the table. And bread. Butter. Black tablecloth and napkins. Any of these things could be used to kill him, if I felt so inclined. I didn’t.

“Funny man,” I said. “Lesson learned: Morgan is rarely serious. Noted. You were saying something about wine?”

“Yeah. Eddie has an excellent Malbec he just got in. Bottle to share?”

I nodded. Malbecs were actually a favorite of mine and would go well with the entrée I wanted—lamb chop with a port wine demiglace, mashed potatoes, and roasted carrots and green beans. I may have scoped the menu out ahead of time. Morgan ordered the bottle as well as some appetizers for us, calamari and a caprese salad.

“How do you know Eddie?” I suspected the answer. Morgan seemed to have that way of becoming friends with anyone instantly. He was the kind of guy who smiled easily and would be one hundred percent invested in the conversation he was having. I wasn’t. Usually, I was a little more closed off, especially after Hadley. Letting yourself be vulnerable was dangerous.

Morgan’s voice cut through my internal spiraling. “Well… He’s my brother.”

Knives were looking really good right now. For me. On my arms. NO!

“So your idea of a low-stakes double date day was to invite me to the coffee shop you’re a regular at and then to your brother’s restaurant?”

“…yes…?”

“Is your brother here?”

“No. He’s down in Argentina, working with the Catenas on an exclusive wine for the restaurant.” I let out the biggest sigh of relief at that. This man did not know what the term low-stakes meant for others, just himself. What a selfish bastard. A handsome, properly bearded selfish bastard. I gripped his knee, hard, and he winced. “I take it I fucked up?”

I shook my head. No, he hadn’t fucked up. “Warn me next time, hmm? I don’t need a protective older brother going after me again. I tried to leave that back in high school.”

Morgan barked in laughter, and it was hard not to join in. Things got easier after that. Our server, blond, curly-haired (and kind of adorable in a golden retriever way) Jacky, was attentive, often at the table quietly, the kind of service you only learn from working in a business district. He looked familiar-ish, like I’d seen him somewhere before. Normally, I’d let it go, but being with Morgan made me feel bolder, and so I put the question to him.

“Maybe? I used to work downtown at the Cracked Egg. Like five years ago?”

That was it. I was a regular there. Every Wednesday, 5:00 AM, for breakfast. Met a couple of my coworkers to have coffee, eggs, and discuss the minutiae of contract law. Very boring. Very regular.

Jacky laughed at that. He remembered us, especially the big tips we always left. Said he’d been able to buy a house just from us.

“That’s actually… kind of amazing,” I told him. He blushed. Morgan was sipping wine, eyes darting back and forth between us. When Jacky went to grab our bill, he poured me another glass.

“So you can be sociable. I thought I was dating a cactus.”

I imagined myself dumping wine on him. Instead, I said, “Don’t worry. I’ll *prick* you soon.”

He smiled at that, beard quivering with the movement. Jesus, that beard did things to me. Morgan paid—“Eddie tells me I don’t have to. I can’t do that.”—and we stepped out into the cool air of early spring. I shivered in my polo, and he wrapped an arm around my shoulder.

“Need a jacket?”

“I’ve got one in the car.” We made our way there in silence. His arm was awkward around me, and I shifted it to my waist. He whined. “You’re shorter than me. It was pulling me down.”

He kicked the ground in mock frustration. I laughed. He grinned. His hand cupped my ass again. He was in trouble later. My car lights blinked as I hit the unlock button on my key fob. I grabbed the jacket from the backseat. It was an old thing. Blue. Zipper worked but the tag on it was broken. My grandmother had bought it for me before our trip to Europe after high school, a just-in-case it’s cold somewhere. I was grateful when we were high up in the Alps in Switzerland.

“Want to meander?” I asked.

“Or… The opening isn’t for another hour, and my apartment is only three blocks away…” He wiggled his eyebrows at me. I scanned around quickly. It was dark near my car, no streetlights, no windows. Hadn’t meant to park in a place like this, but perfect. I pushed him against my car, got on my knees, and undid his pants.

“Oh. Fuck,” he moaned.

\*\*\*

“SUN-DRENCHED,” said the sign at the front of the gallery. The lights were bright. The cheap wine in my hand was far too acidic to be considered good. People milled about. There was a flautist in the corner. Interesting choice. Different. Fit what I knew about Sammy from the brief encounter that morning. Her art? AMAZING. I’d already purchased four pieces for my apartment, and rounded the check up to the next hundred. Morgan was rubbing off on me, or maybe it was the swallowing that did the trick.

He was off chatting with people he apparently knew (or maybe didn’t, I couldn’t tell—he was just that way). Sammy was flitting about, dressed in a neon purple pantsuit, thanking people for being there. She nearly cried when I finished writing the check for $6,000.

“Babe, this stuff is good,” I explained. “I love the way you capture the sun on the petals. I’m glad Morgan invited me.”

She over-thanked me and begged me to wait until her wife showed up. I agreed and wandered back to Morgan. My hand found his pocket, slipped in, and squeezed. He yipped.

“Hey, babe,” he said without looking at me.

“Love,” I responded. “Introduce me?”

The couple Morgan had been talking to were a bank manager and his wife, older folks, friends of Sammy’s parents. Showed up to be supportive. Were blown away by the art and had also made purchases. We mock-argued when I told them I’d bought a piece they were eyeing—Dapples on the Pond. Morgan stood there, looking a little lost, as I invited them over for dinner so they could see the small gallery I was curating.

When they made excuses to leave, Morgan spoke again. “I honestly didn’t think you did the whole small-talk thing.”

“I know I can come off prickly, but I’m a lawyer. Talking is what I do, and they were nice, plus maybe a new client. Richard said something a side project he might need a contract for.”

That earned me a kiss. Morgan note number two: he liked it when I broke out of my shell. Or he liked my being lawyerly. Only time would tell.

“Aaron?” I turned around at the sound of my name and found my frequent collaborator gliding toward me. She was in a silver pantsuit, blonde hair done in a Marilyn Monroe-style updo. Totally out of date, totally her.

“Miranda! What are you doing here?”

“Supporting my girlfriend. What about you?”

“On a date. Wait. Sammy is your girlfriend? The ‘Samantha’ we hear about all the time? The one who has to keep you on time?”

“She is. How do you know her?”

“Met her this morning. Morgan—the guy from the club? Yeah, him—asked me to join him tonight. He’s a regular at the Bluejay, and I think they’re friends?”

Miranda extended her hand to Morgan, who shook it numbly.

“What the fuck?” he said intelligently.

I giggled. Miranda giggled. Sammy had silent joined us, and she started giggling. Finally, Morgan let go and giggled.

“It’s a small, small world, after all,” he said after a time.

“Miranda, you know Aaron?” Sammy questioned. That yellow smudge of paint was still under her eye.

“Yeah. Brilliant at contracts. Loves the details. Can be a hedgehog if you piss him off.” I glared at Miranda. She smiled. She was right, though. Mess with my contracts? Game over. “Another firm tried to use a loophole that he’d written to negate a contract. He was so angry. Went through everything about their firm. Discovered they weren’t properly incorporated, got them dissolved, and thrown off the case all in ten minutes. He’s wicked when he wants to be.”

“Not gonna lie… That’s kinda hot,” Morgan stated. “Aaron, wanna do my contracts?”

He was wiggling his eyebrows again. Miranda and Sammy guffawed. I asked them if they wanted to get together sometime next weekend for brunch. They agreed on the condition that Morgan was invited. I shot them an annoyed look that brought more giggles.

We left not too long after that, heading back towards my car. We walked side by side, hands clasped together. Car lights blinked as we leaned against the sedan.

“You are a surprising person, Aaron Gutierrez.”

“Call me Enigma.”

“No. I wanna call you boyfriend instead.”

“You better be ready for all that entails.”

He studied me then looked away, just a moment. “I kinda like how you’re nervous but confident, always in the moment but noting everything.”

His thumb was rubbing up and down my thumb.

“At some point, we need to talk about my past,” I offered.

“Don’t care.” I know he didn’t mean it to sound callous, but he also didn’t know what I hadn’t told him.

“Morgan. Don’t. This is new. Us. Not tonight, but maybe tomorrow or next week, I need you to know what’s happened in my past. Okay?” I rubbed his thumb back.

“I don’t do serious.”

“I can tell, but if you want to call me boyfriend, serious is going to happen.”

“Okay.”

I kissed his cheek then pulled his hand to my mouth. I kissed the back of it. “Now. You said your apartment is three blocks away?”

“Yes.”

“Good. I have plans, and they involve us naked, and you begging. Agreed?”

The smile that lit up his face made my heart skip a beat. He nearly dragged me down the street like a dog straining against its leash. When we woke the next morning, he couldn’t walk, which had been the plan all along.",1,1769622066.0,u_EliSimpsonWrites,0,1.0,False

Rain turned the trail into mud beneath the full moon.

Every step dragged. Every breath burned.

Steel rang in the trees.

Two figures clashed in the shadows—one wrapped in worn, glowing armor, the other moving like the dark itself. Blades struck, sparks flashing before vanishing into the rain.

“You won’t take it,” the hunter said, his hand pressed tight against the Amulet at his chest.

She didn’t answer. She only circled him—patient, precise.

They rushed each other again.

The hunter swung first. Too slow.

She slipped past the blade, fingers grazing the chain at his neck. He jumped back just in time, heart hammering.

She isn’t trying to kill me, he realized.

She’s waiting.

Waiting for him to fall. Waiting for weakness.

They charged once more.

At the last second, the hunter let his sword drop into the mud.

Her eyes widened.

“No—”

He stepped forward.

Her blade pierced his chest.

Pain flared white-hot—but he didn’t scream.

“As long as I’m dead,” he said, voice steady despite the blood,

“you’ll never take it.”

She tore the blade free and stumbled back.

The Amulet went cold.

Stone crept across his skin, racing faster than the rain could fall. His fingers locked in place. His armor dulled. Cracks whispered through his body as flesh became stone.

With the last of his strength, he pulled his arm over his chest—shielding the Amulet.

She struck the statue in rage. Stone shattered from the arm and fell into the mud.

It didn’t matter.

The Amulet was stone.

Her breath shook. “Then I’ll wait,” she said quietly.

“For the next one.”

She vanished into the trees.

The statue stood alone beneath the rain—

another hunter claimed by the cycle.

Stone cracked.

A sharp, piercing sound cut through the darkness.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

Ethan didn’t move.

Jack stood in the doorway, arms crossed, listening to the alarm scream for the third time. “You’re actually unbelievable.”

He walked in, grabbed Ethan’s pillow, and slammed it into his face.

Ethan shot upright. “What—Jack?!”

“You’re late,” Jack said. “Again.”

Ethan groaned and rolled out of bed. “Why didn’t you wake me earlier?”

“You told me not to,” Jack said. “Something about ‘training your mind.’”

“Never listen to me when I say that.”

They rushed downstairs. Ethan grabbed an apple from the counter, barely tying his shoes before they were out the door.

They hopped on their bikes and took off down the street.

“Trail or road?” Jack asked.

“Trail,” Ethan said. “It’s faster.”

“It rained last night.”

“You won’t get muddy if you don’t fall.”

Jack didn’t answer. He already knew how this would end.

The trail was narrow and slick. Ethan took the lead, apple in one hand, handlebars in the other.

He glanced back. “You keeping up?”

When he looked forward again, the statue was right there.

Ethan slammed the brakes.

The tires slid. The bike tipped.

He hit the ground hard, skidding through mud.

Jack stopped just in time, shaking his head. “Called it.”

Ethan pushed himself up. “Who puts a statue in the middle of a trail?”

Up close, it looked ancient. Cracked stone. Missing an arm. The surface was worn, like it had been forgotten for a long time.

“That thing looks ready to fall apart,” Jack said.

Ethan spotted something half-buried nearby. “I think this is the arm.”

“Ethan, we don’t have time—”

Ethan ignored him.

He pressed the arm into place.

It clicked.

For a split second, the statue’s right hand—resting over its chest—glowed faintly.

Neither of them noticed.

The light vanished.

The statue cracked.

Then shattered.

Stone collapsed inward, hitting the ground in a cloud of dust.

Ethan froze. “I just destroyed someone’s statue.”

Jack stared at the rubble. “It was already breaking. You just… helped.”

Sunlight flashed off something metallic beneath the stone.

Ethan knelt and dug it out.

It was heavy. Smooth. Circular.

“What is that?” Jack asked.

Ethan turned it in his hand. “Looks like a coin.”

Jack’s phone rang.

“Yeah—yeah, we’re late,” Jack said, hanging up. “My aunt’s already mad. Move.”

Ethan slipped the object into his pocket and grabbed his bike.

At school, Ethan changed out of his mud-covered clothes and sat on the locker room bench.

He pulled the coin out.

It pulsed.

Slow. Steady.

Like a heartbeat.

Ethan frowned and shoved it back into his bag.

In class, Mr. Wells stood at the front of the room.

“Summer break is two months away,” he said. “Before then, you’ll be completing a partner project. Worth thirty-five percent of your grade.”

Jack grinned. “Guess who your partner is.”

Ethan narrowed his eyes. “What did you do?”

Jack raised his hand. “Sir, could Ethan and Emma work together?”

Mr. Wells nodded. “That’s fine.”

Ethan leaned over. “Why would you do that?”

“Because you like her,” Jack said. “And because you’d never talk to her otherwise.”

“I had a plan.”

Jack snorted. “No, you didn’t.”

Later that evening, Ethan got home alone.

He tossed his bag on the couch and pulled the coin out again.

It pulsed once.

Then stopped.

“This thing is weird,” he muttered.

A knock came from the back door.

Ethan froze.

Another knock.

He stood, walked over, and opened the door slowly.

Nothing.

Just trees.

He heard breathing.

Then nothing again.

He shut the door and turned—

Something was inside the house.

Ethan stumbled backward and fell, scrambling across the floor.

The thing was tall. Wrong. Not human.

It spoke in a language Ethan didn’t understand.

His breathing went wild.

He grabbed the coin and pointed it at the creature without thinking.

The thing stopped.

Its voice changed.

“The relic,” it said.

Ethan’s vision blurred.

The room tilted.

Darkness swallowed him.

“This is a problem,” the creature said calmly. “I’ll try again tomorrow.”

Somewhere deep in a forest, a masked man stood over a pile of stone rubble.

“It’s gone,” he said.

A three-legged creature growled beside him. “What do we do now?”

“She failed,” the masked man said. “Kill her.”

“Is that what the boss wants?”

“She’s useless,” he replied. “Go.”

Chapter 2 

Ethan woke up staring at the ceiling.

For a moment, he didn’t move. His back hurt. The carpet was rough against his cheek.

“Ethan,” his mom said from the doorway. “Why are you on the floor?”

He pushed himself up slowly, heart already starting to race. The memory hit him all at once—the breathing, the shape in the dark, the word relic.

“I—I don’t know,” he said. “Must’ve rolled off the couch.”

She frowned but didn’t press it. “You scared me. I thought you passed out.”

“I’m fine,” Ethan said quickly. Too quickly.

She checked her phone. “I have to get to work. There’s food in the fridge. Don’t stay up all night again.”

“It’s the weekend,” Ethan blurted.

She paused. “Yeah. I know.” Then she forced a smile. “I’ll be back later.”

The door closed.

The house went quiet.

Ethan stood there for a second, listening. No breathing. No footsteps.

But the image of the thing from last night wouldn’t leave his head.

His eyes went to the coffee table.

The coin was gone.

His chest tightened. He searched the couch cushions, the floor, under the table. Finally, he found it half-hidden near the TV stand.

The moment he picked it up, it pulsed—slow, steady, like a heartbeat.

“This is what you were talking about,” he muttered. “This is the relic.”

His phone buzzed.

Jack.

“Yo,” Jack said. “You alive?”

“Yeah,” Ethan said. “Listen… can you come over? I need to tell you something.”

There was a pause. “You sound weird.”

“Just come over.”

Ten minutes later, Jack was in Ethan’s living room, arms crossed as Ethan paced.

“So,” Jack said, “you’re telling me you saw some… thing in your house?”

“I didn’t imagine it,” Ethan snapped. “It spoke. It said this—” He held up the coin. “—was a relic.”

Jack stared at it. “That’s a coin.”

“It glows,” Ethan said.

Right on cue, the coin pulsed faintly.

Jack’s smile faded. “Okay. That’s… new.”

A loud thump came from upstairs.

Both of them froze.

Another sound. Footsteps.

Jack grabbed the broom from beside the door. “If this is a prank—”

“I don’t mess around like this,” Ethan said, grabbing the TV remote because it was the closest thing to him.

The attic ladder creaked.

Jack swallowed. ""What was that?”

They climbed slowly, every step loud in the silence.

Boxes were overturned. Something moved.

A shape stumbled forward and hit the floor with a heavy thud.

Ethan and Jack both shouted and started throwing whatever they could grab.

“Stop!” the thing said.

Its voice was rough, but clear.

“I am not here to hurt you.”

Jack froze. “That’s not what things that don’t hurt people usually say.”

The creature slowly raised its hands. It was tall, its form wrong in ways Ethan couldn’t explain.

“I need answers,” Ethan said, his voice shaking. “Start talking.”

The creature hesitated. “I am Asura.”

Silence.

“My name is Kaelon.”

Jack glanced at Ethan. “That’s… not helping.”

Kaelon’s eyes moved between them. “Who among you carries the relic?”

Ethan looked down at the coin in his hand.

“This?” he said.

Kaelon’s gaze locked onto it.

“Yes,” he said quietly.

Then his expression shifted—confusion, disbelief.

“…How does a human have it?”

Do I just soak the steam wand tip using the recommended water/solution ratio?

# Key Takeaways

* You can watch the Kairat Almaty vs Arsenal live stream through official broadcasters like Paramount+, BT Sport, FuboTV, or local channels such as Qazsport.
* A VPN is essential if you want to access the Arsenal vs Kairat Almaty live stream while traveling or from geo-blocked regions.
* Always check team news before kickoff—Arsenal misses Partey and Timber, while Kairat Almaty is without key defender Sokolenko.
* Arsenal is favored due to their strong home Champions League form, but Kairat Almaty is known for disrupting with high energy and set pieces.
* For the best viewing experience, use smart TV apps or an HDMI connection to catch every moment of the live stream on the big screen.
* Lineups and last-minute changes can impact the match, so stay updated right up to game time.

# How to watch the Champions League match

If the words ""geo-blocked"" make you want to launch your remote across the room, trust me, you're not alone. Watching Champions League matches has become a sport itself, with local rights, subscriptions, and, yep, those inevitable blackout zones.

Here's how you can watch Arsenal vs Kairat Almaty wherever you are:

* **Official Broadcasters:** In the US, Paramount+ streams the Champions League, while UK folks can tune in to BT Sport. Head's up: coverage varies, so double-check the listings for your territory.
* **Streaming Platforms:** FuboTV is a personal favorite, it gives you a free trial and is usually reliable for big match days. Hulu + Live TV sometimes sneaks in UEFA coverage, though it's worth confirming before kickoff.
* **Local networks:** Kazakhstan's Qazsport typically covers major ties involving Kairat Almaty: Arsenal fans in London can catch games at pubs close to Emirates, though you might want to book ahead.

# How to watch anywhere with a VPN

You know the drill, sometimes, you just can't access your favorite streams because of where you are. That's when a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a life-saver. Here's the quick play-by-play:

1. **Choose a VPN:** NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark are tried-and-true options. I've personally used NordVPN while traveling through Central Asia, and it hasn't failed me yet.
2. **Connect to the location:** If you want UK coverage, set your VPN server to the UK. Craving US commentary? Go for a New York server.
3. **Open your streaming site:** Visit the official broadcaster's website or app. Your stream should now be unlocked. (And no, you don't need to pretend you love beans on toast to convince the server you're British. Just the VPN is enough.)

Pro tip: Test your connection before kickoff. There's nothing worse than missing an early goal because you're still fiddling with VPN settings.

# Arsenal vs Kairat Almaty kick-off time

Timing is everything, especially if you're planning snacks, group chats, or, like me, strategic cat-naps before the big event.

* **UK:** 8:00 PM BST
* **US:** 3:00 PM ET / 12:00 PM PT
* **Kazakhstan:** 1:00 AM the next day (maybe make some strong coffee...)

# Match preview

Arsenal comes in as favorites, flexing their mid-season form. The Gunners' recent fixtures have showcased razor-sharp attack, especially with Saka and Gabriel Martinelli in sync. But Kairat Almaty isn't just here for the scenery. Known for their high-energy style, they're not afraid to disrupt the rhythm, pressing high and banking on set-piece opportunities. Expect a clash of styles: technical versus tenacious.

# Injury news, suspensions, key stats

* **Arsenal:** Thomas Partey is nursing a hamstring (again), while Jurrien Timber's knee issues continue to sideline him. But watch out for Emile Smith Rowe, he's back in training.
* **Kairat Almaty:** Defender Aleksandr Sokolenko is suspended, and midfielder Yerkin Tapalov has a lingering ankle issue.
* **Key stat:** Arsenal have averaged 2.1 goals per match at home in UEFA games since last season. Kairat Almaty, on the flip side, have managed to score in 4 out of their last 5 away games in Europe. So, sitting on a clean sheet? Unlikely.

# Team news & squads

Now for the juicy bits. Team news ahead of a Champions League night is always a blend of hope, anxiety, and wild speculation, especially if you (like me) obsessively refresh Twitter for 'leaked' lineups.

For Arsenal, Mikel Arteta is likely to rotate very slightly, keeping in mind Premier League congestion. Expect the big guns: Odegaard will probably marshal midfield, and Zinchenko might slot in as left-back if his fitness passes muster.

Kairat Almaty have fewer rotational headaches but will desperately miss Aleksandr Sokolenko in defense, he's their anchor at the back. Look for them to stack midfield numbers and try to break in behind Arsenal's high line.

Benches to watch: Arsenal's attack is deep, Trossard and Nketiah could feature off the bench. Meanwhile, Kairat might bring on speedy winger Arman Kenesov if they're chasing the game late.

# Formation

Managers love to talk about 'flexibility,' but let's be honest, everyone will be watching how both teams actually set up on the pitch.

If Arsenal plays their typical 4-3-3, expect Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes to anchor defense with Saliba's pace to mop up on the right. Midfield is all about quick rotation, with Rice dropping deep and Zinchenko sliding inward when needed.

Kairat Almaty? They're more traditional, likely to bank on a 4-2-3-1, staying compact and hoping for quick counters. Don't be surprised if they pack five in midfield when out of possession, Arsenal's passing triangles have shaken up tougher teams than Kairat this season.

# Probable lineup

Let's talk names, not just Xs and Os. Here's who you'll probably see on the pitch:

**Arsenal (Projected):**

* Ramsdale (GK)
* White, Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko
* Rice, Odegaard, Vieira
* Saka, Jesus, Martinelli

**Kairat Almaty (Projected):**

* Pokatilov (GK)
* Seidu, Maliy, Blagojevic, Alip
* Tattybaev, Tagybergen, Tapalov
* Turysbek, Esskhata, Kuat

Changes could happen right before kick-off, so don't @ me if Arteta pulls a tactical twist.

# Probable lineup

I know, I know, another probable lineup section? Consider this your backstage pass for the latest rumor mill right before kickoff. Coaches love to play mind games, so always take leaks with a pinch of salt and maybe a dash of wishful thinking.

# Injuries and Suspended players

For Arsenal, Thomas Partey and Jurrien Timber are definitely out (their Instagram stories are all gym selfies and physio tables right now). Kairat Almaty's defensive lynchpin, Aleksandr Sokolenko, is suspended, and Yerkin Tapalov seems touch-and-go, leaning toward late fitness tests.

# Form

Arsenal's unbeaten run at home stretches back to the mid-autumn, with just a solitary draw against Liverpool to blemish the record. Kairat Almaty, meanwhile, has a mixed run: two wins, two draws, and a loss in their last five. Not shabby, but not exactly title-chasing form either.

# ARS - Form

Let's zoom in: Arsenal's form has been, pardon the pun, Gunning for greatness. Five straight home wins in European competitions, 13 goals scored, just three conceded. Their XG (Expected Goals) is through the roof, with Saka and Martinelli often making defenders look like training cones. Confidence is high, but a misstep here could open old Champions League wounds.

Personal confession: I once tried to predict Arsenal's best run-in, only to have my bracket shattered by a late Greek comeback. Moral of the story? Even hot streaks can end abruptly, so banish complacency, folks. Every Champions League night brings its own flavor of chaos.

# KAL - Form

Consistency is the word Arsenal fans would use to describe Kairat Almaty, but not always in a good way. Their last five matches read like a roll-call of scrappy draws and narrow wins, but they rarely look out of depth, especially when they play away from home. They thrive in chaos, often poaching goals against the run of play.

# Head-to-Head Record

This is the first time these clubs lock horns, so no rich tapestry of previous battles. What that means: both sides have the element of the unknown. Arsenal, used to being the studied team, will have to watch for surprise tactics and hidden playmakers that Kairat Almaty likes to unleash when you least expect it.

# Standings

Before kickoff, Arsenal sits comfortably near the top of their group, thanks to high-octane wins in earlier rounds. Kairat Almaty's journey has been more nail-biting, they squeaked through the qualifiers and know the value of every away point.

# Step-by-step VPN guide to watch Arsenal vs Kairat Almaty today

1. **Pick your VPN provider**, ExpressVPN, NordVPN, or Surfshark are all solid
2. **Connect to a server** in the region where the game is legally broadcast
3. **Clear your browser cache and cookies** for good measure (sometimes the internet just needs a restart, like the rest of us)
4. **Head to your broadcaster's website/app** and get streaming. If it asks for location, your VPN's got your back

I've dusted off the code and returned to the **Terminal Generator** – that tool that lets you build in-game computer terminals for your TTRPG sessions (Mothership, Cyberpunk, Alien, sci-fi, you name it!).

First off, a massive thank you! While I was away, you all went absolutely wild. **There are now over 300 terminals** in the shared database. That's incredible! I'm genuinely blown away and so happy this tool has been useful for your games. Well.. some are tests, but nice anyway!

**Updates**:  
I had to overhaul the old ""lock/unlock"" system for saving terminals. Here’s the new deal:

* **To save a terminal now,** you'll need to register with an email & password. This is purely for security and ownership.
* **Don't worry!** Every terminal you've already created and **locked** is safe, unchanged, and will work forever as it always has.
* For **unlocked/open terminals** you made previously: you can ""reclaim"" them by logging in and loading them from the generator backoffice. Once you do, they're tied to your account and only you can edit them.

**Privacy Promise, Full Stop:** The email is only for login and confirmation emails. I will **never** use it for anything else. No spam, no newsletters, no funny business. Use a spare mail if you don't trust me, no problem. 

* **Performance Boost:** I optimized things for those of you who craft massive, menu-heavy terminals. The editor should feel much snappier now.

**Links for the curoius.**

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Stick it in in a tight wet container and you are supposed to get a white creamy substance…

Ahem.

Today I used my French press. Because what else are you going to do with the several overfilled pucks worth of freshly ground coffee you had to start over on the day before? And I wanted to do what 95% of others do with coffee grown in the most select regions at specific altitudes, roasted to perfection, ground with the finest engineered precision equipment and lovingly brewed with the finest equipment using scales and tools and ratios to extract the peak of flavor…

Obviously, drown it in milk.

So…on goes the machine. Steam…protuberance…heated and excess pre-cu…water removed. Into the pitcher goes the full fat organically grown milk pulled from only the finest hand picked cows raised on tender grasses in a picturesque meadow…or a dairy factory farm, the plastic bottle said “organic”. And into the milk goes the hot throbbing protuberance… which somehow seems backwards.

I mean, you’re just whipping milk into a froth with steam. I’ve watched videos from people named Lance…how hard can it be?

Well, turns out very. First of all, my protuberance is short and the lighting in my coffee “station” sucks. The first problem…I’ve been reassured it can get the job done because it’s how you use it. The second…clearly I need to go back on YouTube  and look up “Italian Espresso lighting fixtures”. I’m pretty sure it exists and has special coffee filtered light to make your chrome look even…chromier and not penetrate the coffee bags exposing the beans to light…which they grew in for months.

So, it’s steaming by Braile. Got it. You are supposed to hold it at the angle…just so…and stick just the tip in while it makes noises…then plunge it in deeper while feeling it until it gets hot. Sure. I think it’s swirling and it is growing and the pitcher got pretty darned  warm…but not too hot. Turned it off and I got hot milk. I don’t think I’m making art with that. Okay. More video watching.

Dump it into the slowly extracted coffee. My French press was wondering what the hell it should do with this fine powdery substance. But eventually I have a cup of black liquid and after tasting I added the milk. All of it. It’s…coffee,  questionable coffee with milk. What am I gonna do?

Well, obviously, add Ghirardelli chocolate powder because if you have questionable coffee and un frothy hot milk, the solution is to clearly make a mocha. Which was good.

This isn’t a seminar. It’s not a panel. And you don’t need to “know your stuff” to come.

This is a conversation for women+ who want to:

Feel more confident talking about money

Grab a mimosa or coffee if you’d like (not included), pull up a chair, and join a space where questions are encouraged, judgment is not, and connection comes first.

✨ Come solo or bring you bestie(s)

✨ You’ll leave feeling empowered, supported, and less alone

Come for the conversation. Leave with clarity, confidence, and community.

See you there!

I am able to make quite tasty shots with the low flow rate basket, but with the high flow rate basket, my shots are quite bitter with a medium-light roast bean. I'm hitting good resistance when I pull down the lever but as soon as I get in the espresso range (7-9) bars, the resistance decreases substantially and the flow rate increases with clear signs of channelling (from inspecting the shot live using the mirror and bottomless portafilter). 

What am I doing wrong? I've included a picture of my puck after I flush out the remaining water and air bubbles. It's sticky and crumbles.

  
My workflow:

1. Pre heat at high setting, 95°C water in kettle. Portafilter locked in during preheating.
2. Grind coffee beans, I've tried 18g (very fine), 18.5g (fine), 19g (coarser). If I go for 19g but same grind setting as 18g or 18.5g it chokes the machine. Still channels but takes far too long (>50s).
3. WDT tool (going in deep and not just the surface)
4. Tamp
5. Add puck screen
6. Whilst the lever is down, I fill in water, lever up, wait a few seconds and then pull.
7. Ive tried pre-infusion between 6-20 seconds. Only a few drops come out. 
8. Ramp up to 8-9 bar and the flow rate increases with little resistance.

This sub has been so helpful with planning I thought I would add a review as well. If you have any other questions I’d love to answer them as well! Sorry this will be long.

Booking: I booked in July for a trip in the end of January. I booked through chase travel for points. I reached out for my own reservations for dinners and activities at this email: [guestservice\_cdlp@hotelxcaret.com](mailto:guestservice_cdlp@hotelxcaret.com)

They were extremely responsive. I heard back within a day. I reached out 7 weeks before my trip. I know there’s so much stress online about reservations at 30 days out but at La Casa they are much more flexible. I had everything I wanted booked at the times I wanted with no issue. I was stressed but I didn’t need to be. A really great start.

Arriving- we got there from CUN. This was the first time flying into Mexico so I heard the horror stories of the long waits for luggage and the “fish bowl”. Our flight arrived at 12:45. Customs was a breeze (From the US, also sorry) we used the e-passport scanners and I would recommend them unless you wanted the passport stamp. Luggage came out in about 40 mins. We were not stoped or questioned by any agents on the way out. No one stopped us in the fish bowl. Yes we paid the Visitax, no, no one asked us for proof. All and all very lucky. We were out of the airport in less than hour which I know is not always the case. We were in terminal 3 so we walked right outside and to the right is the Xcarte lounge with the people in the pink shirts. The ask for your passport and what hotel you are staying at. An employee then walks you right over to a private car (this was a Yukon) no one was sharing the ride with us, just myself and my husband.It was very nice. The ride was 1 hour, there was no traffic for us. We arrive to the breathtaking lobby.

Check-in: no issues here, this took about 10 minutes. They bring a welcome drink and we singed some papers. Make sure you have the WhatsApp as this will be your life line during your stay. There was a hold of $1000 USD on your card until after stay. We arrived around 2:45 and our room wasn’t ready yet so we were taken down to Tuch de Luna for lunch. Room was ready right after!

Room: We booked the lowest level room, just wellness suite garden view. To our surprise we were given a wellness ocean view room instead! It was beautiful. More beautiful in person than the pictures can justify. Everything was in great condition. The A/C worked perfect. The shower pressure was amazing. The only complaint is that the door for the toilet was thin and there wasn’t much privacy there but not a big deal. The tub was great. We had someone in the room next door to us and we couldn’t hear a thing. I will say that a staff member told us the occupancy was only about 40%-50% during our stay, so I wouldn’t expect an upgrade during a busier time.

Service: My god the service was top notch. At one point my husband asked where the ice machine was for a bottle of wine at the front and the staff apologized to us and said please we will take care of that for you. Just use WhatsApp next time. And an ice bucket showed up at our door 5 minutes later. Then without asking the next days they put anything in the room we had in ice. We were almost a little uncomfortable how useless we felt because they literally did now want you to do anything. I didn’t even put a napkin on my lap once. Anytime we sat down at the pool they offered us a drink, and if you were there for long enough about every hour they would come by with a little treat. Melon balls? Yes please. Cucumber popsicle? Umm yes! It gave me the feeling you have when you are a kid and your mom takes you to the pool. All you have to do is show up and mom’s got the towels and the snacks! So amazing. Every day our butler would text us, how can I help you? They always had reminders for your rides to dinners and activities as well. Anytime you wanted to leave the hotel a car would be ready in minutes. Service was 10/10.

Food: Wow. I’ll tell you, the food I had at every place at La Casa de la Playa was top notch. Not one single item I had was bad, or even just okay.

Tuch de Luna- we ate lunch here twice and breakfast twice. The service was so fast. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a dish but we never felt rushed to finish it. The yogurt is as good as everyone says. Please get it. Every piece of fruit used in every dish was perfect. The coffee was good. The bread buffet was amazing. The little side buffet with cold cuts and desserts looked nice but we never used it, there was always so much food. The juices were good too. The welcome green lemonade? Perfection 10/10.

Xal- We didn’t book a dinner here as the reviews online were mixed. We were so impressed with Tuch de Luna that we actually didn’t even try the breakfast here until the last day which we regretted. The breakfast was so good. The yogurt wasn’t as good as Tuch, but very creative with baked apples. My husband had the French toast and I had the ham and cheese toast and it was outstanding. We decided to go for lunch that day as well and it did not disappoint. I had the cold soup (like a gazpacho), tomatoes, and tuna tartare and it was fantastic. My husband had the guacamole with octopus and chicken yakitori and was also very impressed. We would have eaten here more if we had the time.

Lumbre- We had dinner here once. The cocktails were very good! The dinner was cooked perfectly. My husband had a filet but they brought over tortillas and suggested you make a taco. The fanciest taco we’ve ever had. The deserts were so creative. I had a strawberries and cream where dehydrated strawberry dust was toasted and the sprinkled on meringue sheets. Yum.

Ha- excellent food and worth the trip over to Mexico. Free for La Casa guests. The wine pairing with each dish was fun and I definitely got tipsy here. There were 9 dishes with an additional welcome cocktail and dish and an extra thank you dessert from the chef. You will leave full and happy. Staff were a delight.

Omakase at Tah-Xido- This was at Arte, it’s a paid experience but is free for La Casa guests. Sake was an additional cost so we just stuck to the welcome drink and sparkling water for this one. The waitress said “its 13 courses, but don’t worry the dishes are small” as she brings over a large bowl with 8 pieces of sashimi each. Omg this is a must do. The fish was so fresh and the dishes were so creative. If you want to try omakase for the first time this is a good way to do it. I don’t like uni (sea urchin) but when prepared with rice, figs, and raspberries it’s actually very good. I did skip the crunchy scorpion at the end, but my husband said it wasn’t that bad. (It was paired with wagyu)

Sunday brunch at Lad Cuevas-Honestly we didn’t love this one. Don’t get me wrong the food choices and options were phenomenal, but we felt that it was very over crowded. Getting the staffs attention at stands for food was more challenging, and some of the other guests were a little pushy. It doesn’t really fit the relaxing vibe if that’s what your looking for. You may want to skip it. I would have been disappointed if we paid 200 USD a person for this.

Experiences:

VIP backstage show for Xcarte:

This was a very cool experience. Our tour guide was excellent and you could tell he had so much love for the culture and what the show represented. We actually ran into him working at the park a few days later near the butterfly pavilion and he was genuinely excited to see us. I regret that I can’t remember his name. It was nice to have the background for the show as it made it even more exciting. The show was very fun and we had a blast! I will say the food was just so/so but we expected this going in. The server was very nice! I didn’t like going up on stage on the riser before the show with the crowd but that’s just me. If you could ask to do the tour/show without the dinner, I think that would make for a better time as at some points it was harder to focus on the show with the rotation of food being dropped off.

Xenotes tour: This was a blast. I didn’t know going in that La Casa guests get their own tour guide and van and it was just myself my husband, the guide and the photographer. It was crazy cool to have each cenote to ourselves. I was worried it would be a little much not having a group with us but I was wrong. We could stay at each spot as long as we wanted, re do the zip lines as many times as we wanted. We cut the lines with groups who were there before us (which I did feel a little bad about). We got longer routes in the kayak portion. We could jump off the cliffs as many times as we wanted! It was a dream. The lunch was a whole sandwich buffet set up for just us two! It was actually surprisingly good. They also had wines and beer but I have enough anxiety as it is without the alcohol and cliff jumping. We were done early and dropped off at about 3:30 as we got through the stuff faster. Which was nice to have a little extra time before dinner.

Last thoughts: I’m a Nurse, my husband’s an engineer. The place is expensive. The prices I see posted now are high. If I didn’t do credit card points and book early this place would have been out of reach. I don’t think we will be able to go again,but am I glad we did it. Every time we walked over to Arte or Mexico I was glad we booked La Casa de la playa as it’s so much more relaxing. The food was some of the best food I’ve ever had. The service is probably the best we will ever have. The staff were genuinely happy to help you. I don’t have a single negative thought about this trip (except baggage claim at JFK, if you know, you know.) We tipped everyone. Drivers, housekeeping, bell boys, room service, our butlers. Not just because of millennial guilt and the obligation we have back in the US (again, sorry) but because we felt the staff deserved it. Some people were tipping, some people weren’t.  The service didn’t change.  If you can, book the trip. :)",7,1769621149.0,Xcaret,1,1.0,False

That’s not a tweak — that’s the difference between saying “act professional” and building a full expert system.

Example personas Google shared:

* **Ruthless Product Manager:** Upload user feedback and specs. It finds contradictions, highlights weak points, and creates decision memos.
* **Middle School Teacher:** Upload complex topics. It breaks them down with relatable examples, pop culture references, and quizzes.
* **Scientific Researcher:** Upload academic papers. It extracts key findings, points out weaknesses, and cites sources — PhD-level analysis, no PhD required.

You can even build your own — like an **SEO strategist**, **legal analyst**, or **content marketer** persona.

Each one behaves differently based on the tone and format you define.

To set it up, go to [notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com), upload your documents, click the gear icon, and drop your detailed persona into the “Custom Prompt” field.

That field used to hold 500 characters. Now it holds 10,000.

That’s the real power of this upgrade.



# Gemini 3 Integration: A Smarter Brain for Better Research

NotebookLM now runs on **Gemini 3**, Google’s most advanced reasoning model.

Same interface — different brain.

It’s better at connecting ideas, handling complex data, and drawing insights from long documents.

Ask deeper questions like:  
“How do these three studies contradict each other?” or “What patterns exist across these sources?”

It’ll not only find the answer — it’ll show you how it got there.

This update dropped quietly in December 2025, and most people still don’t realize their NotebookLM got a serious IQ boost.



# Data Tables: Turn Chaos into Structure

Ever had 50 pages of notes you wished were in a spreadsheet?

Now you can.

The **NotebookLM Free AI Research Tool** can automatically extract structured data from your documents and export it to Google Sheets.

Turn meeting notes into actionable tasks.  
Turn research PDFs into comparison tables.  
Turn textbooks into topic summaries.

You tell it what columns you want — NotebookLM builds the table and exports it instantly.

No manual copy-paste. No missed data.



# Deep Research: The Feature That Changes Everything

This is the feature that made me delete three other research tools.

Give NotebookLM a question — it builds a full **research plan**, searches hundreds of websites, and compiles a report with **citations** in minutes.

You can choose between **Fast Research** for quick insights or **Deep Research** for comprehensive studies.

It’s like having a team of analysts doing all your prep work — while you grab coffee.

This feature alone makes NotebookLM one of the best **free AI tools** Google has ever released.



# Mind Maps and Audio Overviews: Understand Anything Faster

NotebookLM now generates **interactive mind maps** to visualize how ideas connect across documents.

Perfect for complex topics — you can expand, collapse, or click through relationships between concepts.

Then there’s **Audio Overviews** — the viral feature that turns your documents into podcasts.

Two AI hosts talk through your content, explaining it in plain English.

Now you can even choose the format:

* **Brief:** Quick summaries
* **Critique:** Analytical debate
* **Deep Dive:** Full exploration

You can also adjust tone, pacing, and duration — perfect for learning while working out or commuting.

And yes — it’s still free.



# Multi-File Support: Everything in One Place

NotebookLM now supports Google Sheets, Docs, PDFs, Word files, images, audio files, and URLs.

Upload everything, and it treats it as one connected knowledge base.

That means you can combine research papers, meeting notes, and website data into one workspace — and let the AI do the rest.

Writers, marketers, and analysts are using this to generate reports, outlines, and summaries from thousands of pages at once.

Students are using it to study entire textbooks faster.

Researchers are building specialized systems for their field.

All inside the **NotebookLM Free AI Research Tool**.



# Real-World Applications

* **Students:** Create personalized study systems and flashcards from lecture notes.
* **Researchers:** Automate literature reviews and summaries.
* **Marketers:** Analyze competitors and generate strategy reports.
* **Teachers:** Build lesson plans and quizzes automatically.
* **Writers:** Organize source material and generate outlines in one place.

NotebookLM is no longer a passive note app. It’s a **free AI research platform** that adapts to your workflow.

2. **Use specific personas.** Don’t say “be helpful.” Define exact tone, structure, and expertise.
3. **Experiment with deep research.** The more detailed your query, the better the report.

5. **Review output carefully.** AI is smart, but your expertise refines it.

1qphgw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1qphgw5/thats_when_you_know_ive_had_enough/,That’s when you know I’ve had enough,"Hey babe, I thought that might catch your attention. I know you “don’t post on here”, but I know you scroll quite a bit. This is for you my love.

Early morning, coffee brewing, Bible study playing as I take notes and consume every word as if it is meant for us. The outside world still sleeps, but my heart is wide awake. We’ve walked through shadows these last months; said words that cut deeper than we meant, silences that stretched like cold winter nights, obstacles we didn’t see coming until they bruised us both. The bed felt too wide, the silence deafening, and some days I wondered if my love could bend without breaking.

But God,faithful and steady,God.

He didn’t let the storm have the last word.

In the ache, He whispered promises I’d forgotten:

“I am with you… I will strengthen you… I will uphold you.”

He reminded me that trials aren’t the end; they’re the forge where faith is hammered strong again.

We stumbled, yes. We fell hard.

Yet here we are, reaching—not for what was lost, but for what He’s rebuilding.

I see it in the small things: your hand finding mine across the table, a shared prayer that lingers longer than before, the way forgiveness feels lighter when we lean on grace together.

Morning light spills across the floor now, the same floor where our shadows once danced freely, then faltered.

Today it feels like promise instead of memory. The sun rises without asking permission, and so does hope.  God’s hope, stubborn and bright, pouring gold over every crack we thought would stay broken. We’re not pretending the scars aren’t there.

We carry them, but we carry them forward; hand in hand, hearts turned upward.

I still love you, not just in past tense,but in the present miracle of renewal.

We’re learning to trust again: in each other’s imperfect steps, in the God who makes all things new, who turns mourning into morning and weakness into strength we never had alone.

Philippians 4:13 isn’t just a verse anymore. It’s the rhythm we’re choosing to walk in: “I can do all this through him who gives me strength.”

Together.  With Him. One faithful day at a time.

Our heartbeats settling into place and peace.

Time keeps moving, and so do we.

Toward healing, toward each other,

toward the God who never stopped holding us both. ",2,1769620582.0,LoveLetters,1,1.0,False

Alternative Title: Occasionally street-smart woman looking to adopt an enthu nerd.,"The Basics:

Age/Height: 33 / 5'2""

Education: BBA - HR

Location: Bangalore (with NCR roots)

Profession: Talent Acquisition

Salary: 22 LPA

Habits: Non-smoker, Eggetarian

About Me:

I’m a 33-year-old woman who finds a lot of joy in the balance between my traditional roots and my progressive outlook. I grew up in a close-knit, supportive family, moving across several cities (primarily Delhi NCR) before landing in Bangalore.

Personality & Interests:

I love making people laugh—sometimes at the cost of self-deprecation, oversharing, and just being silly. I have a lot of ""cross-functional"" interests; I might be bad at most of them, but I love them.

I love my plants, spatial designing, and walking miles. I host friends for dinner often, explore new coffee places, and hit up events in town. Recently, I’ve started sketching, pottery, and learning about the Universe. I used to travel quite often—I've explored a good bit of India and some ""chotu"" countries too.

When I hibernate, I recalibrate by binge-watching sitcoms or reading Cosmos by Carl Sagan. Also, I think I’m slightly above everyone else because I choose to brain-rot on Twitter instead of Instagram. ;)

My Preference & Vision:

I envision life with a partner as a long giggle in a child's voice. I’m looking for a genuine partnership with someone who knows how to show up as a partner, not a ""passenger"" and I promise I will make the life worthwile for you :)

I would also need some help with that Carl Sagan book (I am a total Darsheel Safary when it comes to the technical stuff).

My Ideal Partner (on paper):

Age: 31+

Salary: 20 LPA+

Location (in order of pref): Bangalore / Pune / Hyderabad / NCR / Mumbai

Habits: Non-smoker

Bonus points: Ambitious in life and pro in dealing with househelp.

1qphe1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/I_DONT_LIKE/comments/1qphe1t/idl_how_public_seating_assumes_everyone_is_light/,"IDL how public seating assumes everyone is light and flexible while some of us are carrying the weight of groceries, laptops, and life itself","Yesterday afternoon I walked into a café and immediately noticed the chairs. Slim, delicate, perfectly spaced like they expected everyone to float in and balance effortlessly. Me? I had a tote bag on one arm, a laptop bag on the other, and my coffee precariously perched. Trying to sit down without knocking over the table felt like auditioning for a circus act.

It made me realize this isn’t just about chairs. Public spaces everywhere quietly assume a default human. Unencumbered, agile, and perfectly suited to the design. If you don’t match that invisible standard, you constantly adapt, contort, and improvise.

Globally, millions of people face these silent barriers daily. It’s absurd, and it’s exhausting, and the fact that this is “normal” is worth questioning. Maybe a better approach is obvious but ignored.

Wider chairs, thoughtful spacing, layouts that consider people who carry bags, groceries, strollers, or bodies that don’t fit the idealized mold. It’s not revolutionary. It’s basic respect.

1qphdxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qphdxy/i_thought_my_brothers_number_one_rule_was_just_a/,"I thought my brother's number one rule was just a symptom of his anxiety. I was wrong, and now I'm hiding in my room.","I don’t know how much time I have. I’ve called the police, but I live on the edge of town, and the dispatcher sounded… skeptical. She said they’d send a car for a wellness check. A wellness check. I can hear it outside my bedroom door, and I don't think ""wellness"" is on its mind.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know. I need the sequence of events to be recorded, because if they find me, I don’t think the scene will make any sense. And if they don’t find my brother… well, I don’t want to think about that.

It all started three months ago when my life took a nosedive. The kind of spectacular, cinematic failure that you see in movies but never think will happen to you. I lost my job, and then, in a cascade of bad luck and worse decisions, I lost my apartment. I had nowhere to go. My parents are gone, and my friends are scattered, most of them struggling themselves. There was only one option left: my younger brother.

He lives in a small, two-bedroom rental at the very last stop of civilization before the woods begin. The kind of house that’s cheap for a reason. He was happy to have me, of course. We’ve always been close, even more so after our parents passed. I was supposed to be the one looking out for him, the stable older brother. The irony was a bitter pill to swallow as I moved my life, crammed into three cardboard boxes and a duffel bag, into his spare room.

I knew he had issues. He’d never been the same since the accident.

About five years ago, he was driving cross-country. A solo trip to ""find himself,"" as you do in your early twenties. Somewhere in the vast, empty expanse of the desert, he fell asleep at the wheel. The car went off the road and flipped, multiple times. He was lucky to be alive, a fact the state trooper who found the wreckage the next morning repeated to him like a mantra.

But he wasn't found by the trooper. Not at first.

The first few hours after the crash were a blur to him. He remembers crawling out of the mangled steel, the world upside down, bleeding and disoriented. The sun was setting, painting the sky in violent shades of orange and purple. He was miles from anywhere, the highway a silent, empty ribbon. He thought he was going to die out there. And then he saw a figure, walking toward him from the direction of the distant, flat-topped mesas.

He couldn’t describe the man clearly. Old, he said. Skin like cracked leather, long, dark hair braided with things that glinted in the dying light. He carried a staff. A shaman, a medicine man, something out of a forgotten history book. My brother was delirious, convinced he was hallucinating from blood loss. This man, he said, tended to his wounds with strange-smelling poultices and gave him water from a clay jug that tasted of dirt and minerals. He spoke in a language my brother didn't understand, a series of clicks and soft, guttural sounds. But my brother said he understood him perfectly in his head.

The old man told him he was lucky. He said something had been drawn to the violence of the crash, something that lingered in those empty places. He had intervened. He had performed a ritual to bind my brother’s life force, to keep it from slipping away into the sand. But such things, the man had conveyed, always have a price. He had anchored my brother to the living world, but the anchor had a chain.

The final thing my brother remembers the man telling him before he passed out was this: *You have been saved, but you will not go home alone.*

When he woke up, the sun was rising, and the state trooper was shining a flashlight in his eyes. There was no sign of the old man. Just a single, dark feather lying on the car’s dashboard.

The doctors chalked it all up to trauma. A concussion-induced hallucination. A coping mechanism his brain created to deal with a near-death experience. And I believed them. It was the logical, sensible explanation.

But the accident left him with more than just a story. He came back… changed. He developed a crippling claustrophobia. He couldn't be in elevators, or small rooms without windows. He’d have panic attacks in crowded movie theaters. And he developed the nightmares. Every single night, he had terrible, vivid nightmares. He’d wake up screaming sometimes, drenched in sweat, his heart hammering against his ribs.

And then there was the window.

His bedroom window, the one that looked out onto the dense, dark woods behind the house, had to be open, and I mean wide open. All the time. When he was sleeping, the curtain would be drawn, but the window behind it was always slid as far as it would go. It didn’t matter if it was a pleasant summer evening or the dead of a freezing winter. That window was open.

When I first moved in, I thought it was just a quirk, a part of his anxiety. Fresh air, the illusion of an escape route, whatever. I’d wake up in the morning and the whole house would be frigid. I’d find a thin layer of frost on the kitchen counter. I’d see my breath in the hallway. I complained, I reasoned, I begged.

“I can’t,” he’d say, his face pale and drawn. “I just… I can’t close it. I can’t breathe if it’s closed.”

I felt guilty for pushing, so I let it go. I bought a thicker duvet. I wore sweaters around the house. I accepted it as part of the price of living with him. It was his house, his rules. I was just the freeloader brother crashing on his charity.

The first month was fine, or as fine as things could be. I was looking for work, he was going to his part-time job at the local library. The house was cold, and he was still having nightmares, but it was a stable routine.

Then things started to get worse.

His nightmares became more intense. I could hear him through the thin walls, whimpering and thrashing in his sleep. Sometimes he’d talk, short, choked-off phrases. “Go away… don’t look at me… not here…” One night, I heard him say something so clearly it made the hair on my arms stand up: “It’s in the trees again. The tall man.”

When I asked him about it the next morning, he just shook his head, his eyes wide and haunted. “It’s just dreams,” he’d mutter, but he wouldn’t meet my gaze. He said the dreams were always the same. He was in his bed, in his room, but he was paralyzed. And through his open window, standing just at the edge of the woods where the moonlight couldn’t quite reach, was a figure. Tall. Impossibly thin, like a line of ink drawn against the darkness. It never moved, it never did anything. It just watched him.

I told him it was stress. My moving in, his own anxieties. I suggested therapy again. He refused, just as he always did.

Around the same time, the small, inexplicable things started happening.

It began with my keys. I always leave them in the ceramic bowl by the front door. One morning, they were gone. We tore the house apart looking for them. I found them three days later inside the freezer, nestled between a bag of frozen peas and an ice tray. I laughed it off, blamed my own stressed-out mind for doing something so stupid.

Then it was the TV remote. It vanished from the coffee table and reappeared on top of the bathroom medicine cabinet. My brother’s library card showed up inside my shoe. It was annoying, a series of frustrating little mysteries that we both blamed on each other’s absentmindedness, on the general chaos of two adults sharing a small space. But it felt… wrong. There was a subtle malice to it, a feeling of being toyed with.

Then came the scratching.

It was always at night, usually around 3 a.m. A faint, scuttling sound from inside the walls. My first thought was mice, or squirrels. I bought traps, put them in the attic and the crawl space. They remained empty, the bait untouched. The sound continued. It wasn't the frantic scrabbling of a rodent. It was slower, more deliberate. A dry, rasping sound, like a long fingernail being dragged across drywall. It would start in the wall of the living room, then move to the hallway, sometimes seeming to come from the ceiling right above my bed. My brother claimed he couldn’t hear it over the sound of the wind coming through his open window. I think he was lying. I think he just didn’t want to hear it.

The most unsettling thing, though, was the dirt.

Because his window was always open, leaves and dust and bits of debris from the woods would blow into his room. Every morning, part of his routine was to sweep up the small pile that had accumulated on the floor beneath the sill. One morning, I woke up before him and went to make coffee. I glanced into his room as I passed, and what I saw made me stop.

The scattered leaves and dust on his floor were arranged in a pattern. A distinct, intricate spiral, coiling outwards from a central point. It was too perfect to be natural, too deliberate to be a trick of the wind. It looked like one of those sand mandalas, but made of dead leaves and grit.

I stared at it for a long time, a cold dread coiling in my stomach. When my brother came out of the bathroom, he saw me looking. He just sighed, a weary, defeated sound, and went to get the dustpan. He didn't act surprised. He just swept it up without a word, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

I saw it again a week later. And then again. It was never the same twice, sometimes a simple spiral, sometimes a more complex, web-like design, but it was always there on windy nights. The wind, I told myself. It has to be some kind of bizarre vortex effect caused by the airflow in the house. A freak of physics. But I didn't believe it. Not really. I started to feel like I was a guest in a house that had its own secret life, its own quiet, creeping madness.

My patience began to fray. The constant cold was seeping into my bones. The nightly scratching was wrecking my sleep. I was on edge, irritable, and my job search was going nowhere, which only made things worse. I looked at my brother, with his hollowed-out eyes and perpetual shiver, and I saw the source of the misery that had permeated the house. I saw his open window as a gaping wound, letting in the cold, and all this… strangeness.

I became obsessed with that window. I felt that if I could just close it, everything would go back to normal. The cold would stop. The drafts would stop. The leaves and their disturbing patterns would stop. The scratching would stop. My brother’s nightmares… maybe they would stop, too. Maybe being in a warm, secure room would finally make him feel safe.

I was a rational person. I believed in science, in cause and effect. I was convinced that all of this : the paranoia, the misplaced objects, the sounds, was a psychological symptom of our shared stress, amplified by the physically uncomfortable environment he was forcing on us. Close the window, warm the house, and the ""haunting"" would disappear. It was simple.

Yesterday was the final straw. I woke up after a particularly bad night. The scratching had been louder than ever, and I’d heard my brother crying in his sleep. I stumbled out of my room, shivering, and found a new pattern on his floor. It wasn’t a spiral this time. It was a long, thin shape, like a stick figure, but with arms that were too long and fingers that were like rakes. It was made of pine needles and black soil.

I just stared at it, and a rage I hadn't felt in years boiled up inside me. It was so profoundly, deeply *wrong*.

My brother was at work. He wouldn’t be home for hours. I knew he’d be furious. I knew it would be a betrayal of his trust, of the one rule he had in his own home. I didn’t care.

I walked into his room. The cold air hit me. It smelled of damp earth and decaying leaves. I could see the trees outside, dark and skeletal against the grey sky. I went to the window, my hands trembling with a mixture of anger and a strange fear. The frame was icy to the touch. With a grunt of effort, I shoved it down. The rattling slam as it shut was the most satisfying sound I’d ever heard. I flipped the lock, a stiff, metallic click that echoed in the sudden, profound silence of the room. For good measure, I pulled the thick curtain fully across it, hiding the grey light of the day.

The effect was instantaneous. The room, for the first time since I’d arrived, felt like a part of the house. The oppressive, wild presence of the outdoors was gone. I stood there for a moment, breathing in the still, quiet air. I felt a sense of triumph. I had fixed it. I had finally taken control.

My brother came home late that evening. He seemed tired, but in a normal way. He didn’t mention the window. We ate dinner, watched some TV. The house was warm. It was peaceful. It felt like home. For the first time in months, I felt like things were going to be okay. When he went to bed, he just said, “Goodnight,” and closed his door. He didn’t notice. The curtain was drawn, and he was too wrapped up in his own world.

I went to my own room feeling vindicated, even a little smug. I fell asleep faster than I had in a long time, cocooned in the comforting warmth and silence.

The screaming is what woke me up.

It was raw, primal terror. A sound of pure agony that ripped through the quiet house. I was out of bed before I was even fully awake, my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest. I ran to his door and wrenched the handle. Locked.

""Hey! Hey, what's wrong?"" I yelled, pounding my fist on the wood.

His screams dissolved into gasping, choking sobs. ""I can't—! It won't—! Can't breathe!""

""Open the door!"" I shouted, jiggling the knob frantically. ""Just open the door!""

""No! Stay out!"" he shrieked, his voice cracking with a new kind of panic. ""Oh god, what did you do? *What did you do?*""

""I don't know what you're talking about! Let me in!""

""The window!"" he wailed, and the sound was so full of despair it froze my blood. ""You closed the window! I can feel it! You closed it!""

A sudden, violent bang rattled the door in its frame, as if he’d thrown his entire body against it. Then another. 

""It was cold!"" I yelled back, my voice shaking. ""It was just a window!""

His reply was a choked, gurgling laugh that was the most terrifying sound I have ever heard. ""A window? You think it was for *me*? You idiot!  It was for *it* to get out!""

The rational part of my brain was short-circuiting, unable to process what he was saying. It felt like the floor was tilting beneath my feet.

""What are you talking about? What is 'it'?""

""The man in the trees!"" he screamed. ""The price! He told me! He told me I wouldn't go home alone! It followed me! It's always been with me!""

The story from the desert came rushing back. The shaman. The price. The anchor with a chain.

I could hear him scrambling away from the door, his breath coming in ragged, wet hitches. ""The nightmares… that's where it lived,"" he gasped, his voice sounding farther away now, as if he was huddled in the corner of the room. ""In my head. In my sleep. It was… contained. It could look out, through the window. It could leave for a little while. The open air… it gave it an escape. A way to dissipate.""

Another slam against the door, harder this time. The wood groaned. I backed away, my hand flying to my mouth.

""You closed it,"" he whispered, his voice trembling with a terror that was beyond human. ""You locked it in. You sealed the room. Now it has nowhere to go. It was in my head, but now… now it wants out.""

I heard a dry, splintering crack from inside. Not the door. Something else. It sounded like bone. My brother let out a thin, reedy whimper that was abruptly cut off.

And then, silence.

A deep, heavy, absolute silence that was worse than the screaming.

""Hey?"" I whispered, my voice a pathetic squeak. ""Are you okay?""

No answer.

I stood there in the dark hallway for what felt like an eternity, my ear pressed against the cold wood of his door. The house was silent. The house was warm.

Then I heard the scratching.

It was on the other side of the door this time. Right there, and it wasn't the sound of my brother's fingernails, but a slow, deliberate. A deep, gouging scrape, like something hard and sharp was being dragged down the wood, leaving a furrow behind. Scraaaaaape. Pause. Scraaaaaape.

I stumbled backwards, my legs like water. I ran into my room and slammed the door, fumbling with the lock. My hands were shaking so hard it took me three tries. I shoved my desk chair under the knob.

I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. I babbled something about a break-in, a home invasion, my brother screaming. The dispatcher’s calm, professional voice was an anchor in a swirling sea of madness. She told me to stay on the line, to stay in a secure room.

The scratching on his door stopped.

I held my breath, listening. The silence stretched. Maybe it was over. Maybe he’d passed out. Maybe I was having a psychotic break.

Then the scratching started on *my* door.

It’s right there. Right now, as I’m typing this with trembling fingers. It is methodical. Patient. It’s testing the door, finding the seams. Scraaaaaape. Scraaaaape. It’s lower down than a person would scratch. Near the floor.

The scratching has stopped again. I can hear a soft, wet, sliding sound. Something is pressing against the bottom of the door. The gap is small, maybe half an inch.

Oh god.

I can see it.

From the thin crack of darkness beneath my door, a finger is sliding into my room. It’s pale grey, the color of dead flesh or old birch bark. It's too long. Far, far too long. The knuckle is bent at an impossible angle to fit through the gap. It’s thin, unnaturally so, like a stretched-out piece of taffy. Another one is coming through now, alongside the first. They are twitching, questing, feeling the carpet. They are followed by another. And another. They don’t look like fingers anymore. They look like the legs of some colorless insect.

They're moving so slowly. Deliberately, then the tips of these… things started tapping, gently, on the inside of my door.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

1qphdhl,https://v.redd.it/1zr1wjiyh4gg1,"Did I break my machine? [delonghi stilosa, breville smart grinder]","Been working on dialing in and finally got to the point with my grinder where I was dispensing about 19g on grind setting 8 (goes from 1-40 in size, I started at 12 and went finer) in order to pull \~40g shots in 30 seconds. My portafilter is not completely full once I tamp, and I use a puck screen as well. When I twist the portafilter on, it’s a pretty tight fit.

One day, I must have accidentally done a little too much coffee, because when trying to extract nothing came out. I started over with a little less coffee, but then I noticed that my machine started spraying water out the top of the portafilter and no coffee was extracting.

I took the advice of other people to go coarser on my grind, but now I’m all the way up to grind size 14 and the machine is still spewing water everywhere. The portafilter no longer tightens into the machine the way it did. There’s nothing wrong with the rubber gasket, we took the machine apart to check. When dispensing water only, there’s no leakage. But when I add coffee, the water pressure causes the portafilter to shift which is where I suspect the leaking is coming from. In the attached video, you can see it, it’s subtle but the portafilter moves just as the coffee comes out, then you see the water spraying. 

I’m at a loss and wondering how 1 poor extraction could’ve messed up the machine this bad. Do I just have a crappy machine and should upgrade? Is there a fix for this?",1,1769620389.0,espresso,13,0.67,False

I was wrong, and now I'm hiding in my room.","I don’t know how much time I have. I’ve called the police, but I live on the edge of town, and the dispatcher sounded… skeptical. She said they’d send a car for a wellness check. A wellness check. I can hear it outside my bedroom door, and I don't think ""wellness"" is on its mind.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know. I need the sequence of events to be recorded, because if they find me, I don’t think the scene will make any sense. And if they don’t find my brother… well, I don’t want to think about that.

It all started three months ago when my life took a nosedive. The kind of spectacular, cinematic failure that you see in movies but never think will happen to you. I lost my job, and then, in a cascade of bad luck and worse decisions, I lost my apartment. I had nowhere to go. My parents are gone, and my friends are scattered, most of them struggling themselves. There was only one option left: my younger brother.

He lives in a small, two-bedroom rental at the very last stop of civilization before the woods begin. The kind of house that’s cheap for a reason. He was happy to have me, of course. We’ve always been close, even more so after our parents passed. I was supposed to be the one looking out for him, the stable older brother. The irony was a bitter pill to swallow as I moved my life, crammed into three cardboard boxes and a duffel bag, into his spare room.

I knew he had issues. He’d never been the same since the accident.

About five years ago, he was driving cross-country. A solo trip to ""find himself,"" as you do in your early twenties. Somewhere in the vast, empty expanse of the desert, he fell asleep at the wheel. The car went off the road and flipped, multiple times. He was lucky to be alive, a fact the state trooper who found the wreckage the next morning repeated to him like a mantra.

But he wasn't found by the trooper. Not at first.

The first few hours after the crash were a blur to him. He remembers crawling out of the mangled steel, the world upside down, bleeding and disoriented. The sun was setting, painting the sky in violent shades of orange and purple. He was miles from anywhere, the highway a silent, empty ribbon. He thought he was going to die out there. And then he saw a figure, walking toward him from the direction of the distant, flat-topped mesas.

He couldn’t describe the man clearly. Old, he said. Skin like cracked leather, long, dark hair braided with things that glinted in the dying light. He carried a staff. A shaman, a medicine man, something out of a forgotten history book. My brother was delirious, convinced he was hallucinating from blood loss. This man, he said, tended to his wounds with strange-smelling poultices and gave him water from a clay jug that tasted of dirt and minerals. He spoke in a language my brother didn't understand, a series of clicks and soft, guttural sounds. But my brother said he understood him perfectly in his head.

The old man told him he was lucky. He said something had been drawn to the violence of the crash, something that lingered in those empty places. He had intervened. He had performed a ritual to bind my brother’s life force, to keep it from slipping away into the sand. But such things, the man had conveyed, always have a price. He had anchored my brother to the living world, but the anchor had a chain.

The final thing my brother remembers the man telling him before he passed out was this: *You have been saved, but you will not go home alone.*

When he woke up, the sun was rising, and the state trooper was shining a flashlight in his eyes. There was no sign of the old man. Just a single, dark feather lying on the car’s dashboard.

The doctors chalked it all up to trauma. A concussion-induced hallucination. A coping mechanism his brain created to deal with a near-death experience. And I believed them. It was the logical, sensible explanation.

But the accident left him with more than just a story. He came back… changed. He developed a crippling claustrophobia. He couldn't be in elevators, or small rooms without windows. He’d have panic attacks in crowded movie theaters. And he developed the nightmares. Every single night, he had terrible, vivid nightmares. He’d wake up screaming sometimes, drenched in sweat, his heart hammering against his ribs.

And then there was the window.

His bedroom window, the one that looked out onto the dense, dark woods behind the house, had to be open, and I mean wide open. All the time. When he was sleeping, the curtain would be drawn, but the window behind it was always slid as far as it would go. It didn’t matter if it was a pleasant summer evening or the dead of a freezing winter. That window was open.

When I first moved in, I thought it was just a quirk, a part of his anxiety. Fresh air, the illusion of an escape route, whatever. I’d wake up in the morning and the whole house would be frigid. I’d find a thin layer of frost on the kitchen counter. I’d see my breath in the hallway. I complained, I reasoned, I begged.

“I can’t,” he’d say, his face pale and drawn. “I just… I can’t close it. I can’t breathe if it’s closed.”

I felt guilty for pushing, so I let it go. I bought a thicker duvet. I wore sweaters around the house. I accepted it as part of the price of living with him. It was his house, his rules. I was just the freeloader brother crashing on his charity.

The first month was fine, or as fine as things could be. I was looking for work, he was going to his part-time job at the local library. The house was cold, and he was still having nightmares, but it was a stable routine.

Then things started to get worse.

His nightmares became more intense. I could hear him through the thin walls, whimpering and thrashing in his sleep. Sometimes he’d talk, short, choked-off phrases. “Go away… don’t look at me… not here…” One night, I heard him say something so clearly it made the hair on my arms stand up: “It’s in the trees again. The tall man.”

When I asked him about it the next morning, he just shook his head, his eyes wide and haunted. “It’s just dreams,” he’d mutter, but he wouldn’t meet my gaze. He said the dreams were always the same. He was in his bed, in his room, but he was paralyzed. And through his open window, standing just at the edge of the woods where the moonlight couldn’t quite reach, was a figure. Tall. Impossibly thin, like a line of ink drawn against the darkness. It never moved, it never did anything. It just watched him.

I told him it was stress. My moving in, his own anxieties. I suggested therapy again. He refused, just as he always did.

Around the same time, the small, inexplicable things started happening.

It began with my keys. I always leave them in the ceramic bowl by the front door. One morning, they were gone. We tore the house apart looking for them. I found them three days later inside the freezer, nestled between a bag of frozen peas and an ice tray. I laughed it off, blamed my own stressed-out mind for doing something so stupid.

Then it was the TV remote. It vanished from the coffee table and reappeared on top of the bathroom medicine cabinet. My brother’s library card showed up inside my shoe. It was annoying, a series of frustrating little mysteries that we both blamed on each other’s absentmindedness, on the general chaos of two adults sharing a small space. But it felt… wrong. There was a subtle malice to it, a feeling of being toyed with.

Then came the scratching.

It was always at night, usually around 3 a.m. A faint, scuttling sound from inside the walls. My first thought was mice, or squirrels. I bought traps, put them in the attic and the crawl space. They remained empty, the bait untouched. The sound continued. It wasn't the frantic scrabbling of a rodent. It was slower, more deliberate. A dry, rasping sound, like a long fingernail being dragged across drywall. It would start in the wall of the living room, then move to the hallway, sometimes seeming to come from the ceiling right above my bed. My brother claimed he couldn’t hear it over the sound of the wind coming through his open window. I think he was lying. I think he just didn’t want to hear it.

The most unsettling thing, though, was the dirt.

Because his window was always open, leaves and dust and bits of debris from the woods would blow into his room. Every morning, part of his routine was to sweep up the small pile that had accumulated on the floor beneath the sill. One morning, I woke up before him and went to make coffee. I glanced into his room as I passed, and what I saw made me stop.

The scattered leaves and dust on his floor were arranged in a pattern. A distinct, intricate spiral, coiling outwards from a central point. It was too perfect to be natural, too deliberate to be a trick of the wind. It looked like one of those sand mandalas, but made of dead leaves and grit.

I stared at it for a long time, a cold dread coiling in my stomach. When my brother came out of the bathroom, he saw me looking. He just sighed, a weary, defeated sound, and went to get the dustpan.

1qphcp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qphcp1/i_thought_my_brothers_number_one_rule_was_just_a/,"I thought my brother's number one rule was just a symptom of his anxiety. I was wrong, and now I'm hiding in my room.","I don’t know how much time I have. I’ve called the police, but I live on the edge of town, and the dispatcher sounded… skeptical. She said they’d send a car for a wellness check. A wellness check. I can hear it outside my bedroom door, and I don't think ""wellness"" is on its mind.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know. I need the sequence of events to be recorded, because if they find me, I don’t think the scene will make any sense. And if they don’t find my brother… well, I don’t want to think about that.

It all started three months ago when my life took a nosedive. The kind of spectacular, cinematic failure that you see in movies but never think will happen to you. I lost my job, and then, in a cascade of bad luck and worse decisions, I lost my apartment. I had nowhere to go. My parents are gone, and my friends are scattered, most of them struggling themselves. There was only one option left: my younger brother.

He lives in a small, two-bedroom rental at the very last stop of civilization before the woods begin. The kind of house that’s cheap for a reason. He was happy to have me, of course. We’ve always been close, even more so after our parents passed. I was supposed to be the one looking out for him, the stable older brother. The irony was a bitter pill to swallow as I moved my life, crammed into three cardboard boxes and a duffel bag, into his spare room.

I knew he had issues. He’d never been the same since the accident.

About five years ago, he was driving cross-country. A solo trip to ""find himself,"" as you do in your early twenties. Somewhere in the vast, empty expanse of the desert, he fell asleep at the wheel. The car went off the road and flipped, multiple times. He was lucky to be alive, a fact the state trooper who found the wreckage the next morning repeated to him like a mantra.

But he wasn't found by the trooper. Not at first.

The first few hours after the crash were a blur to him. He remembers crawling out of the mangled steel, the world upside down, bleeding and disoriented. The sun was setting, painting the sky in violent shades of orange and purple. He was miles from anywhere, the highway a silent, empty ribbon. He thought he was going to die out there. And then he saw a figure, walking toward him from the direction of the distant, flat-topped mesas.

He couldn’t describe the man clearly. Old, he said. Skin like cracked leather, long, dark hair braided with things that glinted in the dying light. He carried a staff. A shaman, a medicine man, something out of a forgotten history book. My brother was delirious, convinced he was hallucinating from blood loss. This man, he said, tended to his wounds with strange-smelling poultices and gave him water from a clay jug that tasted of dirt and minerals. He spoke in a language my brother didn't understand, a series of clicks and soft, guttural sounds. But my brother said he understood him perfectly in his head.

The old man told him he was lucky. He said something had been drawn to the violence of the crash, something that lingered in those empty places. He had intervened. He had performed a ritual to bind my brother’s life force, to keep it from slipping away into the sand. But such things, the man had conveyed, always have a price. He had anchored my brother to the living world, but the anchor had a chain.

The final thing my brother remembers the man telling him before he passed out was this: *You have been saved, but you will not go home alone.*

When he woke up, the sun was rising, and the state trooper was shining a flashlight in his eyes. There was no sign of the old man. Just a single, dark feather lying on the car’s dashboard.

The doctors chalked it all up to trauma. A concussion-induced hallucination. A coping mechanism his brain created to deal with a near-death experience. And I believed them. It was the logical, sensible explanation.

But the accident left him with more than just a story. He came back… changed. He developed a crippling claustrophobia. He couldn't be in elevators, or small rooms without windows. He’d have panic attacks in crowded movie theaters. And he developed the nightmares. Every single night, he had terrible, vivid nightmares. He’d wake up screaming sometimes, drenched in sweat, his heart hammering against his ribs.

And then there was the window.

His bedroom window, the one that looked out onto the dense, dark woods behind the house, had to be open, and I mean wide open. All the time. When he was sleeping, the curtain would be drawn, but the window behind it was always slid as far as it would go. It didn’t matter if it was a pleasant summer evening or the dead of a freezing winter. That window was open.

When I first moved in, I thought it was just a quirk, a part of his anxiety. Fresh air, the illusion of an escape route, whatever. I’d wake up in the morning and the whole house would be frigid. I’d find a thin layer of frost on the kitchen counter. I’d see my breath in the hallway. I complained, I reasoned, I begged.

“I can’t,” he’d say, his face pale and drawn. “I just… I can’t close it. I can’t breathe if it’s closed.”

I felt guilty for pushing, so I let it go. I bought a thicker duvet. I wore sweaters around the house. I accepted it as part of the price of living with him. It was his house, his rules. I was just the freeloader brother crashing on his charity.

The first month was fine, or as fine as things could be. I was looking for work, he was going to his part-time job at the local library. The house was cold, and he was still having nightmares, but it was a stable routine.

Then things started to get worse.

His nightmares became more intense. I could hear him through the thin walls, whimpering and thrashing in his sleep. Sometimes he’d talk, short, choked-off phrases. “Go away… don’t look at me… not here…” One night, I heard him say something so clearly it made the hair on my arms stand up: “It’s in the trees again. The tall man.”

When I asked him about it the next morning, he just shook his head, his eyes wide and haunted. “It’s just dreams,” he’d mutter, but he wouldn’t meet my gaze. He said the dreams were always the same. He was in his bed, in his room, but he was paralyzed. And through his open window, standing just at the edge of the woods where the moonlight couldn’t quite reach, was a figure. Tall. Impossibly thin, like a line of ink drawn against the darkness. It never moved, it never did anything. It just watched him.

I told him it was stress. My moving in, his own anxieties. I suggested therapy again. He refused, just as he always did.

Around the same time, the small, inexplicable things started happening.

It began with my keys. I always leave them in the ceramic bowl by the front door. One morning, they were gone. We tore the house apart looking for them. I found them three days later inside the freezer, nestled between a bag of frozen peas and an ice tray. I laughed it off, blamed my own stressed-out mind for doing something so stupid.

Then it was the TV remote. It vanished from the coffee table and reappeared on top of the bathroom medicine cabinet. My brother’s library card showed up inside my shoe. It was annoying, a series of frustrating little mysteries that we both blamed on each other’s absentmindedness, on the general chaos of two adults sharing a small space. But it felt… wrong. There was a subtle malice to it, a feeling of being toyed with.

Then came the scratching.

It was always at night, usually around 3 a.m. A faint, scuttling sound from inside the walls. My first thought was mice, or squirrels. I bought traps, put them in the attic and the crawl space. They remained empty, the bait untouched. The sound continued. It wasn't the frantic scrabbling of a rodent. It was slower, more deliberate. A dry, rasping sound, like a long fingernail being dragged across drywall. It would start in the wall of the living room, then move to the hallway, sometimes seeming to come from the ceiling right above my bed. My brother claimed he couldn’t hear it over the sound of the wind coming through his open window. I think he was lying. I think he just didn’t want to hear it.

The most unsettling thing, though, was the dirt.

Because his window was always open, leaves and dust and bits of debris from the woods would blow into his room. Every morning, part of his routine was to sweep up the small pile that had accumulated on the floor beneath the sill. One morning, I woke up before him and went to make coffee. I glanced into his room as I passed, and what I saw made me stop.

The scattered leaves and dust on his floor were arranged in a pattern. A distinct, intricate spiral, coiling outwards from a central point. It was too perfect to be natural, too deliberate to be a trick of the wind. It looked like one of those sand mandalas, but made of dead leaves and grit.

I stared at it for a long time, a cold dread coiling in my stomach. When my brother came out of the bathroom, he saw me looking. He just sighed, a weary, defeated sound, and went to get the dustpan. He didn't act surprised. He just swept it up without a word, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

I saw it again a week later. And then again. It was never the same twice, sometimes a simple spiral, sometimes a more complex, web-like design, but it was always there on windy nights. The wind, I told myself. It has to be some kind of bizarre vortex effect caused by the airflow in the house. A freak of physics. But I didn't believe it. Not really. I started to feel like I was a guest in a house that had its own secret life, its own quiet, creeping madness.

My patience began to fray. The constant cold was seeping into my bones. The nightly scratching was wrecking my sleep. I was on edge, irritable, and my job search was going nowhere, which only made things worse. I looked at my brother, with his hollowed-out eyes and perpetual shiver, and I saw the source of the misery that had permeated the house. I saw his open window as a gaping wound, letting in the cold, and all this… strangeness.

I became obsessed with that window. I felt that if I could just close it, everything would go back to normal. The cold would stop. The drafts would stop. The leaves and their disturbing patterns would stop. The scratching would stop. My brother’s nightmares… maybe they would stop, too. Maybe being in a warm, secure room would finally make him feel safe.

I was a rational person. I believed in science, in cause and effect. I was convinced that all of this : the paranoia, the misplaced objects, the sounds, was a psychological symptom of our shared stress, amplified by the physically uncomfortable environment he was forcing on us. Close the window, warm the house, and the ""haunting"" would disappear. It was simple.

Yesterday was the final straw. I woke up after a particularly bad night. The scratching had been louder than ever, and I’d heard my brother crying in his sleep. I stumbled out of my room, shivering, and found a new pattern on his floor. It wasn’t a spiral this time. It was a long, thin shape, like a stick figure, but with arms that were too long and fingers that were like rakes. It was made of pine needles and black soil.

I just stared at it, and a rage I hadn't felt in years boiled up inside me. It was so profoundly, deeply *wrong*.

My brother was at work. He wouldn’t be home for hours. I knew he’d be furious. I knew it would be a betrayal of his trust, of the one rule he had in his own home. I didn’t care.

I walked into his room. The cold air hit me. It smelled of damp earth and decaying leaves. I could see the trees outside, dark and skeletal against the grey sky. I went to the window, my hands trembling with a mixture of anger and a strange fear. The frame was icy to the touch. With a grunt of effort, I shoved it down. The rattling slam as it shut was the most satisfying sound I’d ever heard. I flipped the lock, a stiff, metallic click that echoed in the sudden, profound silence of the room. For good measure, I pulled the thick curtain fully across it, hiding the grey light of the day.

The effect was instantaneous. The room, for the first time since I’d arrived, felt like a part of the house. The oppressive, wild presence of the outdoors was gone. I stood there for a moment, breathing in the still, quiet air. I felt a sense of triumph. I had fixed it. I had finally taken control.

My brother came home late that evening. He seemed tired, but in a normal way. He didn’t mention the window. We ate dinner, watched some TV. The house was warm. It was peaceful. It felt like home. For the first time in months, I felt like things were going to be okay. When he went to bed, he just said, “Goodnight,” and closed his door. He didn’t notice. The curtain was drawn, and he was too wrapped up in his own world.

I went to my own room feeling vindicated, even a little smug. I fell asleep faster than I had in a long time, cocooned in the comforting warmth and silence.

The screaming is what woke me up.

It was raw, primal terror. A sound of pure agony that ripped through the quiet house. I was out of bed before I was even fully awake, my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest. I ran to his door and wrenched the handle. Locked.

""Hey! Hey, what's wrong?"" I yelled, pounding my fist on the wood.

His screams dissolved into gasping, choking sobs. ""I can't—! It won't—! Can't breathe!""

""Open the door!"" I shouted, jiggling the knob frantically. ""Just open the door!""

""No! Stay out!"" he shrieked, his voice cracking with a new kind of panic. ""Oh god, what did you do? *What did you do?*""

""I don't know what you're talking about! Let me in!""

""The window!"" he wailed, and the sound was so full of despair it froze my blood. ""You closed the window! I can feel it! You closed it!""

A sudden, violent bang rattled the door in its frame, as if he’d thrown his entire body against it. Then another. 

""It was cold!"" I yelled back, my voice shaking. ""It was just a window!""

His reply was a choked, gurgling laugh that was the most terrifying sound I have ever heard. ""A window? You think it was for *me*? You idiot!  It was for *it* to get out!""

The rational part of my brain was short-circuiting, unable to process what he was saying. It felt like the floor was tilting beneath my feet.

""What are you talking about? What is 'it'?""

""The man in the trees!"" he screamed. ""The price! He told me! He told me I wouldn't go home alone! It followed me! It's always been with me!""

The story from the desert came rushing back. The shaman. The price. The anchor with a chain.

I could hear him scrambling away from the door, his breath coming in ragged, wet hitches. ""The nightmares… that's where it lived,"" he gasped, his voice sounding farther away now, as if he was huddled in the corner of the room. ""In my head. In my sleep. It was… contained. It could look out, through the window. It could leave for a little while. The open air… it gave it an escape. A way to dissipate.""

Another slam against the door, harder this time. The wood groaned. I backed away, my hand flying to my mouth.

""You closed it,"" he whispered, his voice trembling with a terror that was beyond human. ""You locked it in. You sealed the room. Now it has nowhere to go. It was in my head, but now… now it wants out.""

I heard a dry, splintering crack from inside. Not the door. Something else. It sounded like bone. My brother let out a thin, reedy whimper that was abruptly cut off.

And then, silence.

A deep, heavy, absolute silence that was worse than the screaming.

""Hey?"" I whispered, my voice a pathetic squeak. ""Are you okay?""

No answer.

I stood there in the dark hallway for what felt like an eternity, my ear pressed against the cold wood of his door. The house was silent. The house was warm.

Then I heard the scratching.

It was on the other side of the door this time. Right there, and it wasn't the sound of my brother's fingernails, but a slow, deliberate. A deep, gouging scrape, like something hard and sharp was being dragged down the wood, leaving a furrow behind. Scraaaaaape. Pause. Scraaaaaape.

I stumbled backwards, my legs like water. I ran into my room and slammed the door, fumbling with the lock. My hands were shaking so hard it took me three tries. I shoved my desk chair under the knob.

I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. I babbled something about a break-in, a home invasion, my brother screaming. The dispatcher’s calm, professional voice was an anchor in a swirling sea of madness. She told me to stay on the line, to stay in a secure room.

The scratching on his door stopped.

I held my breath, listening. The silence stretched. Maybe it was over. Maybe he’d passed out. Maybe I was having a psychotic break.

Then the scratching started on *my* door.

It’s right there. Right now, as I’m typing this with trembling fingers. It is methodical. Patient. It’s testing the door, finding the seams. Scraaaaaape. Scraaaaape. It’s lower down than a person would scratch. Near the floor.

The scratching has stopped again. I can hear a soft, wet, sliding sound. Something is pressing against the bottom of the door. The gap is small, maybe half an inch.

Oh god.

I can see it.

From the thin crack of darkness beneath my door, a finger is sliding into my room. It’s pale grey, the color of dead flesh or old birch bark. It's too long. Far, far too long. The knuckle is bent at an impossible angle to fit through the gap. It’s thin, unnaturally so, like a stretched-out piece of taffy. Another one is coming through now, alongside the first. They are twitching, questing, feeling the carpet. They are followed by another. And another. They don’t look like fingers anymore. They look like the legs of some colorless insect.

They're moving so slowly. Deliberately, then the tips of these… things started tapping, gently, on the inside of my door.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

in 1965, most of what was playing on the radio was either from the British invasion or from Motown.

along came these 4 weird/mismatched kids.

their story was, and has been fascinating to me ever since I saw them in a coffee shop in Greenwich Village. Groups had people who looked somewhat alike but not them.

Michelle Phillips was beautiful and wanted to model. Denny Doughty and John Phillips were looking for success in the Mugwumps, a folk group.

Michelle went to see them one night and started dating John Phillips. Denny was singing his ass off, and John was writing great songs. They never made it past The Village scene.

Along came the special sauce that makes special groups special, Cass Elliot.

After John convinced Michelle to give up her modeling dreams, she only wanted to be out front. Cass, on the other hand, wanted to sing behind a curtain, ashamed of her size.

An audition was arranged with Lou Adler, a famous producer. But, before that, they spent 6 months in the Virgin Islands, supposedly on Michelle's credit card.

Phillips was not sold on Cass. He was concerned about her vocal range and her appearance. He felt that her appearance would hold them back and that her vocal range didn't work for his music. He was overruled.

According to Cass, while in the islands, she was hit in the head with a metal pipe, and her range changed, so it fit perfectly in Johns songs.

When they returned to CA. they recorded their first album, aptly titled ""If You Can Believe Your Eyes And Ears,"" with a picture of them on the cover. I think that at that time, it sold the most albums ever on release. I know that I was at the record store that day (Yes, we had stores that just sold records.)

They had hit after hit from the very beginning. It wasn't just California Dreamin, although that was the first. Go Where You Wanna Go, Monday  Monday, Dream a Little Dream of Me and a history of their friends Creeque Alley.

Neither Michelle nor John were sorry that they had given up their objections.

Michelle, John, and Denny could've made a fairly good trio, but with Cass, they became Rock & Roll Hall of Famers.

They had great success until Michelle first had an affair with Denny, for which she was forgiven, and then openly with Gene Clark of The Byrds. At that point she was fired from the band and replaced by Jill Wilson. I  saw that combination at Forest Hills, and the magic was gone.

A while later, Michelle reunited with them for a short time, but when Cass died in 1974, they were done. Cass, besides being large, was a larger than life person. She had infamous parties at her home in Laurel Canyon. At those parties, John Sebastian got together with Zal Yanovski and formed The Lovin Spoonful, and after hearing David Crosby and Stephen Stills singing a song that they were working on they were asked to sing it again. When finished, Graham Nash asked them to sing it yet again, and this time, he joined in, and CSN was born.

When Cass died, whose real name was Ellen Naomi Cohen (I had forgotten that and looked it up), a part of all her fans died. On a personal level, whenever, which is frequently, I hear her singing, over the past 56 years, there's a tear dripping down my face.",2,1769620275.0,Epilepsy_Universe,0,1.0,False

I have a 3-month-old female kitten who’s been having GI and litter box issues. She had diarrhea before I got her, which was supposedly “cured.” I’ve had her for two weeks, and she started out fine for the first couple days, but now:

	•	Stool alternates between hard, soft, and mucus diarrhea

	•	Licks her bum a lot and seems uncomfortable

	•	Has accidents when I’m not in the room (even just getting my morning coffee — she doesn’t have free-range access yet)

	•	Sometimes piddles on my lap when I come home

	•	Cries when she knows I’m home, but if I actually leave she can self-soothe

Vet ruled out UTIs (thanks to an ER visit) and infections (more tests pending). I’ve started FortiFlora probiotics, psyllium, and gabapentin PRN. Her sensitive-stomach diet is on the way. I asked the vet if I should get another kitten, and she said it would only increase her stress for now.

I’m worried this might be stress-related colitis / functional gut issues, but I’m not sure. The main question is: is this gut-related or behavioral? I don’t want a chronic non-litter-box user or a sick cat… Any advice or similar experiences would be really appreciated.",1,1769620262.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

So when I realized it’s finally Friday, I actually *exhaled* a little.

My plan for the weekend is nothing crazy, but it already feels amazing just thinking about it. I’m going to sleep in without an alarm, make a big breakfast (probably pancakes and coffee ☕🥞), and then take a long walk in the park while listening to my favorite playlist. Later, I want to finally start that book I’ve been putting off and maybe cook something new for dinner.

It might not sound wild, but sometimes a chill weekend with good food, fresh air, and zero pressure is exactly what you need. Here’s to rest, small joys, and looking forward to Monday with a little less dread 😄✌️

1qph7hz,https://i.redd.it/zp05nnsxg4gg1.jpeg,6 Months in: Why I’m glad I chose digital miners over physical hardware,"Hey everyone! As I’m moving closer to my goal of 60 TH/s, I’ve been thinking about why I actually stuck with GoMining instead of trying to set up a physical ASIC miner at home. 

**The ""Apartment Miner"" Reality**
I live in a spot where running a loud, heat-blasting ASIC just isn't an option. I know some of you guys have dedicated sheds or garages for that, but for someone like me, the digital approach has been a lifesaver.

**What I’ve been enjoying most lately:**

* **The ""One-Click"" Management:** I check my daily rewards every morning while I’m having coffee. No worrying about cooling, dust, or firmware updates.
* **The Flexibility:** Last week I talked about my strategy to hit the 25% discount. Being able to pivot between adding TH and locking GMT right from my phone is honestly underrated. 
* **Scaling without Stress:** Growing from my initial 1 TH to my current 15.27 TH has been seamless. If I had physical miners, I’d be worrying about extra power sockets and cables by now.

**Progress update:**
I’m still grinding those weekly tasks and making steady progress toward that extra 300 GMT I need for my next discount tier. It’s a marathon, not a sprint, but seeing those daily BTC sats stack up makes it worth it.

I’m curious, how many of you actually own physical miners too? Or are you guys strictly ""digital-only"" like me because of the convenience?

**Feel free to ask me anything about how the app feels or how the daily rewards work. I’ve been using it for half a year now, so I'm happy to share my experience!**

After around 10 days, I suddenly got the opposite effect. Brain fog, lethargy, concentration and memory problems all worse than without meds. I also suddenly craved sugar like crazy.
I tried upping the dose to 20-20 and even tried 30 once but nothing changed. Thought it was because of my luteal phase.
I stopped taking the med until a few days before my next appointment where I was prescribed 50 to try and also split again if I want.
The two days before the appointment were alright with 15-15 again. Had some minor brain fog an hour after the second dose but that went away. I drank coffee those two days in the morning and once in the afternoon. All medicated days before and after I didn't combine caffeine with the med.
I then tried to up to 25-25 and 35-15 and that was alright too, little clearer even. Then I tried 50 in the morning. I was hyperfixated so much on details that I couldn't get anything done and my thoughts were racing so I guess that was too much. I got frustrated at 12 and crashed very hard at 2pm.

I’ve been reading so many great posts here about things to do in Vancouver. 1-day itineraries, hiking, long walks, etc. I’m visiting in late May with my mom, but we’ll only have **one full day**, and she’s **not super mobile**. And most of what I see involves a lot of walking.

She won’t be in a wheelchair, but she’s still recovering from hip surgery and sometimes uses a cane when she gets tired. She loves to explore, but long stretches of walking are tough, and she’s also a bit afraid of heights. She’s curious about the suspension bridges, but I can’t guarantee she’d want to go on one or feel comfortable crossing it. And again, i'm not saying she can't walk. But one long walk will be the end of the day for her. So it would have to be worth it!

As for me — I live in New York City and used to work in tourism here, so I'm usually on the lookout for things that are less crowded and not too touristy. Or if it's something we already have here i'd rather just relax with her over coffee and people watch rather than fight through crowds.

We’re staying at the Fairmont Pacific Rim downtown. What would you recommend for one easy, low-key day with someone who can’t walk a ton and is afraid of heights?

I know this is a tall order between us! Ideas that would be perfect:

* An easy morning activity + easy afternoon activity
* Places where you can sit, relax, and people-watch
* Areas with shops close together
* A jaw dropping exhibit in a museum/gallery
* Transportation options (boat, bus, scenic ride, etc.) that let you take in the sights without a lot of walking

Once it’s strained, I screw the lid on the mason jar and flip it upside down while it finishes cooling.

Any tiny bits of moisture or “funky stuff” that might’ve slipped through will settle toward the lid instead of the main grease.

**Stipend:** $150 USD per month for 3-month internship program

**Path to Conversion:** High-performers have potential path to junior engineer role



# About ANONYMA AI:

Anonyma is a marketing tech startup helping brands scale their organic social media presence. We manage high-volume content operations across multiple platforms, working with e-commerce and B2B clients to maximize their reach without paid ads.

*Funded by SF-backed exit founders. Building systems that help brands grow from 10 to 100+ social accounts.*

# What This Internship Is:

A real shot at becoming a founding engineer at a funded startup. No coffee runs or laid back work. You'll ship actual features that real customers use.

If you prove yourself in 3 months, you have a path to convert to a junior engineer with competitive pay + equity.

# What You'll Actually Do:

Work directly embedded with Sam (CTO, ex-Zoom/ex-Fella Health YC W20) who will mentor you through:

* **Weeks 1-2:** Learn the codebase. Fix bugs. Ship small features. Daily pair programming sessions.
* **Weeks 5-8:** Own a feature end-to-end. Could be part of the carousel editor, posting queue system, or client dashboard.
* **Weeks 9-12:** Build something from scratch. API integration, new tool, internal automation—something you can point to and say ""I built that.""

You'll get real startup experience: fast feedback loops, direct access to founders, seeing your code go to production within days not months.

# Our Stack:

**Frontend:**

* React 18 with TypeScript
* Vite (build tool & dev server)
* TanStack Query (data fetching)
* Wouter (routing)
* Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
* React Hook Form + Zod (forms & validation)

**Backend:**

* Express.js with TypeScript
* Drizzle ORM (database access)

**Database:**

* PostgreSQL via Neon (serverless)

Don't know all of this? That's fine. You should know at least one part of the stack (React OR Node) and be willing to learn fast.



# You're a fit if you:

* Have built *something* with code (school project, personal site, bootcamp portfolio—doesn't matter)
* Can show us code you've written (GitHub, replit, whatever)
* Are comfortable with either JavaScript/TypeScript or have strong fundamentals in another language
* Want to learn by doing, not by watching tutorials
* Get excited about building things that scale



# You shouldn't apply if:

* You need a structured curriculum—we're a startup, you'll define your own learning path
* You can't handle ambiguity or figuring things out



# The Internship Structure:

**Week 1:**

* Onboarding with Sam
* Set up dev environment
* Ship your first bug fix
* Pair programming daily

**Weeks 2-4:**

* Pick up small features
* Code reviews with Sam
* Learn testing, deployment, code quality
* Start understanding product decisions

**Weeks 5-8:**

* Own a feature end-to-end
* Present your work to the team
* Start contributing to technical decisions
* Get exposure to customer feedback

**Weeks 9-12:**

* Build a standalone project/module
* Final presentation to founders
* Conversion decision discussion
* Portfolio piece completion

**Throughout:**

* Weekly 1:1s with Sam
* Access to founder office hours
* Real startup environment exposure
* Learn how code connects to business outcomes



# Our Cultural Standards:

As our first intern, you'll help shape this culture:

* **If we're average we fail** – We only ship ""insanely great."" Excellence isn't optional.
* **Commitment to candor** – Full transparency both ways. We say things directly, with love.
* **Maniacal sense of urgency** – We execute at a pace most think is impossible. Speed wins.
* **Bulldozing barriers** – The world is malleable. We're relentlessly resourceful.
* **Keep your head down** – Boring people doing exciting work.
* **The power of focus** – Know your One Thing. Nail it.



# Internship Benefits:

* **Stipend:** $150 per month for 3 months
* **Mentorship:** Mentorship by founders who've scaled YC co's to $80M ARR
* **Real Experience:** Ship code to production, not fake projects
* **Remote:** WFH
* **Conversion Path:** Clear path for full-time offer
* **Portfolio:** Build something you can show future employers



# Selection Process:

This is competitive. We'll take 1-2 interns max for this cohort.

It can feel like anxiety and then you realize it's not anxiety, but that you are opening to more light. It can feel like severe exhaustion, burn out, that you've used up all your life force energy and you have used up the reserve bank of life force energy and that you're at the very end of that and about to collapse. You may cry, moan, groan, pant, and quite loudly, where people ask you if you're ok, or what's going on with you and you don't have an answer.

Now the Angels are not just opening the channel a smidgen, or a little bit more, or bending it open, or wrangling it open, or even forcing it open quite hugely. Rather, it is exploding the damm open and there's not going to be any hold backs, none whatsoever.

The light that will come through the lightworker individual and collective right now is beyond nuclear, laser and all of that. It will cause some very interesting catapulting changes around the world, in the human society, possibly also in the natural world. It's all an alignment with the plan of the Divine Mother, the Big Picture, the transformation before the 1,000 years of bliss, before the New Earth can manifest without any disturbance, hindrances or interference particles being in the way of absolute light and bliss.

We are as a lightworker collective again purging human collective suffering; negative energies from from the planetary grids and earth plane 3D restrictiveness, contraction and pure suffering. It's not the first time we've done this and it won't be the last. It can very easily be registered as our own pain and suffering, or at least taking it on from friends and family. Only 1 - 2 % of this would be our own past or past life, weaving in with the collective planetary and human collective suffering, which goes back millennia. It's going to be very easy to feel this as belonging to the individual and wondering where it is coming from now.

The Angels tell me that now there's a bit of a race against time. We have to purge, purify and clear the human collective in 3D Earth plane as much as possible, in order for certain events to not happen and other higher frequency events to instead take place, in the 3D experience. Much is pushing up from the ground and from the underground, various spirit activity and shadow realm programming. If the lightworkers were not here receiving it, taking it on and transmuting it, the panet would burn more rapidly, perhaps even instantaneously.

As we receive this planetary purge and transmute it, which you know sometimes is indirectly through the Earth grids and sometimes burning dross through our own energy fields more directly, it's going to feel uncomfortable, like an acidic something. We are also to remember that in the midst of that, you can see that this is an opening of your channel to the light dimensions of you, the individual as a channel to more light, more freedom and more of the Divine to be able to move into the 3D dimensional reality.

This will be different moment to moment. It can feel very difficult to be in the body. It can feel very difficult to eat food, to nurture oneself and even to receive nurturing from others. It's going to be a moment to moment; keeping oneself in balance, grounded, feet down - head up and clear awareness of that this is not my stuff. So the shadow dimension across the globe is breaking up in a particular layer, and we will feel that as jitterjiness, acidic, breaking, crushing glass. It's going to feel just very close to it being too much.

I'm being told to reach for the plant kingdom for assistance. Valerian, ashwaganda, lemon balm, reishi, schizandra, black tea and coffee. Everything and everybody is helping us. Angels, Ascended Masters, plants, animals, devic kingdom, deities and God. All we have to do is be here and breathe through it.

So I'm having for dinner: cherry pie, skittles and strong black tea. Some smoked Gouda cheese and pineapple pieces. A grazing tray, because I can only nibble.

☆

So this is not us perging our emotions. It can feel as if it is but it is not. It looks like this is going to come and go in waves for several months. And every time we level out, you may experience yourself slightly elevated, just a slight raising.

If you haven't read either of these books, that were going around in the '90s; E.T. 101, Nothing in this book is true but it's exactly the way things are, Bringers of the dawn, Celestial prophecies and anything by Solara, those are incredible go to road maps.

1qpgxto,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qpgxto/the_psychology_of_reading_people_6_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Reading People: 6 Science-Based Tricks That Actually Work,"You ever meet someone and just *know* something's off? Or maybe you can't tell if your date's
actually into you or just being polite? Yeah, me too. After diving deep into behavioral psychology
(books, research papers, FBI interrogation tactics, you name it), I realized most of us are
walking around completely blind to the obvious signals people throw at us every single day.
Here's the thing: reading people isn't some mystical superpower. It's pattern recognition. And
once you know what to look for, you can't unsee it. These tricks come from legit sources like Joe
Navarro (ex-FBI guy who literally wrote the book on body language), psychology research, and
yeah, some hard lessons from my own social fuckups.
Let's get into it.
## 1. Watch Their Feet, Not Their Face
Everyone focuses on facial expressions because we think that's where the truth lives. Wrong.
People control their faces way more than you think. They smile when they're uncomfortable, nod
when they disagree, maintain eye contact when they're lying their ass off.
But feet? Feet don't lie.
If someone's feet are pointed toward you during conversation, they're engaged and interested. If
their feet are angled toward the door or away from you, their brain is already somewhere else.
They might be smiling and nodding, but their body is screaming ""get me out of here.""
This comes straight from What Every Body is Saying by Joe Navarro, an ex-FBI
counterintelligence officer who spent 25 years reading criminals and spies. This book is
INSANE. It breaks down every micro-gesture humans make when they're lying, stressed, or
hiding something. If you want to level up your people-reading game, this is non-negotiable. Best
body language book that exists, period.
## 2. Look for Pacifying Behaviors Under Stress
When people feel threatened or uncomfortable, they do weird little things to calm themselves
down. Touching their neck, rubbing their lips, playing with their hair, adjusting their collar. These
are called pacifying behaviors, and they're your cheat code to knowing when someone's anxious
or lying.
In high-stress conversations (job interviews, confrontations, first dates), watch for these
movements. If someone suddenly starts touching their face or neck right after you ask a
question, that question made them uncomfortable. Their limbic system (the lizard brain) took
over and tried to self-soothe.
You can practice this anywhere. Watch people in uncomfortable situations: waiting rooms,
awkward Zoom calls, tense family dinners. Once you start seeing it, you'll notice it everywhere.
## 3. Read Baseline Behavior First
This one's crucial and most people skip it. You can't know if someone's acting weird unless you
know how they act normally. That's their baseline.
Spend the first 10-15 minutes of any interaction just observing. How much do they gesture? Do
they make eye contact? Are they naturally fidgety or calm? Once you've got their baseline,
*then* you can spot deviations.
If someone who's usually chill suddenly gets fidgety when a specific topic comes up, that's your
signal. If someone who never touches their face starts rubbing their nose, pay attention. The
change matters more than the behavior itself.
This technique is used by professional interrogators and profilers. They don't just jump in with
hard questions. They establish normal first, then watch for cracks.
## 4. Mirror to Build Trust, Then Break to Test
Mirroring is when you subtly copy someone's body language, tone, or speech patterns. It's one
of the fastest ways to build rapport because it signals ""we're alike, you're safe with me."" People
do it naturally when they vibe with someone.
But here's the advanced move: once you've built that connection through mirroring, *stop
mirroring and see if they follow you*. If they start copying your movements or posture, congrats,
you've got influence. They're subconsciously trying to maintain that connection. If they don't
follow, the rapport isn't as strong as you thought.
Try this at a coffee shop or bar. Match their energy level, posture, drink pace. After 10 minutes,
shift your posture completely and see what happens. It's like a social experiment you can run in
real time.
## 5. Listen to What They Don't Say
People reveal more through omission than admission. When someone tells you a story and
skips over a detail that should obviously be there, that's where the truth is hiding.
""How was your weekend?"" ""Oh, great! Went hiking, grabbed dinner, chilled at home."" Notice
what's missing? Who they were with. If someone avoids mentioning people in their stories,
there's usually a reason.
Same with job interviews. If someone talks about their last job but never mentions their boss or
team, red flag. If they describe a project but avoid explaining their specific role, they probably
didn't do much.
This trick comes from investigative journalism and therapy techniques. Trained listeners don't
just hear what's said, they map what's conspicuously absent. Start doing this and conversations
become way more revealing.
## 6. Watch for Microexpressions (The 0.5 Second Truth)
Microexpressions are involuntary facial flashes that last less than half a second. They're your
true emotional reaction before your brain catches up and puts on the ""appropriate"" face. Most
people miss them entirely because they're so fast.
The most common ones: disgust (nose wrinkle), contempt (one-sided mouth raise), fear (raised
eyebrows, widened eyes), and anger (lowered brows, tight lips).
Someone might say ""I'm totally fine with that"" while flashing contempt for a split second. That
microexpression is the truth. The words are the cover-up.
Paul Ekman spent his entire career researching this stuff, and his work was the basis for the
show *Lie to Me*. If you want to train yourself, there are apps and online tools where you can
practice spotting microexpressions. It's like a gym workout for your observation skills.
The more you practice, the more you'll catch these tiny truth bombs in real conversations.
Meetings, arguments, dates, all of it becomes way more transparent.
---
Real talk: None of this makes you a mind reader. People are complex and context matters. But
these tricks give you an edge. You'll spot lies faster, build rapport easier, and stop wasting time
on people who aren't genuine.
If you're serious about going deeper into behavioral psychology and people-reading skills,
there's this AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from exactly these kinds of sources, books
like Navarro's work, Ekman's research on microexpressions, FBI interrogation techniques, and
tons of psychology studies. You type in what you want to learn (like ""master reading body
language in social situations"" or ""become better at detecting deception""), and it generates
personalized audio content with adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals. You can
customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives
with examples and case studies. Plus you get a virtual coach that you can ask questions to
anytime. Built by AI experts from Columbia and Google, so the content is genuinely
research-backed and not just surface-level fluff.
The goal isn't to become some manipulative asshole. It's to protect your energy and invest it in
people who are actually worth it. Once you start seeing beneath the surface, everything

Our theater, which fits 800 people, was FULL. We are located in a pretty economically depressed and densely populated area of the state so I wasn’t exactly surprised. 

Crowd arrived at 7am. It was genuinely sad listening to our front of house staff confiscate coffee cup after coffee cup from the bleary eyed, business casual clad masses. 

The event proper started at 8am and it was comical how over the top and high energy the speakers were. They could not read the room at all. It was the crack of dawn and everyone was sleepy. All they really talked about is the certification process and stuff like that. Plus a lot of teary sob stories about families in poverty lifted from their sorry state by the grace of Primerica. They sadly launched like 3 T-shirts into the crowd of 800 people. 

What I mostly remember is how LONG the presentations were. The first session was 4 hours long, then an hour lunch break (lunch not provided), then four more hours of presentation. In the live event industry, expecting people to sit for more than two hours is a no-no, but we all realized the grueling length of the event was purposeful so we let it slide. 

The only presentation that truly stuck out to me was toward the end of the first session when one woman who was extremely high up in Primerica took the stage. (Maybe she was the founder, I actually don’t remember, but she was very high up the chain). Her presentation? A detailed virtual tour of her multi million dollar home. I’m not exaggerating. She showed us room to room all the features of her luxurious house. Three years later this house is still burned into my brain because she talked about it for at least 45 minutes. Anyway, she ended the session with announcing the lunch break. Except, she made a huge point about how she doesn’t even eat lunch and she works straight through her lunch breaks and encourages everyone to do the same. I’m not kidding when I say I saw her in the green room 20 minutes later devouring a subway foot long. 

I will say though, after the event was all said and done, the Primerica people running the event were incredibly kind to us. One guy slipped all the stagehands $100 bills as a tip even though we didn’t work for tips.

Between making the legal minimum hourly wage and the unexpected tip, I can safely say I made more money off Primerica than anyone sitting through those presentations. God bless their souls. ",97,1769619409.0,antiMLM,11,0.99,False

One my wife and I have been together for 25 years… wow just typing that out feels heavy. She is chronically ill with many autoimmune issues, including Ehlers danlos syndrome, Reynard syndrome, a spina bifida Oculta, anemia, chronic fatigue syndrome. IBS. We have four kids that are living with us 23 15, 13 and eight. All of them have some form of special needs the older three are high functioning and with Reminders and guidance they can function on their own. Our youngest is nonverbal autistic level three.

 I am a father of four for the last 16 years I have been the sole breadwinner. For at least the last 5 I have done 90 percent of the cooking and cleaning. When I ask for help I am asking too much. If I ask my wife not to sleep till noon and have breakfast or a coffee together I am asking too much.

1qpglcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theeWildOlive/comments/1qpglcg/the_perfect_cup_of_coffee/,The perfect cup of coffee,"**Prompt of the Day:**  What’s something that could be done in a simple or easy way, but you insist on doing it the hard way?

My answer to this question would have to be “making coffee”.  Coffee is one of those things that can be as simple as adding hot water to instant crystals, or as complicated as roasting your own beans.  Now, I don’t go that far, mainly because have you smelled that?  I don’t know how anything as delicious-smelling as roasted coffee beans could start out smelling soooo bad.  

I’m not sure when I slid into being a coffee snob, but I think it started during the flavored coffee/Starbucks craze of the 90’s.  I was responsible for buying the coffee for our facility.  My manager didn’t care how much $$$ I spent on it, and I welcomed any excuse to get the hell out of there for an hour or so (I had a “good” job, it was just boring), so I ended up sourcing our coffee from a local coffee shop.  Well, that kicked off a coffee obsession in my office.  We worked our way through pretty much everything they offered and enjoyed “reviewing” my latest purchases.  I learned to tinker with our huge coffee maker to get the best brew, and I taught the other coffee drinkers how to make it properly.  We were living large.

I think that experience taught me that small tweaks can make a huge difference in how delicious your coffee comes out, and also that no matter what you do, you can’t get good coffee from bad beans.  And unfortunately, once you’ve had “good” coffee, you can’t go back.  In fact, whenever I go on vacation, by the end, there are two things I’m dying to get back to – my own comfortable bed and a decent cup of coffee. 

So how do I get that “decent” cup of coffee?  First, I buy good beans.  I’m not thaaaaat snobby about beans.  I don’t care how highly rated something is; if I don’t like the flavor profile, I don’t like it.  I know light roast beans are de rigueur, but I cannot stand that weird, fruity taste they always have.  After sampling through dozens and dozens of single-origin and custom blends, I’m firmly a medium roast girl.  At some point, I got the brilliant idea to keep track of all the coffees I’ve tried.  I keep a list in my Notes app of every coffee we buy, with a comment on whether we liked it and why.  Frustratingly, often when we find a coffee we love, we never see it again.  But tracking what we like and why helps us choose something new.  It showed us that we prefer medium roast, we never like coffees that claim “chocolatey,” “cherry,” or “roasted nut” flavors, and we prefer coffees from Ethiopia and Costa Rica.

Second, I buy my coffee whole bean and grind it myself every time I make a cup.  Yes, it really does matter.  The flavor compounds in coffee are highly volatile (and extremely temperature sensitive, more on that later).  The minute you grind coffee beans, the clock is ticking.  The longer coffee sits, the more it loses those complex notes that take your cup from “yeah, that’s coffee” to “oh my goodness, that is sublime.”  My first foray into grinding my own beans was what was widely available at the time – ye olde blade grinder.  So loud.  So messy.  So imprecise. 

Thank the Maker I discovered the Capresso burr grinder.  That is a great little gadget for grinding beans for any brewing method, from an espresso maker to a French press.  Granted, it’s also a little messy.  But here’s a tip to minimize that static energy buildup that causes a few of the grounds to fly onto the counter.  After your beans are ground, give the side of the machine a few pats to settle the grounds in the cup, then WAIT.  Just wait 60 seconds or so, and slowly pull out the cup.  Voila, no fly-away coffee grounds.

 Third, buying whole beans is definitely a step up from pre-ground, but how I store them matters, too.  Whole bean coffee usually comes vacuum-sealed.  If I’m buying it from a local roaster in bags that aren’t vacuum sealed, I don’t buy that much at any one time.  Just because it’s whole bean doesn’t mean it will last forever, especially unsealed.  We pour a week’s worth of beans into the hopper of our grinder, and then vacuum seal the rest in a glass canning jar.  The Foodsaver is an appliance we use almost every day, and it’s great for sealing all kinds of things in canning jars.  I’ve read so many studies on whether you should put beans in the fridge, freezer, or store them in a cupboard.  I believe the fridge and freezer are out, because every time you open the jar or bag, condensation settles on the beans, and that environment can be harsh for certain flavor compounds.  I think the best solution is to buy small amounts and store them airtight or vacuum-sealed in a cool, dark cupboard.

 Finally, along with sampling through a ton of beans, I’ve also tried pretty much every method there is to make coffee:  numerous automatic drip machines (my favorite is an old 10-cup insulated carafe Capresso that was manufactured in Korea), French presses, automatic espresso machines, Bialetti stovetop espresso makers, a ROK espresso maker, an AeroPress, a Chemex, and finally a ceramic thingy that lets you make a single cup of pourover coffee (our current favorite method).  I’ve learned from all this experimenting that more than anything, the water temperature is what’s mission-critical.  Regardless of method, the best coffee is made using water at the right temperature (around 200°F).  Most automatic drip machines don’t get anywhere near that, as they prioritize speed over precision.  If you prefer the convenience of an automatic drip, look for a model that explicitly states it brews within that temperature range, or you'll get under-extracted, flat-tasting coffee.

My husband was skeptical of my insistence on the water temperature until we did some experiments.  We have a small 5-cup Capresso that makes *decent* coffee, even though it never gets the water quite hot enough (yes, I’ve temped it as it brews).  I did a head-to-head comparison using the same amounts of coffee and water between that machine and the Chemex, a pour-over vessel.  The Chemex consistently makes better coffee because you control the water temp.  No matter which beans we use, the Chemex brews the best coffee.  Is it a pain in the ass to stand there slowly pouring hot water over the coffee grounds?  Kinda.  Is it annoying that the coffee gets cold quickly because it’s just sitting in a glass beaker?  Yeah.  Altho if you preheat the carafe with hot water and set it on a fabric trivet instead of ice-cold stone counters, it holds a little better.  Is that damn thing hard to clean?  Yes.  Is it worth it to me?  YES.

Now, I will say that since hubs and I rise an hour or two apart, I bought him a single-cup pour-over gadget because I don’t care for reheated coffee.  I can’t figure out why, but making 2 (albeit large) cups in the Chemex tastes better than brewing 1 cup with the ceramic thing.  Same beans, same water temp, same pour over rate.  I’m not sure what witchcraft is going on in the Chemex, but it’s something.  I think it lets the water drip through the filter a bit more slowly.

 

So there you have it —making coffee is something I prefer to do “the hard way”.  I realize coffee is an extremely personal thing.  Some people don’t really care about the flavor – they just want that caffeine.  Some people absolutely appreciate the flavor of a “properly” made cup, but not to the point of grinding their own beans or standing there making a pour-over.  But for some of us, coffee is almost a self-care ritual.  That one exquisitely delicious cup of coffee is something I look forward to each morning.  It starts my day with an energy of I matter, my preferences matter, my simple pleasures matter.  If you fancy an amazing cuppa, I’d highly recommend the Chemex.  You’ll be amazed at how much more flavorful your coffee is when brewed this way.  Oh, and you will need a digital kettle.  The Oxo gooseneck digital kettle has been a champ.  Cheers.",1,1769618761.0,u_theeWildOlive,0,1.0,False

1qpgl1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qpgl1g/the_psychology_of_male_loneliness_why_your_social/,The Psychology of Male Loneliness: Why Your Social Circle is SHRINKING (and What Actually Works to Fix It),"

I've been researching this topic for months after noticing something weird. Three of my close friends mentioned feeling isolated within the same week. Not sad or depressed exactly, just disconnected. Then I started seeing the data everywhere. Male loneliness has literally tripled in the last 30 years. 15% of men now report having zero close friends. ZERO. And men under 30 are the loneliest demographic in modern history.

This isn't just a personal failing. Society shifted massively. We don't have third places anymore (RIP neighborhood bars that weren't just for getting wasted). Work from home killed water cooler friendships. Dating apps replaced organic social mixing. Men's social skills atrophied because we stopped practicing them. Plus there's this biological factor where women naturally maintain broader social networks while men historically bonded through shared activities, which modern life eliminated.

But here's the thing. This pattern can absolutely be interrupted and reversed with the right approach.

**1. Join activity based groups, not networking events**

Forced socialization feels awful. Shared purpose feels natural. The research is clear on this. Dr. Robin Dunbar (Oxford evolutionary psychologist who literally discovered the limit of human social capacity) found that men specifically bond better while doing things side by side rather than face to face conversation.

Join a climbing gym. A DnD group. A basketball league. Volunteer at an animal shelter. The activity gives you something to focus on when conversation lulls, and friendships develop organically over weeks without that  are we friends now?  awkwardness.

I started going to a weekly board game meetup six months ago. Felt stupid at first. Now I genuinely look forward to Tuesday nights more than weekend plans.

**2. Initiate more than feels comfortable**

Most men wait to be invited. That's the problem. Everyone's waiting. Someone has to break the cycle.

Text first. Suggest specific plans, not  we should hang sometime.  Literally say  Want to grab coffee Saturday at 10am?  The specificity matters. Vague suggestions die in text threads.

This feels vulnerable as hell initially. You'll worry about seeming desperate or annoying. But according to research from Dr. Marisa Franco (friendship researcher, wrote  Platonic ), people consistently underestimate how much others want to hear from them. That study where they had people reach out to old friends? Recipients were WAY happier about the contact than initiators predicted.

The app Ash actually has a decent feature for this. It's primarily a mental health and relationship coaching app, but they have conversation starters and framework for reaching out without it feeling forced. Helped me get over that initial  is this weird  hump.

**3. Show up consistently to the same places**

Regularity creates familiarity. Familiarity creates comfort. Comfort creates friendship.

Go to the same coffee shop. Same gym time. Same bar trivia night. You'll start recognizing faces. Eventually someone will nod. Then someone will comment on your book or band shirt. Then you're chatting for five minutes. Then you're friends.

This is how humans socialized for millennia before we all became digital hermits. Repeated unplanned interaction in shared spaces. We need to recreate that intentionally now.

**4. Learn to be okay with surface level first**

Deep meaningful connection doesn't happen immediately, and expecting it creates pressure that kills potential friendships before they start.

Start with weather chat. Sports. That new taco place. Work stuff. Random observations. You're building comfort and trust slowly. The deep stuff comes later naturally once you've logged enough hours together.

Guys especially struggle with this because we've been sold this myth that real friendship means bearing your soul immediately. Nah. Real friendship means showing up repeatedly and gradually letting people in.

**5. Get serious about fixing your social skills**

If you're lonely, there's a decent chance your social calibration is off. Not your fault. Skill atrophy is real when you don't practice.

The book  How to Win Friends and Influence People  by Dale Carnegie is still insanely relevant 87 years later. Yes it's old. Yes some examples are dated. But the core principles about making people feel heard and valued are timeless. Carnegie was literally the first self improvement author and this sold 30 million copies for good reason. This book will make you question everything you think you know about conversation.

For something more modern, check out Charisma on Command's YouTube channel. Charlie breaks down social dynamics from movie scenes and interviews in a way that actually makes sense. The  How to Never Run Out of Things to Say  video specifically is gold for guys who freeze up in conversation.

If you want something more structured that connects the dots between all these books and expert insights, there's this app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it turns books like Carnegie's, research on male friendship patterns, and talks from social psychology experts into personalized audio lessons. You can tell it your specific goal, like  build a social circle as an introverted guy,  and it creates a learning plan pulling from the best sources on friendship formation, conversation skills, and social anxiety.

The depth customization is clutch. Sometimes you want a quick 15-minute refresher on conversation principles before a social event. Other times you're in the mood for a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and context. The voice options make a difference too, especially the more conversational styles that don't feel like you're being lectured at.

**6. Pursue interesting solo hobbies that naturally involve community**

Photography. Craft beer brewing. Woodworking. Bouldering. Cycling. Cooking classes. These hobbies have built in communities where people actually talk to each other.

Reddit has active subreddits for basically every interest. Local Facebook groups (I know, but they're actually useful for this) organize meetups. Meetup dot com is specifically designed for this.

The hobby gives you identity and conversation material beyond  so what do you do for work?  You become the photography guy or the sourdough guy. People remember you. They associate you with something interesting.

**7. Fix your digital habits**

Social media makes loneliness worse. Full stop. The research from Dr. Jean Twenge (psychology professor, wrote  iGen ) is devastating. Every study shows the same pattern. More screen time equals more loneliness, more depression, more anxiety.

But here's the counterintuitive part. It's not about deleting everything. It's about using it as a tool to facilitate real connection rather than a replacement for it.

Use social media to make plans, not to feel connected. Text to coordinate hangouts, not to maintain friendships entirely through memes. The digital should serve the physical, not replace it.

Insight Timer (meditation app) has great guided meditations specifically about digital detox and being present. The  Connecting with Others Authentically  series helped me realize how checked out I was during actual conversations because my brain was still in scroll mode.

**8. Accept that building a social circle takes months, not weeks**

You're basically starting from scratch. That's fine. It took years to lose your friends through drift and life changes. It'll take months to build new ones.

Most people give up after a few weeks when the loneliness doesn't immediately vanish. That's the critical mistake. Friendship formation follows a predictable timeline. Research shows it takes roughly 50 hours of interaction to move from acquaintance to casual friend, 90 hours to become real friends, and 200+ hours to become close friends.

Track your social interactions for a month. Not obsessively, just generally. You'll probably realize you're not putting in nearly enough volume. Treat it like going to the gym. Consistency over intensity.

You're not broken. The infrastructure for male friendship just collapsed and nobody really noticed or cared because men aren't supposed to need emotional support. But you do need it. We all do. And the only way forward is deliberate, consistent effort to rebuild what used to happen naturally.

2.⁠ ⁠You’re paying for sleep you don’t get. Hiring another junior to “cover the night shift” costs you a salary, benefits, and a mountain of onboarding. An AI agent works 24/7 for a fraction of that price.  

3.⁠ ⁠Data is the new oil, but you’re still using a bucket. AI can sift through emails, pull out the gold, and even draft replies that sound human. You’re still manually copy‑pasting? That’s a productivity crime.  

What I’m doing (and you should too):  

•⁠  ⁠Deploy a dedicated AI assistant for inbox triage, calendar scheduling, and basic customer support. It learns your tone, your product, and never asks for a coffee break.  

•⁠  ⁠Hook it up to your CRM/WhatsApp/website so leads get instant follow‑ups the second they show interest. No more “we’ll get back to you in 48 h.”  

•⁠  ⁠Free up the human brain for strategy, creativity, and the stuff that actually moves the needle.  



Result: Teams that have integrated a 24/7 AI “digital employee” see response times slash by 60‑70 % and revenue lift by double‑digit percentages in the first month.  



Why you’re still on the fence:  

Because you’re scared of the unknown, or you think AI is a “nice‑to‑have” gimmick. Spoiler: it’s a must‑have if you want to stay competitive in 2024‑25.



TL;DR: Stop treating AI like a futuristic toy. Treat it like the cheap, tireless intern you’ve always needed.

1qpgfz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1qpgfz2/the_cowboy_and_the_witch/,The Cowboy and The Witch,"The cowboy never meant to survive that year.

It started with his brother leaving. Not storming out, not slamming doors just walking away and saying the kind of things that stay lodged in the body long after the sound fades. The brother had been more than a sibling. He’d been a stand-in father, a fixed star. When he left, something essential went with him. The cowboy didn’t talk about it much. He just learned how to carry the weight quietly.

On the same day everything fell apart, the cowboy sent a video by accident. A dumb clip an Invincible edit, Omni-Man with bees, absurd and loud and meaningless. Or at least it should have been. It was meant for no one in particular. Certainly not for Circe.

But Circe replied.

That should have been the end of it. A brief exchange, a laugh, nothing more. Instead, it became something steady. Conversations about comic books and stupid jokes and nothing at all. About everything, sometimes. About survival, without ever naming it. The cowboy hadn’t realized how close he was to disappearing until Circe gave him a reason to stay present.

They talked every day. Not dramatically. Just consistently. For over two hundred days, there was at least one message, one tether back to the world. While grief and anger churned underneath everything else, Circe became constant. Not a savior in the grand, cinematic sense but the kind that keeps someone breathing without realizing that’s what they’re doing.

The cowboy hated being called a hero after that. He wasn’t one. Heroes save people. Heroes pull others back from ledges. The cowboy had just been trying not to fall.

Circe never knew the full weight of it. She talked. She listened. She understood jokes no one else ever seemed to get. That was enough. That was everything.

Somewhere along the way quietly, unwillingly the cowboy fell in love with her. Not the way stories usually describe it. There was no first sight, no hands brushing, no shared space at all. He didn’t even know what she looked like. The feeling crept in slowly, disguised as gratitude, admiration, relief. When he noticed it, it already felt shameful. Unfair. Circe hadn’t asked to be someone’s anchor.

Later, change came. An internship. A new city. A chance to move, to breathe somewhere else. The cowboy took it because he needed distance from the wreckage his brother had left behind. The fact that it was Circe’s city was coincidence. At least, that’s what he told himself.

He debated whether to say anything. Silence felt kinder. But honesty won out, eventually. When he told her, something shifted. Not immediately. Just enough to notice. The replies slowed. The interest thinned. The streak once effortless started to feel like obligation.

Circe mentioned a coffee bar once. Said she wanted to try it someday. The cowboy invited her. She said maybe. Then didn’t show. Later, she said she was busy. And that was when he understood.

It wasn’t rejection that hurt most. It was the fear that wanting anything at all had damaged something fragile and rare. That by existing too loudly, he had pushed away the person who had kept him alive when he didn’t know if he wanted to be.

The cowboy never blamed Circe. He never could. She was just a person. A normal one. She didn’t owe him love, or presence, or responsibility for his survival.

That was why he never told her the truth.

He carried it quietly instead: that he believed he wouldn’t be here without her, and that knowing that made him careful to the point of silence. Writing it down was the only way to honor what she had been to him without placing the weight of it in her hands.

Some heroes never know the lives they save.

And some cowboys live on because of it.",2,1769618446.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

Should we actively notice the people around us, or rely on small, incidental acts of care to make connections?","I stopped by my regular coffee shop this morning for the first time in a couple of weeks. I’d been sick and mostly staying home, so it felt nice just to get out again. When I got to the counter, the cashier looked up and said, “Hey! Haven’t seen you in a while, is everything okay?”

It caught me completely off guard. I hadn’t realized they noticed me beyond my usual order. It was such a small thing, but it made me reflect on how much we rely on tiny social interactions to feel connected. Even brief encounters, like a barista greeting a regular, a mail carrier noticing a change in routine, or a neighbor saying hello, can quietly shape our sense of belonging.

That got me thinking. How can we best support these moments of connection in our daily lives?

A. Actively notice the people around you. Take a moment to ask colleagues, neighbors, or service staff how they’re doing, or simply acknowledge their presence. By being intentional about noticing others, you can strengthen relationships and make small connections meaningful.

B. Appreciate and respond to incidental acts of care. Sometimes noticing and caring for others happens naturally without deliberate effort. By being open to these moments, ,acknowledging them, reciprocating kindness, or simply feeling seen, you can still cultivate a sense of connection and belonging in everyday life.

i crossed **1.5K$ arr** with [this SaaS](https://www.aileads.now/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=how-i-hit-1.5kaar-automating-community-marketing)

for context im building this ai saas to automates marketing in niche spots like reddit (and soon linkedin and facebook groups).

\- no VC funding.

\- no co founder.

\- no fancy launch party.

its just me grinding through late nights fueled by way too much coffee and that slow build up you cant rush.

early on i figured business growth would explode if i just cranked out features quicker or hustled harder on outreach. i couldn't be more wrong.

what actually worked was leaving the idea of growth as some big lucky break and building it into a steady system instead. since im technical i leaned hard into automation right away particularly for content and posting.

i set up automated sequences to find relevant communities, give me post ideas based on my other saas products and schedule them without me touching a thing. first month i found zero traction, zero leads and barely any engagement. second month still quiet but a few replies came in. then organic interactions picked up after new years holidays and qualified leads started converting to signups daily. my SaaS basically went from 0 to 1.5KARR in 15 days. i still can't believe it.

heres the key steps that made this work for my marketing setup:

\- pick your niches tight target communities where your audience hangs out or linkedin groups for b2b growth hackers. use tools to scan for active ones with 5k plus members.

\- automate content creation feed in your brand voice and let ai help you with ideas and corrections. avoid anything salesy at first focus on value.

\- schedule consistently post 3 to 5 times a week across platforms track what gets replies and double down on those formats.

\- monitor for leads integrate simple tracking to capture emails from dms or comments turn those chats into demo requests without manual follow up.

\- optimize for ai search tweak content with keywords that show up in chatGPT Claude responses so your brand pops in ai driven queries.

setting your automation systems cut the daily manual grind hour. tbh it drives me nuts how many founders still grind cold emails when communities convert better. i stil did not try ads yet.

i love seeing those notifications for new signups roll in, this is the best feeling. unreal.

anyway thats how i pieced together this growth. this is just the beginning obviously but very promising imo.

happy to chat more if you're in a similar spot.

cheers.

1qpg863,https://www.reddit.com/r/BookRecommendations/comments/1qpg863/i_read_the_last_wolf_by_laszlo_krasznahorkai_dont/,I read The Last Wolf by Laszlo Krasznahorkai. Don't know if the single-sentence structure added anything to an otherwise awesome book.,"Hello! I'm back with my next one. I know I was to share a review of *Origin* by Dan Brown first. But it's such a tome, and finishing it has been such a task, that I decided to pick up something light in the meantime. This novella, however, is only light in size.

Laszlo Krasznohorkai is a writer who deals in the weight of the world: the slow, inevitable fading of nature and the heavy silence that follows. In this novella, featuring *The Last Wolf* and *Herman*, we are given two very different windows into this darkness. While the book is undeniably powerful, it is also a frustrating experience of two halves. It wasn't clear to me though as to why these two stories were put together, besides a loose overarching theme of beasts and humanity.

# The Burden of Style

The first story, *The Last Wolf*, is written entirely as one single, winding sentence. It follows a washed-up philosopher in a Berlin bar who recounts his trip to the Spanish region of Extremadura to find the last wolf. While this ""marathon"" style is Krasznohorkai’s trademark and granted, this is my introduction to his works, it felt a bit like a gimmick to me in this book at least. The constant stream of clauses makes you focus more on the mechanics of the writing than the tragedy of the story. You find yourself watching the prose rather than feeling the extinction it describes.

When the narrator notes that he ""...didn’t want to look at anything anymore, he didn’t want to see anything, because everything he saw was a joke,"" the technical difficulty of the long sentence actually blunts the sharp edge of his despair. It’s an exhausting choice that begs the question: does this structure add anything, or is it just a barrier?

# The Raw Impact of Herman

In stark contrast, the second part of the book, *Herman*, is a complete gutpunch. Herman is an expert trapper hired to clear a forest of ""harmful"" predators. Unlike the first story, this narrative is sharp and direct. When Herman’s moral compass finally breaks and he begins to see the humans as the true predators, the impact is visceral. It lacks the self-conscious density of the first half, opting instead for a cold, piercing tragedy. One wonders why the first part couldn’t have shared this devastating clarity, the story of the trapper feels much more grounded and haunting because it doesn't hide behind a stylistic trick.

# A World Fading to Black

Philosophically, the book explores the deep rift between humanity and the natural world. Krasznohorkai presents a bleak view: once we destroy the wild ""holy"" elements of our world, like the wolf, human consciousness becomes a lonely, meaningless mistake. It is a meditation on the fact that we cannot return to nature once we have corrupted it.

Despite my issues with the one-sentence structure, this book is itself pretty great. Krasznohorkai’s ability to describe desolation is pretty intense.

I finished the final page feeling deeply unsettled, and I am desperate to read more of his haunting work. Richard Yates' description of the moribund and the desolate comes close to what I read here in this extremely short representation.

1qpg6ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qpg6ip/how_to_make_people_respect_you_without_saying_a/,How to Make People Respect You WITHOUT Saying a Word: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Look, I've spent years studying this shit. Books, podcasts, research papers, the whole nine yards. And here's what nobody tells you: Most people think respect comes from what you say, how loud you speak, or how much you talk. Wrong. Dead wrong.

The real power players? They command respect through pure presence. No words needed. I've watched it happen in boardrooms, social settings, even at the gym. Some people walk in and the energy shifts. Everyone notices. And it's not magic, it's psychology.

After diving deep into behavioral science research, body language studies, and interviewing people who just have that ""it"" factor, I figured out the playbook. This is what actually works.

 Step 1: Fix Your Posture Like Your Life Depends On It

Your body is screaming messages before you even open your mouth. Slouching? You're telling everyone you don't matter. Hunched shoulders? You're advertising insecurity like a billboard.

Stand tall. Shoulders back. Chest open. Not in some puffed up gym bro way, but grounded and solid. Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard showed that power posing for just two minutes increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. Translation? Your body chemistry literally changes to make you more confident.

When you walk into a room, move deliberately. Not rushed, not apologetic. Own your space. Take up room. People unconsciously read this as authority and self assurance.

 Step 2: Master the Art of Eye Contact

This one's huge. Eye contact is basically a superpower most people are too scared to use properly. When someone's talking to you, hold their gaze. Not in a creepy staring contest way, but present and engaged. It says ""I'm here, I'm confident, and I value what you're saying.""

Studies from the University of Wolverhampton found that people who maintain appropriate eye contact are perceived as more intelligent, confident, and trustworthy. Breaking eye contact too quickly? You look weak or dishonest.

Here's the trick: Hold eye contact for 3 to 5 seconds before looking away. When you do look away, do it slowly and deliberately. Not down (that's submission) but to the side or while nodding.

 Step 3: Slow Down Everything

Fast movements, rushed actions, fidgeting. All of it screams anxiety and lack of control. People in power move slowly, deliberately, intentionally. Watch any CEO, top athlete, or respected leader. They're never in a frantic rush.

Slow down your gestures. Slow down your walk. Even slow down how fast you reach for your phone or coffee. This is called ""economy of movement"" and it signals that you're in control of yourself and your environment.

Research from Princeton's Social Perception Lab shows that people make competence judgments in milliseconds based on physical movements. Slow, controlled movements = competent and confident.

 Step 4: Create Space and Silence

Most people are terrified of silence. They fill every gap with words, nervous laughter, or small talk. Not you. Get comfortable with silence. When someone finishes talking, pause before responding. Let the silence sit for a beat or two.

This does two things: It shows you're actually thinking about what was said (rare these days), and it demonstrates you're not desperate to fill space. Confident people are comfortable with silence.

In negotiations or important conversations? The person who can sit in silence longest usually wins. It's called the ""strategic pause"" and it's used by top negotiators worldwide.

 Step 5: Stop Seeking Validation

This is the big one. Every time you look around to see if people noticed you, laugh at your own jokes, or explain yourself unnecessarily, you're leaking power. Seeking validation is the fastest way to lose respect.

Do your thing and don't check if anyone's watching. Finish your sentence and don't wait for approval. Make a decision and don't justify it unless asked. When you stop needing external validation, people sense it immediately.

Dr. Robert Cialdini's research in ""Influence"" shows that self-assured behavior without explanation triggers automatic respect responses in others. It's hardwired into social dynamics.

 Step 6: Control Your Reactions

Someone insults you? Don't flinch. Someone tries to get a reaction? Stone face. Bad news drops? Stay calm. This is emotional regulation and it's incredibly powerful.

When you can maintain composure while everyone else is losing their shit, you become the person people look to for stability. It signals strength, maturity, and control.

The Stoics figured this out 2000 years ago, but modern neuroscience backs it up. When you control your emotional reactions, people unconsciously perceive you as more capable and trustworthy. Check out ""The Obstacle Is The Way"" by Ryan Holiday. It's packed with ancient Stoic wisdom applied to modern life. This book will make you question everything about how you handle adversity. Insanely practical.

 Step 7: Take Up Space Confidently

Stop making yourself small. Stop apologizing for existing in a space. Sit with your arms on the armrests. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Don't cross your arms defensively unless you're intentionally signaling ""back off.""

Territorial behavior is primal. Animals do it, humans do it. When you comfortably occupy space without aggression, others read it as confidence and status. Studies in environmental psychology show that people who use open, expansive postures are rated higher in leadership potential.

 Step 8: Dress Like You Give a Damn

Your appearance is nonverbal communication on steroids. You don't need expensive clothes, but you need to look put together, clean, and intentional. Wrinkled shirt and dirty shoes? You're saying ""I don't respect myself enough to care.""

Research from Northwestern University on ""enclothed cognition"" shows that what you wear literally affects your psychological state and how others perceive you. Dress sharp and you'll carry yourself differently. Others will treat you differently.

 Step 9: Master the Handshake and Physical Presence

Firm handshake (not bone crushing, just solid). Make contact web to web, not fingers. Hold for 2 to 3 seconds with good eye contact. This single gesture communicates confidence, trustworthiness, and strength.

When standing in groups, don't hover on the edges. Plant yourself in a stable, grounded position. Feet shoulder width apart, weight evenly distributed. You should look like you could be pushed and not move an inch.

 Step 10: Be Unreactive to Social Pressure

Someone tries to rush you? Move at your own pace. Group wants you to laugh at something you don't find funny? Don't fake it. People try to pull you into drama? Stay neutral.

When you refuse to be swayed by social pressure, you demonstrate internal strength. You're not performing for others. You're operating from your own center. This is magnetic.

For anyone wanting to dig deeper into these concepts through structured learning, there's an AI-powered app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology research, behavioral science books, and expert insights on presence and confidence. You tell it your goal, like ""command respect through body language"" or ""develop unshakeable self-assurance,"" and it creates a personalized learning plan with audio content you can listen to during commutes or workouts.

The depth is customizable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and neuroscience breakdowns. It connects dots between different sources, like the Stoic principles from ""Obstacle Is The Way"" and modern research on power posing. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid and science-backed.

 Step 11: Listen More Than You Talk

Paradoxically, silent attention is one of the most powerful forms of communication. When someone's talking, give them your full presence. No phone checking, no looking around, no planning your response.

Active listening (nodding occasionally, appropriate facial expressions, holding eye contact) shows you're secure enough to let others have the spotlight. Insecure people can't stop talking about themselves. Confident people listen because they don't need to prove anything.

Studies in conversational dynamics show that people who listen well are rated as more intelligent and charismatic than those who dominate conversations.

 Step 12: Walk Away From Disrespect

This is non negotiable. When someone disrespects you, don't argue, don't explain, don't justify. Simply remove yourself from the situation. Walk away calmly.

Nothing commands respect faster than showing you don't need anyone's approval or presence in your life. When you're willing to walk away from disrespect without drama, people learn quickly that you have boundaries and self respect.

This isn't about being cold. It's about demonstrating that your time and energy are valuable. ""Boundaries"" by Dr. Henry Cloud breaks down why this is so critical for healthy relationships and self respect. Essential reading.

The truth is, respect isn't given because you demand it with words. It's earned through how you carry yourself, how you handle pressure, and how you value yourself. These aren't tricks or hacks. They're behavioral shifts that change how the world perceives and treats you.

The system wants you insecure, seeking validation, easy to manipulate. Biology wired us to read body language and nonverbal cues faster than words. When you align your nonverbal communication with genuine self respect, you become someone people naturally respect.

Though even with an external monitor, it still annoys me at times. The M1 however has become victim to a cup of coffee so rip.

Now i'm undecided what to get. If only there was a 14 inch air. Sadly I can't afford the pro. 

I do know the m2,m3,m4 etc have a slightly bigger screen. However i'm thinking of maybe just getting the 15 inch m2 model - as I can get it for a decent price. However. for the same price, I can get a 13 inch air m4.

Then there is the cheapest option, an air M2. Keep in mind all models have 16gb.

  
Finally, I move around a fair bit. Laptop to office, to lounge, to bedroom. Generally used for work, some light video editing and photo editing, affinity etc.

Anyway, which would you guys recommend? Cheers",1,1769617767.0,MacOS,0,1.0,False

I can understand it if he were in a fancy restaurant, but half the time it's when he's in a coffee shop or his own home. As a Canadian, if I lived in fucking Malibu, I'd be wearing shorts every day.",8,1769617747.0,TwoandaHalfMen,7,0.91,False
