A few nights ago I was drinking coffee at Pasteur street, and walk past a lot of I lady bars. 1 girl pulled me in, I was kinda scared because I did not know what they wanted. That a side, I just drunk a beer and bought a cheap lady drink only 100k. Everyone was very friendly to me and the 30 min I was there was 15 euros and I would say it was worth it.

But it seemed like there is more going on there than just a bar. Online I read about scams, robbing and stuff. And I says that you need to watch out, I felt safe and had a good time. 

Can someone please explain what the whole deal is with does bars, is it really dangerous or just a normal bar. I read all kinds of stuff and I just want to know if I should avoid that place or I can go back with the same experience I had. Or that the second time will be a lot different.

If you can help me, I will be great full thank you

Hey folks! I recently traveled to Norway and picked up a bottle of Jägermeister Cold Brew from duty-free. Turns out, my ambitions were greater than my actual drinking capacity, and now I have an opened-but-mostly-full bottle that I can't take back with me.

Instead of letting it go to waste, I figured—why not make someone’s night more interesting? If you're a fan of Jäger (or just up for a random barter), let's swap! Maybe a good coffee, a tasty lunch, or even a local treat in exchange? Open to fun offers—just don’t let me trade this for a salad.

Hit me up if you're interested! Cheers!

1ip5r0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ip5r0w/i_oversleep_every_morning_help/,"I oversleep every morning, help?","Ok for real I need some help. I oversleep almost every day now. For background into info I am on Concerta, and have been since my diagnosis in October last year.

Let’s say I have to leave at 8:00. For my morning routine of breakfast, coffee, bathroom and shower to be completed without stress, I need at least an hour to get ready. So I have to get up at 7:00. In order to get around 8 hours of sleep I need to fall asleep at 23:00 absolute latest.

So far so good! Such a simple schedule to follow and so easy to follow it perfectly right.
Not really…

I snooze every alarm I set. I don’t even remember doing it until I wake up in a panic. It’s like I’m still asleep for the first hour. I’ve tried putting a second IRL alarm clock halfway across the room so I have to get up out of bed to remove the noise. Then I either actually stop feeling sleepy, or I get back to bed still half asleep, only to repeat the pattern.

I feel like I don’t get enough sleep. This is why:

If I’m lucky, I can fall asleep within an hour of going to bed. This means going to bed at 22:00. Although, I can only really fall asleep within an hour if I take some sleep meds (melatonin, promethazine), and this leaves me drowsy the following morning. Usually it takes between 2-3 hours for sleep to find me. So in order to get 8h sleep, if I’m getting up at 7:00, I need to be in bed between 20:00 and 21:00.

So you’re telling me I have to get to bed at a time when many other people finish eating dinner in order to get 8h sleep. Ok sure fine. But I get home at 16. So I get 4 hours of alone time in my own home every day before I need to finish the day. I don’t want to live like this lol.

But the issue really is that I can’t get up in the morning. So WTF do I do….?

The scream boomed through the lamplit neighborhood, accompanied only by the nighttime songs of birds and crickets. ""Granola!"" Startled stray cats danced into the shadows, making way for the two girls. ""Granola,"" the call grew soft in a tired yet undefeated tone. ""Gra—""

""Rose,"" a much weaker, nasally voice came in. ""I think we should call it for now."" A series of pained coughs erupted from her mouth. ""Who knows? Maybe she found her way back home.""

""Maybe,"" Rose knew her sister had already accepted the worst outcome, a common occurrence. ""I think I'll do another lap. Just in case.""

""Thank you so much."" Rose was met with an unwanted, germ-ridden hug from her older sister. ""If you see her, call me immediately, okay?""

""Sure thing,"" Rose replied. Left alone, she turned on some calm music and strolled through the neighborhood once more. Although there were many cats who called the sidewalk their home, none of them particularly resembled Granola. Having exhausted places to look nearby, Rose wandered somewhat far from her house. She knew that, reasonably, her sister's lazy, pudgy cat wouldn't have made its way there, but there was no harm in checking. In all honesty, the only reason she decided to help look for the cat was to get some time away from home, and with the cool wind blowing and the stars adorning the cloudy night sky, Rose saw herself spending the entire night outside.

""Meow.""

Rose heard a faint, shrilly noise through her earbuds. Having taken them off, she listened attentively for another.

""Meow.""

It certainly didn't sound like a cat, much less the long, hissy grumbles customary of Granola, but Rose decided to head towards it anyway. A few turns later, she was met with a silhouette of a woman. She was somewhat tall and walked with a noticeable confidence. She put her hands around her mouth and produced another mew, only to be met back with complete silence. The woman put her hands on her hips, her annoyance understood by Rose, before pacing back and forth for a few seconds. She stopped entirely as her head turned to face Rose. There was a pause where both figures stared at each other, neither making a movement. A panic began to build inside Rose's chest, similar to that of a wild animal having just laid eyes on a predator. This lull was interrupted when one of the street lamps flickered out, leaving them both, for a brief moment, shrouded in darkness. When it came back on, the woman was gone. Every natural instinct told Rose to turn around and leave, and so she did. She didn't make it far, however, before meeting eyes with that same silhouette, this time illuminated by the light overhead. Her hand quickly jutted forward onto Rose's shoulder.

""Have you, by any chance, seen a cat walking by here?"" her voice was serene and accompanied by a warm smile.

""H-how did you get behind me so fast,"" Rose's fear had, partly, been soothed.

""Took a shortcut,"" she responded as if the answer was obvious. ""Now, I really need to know if you've seen a cat passing by."" She placed her other hand on Rose's shoulder and leaned in with a more serious look. At that moment, Rose got a better look at the woman in front of her. She appeared to be wearing black workout clothes with a loose, white top over them, leaving just a bit of her midriff exposed. She also wore glasses which were surrounded by short, black, messy hair.

""No, I haven't,"" Rose responded, ""but I'm also looking for a cat.""

""Oh, geez,"" the woman panicked, letting go of Rose's shoulders. She paced around in a worried state. ""What does it look like?""

""I guess she's..."" Rose stopped for the briefest of moments to come up with a non-insulting descriptor. ""Fat. And ugly. Like, in a mean, always angry-looking kind of way.""

""And her fur?"" the woman asked, as she pulled out her phone and dialed a number.

""Orange.""

The mysterious woman performed a waiting gesture towards Rose. She began to talk to someone on her phone, reciting the description Rose had just given her. ""I'm trusting you guys on this, okay?"" She hung up the phone and turned to the confused girl beside her. ""Don't worry. I have some friends who're gonna help look for your kitty.""

Confusion turned to relief as Rose responded, ""Thanks.""

""It's no big deal. We're looking for the same cat, after all.""

""Wait, what? Why the hell are you looking for my cat?""

The stranger leaned in and spoke with a more serious tone, ""How many people do you think live within a mile of here?"" She stared into Rose's eyes, awaiting a response. It was during this that Rose noticed something was off about that woman's eyes but couldn't figure out exactly what.

""Probably like 2 or 3 thousand,"" Rose gave a very rough estimate.

""Well, your cat right now isn't really herself, and if we don't do something about—"" her words became desperate grasps for air as an appendage wrapped itself around her neck. Rose, panicking, looked down to see that a gaggle of vines had inconspicuously bound both ladies' legs and were quickly spreading. Her first thought was to run, but their tight grip proved too strong. Before Rose had any time to comprehend what had happened, she was completely entangled and imprisoned, being dragged down into a perennial abyss of prehensile vegetation.

The first thing to go was speech. The vines completely restrained Rose's neck and mouth, drowning any attempts at a scream or cry for help. Then was hearing. Any and all noise was overtaken by a squishy wriggling sound, similar to that of a bowl of pasta being repeatedly poked. The woman she was talking to managed to free herself from the vines and ran over to where Rose was. She started digging, ripping and tearing through layers upon layers of sentient greenery, somehow being entirely ignored by the previously aggressive foliage. The rescue became dire as the vines began sinking Rose deeper and deeper into the ground. The light from above was fading as Rose saw the woman open her mouth and yell something. The message was lost in transmission, though she could make out the first word.

""Don't—""

The world turned black soon after, leaving just the slightest of moments for Rose to witness her would-be savior be instantaneously ensnared and pulled into the shadows, though this was not of high concern to the perpetually-descending Rose. She was without any of the senses typical of a conscious being. In this matter, she was not much different than a rock tossed into a pond. Her thoughts were simply the fleeting dreams of ash and dust.

At a time like this one's life would typically flash before their eyes, and so was the case for Rose. In fourth grade, she accidentally knocked over a teacher's coffee mug. It was almost empty and the teacher was fairly forgiving, yet that immediate feeling of embarrassment remained with her almost a decade later. What was that woman trying to tell her? In tenth grade, Rose wrote a poem to a boy she had a crush on. It was nothing spectacular, filled with the cliches and hacky rhymes of sophomoric poetry. She gave it to him one day, before scurrying off out of fear. She was never even sure if he even opened it, considering he never talked to her after that day. Every time she saw him afterwards, she could feel the dagger of regret twisting deeper into her chest. Deeper. Rose was sinking deeper. That she knew. The vines did loosen their hold somewhat, allowing her to breathe freely. In seventh grade, her friend Kori handed her an unmarked soda can, telling her to try it. As any trusting friend would do, she partook in the beverage, only for Kori to tell her it was beer. After about an hour of being convinced that she was drunk and going to be arrested, Rose's friend confessed she had actually just given her root beer. That bastard. Even the vines were nice enough to let her breathe. What did that woman try to tell Rose? Is this it? Your last living breaths and all you can remember are minutiae of humiliation. Maybe, that's the beauty of life. All those little things you try so hard to forget are what really matter. They are what distinguish humans from all other life. After all, a dog never remembers when it urinates in public, but a human sure might. Rose had only done that twice, both immediate emergencies. The motion of the stranger's lips played in repeat in Rose's head. If there was any chance of survival, it would be in deciphering her words. What did she say?

""Breathe.""

""Don't breathe."" Rose snapped back into full consciousness, instinctively panting before completely ceasing all breathing. The downwards movement continued briefly before halting. The vines slid and wriggled all around her without ever pulling her down. It was then that the horror of the current situation caught up to newly sober Rose. Her heart began to race, making it harder to hold her breath. She closed her eyes and focused on the few memories she could dig up: the coffee mug, the love letter, the root beer. Further scenes of shame rushed forward to the front of her mind, distracting from the mounting pain.

A new sound made its way to Rose's ears, one resembling the shuffling of grass and leaves. The black she had become accustomed to was now met with a faint orange shimmer coming from above. The sound grew louder and the glow brighter. A few seconds passed, filling Rose's mind with a delicate mix of hope and fear. A hand pierced the verdant ceiling followed by another. Though they were certainly human hands, they moved like the claws of an animal. They cut down the vines above Rose, revealing the familiar silhouette of that woman falling directly onto her.

""Hey there!"" All of the surrounding vines began violently flinging themselves throughout whatever space they had available. The newly-opened hole to freedom was immediately covered up. The woman who had instructed Rose to stop breathing was now on top of her, breathing quite heavily, in fact. ""You're lucky,"" Rose heard as the descent began anew. ""If you had taken a few more breaths, you'd probably be dead right now."" A red glow began to shine into their shared crevice, this time from below. ""We're almost there. I would have tried going up, but you were so far deep, that going down seemed like the better choice. Plus, it's more fun."" The ambient red lighting had gotten bright enough for Rose to see the woman's face and, more specifically, the devilish smile plastered all over it.

""Fun?"" Rose's rhetorical question was instantly answered as the pair reach the end of their descent and a start of a new one. The ground moved apart to reveal a colossal chamber, walls adorned with the hollowed-out carcasses of animals and humans alike, held up by vampiric vines that had embedded themselves into their circulatory systems. In the center of the room was a giant, worm-like head. It resembled a naked mole rat with no eyes, even having a pair of long, gnarled teeth that were biting indiscriminately at the air. Some of its skin appeared to have been flayed to the point of revealing muscles and blood vessels. Upon noticing the two falling women, it repeatedly slammed its head against the wall, causing a few of the hanging bodies to fall down onto the floor, sublimating into red mist. Settling down, the worm contracted into its own skin, an acidic saliva dripping from its teeth.

""You ready?"" Rose was unwittingly holding on to her rescuer with a bear-like grip as both careened closer and closer to the beast's maw. Once they were within its range, the worm uncoiled itself like a spring, its mouth wide agape and swiftly moving towards the freefalling duo. A blood-curdling scream erupted from Rose's mouth, not unlike what one would hear on a roller coaster. The creature's aim proved true as Rose saw it heading directly for her, and for the second time in the last minute, accepted death. Except this time, it didn't feel quite so peaceful. She closed her eyes and waited for it all to end. And then, there was a snap.

Rose found herself on solid ground again, leaves flying into the air around her. Her head was spinning wildly, and her back and shoulders were bruised. Besides that, however, she made it out with no serious injury, though there was an unexplained sharp pain in her ankle. She looked down to see she had landed on a big pile of leaves. Meanwhile, the crazed woman had slammed head first into a nearby tree. Rose was convinced, at first, that they were both dead but took solace that it was only the other woman that had kicked the bucket.

The pain in Rose's leg was sharp, as if someone was hacking into it with a hatchet. Still on the ground, she looked down and saw one of the vines from before was still latched on to her leg and had buried its way into her skin. Rose still wasn't entirely sure where she was or how she escaped certain death. The answer would become, at least somewhat, apparent when she looked to where the vine was coming from. Around her was a forest, a peculiar one consisting of trees with branches twisting and turning in infinite fractal patterns and with swarms of glowing, multi-colored leaves orbiting the limbs, resembling star clusters spiraling around a supermassive black hole. In the middle of the grove was a blue neon ring with a familiar scene inside: the carnivorous worm monster in its lair, with the heat from within radiating into the surrounding woodland. Coming from inside was the very vine that was digging into her leg. Having accepted the rest of the supernatural phenomena she had just encountered, Rose figured it was some form of portal. She was correct.

""Oh, shoot,"" the woman, previously presumed to have passed, woke up, rubbing her head with a pained expression. ""Looks like we've got a stowaway."" With a snap of her fingers, the portal collapsed, severing the vine from the rest of its body. It continued to wriggle on the ground for a short while, eventually shriveling up enough to allow Rose to remove it without much hassle.

""Are you alright?"" Rose, still lying on the ground, heard coming from beside her. ""Any broken bones? Bleeding? Emotional trauma?""

""A bit of that last one, but pretty good otherwise,"" Rose retorted while sitting up.

""What about your blood sugar?"" This time, the voice came from the sky. Rose looked up slowly, her neck sore from the fall. That same blue portal was now directly above her. Through it, she could see a bedroom, a messy one littered with plushes, toys, and the scattered remains of junk food. The top half of her new friend popped out from the portal upside-down, sweet treats in hand. ""I got some half-eaten oatmeal cookies and a grape soda."" She reached both hands out, but Rose had no particular interest in the days-old cookies. Rose looked at the woman's hands, something striking her as unusual.

""I'll take the soda,"" Rose grabbed the can, in an accepting disbelief of her situation. The woman excitedly bit into her cookies, leaving a barrage of crumbs to fall directly onto Rose.

""Sorry about that. Sometimes, I forget which way is down."" Rose dusted off her pants and shirt. ""Here."" The lady retreated into the hole, closing it on her way out. A few moments pass, then she emerged from a new portal, towel in hand which she promptly gave over to Rose.

As Rose cleaned herself off, the woman continued from when she was interrupted, ""As I was saying, your cat..."" the woman waited for Rose.

""Granola,"" Rose responded.

""Granola isn't really herself right now. If we don't do something about it, the three or so thousand people living nearby would cease to exist.""

Shocked, Rose replied, ""Wait, was that monster—""

""No, no. That was just a construct. A figment of a particular feline's very active imagination. The most it can do is kill you. No biggie.""

""Right,"" Rose disagreed, but had no interest in debating the value of human life at the moment.

""You and everyone else here are trapped inside Granola's dream. As we speak, the barrier between reality and the dream world is falling apart."" She pointed over to a house juxtaposed into the middle of the forest. Rose knew it well, as it was her own home. It was different, though. The paint on the outside was dripping down, revealing grey cobblestone walls reminiscent of a medieval castle. The front lawn was quickly sinking into the ground and filling with water, creating a makeshift moat. Rose looked up to where her bedroom would be, only to see the window had been replaced with an unflattering, stained-glass portrait of her. She stood up and took a step forward before being stopped by the stranger.

""I wouldn't go in there right now. It's still being assimilated into the dream.""

""What about my family?"" Rose actually felt some sense of concern.

""They'll be fine, as long as I can find Granola."" She did a quick look around.

""And what happens if you don't?""

""All of the local reality will become indistinguishable from a cat's dream. That's not too, too bad. The real problem is that, eventually, it has to wake up. And with it..."" the woman let Rose finish the thought.

""We all disappear?"" Rose inquired.

""Bingo. See, death is a transformation, a conversion from one state of being to another, but what we're talking about is complete erasure. Everything you are, have been, and will be will cease to exist. Every memory your friends have of you will seem like a distant dream to them."" Throughout the description of a fate worse than death, the woman didn't seem bothered. In fact, she kept that same smile on her face the entire time. ""So, to avoid that from happening, I'm going to go find that cat and exorcise it.""

""Exorcise? Like a demon?"" Rose, raised in a religious household, held on to a faint fear of all things demonic.

""Yes,"" the woman answered. ""Oh, I guess I forgot to tell you who I am,"" she held her hand out as to receive a hand shake. ""I'm a demon myself."" Rose took another look at her face. Her eyes, which seemed so strange before, were completely white with no pupils or irises. Protruding from her temples were two small, downward-facing horns. The most bizarre aspect, however, was her skin. Until this moment, Rose was unable to notice that the person she had been talking to had a cerulean skin tone. Her initial reaction was to flinch back, yet she did not run away, perhaps in fear of being chased, or maybe because this demon had given her a cold grape soda and potentially saved her life.

""My name is Belle. Nice to meet you."" The demon's outstretched hand was met cautiously by Rose's own. With that gesture, Rose's ordinary, mundane life had unwittingly become intertwined with that of her new friend, the demon Belle.",1,1739520048.0,redditserials,1,1.0,False

This change came shortly after quitting smoking, and one of the things that I removed are sugar, processed food, and junk food in general. The results were interesting. 

[https://imgur.com/a/3Y9WCry](https://imgur.com/a/3Y9WCry)

First of all, I feel significantly better and more energized on a cleaner diet. What I eat on day-to-day basis varies but remains more or less the same. I skip breakfast, I only eat an apply or a banana and some coffee, at lunch I'd have a heavy vegetable-based meal and some eggs, then I'd snack on 2-3 low-sugar chocolate bar to still get that sugar high (but maintain the sugar input below 39g per day) and later I'd snack on some nuts (peanuts are my favorite, I'd sometimes eat a mixture of nuts, depending on how much I do that day). 

Is it the best approach to dieting? Maybe not, is it working? Yes, at the end of the day before sleeping, I just had to accept that I will just feel hungry and there's no escaping that feeling, but what's interesting is that even though I feel hungry at night and sleep well (another benefit from having a balanced diet), I'd wake up the next day maintaining the same weight. This fact alone used to infuriate me in the past, but I grew to just accept it, that even though I'm borderline starving myself (but not really since I am in reality eating at a maintenance level), I still maintain my weight and not lose any... but this is one side of the coin. 

The other sign is, if you look closely into the data, you will find that I am maintaining for the greater part of my days and then there's a sudden drop in weight. This is my trick which has been working so and I will most likely stick to it. On these days, I'm walking, like crazy. Either at work in the office, I go out to meet friends and attend events, to grab groceries....etc. I walk a lot, 8k steps and more, I'd wake up the next day, maintaining my normal food intake, and bam, I'm 300-500g lighter, which is what I love to see. 

How often I walk and how much I eat entirely depend on my schedule. It is motivating now to go out and be more social so we can say it has a silverlining to it, but the day where I don't feel like it or I have too much work (just like last week), i don't force it, I maintain my weight and hope for the best.

This is all signs of abusive relationships, what do you guys think? I cant believe no ones point it out on the page is this just common practise in red pill community?",2,1739519839.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False
1ip5o2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1ip5o2y/i_feel_like_ive_lost_all_connection_to_my_old/,"I feel like I’ve lost all connection to my old life - it’s like it never happened. I have no emotions, sensations or connection besides chronic physical pain","I can't consciously connect with my old life anymore. My DPDR doesn't present as visual or physical anymore. The world looks completely normal. It just doesn't feel normal at all. I've lost all awareness of the world - time, weather, seasons. I feel no emotion- just physical pain. I have vivid dreams and nightmares every night. I don't desire or care about anything, I just work and lay on the sofa because I'm so numb emotionally and my body hurts all day every day. I currently have severe back pain and feel like I can't even bend over to put socks on.

When my DPDR first started I had visual symptoms, the world felt so fake and intense, the sunlight made me feel like I was going to melt, it was just like the intensity of life was turned up 10x. Now it's the completely opposite, the world is completely tuned out, like it's not even there. Things don't look fake - they look normal but I have no involvement in them. I can't connect to my memories anymore. Like I could before, even though they felt far away. Now I just cannot access anything about myself. I don't get any sort of memories coming up that remind me I'm still in there - I have a blank mind and numb body. 

A year ago I felt anxiety still, 2 years ago I was in a panic and completely agoraphobic. I'm not agoraphobic anymore, I don't panic and haven't in 2 years. But when I had anxiety, I could still connect with some emotion and memory of myself, even if everything felt unfamiliar. It's so hard to describe but it's like I'm not a person, not human, don't live in the same reality I did before. 

Living in complete emotional numbness where you don't care about anything, chronic pain,  unable to travel, barely able to function to make money to pay your bills, there's nothing to look forward to, there's no connection with others, I can't even be in the moment at all and enjoy my morning coffee like before DPDR, I was a complex emotional person before this - I feel nothing, not even anxiety. I can't get the feels from music, sex, food, summer. I haven't felt a season or holiday since summer 2022.

I don't know how to move forward when I'm only getting worse - my mind is distancing itself completely, my life never feels like it was my life - but I also have no memory of it. Before it was just unfamiliar, now it's not there. I don't feel connection to my family, emotion toward them, or toward myself. When I think of ""me"" there's nothing that comes up, no relationship to my name, age, what I do for work. I can't believe people look at me and don't see that I've been disconnected for 2.5 years. I went from the happiest person who loved life and traveling - to just a body that can barely function. No sensory experience of the world, no sense of self, no continuous life story, no sleep that isn't filled with nightmares. I just want to feel OK again. I'm tired of suffering, I miss myself so much. I wish I could turn back and get that person again. My life wasn't perfect but it was mine. Even with all this I'm accomplishing so much in my career, and I feel nothing for it. It doesn't even feel like me it's happening to. I don't know how I'm still here - every day is worse than the last. ",1,1739519815.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False

I just bought this Magnifica Plus 2 days ago, and right after setting it up I wanted to create a cup of regular coffee. At first the machine had issues with the amount of coffee beans in the reservoir (tho it was filled enough). And it's been having issues with a good flow since the moment I got it out of the box. I've adjusted the grinding level multiple times (once a time, so no big steps in turning the knob). I've rinsed the machine multiple times to see if water flows through the nozzles, it does.

  
The pucks differ in the tray, sometimes the pucks are nice, solid and dry. But sometimes the pucks are like mud, liquidy. 

I don't want to play too much with it and void any warranty or I'm not really interested in hearing it's an user error to be honest, if I can't fix it today - I'm bringing it back tomorrow. 

You guys have any experience with something like this?

What’s wrong with me?,"I’ve made a post already about my last date with the guy I’m seeing but nothing has changed. It’s been a week, he still hasn’t reach out, acknowledged me, said anything since abandoning our last date while I was so depressed and about to cry. My last text to him was on the 6th, and reads as follows:

“Hello xxxx. So tell me if I’m wrong but I think it’s pretty clear that you’ve given me the impression with your silence that you are no longer interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with me, so can you do me a favor and crush my heart now and tell me you no longer want to go out/date so that I can stop being hopeful that maybe we still had something going on and worth pursuing? I am so hurt and tired and since leaving me while on the verge of tears our last date your solution has been to avoid responding to me I guess. I’m trying to understand xxxx, I know you have your own life, but ignoring me after that is just so rude and inconsiderate of you.”

Still to this day, no response. We went from talking everyday, to meeting up for dates where we goofed around and doodled together, to romantic/sexual flirting, to feeling like I could trust this guy and talk to him about difficult things only to flat out stop talking to me. We had already started talking about our future goals together, how we desired nothing more out of life than to cuddle the days away side by side, body to body and deep in slumber. But now, as I share group therapy with him, I’ve come into class almost every day this week feeling like complete shit, quietly sobbing and straining myself to be as invisible as possible as he just goes about the group as though everything is fine. Don’t get me wrong it doesn’t mean it is and I don’t nor want him to bring our relationship problems into the space, but personally I wear my heart on my sleeve, so every meeting has been truly difficult (and I already don’t care for the group much as is) and I don’t feel like I can engage as much.

I was so excited for not only us but this Valentine’s Day; it would be the first time I’d celebrate in years particularly with a romantic partner and the first romantic Valentines I’ve ever had/asked out. I made him a homemade card that he signed yes to enthusiastically, I bought him a plush of his favorite cartoon character that I was gonna clean up and put a personal voice message in. I bought him a cute mug with some quaint art of his favorite animal on it, I wanted to stuff it with his favorite flavor of coffee complimented by flowers, candy, a customized hat, a bracelet with my nickname for him on it, and another homemade card. I even wanted to get flowers for his l mom and grandmother if only I had the chance to ask, but no.. while it’s not about money I spent what little funds I had left getting him the start to his gifts and now they’re just sitting there with no purpose, just as a wasted, hurtful reminder.

Is it me? Was I/am I so wrong? Was I too much? I thought I could be vulnerable with him, he told me I could, and when we first started talking he made me feel as though he genuinely cared about my well being despite my depression, giving me thorough and thought out responses to my views on life, love, and pain. Yet now I’m just so jaded, like I’m accepting the fact he no longer wants or has time for me. This has happened with every. single. relationship. and I am so broken and tired of getting my hopes up just to be brought down again. I’m so desperate to be loved and love someone, but no matter how I go about it I just can’t make men stay. I don’t feel like I am worthwhile as a partner or even person for that matter. I want to give up on life everyday, I am *exhausted*, but I have no choice but to be here and exist, rot even. I know that I love too hard and too fast, but I try to be respectful of other peoples lives and needs the best I can, but I have needs too. What’s so wrong about me, where am I going wrong? Are my date and I through at this point or do I need to calm down, continue to let him do his thing and live his life without me and just hope and wait that he’ll reach out again to clear the air? Even then I’d be resentful, but maybe it would allow me to understand his experience better, that’s assuming he even feels the same about me still. Regardless, I’ve at least changed my schedule for my group therapy classes today. I just can’t be around him until we can figure things out or he just abandons us entirely..

I don’t get it guys, I don’t want to make my depression and trauma other peoples problems, I’m in multiple therapies just to see if something will change in me, I just want to be the best person that I can for them and myself within life and our relationship. But when my pain starts showing, even if they know and apparently accept me for it, that’s when they start to back away.

A daily battle, a traffic bazaar.
Morning and evening, the chaos remains,
A highway of sorrow, frustration, and pain.

Each day I embark with a sliver of hope,
Yet find myself trapped with no way to cope.
A river of brake lights, a sluggish parade,
As patience dissolves and tempers degrade.

Two lanes? Three lanes? It matters not,
For gridlock's a constant, my soul left to rot.
Expanding, reworking, yet nothing prevails,
Congestion forever, a story that fails.

The only brief moment this freeway once flowed,
Was COVID’s great lockdown, when all were enclosed.
A ghost town of highways, a dream I beheld,
A time when my sanity wasn’t expelled.

But now I sit baking in blinding sunbeams,
Sweat in my eyes as my spirit just screams.
Two hours to travel what should take but twenty,
A wasteland of motion, frustration in plenty.

The air-con is gasping, my patience is fried,
My will to exist slowly withers inside.
I curse at the skyline, I yell at the sky,
I question my choices and ponder just why.

The Swan River glistens, its waters so free,
Unlike this damn freeway, imprisoning me.
Oh, if I could swim to my workplace instead,
I’d trade these long hours of rage and dread.

The radio mocks me with cheerful refrains,
While I boil alive in my metal remains.
A slow-motion nightmare, a feverish plight,
Kwinana, you bastard, you steal my delight.

No fix is forthcoming, no respite in sight,
This freeway of torment, a permanent blight.
So here I remain, my patience all spent,
Forever entrapped in this traffic lament.

So about 4 to 5 years ago I went to my normal doctor complaining about acid reflux (I’ve had this years prior), burning, regurgitating, and shortness of breath. So my doctor went ahead and did a blood test on me and I did test positive for h pylori. I was put on a corse of heavy antibiotics and an acid reducer to get things back in check. I don’t exactly remember the time frame, but after about 2 weeks of meds I did a follow up visit and had a stool sample test done that showed me as negative for h pylori. 

The one thing I did not know at that time was that when you have an h pylori infection, you most likely will get gastritis due to the h pylori eating away your stomach lining and causing inflammation from stomach acid, foods, drinks etc. I’ve never been diagnosed with gastritis, but I have had a an endoscopy (I got this done for free and got paid thanks to a clinical trial) which did not show anything, but no biopsies were done. I have been told to see a gastro, but unfortunately I don’t have health insurance and I know they are not cheap to go see.

Fast forward to now, I’m still dealing with symptoms mainly burning when I wake up, acid, pain dead center under the ribs, and shortness of breath when it feels like a flare. Some of these flares can last hours! Believe it or not, I have never thrown up since having this and can’t even remember when the last time I have, must be 10+ yrs. 

I usually get my worst symptoms consuming things with caffeine and coffee (trying to ween myself off of decaf as I know it’s still bad for my stomach). I don’t drink or smoke at all. I also do not eat out and I do eat a lot of fruits and vegetables in my diet. Dairy, carbonated drinks, and slightly acidic foods like vinegar salads do not bother me much if at all.

Now, my questions are does this actually heal from cases like mine that started from an h pylori infection years ago? Am I continuing this by not really examining and cleaning up my diet to finally recover and heal? 

I know from reading that my case (not trying to self diagnose as I’m not a doctor) is probably chronic since I’ve had these symptoms so long. This truly is miserable and I would not even wish this on my enemies! It also can take a major toll on your mental state as I’ve had anxiety attacks when it really ramps up. It feels like it’s almost debilitating to the point I’m  trapped in my own prison that others don’t fully understand.

Well this is a little longer than I hoped, but any help, experiences, or guidance similar to mine is greatly appreciated. I just want to move on and enjoy life again!",1,1739519167.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Me (35) Female and my Husband (35) male are married for about 4 years. We have a healthy marriage and he has never cheated on me. He's really a nice down to earth man. BUT, he doesn't know how to set boundaries with female friends, maby I'm overthinking it, but there is a line not to cross when it comes to the opposite sex, for me, any emotional intimate (non sexual) conversation is a bit far. Keep it platonic when it comes to conversation on chats. Except if its a conversation coming from both of us in a supportive way. A chat that makes us both feel included in the conversation. 
So we befriended this couple and we were getting along very well until someone came up to me ( This is a friend a trust) telling me that he and our female friend meet eachother at the parking lot, she giggles and likes to lean in when having this conversations, the said the body language just speaks tales, but from his side it look neutral. It went so far that she bought him coffee and took it to his office (FYI we all work at the same place but not the same building) 
I spoke to her about it and told her its a bit strange. She explained she was still in a holiday mood and didn't even realise what it looked like to other people. And people are just bored making up stories. She said she buys coffee for anyone that looks like they had n rough day( she has never bought me coffee and I look like a racoon sometimes or anyone els for that matter). When I spoke to him, he was very shocked and honest and he said that she walks with him every time she sees him and yes they did speak in the parking lot, about work and new ideas for her business one day, but its sort of where they walk past eachother. He did mention he bought her a coffee to say thank you for the one she bought him, but only because she was already there at the work Café. 
So the friendship went to dust anyway cuz now its just weird. I told him I'm not comfortable with her because it feels like her intention may have been a bit otherwise ( I wouldn't do it with her husband, I have no interest having long conversations with him about anything except when we get together as couple's). My husband said he understood and said he can see now what message he was sending out and his sorry. Cool, everything sorted right?
Now I see his checking her status, he doesn't really look at people's statuses? Maby out of 40 he will look at 5 or 6. And her's is one of them? AIO when I feel his interested in her/ her life? Or is he just checking because it's a status. Should I say something? ",3,1739517972.0,AmIOverreacting,9,1.0,False

# 1. Join the TikTok Creativity Program/ Creator Fund

Since 2020 TikTok has offered its most popular creators a program to monetize content. In November 2023 TikTok announced some changes to how this works, depending on where you are located in the world. TikTok are shutting down the Creator Fund for users in the US, UK, Germany and France and replacing it with the [Creativity Program](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creativity-program-beta/) starting December 16th.

TikTok says the new fund will enable creators in these countries to make more money for video uploads over a minute. To join, users must have at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days. Earnings will also be based on views and other TikTok engagement metrics.

Are you a creator in Italy and Spain? Users in these countries can still monetize their profiles through the TikTok Creator Fund. Creators need to hit some prerequisites to join the program and begin receiving money from the platform. Creator Fund members earn money based on the number of engagements they get on their content.

**2. Run TikTok ads**  
About 67% of 18-19 year olds and 56% of 20-29 year olds are on TikTok. This makes TikTok marketing a strong advertising choice for brands wanting to market their products to Gen Z. TikTok ads come with simple, powerful tools to help you advertise to millions of users. Ad formats vary by region, but all let you personalize your targeting by age, location, interest and other factors. You can select one or a few formats that work best for your brand.

The most popular types of TikTok ads include:

**In-feed video:** Appear on the For You Page of TikTok users who meet your targeting parameters.

**Brand takeover:** This lets your ad expand to the width of the whole screen for a few seconds. Then it becomes an in-feed video ad.

**Hashtag challenges**: Create appealing challenges that encourage user-generated content. These challenges appear in the Discovery section on TikTok. This option is only available to managed brands that work in collaboration with TikTok sales representatives.

There are several more types of TikTok ads you can experiment with, but note that some are only available to certain types of accounts.

**3. Collect tips or donations**  
TikTok has introduced a tipping feature that allows select creators to earn money from tips and donations. Fans can use this feature to show gratitude to the creators they love.

Video gifts let viewers send creators virtual gifts and coins. Some creators can collect gifts during a live stream. Gifts can be redeemed for Diamonds—TikTok’s digital currency.

When you save up enough Diamonds, you can trade them for real cash.

https://preview.redd.it/z3fywd1zu1je1.jpg?width=418&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=672b8a8591427e1e09e1db0bb38a76c803982ffa

Creators can also use tipping platforms to earn money. Tipeee, Ko-fi and Buy Me a Coffee can be connected to your TikTok account to function as a tip jar.

**4. Collaborate with a creator**  
To generate revenue on TikTok, leveraging existing popular creators is undoubtedly a strategic shortcut. These creators on TikTok boast a vast fan base and highly engaged communities, and collaborating with them can swiftly elevate the visibility and influence of a brand or product. However, establishing contact with these popular creators and reaching a collaboration agreement is not an easy task.

# 5. Try affiliate marketing

Through affiliate marketing programs, creators and other businesses can promote and sell another company’s products or services for a commission.

To be a successful affiliate marketer, you need to generate sales online. Focus on promoting products that best align with your target audience. Create engaging videos that present affiliate products, showcasing the value and why you recommend purchasing them. Try promoting brands you like and trust, sharing affiliate links or codes to track purchases influenced by your account.

If you’re an in-house marketer, create an affiliate marketing program with clear guidelines and instructions on how to participate. Invite TikTokers who align with your brand values and target audience to participate. Encourage affiliates to promote the products or services that best align with your goals and shared audience. And most importantly, implement a tracking system so you can monitor affiliate performance and commission payments.

# 6. Grow and sell TikTok accounts

Organically growing a TikTok account could take months. However, you can buy an established account to get an instant boost of followers.

To successfully make money selling TikTok accounts, creators should focus on niche topics that can be sustained by the buyer. This will make it easier for the buyer to continue posting similar content and maintain follower engagement.

Brands considering buying an established account should perform due diligence. An account with a lot of followers but low engagement may not provide the return you’re looking for. Also, ensure the account serves an audience you target and the content aligns with your brand and goals.

# 7. Publish sponsored posts

For smaller activations, brands can sponsor posts that live directly on creators’ profiles. Similar to creator collaborations, these campaigns allow brands to pay content creators to promote their products in organic posts. Sponsor single posts or create a series. If it starts trending, you can boost the post to expand its reach even further.

# 8. Sell your products and merchandise

Merchandise, merchandise, merchandise. This tried-and-true strategy applies to TikTok as well. Turn original artwork, quotes or your brand’s logo into merch and promote it on TikTok. Feature your existing products in tutorials or showcase your product alongside a trend.

# 9. Set up a TikTok shop

TikTok partnered with Shopify to launch the [TikTok Shopping](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-ways-to-discover-and-shop-on-tiktok) feature. Brands and creators can become official TikTok merchants and sell directly in the app.

By creating a TikTok Shop, you can showcase products on in-feed videos, lives and product showcase tabs. If [eligible](https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10000749) for this feature, you can signup to become a seller in the [TikTok Seller Center](https://seller.tiktok.com/), where you can manage inventory, orders, creator partnerships, promotions and more. However, the seller center is only available in select regions.

# 10. Offer exclusive content on TikTok

TikTok just launched a new monetization feature in June of 2023 called [TikTok Series](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-a-new-way-for-creators-to-share-premium-content-with-series). This new feature is a way to create exclusive content that lives behind a paywall.

Interested creators can apply to get access to this new feature, but there are other criteria they need to meet as well:

* Creators must be 18+
* Their account must be at least 30 days old
* They must have at least 10,000 followers
* They must have posted 3+ public videos in the last 30 days
* They must have at least 1,000 views in the last 30 days

Creators who have less than 10,000 followers may still be eligible if they can provide a link to premium content they’ve successfully sold on other platforms.

Your Series can include up to 80 videos total, each up to 20 minutes long. This can be a great way to provide valuable educational content to your audience for a one-time fee. You can set the price for each TikTok Series you create, with payment options ranging from $0.99 to $189.99.

# 11. Provide virtual gifts

Another monetization feature is virtual gifts on your videos. People who really enjoy your content can send you virtual gifts as a token of their appreciation—which can then be converted into actual money.

Turn on the gift option to have a small gift box icon appear next to the comment box. Users interested in leaving a gift can tap it to visit this interface:

https://preview.redd.it/dm72wcc6v1je1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef82060cccdf8e48390f23e6673620987aeb9ffa

Coin packages can be bought in the following increments:

* 20 coins: $0.29
* 65 coins: $0.99
* 330 coins: $4.99
* 660 coins: $9.99
* 1,321 coins: $19.99
* 3,303 coins: $49.99
* 6,607 coins: $99.99
* 16,500 coins: $249.99

These coins can then be used to buy and send virtual gifts to a user’s favorite creators, with gifts ranging from 5 to 3,000 coins. Turn on virtual gifts to offer this option to your viewers.

# 12. Host live events or workshops

TikTok Live is another great way to make money. Similar to virtual video gifts, users can also send live gifts. The little gift box icon will appear at the bottom of a live video for users to tap and buy different gifts. The ranges on these are even bigger, with some being just a single coin and others going up to 10s of thousands of coins.

Several TikTok creators have shared how live streaming can be used to make money. One creator makes between $20-$300 every time they go live and another brought in $34,000 within a single month—just from live streaming.

Make sure your live videos are entertaining and valuable so that users keep wanting to tune in. The more consistent viewers you get, the more likely they are to stick around and send you virtual gifts.

# 13. Offer personalized shoutouts

If you have a large following, TikTokers who want to grow their accounts may be willing to pay for personalized shoutouts. Pick a price point and sell shoutouts as yet another way to make money. Your price may be a bit of trial and error. If you’re getting no bites, you may want to lower it. But on the other hand, if you’re getting a ton of interest, you might be able to increase your price.

You can then shout these people out during a live video or during a feed video. You might even choose to offer two different price points (with feed videos costing more) so that users can choose where they’d like to be shouted out.

# 14. Sell digital products

Finally, consider selling digital products. You can create a shop with TikTok and link to your digital products from there, making it easy to make a sale. Promote your products within your videos and include your shop’s URL in your profile so users can easily find it.

**In conclusion**

To conclude, as TikTok continues to thrive as a dominant social media platform, the opportunities for revenue generation are boundless.

Just wouldn’t touch it. Not that I make it often anyway, and because he wasn’t eating it I hadn’t even tried. Then three days ago I was telling him the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears and he said “*I* want some porridge!” I decided to humour him, oats aren’t expensive and we can make it together - he scooped some oats in the pan and poured the milk, then he wanted to make me a coffee while it was cooking so we did that too. When we sat down with our bowl of porridge and mug of coffee I didn’t expect him to even try it but he finished the whole bowl! Then had another before bedtime. Today he had it for breakfast.

1ip4waq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ip4waq/aita/,AITA??,"My boyfriend and I were together for over a year, and at one point, we even considered getting married. But things deteriorated—we struggled to communicate. Whenever I told him I was hurt by something he did, he would turn it around on me, saying I was too sensitive, that I had initiated it, or that what he did wasn’t entirely wrong.

One Friday, we went to a comedy show, but the entire time, he was busy Slacking someone and completely ignored me. I told him, “Maybe finish your message first, and then we can actually hang out.” Turns out, he was writing a long Slack message complaining about a coworker who hadn’t sent him a file at 7 PM on Friday. It took him the whole evening to type that long angry message that was just to vent, and meanwhile on this date I walked to the show alone, sat at the bar alone, and drank my cocktail alone. He completely focused on the phone for almost 2 hours, at some point we sat at the bar together but because of lack of signals he left me sitting there and walked out to continue that angry message.

When he finally came back in, he saw me walking in after buying some takeout alone for dinner (yep, romantic date!). He asked what i got and I answered a bit curtly “some fries”. Then instead of saying, “Thanks for waiting,” or “Sorry that took longer than expected.”, he just showed me his message asking if i wanted to read what wrote in details. Basically took it for granted I waited 2 hours alone.

At the comedy show, I was still irritated and wanted to leave. He responded, “No, I paid $80 for this, so if you want to leave, you can go alone.”

I was deeply hurt but didn’t say anything and left. He walked out with me, but the entire time, he stayed silent. The silence felt unbearable, maybe because I still expected him to say something to acknowledge what had happened. Since the evening was still early, I decided to see a movie. I told him, and he said he wanted to come too, so we walked to the cinema together.

When he realized I had only bought a ticket for myself, he got really mad. That’s when I told him I was upset too—how he had ignored me all evening and how he could have at least said “thank you” or “sorry,” like any normal person would, even on a casual date, let alone with a girlfriend. But he refused to apologize, insisting he had done nothing wrong and claiming I was trying to force him to “cross his boundaries” by making him apologize. Then he refused to listen or talk any longer and stormed off, leaving me alone in the cinema.

At home, we talked about it, and it turned into a huge fight because I wanted him to hear my perspective, but he refused. He said I was being demanding, abusive, and crossing his boundaries because I was raising my voice and talking over him when he didn’t want to listen. I was like, what the actual f-? He had been rude, and now he was twisting it to make it my fault? He even brought up how I had been ""rude"" when I answered him about the fries, saying he didn’t make a big deal out of it. Seriously, I was livid.

Then we broke up. I moved out, but my clothes were at his because his friend came over one day and really disliked seeing me, so she forbidden him from allowing me to enter his apartment WHERE I LIVED. This is a purely non-romantic friend, she lives in Cali and we never met, but she heard that I was abusive to this guy like raising my voices and pressing him so she decided she hated my guts so much she wouldn’t let me in to take my clothes. I got so angry, I called him multiple times, he blocked me and said ask the police if I still wanna come. I didn’t want to deal with this person anymore so I blocked the load of them and flew back to Europe.

That weekeend was in November, we had been broken up for 3 months by now. He reached out to me saying I would have “calmed down” now and he would like to exchange our clothes. I forgot and forgave way too easily plus I wanted my clothes back so we met when I returned to the US. It was the first time we met after the whole thing, and I still had feelings for him. We spent most of the day together, going on a walk, eating in a restaurant, getting some pastries… we also sat together in a coffee shop. It felt lighthearted and open ended. So I asked him this week if he wanted to hang out on Sunday, and he ignored the message completely. I sent him multiple ones asking what’s going on and could we talk, because the last month was confusing and we never had a closure talk. He blocked all of my calls and ignored my texts again. Every single time emotions are involved, he would shut down completely, even left the room in the middle of my sentence like wtf but didn’t like me doing it. He kept mentioning boundaries, is this a healthy way to show them ? Is it me violating his by wanting to talk, or is this him making me really confused?  One time during our arguments when he refused to listen and kept ignoring me, I was so frustrated I raised my voice and threw a box of pasta at him. He told everyone I was assaulting him.

# 1. Join the TikTok Creativity Program/ Creator Fund

Since 2020 TikTok has offered its most popular creators a program to monetize content. In November 2023 TikTok announced some changes to how this works, depending on where you are located in the world. TikTok are shutting down the Creator Fund for users in the US, UK, Germany and France and replacing it with the [Creativity Program](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creativity-program-beta/) starting December 16th.

TikTok says the new fund will enable creators in these countries to make more money for video uploads over a minute. To join, users must have at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days. Earnings will also be based on views and other TikTok engagement metrics.

Are you a creator in Italy and Spain? Users in these countries can still monetize their profiles through the TikTok Creator Fund. Creators need to hit some prerequisites to join the program and begin receiving money from the platform. Creator Fund members earn money based on the number of engagements they get on their content.

**2. Run TikTok ads**  
About 67% of 18-19 year olds and 56% of 20-29 year olds are on TikTok. This makes TikTok marketing a strong advertising choice for brands wanting to market their products to Gen Z. TikTok ads come with simple, powerful tools to help you advertise to millions of users. Ad formats vary by region, but all let you personalize your targeting by age, location, interest and other factors. You can select one or a few formats that work best for your brand.

The most popular types of TikTok ads include:

**In-feed video:** Appear on the For You Page of TikTok users who meet your targeting parameters.

**Brand takeover:** This lets your ad expand to the width of the whole screen for a few seconds. Then it becomes an in-feed video ad.

**Hashtag challenges**: Create appealing challenges that encourage user-generated content. These challenges appear in the Discovery section on TikTok. This option is only available to managed brands that work in collaboration with TikTok sales representatives.

There are several more types of TikTok ads you can experiment with, but note that some are only available to certain types of accounts.

**3. Collect tips or donations**  
TikTok has introduced a tipping feature that allows select creators to earn money from tips and donations. Fans can use this feature to show gratitude to the creators they love.

Video gifts let viewers send creators virtual gifts and coins. Some creators can collect gifts during a live stream. Gifts can be redeemed for Diamonds—TikTok’s digital currency.

When you save up enough Diamonds, you can trade them for real cash.

https://preview.redd.it/z3fywd1zu1je1.jpg?width=418&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=672b8a8591427e1e09e1db0bb38a76c803982ffa

Creators can also use tipping platforms to earn money. Tipeee, Ko-fi and Buy Me a Coffee can be connected to your TikTok account to function as a tip jar.

**4. Collaborate with a creator**  
To generate revenue on TikTok, leveraging existing popular creators is undoubtedly a strategic shortcut. These creators on TikTok boast a vast fan base and highly engaged communities, and collaborating with them can swiftly elevate the visibility and influence of a brand or product. However, establishing contact with these popular creators and reaching a collaboration agreement is not an easy task.

# 5. Try affiliate marketing

Through affiliate marketing programs, creators and other businesses can promote and sell another company’s products or services for a commission.

To be a successful affiliate marketer, you need to generate sales online. Focus on promoting products that best align with your target audience. Create engaging videos that present affiliate products, showcasing the value and why you recommend purchasing them. Try promoting brands you like and trust, sharing affiliate links or codes to track purchases influenced by your account.

If you’re an in-house marketer, create an affiliate marketing program with clear guidelines and instructions on how to participate. Invite TikTokers who align with your brand values and target audience to participate. Encourage affiliates to promote the products or services that best align with your goals and shared audience. And most importantly, implement a tracking system so you can monitor affiliate performance and commission payments.

# 6. Grow and sell TikTok accounts

Organically growing a TikTok account could take months. However, you can buy an established account to get an instant boost of followers.

To successfully make money selling TikTok accounts, creators should focus on niche topics that can be sustained by the buyer. This will make it easier for the buyer to continue posting similar content and maintain follower engagement.

Brands considering buying an established account should perform due diligence. An account with a lot of followers but low engagement may not provide the return you’re looking for. Also, ensure the account serves an audience you target and the content aligns with your brand and goals.

# 7. Publish sponsored posts

For smaller activations, brands can sponsor posts that live directly on creators’ profiles. Similar to creator collaborations, these campaigns allow brands to pay content creators to promote their products in organic posts. Sponsor single posts or create a series. If it starts trending, you can boost the post to expand its reach even further.

# 8. Sell your products and merchandise

Merchandise, merchandise, merchandise. This tried-and-true strategy applies to TikTok as well. Turn original artwork, quotes or your brand’s logo into merch and promote it on TikTok. Feature your existing products in tutorials or showcase your product alongside a trend.

# 9. Set up a TikTok shop

TikTok partnered with Shopify to launch the [TikTok Shopping](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-ways-to-discover-and-shop-on-tiktok) feature. Brands and creators can become official TikTok merchants and sell directly in the app.

By creating a TikTok Shop, you can showcase products on in-feed videos, lives and product showcase tabs. If [eligible](https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10000749) for this feature, you can signup to become a seller in the [TikTok Seller Center](https://seller.tiktok.com/), where you can manage inventory, orders, creator partnerships, promotions and more. However, the seller center is only available in select regions.

# 10. Offer exclusive content on TikTok

TikTok just launched a new monetization feature in June of 2023 called [TikTok Series](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-a-new-way-for-creators-to-share-premium-content-with-series). This new feature is a way to create exclusive content that lives behind a paywall.

Interested creators can apply to get access to this new feature, but there are other criteria they need to meet as well:

* Creators must be 18+
* Their account must be at least 30 days old
* They must have at least 10,000 followers
* They must have posted 3+ public videos in the last 30 days
* They must have at least 1,000 views in the last 30 days

Creators who have less than 10,000 followers may still be eligible if they can provide a link to premium content they’ve successfully sold on other platforms.

Your Series can include up to 80 videos total, each up to 20 minutes long. This can be a great way to provide valuable educational content to your audience for a one-time fee. You can set the price for each TikTok Series you create, with payment options ranging from $0.99 to $189.99.

# 11. Provide virtual gifts

Another monetization feature is virtual gifts on your videos. People who really enjoy your content can send you virtual gifts as a token of their appreciation—which can then be converted into actual money.

Turn on the gift option to have a small gift box icon appear next to the comment box. Users interested in leaving a gift can tap it to visit this interface:

https://preview.redd.it/dm72wcc6v1je1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef82060cccdf8e48390f23e6673620987aeb9ffa

Coin packages can be bought in the following increments:

* 20 coins: $0.29
* 65 coins: $0.99
* 330 coins: $4.99
* 660 coins: $9.99
* 1,321 coins: $19.99
* 3,303 coins: $49.99
* 6,607 coins: $99.99
* 16,500 coins: $249.99

These coins can then be used to buy and send virtual gifts to a user’s favorite creators, with gifts ranging from 5 to 3,000 coins. Turn on virtual gifts to offer this option to your viewers.

# 12. Host live events or workshops

TikTok Live is another great way to make money. Similar to virtual video gifts, users can also send live gifts. The little gift box icon will appear at the bottom of a live video for users to tap and buy different gifts. The ranges on these are even bigger, with some being just a single coin and others going up to 10s of thousands of coins.

Several TikTok creators have shared how live streaming can be used to make money. One creator makes between $20-$300 every time they go live and another brought in $34,000 within a single month—just from live streaming.

Make sure your live videos are entertaining and valuable so that users keep wanting to tune in. The more consistent viewers you get, the more likely they are to stick around and send you virtual gifts.

# 13. Offer personalized shoutouts

If you have a large following, TikTokers who want to grow their accounts may be willing to pay for personalized shoutouts. Pick a price point and sell shoutouts as yet another way to make money. Your price may be a bit of trial and error. If you’re getting no bites, you may want to lower it. But on the other hand, if you’re getting a ton of interest, you might be able to increase your price.

You can then shout these people out during a live video or during a feed video. You might even choose to offer two different price points (with feed videos costing more) so that users can choose where they’d like to be shouted out.

# 14. Sell digital products

Finally, consider selling digital products. You can create a shop with TikTok and link to your digital products from there, making it easy to make a sale. Promote your products within your videos and include your shop’s URL in your profile so users can easily find it.

**In conclusion**

To conclude, as TikTok continues to thrive as a dominant social media platform, the opportunities for revenue generation are boundless.

1ip4tav,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Special-Half-8499/comments/1ip4tav/expose_me_pt_3/,#Expose Me PT 3,"Joshua's screams intensified, a horrifying symphony of pain and terror that echoed through the hospital corridors. The lights flickered violently, casting the room in a strobe-like effect that disoriented the two nurses who had bravely entered. The metal cabinets continued their macabre dance, their doors banging open and shut with increasing ferocity.

The pool of blood on the bed was now a spreading lake, thick and viscous, with dark clots swirling within its depths. The crimson stain was spreading rapidly, soaking through the sheets and onto the floor, turning the sterile white a horrifying shade of red. The nurses could see the blood pulsing, as if it had a life of its own, a grotesque heartbeat that mirrored Joshua's own frantic rhythm.

Suddenly, Joshua's legs thrashed beneath the sheets, his body convulsing violently. He cried out, his voice raw with pain and desperation. ""Please!"" he begged, his eyes wide with terror. ""Make it stop! Please!""

The nurses exchanged a horrified glance. They were helpless, their medical training failing them in the face of such an inexplicable and gruesome phenomenon. They could only watch in horror as Joshua's body continued to spasm, the blood flowing from him in an unending torrent, the clots growing larger, more grotesque. The room was becoming a scene out of a nightmare, a mona lisa of pain and suffering.

Tristan woke with a start, disoriented and confused. He was in his basement bedroom, the familiar scent of damp earth and old books filling his senses. He blinked, his eyes adjusting to the dim light filtering through the small window. He wasn't alone. A figure lay beside him, her face obscured by the tangled sheets. He remembered now—Anya, the model from Josh's shoot.

""Well, good morning!"" he chirped, a playful grin spreading across his face. He stretched languidly, his naked body momentarily illuminated by a stray beam of sunlight. He slipped out of bed and into his worn robe, the soft fabric a comforting contrast to the cool morning air.

He padded over to the small kitchenette in the corner of the room and flicked on the coffee machine. The familiar gurgling sound was a welcome start to the day. He grabbed the remote and turned on the small TV mounted on the wall, flipping through the channels until he landed on the morning news.

The cheerful banter of the anchors was abruptly interrupted by a breaking news report. Tristan's smile faltered as he saw the image flash across the screen: a black SUV, police tape cordoning off the area, a familiar beach in the background.

""Police are investigating a gruesome discovery this morning,"" the anchor announced, her voice somber. ""The body of a young woman was found in a parked car near the beach. The victim has been identified as Jessica Miller, ex-wife of Joshua Carpenter, who is currently hospitalized following a…"" the anchor paused, ""...a disturbing incident.""

The image on the screen changed, showing a close-up of the SUV's backseat. Tristan's blood ran cold. He recognized the dress, the hanger… the blood. He dropped his coffee cup, the ceramic shattering against the floor. He didn't need to hear the rest of the report. He knew.

""Oh my god,"" he gasped, his voice a strangled whisper. He spun around, his eyes wide with horror. Anya was still asleep, oblivious to the news. He stumbled back, his hand flying to his mouth to stifle a scream. He didn't need to check. He knew what he would find.

""No, no, no!"" he screamed, his voice raw with terror. He scrambled back, tripping over the scattered clothes on the floor. He scrambled to his feet and ran out of the room, his robe billowing behind him.

""I need to get to the hospital!"" he yelled, his voice echoing through the empty house. ""Now!""

Anya stirred, blinking sleepily as Tristan rushed past her, his face a mask of panic. ""What's wrong?"" she asked, her voice still thick with sleep, but a flicker of genuine concern in her eyes.

""Your ex-boss needs me,"" he replied curtly, grabbing his keys and wallet from the dresser.

""Josh?"" she asked, her eyes widening with concern. Tristan simply nodded, his expression grim.

Anya sat up, pulling the sheet around her. ""Oh, that's terrible,"" she murmured, her brow furrowing. ""It sucks that I don't see him working anymore. He was always so nice and respectful to everyone. He even gave me extra tips sometimes, you know, when he knew I was saving up for my apartment."" She paused, a small, genuine smile gracing her lips. ""He was a good guy. Really.""

Something about Anya's casual praise of Josh, the way she spoke about him with such fondness, pricked at Tristan. The mention of tips, the genuine warmth in her voice when she spoke of him… it all stirred a strange mix of jealousy and unease in his gut. He bit his lip, trying to suppress the irrational irritation that flared within him. He knew it was ridiculous, but the thought of Anya, even briefly, admiring Josh, stirred something unpleasant inside him. He’d seen the way Josh looked at Anya, too. That professional admiration that seemed to linger a little too long.

""Alright,"" he said, his voice a little sharper than he intended. ""You can come with."" He couldn't explain why he wanted her there. Perhaps it was a morbid curiosity, a need to see her reaction to… everything. Or maybe it was just a desperate attempt to not be alone when he faced whatever awaited him at the hospital. But as he looked at Anya, at the genuine concern etched on her face, he wondered if there was something more. Something he wasn't quite ready to admit.

Tristan and Anya arrived at the hospital, a heavy silence hanging between them. They hurried through the sterile corridors, the rhythmic beeping of machines and hushed whispers of staff a stark contrast to the chaos swirling inside Tristan’s head. They reached Joshua’s room, the door slightly ajar. Tristan pushed it open, expecting to find Joshua in the bed, still recovering from his horrific injuries.

The room was empty.

The bed was made, the crisp white sheets undisturbed. No Joshua.

Tristan exchanged a bewildered look with Anya. ""Where… where is he?"" he stammered, his heart beginning to pound.

A nurse rushed in, her face etched with confusion. ""He was just here a few minutes ago,"" she said, her voice trembling slightly. ""I went to get some medication, and when I came back…"" She trailed off, shaking her head.

Panic began to set in. They called for security, the hospital going into lockdown. Staff members were questioned, every room searched. But Joshua was nowhere to be found. It was as if he had vanished into thin air.

As the hospital buzzed with frantic activity, Tristan stood in the empty room, his mind racing. The bartender’s words from the night before echoed in his ears: *“…cost her the life of her unborn child… lost his shit, shoved her down the stairs… everyone’s got a dark side…”* He’d dismissed it then, brushed it off as bar gossip. But now, with Joshua’s disappearance, with the monstrous thing he’d witnessed in the hospital room, the bartender’s words took on a new, sinister meaning. He thought of the two women at the bar, their spectral forms, their bloody wounds. He thought of the chilling look in Joshua’s eyes, the whispers, the screams. He thought of Jess, and the gruesome discovery at the beach.

A wave of dread washed over him. What the hell was going on? Where was Josh? And what had he become? The questions swirled in his mind, unanswered, each one more terrifying than the last.

Tristan left Anya standing in the hospital corridor, his mind reeling. He needed to be alone, to process the terrifying thoughts that were consuming him. 

The fluorescent lights of the hospital bathroom flickered, casting grotesque shadows that danced across Tristan’s face. He looked in the mirror and saw… something else. His reflection was there, but it was overlaid with something monstrous, a flicker of darkness that twisted his features into a chilling parody of his former self. He felt lacerations, phantom pains that were all too real, a grotesque echo of the injuries he had witnessed on the spectral figures at the bar. It wasn't just whispers about Josh anymore; it was a deafening roar of accusations, a chorus of condemnation that echoed in his skull. *The feast is prepared… the debt is owed…* they screamed. He could hear the girls screaming in the background, the whirring of power drills, and laughter… but it wasn't Josh's laughter. It was *his*.

He spun around, and there he was. Josh. But not the Josh he knew. This was something else, something… *inhuman*. His eyes burned with an otherworldly light, a malevolent glow that seemed to pierce Tristan’s very soul. His features were no longer recognizable, twisted into a grotesque mask of rage and sorrow.

""The bargain is struck… the price is paid…"" Josh rasped, his voice a chilling echo of the whispers in Tristan's mind. ""The cycle continues… the reaping begins…"" He paused, his gaze fixed on Tristan, a single tear tracing a bloody path down his cheek. ""The seed is planted… the fruit is rotten… You've turned me into this, and now I see… the rot spreads.""

Suddenly, Tristan's body began to feel like it was being ripped apart, an invisible force tearing at his flesh, his bones grinding and snapping. He screamed, the sound raw with terror, a primal shriek of pure agony. ""Oh God, Josh! Help me, please!""

""You offered them the cup… you spilled the wine… you devoured the heart…"" Josh roared, his voice filled with a righteous fury that made Tristan's blood run cold. ""It was *you*.""

The accusation struck Tristan like a physical blow, a hammer blow to the core of his being. The denial, the carefully constructed facade of innocence, shattered. Something inside him shifted, a dark, primal instinct rising to the surface, fueled by the terror and the pain. His fear was replaced by a cold, calculating rage. His expression changed, his eyes narrowing, a cruel smile twisting his lips. The transformation was complete. The mask had slipped, revealing the monster beneath. This was the climax, the horrifying revelation of the true nature of the evil that had been unleashed. Josh, however, remained unphased. He had seen this before. He had *caused* this. He knew what was coming.

The fluorescent lights flickered and buzzed, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the blood-spattered bathroom. Tristan, his face contorted in a mask of pain and perverse delight, leaned against the sink, his body wracked with invisible torments. ""I'll come clean, Josh,"" he gasped, his voice a gruesome symphony of agony and triumph. ""It was me. I killed those girls at the bar."" He paused, relishing the horror dawning in Josh's eyes. ""They're in the crawlspace,"" he continued, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, a chilling counterpoint to his ragged breathing. ""Anya was going to be next. But… we decided on a different target. Someone who would throw the investigation off your scent, someone close to you, someone no one would suspect."" He met Josh's gaze, his eyes burning with a chilling, predatory hunger. ""You see, Josh… I killed Jess. And it was… exquisite. The way her eyes went blank… the way the life just drained out of her…"" He trailed off, a shudder running through his body, a mixture of remembered pleasure and lingering pain.

The words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of unimaginable cruelty. Josh's face crumpled, the otherworldly rage that had consumed him moments before dissolving into a raw, soul-crushing grief. He crumpled to his knees, his body wracked with sobs, the reality of what Tristan had done hitting him with the force of a physical blow. Jess… gone. Truly gone. He had lost her, and it was his fault. He had brought this upon them all.

Tristan, reveling in Josh's despair, pressed on, twisting the knife deeper. ""And to make matters worse,"" he hissed, his voice dripping with venom, ""that was *your* kid she was carrying. She was going to leave you, Josh. She couldn't stand the sight of you anymore. She told me… she told me she felt *disgusted* by you, by what you were becoming. She said I made her feel… alive. Like she mattered."" He let out a harsh, broken laugh, the sound grating against the sterile silence of the hospital bathroom. ""But hey,"" he said, his voice softening, taking on a mockingly sympathetic tone, ""not everything can work out, right? Especially not for you.""

Then, with a sudden, swift movement, Tristan lunged forward, grabbing Josh by the hair. He pulled his head back, exposing his throat, the movement surprisingly strong despite the obvious pain he was in. ""And now,"" he whispered, his voice a venomous hiss, ""it's your turn. Time to pay the piper."" He brought his face close to Josh's, their eyes locking. ""Any last words, old friend?""

Just as Tristan's grip tightened, the bathroom door burst open. Doctors and nurses flooded in, their faces a mixture of alarm and confusion. They rushed towards Tristan, pulling him away from Josh, their voices a cacophony of urgent commands.

Tristan, caught off guard, released Josh and stumbled back, his eyes wild, his body still wracked with invisible torment. He looked around the room, his gaze darting from one face to another, a desperate animal trapped in a cage. He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Only a guttural scream, a sound of pure, unadulterated rage and despair.

As the medical staff restrained Tristan, his gaze fell upon the mirror behind him. It was cracked, spider-webbed with fissures from his earlier outburst. But now, as he stared at it, the cracks began to multiply, spreading across the glass like lightning strikes. The reflection in the mirror shifted and distorted, no longer showing Tristan's face, but a kaleidoscope of faces – the bartender, the gossiping patrons from the bar, the nurses who whispered about Josh, even Anya, her face contorted in a mixture of fear and fascination. The mirror shattered completely, showering the room with shards of glass. But in each shard, a single, terrified face was reflected, multiplied tenfold, a chilling testament to the expanding circle of blame and the inescapable nature of the curse. The cycle wasn't broken. It had just begun, amplified, and now it was everyone's turn.

The mirror shattered, sending shards of reflected terror across the blood-spattered bathroom floor. As the glass rained down, a wave of unease rippled through the hospital, far beyond the bathroom walls. It wasn't just sickness anymore. It was something…else. A strange tension filled the air, a palpable shift in the atmosphere. The screams that followed were different, too. They weren't cries of pain or illness, but sounds of raw, unadulterated terror, laced with a strange, almost ecstatic edge.

People began to move erratically, their bodies jerking and twitching like puppets on invisible strings. A nurse, her eyes wide and vacant, suddenly began to methodically bang her head against a nearby wall, the sickening thud echoing through the corridor. A patient in a wheelchair, his face contorted in a grotesque smile, wheeled himself towards a closed window and rammed into it repeatedly, the glass spider-webbing with each impact. Another patient, seemingly unaffected, calmly walked to the window, opened it, and then jumped. The shattering glass and the sickening thud from below marked his descent. A doctor began clawing at his own face, his fingers tearing at his skin, leaving bloody trails in their wake. It was as if an invisible force was driving them, compelling them to acts of self-destruction, each act more bizarre and violent than the last.

In the cafeteria, a group of people began smashing plates and cups against their heads. A man in the waiting room calmly pulled out a pocket knife and began slicing at his arm.

Amidst the growing chaos, Anya, her face pale but determined, grabbed Josh's arm. She could feel it too, the strange energy in the air, the sense of impending doom. She knew Tristan was behind this, somehow. He was out there, hunting Josh, and they had to escape.

""We have to go,"" she urged, her voice trembling but firm. ""Now.""

Josh, still reeling from the revelation of Tristan's betrayal and the horrific things he had confessed to, looked at her, his eyes filled with confusion and fear. He nodded slowly, understanding dawning in his eyes. He could feel it too, the darkness that was spreading, infecting everyone around them.

They stumbled out of the bathroom, the scene in the hallway a grotesque tableau of horror. People were harming themselves in increasingly bizarre and violent ways. A man was calmly strangling himself with his tie. A woman was methodically smashing her fingers with a hammer. The air crackled with a strange energy, a silent hum that vibrated in their bones. The screams were incessant, a chorus of madness that filled the hospital.

Anya and Josh pushed their way through the throng of self-destructive individuals, their movements quick and desperate. They reached the nearest exit, a fire escape door. Anya yanked it open, and they stepped out into the cool night air, the sounds of the hospital fading behind them. They didn't stop running until they were far from the building, the imposing structure looming behind them like a monument to human suffering. They knew they weren't safe, not anymore. The evil was out, and it was everywhere. And they were running for their lives.

They stumbled out of the fire escape and into the cool night air, the cacophony of screams and self-inflicted violence fading behind them. Josh collapsed against the brick wall of the hospital, his body shaking with sobs. He wept openly, a raw, guttural sound of grief that tore at the silence of the night. He was mourning Jess, the woman he had loved, the future they had planned. He was mourning the baby, a child he hadn't even known existed, a potential family that was now lost forever. He was mourning the possibility of reconciliation, the hope that Jess would return to him, a hope that was now brutally extinguished. He realized with a sickening certainty that when she left him, she wasn't truly gone from his heart, but now… now she was gone forever, stolen from him by a senseless act of violence.

Anya, her own heart heavy with fear and uncertainty, looked around nervously, scanning the shadows for any sign of pursuit. The hospital loomed behind them, a dark and silent monolith. Seeing no one, she turned back to Josh, her face etched with concern. She sank down beside him, wrapping her arms around him tightly. ""It's going to be okay, Josh,"" she whispered, her voice trembling slightly. ""It's going to be okay.""

He shook his head, his sobs intensifying. ""No, it's not,"" he choked out, his voice thick with tears. ""I'm a piece of shit, Anya. I'm not good enough. Look what I've done. Look what I've caused."" He gestured vaguely towards the hospital, the image of the chaos within still fresh in his mind. ""I deserve this. I deserve everything that's happening to me.""

Anya held him tighter, her own fear momentarily forgotten in the face of his pain. ""No, Josh,"" she said firmly, her voice gaining strength. ""That's not true. You're not a piece of shit. You're a good man who's been through something unimaginable. You've been hurt, betrayed, manipulated. And you're grieving. It's okay to grieve. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel lost. But don't let this… don't let what Tristan did define you. Don't let it turn you into something you're not.""

She paused, searching for the right words, words that could offer some solace in the face of such overwhelming darkness. ""You are worthy of love, Josh,"" she continued, her voice soft but unwavering. ""You are worthy of happiness. Don't let anyone, not even yourself, convince you otherwise. What happened to Jess, to the baby… it's a tragedy. A horrific tragedy. But it's not your fault. You didn't choose this. You were a victim too.""

She looked at him, her eyes filled with a fierce determination. ""You have a choice now, Josh. You can let this destroy you, let it consume you. Or you can choose to heal. You can choose to fight. You can choose to remember the good in your life, the love you shared with Jess, the man you were before all this happened. It won't be easy. It will be the hardest thing you've ever done. But you can do it. You have the strength inside you. You just need to find it again."" She paused, then added softly, ""And you don't have to do it alone.""

Josh continued to weep, the tears a mixture of grief, guilt, and a profound loneliness. He thought of Jess, and the isolation that had plagued him even when they were together. He had been poorly isolated, lacking a true support system, his world revolving solely around her. Tristan had been his closest friend, his only real confidante, but Josh had drifted away after hearing unsettling rumors about him. Later, seeing both of them achieve success, he’d reasoned that people outgrew old gossip and rekindled the friendship, a decision he now bitterly regretted. After Tristan, there had been no one. Just Jess. And now… she was gone.

Seeing Anya there, with him, a flicker of warmth amidst the icy grip of despair, filled him with a surge of emotion so intense he didn’t know how to process it. It was a fragile hope, a lifeline in the darkness, and he clung to it desperately. He reached out and hugged her, a clumsy, almost desperate embrace. He needed the human contact, the warmth, the reassurance that he wasn't completely alone in the world.

Anya, surprised by the suddenness of the hug, embraced him back, holding him tightly. She felt the tremors that wracked his body, the raw, visceral pain that radiated from him, and her heart ached with a deep, unsettling empathy. She respected him immensely for opening up about his struggles, for acknowledging his vulnerability in such a raw and honest way. It was a rare and courageous thing, especially in the face of such overwhelming grief and the palpable terror that clung to the very air around them. Seeing him so broken, so utterly lost, brought tears stinging to her own eyes. She held him tighter, offering silent comfort, a fragile human connection in a world that had suddenly become terrifying and unpredictable.

The ground beneath them began to tremble, a low, guttural rumble that vibrated through their feet and into the very core of their being. Anya initially dismissed it as aftershocks, her nerves still frayed from the horrific violence she had witnessed at the hospital. But the rumbling grew stronger, more insistent, escalating into a deep, earth-shaking groan that seemed to emanate from the very bowels of the earth. The distant streetlights flickered erratically, then died one by one, plunging the park into an almost suffocating darkness, punctuated only by the faint, eerie glow of the hospital in the distance.

Josh pulled away, his eyes wide with a terror that mirrored and amplified her own. He scanned the shadows, searching desperately for the source of the disturbance, his breath catching in his throat. ""What's happening?"" he whispered, his voice hoarse with fear.

Before Anya could answer, the air around them crackled with an unseen energy, a palpable shift in the atmosphere. A low hum, almost imperceptible at first, resonated in the air, then escalated into a high-pitched whine that vibrated in their bones, making their teeth chatter. The hair on their arms stood on end, and a prickling sensation crawled across their skin.

Suddenly, the sky above them ripped open, not with the gentle, familiar light of the moon, but with a blinding, otherworldly luminescence. A swirling vortex of light and color materialized directly above the hospital, a gaping maw in the fabric of reality, casting an eerie, pulsating glow across the trembling landscape. It throbbed with an unnatural power, a gateway to something ancient, something unspeakably terrifying.

From the swirling vortex, monstrous shapes began to emerge, silhouetted against the blinding light. They were colossal, grotesque, and utterly alien, their forms defying earthly biology, their movements fluid and unsettling. They descended slowly, silently, their forms casting long, distorted shadows that danced and writhed across the trembling earth, transforming familiar trees and park benches into monstrous parodies of themselves.

The ground bucked beneath them, the rumbling now a deafening roar that drowned out all other sound. The air crackled with raw energy, and the high-pitched hum intensified, reaching a piercing shriek that made their ears ring and their heads pound. The world around them seemed to be fracturing, distorting, as if the very laws of physics were unraveling.

Then, Tristan appeared. He wasn't among the descending figures, but he was there, at the edge of the park, bathed in the eerie light from the vortex. He was no longer recognizable as the man they knew. His body was twisted and grotesque, a nightmarish caricature of his former self, a physical manifestation of the darkness that consumed him. His eyes burned with a malevolent glee, a chilling triumph that made Anya's blood run cold.

He gestured towards the sky, towards the descending monstrosities, and then towards Josh, his movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet manipulated by unseen strings. ""The reckoning has begun,"" he rasped, his voice a chilling echo of the whispers that had tormented Josh. ""The price… must be paid.""

Anya screamed, a primal sound of terror and desperation that tore through the night. She knew what was coming. She knew what Tristan wanted. She knew, with a chilling certainty that settled deep in her bones, that he wanted Josh. She shoved him behind her, putting herself between him and the monstrous figure, her heart pounding in her chest. ""Run, Josh!"" she shrieked, her voice cracking with fear. ""Please… run!""

Tristan lunged, his movements inhumanly fast, a blur of motion too quick for the human eye to follow. He struck Anya with a force that sent her reeling. The impact wasn't a clean blow; it was a savage, tearing strike that ripped through her flesh and bone. She gasped, her eyes widening in disbelief and excruciating pain as she crumpled to the ground, her body twisted at an unnatural angle. She tried to speak, to cry out, but only a gurgling sound escaped her lips as blood pooled around her. Her gaze was fixed on Josh, a silent plea for him to escape, to survive. Then, her eyes glazed over, the light fading from them as her lifeblood drained away.

Josh watched in frozen horror as his last chance for hope, his last connection to humanity, was extinguished before his very eyes. He felt a surge of rage, a white-hot fury that threatened to consume him, to transform him into the very monster he feared. But then, he saw Anya's face, her eyes pleading with him, begging him to run, to survive. He saw Jess's face in his mind, her smile, her love, and he knew he couldn't. He wouldn't. He wouldn't let the darkness win.

He wouldn't become the monster they all feared.

He wouldn't let Anya's sacrifice be in vain.

He wouldn't let Jess down.

He closed his eyes, took a deep, shuddering breath, and made his choice. He wouldn’t fight Tristan. He wouldn’t give in to the rage. He would accept. He would accept his fate, whatever it might be. He would accept the pain, the grief, the terror. He would accept it all, and he would not let it break him. He would not become a monster.

He opened his eyes, and looked at Tristan, not with fear, but with a profound sadness, a quiet understanding. He knew what he had to do. He had to break the cycle. He had to stop the rot. And he knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his soul, that this was the only way. He wouldn't run. He wouldn't fight. He would simply… be. And in his acceptance, in his unwavering refusal to succumb to the darkness, he found a strength he never knew he possessed. He was ready.

...And then, as the monstrous figures reached the earth, as Tristan lunged towards him, Josh closed his eyes, and the world went dark. Not with the terror of death, but with the quiet acceptance of a man who had chosen to be better than the darkness that surrounded him.

""Goodbye, cruel world,"" he whispered, a final, heartbreaking farewell.

A blinding flash of light erupted from Josh, a surge of pure, selfless energy that engulfed the park. The monstrous figures shrieked and recoiled, their forms dissolving into wisps of smoke. Tristan, caught in the blast, was thrown back, his twisted body contorting in agony as the light burned away the darkness that clung to him.

When the light subsided, Josh was gone. There was no body, no trace of him left. Only a lingering warmth in the air and a profound silence.

The world was still, the only sound the gentle rustling of leaves in the night breeze. Anya's body lay on the ground, a tragic reminder of the sacrifice that had been made. But there was a sense of peace, a feeling that something had shifted, that the darkness had been held at bay.

Tristan, weakened and disoriented, stumbled away, his power diminished. The evil that had possessed him was not gone, but it was wounded, its grip loosened. He was still a danger, but the immediate threat was over.

And so, we are left to ponder the events of this dark tale. It is more than just a horror story. It’s a chilling exploration of the darkness that lurks within us all, the insidious nature of evil, and the devastating power of words. It reminds us that the real monsters often wear human faces, that the whispers and rumors we so readily believe can have consequences far more terrifying than any supernatural threat.

It’s a cautionary tale, a stark warning about the dangers of judgment, the ease with which we condemn others based on hearsay and speculation. It forces us to confront our own capacity for cruelty, our willingness to participate in the spread of misinformation, the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes.

But amidst the darkness, there is also a glimmer of hope. Josh's selfless act, his unwavering refusal to succumb to the darkness, reminds us that even in the face of unimaginable horror, humanity can choose good. His sacrifice serves as a powerful testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit, the ability of individuals to find courage and compassion even in their darkest hour.

This is a story about the power of words, the danger of rumors, and the enduring strength of the human spirit. It’s a cautionary tale, a reminder that we should be careful what we believe, and even more careful what we say. Because the whispers… they can create monsters. But they can also inspire heroes. And in the end, it's up to us to choose which path we will follow. The choice, dear reader, is always ours.

# 1. Join the TikTok Creativity Program/ Creator Fund

Since 2020 TikTok has offered its most popular creators a program to monetize content. In November 2023 TikTok announced some changes to how this works, depending on where you are located in the world. TikTok are shutting down the Creator Fund for users in the US, UK, Germany and France and replacing it with the [Creativity Program](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creativity-program-beta/) starting December 16th.

TikTok says the new fund will enable creators in these countries to make more money for video uploads over a minute. To join, users must have at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days. Earnings will also be based on views and other TikTok engagement metrics.

Are you a creator in Italy and Spain? Users in these countries can still monetize their profiles through the TikTok Creator Fund. Creators need to hit some prerequisites to join the program and begin receiving money from the platform. Creator Fund members earn money based on the number of engagements they get on their content.

**2. Run TikTok ads**  
About 67% of 18-19 year olds and 56% of 20-29 year olds are on TikTok. This makes TikTok marketing a strong advertising choice for brands wanting to market their products to Gen Z. TikTok ads come with simple, powerful tools to help you advertise to millions of users. Ad formats vary by region, but all let you personalize your targeting by age, location, interest and other factors. You can select one or a few formats that work best for your brand.

The most popular types of TikTok ads include:

**In-feed video:** Appear on the For You Page of TikTok users who meet your targeting parameters.

**Brand takeover:** This lets your ad expand to the width of the whole screen for a few seconds. Then it becomes an in-feed video ad.

**Hashtag challenges**: Create appealing challenges that encourage user-generated content. These challenges appear in the Discovery section on TikTok. This option is only available to managed brands that work in collaboration with TikTok sales representatives.

There are several more types of TikTok ads you can experiment with, but note that some are only available to certain types of accounts.

**3. Collect tips or donations**  
TikTok has introduced a tipping feature that allows select creators to earn money from tips and donations. Fans can use this feature to show gratitude to the creators they love.

Video gifts let viewers send creators virtual gifts and coins. Some creators can collect gifts during a live stream. Gifts can be redeemed for Diamonds—TikTok’s digital currency.

When you save up enough Diamonds, you can trade them for real cash.

Creators can also use tipping platforms to earn money. Tipeee, Ko-fi and Buy Me a Coffee can be connected to your TikTok account to function as a tip jar.

**4. Collaborate with a creator**  
To generate revenue on TikTok, leveraging existing popular creators is undoubtedly a strategic shortcut. These creators on TikTok boast a vast fan base and highly engaged communities, and collaborating with them can swiftly elevate the visibility and influence of a brand or product. However, establishing contact with these popular creators and reaching a collaboration agreement is not an easy task.

# 5. Try affiliate marketing

Through affiliate marketing programs, creators and other businesses can promote and sell another company’s products or services for a commission.

To be a successful affiliate marketer, you need to generate sales online. Focus on promoting products that best align with your target audience. Create engaging videos that present affiliate products, showcasing the value and why you recommend purchasing them. Try promoting brands you like and trust, sharing affiliate links or codes to track purchases influenced by your account.

If you’re an in-house marketer, create an affiliate marketing program with clear guidelines and instructions on how to participate. Invite TikTokers who align with your brand values and target audience to participate. Encourage affiliates to promote the products or services that best align with your goals and shared audience. And most importantly, implement a tracking system so you can monitor affiliate performance and commission payments.

# 6. Grow and sell TikTok accounts

Organically growing a TikTok account could take months. However, you can buy an established account to get an instant boost of followers.

To successfully make money selling TikTok accounts, creators should focus on niche topics that can be sustained by the buyer. This will make it easier for the buyer to continue posting similar content and maintain follower engagement.

Brands considering buying an established account should perform due diligence. An account with a lot of followers but low engagement may not provide the return you’re looking for. Also, ensure the account serves an audience you target and the content aligns with your brand and goals.

# 7. Publish sponsored posts

For smaller activations, brands can sponsor posts that live directly on creators’ profiles. Similar to creator collaborations, these campaigns allow brands to pay content creators to promote their products in organic posts. Sponsor single posts or create a series. If it starts trending, you can boost the post to expand its reach even further.

# 8. Sell your products and merchandise

Merchandise, merchandise, merchandise. This tried-and-true strategy applies to TikTok as well. Turn original artwork, quotes or your brand’s logo into merch and promote it on TikTok. Feature your existing products in tutorials or showcase your product alongside a trend.

# 9. Set up a TikTok shop

TikTok partnered with Shopify to launch the [TikTok Shopping](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-ways-to-discover-and-shop-on-tiktok) feature. Brands and creators can become official TikTok merchants and sell directly in the app.

By creating a TikTok Shop, you can showcase products on in-feed videos, lives and product showcase tabs. If [eligible](https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10000749) for this feature, you can signup to become a seller in the [TikTok Seller Center](https://seller.tiktok.com/), where you can manage inventory, orders, creator partnerships, promotions and more. However, the seller center is only available in select regions.

# 10. Offer exclusive content on TikTok

TikTok just launched a new monetization feature in June of 2023 called [TikTok Series](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-a-new-way-for-creators-to-share-premium-content-with-series). This new feature is a way to create exclusive content that lives behind a paywall.

Interested creators can apply to get access to this new feature, but there are other criteria they need to meet as well:

* Creators must be 18+
* Their account must be at least 30 days old
* They must have at least 10,000 followers
* They must have posted 3+ public videos in the last 30 days
* They must have at least 1,000 views in the last 30 days

Creators who have less than 10,000 followers may still be eligible if they can provide a link to premium content they’ve successfully sold on other platforms.

Your Series can include up to 80 videos total, each up to 20 minutes long. This can be a great way to provide valuable educational content to your audience for a one-time fee. You can set the price for each TikTok Series you create, with payment options ranging from $0.99 to $189.99.

# 11. Provide virtual gifts

Another monetization feature is virtual gifts on your videos. People who really enjoy your content can send you virtual gifts as a token of their appreciation—which can then be converted into actual money.

Turn on the gift option to have a small gift box icon appear next to the comment box. Users interested in leaving a gift can tap it to visit this interface:

https://preview.redd.it/dm72wcc6v1je1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef82060cccdf8e48390f23e6673620987aeb9ffa

Coin packages can be bought in the following increments:

* 20 coins: $0.29
* 65 coins: $0.99
* 330 coins: $4.99
* 660 coins: $9.99
* 1,321 coins: $19.99
* 3,303 coins: $49.99
* 6,607 coins: $99.99
* 16,500 coins: $249.99

These coins can then be used to buy and send virtual gifts to a user’s favorite creators, with gifts ranging from 5 to 3,000 coins. Turn on virtual gifts to offer this option to your viewers.

# 12. Host live events or workshops

TikTok Live is another great way to make money. Similar to virtual video gifts, users can also send live gifts. The little gift box icon will appear at the bottom of a live video for users to tap and buy different gifts. The ranges on these are even bigger, with some being just a single coin and others going up to 10s of thousands of coins.

Several TikTok creators have shared how live streaming can be used to make money. One creator makes between $20-$300 every time they go live and another brought in $34,000 within a single month—just from live streaming.

Make sure your live videos are entertaining and valuable so that users keep wanting to tune in. The more consistent viewers you get, the more likely they are to stick around and send you virtual gifts.

# 13. Offer personalized shoutouts

If you have a large following, TikTokers who want to grow their accounts may be willing to pay for personalized shoutouts. Pick a price point and sell shoutouts as yet another way to make money. Your price may be a bit of trial and error. If you’re getting no bites, you may want to lower it. But on the other hand, if you’re getting a ton of interest, you might be able to increase your price.

You can then shout these people out during a live video or during a feed video. You might even choose to offer two different price points (with feed videos costing more) so that users can choose where they’d like to be shouted out.

# 14. Sell digital products

Finally, consider selling digital products. You can create a shop with TikTok and link to your digital products from there, making it easy to make a sale. Promote your products within your videos and include your shop’s URL in your profile so users can easily find it.

Merchandise, merchandise, merchandise. This tried-and-true strategy applies to TikTok as well. Turn original artwork, quotes or your brand’s logo into merch and promote it on TikTok. Feature your existing products in tutorials or showcase your product alongside a trend.

# 9. Set up a TikTok shop

TikTok partnered with Shopify to launch the [TikTok Shopping](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-ways-to-discover-and-shop-on-tiktok) feature. Brands and creators can become official TikTok merchants and sell directly in the app.

By creating a TikTok Shop, you can showcase products on in-feed videos, lives and product showcase tabs. If [eligible](https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10000749) for this feature, you can signup to become a seller in the [TikTok Seller Center](https://seller.tiktok.com/), where you can manage inventory, orders, creator partnerships, promotions and more. However, the seller center is only available in select regions.

# 10. Offer exclusive content on TikTok

TikTok just launched a new monetization feature in June of 2023 called [TikTok Series](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-a-new-way-for-creators-to-share-premium-content-with-series). This new feature is a way to create exclusive content that lives behind a paywall.

Interested creators can apply to get access to this new feature, but there are other criteria they need to meet as well:

* Creators must be 18+
* Their account must be at least 30 days old
* They must have at least 10,000 followers
* They must have posted 3+ public videos in the last 30 days
* They must have at least 1,000 views in the last 30 days

Creators who have less than 10,000 followers may still be eligible if they can provide a link to premium content they’ve successfully sold on other platforms.

Your Series can include up to 80 videos total, each up to 20 minutes long. This can be a great way to provide valuable educational content to your audience for a one-time fee. You can set the price for each TikTok Series you create, with payment options ranging from $0.99 to $189.99.

# 11. Provide virtual gifts

Another monetization feature is virtual gifts on your videos. People who really enjoy your content can send you virtual gifts as a token of their appreciation—which can then be converted into actual money.

Turn on the gift option to have a small gift box icon appear next to the comment box. Users interested in leaving a gift can tap it to visit this interface:

https://preview.redd.it/dm72wcc6v1je1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef82060cccdf8e48390f23e6673620987aeb9ffa

Coin packages can be bought in the following increments:

* 20 coins: $0.29
* 65 coins: $0.99
* 330 coins: $4.99
* 660 coins: $9.99
* 1,321 coins: $19.99
* 3,303 coins: $49.99
* 6,607 coins: $99.99
* 16,500 coins: $249.99

These coins can then be used to buy and send virtual gifts to a user’s favorite creators, with gifts ranging from 5 to 3,000 coins. Turn on virtual gifts to offer this option to your viewers.

# 12. Host live events or workshops

TikTok Live is another great way to make money. Similar to virtual video gifts, users can also send live gifts. The little gift box icon will appear at the bottom of a live video for users to tap and buy different gifts. The ranges on these are even bigger, with some being just a single coin and others going up to 10s of thousands of coins.

Several TikTok creators have shared how live streaming can be used to make money. One creator makes between $20-$300 every time they go live and another brought in $34,000 within a single month—just from live streaming.

Make sure your live videos are entertaining and valuable so that users keep wanting to tune in. The more consistent viewers you get, the more likely they are to stick around and send you virtual gifts.

# 13. Offer personalized shoutouts

If you have a large following, TikTokers who want to grow their accounts may be willing to pay for personalized shoutouts. Pick a price point and sell shoutouts as yet another way to make money. Your price may be a bit of trial and error. If you’re getting no bites, you may want to lower it. But on the other hand, if you’re getting a ton of interest, you might be able to increase your price.

You can then shout these people out during a live video or during a feed video. You might even choose to offer two different price points (with feed videos costing more) so that users can choose where they’d like to be shouted out.

# 14. Sell digital products

Finally, consider selling digital products. You can create a shop with TikTok and link to your digital products from there, making it easy to make a sale. Promote your products within your videos and include your shop’s URL in your profile so users can easily find it.

# 1. Join the TikTok Creativity Program/ Creator Fund

Since 2020 TikTok has offered its most popular creators a program to monetize content. In November 2023 TikTok announced some changes to how this works, depending on where you are located in the world. TikTok are shutting down the Creator Fund for users in the US, UK, Germany and France and replacing it with the [Creativity Program](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creativity-program-beta/) starting December 16th.

TikTok says the new fund will enable creators in these countries to make more money for video uploads over a minute. To join, users must have at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days. Earnings will also be based on views and other TikTok engagement metrics.

Are you a creator in Italy and Spain? Users in these countries can still monetize their profiles through the TikTok Creator Fund. Creators need to hit some prerequisites to join the program and begin receiving money from the platform. Creator Fund members earn money based on the number of engagements they get on their content.

**2. Run TikTok ads**  
About 67% of 18-19 year olds and 56% of 20-29 year olds are on TikTok. This makes TikTok marketing a strong advertising choice for brands wanting to market their products to Gen Z. TikTok ads come with simple, powerful tools to help you advertise to millions of users. Ad formats vary by region, but all let you personalize your targeting by age, location, interest and other factors. You can select one or a few formats that work best for your brand.

The most popular types of TikTok ads include:

**In-feed video:** Appear on the For You Page of TikTok users who meet your targeting parameters.

**Brand takeover:** This lets your ad expand to the width of the whole screen for a few seconds. Then it becomes an in-feed video ad.

**Hashtag challenges**: Create appealing challenges that encourage user-generated content. These challenges appear in the Discovery section on TikTok. This option is only available to managed brands that work in collaboration with TikTok sales representatives.

There are several more types of TikTok ads you can experiment with, but note that some are only available to certain types of accounts.

**3. Collect tips or donations**  
TikTok has introduced a tipping feature that allows select creators to earn money from tips and donations. Fans can use this feature to show gratitude to the creators they love.

Video gifts let viewers send creators virtual gifts and coins. Some creators can collect gifts during a live stream. Gifts can be redeemed for Diamonds—TikTok’s digital currency.

When you save up enough Diamonds, you can trade them for real cash.

Creators can also use tipping platforms to earn money. Tipeee, Ko-fi and Buy Me a Coffee can be connected to your TikTok account to function as a tip jar.

**4. Collaborate with a creator**  
To generate revenue on TikTok, leveraging existing popular creators is undoubtedly a strategic shortcut. These creators on TikTok boast a vast fan base and highly engaged communities, and collaborating with them can swiftly elevate the visibility and influence of a brand or product. However, establishing contact with these popular creators and reaching a collaboration agreement is not an easy task.

# 5. Try affiliate marketing

Through affiliate marketing programs, creators and other businesses can promote and sell another company’s products or services for a commission.

To be a successful affiliate marketer, you need to generate sales online. Focus on promoting products that best align with your target audience. Create engaging videos that present affiliate products, showcasing the value and why you recommend purchasing them. Try promoting brands you like and trust, sharing affiliate links or codes to track purchases influenced by your account.

If you’re an in-house marketer, create an affiliate marketing program with clear guidelines and instructions on how to participate. Invite TikTokers who align with your brand values and target audience to participate. Encourage affiliates to promote the products or services that best align with your goals and shared audience. And most importantly, implement a tracking system so you can monitor affiliate performance and commission payments.

# 6. Grow and sell TikTok accounts

Organically growing a TikTok account could take months. However, you can buy an established account to get an instant boost of followers.

To successfully make money selling TikTok accounts, creators should focus on niche topics that can be sustained by the buyer. This will make it easier for the buyer to continue posting similar content and maintain follower engagement.

Brands considering buying an established account should perform due diligence. An account with a lot of followers but low engagement may not provide the return you’re looking for. Also, ensure the account serves an audience you target and the content aligns with your brand and goals.

# 7. Publish sponsored posts

For smaller activations, brands can sponsor posts that live directly on creators’ profiles. Similar to creator collaborations, these campaigns allow brands to pay content creators to promote their products in organic posts. Sponsor single posts or create a series. If it starts trending, you can boost the post to expand its reach even further.

# 8. Sell your products and merchandise

Merchandise, merchandise, merchandise. This tried-and-true strategy applies to TikTok as well. Turn original artwork, quotes or your brand’s logo into merch and promote it on TikTok. Feature your existing products in tutorials or showcase your product alongside a trend.

Prostate troubles aren’t just an inconvenience. Waking up five times a night isn’t fun, and let’s be honest—no guy wants to map out public restrooms every time he leaves the house.

If you’re tired of the discomfort and looking for **natural supplements for prostate health**, you’ve probably come across [Fluxactive Complete](https://theworldhealth.org/fluxactive-official).

# Product Overview

* **Product Name: Fluxactive**
* **Category: Natural Prostate Care**
* **Overall Verdict: 4.4/5**

# Key Ingredients & Benefits

The secret to **Fluxactive Complete’s effectiveness** is its **14-ingredient blend** that supports **prostate health, urinary function, and male vitality**. Let's break it down.

✔ **Chinese Ginseng benefits for male fertility** – This herb isn't just for energy. Some studies suggest it may **support reproductive health and testosterone balance**, making it a double win for men looking beyond just prostate care.

🌿

✔ **Saw Palmetto and prostate support** – A staple in **herbal remedies for enlarged prostate**, this plant is known for **reducing inflammation and promoting easier urination**.

🌿

✔ **Ginkgo Biloba effects on male reproductive system** – While mostly known for memory support, **Ginkgo Biloba** also **improves circulation**, which could benefit **prostate and reproductive health**.

🌿

✔ **Damiana and male reproductive health** – Traditionally used to **enhance stamina and hormone regulation**, Damiana may contribute to an **overall feeling of well-being**.

🌿

✔ **Inosine benefits for men's vitality** – This compound plays a role in **cellular energy production**, which could explain why some users report **improved stamina and energy levels**.

🌿

✔ **Cayenne pepper and prostate function** – Cayenne isn't just for spice; it’s packed with **antioxidant benefits for prostate health**, helping to **combat oxidative stress**.

🌿

✔ **Vitamin E’s role in prostate health** – An essential nutrient, **Vitamin E** supports **cell repair and inflammation reduction**, key factors in **long-term prostate function**.

🌿

With this **powerful blend**, Fluxactive aims to [support bladder function](https://theworldhealth.org/fluxactive-official) **while promoting overall prostate health**. But does it actually do what it claims?

# How Effective Is Fluxactive Complete?

A supplement is only as good as the results people get from it. Based on research and **Fluxactive Complete customer testimonials**, there’s plenty of positive feedback.

Many men report **improved urinary flow**, fewer midnight wake-ups, and an overall **better quality of life**. Some users also noted a **mild energy boost**, likely from the **Chinese Ginseng and Inosine**.

However, patience is key—**Fluxactive Complete isn’t an instant fix**. A few users found it took **several weeks to show noticeable results**, especially for those with more advanced symptoms.

# Bryan’s Experience With Fluxactive Complete

Bryan, my middle-aged neighbor and self-proclaimed **golf addict**, doesn’t usually fuss over supplements—unless they interfere with his time on the green.

So, when he mentioned his **frequent bathroom trips were cutting into his game**, [I told him about Fluxactive Complete](https://theworldhealth.org/fluxactive-official).

After about **three weeks**, Bryan started noticing **fewer mid-game interruptions** (his words: “Finally, I can focus on my swing instead of scouting the nearest restroom”).

He also mentioned feeling **a bit more energized**, which he chalked up to **Chinese Ginseng and Inosine** working in the background.

That said, he did have one small gripe: **“These capsules are kinda big,”** he grumbled one morning over coffee. While they didn’t **bother him too much**, he thought it was **worth mentioning for guys who struggle with pills**.

All in all, Bryan was **pretty satisfied** with his experience. He’s still taking **Fluxactive Complete** daily and, more importantly, he’s back to **playing 18 holes without unnecessary detours**.

His final verdict? **“It’s working, and my golf buddies have noticed. Now they’re asking what I’m taking.”**

He adjusted the camera lens, focusing on the nude model, a statuesque blonde named Anya, draped across a velvet chaise lounge. He gave her a professional nod and clicked the shutter. *Click. Click. Click.* He was good at his job, damn good. He knew Jess hated it, though. He pictured her outside in the car, probably scrolling through Instagram, a frown creasing her brow. He always assumed it was insecurity, but he was a loyal man. And the money was good, really good. It afforded them a comfortable life, a life Jess seemed less and less appreciative of these days. He thought back to their early days, their whirlwind romance in photography class. He’d been captivated by her fiery spirit, her infectious laughter. She’d seen something in him too, a quiet intensity, a shared artistic passion. They were inseparable then, two halves of a whole.

""That's a wrap, Anya,"" Joshua announced, lowering his camera. Anya smiled, a practiced, professional smile, and quickly wrapped herself in a silk robe. Joshua exchanged polite goodbyes with the studio staff, his mind already on Jess. He was actually excited to see her. He still loved her, even if things had been strained lately. He clung to the hope that they could recapture the spark they once shared. He exited the studio and spotted her car, a sleek, black SUV, parked a little further down the street than usual. He walked towards it, a knot tightening in his stomach. Something felt off. He couldn't place it, but it was there. Jess was inside, slumped against the headrest, her eyes closed. She didn't acknowledge him as he got in.

""Hey,"" he said, leaning in for a kiss. Jess turned her head slightly, offering a perfunctory peck on the cheek. ""Long day?""

""You could say that,"" she replied, her voice flat.

The drive home was silent, an uncomfortable silence that stretched on and on. Joshua kept glancing at Jess, trying to decipher the shift in her demeanor. She seemed distant, preoccupied. Finally, he couldn't take it anymore.

""Jess, what's wrong?""

She sighed, a long, drawn-out sigh. ""Joshua,"" she began, her voice trembling slightly, ""I don't think this is working anymore.""

His heart pounded in his chest. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm not happy,"" she said, her eyes welling up with tears. ""I haven't been happy for a long time.""

He felt a surge of anger, mixed with a deep, aching sadness. ""Is this about my job? Because you know I do this for us.""

""It's not just your job, Joshua. It's… it's everything. We're not the same people we were when we got married.""

""So, what, you're just giving up? After all this time?""

Jess took a deep breath. ""I've been seeing someone else,"" she confessed, her voice barely a whisper.

The world seemed to tilt on its axis. ""Seeing someone else?"" he repeated, the words hollow. ""You asked for an open relationship, remember? I said no.""

""That was different,"" she retorted, her voice rising. ""That was about *you* wanting to sleep with other people. This is about… about connection. Something I don't feel with you anymore.""

He stared at her, speechless. The anger was gone now, replaced by a crushing wave of despair. ""So, that's it? You're just… leaving?""

Jess nodded, tears streaming down her face. ""I'm moving out,"" she said. ""I've already found a place.""

Joshua watched as Jess pulled out of the driveway, the taillights of her SUV disappearing into the night. He sat there for a long time, the silence broken only by the sound of his own ragged breathing. The knot in his stomach had unraveled, leaving a gaping hole in its place. He felt empty, hollowed out. He couldn't bring himself to move. He just sat there, in the darkness, as the weight of his broken marriage crashed down on him.

The house was silent, suffocatingly so. Joshua wandered through the rooms, each one a testament to a life now shattered. He sank onto the living room couch, the cushions still bearing the faint imprint of Jess's body. He fumbled for his cigarettes, the familiar ritual a small comfort in this unfamiliar territory. He lit one, the cherry glowing in the dim light, and inhaled deeply. Music drifted from the speakers, a playlist he and Jess used to enjoy. Now, each note was a sharp pang of loss, a reminder of shared moments now tainted with bitterness.

He needed to talk, to hear a voice other than the ones echoing in his head. He scrolled through his contacts, his finger hovering over Tristan's name. Tristan, his old college buddy, the life of the party, always ready with a joke and a listening ear. He hadn't spoken to him in years, caught up in the whirlwind of his career and his marriage. He hesitated, a wave of self-pity washing over him. Who was he to burden Tristan with his problems? But the silence was unbearable, a crushing weight on his chest. He pressed the call button.

""Josh! It's been years, man! Holy smokes, bro!"" Tristan's voice boomed through the speaker, a blast of unexpected cheerfulness. Joshua felt a flicker of warmth, a momentary reprieve from the darkness.

""Hey, Tristan,"" he mumbled, his voice thick with emotion.

They exchanged pleasantries, catching up on years of missed moments. Tristan, ever the optimist, painted a picture of his life, filled with adventures and successes. Joshua listened, a hollow ache in his chest. He couldn't muster the energy to reciprocate, to pretend that his world wasn't crumbling around him.

""So,"" Tristan said, his voice dropping slightly, ""how's Jess?""

The question was like a punch to the gut. ""She's gone,"" Joshua said, the words catching in his throat.

""Gone? What do you mean?""

""She left. Said she wasn't happy. Found someone else.""

A stunned silence followed. Then, Tristan's voice, filled with concern, ""Josh, I'm so sorry, man. But you know what? Screw her. She doesn't deserve you.""

""I guess I wasn't good enough,"" Joshua said, the words heavy with self-blame. He started to analyze their relationship, seeing it through Jess's eyes. He saw his own shortcomings, his preoccupation with work, his inability to truly see her needs. He saw the resentment building, the spark fading. He saw his own role in their demise.

""Don't you dare blame yourself,"" Tristan interrupted, his voice firm. ""You're a good man, Josh. Loyal, hardworking, kind. She's the one who threw it all away.""

""But maybe she was right,"" Joshua argued, his voice cracking. ""Maybe I wasn't what she needed. Maybe I was too focused on my career, on providing for us, that I forgot about… about us.""

""Listen,"" Tristan said, his voice softening, ""you can't blame yourself for her choices. You gave her a good life, you were faithful, you loved her. Sometimes, people just… drift apart. It doesn't mean you're not worthy of love, Josh. It just means you haven't found the right person yet.""

Joshua closed his eyes, the image of Jess's tear-stained face flashing before him. He felt a surge of anger, a bitter taste in his mouth. But underneath it all, there was a deeper pain, a sense of loss that threatened to consume him.

""I don't know what to do,"" he whispered, his voice raw with emotion.

""Just breathe, man,"" Tristan said. ""Take it one day at a time. Lean on your friends, let us be there for you. And remember, you deserve to be happy. Don't let her take that away from you.""

Joshua hung up the phone, Tristan's words echoing in his mind. He took another drag of his cigarette, the smoke swirling around him like the chaotic thoughts in his head. He was lost, adrift in a sea of despair. But somewhere deep down, a tiny ember of hope flickered. Maybe Tristan was right. Maybe this wasn't the end. Maybe it was just the beginning of something new.

Tristan's words were a lifeline, a reminder of a time when life was simpler, wilder, and filled with the reckless abandon of youth. They'd been inseparable since grade school, partners in crime, always pushing the boundaries and testing the limits. Their teenage years were a blur of legendary parties, impromptu road trips, and close calls that still made them laugh, even years later.

There was the time they'd ""borrowed"" Tristan's older brother's car for a joyride, ending up stranded in a cornfield after a failed attempt to jump a ditch. Or the infamous New Year's Eve party where they'd rigged the sprinkler system to spray champagne, resulting in a chaotic, bubbly free-for-all. And who could forget the ill-fated camping trip where they'd accidentally set fire to their tent while attempting to cook a gourmet meal over an open flame?

They'd shared it all, the triumphs and the mishaps, the laughter and the tears. They were more than just friends; they were brothers, bound by a shared history and an unspoken understanding.

But as they grew older, their paths diverged. Joshua found stability in his marriage and his career, while Tristan continued to embrace the unpredictable, chasing adventure and pushing the boundaries of convention. Joshua had watched from afar, a mixture of admiration and trepidation. He envied Tristan's freedom, his carefree spirit, but he also feared it. He'd seen firsthand the dark side of recklessness, the potential for self-destruction that lurked beneath the surface.

He'd had his own brushes with excess, experimenting with drugs and alcohol in his younger years. He'd managed to pull back from the brink, finding solace in Jess and his photography. But the memories lingered, a shadow of doubt that haunted him. He worried that reconnecting with Tristan would reawaken those dormant demons, that he would be pulled back into a world he'd worked so hard to escape.

He knew he needed Tristan's support now, more than ever. But he also knew the risks. He was walking a tightrope, balancing his need for connection with his fear of losing everything he'd built.

Joshua stared at the ceiling, the shadows dancing in the dim light. He couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness, the hollowness that Jess had left behind. He needed to get out of the house, to escape the memories that clung to every corner. He picked up his phone and dialed Tristan's number.

""Hey, you busy?"" Joshua asked, his voice still heavy with sadness.

""Nah, just chilling,"" Tristan replied. ""What's up?""

""I need to get out of here,"" Joshua said. ""Want to grab a drink?""

""Absolutely,"" Tristan said. ""I know just the place. It's got great music, cheap drinks, and plenty of… distractions.""

They met at the bar, a dimly lit, lively spot with a mix of music and chatter filling the air. Tristan, ever the extrovert, was already working the room, charming the bartender and making friends with a group of women at the next table. Joshua, still feeling the weight of his recent heartbreak, was more reserved, observing the scene with a mix of amusement and apprehension.

As the night wore on, the alcohol flowed, the music pulsed, and the conversation grew louder. Tristan, fueled by his usual exuberance and a few too many shots, was in his element, regaling the women with outlandish stories and hilarious impersonations. Joshua, despite his initial reluctance, found himself drawn into the energy of the room, laughing at Tristan's antics and enjoying the company of the women.

At one point, Tristan, in a moment of playful mischief, challenged Joshua to a dance-off. Joshua, surprised by the sudden challenge, hesitated for a moment before accepting, a grin spreading across his face. They took to the dance floor, two friends letting loose, their bodies moving to the rhythm of the music, their laughter echoing through the bar.

The night was a blur of music, laughter, and conversation. As the bar began to empty, Joshua and Tristan found themselves chatting with two women, their conversation flowing easily, their connection growing stronger. The women were witty, intelligent, and just as fun-loving as Joshua and Tristan.

The laughter faded, the music died down, and the warmth of the bar gave way to the cold, harsh light of reality. Joshua had sought solace, a brief respite from the pain, but the world wasn't done with him. The whispers started again, louder now, more insistent, weaving their way into his thoughts, twisting his memories, reshaping his very being. He hadn't expected the world to turn against him, to conspire to break him down, to mold him into something unrecognizable, something no human could fathom. He didn't know it yet, but the transformation had begun. The cracks were widening, the darkness seeping in, and Joshua Carpenter was slowly becoming a monster.

The silence was a suffocating blanket, broken only by the frantic thump-thump-thump of Joshua's heart against his ribs. He lay rigid in bed, eyes wide, staring into the oppressive darkness. It wasn't the absence of sound that chilled him, it was the *presence* of something else, something just beyond the threshold of hearing. Then, a whisper, like a breath against his ear, slithered into his consciousness. *Joshua…* it hissed, a distorted, malicious echo of his own name. He was alone, utterly alone, yet the feeling of being watched, scrutinized, judged, was visceral, suffocating. He wasn't sure if he was hearing it or feeling it, but the whispers were there, weaving themselves into the fabric of his sanity.

He bolted upright, heart hammering against his ribs, and stumbled towards the bathroom. The fluorescent light flickered to life, casting a sickly glow on his reflection. He stared at his own image, searching for something, anything, that would explain the gnawing unease that had taken root in his soul. His eyes seemed darker, more hollow, and a faint tremor twitched at the corner of his mouth. A new mark, like a faint bruise, marred his arm, but it was gone in the next instant, or so he thought. He felt a creeping dread, the sense of something unseen, something monstrous, growing inside of him.

He stumbled back to bed, sleep now a distant memory. He closed his eyes, and a kaleidoscope of disturbing images flashed behind his eyelids. He was trapped in a labyrinth of whispers, pursued by shadowy figures with accusing eyes. They hurled accusations at him, each word a poisoned dart piercing his flesh. His skin crawled, his body felt heavy, distorted, like it was no longer his own. He woke with a gasp, drenched in a cold sweat, the lingering terror of the dream clinging to him like a shroud. The whispers followed him into wakefulness, their voices growing louder, more insistent, weaving their way into his thoughts, twisting his memories, reshaping his very being.

He stumbled out of bed, driven by a desperate need to escape the whispers, to find some semblance of sanity. He wandered through the silent house, each room a stark reminder of what he had lost. He paused in the living room, drawn to a framed photo of Jess, her smiling face a cruel mockery of his present misery. He picked it up, his fingers tracing the outline of her face, a wave of longing crashing over him. Then, he saw it. A flicker of something in her eyes, a hint of malice that he had never noticed before. He blinked, and it was gone, but the seed of doubt had been planted. Had she always been this way? Had he been blind to the darkness lurking beneath the surface?

As he stood there, lost in a labyrinth of doubt and fear, a chill ran down his spine. He wasn't sure if it was the coldness of the room or something else, something far more sinister. He felt a presence, a malevolent force closing in on him, whispering promises of power and revenge.  The whispers had found their host.

The whispers became a chorus, a cacophony of voices swirling inside his head, each one a shard of doubt, fear, and accusation. They clawed at his sanity, tearing at the fragile fabric of his reality. He clutched his head, trying to silence the voices, but they only grew louder, more insistent.

""Shut up! Shut up! SHUT UP!"" he screamed, his voice raw with desperation.

The photo of Jess slipped from his grasp, shattering against the hardwood floor. He sank to his knees, the broken glass a mirror reflecting his own fractured state.

""Jess!"" he cried, his voice breaking. ""Why? Why did you leave me?""

He lashed out, his fists pounding against the floor, the walls, the furniture. He overturned a coffee table, sending books and magazines scattering across the room. He ripped the curtains from the windows, letting the cold night air flood in. He grabbed a lamp and hurled it against the wall, the shattering glass echoing his own internal chaos.

He was spiraling, losing control, consumed by a grief so profound it threatened to swallow him whole. He sobbed uncontrollably, his body wracked with tremors. He crawled across the floor, the broken glass cutting into his skin, a physical manifestation of his emotional pain. He reached the hallway mirror and slammed his fist against it, the glass cracking and splintering. He saw his reflection, distorted and grotesque, a stranger staring back at him with wild, desperate eyes.

""Why!?"" he screamed at his reflection, his voice cracking with anguish. ""Why did you leave me!?""

Suddenly, a sharp knock on the door startled him. He froze, his breath catching in his throat. The knocking grew louder, more insistent. He stumbled to his feet, his body trembling, his mind racing. He cautiously approached the door, his heart pounding in his chest.

""Who is it?"" he croaked, his voice barely a whisper.

""Police,"" a gruff voice responded. ""Open up.""

He fumbled with the lock, his hands shaking. He opened the door a crack, his eyes widening in surprise. Two uniformed officers stood on his porch, their expressions a mixture of concern and suspicion.

""We received a noise complaint,"" one of the officers said. ""Someone reported hearing screaming.""

Joshua stared at them, his mind reeling. ""Screaming?"" he repeated, his voice hoarse.

""Yes,"" the other officer said, his eyes narrowing. ""A woman screaming.""

Joshua's blood ran cold. ""A woman?"" he whispered, his voice barely audible.

The officers exchanged a look. ""That's right,"" the first officer said. ""Are you alone here, sir?""

Joshua nodded slowly, his mind racing. He couldn't comprehend what they were saying. He had been screaming, yes, but he was a man. He looked down at his hands, his body, searching for an explanation, a sign of the transformation he was undergoing.

""Sir, are you alright?"" the second officer asked, his voice laced with concern.

Joshua looked up at them, his eyes wide with fear and confusion. ""I don't know,"" he whispered, his voice trembling. ""I don't know what's happening to me.""

""Sir, we need to come in and make sure everything is alright,"" the first officer insisted, his hand hovering near his taser. ""It's standard procedure.""

Joshua, still reeling from the revelation about the woman's screams, felt a surge of defiance. ""Don't you need a warrant for that?"" he mumbled, the words tasting like ash in his mouth.

The second officer stepped closer, his gaze unwavering. ""Look, sir, we're just trying to do our job. If you have nothing to hide, you'll let us in.""

He knew they didn't trust him, saw him as a potential threat. The accusation hung heavy in the air, a woman screaming, a woman he hadn't even been with. He felt a surge of anger, a primal urge to lash out, to defend himself against this invisible accuser. But the exhaustion, the emotional turmoil, had drained him. He simply nodded, stepping aside to let them in.

""Wait out here,"" the first officer instructed, gesturing towards the porch. ""Have a cigarette or something.""

Joshua numbly obeyed, lighting another cigarette with trembling hands. He watched as the officers disappeared into his house, their flashlights cutting through the darkness. He felt a strange detachment, like he was watching a scene unfold in a movie, a scene in which he was both the protagonist and the villain. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, that the world was tilting on its axis, and he was powerless to stop it.

The officers emerged a few minutes later, their faces grim. ""Everything seems to be in order, sir,"" the first officer said, his voice laced with suspicion. ""But we'll be keeping an eye on this place.""

They left, their cruiser's taillights disappearing into the night. Joshua stood on the porch, the cigarette burning a hole in his fingers. He felt a strange mix of relief and dread. Relief that the immediate confrontation was over, dread at the implications of the officers' words, the lingering suspicion in their eyes. And the woman's screams... who had screamed? He hadn't been with anyone. Tristan had, but he was already home, wasn't he?

He went back inside, the silence now amplified by the echo of the officers' footsteps. He began to clean up the mess, the shattered glass, the overturned furniture, the remnants of his breakdown. He turned on the TV, the mindless chatter a distraction from the turmoil in his mind. He flipped through the channels, landing on the local news. A headline flashed across the screen: ""Two Women Missing After Night Out.""

His heart skipped a beat. He turned up the volume, his eyes glued to the screen. The news anchor, her voice somber, reported that two women had been reported missing after a night out at a local bar. They had been seen with two men, but their identities were unknown. The police were asking for anyone with information to come forward.

Joshua's blood ran cold. He recognized the bar, the one he and Tristan had been at. He remembered the two women, their laughter, their easy conversation. He fumbled for his phone, his hands shaking. He dialed Tristan's number, the ringing tone echoing in the silence. It went straight to voicemail. He tried again, and again, but there was no answer. Panic clawed at his throat, a cold dread seeping into his bones. He was caught in a nightmare, a horrifying reality that was rapidly spiraling out of control.

The news report replayed in Joshua’s mind, the faces of the missing women flashing before his eyes. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was connected to it somehow, that the night at the bar had unleashed something dark and terrible within him. He felt a strange unease in his gut, a twisting sensation that was more than just anxiety. He dismissed it as stress, the lingering effects of the breakup, the police, the news. But the feeling persisted, growing stronger, more insistent.

He went to the bathroom, hoping a cold shower would clear his head. As he undressed, he caught his reflection in the mirror. His skin seemed… different. A faint discoloration, like a bruise spreading across his abdomen. He touched it gingerly, and a sharp pain shot through him. It wasn’t just a bruise. It was something… else.

He leaned closer, his breath catching in his throat. The discoloration was spreading, a sickly purple hue creeping across his skin. And beneath the surface, something was moving. A slow, undulating movement, like something was trying to push its way out. He pressed harder, his fingers sinking into the soft flesh of his stomach. The pain was excruciating, a searing heat that made him gasp.

Suddenly, a memory surfaced, unbidden, from the depths of his past. He was a child, watching in horror as his mother clutched her stomach, her face contorted in agony. The same sickening purple bruising, the same unnatural swelling. Prolapsed stomach, the doctor had called it. He remembered the fear, the confusion, the image of his mother being rushed away in an ambulance. And then, the silence.

He stumbled back from the mirror, his heart pounding in his chest. He felt a wave of nausea, a primal fear gripping him. This wasn’t just a bad dream. This was real. The transformation was happening.

Then, a voice, cold and sharp, echoed in his mind. “He threw me down the stairs.”

The memory intensified, flooding his senses. He saw his mother again, falling, her body crashing against the hard floor. He heard her screams, her cries for help. And then, another voice, a child’s wail, filled with terror and pain. “He killed our baby!”

The pain in his stomach intensified, a searing, tearing sensation. He doubled over, clutching his abdomen, his body convulsing. He collapsed to the floor, the whispers and cries swirling around him, a chorus of torment echoing in his mind. He was changing, becoming something monstrous, something he didn’t recognize. And the voices, the memories, were just the beginning.

The pain was beyond anything Joshua had ever imagined. It felt like something was alive inside him, a parasitic entity writhing and gnawing its way up his body, tearing through muscle and sinew. He tried to scream, but his voice was trapped, choked by the terror and the agony. He felt his body contorting, his muscles spasming violently, his bones audibly cracking and shifting. He was a prisoner in his own flesh, forced to endure this horrific metamorphosis, his consciousness a front-row seat to his own gruesome undoing.

The pressure built, a crushing, sickening force that threatened to rupture him from the inside out. He could feel something moving, slick and wet, slithering upwards like a serpent. Then, it happened. Something burst forth, not from his stomach as he expected, but from his mouth. It wasn't a scream, not a human sound. It was something guttural, demonic, a screech that tore through the silence of the house, a sound that could curdle blood and freeze the heart. It was the sound of something inhuman being violently birthed, a raw, visceral expulsion of something utterly alien. He tasted blood and bile, the coppery tang of his own terror.

And then, mercifully, everything went black.  

He surfaced from the blackness, gasping for air, his body slick with sweat and something else… something viscous and metallic. He was in a nightmare, a swirling vortex of whispers and accusations. Tristan’s voice, usually a source of comfort, echoed through the darkness, twisted and malicious. “Josh? Man, that guy’s a total creep. Remember that time he…?” The lies were outlandish, absurd, yet they burrowed into Joshua’s mind, planting seeds of doubt and self-loathing. Then, Jess’s voice, cold and distant, joined the chorus. “He’s always been weird. I heard he…”. The rumors were more personal, more intimate, laced with betrayal. They painted him as a monster, a predator, a man capable of unspeakable acts. He couldn’t see them, Tristan and Jess, but their voices were omnipresent, a suffocating blanket of lies.

He fought to open his eyes, to escape the torment of their voices. Finally, his eyelids flickered open. He wasn't in his bed. He wasn't even in his house. He was in a room bathed in a sickening red light, the source of which he couldn't discern. The air was thick with a cloying, coppery smell that made his stomach churn. He looked down at his hands. They were covered in blood, not his own, he instinctively knew. He was naked, his body smeared with the same crimson substance.

His gaze drifted upwards, and his blood ran cold. Two figures stood before him, their forms silhouetted against the red glow. He recognized them. The women from the bar. They were… different. Their eyes were wide and vacant, dead white orbs that stared straight through him, yet somehow also seemed to see into the deepest, darkest corners of his soul. Their smiles were fixed, unnatural, a grotesque parody of human expression.

His stomach lurched. He looked lower, and a wave of nausea washed over him. Their abdomens had been crudely opened, the flesh ripped apart. Their wombs were empty, scooped clean. The organs, glistening and grotesque, lay scattered on the floor between them, a horrifying tableau of carnage. Yet, they did nothing. They simply stood there, smiling, their dead eyes locked on his, as if they were waiting for him to do something, to complete some unspeakable ritual. He was trapped in a tableau of horror, a scene so grotesque, so utterly inhuman, that his mind struggled to process it. The whispers intensified, now laced with triumph, as if they had orchestrated this nightmare, as if they had created this monster he had become.

The red room swam before his eyes, the grotesque tableau of the two women seared into his mind. He was trapped, paralyzed by a terror so profound it transcended fear. He tried to scream, but no sound escaped his throat. He tried to move, but his limbs were heavy, unresponsive. He was a prisoner in his own body, forced to witness this horrific spectacle.

Suddenly, a blinding flash of light pierced the darkness, snapping him back to reality. He blinked, his eyes struggling to adjust to the sudden brightness. He was in his bed, the familiar surroundings a stark contrast to the nightmarish scene he had just witnessed. The red room, the mutilated bodies, the dead white eyes – all gone, vanished like a phantom.

He was drenched in sweat, his heart pounding in his chest. He sat up, his body trembling, his mind reeling from the horror of the dream. He looked around the room, half expecting to see the two women standing there, their grotesque smiles mocking him. But there was nothing, only the familiar furniture, the soft glow of the bedside lamp.

He reached for his phone, his hand shaking. He saw several missed calls from Tristan. He quickly dialed the number, his heart pounding with a mixture of hope and dread.

""Tristan?"" he said, his voice hoarse.

""Josh? Dude, what's up? I tried calling you back earlier, but you didn't answer.""

""I was… I had a nightmare,"" Joshua said, his voice trembling. ""It was… horrible.""

""Whoa, easy there, man,"" Tristan said, his voice laced with concern. ""You alright?""

""I don't know,"" Joshua said, his voice cracking. ""I think… I think something's happening to me.""

""What do you mean?"" Tristan asked.

""I don't know,"" Joshua repeated, his mind racing. ""I had this dream, this horrible dream. And… and I think it was real.""

""Josh, it was just a dream,"" Tristan said, his voice soothing. ""You're just stressed out, man. It's been a rough couple of days.""

""No, it wasn't just a dream,"" Joshua insisted. ""I felt it, Tristan. I felt it happening to me.""

""Felt what happening?"" Tristan asked, his voice laced with confusion.

Joshua hesitated, unsure how to explain the horror he had experienced. ""I… I don't know,"" he stammered. ""I can't explain it.""

""Just take it easy, man,"" Tristan said. ""Get some rest. We'll talk about it tomorrow.""

""Yeah, alright,"" Joshua said, his voice barely a whisper.

He hung up the phone, his mind still reeling from the nightmare. He couldn't shake the feeling that it was more than just a dream, that it was a premonition, a glimpse into the dark transformation that was taking place within him. He was changing, becoming something monstrous, something he didn't recognize. And he was terrified.

The lingering dread of the nightmare clung to Joshua like a shroud. He woke up feeling exhausted, his body heavy, his mind clouded with disturbing images. He knew he couldn't go to work, not in this state. He needed time to process what had happened, to understand the strange transformation he was undergoing. He called his boss, Mr. Thompson, hoping to take a sick day.

""Thompson, it's Joshua,"" he said, his voice hoarse. ""I'm not feeling well. I don't think I can come in today.""

""Carpenter, this is really bad timing,"" Thompson said, his voice tight. ""We've got that big shoot today, the one with the cosmetics company. We're already short-staffed.""

""I know, I'm sorry,"" Joshua said, ""but I really don't feel up to it. I think I might be getting sick.""

""Well, you should have thought of that before,"" Thompson snapped. ""We're counting on you, Carpenter. You know how important this contract is.""

""I understand,"" Joshua said, ""but I really can't come in. I'm not feeling well at all.""

""Look, Carpenter,"" Thompson said, his voice hardening, ""I'm not going to force you to come in. But if you don't show up today, you can consider yourself fired.""

Joshua was taken aback. ""Fired? Just like that?""

""That's right,"" Thompson said. ""I've had enough of your excuses. You've been unreliable lately, always taking time off. I need someone who's going to be here, someone I can count on.""

""But I've always been a good worker,"" Joshua protested. ""I've never missed a shoot before.""

""That's not true,"" Thompson said. ""You missed that shoot last month, the one with the swimsuit models. You said you had a family emergency, but I later found out you were just hungover.""

""That was one time,"" Joshua said, his voice rising. ""And it wasn't a family emergency. It was a personal issue.""

""Whatever it was, it cost us money,"" Thompson said. ""And now, this. I'm done with you, Carpenter. You're fired.""

""You can't do this,"" Joshua said, his voice trembling with anger. ""You can't just fire me like that.""

""I can and I am,"" Thompson said. ""And don't bother coming back for your things. I'll have them sent to you.""

The line went dead. Joshua stared at the phone, his mind reeling. He couldn't believe what had just happened. He had been fired, just like that, without any warning. He felt a surge of anger, a burning resentment towards Thompson, towards the world, towards everything that had gone wrong in his life.

Then, a new thought crept into his mind, a dark suspicion that made his blood run cold. He remembered the two women from the bar, the ones who were now missing. He remembered the way Thompson had said he'd had enough of his excuses. He remembered the look in Thompson's eyes, a mixture of anger and disgust. He wondered if Thompson knew something, if he had heard something about what had happened at the bar. He wondered if the reason he was being fired was more than just a missed shoot. He wondered if it had something to do with the missing women, if someone had accused him of something… something foul. The thought made his stomach churn. Had one of the models said something? Accused him of something he didn't do? The whispers in his mind grew louder, more insistent, weaving a narrative of guilt and suspicion. He was being framed, he was sure of it. But by whom? And for what?

The phone slipped from Joshua's grasp, clattering to the floor. Fired. The word echoed in his mind, a death knell to any semblance of hope he still clung to. He was losing everything. His wife, his job, his sanity. The whispers intensified, feeding on his despair, painting him as a failure, a monster, a man deserving of nothing but pain. He felt a crushing weight on his chest, a suffocating despair that made it hard to breathe. What was the point anymore? He was alone, broken, and utterly lost.

He stumbled into the bathroom, his reflection in the cracked mirror a grotesque caricature of himself. His eyes were bloodshot, his face pale and gaunt. He looked like a stranger, a man he didn't recognize. He stared at his reflection, a wave of self-loathing washing over him. He couldn't do this anymore. He couldn't bear the pain, the whispers, the constant fear that he was losing his mind.

He reached into the medicine cabinet, his hand trembling. He pulled out a bottle of pills, his fingers fumbling with the child-proof cap. He stared at the pills in his palm, small and white, a promise of oblivion. He brought them to his lips, his eyes closing. He was ready to give up, to surrender to the darkness that was consuming him.

Suddenly, a searing pain ripped through his abdomen, doubling him over. He gasped, the pills scattering across the floor. It wasn't like the earlier pain, this was sharper, more intense, like something was tearing him apart from the inside. He clutched his stomach, his body convulsing. He felt something moving inside him, something alien and terrifying. It was like the nightmare, the feeling of something being birthed from within.

He stumbled back from the mirror, his eyes wide with terror. He looked down at his stomach, and a wave of nausea washed over him. The skin was distended, stretched taut, and beneath the surface, he could see something moving, writhing. It was a grotesque, pulsating mass, pushing against his flesh, trying to break free.

The pain was excruciating, a burning, tearing sensation that made him scream. He fell to his knees, his body wracked with spasms. He felt like he was being ripped apart from the inside out, the monster within him struggling to escape. He was trapped, a vessel for something inhuman, something that was slowly, violently, taking over his body, his mind, his very soul. The pills, the despair, the self-destruction – all forgotten in the face of this new, unimaginable horror. He was no longer in control. He was becoming something else, something terrifying, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.

The morning sun streamed through the gaps in the drawn curtains, casting long, distorted shadows across the living room floor. Tristan stood on Joshua's porch, knocking insistently. ""Josh? You in there, man?"" He'd been trying to reach Joshua all night, a growing unease gnawing at him. Josh hadn't answered his calls, and something about their last conversation, the sheer terror in Josh's voice, had Tristan worried sick. He pounded on the door again, his knuckles white. Silence.

""Josh, come on, man, open up!"" He rattled the doorknob, finding it locked. He hesitated, a bad feeling settling in his gut. ""Oh buddy,"" he muttered, ""I'm sorry for this one."" He stepped back, took a deep breath, and kicked the door with all his might. The wood splintered, the door crashing inward with a resounding bang.

Immediately, a piercing alarm shrieked through the house, startling Tristan. He hadn't expected that. He stumbled inside, the sight that greeted him making his blood run cold. It wasn't just messy. It was… a massacre. The walls, the floors, the furniture – everything was covered in blood. Thick, dark, crimson blood. It was splattered, smeared, tracked across the carpet in grotesque patterns. The air was heavy with the coppery scent of it, a sickeningly sweet odor that made his stomach churn.

""Josh! Josh, are you here?"" He called out, his voice trembling, his eyes darting around the room, searching for his friend. He stepped carefully through the carnage, his shoes crunching on shards of glass and… something else. He didn't want to think about what it was.

""Josh, answer me!"" He moved through the house, his heart pounding in his chest, each room a scene of unspeakable horror. He found the overturned coffee table, the shattered lamp, the broken mirror in the bathroom – all bathed in blood. He reached the bedroom door, his hand shaking as he pushed it open.

""WHAT THE FUCK!""

Tristan recoiled, his stomach lurching. He stumbled back, his hand flying to his mouth. He barely made it to the hallway before he vomited, the contents of his stomach heaving onto the blood-soaked carpet. The scene in the bedroom was beyond anything he could have imagined, a tableau of unimaginable gore. He couldn't bring himself to look again, but the image was seared into his brain, a nightmare made real. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that Joshua was gone. Not just gone from the house, but gone from this world, consumed by something dark and monstrous.

Tristan stumbled back, his stomach heaving. He couldn't bring himself to look into the bedroom again, the image of what he'd seen burned into his mind. But he had to. He had to know. He took a shaky breath and forced himself to turn back, his eyes scanning the room, searching for Joshua.

And then he saw him.",1,1739515413.0,u_Special-Half-8499,1,1.0,False

I’m a 30-year-old guy software developer from Asker/Oslo(Norway) who traded an *Asian summer* for *Norwegian snowstorms* (best decision ever). I moved here for work, but let’s be real—I mostly stayed for the skiing, hiking, and the *all-you-can-breathe fresh air buffet*.

Looking for a cool person to explore new places with, do fun activities, and hopefully build something meaningful—starting with friendship and letting it grow into something beautiful (like a sourdough starter, but with less stress).

A bit about me:

* Vegetarian 🌱.
* Not really into clubbing, but down for a glass of wine (or whatever fuels your existential crises) over dinner with friends.
* Love skiing—both cross-country and downhill (because why choose one when you can fall gracefully in multiple ways?).
* Used to play guitar, but it’s been in hibernation. If you love music, maybe we can wake it up together! 🎸
* Can cook! Which means you *might* get free food if you play your cards right.
* My Norwegian is *okish*, meaning I can order food, survive small talk, and probably make some awkward grammar mistakes.

If you’re up for fun adventures, good laughs, and possibly watching me attempt (and fail) to make perfectly round chapatis, hit me up!

Let’s go on a hike, ski trip, or just share embarrassing life stories over coffee. 🚀.

Also, it has been a while since I was in a relationship.

Lately, I have been studying and working at Mcdonalds for a living, and because I am so poor at the moment, I have no social life either.

Anyway, I know where this person works (at a coffee shop), and I was thinking about going to the place where they work to see if they are working and if they are, then order something and potentially ask them to lunch if they seem interested in conversation.

I've had 17 dates with women through OLD (Hinge and Bumble) during that time period. Usually drinks or a coffee - occasionally dinner if we've both been dying to try a new restaurant. Of those 17, I reached out to try and schedule a second date with 11 of them - 8 rejected me citing 'lack of romantic connection' and 3 ghosted.  
  
I should note that my two past relationships (1.5 and 3 years long respectively) were forged through school and kind of seamlessly transitioned from friends to FWBs to relationship. As a result, I've never really 'dated' all that much. Nonetheless, I'd say I'm fairly confident with women and generally socially adept. 

To be totally honest, this slew of rejection has got me feeling a little insecure. I'd say by most women's standards I'm a reasonable catch. I have a very good career, am in great shape, volunteer often, and have hobbies that I'm passionate about. Granted, I'm probably only average looks-wise and am 5'9 - but this isn't a barrier for other men so I'm hesitant to blame it on those factors.  
  
I've tried reflecting on my dates and the only common 'flaw' I can find is that I'm not great with escalating physically. Only one of these dates ended in a kiss and one ended in a ONS (not my usual style - this was one of the people who ghosted me). All in all, I'm not super comfortable with PDA in a public place with a relative stranger and I don't think that's an uncommon perspective.

I recently had what I felt like was a great date with a sweet girl a couple days ago - we went barhopping and had good conversation with lots of laughs for \~3.5 hours. I suggested grabbing dinner next week and she got back to me saying I was 'awesome' and a 'great guy' but not a romantic connection - which is very similar to my prior dates. 

My intuition is that it would be super weird to ask for more feedback. However, at this point, I'm scared that I'm doing something terribly wrong / secretly have awful breath / am actually painfully unfunny / what have you. Thoughts? 

Does anyone have any further feedback or advice?",4,1739515137.0,dating_advice,7,0.83,False

Just wondering if anyone can relate.

I’m a 36year old FTM with a beautiful baby. I’ve had anxiety since before getting pregnant. I never stopped taking my meds. Wondering if my experience is PPD or not.

I went back to work five months ago, and it feels like the same work responsibilities got harder, or my brain can’t process as fast. I have a husband, and I can’t figure out why he doesn’t regularly take the initiative to do basic household chores despite our having many conversations about this. When I go home, I’m the one preparing solid food for the baby, getting dinner on the table (unless I come down with some illness), and doing the dishes after. I fold laundry that’s been sitting on the couch for days. Granted, so does he, but he only takes up his laundry - while i would take up both of ours and the baby’s. To be fair, he feeds the baby, he shops for groceries, he puts the clothes in the washer and dryer. He changes diapers and plays with the baby. I see this while I’m in the kitchen washing yet another round of dishes or trying to get food on the table. Every morning, I take the time to make us both coffee, and every evening, I’m the one emptying the filter and doing the whole thing again the next morning. Maybe this is a typical division of labor in a household, but it seems never-ending. I try to tell myself these are small things, and that we are a team. Maybe I do 80% today, and he does 20%. Maybe he does 80% one day whereas I may do 20%, but we’re both giving 100% to our baby at the end of the day. I consider myself a strong person, but this seems a little too tradwife for my liking. How can I talk to him without blame and without anger, but be fair to 
myself? If this is PPD, how can I get him to help me?

Today….something at work bothered me. I tried to talk to him about my perspective, but I didn’t get the empathy I was looking for from him. I just broke and started crying uncontrollably. For hours, he said nothing except “hi” and kept looking over at me. He didn’t ask if I was ok or if I wanted to talk about it because he didn’t want to have a confrontation with me. 

Sometimes, it feels like my husband is a wonderful father but doesn’t love me the way I would like. I’ve asked him to hug me. I initiate hugs and ask how his day is. He never reciprocates unless i point it out that I would like him to reciprocate.

Is anyone else feeling like they’re doing everything they can, but they’re still considered the problem or the one who must be avoided? Is anyone else doing so much and feeling burnt out and unloved?

# 1. Join the TikTok Creativity Program/ Creator Fund

Since 2020 TikTok has offered its most popular creators a program to monetize content. In November 2023 TikTok announced some changes to how this works, depending on where you are located in the world. TikTok are shutting down the Creator Fund for users in the US, UK, Germany and France and replacing it with the [Creativity Program](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creativity-program-beta/) starting December 16th.

TikTok says the new fund will enable creators in these countries to make more money for video uploads over a minute. To join, users must have at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days. Earnings will also be based on views and other TikTok engagement metrics.

Are you a creator in Italy and Spain? Users in these countries can still monetize their profiles through the TikTok Creator Fund. Creators need to hit some prerequisites to join the program and begin receiving money from the platform. Creator Fund members earn money based on the number of engagements they get on their content.  
  
**2. Run TikTok ads**  
About 67% of 18-19 year olds and 56% of 20-29 year olds are on TikTok. This makes TikTok marketing a strong advertising choice for brands wanting to market their products to Gen Z. TikTok ads come with simple, powerful tools to help you advertise to millions of users. Ad formats vary by region, but all let you personalize your targeting by age, location, interest and other factors. You can select one or a few formats that work best for your brand.

The most popular types of TikTok ads include:

**In-feed video:** Appear on the For You Page of TikTok users who meet your targeting parameters.

**Brand takeover:** This lets your ad expand to the width of the whole screen for a few seconds. Then it becomes an in-feed video ad.

**Hashtag challenges**: Create appealing challenges that encourage user-generated content. These challenges appear in the Discovery section on TikTok. This option is only available to managed brands that work in collaboration with TikTok sales representatives.

There are several more types of TikTok ads you can experiment with, but note that some are only available to certain types of accounts.  
  
**3. Collect tips or donations**  
TikTok has introduced a tipping feature that allows select creators to earn money from tips and donations. Fans can use this feature to show gratitude to the creators they love.

Video gifts let viewers send creators virtual gifts and coins. Some creators can collect gifts during a live stream. Gifts can be redeemed for Diamonds—TikTok’s digital currency.

When you save up enough Diamonds, you can trade them for real cash.

Creators can also use tipping platforms to earn money. Tipeee, Ko-fi and Buy Me a Coffee can be connected to your TikTok account to function as a tip jar.  
  
**4. Collaborate with a creator**  
To generate revenue on TikTok, leveraging existing popular creators is undoubtedly a strategic shortcut. These creators on TikTok boast a vast fan base and highly engaged communities, and collaborating with them can swiftly elevate the visibility and influence of a brand or product. However, establishing contact with these popular creators and reaching a collaboration agreement is not an easy task.

# 5. Try affiliate marketing

Through affiliate marketing programs, creators and other businesses can promote and sell another company’s products or services for a commission.

To be a successful affiliate marketer, you need to generate sales online. Focus on promoting products that best align with your target audience. Create engaging videos that present affiliate products, showcasing the value and why you recommend purchasing them. Try promoting brands you like and trust, sharing affiliate links or codes to track purchases influenced by your account.

If you’re an in-house marketer, create an affiliate marketing program with clear guidelines and instructions on how to participate. Invite TikTokers who align with your brand values and target audience to participate. Encourage affiliates to promote the products or services that best align with your goals and shared audience. And most importantly, implement a tracking system so you can monitor affiliate performance and commission payments.  
  


# 6. Grow and sell TikTok accounts

Organically growing a TikTok account could take months. However, you can buy an established account to get an instant boost of followers.

To successfully make money selling TikTok accounts, creators should focus on niche topics that can be sustained by the buyer. This will make it easier for the buyer to continue posting similar content and maintain follower engagement.

Brands considering buying an established account should perform due diligence. An account with a lot of followers but low engagement may not provide the return you’re looking for. Also, ensure the account serves an audience you target and the content aligns with your brand and goals.  
  


# 7. Publish sponsored posts

For smaller activations, brands can sponsor posts that live directly on creators’ profiles. Similar to creator collaborations, these campaigns allow brands to pay content creators to promote their products in organic posts. Sponsor single posts or create a series. If it starts trending, you can boost the post to expand its reach even further.  
  


# 8. Sell your products and merchandise

Merchandise, merchandise, merchandise. This tried-and-true strategy applies to TikTok as well. Turn original artwork, quotes or your brand’s logo into merch and promote it on TikTok. Feature your existing products in tutorials or showcase your product alongside a trend.  
  


# 9. Set up a TikTok shop

TikTok partnered with Shopify to launch the [TikTok Shopping](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-ways-to-discover-and-shop-on-tiktok) feature. Brands and creators can become official TikTok merchants and sell directly in the app.

By creating a TikTok Shop, you can showcase products on in-feed videos, lives and product showcase tabs. If [eligible](https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10000749) for this feature, you can signup to become a seller in the [TikTok Seller Center](https://seller.tiktok.com/), where you can manage inventory, orders, creator partnerships, promotions and more. However, the seller center is only available in select regions.



# 10. Offer exclusive content on TikTok

TikTok just launched a new monetization feature in June of 2023 called [TikTok Series](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-a-new-way-for-creators-to-share-premium-content-with-series). This new feature is a way to create exclusive content that lives behind a paywall.

Interested creators can apply to get access to this new feature, but there are other criteria they need to meet as well:

* Creators must be 18+
* Their account must be at least 30 days old
* They must have at least 10,000 followers
* They must have posted 3+ public videos in the last 30 days
* They must have at least 1,000 views in the last 30 days

Creators who have less than 10,000 followers may still be eligible if they can provide a link to premium content they’ve successfully sold on other platforms.

Your Series can include up to 80 videos total, each up to 20 minutes long. This can be a great way to provide valuable educational content to your audience for a one-time fee. You can set the price for each TikTok Series you create, with payment options ranging from $0.99 to $189.99.  
  


# 11. Provide virtual gifts

Another monetization feature is virtual gifts on your videos. People who really enjoy your content can send you virtual gifts as a token of their appreciation—which can then be converted into actual money.

Turn on the gift option to have a small gift box icon appear next to the comment box. Users interested in leaving a gift can tap it to visit this interface:

https://preview.redd.it/dm72wcc6v1je1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef82060cccdf8e48390f23e6673620987aeb9ffa

Coin packages can be bought in the following increments:

* 20 coins: $0.29
* 65 coins: $0.99
* 330 coins: $4.99
* 660 coins: $9.99
* 1,321 coins: $19.99
* 3,303 coins: $49.99
* 6,607 coins: $99.99
* 16,500 coins: $249.99

These coins can then be used to buy and send virtual gifts to a user’s favorite creators, with gifts ranging from 5 to 3,000 coins. Turn on virtual gifts to offer this option to your viewers.



# 12. Host live events or workshops

TikTok Live is another great way to make money. Similar to virtual video gifts, users can also send live gifts. The little gift box icon will appear at the bottom of a live video for users to tap and buy different gifts. The ranges on these are even bigger, with some being just a single coin and others going up to 10s of thousands of coins.

Several TikTok creators have shared how live streaming can be used to make money. One creator makes between $20-$300 every time they go live and another brought in $34,000 within a single month—just from live streaming.

Make sure your live videos are entertaining and valuable so that users keep wanting to tune in. The more consistent viewers you get, the more likely they are to stick around and send you virtual gifts.  
  


# 13. Offer personalized shoutouts

If you have a large following, TikTokers who want to grow their accounts may be willing to pay for personalized shoutouts. Pick a price point and sell shoutouts as yet another way to make money. Your price may be a bit of trial and error. If you’re getting no bites, you may want to lower it. But on the other hand, if you’re getting a ton of interest, you might be able to increase your price.

You can then shout these people out during a live video or during a feed video. You might even choose to offer two different price points (with feed videos costing more) so that users can choose where they’d like to be shouted out.  
  


# 14. Sell digital products

Finally, consider selling digital products. You can create a shop with TikTok and link to your digital products from there, making it easy to make a sale. Promote your products within your videos and include your shop’s URL in your profile so users can easily find it.

My car is in the shop; my mom is sick therefore she can’t come do the Valentine’s Day craft we had in mind (baby foot prints in the shape of a heart on a wooden fridge magnet.) 
And yes- I’ll admit it- I’m lonely. But I’m beyond grateful just to be here in our safe, clean home with my beautiful baby…. To know her and love her; to have had coffee with a well-missed friend today. My grandma gifted us fresh flowers (one of my favorite things!). 
Next year we will plan an outing together, and will be sure to do a fun craft, of course. From then on, I’ll be sure to give her a gift basket and card and make sure she has the help to make me a card from my family/a friend, of course. 
But I just wanted to say I’m SO thankful to spend this holiday with her. 
Solo moms, what plans, crafts, or traditions are you doing with your kiddos this year?! It’s easy to fall into the “missing out” mindset without a partner, but I feel that it will always be my duty to show my daughter what it means to be cherished and to show/feel love today and every other day of the year.

1ip4j3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/unrequited_love/comments/1ip4j3m/_/,???,"It was short lived, 4 months at most. I met a girl and we hit it off. We had great conversation and a lot time spent together. I fell in love with her on our third date while watching her smile and laugh as we played foosball. Of course I didn't say anything as  it was too soon and instead kept spending time with her. She'd come to my place, I'd go to hers and we always had a good time. December 20th rolls around, 3 months into our relationship and she says she's worried about commiting. Six months prior to this, June, she had a bad break-up, a relationship of 2 years. She tells me she's not sure if shes ready to start again andI tell her I understand as at this point, 35 years old, I've been in the same position before and so we settle on a mutual ""companionship"" type of situation. We stay in contact for the next month while we're both visiting family for the holidays and she takes a vacation to Scotland to see a friend. When she's back state side we finally meet again and have a great time together. Great sex, great conversation, all in all just a great time together. Then on Sunday, we're enjoying coffee, doing our morning crossword, she pauses, holds her hands to her face, stutters my name and says she wants no more.  I'm devastated, I sit there trying to cellect my thoughts, try to question her to understand why but I can't put my thoughts into words. I drive home, a long 2 hours and can't help but think what happened, where did I go wrong. I felt like I was pulling her out of her past, trying to show her once again she's worthy of love. Weeks pass without contact. I'm in her town doing some shopping for leather working goods, theres a bunch of fresh snow in the area, and as a traveling nurse she hasn't been home in weeks, so I took the shovel I carry in my truck and shoveled out her porch and driveway while she was out of town. My intentions were pure and out of love,  just trying to make her life easier in anyway possible, but she sees her newly shoveled porch and driveway through her ring camera. I didn't want her to know it was me but she knows, she's knows it's me as I've done it for her in the past and she sends me a text not long after. A text filled with vitriol, dispise, and hatred. I didn't want her to know, It wasn't long, us being together, right around 4 months, but I fell for this girl, and I fell hard. She wants nothing to do with me but I can't get her out of my head. I used to have dreams of us in the future, a house with a couple of rugrats running around. Now I'm coming home to a cold, quiet apartment, longing for a woman that doesn't want me. I know I have to let her go, but god damn it's hard to let go of someoneI once thought to be apart of my future. I think about her every day. In the past 2 months since i've last seen her, I average 3 hours of sleep, and when I do, I'm dreaming of her. I'm 35 now, I've only loved two women, and both have gone. I feel like I'm lost, like, I'm stranded and I don't have a way out. I don't know what it is or what I want from this post. Maybe it's for someone to just tell me to stop being a fag, man up and get over it. Maybe it's because it's my only way to type out my story, but for those who have been in a similar situation, how did you express your feelings, or did you bottle it up, swallow your pride and struggle through. I've been wanting to reach out to her one more time just to get my feelings out even though I know it won't change anything. I guess i'm just stuck and need a little guidence....

1ip4htk,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1ip4htk/the_second_chance/,"""The Second Chance""","The rain fell in sheets, blurring the neon lights of the city into a kaleidoscope of colors. I stood under the awning of a convenience store, staring at the crumpled piece of paper in my hand. It was a job rejection letter—the fifth one this month. My savings were nearly gone, and the weight of failure pressed down on me like the storm clouds above.

I had always been a dreamer. Growing up, I believed I could change the world, or at least my little corner of it. But life had other plans. A series of bad decisions, missed opportunities, and a heartbreak that left me hollow had brought me to this moment—standing in the rain, wondering if I’d ever find my way back.

As I shoved the letter into my pocket, I noticed a figure huddled in the alley across the street. It was an old man, his clothes soaked, his face hidden beneath a tattered hood. Something about him made me pause. Maybe it was the way he shivered, or the way he clutched a small, worn bag to his chest. Or maybe it was the fact that, for the first time in months, I felt a flicker of something other than self-pity.

I crossed the street, my shoes sloshing through puddles. When I reached him, I crouched down and asked if he was okay. He looked up, his eyes tired but kind, and shook his head. “Just trying to stay dry,” he muttered.

I didn’t have much to give, but I bought him a hot coffee and a sandwich from the convenience store. As I handed them to him, he smiled—a small, grateful smile that made my chest ache. We sat there in silence for a while, the rain tapping out a rhythm on the pavement.

“You’re a good kid,” he said finally, his voice rough but warm. “Not many people stop to help an old man like me.”

I shrugged, unsure of what to say. “I just… I know what it’s like to feel invisible.”

He studied me for a moment, then reached into his bag and pulled out a small, leather-bound notebook. The cover was worn, the edges frayed, but it looked like it had been well-loved. He handed it to me.

“What’s this?” I asked.

“A second chance,” he said simply. “I used to write in that notebook. Stories, mostly. About people I met, places I’ve been. It kept me going when things got tough. Maybe it’ll do the same for you.”

I opened the notebook and flipped through the pages. They were filled with handwritten notes, sketches, and fragments of stories. It was messy and beautiful, a testament to a life lived fully, even in its struggles.

“Why are you giving this to me?” I asked.

He smiled again, this time with a hint of sadness. “Because I can see it in your eyes. You’ve lost your way. But helping others—even in small ways—can remind you who you are. Maybe this’ll help you find your story again.”

I didn’t know what to say. Before I could thank him, he stood up, slung his bag over his shoulder, and walked away, disappearing into the rain.

That night, I sat in my tiny apartment and read through the notebook. Each page was a glimpse into someone else’s life—a struggling single mother, a runaway teenager, a war veteran trying to find peace. Their stories were raw and real, and they reminded me of something I’d forgotten: that everyone is fighting their own battles, and even the smallest act of kindness can make a difference.

I started writing again. At first, it was just scribbles in the margins of the notebook, but soon, the words began to flow. I wrote about the old man, about the people I’d met, and about my own struggles. And as I wrote, something inside me began to heal.

Months later, I found myself standing in front of a small crowd at a local café, reading one of my stories aloud. When I finished, there was silence—not the kind that feels heavy, but the kind that feels full. Then, someone started clapping, and soon the room was filled with applause.

Afterward, a woman approached me. She had tears in her eyes and told me that my story had reminded her of her own journey. “Thank you,” she said. “You have no idea how much I needed to hear that.”

As I walked home that night, I thought about the old man and the notebook he’d given me. He was right—helping others had given me a second chance. Not just to rebuild my life, but to rediscover the person I’d always wanted to be.

The rain had stopped, and the city glistened under the streetlights. For the first time in a long time, I felt hopeful. I didn’t know what the future held, but I knew one thing for certain: I was ready to keep writing my story.

And maybe, just maybe, I could help someone else write theirs too.",1,1739514750.0,story,0,1.0,False
1ip4h30,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1ip4h30/elimination_diet/,Elimination diet,"Good morning everyone, I’m sure y’all have heard this before and it’s nothing groundbreaking but doing a primarily a meat and fruit based diet has helped me get rid of 90% of my eczema. I know it’s not the magic pill that everyone like myself wants but it’s worth the try if you can commit. 

I’ve had eczema since I was a baby, moved to NYC around 10 years ago and had it flare up in the last 8-9 years. Dry lips, redness around lips and mouth, area between upper lip and nose would flare up every time I shaved, elbow creases, knee creases, back, thighs, hands and fingers would crack constantly. My mother told me every time I would fast for a month for Ramadan my eczema had improved. I wouldn’t change my diet but having a ‘eating window’ did help me and my inflammation. 

Anyway the doctor recommended the usual stuff, steroid ointments and Cerave, my most recent doctor told me to stop brushing my teeth because it aggravated the skin around my lips and mouth, I had since stopped seeing him. Eczema has affected my dating life, my work life, my overall mental health and I’m confident you guys can relate. 

Im a big fan of Dr. Jordan Peterson and there is a story he tells of how he went on a DRASTIC elimination diet that cured his health problems and his daughter had gone viral for her carnivore blog. If you’re still reading look up Joe Rogan Experience #1070 with Dr Jordan Peterson (2hr 13minute mark). And look up Mikhaila Peterson’s carnivore diet BLOG. She basically cured her autoimmune disease with an Elimination diet. 

Back to my story, I had always eaten average, mostly home cooked, somewhat healthy but couldn’t stop eating bread, pasta, rice, etc. I know it’s expensive and I know it’s hard to COMMIT but im convinced that it would help the inflammation go away and make your health better in one way or another. I started primarily eating eggs, steak, chicken, green and black tea, honey, coffee, and still haven’t stopped my dark chocolate and candy bars habit. Around Mid November I committed to eating “clean”. Mostly steak and eggs, still eat fruits like berries and oranges, kiwis. Don’t really like apples or veggies. Still eat bread (sandwich) every once in a while, but I TRY to stay away from: BREAD, PASTA, RICE, TOMATOES, SUGAR, PROCESSED MEATS as best as I can. I like I said I slip up and occasionally have fries, sandwiches and chips, but it’s not a DAILy occurrence, more like a monthly. My favorite “treats” are candy bars and dark chocolates, but other than that I stay away from sugar. No soda. No fast food unless it’s a burger. From mid November to now Mid February my skin has returned to normal, I want to thank God every day and feel like a new person but I can’t ignore that changing my diet has been the single most important factor. 
I know it’s expensive, I know it’s hard, I know that not everyone can just eat steak and eggs for 70% of their meals, but trust me it works. I love you guys and I’m here if anyone needs help. I don’t wanna share pictures because it’s personal but I would say I had “mild to severe” eczema and had flare ups where I couldn’t go to work and had my spirit broken.

1ip4g7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ip4g7w/the_power_of_small_wins_how_tiny_habits_can_lead/,“The Power of Small Wins: How Tiny Habits Can Lead to Big Changes”,"We’ve all been there — setting a lofty New Year’s resolution or a grand life goal, only to feel overwhelmed and give up within weeks. The problem isn’t the goal itself; it’s the approach. Big goals often feel intimidating because they require massive effort and discipline. But what if the secret to success lies in focusing on small, consistent wins instead?

**The Science Behind Small Wins**  
Research shows that small wins have a profound psychological impact. According to Teresa Amabile, a Harvard Business School professor, progress — even in tiny increments — boosts motivation, creativity, and confidence. When you achieve a small win, your brain releases dopamine, the “feel-good” chemical, which reinforces the behavior and makes you want to repeat it. Over time, these small wins compound into significant results.

**How to Build Tiny Habits That Stick**

1. **Start Ridiculously Small**: Want to exercise more? Start with just one push-up a day. Want to read more? Read one page before bed. The key is to make the habit so easy that you can’t say no.
2. **Anchor It to an Existing Routine**: Attach your new habit to something you already do. For example, do a quick stretch after brushing your teeth or meditate for one minute after your morning coffee.
3. **Celebrate Every Win**: Acknowledge your progress, no matter how small. Did you floss one tooth? Great! Did you write one sentence of your book? Amazing! Celebration reinforces the habit loop.
4. **Focus on Consistency, Not Perfection**: It’s better to do a tiny habit every day than to do it perfectly once in a while. Consistency builds momentum.

**Real-Life Examples of Small Wins**

* **Fitness**: Instead of aiming for an hour at the gym, start with a 10-minute walk. Over time, you’ll naturally want to do more.
* **Writing**: Commit to writing 100 words a day. By the end of the year, you’ll have a 36,500-word manuscript.
* **Learning**: Spend 15 minutes a day learning a new language or skill. In a year, you’ll have invested over 90 hours into your growth.
* **Decluttering**: Tackle one drawer or shelf at a time. Before you know it, your entire home will feel more organized.

**The Compound Effect of Small Wins**  
Small wins may seem insignificant at first, but their power lies in their cumulative effect. Just like compound interest in finance, small habits compound over time to create massive change. For example, reading 10 pages a day adds up to 3,650 pages in a year — that’s 12–15 books! Similarly, saving $5 a day can grow into a substantial emergency fund over time.

**Overcoming the “All-or-Nothing” Mindset**  
One of the biggest obstacles to embracing small wins is the “all-or-nothing” mindset. We often think that if we can’t do something perfectly, it’s not worth doing at all. But progress isn’t linear. Missing a day or falling short of your goal doesn’t mean you’ve failed. What matters is getting back on track and continuing to move forward, one small step at a time.

Big changes don’t have to start with big actions. In fact, the most sustainable and transformative changes often begin with tiny, consistent habits. By focusing on small wins, you build confidence, momentum, and a sense of accomplishment that propels you toward your larger goals. So, the next time you feel overwhelmed by a big dream, remember: start small, celebrate often, and trust the process. Your future self will thank you.",1,1739514578.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I’ve been to a few hobbyist places but all attempts at socialization have ended in awkward moments and weird looks. “Wtf is with this guy” type stuff. I’m not even inappropriate I guess I’m just that odd.  

Women? I get along great with my mom and my older sister (39) is the closest thing I have to a best friend now. We take walks and hang out regularly. Laugh together. Get coffee and support each other through hard times etc. She says I’ve been the only reliable constant in her life and I’m grateful for that. But she has 3 kids and a new job. She’s very busy and getting busier. I don’t see her often now.

In a dating context you ask? I’ve never dated. Ugly and short. I’m also a pure blue collar boy so I don’t even own nice clothes to go out in haha. I’m socially awkward to the point where even other men are wary of me. I refuse to bother women at all knowing this.

So that’s it. Work, home, work, home with zero human interaction in the process. I’m sleepwalking through life now and little moments of consciousness I see myself in a mirror, older, lonelier, sadder and only slightly less poor. 

Im ungrateful. I recognize that. I have health. Good money. Home ownership. Some people would kill to have my position. 

But I have no people. This is the rest of my life. No friends. No romance. No family of my own. I’d trade (nearly) every dollar to be someone people like and want to be around. For friends. For love. But that isn’t in the cards. I’m dead. My body is the only thing that’s alive and moving. I’m just not brave enough to finish it off. ",5,1739514375.0,SuicideWatch,1,1.0,False

You’re not alone. Not anymore.

I live alone in a small apartment on the second floor. The kind of place that makes you feel like you’re just another number, like you’ve been shoved into the back of the building and forgotten. Quiet. Private. Simple.

At least, that’s how it was supposed to be.

The First Thing

I came home late one night after a long shift at work.

I’m always tired after those, but this time was different. Exhaustion felt heavy, like I could barely drag myself through the front door.

But when I stepped into my apartment…

The air felt wrong.

I didn’t know what was off at first.

But then I noticed it.

The door to the bathroom was open.

I always close it. Always.

It’s not something I consciously think about. It’s just something I do.

But tonight, it was open.

I didn’t think much of it at first, just assumed I had forgotten.

I shut the door.

But even as I did it, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.

I felt watched.

Not by someone in the apartment.

But by something that had been here for far longer.

The Second Thing

The next morning, I woke up late.

I didn’t have time for coffee, but as I stumbled out of bed and got dressed, I saw it.

A hair tie.

Not one of mine.

It was a bright purple one, with a pattern I’d never seen before.

I don’t know how long it had been there, but I know for sure it wasn’t mine.

I have a blue one. Always have.

I didn’t question it. Not yet.

I threw it in the trash.

The Third Thing

A few days passed, and everything seemed normal again.

I was finally adjusting.

Then, the scratching started.

It wasn’t loud. Just soft at first.

A faint scrape.

Almost like someone was running their nails across the wall.

But it was coming from inside the walls.

I tried to ignore it.

The walls of this building are old. The pipes, the wiring, the foundation—all creaking and groaning like they’re one bad storm away from collapsing.

But the scratching never stopped.

It was always there.

In the middle of the night.

It started getting louder.

Then, one night…

It was a knock.

Not from the outside. Not from the door.

From inside the wall.

A soft, steady knock.

It wasn’t the sound of pipes shifting.

It wasn’t the sound of the building settling.

It was a human knock.

A deliberate, planned knock.

I stood frozen in my kitchen.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Then, silence.

I should’ve called the landlord. I should’ve told someone.

But the thing is—I didn’t.

Because I was terrified that if I did, it would get worse.

The Fourth Thing

A few days later, I came home to find the bathroom door open again.

I couldn’t ignore it this time.

I went inside.

And I saw it.

A bloody handprint.

Not on the door. Not on the mirror.

It was on the floor.

A large handprint, smeared in thick, dark red, stretching out across the linoleum.

I froze.

I didn’t touch it. I didn’t breathe.

I ran. I grabbed my phone, dialed 911.

But when I turned back to look, the handprint was gone.

There was no sign of it.

Just clean tiles.

I’m still not sure if I imagined it.

But I know I didn’t.

The Fifth Thing

That night, I was in bed, trying to ignore the scratching.

I’d just turned off the lights, and I was about to fall asleep when—

The doorbell rang.

It was late. 3:22 AM.

I don’t get visitors.

I wasn’t expecting anyone.

I went to the door.

No one was there.

But when I checked the peephole, I saw someone standing on the other side.

Not looking at me.

But looking down.

At the floor.

I thought it was some mistake. A drunk person, maybe.

But when I opened the door to ask what they wanted—

There was no one there.

The hallway was empty.

I looked up and down the stairs.

Nothing.

Except—

A single, purple hair tie was lying on the ground, right in front of my door.

The same one from earlier.

The one I’d thrown away.

The Last Thing

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I didn’t want to.

I knew something wasn’t right.

The scratching had stopped.

But the silence wasn’t comforting.

I had to go to the bathroom.

So, I stepped into the hallway, then stopped cold.

The bathroom door was wide open.

I had closed it. I knew I had.

But now, it was open.

I approached it slowly.

The light was off, but I could still see.

Because something was in there.

The air was thick, and I could see it.

A figure.

Standing.

Not facing the door.

Not even looking at the mirror.

But standing, tall, in the center of the room, facing the corner.

I whispered, “Hello?”

The figure twitched.

And then it whispered something back.

A name.

My name.

But it wasn’t my voice.

It was softer. Slower.

I didn’t move.

I didn’t speak.

I just stood there, watching, as the figure slowly turned toward me.

And then—its eyes met mine.

You’re not alone.

It’s still here.

And it knows your name.",1,1739513933.0,u_Far-Race6655,0,1.0,False
