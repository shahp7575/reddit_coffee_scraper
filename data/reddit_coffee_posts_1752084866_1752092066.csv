But I’ve been having trouble with my breaker - anytime I go to use an appliance the fuse blows and my landlord says it’s fine. He’s gotten his own electrical guy out who said “your appliances are old” and “you’re using too many appliances”. But this has happened when I’ve gone to make a cup of coffee (only using one appliance) the fuses blowing are kitchen 1, microwave, and kitchen 2. They all have the colorful arrows next to it: is this correlated? Why would the fuses be blowing? Surely the answer isn’t to keep re-flipping them from the breaker box. 

My apartment just installed automatic dimmers in the building and ever since they the fuses have been blowing. Not sure if this is related.

It is Salt Lake Roasting Co.  

Absolute 5 star bacon breakfast burrito perfectly paired with a mocha.

I used to go to their ild location by the library years ago and i remember they had an amazing frozen chai.  And im looking forward to trying some of their other menu items.  I also like the loft seating.

Most days, I’m okay.
You still cross my mind, but it doesn’t ache the way it used to.

That date used to be ours.
A quiet anniversary, one of those little ones we used to hold onto.
And for whatever reason, today pulled me under again.

I miss you.
Not just the version I fell in love with, 
but the one who felt like my best friend.
The one who could make me laugh mid-panic.
The one who never flinched when I was dorky, dramatic, or quietly insecure.
The one who mirrored me in a way no one else ever has.

I still find you in the little things.
In ordering my coffee with “a dash of cinnamon.”
In Spotify shuffling to your favorite songs.
In quiet moments when a memory sneaks up and makes me smile.

I could talk forever about what our connection meant and how it changed me.
But maybe all I really want to say is this:

Thank you - for loving me, even if just for a moment.
For making me feel chosen. Seen. Safe.
And I’m sorry we didn’t make it.

I’ll always keep a small part of you
tucked in the softest part of me.
Still rooting for you.
Always.

1lvss5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1lvss5y/alcohol_vs_canister_calculator_and_graph/,Alcohol vs Canister calculator and graph,"So I find I'm always struggling to make a call on whether to take the alcohol stove or the canister stove. So figured I'd leverage our new AI revolution and get chatGPT to make me a little calculator as well as plot the weight vs number of boils comparing my two set ups.

**Set ups:**

Alcohol:

* Stove: Toaks ti stove + Evernew cross-mount + Toaks windscreen: 45g total
* Fuel: either a 250ml 30g bottle or a 500ml bottle 43g

Canister:

* Stove: Soto WindMaster: 67g
* Fuel: either 110g or 227g canisters depending on number of boils

Calculator has input for ml of alcohol required to boil 450ml of water, which is what fits in my Toaks 550ml titanium cup. Same for grams of canister gas.

* For alcohol, my testing showed about 30ml of alcohol, assuming no wind or good wind protection offered by the windscreen
* For LPG, the Soto stove stats show about 8g to boil 450ml in real world conditions. These are the defaults but you can change them based on your experience.

You also have an input of number of boils per person per day. You can enter multiple comma-separated values to see comparisons. My minimum is 2 (morning coffee, and dehydrated dinner), but I sometimes do 4 boils to also make miso soup and tea in the eve.

Here is an example of 2 people, 2 days (common weekend trip):

|Boils/day|Total boils|Alcohol Stove|Alcohol Bottle|Alcohol Fuel|Canister Stove|Canister (incl. fuel)|Fuel Used|Margin (g)|Recommended|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|8|45.0|1 × 250ml32.4|189.6|67.0|110g can212.0|64.0|\-12.0|Alcohol stove|
|3|12|45.0|1 × 500ml50.0|284.4|67.0|110g can212.0|96.0|100.4|Canister stove|
|4|16|45.0|1 × 500ml50.0|379.2|67.0|227g can337.0|128.0|70.2|Canister stove|

In short, alcohol wins only when trip is **under 8 boils**, but also is the same weight as canister at **14 boils** because of the jump to the bigger 337g canister.

Here is the code below.

The day before we had met for a coffee in our usual place. 
When my mum was in ICU it was discovered that she was an organ donor so they kept her going so they could organise that part. I had to decide which parts to donate and what to keep. 
I was changed forever and I didn’t know it. 
Then it was down to me to organise my mum’s funeral arrangements (never had done it before). The funeral home was terrible I thought they would be there to help me at this horrific time. They didn’t help at all actually caused more stress and the church where my mum was being buried also caused me stress.
After the funeral I had to sort out my mum’s paperwork and financial affairs. That has only just finished. I am exhausted 😩.
I desperately need to work due to my own financial situation. I was lucky that I could take 10 months off but I feel disconnected from society and feel like a job would overwhelm me.

1lvsov2,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1lvsov2/remembering_my_bad_dates_x3/,Remembering my bad dates X3,"I've been told that sharing my experiences would help other people feel less anxious about going on dates fearing it will go sideways, so, here you go, one of my worst dates to date, let's have some fun reading my misfortunes together.

Back in the day I was taking this girl to a pretty secluded event in which you needed either a car or someone to drive you -there were no buses as the place was outside the city limits and under my understanding didn't have a permit-, so an acquaintance of her mom dropped us and left, we hanged around, enjoyed the music, the food, got some drinks, everything was going smooth and chill until the last event when they were going to do a firework show with BG music, people started gathering around to sit on the dirt and we backed away from the crowd to exchange kisses and whatnot, we found a parked trailer and we did our stuff behind it while the fireworks illuminated our surroundings and the music was just close enough to mute our voices, we lost track of the time as the sounds of the crowd, the explosions and the music trailed off into the night.

We came back with a start, the trailer was moving and we were covered in dirt and leaves, we stood up as the vehicles were retreating leaving behind trails of dust, I checked my phone, 2 AM, I asked her If anyone was coming for us, she said no, I being the completely calm girl than I am told her not to worry, we could just hitch a ride with the guys from the event, so we ran to catch them. It was a bust, no one wanted two disheveled girls covered in dirt and smelling of alcohol in their trucks, also back then I looked like a punk, meaning I came across as menacing, so short story short, we appeared like 2 junkies that haven't had their fix and no one gave us a ride, we had to walk 8 km from this god-forsaken place in the middle of nowhere to the nearest highway, it took us almost 2 hours but we did it, the street lights were reassuring and the feeling of civilization filled us with energy, we started calling people to see if anyone could come and rescue us but at almost 5 AM there was no response from either of our attempts.

So we walked towards the city as the sun started to show his face among a sea of gray clouds, its heat on our skin was comforting, I asked her if the date was going well and she just looked at me with puppy eyes holding back tears, I hugged her and gave her a kiss on the cheek and promised to buy her a greasy breakfast and to pounce on her once we reached her house, she smiled at my joke and kept walking, the city lights were getting closer each passing minute and the warmth of the sun kept us in high spirits. And then the first bus of the day appeared, it was completely empty sans some maintenance guys that were joking around at the back, we took a seat and watched as the clouds got darker and darker and the sunlight started fading, I put my arm around her to keep her warm and fell asleep in a second.

I woke up again with a start, the bus had broke down and it was starting to rain, the driver was outside with the guys assisting him with the motor, apparently there was nothing to be done so they started calling for backup, it was 7 AM and we were both hungry and cold, I took my phone and called my dad, voice mail, I woke her up and asked for her phone, taxis were unavailable at our location but the kind lady responding pointed out the nearest pick-up place, a mall with a cinema just shy of 3 km away, I thanked her and asked my lovely companion If she could walk a little more and under the rain, she -no surprise- said no so I didn't press and started thinking of solutions to this pickle.

The answer came to us half an hour later in the form of a gray Sedan that stopped to assist the blinking bus in the middle of the highway, it was a dad and his baby on their way to pick up her mom, we asked him if he could take us to the nearest mall and he gladly accepted, we got in the car and before I could say ""eggs and bacon with a side of ice-cream"" we were on the still closed mall, the guy asked us if we will be OK and I reassured him to not worry, we were going to have something to eat as soon as the place opened and people started flocking in, so he waved us goodbye and we walked towards the doors of the still pitch dark restaurant, we waited there until 9 AM when trucks filled with frozen food started arriving and our stomachs began to growl.

A girl with an umbrella and earphones approached the doors from the parking lot and gave us a side-look, I turned to her and asked if they had maple syrup and she said yes with a confused look, I replied ""Nice, can we get a table?"" and she told me in a very polite tone to wait until the workers finished cleaning, so I woke up my now almost-girlfriend and told her to do some stretching with me to keep warm, the workers watched us in confusion as we started doing pushups on the sidewalk and running in the same spot.

The girl came back, it was almost 10 AM, she invited us inside and handed a pair of menus that we read in like 10 seconds, I hastily blurted out ""6 fried eggs, one fruit serving, 2 orders of hot-cakes with ham on the top, 2 coffees with milk, 3 scoops of vanilla ice-cream and a quarter of sugar free yogurt with nuts please"", the girl wrote down the order, her pencil moving like it had a life on its own, and told us to pick any table, we chose to sit by the side that was starting to receive the warm sun-rays and we waited, the staff turned on the AC and the smells from the kitchen wafted slowly to us indicating we were almost at the end of this journey.

Our order came and we ate with care and delicacy so not to reassert ourselves as the junkies our current state made us appear, I even drew us thanking the staff for their attention on the bill and left leaving a good tip.

I need a male perspective on something that a guy did to me and left me speechless.
Me [23F] and that guy, let's call him Gary [21M] for the sake of the post had joined this company together at the same time, and trained together alongside with a larger group.
What I'm about to tell you happened last year, but I just can't move on.
I was super introverted back then and had a sever social anxiety but was obliged to work.
I was sitting in the corner of the room, trying my best to open a bottle of water, but I just couldn't and gave up on it. But I was so thirsty and decided to try again and still could not open it. That's when Gary, who was sitting in the opposite side of the room offered to help me, and I had no choice but to agree. Gary stood up from his seat and came to me, took the bottle, opened it, and gave it back to me. That was the moment I fell for him. And that was just the beginning of the story.
That moment was our very first interaction, and we got closer as time went by. He'd ask me why I was not eating when he notices I didn't bring any food. He'd ask me why I'm replacing lunch with just coffee. He was so attentive to me, but never actually overstepped or made his worries obvious to others.
He would act so playful around me and cool and nonchalant around other girls.
We trained for three weeks, and then we started the real work, when I noticed something had shifted. He'd act like I was invisible all of the sudden and the next day he would just go back to his usual self, and this happened a lot that I eventually got used to it and accepted it.
The company offred us during training days each a metal bottle of water with the company logo printed on it. I kept using that bottle but Gary would just use regular plastic bottles, this is actually an important detail, cuz what happened is why I'm unable to move on. I ran out of water, and so did Gary. I had some work to do so I has no time to go fill my bottle, but I saw him going to fill his. I called his name once and gave him my bottle, and I didn't need to say anything else, he just took it, and btw, it was one of the days when he acted I didn't exist. He came back and put my bottle on the table, and I was thirsty so I decided to take a sip. A strong smell of cigarettes hit me as soon as the bottle got close to my face. I don't smoke. Gary is a heavy smoker. I couldn't find any explanation other than he drank from my bottle. But why would he? He had his own bottle, and he came back with his bottle filled, means there were more than enough water in the fountain. Why would he drink from my bottle?
Mind you, this guy got a girlfriend later that worked for a short period in the same company but in a different department, and she looked like a human version of Arial.
I assure you I'm not his type. I'm a bit chubby and was through financial crisis when I met him, so I neglected my appearance so much.
He quit the company after just 4 months (best 4 months in my life) to persue his studies. I got to say goodbye, and it was a very dramatic one.
We're mutual on Instagram. He sees all of my stories but never interacted with them, and we never texted either.
Been 11 months since the last time I saw him and I can't forget about him.
Lots of other sweet moments that happened between us that made me fall for him, and not just the bottle of water incident.

However, I am interested in learning more about the different capabilities of the more complex machines, though I'm not quite sure what I should be prioritizing given my coffee preferences. 

For the grinder, I don't prefer single-dose grinders. I've liked my Silenzio so far, but if I'm giving away the espresso machine, might as well give them the grinder, too.

The Texas Rangers (-130) are favored to win this snoozefest of a matchup against the Los Angeles Angels (+109), but let’s be real—this game might as well be called *The Great Runs Avoidance Act*. Both teams are about as exciting as a spreadsheet audit: the Rangers score 3.8 runs per game (25th in MLB), and the Angels have scored 385 total runs this season (18th). If you’re here for fireworks, bring a sparkler and a sense of irony.

**Why the Rangers?**  
They’re 22-10 as moneyline favorites this season, so they’ve got the ""favorite"" thing down to a science. But don’t expect a slugfest—just a slow, methodical march toward mediocrity. Their key bats (Marcus Semien, Adolis Garcia) are -270/-240 to rack up doubles. Semien, you’re buying the coffee; Garcia, you’re paying for the muffin.

**Why the Angels?**  
The Angels are 46.5% winners as underdogs, which is basically their full-time job. They’ll need Mike Trout (-285 for a hit) to pla

>When Haraz Coffee House opens its second San Francisco location this summer, it will be just the beginning of a blitz into the Bay Area.

>The Michigan-born Yemeni cafe chain — known for its late hours, hospitable environs and unique flavors — is developing 15 future locations across Northern California. Franchise agreements are signed for new cafes in Redwood City, Pleasanton, Dublin, San Jose, Palo Alto and Fremont, the company confirmed this week, and Haraz is close to finalizing another franchise agreement for Berkeley.

>Haraz is also considering establishing a West Coast headquarters in California that would be secondary to its current Dearborn, Michigan, nerve center. The company confirmed this week that it is deciding between Oakland and Santa Monica as its top headquarters sites, but said nothing has been finalized.

>Led by CEO Hamzah Nasser, Haraz opened its first cafe in 2021 and expanded to Illinois, Virginia and North Carolina. It opened its first stop in California in late 2023 at 1452 Franklin St. in San Francisco's Western Addition.

>Ahmed Ali al-Biesery, the franchisee for Haraz's first two San Francisco stores, told the Business Times that [the new Kearny St. store ](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2025/07/03/haraz-coffee-house-yemeni-fidi-union-square-cafe.html)will be open late like the Franklin St. location, which can be a full house until closing at 11 p.m. with regular business from the odd-hours crowd such as police and firefighters.

>As a place to stop and sip awhile, Haraz could play the role of ""third place"" that [Starbucks](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/organization/starbucks) has de-emphasized in recent years. The chain's late hours have pulled in those looking for places to congregate that aren't bars in other markets.

>Some franchises have already signed leases while others are still working out those agreements or looking for sites within their assigned market locale. Generally, the chain seeks out locations between 2,000-2,500 square feet, but in some areas it is open to larger spaces upwards of 3,000 square feet — in Fremont, an upcoming cafe is expected to be roughly 5,000 square feet.

>Former coffee shops, like Starbucks locations, are usually preferred due to the easier buildout. The new store that al-Biesery is opening used to be a Starbucks, which has [reshuffled its downtown footprint](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2023/10/03/starbucks-downtown-store-closures.html) in the postpandemic landscape. A few more of those spaces have hit the market in San Francisco [recently](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2025/01/17/starbucks-protest-store-closure-99-jackson-sbux.html), though there is no shortage of coffee shops downtown.

I have to provide a tiny bit of context before I dive in; *stick with me.*
I'd lost both of my parents by high school graduation so when I was offered an out of state scholarship, I took it. Moved from Tennessee to Oklahoma and made real fast friends with the guy they roomed me with.


A week or two in, my friend let me know that he was about to earn $800 and get a free letter of recommendation for this clinical trial that he was gonna do. Well, I was broke and he also promised that this girl I had my eye on was taking part, too. I was obviously on board. 


It really wasn't even that memorable, the highlight was meeting *her.*
Lara was taking part in the trial too and we spent hours and hours in the waiting room sharing stories and getting close.
The only other memory I have of the trial was sitting for 2-3 hours once a week in a very grey room where I had to talk to a therapist type dude who asked a million questions covering every topic you can think of. 


If memory serves, I’m pretty sure that it had something to do with studying the processes that go into a person’s moral choices. It was purely therapist sessions, too. 
No needles or pills. It was easy. It was over after six weeks and my only symptoms at the end were a little extra pocket money and I’d grown completely attached to Lara. 


Other than using my small fortune to buy Lara a ring and a pretty white dress, nothing worth noting happened between finishing the trial and now. So, the real story starts about 3 weeks ago. 


On the second-to-last Friday in May, I got into an accident on my way home from work. Standard stuff, I got T-boned at an intersection, my car needed a new door and some internal stuff that insurance took care of but I was fine. Whiplash, but that comes with any accident.


Poor bastard in the car that hit me hadn't been wearing his seatbelt, though. Broke the windscreen with his own face. I saw the ambulance take him in a body bag. 


This is where I’m gonna lose you now and you’re gonna resign me to the cuckoos nest but please, stick with me. I'm not crazy. 


Three weeks later, we’re on the second Friday in June now, I'm on my way home from work in the shitty sedan my insurance set me up with while my car’s in the shop. 


Well, I'm honestly still a little on edge on this journey given the recent accident, I’m keeping an extra eye on the road and I get to the intersection where the poor dude T-boned me and I can see from my lane that *he* is fast approaching in the same car he died in three weeks ago. 


Hallucination? *Maybe, but it felt just as real as anything else.*


Just like last time, other drivers were honking and interacting with this dude ‘cos he’s moving way too fast for the speed limit and next thing I hear my radio tune out and then a voice. I know how this sounds. 


The radio said *“You don't have to make the same choice.”*


I don't know if I was subconsciously obeying the radio or if this would've been my course of action either way but I braked. Hard. He kept going and sped right past me this time, but he made sure his eyes met mine for just a second. It was him, it was his car. I don't know.


As soon as he was out of sight, the radio started up again like normal and I had to just make my way home. It shook me, but what can I do? How can I explain this to Lara? 

I didn't. 


I wouldn't be posting if it was just that, though. We’ll skip all of the boring shit in-between and I’ll cut to this morning.


I've been having some trouble with one of my teeth for a few weeks, the pain was sorta just my whole jaw for the first two weeks so I put it down to the accident at first. I did get whiplash and google told me that that could cause jaw pain so that was that for a while until then pain got more localised and it was clear that the issue was a specific tooth. 


I've been taking OTC’s and warming up Lara’s microwave heating pad and holding it to my jaw but this morning, I’d had enough. I know you're not meant to touch your teeth with your grubby digits especially when you think that there is a problem, so I hadn’t. Makes me feel kinda dumb now really. 


I took myself to the bathroom mirror about 8:30 this morning, washed my hands and got to work. It felt as if something foreign like a toothpick or a floss remnant had wedged itself somehow inside my tooth and after 4-5 minutes of yanking and scraping, I felt something cold hit my tongue. 


I spat it into my hand to see what had been bugging me and I was immediately confused. I’ve had 34 years on this planet, it's not too often that I come across something new. 


It looked like a pin, but it wasn't a pin.


I knew that I needed to find a way to inspect this tiny tooth inhabitant so I took a few photos with my phone to try and pick up the details that my eyes couldn’t. What I was holding did resemble a pin, the part that was directly inside my tooth was no thicker than a staple and no longer than an eyelash and it had a tiny round base that I assume was to keep it in place.



There was enamel residue on the base part, so I think that there was some kind of veneer adhesive or something ensuring it stayed stuck.
On the inside of the base was the only tangible clue, the letters **‘N.O.S’** had been engraved in tiny letters. 


So, I took to google. I tried a few searches like *‘N.O.S tooth pin’*, *‘N.O.S device’* but nothing yielded anything useful until I tried *‘N.O.S dental implant’.*


The A.I Overview at the top of the page said *“In some instances, the phrase ‘N.O.S Tooth Implant’ can be used to refer to the minuscule, pin-like devices used by psychologists to carry out Neural Observation Studies”.*


My eyes were pulled from the words I was trying to understand down to a search link result. It was *purple*, not blue, though. That usually means that my browser has accessed this page in the past, but I certainly had never seen it before. 


The search result was titled **‘Controversial Clinical Trial Shut Down In 2009 May Have Continued Without Consent’** and when I tell you that I've never clicked a link so fast in my life, I mean it. As the page loaded, I was already hovering my fingers over *‘command’* and *‘P’* on the keyboard so that I’d have a hard copy of whatever this was to look at, you've got to understand how quickly my paranoia was escalating in those moments. I'm not sure why, it just felt important. 


When it finally loaded, my eyes bounced from one disturbing keyword to another before settling on a line that read *‘…and even though the study was shut down due to the concerns surrounding ethical standards, evidence has come to light that suggest that a good number of the participants from the 2009 study are completely unaware that the clinical trial never came to a close.’.*


My brain rattled as it tried to process the words, nothing made sense. I have never pressed ‘print’ so fast. I don't know, I thought it might feel a little more real if I could hold it in my hands, you know?


I made my way to the printer to find that it had only printed the header of the newspaper it had been clipped from, that’s it.  None of the article content had printed so I switched back round to send it to print again. But, the article was gone. *Properly gone.*


I refreshed the page and got *404’d,* I pressed back and got a different error so I re-typed the google search to get it back that way and this time, google had no results. The A.I overview was gone. My search history? Completely intact *other* than the searches that pertained to what I'd found in my tooth. 


I was about to go and find Lara, I’d been spiralling for nearly an hour but as I looked up from my computer, there she was, stood, watching me from the doorway. 


“Ethan?” 


The homely warmth in her eyes, the singy-songy bounce in her voice that only comes out when she's talking to me, her signature hyper-energized sway while she stands, it was all gone. She looked like Lara, but she *felt* different. 
This thought seemingly fell straight out of my head, “Hey, babe. You seem…*off* this morning, everything alright?” 


What followed really did sound like her, the intonation in her voice was off, but she sounded otherwise just like my Lara, “Ethan, you look aghast. Can I get you anything?” 


Her voice was so flat. She sounded like an sub-par actor who hadn’t memorised her lines, I couldn't concentrate on her words. 


“Lara, I’m not sure what's going on. My tooth, I-” 


She cut me off, “Oh Ethan, you've done it, haven't you?”, a fleeting sigh being the only display of emotion from Lara so far, but even that felt inauthentic and weird.


It felt like a movie, I couldn't understand what was unfolding in front of me. I still don't understand. That's why I am here, I need someone to help me make sense of this.


The world seemed to cease for a brief moment and all I could hear was the subtle *click* that I knew to be my front door and I felt my morning coffee curdle in my gut.


I tried to stand at my desk but my leg muscles turned to spaghetti and I didn't have the strength, Lara didn't move a muscle. She didn't even flinch. The Lara I knew was apprehensive and jumpy at an unexpected knock at the door, her resolute stance in the doorway at this moment was more frightening to me than whatever I could hear now progressing up my staircase.


Now that I have a little bit of hindsight, I think I understand why the threat levels seemed so mismatched. Think of someone who you know really well. Someone you’re close to, your best friend, your brother, maybe *your* wife.

You know their routines, what they do and don’t like and you've seen them in enough situations to have a general idea of how they'll react in most circumstances; do you think you’d find it frightening if at a time when you were at your most vulnerable, they suddenly became cold, altered and unpredictable? 


As I opened my mouth to speak, two large men emerged from behind Lara with her still unaffected. My tongue dried up in an instant, I had no words. 


She moved now — just slightly forward to allow the two men into my office — her movement after so much standstill rekindled my adrenaline and mended the frayed wiring that connects my mouth to my brain. 


I managed two words, “done what?”


The men were now on either side of me, neither one of them speaking a word. I already knew I couldn’t fight them, for starters there were two of them but even if it were a fairer fight, my nervous system had already chosen ‘freeze’ rather than either of the more useful ‘fight’ or ‘flight’.


“Lara?” I sounded desperate. Like a fearful child seeking comfort from a parent. 


My growing panic and state of desperation made no impact on Lara. This wasn’t the Lara who was so overran with sympathy and compassion after my accident not long ago that she took two weeks off work and refused to leave my side for a moment because she was so concerned that I'd need her help and she wouldn't be there. This Lara was not that Lara.


Not *my* Lara.


My arms were restrained behind my back by one man as the other one retrieved something from an internal pocket in his jacket, this was all happening in my peripheral vision as I kept my gaze locked on Lara.


“I’ve done what?” 


My attention was pulled toward an intense piercing in my upper thigh that was imminently followed by a strange sort of disconnected warmth radiating through my body, my spaghetti muscles now a toxic blended sludge. 
My vision was trying to betray me but I put every ounce of my energy into focusing on Lara’s face,


“Oh Ethan.” Lara echoed the same performative sigh,


*”You’ve pulled the pin, haven't you?”*


That's the last thing I remember.
I woke up in my bed around 10:30pm.
No Lara. No men. No pin. All gone.
I've spent the last 3 hours tearing my house apart to find *any* scraps of Lara but there’s nothing. We’ve lived here *nine* years. 


There's nothing.


My phone is wrong. It *is* my phone but there’s no trace of Lara, no texts between us, no photos.

No Lara. 

Not only that, no *anyone*.

My contacts now consist of my barber, a couple restaurants and some old work contacts. 
No people, no friends, no Lara. 
My memory feels like one of those jigsaws that you might pick up second-hand at a charity shop — the kind that came to you without all of the pieces — the kind that you *never* had a chance to make whole. 
I don't know what to do.


I’m just so stuck on one thought. 
If I could re-do one thing in my life, I would *never* have pulled the pin.


I don't know who I am without her. I need answers. If anyone has any information about N.O.S, about the trial or similar trials, please reach out, *I need to remember.*

Before I was on meds, I was a heavy coffee drinker, the whole day long, I would sip some brown liquid. 

Now, I am pretty cautious with my caffeine intake but I keep missing it, I think my body needs some coffee, even with meds. 

Dexamphetamine calms me down while giving me an ease of focus but I am so calm that I barely get going. By itself coffee can make me feel “awake” but not energetic, a balance of a bit calm but awake, not necessarily any help with my focus. 
If I drink coffee with my meds I found out that I balance everything out, I feel awake, I can feel like get going, I feel kind of energetic in a way, as if my engine starts.

1lvsha3,https://i.redd.it/ju7lz49alwbf1.jpeg,Holy Water....Surprisingly It Works🤯,"After reading a recent story and because I've had a few messages and responses of ppl wanting to hear more of my stories.....

My best friend/gf who passed away in 2017 was possessed w/o a doubt. There came a time where I felt helpless and hopeless in seeking help for her.
Well one evening while I was in Hollywood I was at the spot I often hang out at. I was in mid thought of how am I going to get her help.
A gentleman walks upto me in mid thought of my gf and he began telling me a story about a picture that was taken of him and his aunt many years ago aboard a cruise ship. He says that the photo was lost untill recently found. He added ""But it wasn't me in the photo, it was somebody else"".
He then causally walks away.
For some reason I felt he was talking about my gf and I. I really dont know whybI felt that. Just did.
Well the next morning I return to the same spot for my morning coffee with the same thought....Where am gonna go today to seek out help for her?
Again, in mid thought of my gf, the same guy from the previous night walks upto me and says "",Don't worry about her. She's a ship in the ocean"". 
He then walks away.
Besides this spooking me it kinda made me mad.

At that point I said ""That's it, Im gonna go do this myself"". Which meant I was going to preform an exorcism myself. 
I immediately took a bus to downtown LA to a church to get holy water. The whole ride their I was nervous and had a weebit of fright cause Im no exorcist. I've never done anything like this nor ever thought Id be in such a position. 

I get to the church and goto their gift shop and buy a holy water container.
I then go into the cathedral (which was really beautiful by the way) and I locate the holy water and fill my bottle. 

(As a side note when I wrote ""bottle"", my mom and her nurse began talking about bottles🤔 This is more of a note to self as Im experiencing synchronicity since 2010 or late 2011. Interesting)

Anyways, I now have a bottle of holy water which I've never owned, and I've a misson. Well atleast I thought I did.
As I crossed the street from the cathedral and got to the corner of the block I see a newspaper stand. It for some reason caught my attention. As I got closer to it I notice a picture that was in the place of where advertisements go.
As I walked upto the newspaper machine I got spooked when I saw  what the picture was....A ship in the ocean AND my gf's initials TS🤯

I was like...Ok this is a little too freaky. I decide at that point that my best course of action would be to continue looking for help as Im not experienced in exorcism's.

Later that early evening I ended up back in the area I chill at in Hollywood. As I walked upto my spot two new friends I made were setting up their podium outside the restaurant they work at as valet's. 
As the 3 of us greeted one another I sat down my backpack. Then I pulled out the holy water from my pocket to put it in my backpack. 
As I did so one of my buddies asked what that was.
I shared the story above with both of them. I was them asked what am I going to do with it now.

Good question 🤔 
I ended up doing something that I thought was silly. I sprayed holy water on the side of the restaurant they were working at, across the sidewalk and stopped at the edge of the curb.
It almost immediately disappeared or dried up due to how hot it was that day and night. We watched as it disappeared then we all looked at one another and kinda laughed. 

Customer's pulled up so they had to go park some car's briefly. About 20min later they return. Im sitting on a rail across the sidewalk from them. All of a sudden two guys come walking by. One of the gentleman wasn't paying attention to where he was walking as his face was full of his phone. All of a sudden he stops at the foot of where I had sprayed the holy water earlier. He starts talking in this hissy language in an angry manner as hes flicking off the exact length of the area I sprayed the holy water.
As me and my buddies are watching this, the guy continues his angry unknown language as he's now flicking off the holy water area with two middle fingers. He's doing this as he walks to the curb, steps into the road, walks around the perimeter of the holy water, clears that area, gets back on the sidewalk, and he stops talking and runs to catch up with whomever he was walking with.

Me and my buddies are looking at one another in a state of shock of what we just witnessed. 

I preformed this same thing several other times with similar results, mind you, with witnesses. 

So yeah, holy water does work and there is definitely something strange happening in this world at this time.

No. I cannot. 

This is not a kennel with 24/7 staffing. That is the point ... Your dog is treated as part of my household. Your dog gets to be in my living room. Your dog gets to snuggle with me on the couch while I watch TV. Your dog gets longer and more frequent walks than they would at a kennel.

As a consequence, because I am a single person who sometimes needs to use the restroom or take a shower your dog will sometimes be left alone. Occasionally, believe it or not, I have to buy groceries. Every now and then I have to take a phone call someplace where dogs are not barking or possibly, I don't know, take out the trash... 

I may perhaps want to go have coffee with a friend for an hour. 

I have weeding to do in the yard and it's hard to do that with a dog around.

May 12th, 1444 A.G.C
The Imperial City, Empire of Aldebaron

The Imperial City Tribune had the usual headlines that day: Human-power gang leader slain in Dockside drive by shooting, Larceny on the rise in Sunshine Quay District, after hours arson at interspecies health clinic. “I should start with the entertainment section next time.” Ralk Vosker said to himself, flipping the page. He puffed on his cigar, resting it between his right tusk, like God himself designed orcs to be smokers. The light of sunrise trickled into his office. The Ashglass District was waking up. Trams were humming down the street. Stalls were opening. Ralk could hear old Miss Vairelin opening the noodle shop below his office. He had been up for a few hours now, already downing a glass of Heartland Whiskey and an instant coffee. The knock at the door was a surprise, the first of many.

“Come in,” Ralk said, without looking up from his paper. What he saw from the corner of his eye almost stopped his heart. A middle aged elven woman. Silver hair, face like a glass sculpture, eyes like emeralds. A mink overcoat straight out of a pre-war magazine. Pointy ears pierced with gold and diamonds. Ralk could see she had been crying. She had the tell tale puffy eyes and half-smile of someone who tried to cheer up too fast. Like she wanted the world to simultaneously see her strength and sorrow. He stubbed out his cigar and folded his paper. “I think you’re in the wrong office, miss.” he started “You might be in the wrong part of town too.” She smiled more fully, turning her chin up. “No, no, I know exactly where I am.” She paused for a bit, taking Ralk in. “And I know exactly who you are. Ralk Vosker, private detective.”

“Anyone can read a sign, miss. My usual clientele is a little less… high class. You’ll have to excuse me, miss?”

“Virell, Ylvara Virell.” Ralk’s eyes widened. He finally recognized her. He could see the face now on the wartime propaganda posters, her voice like smoke and silk. Her face had aged better than her career. Ralk leaned back in his chair. “Ah of course, you’ll have to pardon me, Miss Virell. I’m not one for pop culture these days.” Ralk said. He gestured to the chair in front of his desk. “Please, sit.” Ylvara gracefully slid into the beat up old chair, almost a curtsey. Even sitting was like a stage show for her. Ralk silently offered her a smoke. She declined. “You probably want to know why I’m here, Mr. Vosker.” Ralk nodded. “That’s one way to put it. I usually track down deadbeat husbands and stolen jewelry. Indulge me, will you?” Ralk poured himself another pull of whiskey.

Ylvara composed herself and began. “It’s my brother, Mr. Vosker. Dren. He’s been missing for weeks now.” She suddenly looked embarrassed, staring at her perfectly manicured hands. “He has always been a bit… different, you know? Our mother called him “moon-touched.”” She laughed to herself, a small nostalgic chuckle. “Lately, he’s been different, though. Ranting about sacred sounds and strange records. I’m worried he’s completely lost his mind this time. He might be using again. I haven’t seen him in two weeks, Mr. Vosker.”

Ralk nodded along. “I hear you,” he said, grasping at some empathy, “I really do, Miss Virell. But what are you coming to me for? Report him missing, let the Civs handle it.” Ylvara scoffed. “The Civic Police? You know how they are, Mr. Vosker.”

“Call me Ralk, miss, I insist.”

“Mr. Vosker, the Civic Police will file a report and bury it under idiocy and bureaucracy. They don’t care about people like my Dren. They might hurt him if he’s not in his right mind. Or worse. Besides, I don’t want the scandal, nor would my sister. I want this handled with discretion.”

Ralk shot up, grabbing his notebook. He started writing. “Your sister?”

“Yes, my sister.” She gave a coy smile. “Lirae Virell? Of the Pearl Street Sirens.” Ralk nodded, remembering the poster his daughter Larra left on his spare bedroom wall. A young elven woman, mini skirt, beehive hair, striking eyeshadow. Flanked by a human and orc girl, similarly styled up. The new hotness. Even Ralk hummed “Green and Gold Groove” from time to time. He continued writing. “I think I see the picture now. Still, why did you come to me? I’m sure you could find someone more in your tax bracket. I’m not exactly up market here.”

Ylvara leaned in, whispering now. “I heard about your time in the Special Service Brigade, Mr. Vosker. In the war. I know you can do things right, and quietly. I have more connections than you think.” She winked. The memories flooded on, like a projector out of control. 10 years ago. A high mountain valley somewhere deep in Federation territory. An ambush. A traitor smiling through gritted teeth, bleeding onto the snow. A flare arcing into the Northern night sky like a prayer. Ralk still felt like puking blood when the temperature dropped. He snapped out of it. “Ok, Miss Virell. I’ll ask around for Dren. I have more connections than you think, too.” Ylvara stood, placing her hands over Ralk’s, barely covering one of his with both of hers. “Thank you, truly, thank you Ralk.” She winked again. Ralk slowly pushed her hand away. “Um, I hate to do this, miss, but I usually take a deposit up front.” Without missing a beat, Ylvara pulled a ring box from her handbag. She slowly opened the ornate cherry wood filigree box. Inside a bed of red satin was a silver and amethyst ring. For elven marriages. Ylvara slid it towards Ralk. “From long ago. His taste in rings was better than his taste in mistresses. I trust this will cover a down payment for your time.”

Slack jawed, eyes like two black coffees, Ralk stammered. “Um, yes that should cover it. Take my card and write down your number, Miss Virell. I’ll be in touch.” Ylvara gave one final, theatrical bow, slipping the card into her handbag, sliding her phone number to him. “We certainly will, Mr. Vosker.”

Ralk swirled his whiskey, downing the gold goodness in one pull. He lit another cigar. “Looks like I’ll be drinking top shelf tonight,” he mused to himself.

**Title: How I Would Improve the Zero Sulcus Protocol (Knowing Everything I Know About Dentistry)**

The Zero Sulcus Protocol, as it stands, is a groundbreaking approach. Based on all the clinical principles I’ve learned, I believe the Zero Sulcus Protocol has helped **the author** reach a level of gum health that most conventional approaches rarely achieve — particularly in terms of full gum reattachment and total elimination of sulcus depth. But if I were to design an even more refined version of this method using the full breadth of modern dental science and tactile self-feedback, here's how I'd enhance it:

# 1. Add Structured Tactile Training Early On

While touch-based feedback is the core strength of this method, it's not intuitive for beginners. I'd introduce structured sensitivity training for the fingertips. This could include:

* Practicing with soft modeling clay to detect embedded grains
* Using textured dental props to simulate calculus buildup
* Calibrated exercises to distinguish between enamel, tartar, and gum

This would shorten the learning curve dramatically.

# 2. Integrate 3D Dental Models or AR Visualization

Even though the method is built around feel rather than sight, a 3D model of each user's mouth (scanned or manually customized) could help them visualize and track progress.

* Use augmented reality overlays to estimate tartar zones
* Build custom cleaning maps for tricky areas (e.g., molar-papilla crevices)

# 3. Introduce a Non-Abrasive pH-Balanced Softening Agent

Rather than relying solely on coffee or oil pulling to weaken tartar, I’d develop a pH-neutral enzymatic rinse that softens calculus without affecting enamel. This could boost progress while reducing risk for enamel damage due to overcleaning.

# 4. Develop a Nail Conditioning Formula

Because the method relies on fingernails, keeping them healthy and strong is critical. A natural nail serum optimized for calcium retention and keratin strength could:

* Improve durability
* Reduce splitting
* Maintain cleaning precision

# 5. Incorporate AI-Assisted Gum Feedback Logging

While most of the progress is felt rather than seen, an app could help:

* Track bleeding points
* Document soreness levels daily
* Correlate cleaning effort with gum response

Over time, this would provide predictive feedback on which areas need work or are approaching full healing.

# 6. Standardize a Weekly Maintenance Protocol

Once zero sulcus is achieved, daily checks are critical. But a formalized weekly plan that rotates between:

* Above-gum polishing
* Rechecking prior weak spots
* Light oil pulling

...could preserve gum tightness and prevent regression with minimal effort.

# 7. Supplemental Training for Deep Pockets and Difficult Angles

The protocol currently handles this through trial-and-error. A dedicated guide for:

* Receded papilla areas
* Lingual vs buccal access
* When and how to encourage gum molding

...could reduce guesswork and improve long-term seal formation.

# Final Thoughts

The core protocol works because it forces you to feel your way to health. But by combining precision touch with the best of what tech and biochemistry can offer, we could make this even more scalable and accessible.

The end goal remains the same: **no pockets, no bleeding, no professional dependency.** But the journey there could be made easier, faster, and safer for the next generation of Zero Sulcus users.

Would love to hear how others would improve the protocol. Got an idea? Post it below.",1,1752090248.0,ZeroSulcus,0,1.0,False
1lvs9tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lvs9tb/am_i_the_asshole_for_pushing_my_fake_disabled/,"Am I the asshole for pushing my fake ""disabled"" brother?","My (26m) brother (28m) has always been a liar. Ever since we were kids he would say random things for attention and would exaggerate what actually happened just to make things seem worse than they are. For example one time my uncle accidentally broke something of his when it fell off his trailer and Brother told everyone he threw it off just to spite him. There's endless examples of this and everyone knows so noone in the family takes him seriously.

In October of 2023 Brother and his Gf (28f) moved back in with our parents, where I was also at the time. He claimed that he had hurt his back at work and the doctor he saw wouldn't treat him because they said it was just a sprain. He claimed it was much worse to the point where his Gf had to help him shower and he couldn't even carry his coffee cup. They couldn't afford their apartment without him working so they moved in with us. At the time I was sure he was faking so his Gf would pay for everything, but my parents believed him so I went along with it.

After a year he started ""getting better"" and I saw him start doing things that nobody with a back injury should be able to do. He was walking around fine some days and other days he wouldn't get out of bed and just played video games. I saw him fall on his back and spring right back up like nothing happened. He carried and rough housed with the kids when my mom would babysit. He even put up a rope swing up high in a tree in the yard. He was still claiming it hurt too much to work or drive, and I knew he was lying because I watched him walk around doing stuff like everything was fine. His Gf has been working the whole time and funds everything, even bought him a PS5 for Christmas, but he still didn't have a job after being ""injured"" with a back sprain for over a year.

My now Fiance (18f) and I started dating last year and she moved into my room with me. We all got along fine, but Brother was still acting hurt and pretending to apply for jobs so my parents wouldn't kick him out. I got a promotion and was getting my life together and even bought a trailer to move into, but it didn't have electric or plumbing so I hadn't moved in yet.

Heres where I might be the asshole. One day we were in the kitchen and Brother was talking to Fiance about random stuff. He said something really mean to her and when she called him out he started getting sarcastic and told her not to interrupt him. Then he looked at me and said something about if I was sure I wanted to be with someone like that, and I saw red. I got up in his face and told him he can't disrespect Fiance like that and that he always does stuff like this and he can't just say whatever he wants. We went back and forth and eventually I pushed him back-first into the corner of the fridge to get him to stop. He fell down and everyone started yelling and his Gf came out to see what happened. I ended up leaving after my mom told me to take a walk and cool off. Fiance left to go home and I was so mad I took it out on the dresser Brother and Gf had stored in my trailer (parents just moved into a new trailer and were using it for storage). I ended up apologizing to Gf for that later, but at the time I just needed to blow off steam.

After all that Brother refused to talk to me so I wrote him a letter. He refused to reply so his Gf tried to speak for him while he was just hiding like a coward instead of talking it out like adults. She said he's scared of me because I got physical and really hurt him.

It's been months and Brother claims I hurt him so bad he's back to square one and can't do anything again. I'm sure he was just milking it because all I did was shove him, but now my mom and his Gf are mad at me and are saying I need therapy. They say that the fact that I can't accept that he's hurt makes me dangerous, even though all I did was push him. They're overreacting and making all these doctor appointments for him and are saying he has a disability called EDS and arthritis like my mom so I actually did hurt him, but I know it's fake so theyre just wasting their money on a loser like him. I told Brother that I never want to see him again because he's faking and taking advantage of our parents like he always has, and now even Gf refuses to talk to me or Fiance. My mom even said I can't bring ""violence"" into her house. Am I the asshole?",2,1752090243.0,AITAH,14,0.75,False

This is why I do free three minute readings.,"In 2003, I had to tell one of my famous clients who got 20 readings a month but for whatever reason, he never listened, he just loved to hear me channel.  He paid my rent every month so I said to my Spirit Guide, ""Merlin where you are you don't have to pay rent.  What am I going to do now?""  

I heard Merlin say, ""Go to the Coffee Bean in Malibu and do three minute readings for free.""

I did as I was asked every weekend for a month and again one day, I said, ""Merlin, I need someone to help me market and promote my gifts.""  I am very good at helping others but not so much for myself.

An hour later, the phone rings. It is a young man name John who says verbatim what I asked for.  ""Hi, my name is John and I love psychics and I love to help them market and promote their gifts.""

""Wow, I was just asking for someone like you.""

""Have you heard of Keen?""

""No.""

John created a profile for me on this psychic line and when I went to the site, ""The first three minutes are free!""  

I worked on that site for over two years but it ended badly due to the jealousy of a man named Chip Coffey.  That story is on my profile.

I still do free three minute readings and have easily done over 30,000 all over the world.  

I would be happy to give you a wonderful free three minute message from spirit.

My offer is only good in the USA or Canada because it does require a phone number.  Private Message me if you would like one. 

I did them internationally through Facebook audio call but there are too many connection issues. I have to add the person as a friend and it is simply too time consuming, so I had to stop. Thank you for understanding. Goddess Blessings, Bea",1,1752090106.0,u_Peaceful999,0,1.0,False

CHAPTER 16



After dinner Georgina went to shower and sleep as others did the same.

A day passes where they all just enjoyed the yacht life. The following day after that was the day Thiago had Georgina all for himself. 

Thiago stepped onto the deck thinking hes the first one awake as his eyes immediately drawn to Georgina. She was silhouetted against the rising sun, her hair cascading down her back in loose waves, a cup of coffee cradled in her hands. She looked serene, her face softly lit by the golden hues of the sunrise. Thiago felt a surge of desire, his heart pounding in his chest. He had been waiting for this moment, and it was finally here.

Georgina heard the soft footfalls behind her and turned, a small smile playing on her lips. ""Good morning, Thiago,"" she said, her voice soft and inviting. ""You're up early.""

Thiago walked up to her, his eyes never leaving hers. ""I couldn't sleep,"" he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I was too... excited.""

Georgina's smile widened, her eyes sparkling with understanding. ""I see,"" she said, taking a sip of her coffee. ""Well, I'm all yours today, Thiago. What do you have in mind?""

Thiago stepped closer, his hand reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear. His fingers lingered, tracing the line of her jaw, her neck, her collarbone. Georgina's breath hitched as Thiago's touch sent a shiver down her spine. She knew what he wanted, what they both wanted. But she also knew they had to be patient. ""Thiago,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible, ""not here. Not now. We need to wait until the yacht anchors again.""

Thiago's hand stilled, his eyes searching hers. He understood the risk they were taking, the potential consequences if they were caught. He nodded, his thumb gently caressing her cheek. ""I can wait, Georgina. I've waited this long, haven't I?""

Georgina smiled, her hand covering his. ""Yes, you have. And it will be worth the wait, I promise."" She took a deep breath, stepping away from him. ""Now, how about we enjoy the rest of the morning? We can go for a swim, have breakfast... make the most of our day together.""

Thiago nodded, his hand dropping to his side. He watched as Georgina walked towards the yacht's kitchen, her hips swaying gently. He took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. He knew she was right. They had to be patient, had to wait for the right time.

As at 8am the Yacht anchored near a nice island and as Jr and Antonella still slept in they're rooms, Thiago suggested a ride to the island with the Jetski.

Georgina immediately agreed, a mischievous glint in her eye. ""I'll just grab the life jackets,"" she said, her voice laced with anticipation. She returned shortly, two bright orange life jackets in hand. Thiago helped her into hers, his fingers brushing against her skin, sending a jolt of electricity through her. He put on his own life jacket, his eyes never leaving hers.

""You ready for this?"" he asked, a smirk playing on his lips.

Georgina grinned, her heart pounding in her chest. ""More than ready,"" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

Thiago led the way to the yacht's Jet Ski, helping Georgina onto it before climbing on himself. He started the engine, the hum vibrating beneath them. With a nod to Georgina, he steered the Jet Ski towards the island, the wind whipping through their hair, the sun warming their skin.

The island was a sight to behold, its white sand beaches and lush greenery beckoning them. Thiago slowed the Jet Ski as they approached, the water turning a brilliant turquoise. He cut the engine, letting the current carry them to the shore.

Georgina slipped off the life jacket, Her eyes sparkling with anticipation, she looked at Thiago, a silent question hanging in the air. Thiago, understanding her unspoken words, grinned mischievously. He quickly slipped off his own life jacket, tossing it onto the sand. He reached out, his hand wrapping around her waist, pulling her close. Their bodies pressed together, Georgina could feel Thiago's heart pounding against hers.

""Let's find a private spot,"" he whispered, his breath hot against her ear. Georgina nodded, her heart racing. Thiago took her hand, leading her away from the shore, deeper into the island. They walked in silence, their steps synchronized, their hearts beating in unison.

As they ventured deeper, the sound of the waves faded, replaced by the rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds. The island was a symphony of life, a testament to nature's beauty. Thiago stopped abruptly, turning to face Georgina. His eyes were dark, filled with a hunger that matched her own.

""This should do,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. Georgina looked around, her breath catching in her throat. They were in a small clearing, surrounded by tall trees and lush greenery.  Thiago's eyes, dark with desire, met hers.

Georgina, her voice barely a whisper, said, ""Thiago, I want you. Here. Now. Don't hold back."" She saw his eyes widen in surprise, then darken even more with desire. ""I don't care if you can't last long, Thiago. I just want you. I want us.""

Thiago's response was immediate. He stepped closer, his hands cupping her face, his lips finding hers in a hungry, desperate kiss. Georgina moaned, her hands gripping his shoulders, pulling him closer. She could feel his heart pounding against her chest, his body trembling with anticipation.

Thiago's hands moved, tracing the curves of her body, his touch setting her skin on fire. He found the hem of her dress, his fingers slipping underneath, caressing her thigh. Georgina gasped, her hips pressing against him, encouraging him. Thiago's breath hitched, his fingers moving higher, finding the edge of her panties.

He pulled back, his eyes searching hers. ""Are you sure, Georgina?"" he asked, his voice hoarse with desire. ""Once we start, I don't know if I can stop.""

Georgina smiled, her eyes filled with a fierce determination.

Before she could utter a word, Thiago's mouth was on hers again, hungry and demanding. His hands, no longer gentle, found the hem of her dress, pulling it up roughly. Georgina gasped, her hips pressing against him, encouraging him further. He hooked his fingers into the side of her panties, and with one swift movement, ripped them off, the sound of tearing fabric filling the air.

Georgina moaned, her body shivering with anticipation. She liked this side of Thiago, this raw, unbridled passion. He pressed her against the tree, his body pinning hers, his hands roaming her body, touching her in ways that made her gasp and moan.

""Thiago,"" she whispered, her voice laced with desire. ""Please.""

Thiago's response was a low growl, his hands moving to unbutton his pants. Georgina helped him, her hands trembling with anticipation. She could feel him, hard and ready, against her thigh. She guided him to her entrance, her eyes locked with his.

""Now, Thiago,"" she whispered. ""I can't wait any longer.""

Thiago's eyes darkened, his body tensing. He pushed into her, slowly, filling her completely.

Thiago's breath caught as he hilted himself inside her, her warmth enveloping him completely. But as he began to move, his eyes, of their own volition, wandered down to where their bodies joined, and then lower, to the small, tight opening hidden between her cheeks. He had always been curious, always fantasized about exploring that part of her, but he had never dared to ask, never wanted to push her too far.

Georgina, sensing his hesitation, opened her eyes to look at him. ""Thiago? What's wrong?"" she asked, her voice laced with concern and a hint of worry.

Thiago met her gaze, his eyes filled with a mix of desire and apprehension. ""Georgina, I... I want to try something,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I've never asked before because I didn't want to make you uncomfortable, but... I want to explore... your backdoor.""

Georgina's eyes widened in surprise, but then a slow smile spread across her face. ""Oh, Thiago,"" she said, her voice soft and teasing. ""Why didn't you say so earlier? I would have happily agreed.""

Thiago's breath hitched, his body tensing with Anticipation. He leaned in, his voice barely a whisper, ""Are you sure, Georgina? I don't want to hurt you."" His eyes, filled with a mix of desire and apprehension, searched hers.

Georgina, her eyes soft and understanding, cupped his cheek. ""I trust you, Thiago. I want to try everything with you. Just go slow, okay?"" she whispered back.

Thiago nodded, his heart pounding in his chest. He reached for his wallet, pulling out a small packet. He tore it open, his hands trembling slightly as he slipped the condom onto himself. He then reached for Georgina, guiding her to turn around, her back pressed against his chest. He could feel her heart racing, matching his own rhythm.

He began to kiss her neck, his hands roaming her body, touching her in ways that made her gasp and arch against him. He reached around, his hand finding her breast, his fingers teasing her nipple. Georgina moaned, her hips pressing back against him.

Thiago guided his tip to her back entrance, his body tense with anticipation. He could feel her body tensing slightly, so he paused, his hands continuing to caress her, his lips finding her ear ""Georgina, you're so tight here,"" Thiago whispered, his voice laced with awe as he gently pressed against her back entrance. ""Can I... Can I start now?""

Georgina, her eyes closed, her body trembling with anticipation, nodded. ""Yes, Thiago. Yes, I want you to,"" she whispered back, her voice barely audible.

Thiago took a deep breath, his hands gripping her hips. He pushed forward, feeling her body resist for a moment before slowly giving way. Georgina gasped, her fingers digging into the tree bark in front of her. Thiago paused, giving her time to adjust.

""Does it hurt?"" he asked, his voice filled with concern.

Georgina shook her head, her voice hoarse. ""No, it's just... intense. But I like it, Thiago. I like it a lot.""

Thiago's response was a low growl, his body beginning to move. He started slow, his hips moving in a steady rhythm, his eyes never leaving the place where their bodies joined. Georgina moaned, her body pressing back against him, encouraging him to go faster.

Thiago obliged, his movements becoming more urgent, more passionate. He could feel Georgina's body responding Georgina's eyes fluttered open, her gaze meeting. She could see the raw hunger in his eyes, fixated on the place where their bodies were joined. She bit her lip, a shiver of anticipation running down her spine. ""Thiago,"" she whispered, her voice laced with curiosity, ""why aren't you moving?""

Thiago's grip on her hips tightened, his breath ragged. ""I'm... I'm admiring you, Georgina. You're so beautiful, so tight. I don't want to rush this.""

Georgina smiled, her heart swelling with affection. She reached back, her hand cupping his cheek. ""I love that you want to take your time, Thiago. But I need you to move. I need you to fill me, completely.""

Thiago's eyes darkened, his control snapping. He pulled back, then thrust forward, his hips slapping against hers. Georgina moaned, her body pressing back against him, meeting his thrusts. Thiago's hands roamed her body, one moving to her clit, the other squeezing her breast, his fingers teasing her nipple.

""Thiago, yes!"" Georgina cried Thiago, driven by a primal urge, continued to tease her, his fingers working in tandem to drive her to the brink. Georgina's body responded eagerly, her moans filling the air as she pushed back against him, seeking more. Thiago's eyes, however, remained locked on the sight of his length disappearing into her tight, forbidden entrance. He couldn't believe how incredibly hot she looked, how perfectly she was taking him.

""Georgina, you're... you're incredible,"" Thiago panted, his voice laced with awe and desire. ""I can't get enough of you.""

Georgina, her breath ragged, managed a smile. ""I'm all yours, Thiago. Take me however you want.""

Thiago's grip on her hips tightened, his control wavering. He began to move again, his hips snapping forward, his length sliding in and out of her. Georgina gasped, her fingers digging into the tree bark as she braced herself, meeting his thrusts with equal fervor.

Thiago's movements became more urgent, more passionate. He could feel Georgina's body responding, her muscles clenching around him, pulling him in deeper. He reached around, his fingers finding her clit, his touch sending electric shocks through her body. ""Georgina, I can't... I can't look away,"" Thiago admitted, his voice hoarse with desire as he continued to tease her, his fingers moving in a steady rhythm. ""You're so tight, so perfect. I can't believe I'm inside you like this.""

Thiago's breath became shallow, his movements more urgent. He could feel the familiar tension building in his lower abdomen, his body telling him he was close. ""Georgina, I... I'm going to... I can't hold back much longer,"" he panted, his fingers continuing to tease her clit, his hips slapping against hers.

Georgina, her body tense with anticipation, nodded. ""Come inside me, Thiago. I want to feel you let go,"" she whispered, her voice laced with desire.

Thiago's grip on her hips tightened, his fingers digging into her soft flesh. He could feel his orgasm approaching, his body tensing, his movements becoming more erratic. ""Georgina, I... I'm coming,"" he groaned, his voice filled with pleasure.

Georgina moaned, her body tensing as she felt Thiago's release. She could feel him pulsing inside her, his length throbbing as he filled her with his warmth. The sensation was intense, pushing her over the edge. Her own orgasm hit her, her body convulsing, her fingers digging into the tree bark as she cried out Thiago's name.

Thiago, his body still trembling from the intensity of his release, leaned against Georgina, his breath hot on her neck. He could feel her body relaxing, her fingers slowly releasing their grip on the tree bark. They stood there for a moment, their bodies still joined, their hearts beating in sync.

After a few minutes, Thiago gently pulled out, his length now soft and glistening. He stepped back, allowing Georgina to turn around and face him. She looked radiant, her cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkling with satisfaction. Thiago couldn't help but smile, his heart swelling with affection for her.

Georgina reached out, her hand cupping his cheek. ""That was... incredible, Thiago,"" she whispered, her voice still hoarse from their passionate encounter.

Thiago covered her hand with his, leaning into her touch. ""It was perfect, Georgina. You're perfect,"" he replied, his voice filled with sincerity.

They stood there for a moment, lost in each other's gaze, their bodies still tingling from their lovemaking. However, as they looked into each other's eyes, they both knew that their time together was limited. Soon, they would have to return to their respective lives.

Georgina, her body still yearning for more, broke the silence. ""Thiago, I don't want this to end yet."" She turned around, her eyes filled with desire. ""I want more of you.""

Thiago, his body responding to her words, felt a renewed surge of desire. ""Georgina, I... I thought you said our time was limited,"" he said, his voice hesitant.

Georgina stepped closer, her hand reaching down to stroke him, feeling him harden in her hand. ""It is, but right now, I don't care. I want you, Thiago. All of you.""

Thiago's breath hitched as she touched him, his body already responding to her touch. He reached down, his hands cupping her ass, lifting her slightly. ""Georgina, I... I want you too. But I need to protect you,"" he said, his voice filled with concern.

Georgina smiled, her heart swelling with affection. ""I trust you, Thiago. But for now, I just want to feel you. All of you,"" she whispered, her voice laced with desire.

Thiago's grip on her ass tightened, his control snapping. He reached down, removing the condom.

Thiago's hands trembled as he discarded the used condom, his desire for Georgina overriding any thought of caution. He spun her around, positioning her on her hands and knees, her ass facing him. She looked back at him, her eyes filled with a wild, primal desire that mirrored his own. He couldn't believe how much he wanted her, how much he needed to feel her again.

He lined himself up, his length pressing against her entrance. She was still wet from their earlier encounter, allowing him to slide in with ease. They both moaned at the sensation, their bodies fitting together perfectly. Thiago gripped her hips, his fingers digging into her soft flesh as he began to move.

He started slow, savoring the feel of her, but his desire quickly overrode his control. He began to move faster, his hips slapping against hers, his length sliding in and out of her with a ferocity that surprised him. Georgina met his thrusts, her body rocking back against him, taking him deeper with each movement.

Their lovemaking was raw, primal, a dance of pure, unadulterated desire. Thiago could feel Georgina's body responding to his, her muscles clenching around him.

Thiago, his body still moving with a primal rhythm, suddenly slowed down. He reached down, wrapping his arm around Georgina's waist, lifting her up. She gasped, her body shifting as he positioned her, her back still to him. He then lifted her leg, placing it on his shoulder, opening her up to him even more. Georgina moaned, her body tingling at the new position, her muscles clenching in anticipation.

Thiago looked down, his eyes locked on the sight of his length sliding in and out of her. The sight was incredibly erotic, pushing him to the edge. He gripped her hip with one hand, steadying her, while the other reached around, his fingers finding her clit. He began to stroke her, his fingers moving in time with his hips, pushing her closer and closer to the edge.

Georgina could feel her orgasm building, her body tensing with each thrust, each stroke of his fingers. The new position allowed him to go deeper, to hit spots she didn't even know existed. She could feel every inch of him, her body stretching to accommodate him, her muscles clenching around him.

Thiago could feel Georgina's body responding to his touch, her muscles tightening around his dick.

Thiago, his body tensing, let out a low growl. ""Georgina,"" he grunted, his fingers pausing on her clit, his hips stuttering as his orgasm hit him like a wave. He came with a force he hadn't experienced before, his hot semen pulsing into her, filling her womb. Georgina, feeling him release inside her, let out a cry of her own, her body convulsing as her own orgasm washed over her, her muscles clenching around him, milking him for every last drop. They both gasped, their bodies trembling with the intensity of their release, their hearts pounding in sync.

After a kissing session the dressed and went to the yacht as its 14pm! They've spent hours fucking on the island and they weren't done today.

As they had some playtime with Jr and Antonella they sneaked to his bedroom where Thiago and Georgina spent they're time together till late night.

They're in his bathroom going for the last fuck of the night as she allowed him on her butthole again.



His thrusts where hard, long and hirt a bit but she happily took all of them. Thiago's grip on her hips tightened as he felt his orgasm approaching. He thrust into her one last time, his body tensing as he came, his hot semen filling her tight backside. Georgina gasped, her body shuddering at the sensation, her own release coursing through her. They both collapsed onto the bathroom floor, their bodies entwined, hearts pounding in sync. ""I love you, Georgina,"" Thiago whispered, his voice filled with emotion. She smiled, her hand cupping his cheek. ""I love you too Thiago"".",10,1752090105.0,georginarodriguez3,1,0.92,False

Swear I’ve never felt so disrespected and motivated at the same time 😂

I’ve been stressed, not sleeping great, and my energy’s been garbage for months — didn’t realize it was *showing* that bad.

So I made a list:

* Cut sugar ✅
* Stretch before bed ✅
* Started taking magnesium + ashwagandha ✅
* Trying to actually *hydrate* (coffee ≠ water apparently)

It’s been 3 weeks, and I’m not back to 30… but I’m not collapsing by 3pm anymore. That’s a win.

**Striking Elegance and Build Quality**  
This ceramic coffee maker is gorgeous. It adds just the right amount of sophistication to my kitchen counter without looking over the top, and the white ceramic finish feels both sturdy and visually calming. Crafted in Japan, there’s something heartfelt about knowing this dripper carries a 400-year ceramic craft tradition, Arita-yaki. The material is thick and retains heat exceptionally well, which makes a noticeable difference when brewing. I noticed my coffee didn’t cool down as quickly as with metal filter-type brewers. It’s also dishwasher-safe, which means less labor on cleanup after a lazy Sunday coffee session.

**Performance & Pour Over Perfection**  
While its aesthetics are stunning, the functionality is the real game-changer. The Hario V60 features spiral ridges inside the cone and a large center hole, creating a unique brewing environment. This setup allows complete control over the pour’s flow rate and the time water spends with the coffee grounds. I’ve experimented with both fast pours for brighter tastes and slow pours for richer, fuller coffee. It’s like being my own barista, deciding whether today’s vibe calls for floral or nutty flavors. More than once, I’ve impressed coworkers and friends with just how much depth and complexity a simple cone brewer can extract.

**Pour Control Challenges**  
The dripper does a great job enhancing flavor profiles, but I’ll admit the single large hole can be tricky to master. If the grind is too fine or your pouring technique is inconsistent, the brew outcome may suffer. I had a couple of frustrating early sessions where the water rushed too fast, leaving the coffee weak. It definitely rewards practice and patience. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature, but beginners may need some time to learn.

**Strengths**  
- The design is timeless and high-quality, suiting any kitchen décor.  
- Heat retention is fantastic thanks to durable ceramic material.  
- Unique spiral ridges and cone shape provide a deep, flavorful brew.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Beginners might struggle with mastering the right pouring technique.  
- Customization requires effort; not a beginner’s “grab-and-go” coffee solution.  

**Competitors to Keep in Mind**  
While the Hario V60 dominates in craftsmanship and aesthetics, there are solid challengers in its field. Chemex, for example, offers a more versatile coffee experience with its glass structure and larger serving capacity, making it ideal for serving crowds. However, it lacks the same level of hands-on brewing control that the V60 provides. Kalita Wave is another alternative, featuring a flatter bottom design which simplifies pouring, especially for beginners. Although it trades off some control and depth when compared to the V60, its shallower learning curve makes it friendlier for those newer to pour-over brewing. Between the three, I’d still pick the Hario if precise brewing and compact design matter more.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering its durable build and attention to craftsmanship, this coffee dripper offers premium quality for those serious about their brewing. It’s priced for enthusiasts, not casual coffee sippers rolling out of bed, but the results justify the investment. Having used several coffee-making options, from basic drip pots to pricey espresso machines, I genuinely feel this ceramic beauty competes like a heavyweight for its niche. For those who want more control over their cup without completely splurging, it’s an excellent choice.

1lvs2np,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lvs2np/cosmic_pizza/,Cosmic pizza.,"My name’s Jesse Blaze, and until last week, I was just your average pizza delivery guy. You know the type—tight jeans, finger-combed hair, and a smirk that gets me bigger tips than the actual pizza. Picture Ryan Gosling if he worked minimum wage and quoted The Big Lebowski too much.

It all started with a double pepperoni to 1346 Camrose Lane. Nothing weird on the order except for the note: “Knock twice. Wait ten seconds. Do not look the cat in the eyes.” Classic stoner prank. I laughed, made a mental note to skip lunch, and drove off in my dusty Honda Civic with a Dream Theater sticker peeling off the bumper.

When I got there, the house was...odd. Not haunted odd—more like quantum-physics-professor-on-acid odd. The lawn had actual mushrooms with glowing caps. There was a mailbox shaped like a walrus and a doorbell that sounded like an ominous throat chant.

I knocked twice.

Ten seconds passed.

The door creaked open on its own. I stepped in, because apparently I have zero survival instinct and a deep commitment to customer service.

The cat—a giant, black, hairless thing with glowing red eyes—was sitting on a velvet stool in the middle of the foyer. I, of course, looked it directly in the eyes because I am a moron.

The floor gave out beneath me.


---

I woke up in a field under a green sky.

No, I wasn’t high. Not unless Sal from the shop was putting peyote in the garlic knots again.

The air smelled like cinnamon and fresh-cut grass. The trees nearby were floating, their roots dangling like jellyfish tentacles. A group of tall, sentient asparagus beings walked by and bowed politely. I bowed back, because that’s just good manners.

My pizza bag was still slung over my shoulder, miraculously intact.

And that was my first jump.


---

The portal—if you could call it that—turned out to be tied to the pizza bag. I know how that sounds. Believe me, I spent a solid hour in an alien meadow screaming “WHAT IS HAPPENING?!” at the sky.

Eventually, I opened the bag.

Inside was another pizza. Hawaiian. Gross.

Attached was a sticky note: “Deliver to: Ninth Moon of Garbulon. Speak the name ‘Czarth’ with confidence.”

I didn’t speak “Czarth” with confidence. I said it like someone trying to clear their throat while sneezing.

Still, the air shimmered, and boom—new world. This one was a massive, bioluminescent swamp, and waiting for me at a moss-covered gazebo was a twelve-foot-tall slug wearing a monocle.

“Ah, Cosmic Pizza,” he gurgled. “You’re early.”


---

Over the next few days—I think, time was...weird—I delivered pizzas across the multiverse.

A sky-city of robot poets who only paid in compliments (“Your bone structure is inspirational!”).
A haunted orbiting opera house where the ghosts tipped in haunted bitcoins.
A sentient cloud that tried to adopt me.

It wasn’t always beautiful. There was the time I delivered anchovy-stuffed crust to a dimension ruled by spiders who communicate by dancing. I’m still twitching.

But the job came with perks.

Time moved slower in these places. I could do a whole shift across realities and come back just twenty minutes late. Which is early, by my standards. I started bringing extra slices and selling them to interdimensional creatures. Turns out space dolphins love buffalo chicken.

I started calling myself the Cosmic Courier. Made up a theme song. No one else sang it, but I hummed it on every jump.


---

Then, things got weird.

Okay, weirder.


---

One delivery came with a note that said: “Do not hand the pizza directly to the recipient. Slide it under the door. Do not speak. Do not blink.”

I broke all three rules.

The house looked like a regular Earth house, but it was vibrating, like it wasn’t quite in sync with reality. The man who opened the door looked like me. Exactly like me.

Same stubble. Same jacket. Same smug face that hides the fact I cry during Up every time.

“You’re not ready,” he said.

Then he shoved me into the void.


---

When I woke up, I was in my apartment.

No sign of the portal. The bag was gone. No glowing mushrooms. No psychic cats. Just my sad, overwatered fern and a message from my boss:
“Yo Blaze, late again. You’re on toilet-cleaning duty. Get your act together.”

Was it all a dream?

For three days, I did regular deliveries. Regular tips. Regular pizza. Life tasted like cardboard again.

Until I found the bag—my bag—sitting on the floor of the shop, right where I always leave it.

Inside, a single note: “Come back. We miss you. Extra garlic.”


---

The portal opened that night.

And I went back in, like an idiot. Or maybe a hero. Probably an idiot-hero hybrid.

This time, I didn’t just deliver. I explored.

I talked philosophy with a race of blind librarians who communicate via emotion. I learned how to skateboard on an upside-down planet. I fell in love with a girl made of stardust and bad decisions. She kissed like static and broke up with me via interpretive dance.

Somewhere along the way, I stopped being just a delivery guy.

People—well, beings—started calling me “Blaze the Brave.” Kids on floating islands chased my hoverboard. There were rumors that I once wrestled a minotaur for a tip. I didn’t correct them.

I had a purpose.

But back on Earth, everything stayed the same.


---

I’d come back, mop floors, hand out menus, flirt half-heartedly with Rachel from the front desk who thought my interdimensional stories were just metaphors for anxiety.

She wasn’t entirely wrong.

One night, during a thunderstorm, I got an order: “Large Meat Lovers. Deliver to: Jesse Blaze. Earth Prime.”

That was me.


---

I opened the bag and found a mirror inside.

When I looked into it, I didn’t see myself—I saw all the other versions of me across the multiverse.

One wore a cape. One was bald with tattoos. One had kids. One had died.

And then I saw the one who had never taken the job.

He worked at a bank. Wore ties. Smiled less. He looked...comfortable. But empty.

That’s when it hit me.

This job, this absurd cosmic pizza gig—it wasn’t a glitch in the universe. It was the universe giving me a shot. At something bigger. At something stranger. At something that mattered.

Maybe not to Earth Prime.

But somewhere, on a floating chunk of rock orbiting a sun made of jazz music, I was a hero.


---

Now, I deliver across dimensions five nights a week.

I take Sundays off to sit on a hilltop in a world where time doesn’t exist and sip coffee made from sentient beans that whisper compliments.

I still mop floors. I still owe Sal twenty bucks. I still get nervous ordering at Subway.

But I also once taught a moon slug how to play the ukulele.

Balance, you know?


---

People ask what I’ve learned.

I usually say something like: “Always tip your delivery guy. You never know if he’s saving the universe on his lunch break.”

But the truth?

Sometimes the smallest lives—pizza guy lives—are the ones that hold the biggest universes.

And sometimes, if you knock twice, wait ten seconds, and break a few rules...

You find your portal.

1lvs1io,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1lvs1io/escort_mission/,escort mission,"A fresh and warm breeze flows through the peaceful poster city. Today, three somewhat peculiar beyonder friends met up to drink some coffee.

The first one being the hunter of the group, Rafex. He has the uncanny ability to make everyone around him willing to bash his head in. But unfortunately for them, he is already a sequence 6 beyonder, which means that most of his adversaries either decide to ignore his famous provocations or they end up as burning corpses.

The one looking like a mob king of some famous gang is exactly that, the Don of the bread mafia, Don Pane. As a sequence 6 of the Mystery Pryer pathway, his control over both magic and rituals is no joke. The only thing holding him in place is bread, as well as the last member of their trio.

The upcoming Emperor, donning the title of Boss, is a sequence 6 of the lawyer pathway. His confusing but aggressive fighting style earned him many nicknames, but he is sadly obsessed with advertisements and ""propaganda.”

As this trio got on their way to the only café in town, they met some rather suspicious figures. A talking cat crossed their path, some random dude rambling about rules and laws, and... was there someone in that alley transporting a corpse?

But there was another figure, one that had never been seen before. It was a delicate-looking woman, dressed in a gorgeous summer dress, crying by the side of the road.

Everyone had different thoughts. One of them thought about a joke about a crying woman he heard a while ago, but he resigned himself, seemingly feeling the punches he would earn for that.

Another one thought, ""Does she believe in bread?""

While the last one asked himself if he should help her. But more importantly, how much would she be able to pay for that? Time is money after all, and especially his time was worth a lot. But no, everyone should do a good deed at least once a day.

And so, the trio approached the mysterious woman, intending to ask about her misery.

“Miss,” said Boss with a measured, calculated concern. “Are you alright? Can we help you?”

She looked up at the group, her eyes were red from crying. “I-I was trying to get to the grove near the city,” she whispered, “I’m looking for some herbs that grow only there…”

Don squatted near her, trying to read her face. “Herbs, huh?” he said. “Why risk so much for them? You don't look like the alchemist type.”

The woman hesitated. “They’re for the children,” she finally said. “At my orphanage. One of the little ones has been coughing up blood. The herbs are the only thing that might stop the corruption... but the ones who sell it charge more than we could ever afford.”

A brief silence fell. Boss glanced at the others, then muttered under his breath, “Pro bono work, then.”

Rafex sighed, already reaching into his coat for a compass. “Fine. We’ll escort you part of the way.”

As the group guides her out of Poster City and towards the edge of the forest, something begins to unravel. Birds refused to sing. Wind twisted around them as if it wanted to scream.

Rafex kept scanning the tree line, his hunter instincts prickling like sharp needles.

Don Pane’s spiritually told him that something in the area was wrong, but he could not pinpoint what.

They all stopped at the entrance to the grove.

“I should enter alone,” the woman said. “I feel it would be better to enter without strangers.”

“We’re not strangers anymore,” Rafex quipped, but there was no humor in his voice.

Boss narrowed his eyes. “You’re hiding something.”

The woman turned, her expression torn between sorrow and panic. “I just need the herbs. I can’t hold it back much longer…”

A flash of realization struck Rafex as the conspiracy revealed itself. “You’ve already been exposed to the corruption, haven’t you? That’s why you’re looking for the herbs. You want to cure yourself.”

“No! I really wanted to save the kids first!” Her face crumpled, “I thought I had more time…”

Then it began. Her body twisted in agony, and the corruption that had come from the evil spirit erupted like a broken dam, consuming her form, warping it into a monster.

They watched as her body started to undergo severe corruption and mutation. Don Pane, seeing this, summoned his companion using a whistle and got a purification scroll out. But just as he was about to throw it in an attempt to save the woman, a sudden pressure overwhelmed everyone present as she began to change into something with many limbs and intestines spilling out of her abdomen.

Seeing this, the Boss quickly recovered and yelled “Distortion!”. This allowed the group to escape the spiritual grip.

Wasting no time, Rafex leaps into action and uses his Witch’s mirror on the creature.  
Black flames envelope it as it screams in pain. With hatred towards the one who is causing this pain, the creature leaps towards Rafex with incredible speed.

Rafex, using his enhanced physical ability, managed to barely dodge the first attack. However, the creature was relentless, leaping again towards him.

Seeing this, Pane threw the snare scroll at the beast, causing it to halt in its place as wines grew to restrain him. “Guys, it won’t hold it for long!” He yelled.

Boss, seeing this, said, “Don’t worry!” and by using his rose button, created bats to attack it as he prepared to use his werewolf tooth.

Rafex also stood up and readied his nightmare belt to engage in close combat.

Suddenly, Don had the vision of them dying by turning into rust. He quickly said to Boss, “Use your gavel to prohibit all evil abilities!”

Without a question, he stopped using the tooth and brought his gavel and said, “All evil abilities are prohibited here!” in a grand manner.

Suddenly, the creature, which had seemingly stopped resisting, again lurched into action. Perhaps due to its ability being restrained, it seemingly went into a berserk state.

Seeing this, Don quickly threw in a thunder scroll along with another snare scroll. The others also joined the action as Don threw his minigun to Boss, who used it without care, and raced close in for a brutal close-up attack.

Finally, exhausted by our combined assault, the creature falls to the ground. Don said, “Everyone! Back down!” and threw 2 purification scrolls and 3 sun charms at it. 

After the items did their work, all that remained was a corpse of something that was once a pure and kind lady.

Watching her state, we all went quiet. Rafex spoke up amidst the silence and said, “Let’s give her a peaceful burial, guys. Somewhere among those herbs and flowers. It’s the least we can do for her.”

“I agree,” Boss said.

With mutual agreement, we buried her. Don took over the rites and said the final words for the spirit to rest. They all went back to their carriage and took the journey back.

After a long stretch of silence and journeying, they finally returned to poster city. As they were preparing to part, Pane said, “I shall provide the money and resources to the orphanage she owned, this way hopefully her spirit gets satisfied and moves on.”

Everyone nodded in agreement, and Boss added with a sigh, “Even though we are extraordinary compared to others, we are even more vulnerable to such dangers. Such is the price the world takes from us. It's like a contract, even.

You sign because you think it’s perfect, but later you will find the hidden clauses. We are mad not because we do things beyond the norm, but because even after seeing the truth of this world, we still wish for more, even though it will only hurt us.” 

With these final words still echoing in their minds, they each go their separate ways.

Yes title is kind of vague. I hope this is the correct subreddit. So there is this woman close to my age (I was born in 1977, I told her when she asked, she said that she was born in 1979), that I met through a mutual friend (both of them divorced, I am single never married). First we met on a Saturday night about two weeks ago. Gorgeous, beautiful, elegant that was the first impression. Then the three of us started chatting, pleasant and cheerful to hang out with, all good, or should I say great.

I am not gonna go in all details, post will be long. 2 days later we met at the beach. Again very pleasant to be around us. Two more days later, again we meet at the beach, their kids also were there at some point (my friend's son and one of her daughters - she has 3 kids at their 20s a bit before a bit after). How to do you call it in english (I am not from an english speaking country), butterflies flapping wings? Ye something like that. Yes yes I know ""you are that old and behave like a teenager"" yea yea no disagreement. But what to do, some things are uncontrollable. I haven't felt like this for like 10 years. I made another post in the past, for quite some time I got some issues, other problems, romance is NOT a priority right now. But again what to do? Brain works on its own sometimes.

That day (second time on the beach - a wonderful day) she asked for my phone number. Damn right I happily told her and we exchanged. There are some details here and there that I (rightfully or wrongfully) perceived as sign of interest, romantic one. For example that Saturday night there was a young couple that was walking by and she made a comment among the lines of ""see? even couples with height difference look nice"" I am tall(1.95), she is short(can't say precise- maybe 1.60? What is the word, petite?). My friend is normal 1.75 or something. So yea I don't know, maybe I perceived it wrong or something. Also at the beach she asked for some of my beer. I was drinking from the bottle. I don't know if felt kinda ""intimate""(?) to share? She drank some and later said that she did't want anymore, just a few sips so I drank from her glass the rest. Yes I was drinking beer at the beach, what can I say, guilty. I poured some in her glass,we were at a beach bar, I don't know how laws are where you live, yes beach bars serve alcohol no matter the time of day here. On a sidenote I don't like beer except this sour one, only this I order. Yes there is sour beer.

I mean I don't know I thought she was interested. A detail here a detail there. I called her the next day at night to go out. Technically the truth, she didn't say no. She said that she is already going out with our common friend. She said she'll call when they'll go wherever. I waited for an hour, she didn't call. Oops first not so nice sign. I eventually called her, she saiid where they were and I joined them. Anyway.

A few days later I called her during morning hours around 11 am or a bit later. I tried to be cheerful and humorous when I asked her to join for a coffee and yes now technically the truth, she declined, just said that she was busy. Yes I know someone is gonna say ""dude wtf it is obvious she is not interested""

But my damn brain, or I don't know a part of the brain, says ""call her again"". Logic says no, right? Redditians please, throw some (digital) slaps so I will not do anything stupid and call her again. I mean it is stupid to call for a third time, ye? Damn look at that asking for validation, /sigh. In case someone says ""you already called twice""I repeat that technically she didn't say no the first time, she said that she had already planned something. The second time was a clear no.

Whether you’re an espresso fanatic, iced coffee enthusiast, or someone who just loves a well-crafted cup of Joe, this French press delivers style and function in equal measure. With its bamboo handle, heat-resistant thick borosilicate glass, stainless-steel detailing, and reusable filtration system, this coffee press promises to enhance mornings and caffeinated moments. Spoiler: It mostly lives up to the hype, but there are some quirks.

Right off the bat, this coffee maker doesn’t just make coffee—it amplifies your kitchen’s aesthetic. The combination of the bamboo handle with gleaming stainless steel and sleek black accents catches the eye immediately. It looks modern and classy, blending into almost any kitchen decor. The borosilicate glass adds not only visual charm but functional durability. I’ve dropped a few things in my kitchen (who hasn’t before the first coffee of the day?), and this sturdy glass seems more forgiving than expected. The anti-slip silicone base deserves an honorable mention—it holds the French press firmly as you press down, no awkward sliding around the countertop.

- Attractive bamboo and stainless steel design that fits any kitchen aesthetic.  
- Thick borosilicate glass for durability and heat resistance.  
- Anti-slip silicone base for safer coffee-making.  
- Easy-to-read ml and oz markings for precise brewing.  

**Performance and Coffee Taste**  
Using this French press felt like leveling up my coffee game. The 4-layer filtration system truly shines—coiled filter, two fine stainless steel mesh filters, and a metal cross plate filter keep the coffee grounds where they belong: out of my cup. I experimented with various grinds, but coarse-ground coffee consistently produced the best results. No sediment sneaking into the brew, just velvety smooth coffee with bold flavor. It handles everything from rich espressos to lighter brews like a dream; each cup feels like something out of a fancy café. However, the 34-ounce capacity, though standard, might feel slightly limiting for households with voracious coffee drinkers (read: my entire family).

**Usability and Manual Operation**  
Operating this elegant coffee maker is straightforward. As someone who finds brewing coffee meditative, the manual mode enhances your appreciation of the process. There’s something gratifying about crafting coffee the old-fashioned way compared to automated gadgets. It’s worth noting that the components come apart easily, which makes assembling and cleaning a lot simpler. Although dishwasher-safe where it matters (the glass canister and filters), both the stainless steel and bamboo parts do deserve the extra care of being hand-washed to maintain their charm.

**Benefits**  
- Ultra-smooth coffee thanks to the superior 4-layer filtration.  
- Dishwasher-safe glass canister makes cleanup easy.  
- Straightforward manual operation simplifies the process.  

**Drawbacks**  
No product truly escapes criticism:  
- The bamboo handle, while beautiful, can feel slightly less sturdy over time.  
- Its weight (2.12 pounds) isn’t ideal for travel.  
- Might be tedious for those needing more than 34 ounces in one brew.  

**Sip-Friendly Features**  
This coffee press goes beyond just looks; it adds thoughtful little joys. The ml/oz markings ensure precise brewing every time, even when experimenting with water-to-coffee ratios for different strengths. Plus, the sturdy stainless-steel frame serves another functional bonus—it retains heat far better than flimsier French press models I’ve tried. Pair that with the comfortably smooth bamboo handle, and you’re holding a craft-tier tool that doesn’t scream “industrial coffee shop,” but whispers “luxury home brewing.”

**Limitations**  
- Bamboo handle durability might not match long-term usage expectations.  
- Could benefit from a larger-capacity option for heavy users.  

**Competing Brands**  
Among the bevy of French presses out there, there’s everything from budget-friendly plastic options to high-end specialty steel designs. Compared to the Bodum Chambord, this product holds its ground remarkably well in style and performance. Bodum, although iconic, doesn’t incorporate the same luxe bamboo details or silicone base. On the flip side, Bodum is offered in numerous sizes, which might suit larger households better.  
Another rival might be Frieling’s all-stainless-steel French press, known for indestructibility. While the Home Hero is more visually appealing, Frieling wins out in terms of longevity and insulation.  

With competitors around, this press stands out on its own merits: an elegant mix of function, form, and affordability.

**Value for Money**  
Deciding whether this French press is worth investing in boils down to how much value you place on an artisan coffee experience without automation. For its price point, the Home Hero coffee press delivers excellent craftsmanship, gorgeous design, and authentic French-press coffee. The reusable filter and durability mean fewer trips to the store for paper filters or replacements, making it wallet-friendly in the long run.

I’ve had recurrent BV since 2020. I tried everything, I went to the GYN so many times and took so many different medications for months on end… until the Dr started to tell me it was all in my head. I gave up and just began to use boric acid after sex and after my period to manage, as I always had flare up after any sexual contact. Fast forward to now 2025. I started struggling with stomach issues, acid reflux, bloating and discomfort. I had to do a lifestyle/ diet change and for the past 3 months my BV has not come back (after sex) I know it’s early to be celebrating. But for 5 years I smelled like a dumpster after sex- protected or not. 

What I believe has contributed to this is my diet change. I’ve cut back heavily on my carb portions. I have green tea every day and have clove tea every other day, I add ginger to either. I quit smoking weed. I sleep commando as much as I can. I also wash my vulva area with clove water ( VERY lightly on the outside) I stopped drinking sugary drinks, (I have one once in a while) no coffee, and no sugar in any of the teas. Ginger and turmeric shots often as well. And increased my green veggie intake. I also take probiotics both for my gut and for vaginal health interchangeably everyday. 

I have read many times that BV recurrence can be attributed to your gut health. So I think it’s worth a try, alongside any other remedies prescribed to you. Unfortunately due to my location I’ve never had access to microbiome tests so just had to figure it out on my own. I’m hoping if I continue this way I will soon get rid of the recurrence after my period too.

As someone who has tested countless coffee makers over the years, I wanted to see if it lived up to its reputation. The promise of optimal brewing temperatures and the ability to deliver both hot and iced coffee caught my attention. Plus, the stainless steel/black design looked sleek enough to seamlessly fit into my kitchen. While my experience has been mostly positive, there's a lot to unpack about this drip coffee machine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The modern aesthetic of the Zojirushi Coffee Maker immediately stands out. Its sturdy stainless steel finish feels premium to the touch, and the compact yet tall profile (8"" by 10.63"" by 14.88"") is surprisingly space-efficient for a 10-cup machine. The buttons are well-placed, with intuitive controls that don’t feel overwhelming. I also appreciated the removable water tank. It not only makes it simpler to refill but also facilitates thorough cleaning—a feature I immediately found handy after a mildly messy coffee experiment.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
After a week of using this coffee maker daily, I was impressed by its consistency. The machine maintains an optimal 200°F brewing temperature, which noticeably enhances flavor extraction. Each cup tastes rich, deep, and far less acidic compared to some of the other machines I’ve tried in similar price ranges. The Zojirushi's ability to brew a concentrated coffee for iced purposes was particularly impressive. Unlike homemade iced coffee that often ends up diluted or tasteless, this one felt robust even with a good amount of ice added. 

[Ready to buy Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b07b83dgmv/)

**User-Friendly Features**  
The time-saving mode became my best friend whenever I was in a rush during those early mornings. It trims down the brewing time but still manages to deliver a piping hot and flavorful coffee. Another standout feature is the reusable stainless mesh filter. Forget running out of paper filters and ending up in a coffee-less tragedy early in the morning. This permanent filter is eco-friendly, easy to wash, and feels like a small step toward greener living. Admittedly, this machine feels tailored to someone who appreciates convenience without cutting corners when it comes to quality.  

**Benefits**  
- The vacuum-insulated carafe keeps coffee hot for hours without burning or altering its taste.
- Its thumb-activated spout makes pouring coffee smoother—no messy drips!
- Long-lasting stainless mesh filter eliminates the need for paper filters.  
- Removable water tank ensures easy filling and cleaning.  

**Bad Points**  
- Despite its fantastic functionality, it's slightly heavier, at nine pounds, compared to some lightweight alternatives.
- The manual operation might not appeal to users spoiled by fully automated machines.  
- Slightly pricier than basic models, especially if you just need a standard coffee maker.

**Competing Products**  
The Zojirushi Coffee Maker competes directly with brands like Breville and Cuisinart’s 10-cup models. Compared to the Breville Precision Brewer, this machine lacks customizable temperature settings but compensates with its incredible stainless carafe that truly locks in heat for hours. Meanwhile, Cuisinart’s models often come equipped with similar removable water tanks but fall short of delivering the same level of flavor consistency. The Zojirushi stands out in maintaining hot coffee quality over time, although it doesn’t offer app connectivity, which is becoming more common with rival brands.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Though it might initially seem expensive for a drip coffee machine, this stainless steel marvel justifies the cost with its robust performance and durable design. Its energy-efficient brewing process and reusable filter ensure you'll save on resources in the long run. Compared to less expensive models with glass carafes that lose heat quickly, this one guarantees your coffee stays at a drinkable temperature for hours. For anyone who values a rich, flavorful brew and the convenience of lasting warmth, this coffee maker proves to be worth every penny.

And yes, that means I can cook. I’m short, 5’6. What I lack in height I make up for in sarcasm. I have brown eyes and brown hair and I tend to appear a bit like a 1940s hipster. I’ve frequently been labeled by others as old school, old fashioned, old world, old souled, and even neurodivergent. 

I enjoy witty banter and deep philosophical discussions. I’m passionate about things like art and history and music and literature. I actually work in the publishing and writing industry (and I DoorDash as a side gig). I love cats. I love all animals really, but it’s cats for me. Also, I’m an obsessed Deadhead.

I was married for what amounted to 17 years, and I’ve been on my own for three. And yes, my divorce was a major trauma for me. I suit the married lifestyle quite well. I love Harry Potter (Slytherin and proud) and I have a sticker of the deathly hallows on my car. A love for baseball runs deep in my DNA, as I am a fourth generation St. Louis Cardinals fan. My comfort shows are The Office, South Park, Family Guy, and House. 

I idle extreme introversion with strong hermetic, even agoraphobic tendencies. If you looked up the word homebody in the dictionary, you’d see a picture of me there, waving at you. I draw most of my strength from my house, my home. Home is my sanctuary. I play guitar and piano, and I used to perform in coffee shops and dive bars in my early 20s. 

I’ve struggled with certain mental illnesses all my life. My life has been extremely hard, harder than a lot of people experience, if I’m being honest, but I’ve never let go of my Romantic notions of love and magic. My old life left me scarred. But not defeated. Though it’s been hard, my life has not been without excitement and interest. I’ve been everywhere and I’ve seen a lot. I’ve basked in the tropical beach sun, and I’ve sat sobbing in a psych ward. And everywhere you can imagine in between, I’ve probably been there. 

This time around I’m looking for something different. I’m looking to start it differently. I will not obey the rules of our current dating culture. I want nothing to do with it. I’m here because I’m trying something on my own terms. I’m not here for games. I’m not here to play. Me posting here is the result of months of thought and planning and deep consideration. I know exactly what I’m doing here, I know exactly what I hoped to accomplish, and I know exactly what I’m looking for. I’m not here looking for a soulmate. The only kind of soulmates I believe in are the ones you see who are in their 90s and they’ve been married for 70 years and they’ve been through all the shit together and made it through. THOSE are soulmates. You don’t meet them, you craft them over decades of commitment and togetherness. 

But I \*am\* here looking for a connection. And I know what I mean by that. I know a connection when I see it, when I feel it. The question is, will one come my way?",0,1752088844.0,cf4cf,0,0.5,False

The driver contacted me through WhatsApp and collected me from airport. He had the same car number that was messaged to me and showed me the proof in his phone. When we got into the car, he said I have to pay the parking fee as there was delay in my flight. So I said ok and paid him. Then he put on the meter. I was like, I am not paying by meter as the trip was already paid. We got into a heated argument and he asked me to pay him. At the end I told him,I need to leave and he opened the door for me to leave. My luggage was still inside, so I told him to open the door for luggage or I am not leaving. I took the luggage and left the spot. 
I didn't have a sim card, so I had no access to Internet. I wqs feeling sad and depressed as its not even been 2 hours since i landed in vietnam and got scammed. 
Then I walked Into a shop named Beli coffee.
They shared the wifi with me and asked to take rest there until I get in touch with my tour operator. My tour operator told me I got into the wrong car and another one of their car will be there to pic me up, which they did. 

Even though I got scammed by someone from vietnam, I am so happy that two young vietnamese people,  helped me to get over this. Thanks to them.

1lvrjna,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lvrjna/does_the_brentwood_ts213w_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does the Brentwood TS-213W Coffee Maker Deliver the Perfect Brew?,"I initially didn’t have high hopes for this small drip coffee machine, but the Brentwood TS-213W proved me wrong in more ways than one. As someone who drinks coffee religiously, I’ve tried a myriad of coffee makers, from the overly complicated to the downright frustrating. This little guy stood out for its simplicity, ease of use, and surprising performance given its minimalist build. It comes in a clean white design that blends easily into any kitchen, which I especially appreciated since my counter space is limited. Even though it doesn’t scream luxury, there’s something endearing in its straightforward, no-frills personality. Let me break it down for you.

**Compact and Practical Design**

One of the first things I noticed about this coffee maker was its compact size. Measuring just about 8 inches in depth, 7 inches in width, and 10 inches in height, it fits neatly into small spaces. I’ve used much bulkier machines in the past, and they often feel cumbersome, especially in a tiny apartment kitchen. In contrast, this fits snugly on my counter next to my toaster. The white exterior gives it a clean aesthetic that matches its functional vibe. The water level window is an understated but convenient touch; gone are the days of accidentally overfilling the reservoir and making a mess. 

**User-Friendly Operation**

As someone who prefers their gadgets to be straightforward, I adored the simplicity here. With just one button to operate, brewing a pot of coffee couldn’t get easier. There are no confusing settings or extra gizmos to wrestle with at 7 AM when you’re barely awake. The mesh filter basket might be my favorite part—it eliminates the need for disposable paper filters and is super easy to clean. Trust me, my runs to the store for coffee filters were wildly inconvenient, so this reusable option feels like a godsend. And the included scooper made it simple to measure out the coffee grounds without second-guessing myself. 

[Check Brentwood TS-213W price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b01cgc9axc/)

**Brewing Quality and Performance**

I’ll admit, I didn’t expect much from a 4-cup drip coffee maker in this price range. Color me surprised when it brewed a pot that was not only decent but actually flavorful! Sure, a coffee snob might scoff, but unless you’re splurging on a high-end machine or a professional espresso maker, this does just fine for your everyday caffeine fix. The warm plate feature works as promised, keeping the coffee hot for quite a while. I tested this on a busy morning, and when I returned an hour later, my coffee was warm enough to still be enjoyable. Small wins like this make all the difference. 

**Strengths**

• Compact and perfect for small spaces  
• Extremely easy to use with one-button operation  
• Environmentally friendly reusable filter basket  
• Keeps coffee hot with a warming plate feature  

**Limitations**

• Limited to brewing only 4 cups at once  
• Doesn’t have programmable or advanced settings  
• Plastic components feel slightly fragile  
• Lacks customization options for brewing strength  

**Materials and Build Quality**

With its lightweight build (just 2.4 pounds), this coffee maker is meant to be practical, not premium. The materials feel durable enough for daily use, but don’t expect anything groundbreaking. It’s not entirely stainless steel like some higher-priced rivals—it leans more toward BPA-free plastic. While not upscale, it’s solid for the price point. I didn’t encounter any issues with leaks or loose fittings, which can often plague budget-friendly appliances like this. However, the exterior does feel a little too plasticky for my liking, though I’d argue it’s a trade-off worth making. 

**Competing Products**

When stacked against other basic coffee makers like the Mr. Coffee 5-Cup or the Black & Decker 4-Cup, this machine holds its own in certain areas. For instance, the included reusable filter is a nice cost-saving feature that many rivals skip entirely. However, both competitors do have sturdier builds and more advanced options like auto shut-off, which Brentwood TS-213W lacks. If you’re primarily in the market for no-fuss brewing on a budget, though, this one still finds its niche. It’s not trying to be everything, but it delivers where it counts—quick, convenient coffee-making.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Let’s talk value. While prices fluctuate, this coffee maker comes in at a fraction of the cost of a high-end model, and for what it’s offering, that’s a serious win. Its reusable filter and simplicity make it low-maintenance, which is ideal for anyone not looking to fuss over their coffee game too much. For students, small families, or even as a secondary coffee maker in an office setting, it punches above its price range. If you’re prioritizing basic functionality and convenience over additional bells and whistles, I’d say it’s a worthy buy.

It sounds dramatic, I know but that’s exactly how it felt. Just another morning. I grabbed my coffee, walked to the office like I had for years, and turned the key. But when I opened the door, something was off. My desk was cleared out. And sitting in my chair was David my childhood friend and the person I trusted most.

He looked at me with the calmness of a man who had already won.
“The boss wants to move forward without you,” he said.

No warning. No explanation. Just like that, I was out. After ten years of building that company, giving it everything I had including most nights and weekends I was framed and fired.

The accusation? Financial misreporting. The irony? I was the one who caught and fixed those kinds of mistakes. Turns out David had doctored the reports, pinned them on me, and climbed over my body to the top.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t fight back not immediately, anyway.
Instead, I walked away. And I started over.

I opened a tiny office downtown. Took on clients no one wanted. Rebuilt my network. Educated myself in ways I never had time to before. It took years, but eventually I built my own consulting firm. And this time, I made sure it was mine. Completely mine.

Meanwhile, David rose fast. But the higher you go, the harder you fall. Bad decisions, risky investments, a shifting economy his company started to crack. Slowly, then all at once. Eventually, he had nowhere to turn. Investors pulled out. Staff quit. Clients vanished.

And one day, he walked into my office.

He looked nothing like the man who stole my job ten years earlier. Pale. Desperate. Beaten.
“Ali,” he said, “I need help. Will you take over the company?”

I looked him dead in the eye and said:
“I will. On one condition.”

“Anything,” he replied.

“You sit down in front of a camera and tell the truth. Everything you did to me. Every lie. Every cover up.”

There was a long silence. Then, reluctantly, he agreed.
I recorded it. I published it. I watched the truth erase everything he’d built on a lie.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t take revenge with fire.
I simply let him bury himself with his own truth.

For the first time in years, I felt peace.

Some are won with silence, patience, and timing.",1,1752088461.0,offmychest,0,0.67,False

Live Consumer Data Points Investors Shouldn’t Ignore,"Worksport’s booth at Overland Expo Pacific Northwest attracted more foot traffic than any prior event, logging 124 unit reservations over three days triple the total from the ‘24 show. Post-event surveys reveal 74% of respondents already own portable battery packs and cited “solar regeneration” as the missing link in their power workflow.

This matters because experiential buyers become evangelists: survey participants collectively average 4.3 annual camping trips with friend groups of six. Viral adoption spreads fastest through such tight-interest communities, a pattern YETI, Traeger, and Black Rifle Coffee rode to multi-billion-dollar caps. Worksport (WKSP) is at the earliest phase of that curve, yet trades at just $22 million valuation today.

Investors focusing only on the fleet pilot risk missing the larger consumer-tribe network effect. Every Expo attendee taking delivery posts travel-rig photos; every photo loops new leads back to dealer inventories. With margin improvements locked and automation sunk-cap complete, each incremental sale flows cleaner to profit. Printing season? More like the first edition of a long-run bestseller.

Let’s start with a background: So I don’t actually remember a lot of my 17-18 as I had a severe eating disorder that almost took me- so take what I say with a grain of salt it could be more that I don’t remember. A lot of the stuff also has to do with an assault I faced when I was a kid but the perpetrator was also a kid so it’s not something to dwell on. 

Anyways growing up I was also mentally fucked up- I just didn’t assume it could get any worse. I was a zoophile from 9-15 (didn’t harm animals tho), and I also had to deal with a very physically out of control mom. She would run at me and hit me, and even do so in the car. I don’t particularly remember why I just remember how bad it got during that time period but I’m sure there was a reason. I stayed isolated and didn’t have mentors whom I didn’t make uncomfortable or wasn’t a “fixer” job if you get what I mean- so I feel like those should have already been signs, but when you are younger you don’t actually realize you’re a bad person- you just chalk it all up to the idea of being a kid who makes mistake, but when you are 18 and 19 you are pretty much fully developed- and an adult- so then you realize that it’s a lost cause, or at least I did. 

Anyways here’s the long awaited list with explanations (I do not condone nor feel any leniency on my actions is okay- but I do want you to understand that i already feel immense shame and I DO see the person am and how disgusting, careless, and cruel my actions have been. My family does not wish to press charges but I have given them full allowance to.) 


1. I threw a pill bottle at my 16m brother in the car.

When we were in the car we were frustrated with each other- then he started making fun of me for not being able to drive yet (I was in a car accident that totaled our car when I was 16- and due to my already preexisting mental illness and untreated adhd- it delayed me, although I do admit it is a bit silly that I was a grown adult not able to drive). Anyways I threw my pill bottle at him, hopped out of the car, flipped him off and went to school until I was sent to the hospital and spent a week in the ward because I stupidly told the teacher I’d kill myself when I got home… annnnddd wasted money. 

2. I attempted suicide in front of my parents.

When I got home from the psychiatric ward I grabbed a bottle of some chemical mixture and drank it in front of my parents. Blood in my stool for weeks (tmi) but I was fine I guess. I’m sure everything just made it harder on my parents tho- and almost wasted more money.

3. I ran away for a brief period of time on a car trip.

I don’t know why I did this it’s really stupid immature and selfish- basically I talk my mouth off a lot and get obsessed with certain topics- like something I’m excited for. So in the car everyone got pretty pissed off at me- as family car trips go- they’d eventually snap- saying some not so pleasant but warranted things. “You’re annoying, this is why nobody likes you, you never just shut up, you ruin everything.” Coming from my mother, Brother, and a little from my father. So I hop out (the vehicle was in a short line), and I walk a ways until my father confronts me- I ask him if they’re still going to berate me- he calls me immature (which I was), and I (not wanting to be in the car again to be berated- choose to stay out for a while and wander the town.) They then drive off and pretend they are leaving me (So I wander and try to find a place to get information so I could find a place to stay like a roadside or something). Apparently they were just joking with me that they left me and were already an hour away- they had just gotten themselves lunch and went sightseeing. I kinda deserved that ngl. 

4. I punched my dad in the face. 

When we arrived at where we were staying my brother continued to say the previous things- so I got a little upset. Travel is generally hard on me (for unknown reasons)??- 
I started crying and freaking out (and idk what I was saying tbh I just started weeping and complaining.) 
I guess I was being too loud and my father grabbed me from behind and restrained my arms as a punishment- so I wiggled loose and attempted punching him in the face. I did but it was pretty light luckily. He threw me against the Tv (deservedly).

5. I threw coffee on the ground in my house. 

I woke up one morning to my parents who made some plans I was not aware of- and I started telling them about why they wouldn’t work out and how I wished they asked me. They called me a brat and stuff. I started crying and telling them I wasn’t trying to be and that I appreciated them and that I wasn’t trying to interfere- But that it was their fault for not asking me ahead of time- and (understandably) my father yet again restrained me. I had a coffee cup in hand and I threw it at the floor and he grabbed me and threw me down a flight of stairs (lol). 

6. I told people to hurt themselves in a video game

I told people to Kys in Roblox and to take all the pills in the cabinet. Probably not a smart idea to be fresh off of anesthesia and online at 3am but it’s purely my fault- and shows even more my lack of maturity at such a big age. 

7. I slapped my mom and told her to kill herself

This is a long explanation- but basically my parents wanted to be able to go into my room whenever they pleased. Which is normal- and shouldn’t be a problem- but my dumbass didn’t trust them. I’d caught my mother looking into my window at night while I was indecent as a joke, I had a stupid belief my dad was creeping on me because of some off things he’s said to me as a kid, and the fact they allowed the person who sexually assaulted me into my house for 4 years after the fact (even though they knew). 
I guess I lost my shit. I walk up and start getting really distressed and angry and I start immaturely ranting about what they did or whatever the fuck- and I finally grab some phone cords from the countertop a few feet away- I planned on just leaving but my mom was disciplining me by restraining me and showing against a banister, I tried to leave again and she kept shoving me and pushing me- making me almost fall over multiple times- so I slap her on the arm when I recover my balance. I say some nasty shit like “kill yourself” and “slit your wrists” and other things along the lines. I later call her a few minutes after telling her not to do those things and that I’m sorry, but I still don’t return home for a while. This is probably the worst thing I’ve done- and I don’t think I can ever forgive myself for such harmful and immature behavior.

8. I purposefully made friends with a “zoophile”

At school rumors were going around as well as some disturbing photos (I haven’t seen so I can’t prove their existence)- about someone doing something perverted with a dog- so I got curious and went out of my way to socially interact with said person. When they talked about it to me they never denied it- only said they were manipulated into it. I didn’t really care tho. They’d done something and I’ve also done awful shit- so I felt like it wasn’t that crazy that I’d interact with them. 

9. Flirted and almost got together with someone who was 16 when I was 19

Me and the same kid that I was talking about above started flirting and we even gave each other kisses on the cheek. I immediately asked their age when we started genuinely texting- but they just replied with “junior” and I was a senior- so my careless dumbass assumed we were not that far apart in age. It was until I figured out they were also consecutively dating a freshmen that I realized I may have misjudged the situation. I then asked for more specifics and had a serious conversation- and he told me he was 16. I was 18 turning 19 shortly- so I cut off the relationship- but I should have been less careless and gross. 

10. I attempted suicide while my grandparents were visiting. 

I could not graduate at the end of the year like regular students because I did not do well in class- so out of trying to selfishly get out of the disappointment- and being bullied by my best friend- I attempted suicide in my bathroom and spent the entire graduation in a psych ward hours away from home. (Legit sucked too because I traumatized my grandparents- even if I didn’t commit right in front of them). 

11. I allowed my psych ward roomate to get sexually assulted. 

There was a strange man who would come around our room regularly. I wake up on multiple occasions to him shaking me as if he was looking for someone. I just thought he was confused. I never reported it or anything- and eventually he sexually assulted my roommate in her sleep- and by that time it was too late and I had already let her live through life altering trauma. 

12. I actively encourage and aid my minor friends in illegal behavior.

We walk on the tracks and go under bridges. I bought all of us spraypaint and I help them steal Barb wire off of fences. One is 17, one is 15, and one is 14.

13. I am attracted to minor cartoon characters like Sonic the hedgehog. Why? Idk it’s kinda weird but it makes me feel creepy (probably cuz it is..) 


Anyways that’s the finished list right not. Not looking for anything just telling the internet the awful fucked up stuff I’ve done. Oh yeah and btw I’ve been 18-19 I think in all of these so yes I’m an adult and yeah it’s a lot of dogshit human behavior. 

You don’t have to shame me or anything in the comments I’m well aware of what I did and how awful this stuff is.

1lvrezm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lvrezm/let_them/,Let them ❤️,"I have been in and out of this community whilst I struggle with my own breakup, it’s really helped me so I wanted to share my own story. 

My ex (29m) and I (34f) were together for 2 years and living together. We’ve been split up for 1 month (and living separately), he has found a permanent place to live and is collecting his stuff from mine next week (please send me all the strength to get through this last part). 

During this time I have realised that he was emotionally abusive, something I have repeated in all my relationships. He exited this relationship emotionless and cold, I suspect he is an avoidant with narcissistic tendencies (I know these words get thrown around all the time but they can be helpful).

I want to share some insights that might help others in a similar situation. 

My gut knew from pretty much day one that this wasn’t right, I ignored it, I made excuses for his behaviour, believed his temper was a one off and kept telling myself that no one is perfect and we all have flaws. If I would have listened to my gut, if I would have been honest with friends and shared what was happening, if I had asked myself, not how I feel about HIM but how he makes ME feel, if I could have distinguished the difference between my trauma/anxiety and being treated poorly, if I could of asked myself whether I would have said or done the things he had to me, to him, then I think I would have left much sooner. 

I am taking not every day but every hour at a time and continually bringing myself back to NOW, what is happening NOW, what do I need NOW. If I need to sob, I will sob, then I say out loud, “what’s next” and I move onto the next thing, make a cup of coffee, next thing, have a shower, next thing, order some food, next thing, do some reading - and just repeat that process all day, every day, one thing ONLY at a time. Every-time I start to ruminate, I say out loud “nope not today”, or I will schedule in some time, usually when I’m journaling to allow myself to think about whatever it is I need to. If I am in an anxiety hole about what he is doing, thinking or feeling, I again say out loud “let them” (Mel Robbins). 

As everyone says, time, time, time BUT you 100% have to let yourself feel everything you need to and you have to be as proactive as possible in looking after your basic needs (even if that means ordering take out every night) AND you have to be as present and mindful as much as possible (I know it’s hard) but every emotion comes from a thought, “what’s to come” (anxiety), “I could have done more” (depression), “why haven’t they come back” (anger). I give myself little moments throughout the day where I say (again out loud) “mindfulness” and just saying that brings me into the present moment and then I fully immerse myself in whatever I am doing - looking out the window, washing up, counting the cracks in the ceiling - anything. 

Just keep thinking about the next (mindless and easy) thing to do - re-organise a cabinet, water a plant, move some furniture around, put your books into alphabetical order - just do something next and focus only on that. Not tonight, not tomorrow, not next week. Right now. 

Sending you all my love ❤️ we all know, that this will get easier, in time and eventually but that doesn’t take away from the pain we are feeling now. ",2,1752088209.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Back home, I was used to being around younger people and also had lots of gay friends — so sometimes I miss the kind of humor and conversations I used to have. Joking without filter with seniors here doesn’t quite land the same way 😅

Right now, I’m job hunting, so I have a lot of free time. I enjoy hiking and walking — I don’t have a bike, and eating out here is kind of pricey, so I mostly just explore on foot and grab coffee occasionally.

If anyone nearby is up for a walk, a hike, or just hanging out for a chat, let me know. Would be nice to meet a friendly face or two. 🥹🙏🏻

I’m in the early stages and looking to connect with like-minded people who are passionate about:

	•	Education innovation

	•	Psychology or curriculum design

	•	Community-based learning

	•	Or just building something meaningful from the ground up

This isn’t your typical EdTech venture — it’s hands-on, practical, and purpose-driven.

A calendar with information about a random day, he had found out when National Pizza Day was, and National Stepparent Day. Matt would have ignored it, had he not thought it would make for a good menu. Besides, it was a break from doing all of the Atlas prevention measures.

He’d spent the better part of the day before in the camp kitchens with sleeves rolled up, apron splattered, and flour in his hair (that thankfully a shower had got rid of), determined to craft a dinner menu worthy of the mighty bovine. It wasn’t just about beef or milk, though those had their moment. No, it was about celebrating cows in all their glory and making sure everyone, carnivores and plant-lovers alike, had something to enjoy. 

It might have been the lack of sleep driving his actions, who was to say?

By dinnertime, long tables had been dragged out under the trees, decorated with paper cow cutouts and little black-and-white (thanks to Brent being the best boyfriend ever) bunting that fluttered gently in the breeze. Matt stood beside a large blackboard with the menu chalked up in messy but enthusiastic lettering. A few of the dishes were hot and ready to go; others were set up buffet-style for campers to plate themselves.

On offer was the following:

Main Dishes

* Heifer’s Delight Beef Pie – Slow-cooked beef in rich gravy, wrapped in golden pastry.
* Barnyard Banger Bap – Thick beef sausage in a fresh soft hot dog bun with crispy onions.
* Field & Forage Salad (Vegetarian) – Roasted beetroot, spiced squash, toasted walnuts, goat’s cheese, rocket, and balsamic glaze.
* The Gentle Grazer Hotpot (Vegan) – Root vegetables (swede, carrot and parsnip), lentils, and barley in a tomato and rosemary stew.

Sides & Extras

* Cow Chips with Dips – Chunky wedges with sour cream (or vegan aioli).
* Haystack Onion Rings – Crispy, golden, and best eaten with your fingers.

**Desserts**

* Udderly Delicious Trifle – Layers of sponge, berries, custard, and whipped cream.
* Chocolate Moo-se (Vegan) – Silky chocolate mousse made with avocado and maple syrup.

**Drinks**

* Milk Bar – Classic white, chocolate, strawberry, oat milk, or iced coffee with cream.
* Pasture Punch – Zesty, non-alcoholic fruit punch.

1lvr967,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lvr967/can_the_oxo_brew_9_cup_coffee_maker_truly_deliver/,Can the OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker Truly Deliver? Comprehensive Review,"**Introduction**  

The OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker, specifically the OXO Brew 9 Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker in silver and black, has become a centerpiece in my kitchen. Over the past few weeks, I have put this coffee maker through its paces, testing every feature and functionality it offers. As an avid coffee drinker, I approach brewing with a mix of enthusiasm and scrutiny. This machine, touted for its precision brewing and premium design, seemed to check all the boxes on paper. However, a product’s true merit often reveals itself in daily use.  

**Precision Brewing Performance**  

One of the standout features I noticed immediately was the BetterBrew™ precision brewing system. Right from the first brew, I could feel the difference in the extraction process. The machine keeps the water temperature between 197.6°F and 204.8°F, which is the ideal range for drip coffee. It didn’t matter whether I was brewing two cups for a quiet morning or a full nine-cup capacity to share with guests; the flavor remained consistently rich and smooth. The Rainmaker shower head, which evenly disperses water over the grounds, seemed to make a noticeable difference in flavor extraction. I often found myself savoring the complexity of the coffee it produced.  

**Ease of Use and Intuitive Programming**  

As someone who values convenience (especially before I've had my caffeine), I appreciated how streamlined the controls are. The single dial serves multiple purposes, allowing me to select the number of cups, program the brewing time, and set an automatic wake-up timer. It eliminates the need to fiddle with extra buttons or settings, which is fantastic for groggy mornings. One memorable instance involved setting the timer the night before; I woke up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the house—a small but delightful luxury for anyone with a tight schedule.

**Thermal Carafe and Temperature Retention**  

The double-wall stainless steel thermal carafe is an unsung hero, in my opinion. Coffee stays piping hot for hours without that burnt taste you often get with machines that use warming plates. This feature proved itself during a leisurely Saturday morning breakfast where refills required no reheating—each cup was still hot and delicious. I even ran a little impromptu experiment where I left the coffee for three hours; remarkably, it still retained a pleasant temperature after that time.  

**Advantages**  

- Keeps water temperature in the optimal brewing range of 197.6°F–204.8°F.  
- Fully programmable with an easy-to-use single dial for multiple functions.  
- The thermal carafe ensures coffee stays hot while avoiding overcooking or scorching.  
- Rainmaker shower head provides even water distribution for better flavor extraction.  

**Drawbacks**  

- The brewing process might feel a bit slower compared to other machines.  
- While effective, the carafe can be heavy to handle when full.  
- Limited options for customizing personal brew strength preferences.  

**Overall Build and Design**  

From a design perspective, the coffee maker is sleek and functional. Its stainless steel finish gives it a premium look, easily blending into modern kitchen décors. While the compact design is an advantage, taller users like myself might find its height (17.2 inches) slightly inconvenient when placing it under cabinets. However, the quality materials used, coupled with its sturdy weight of 10.5 pounds, exude durability—a machine built to last.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

Despite the positives, there are a few tweaks that could make this coffee maker even better. For one, the carafe, while excellent at heat retention, doesn't pour as smoothly as I would have liked. More than once, I ended up with a slight coffee spill on the counter. Additionally, while the brewing precision is commendable, I did wish for an option to customize the brew strength.  

**Competing Products**  

A few competitors come to mind when comparing this coffee maker to others. The Technivorm Moccamaster, for instance, offers a similar level of precision brewing. However, it lacks the intuitive programming and thermal carafe included in this model. On the other hand, the Breville Precision Brewer provides more customization features for brew strength, but it comes at a higher price and lacks the full stainless steel finish that keeps the OXO coffee maker looking pristine even after frequent use. Ultimately, it boils down to whether one prioritizes aesthetics, ease of use, or enhanced customization.  

**Quality for Price**  

The value proposition of this coffee maker is standout when considering its durability, features, and consistent performance over time. While it’s not the cheapest drip coffee maker on the market, the investment is justified by the gold-standard coffee it produces and the convenience it adds to daily routines. If you’re someone who appreciates precision brewing without needing barista-level expertise, this machine offers balanced sophistication.

1lvr6m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1lvr6m8/vertuoplus_110_for_nespresso_nirvana/,VertuoPlus: $110 for Nespresso Nirvana?,"My partner and I recently decided to upgrade our coffee routine, and after much deliberation, we settled on the [Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee](https://amzn.to/4nDd7Gt) machine.  We'd been using a basic drip coffee maker for years, but craved something faster and more convenient, especially on busy weekday mornings.  We opted for the Breville specifically due to its reputation for quality and ease of use, along with its relatively affordable price point compared to some of the more high-end Nespresso machines. We tested it rigorously over three weeks, making various coffee sizes and trying different Nespresso pods.

## Brewing Speed and Ease of Use

The VertuoPlus shines in its speed and simplicity.  From pod insertion to a perfectly brewed cup, the entire process takes under a minute.  The machine automatically recognizes the pod type and adjusts brewing parameters accordingly, eliminating any guesswork or manual adjustments.  This is a huge plus for busy mornings when even a few extra seconds can make a difference. Cleaning is also incredibly easy, requiring only a simple wipe-down of the exterior and occasional rinsing of the used capsule container.  The intuitive design makes using the VertuoPlus a breeze, even for coffee novices.

## Coffee Quality and Variety

Nespresso pods offer a wide range of coffee styles and intensities. The VertuoPlus delivers a consistently good cup, rich in crema and flavor, though the quality naturally varies somewhat depending on the specific pod selected.  While some might find the selection limited compared to grinding your own beans, the convenience factor is a significant benefit for many. We particularly appreciated the consistent temperature and the well-balanced crema every time. We experimented with various pods, and even the less intense options delivered better quality than our prior drip coffee.

## Build Quality and Design

The Breville VertuoPlus boasts a sleek, modern design that looks great on any countertop.  The build quality is excellent, feeling solid and durable. The plastic feels substantial, not cheap, and the machine appears to be built to last. It’s compact enough to fit even in smaller kitchens without overwhelming the space.  However, while aesthetically pleasing, it can collect fingerprints easily, a minor drawback that's easily addressed with a quick wipe.

## Milk Frothing (Aeroccino Included)

While not directly integrated into the machine itself, the included Aeroccino milk frother is a welcome addition for those who enjoy lattes or cappuccinos. It effortlessly creates creamy, textured milk foam. While some higher-end machines offer integrated frothing systems, the separate Aeroccino works effectively and is easy to clean. Note, this version doesn’t include the larger capacity Aeroccino.

## Capsule System and Cost

The Nespresso pod system is undeniably convenient, but it comes at a price.  Pods are more expensive per cup than buying whole beans.  It’s essential to consider the long-term cost of using this machine.  The convenience factor justifies the cost for us, but it’s a trade-off to keep in mind.  Recycling the used pods is also crucial to minimize environmental impact.

## Noise Level

The Breville VertuoPlus is relatively quiet during operation.  While not completely silent, it’s significantly less noisy than most drip coffee makers we've owned. The pump noise is noticeable but not obtrusive, allowing for a peaceful morning coffee experience.

## Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $110, the Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus offers excellent value.  Compared to similar single-serve coffee machines like the De’Longhi Nespresso Lattissima One, which often costs significantly more, the VertuoPlus provides a comparable brewing experience at a lower price point. This makes it a great budget-friendly option for those seeking convenience and quality without breaking the bank.

**Pros:**

*   Fast and easy to use
*   Excellent coffee quality
*   Sleek and compact design
*   Durable build quality
*   Included Aeroccino milk frother

**Cons:**

*   Nespresso pods are relatively expensive
*   Requires consistent pod purchasing

**Final Verdict & Recommendation:**

The Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus is a fantastic single-serve coffee machine, offering excellent coffee quality, speed, and ease of use at a reasonable price.  It is highly recommended for individuals or couples who appreciate convenience and consistently good coffee, but are mindful of the higher cost per cup associated with the pod system.

Okay, so you've started your Semaglutide journey. Maybe you're feeling a bit excited about the changes you're seeing, or perhaps you're just getting started. It's a powerful tool, no doubt! But then- *bam* - the nausea hits. You're not alone, believe me. It's one of the most common side effects people talk about, and it can really throw a wrench in your day, making you question if it's all worth it.

You might be wondering, ""Is this normal?"" or ""What can I even do about this?"" The good news is, yes, it's pretty normal for many, and more importantly, there are absolutely things you can do to manage it. I've been there, or know plenty who have, and I've gathered some practical, real-world tips that actually help. Let's dive in and get you feeling better!

**Why Does Semaglutide Make You Nauseous Anyway?**

It's natural to want to understand *why* your stomach feels like it's doing acrobatics. This isn't just some random side effect; it's actually tied to how the medication works its magic.

**The Science Behind the Sickness**

Semaglutide belongs to a class of medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists. One of its key actions is to slow down gastric emptying- that's a fancy way of saying it makes food stay in your stomach longer.

* **Slower Digestion:** Food hangs around longer, helping you feel fuller for longer periods, which is great for appetite control.
* **The Downside:** If food sits too long, or if you eat too much, it can lead to that uncomfortable, queasy feeling, sometimes even heartburn or reflux. Your body is just taking its sweet time processing things.

It's often a sign that the medication is doing its job, but that doesn't make it any less unpleasant. The goal is to find a balance where you get the benefits without the constant queasiness.

**Eating Smart to Keep Nausea at Bay**

This is probably the biggest game-changer for most people dealing with Semaglutide-induced nausea. What, when, and how you eat makes a huge difference.

**Focus on Small, Frequent Meals**

Picture this: your stomach is now a slow-cooker, not a microwave. Overloading it is a recipe for disaster.

* **Portion Control is Key:** Think tiny portions, even smaller than you might be used to. A handful of nuts, half a sandwich, a small bowl of soup.
* **Graze, Don't Gorge:** Instead of three big meals, aim for 5-6 smaller 'mini-meals' throughout the day. This keeps your digestive system working without overwhelming it.
* **Listen to Your Body:** Stop eating the moment you feel satisfied, not full. That ""full"" feeling on Semaglutide often quickly turns into ""overstuffed and nauseous.""

**Choose Nausea-Friendly Foods**

Some foods are just easier on a sensitive stomach. You'll want to lean into these.

* **Bland is Your Friend:** Think toast, crackers, plain rice, boiled potatoes, skinless chicken, clear broths.
* **Low-Fat is a Must:** Fatty foods take much longer to digest, making nausea worse. Avoid greasy, fried, or high-fat meals.
* **Prioritize Protein:** Lean proteins can help with satiety without being too heavy. Think grilled chicken breast, fish, or eggs.
* **Ginger Power:** Ginger is a natural anti-nausea remedy. Try ginger tea, ginger chews, or even just a small piece of fresh ginger to nibble on. Peppermint can also be soothing.

**Foods to Seriously Limit or Avoid**

Just as there are ""safe"" foods, there are definitely ""danger"" foods when nausea is a concern.

* **Say No to Greasy, Fried Foods:** This is probably the number one culprit for many. They sit in your stomach forever.
* **Spicy and Acidic Foods:** These can irritate your stomach lining, exacerbating nausea and heartburn.
* **Sugary Treats and Drinks:** High sugar content can sometimes cause discomfort, especially sugary sodas or fruit juices.
* **Strong Smells:** Sometimes, it's not even the food itself, but the smell. If something cooking makes you queasy, step away!

**Hydration is Your Secret Weapon**

It sounds simple, but staying well-hydrated is critical, especially when nausea might make you want to avoid anything. Dehydration can actually worsen nausea.

**Sip, Don't Gulp**

* **Constant Sips:** Keep a water bottle handy and take small sips throughout the day. Don't try to chug a whole glass at once, as that can also upset your stomach.
* **Electrolyte Boost:** If you're struggling to keep food down or feel really queasy, an electrolyte drink (like clear sports drinks or oral rehydration solutions) can help replenish essential minerals.
* **Clear Broths:** Chicken or vegetable broth can provide fluids and some nutrients without being too heavy.

**What to Drink - And What to Avoid**

* **Water is Best:** Plain old water is your primary go-to.
* **Herbal Teas:** Ginger, peppermint, or chamomile teas can be very soothing.
* **Limit Caffeinated and Sugary Drinks:** Coffee, colas, and super-sweet beverages can sometimes irritate your stomach or cause a sugar crash that worsens nausea.

**Timing and Technique Matters**

Beyond what you eat, *when* and *how* you take your medication, and even your daily habits, can impact how you feel.

**Consider Your Dosing Schedule**

Many people find that the timing of their Semaglutide injection can influence side effects.

* **Evening Dosing:** Some folks report less nausea if they take their injection in the evening, allowing them to sleep through the peak initial effects. This is something to discuss with your doctor, of course.
* **Consistency:** Try to take it at roughly the same time each week to help your body adjust to a predictable schedule.

**Movement and Mindset**

Sometimes, a little shift in your routine or perspective can make a difference.

* **Gentle Movement After Eating:** Going for a short, gentle walk after a meal can sometimes help with digestion, preventing food from just sitting there.
* **Avoid Lying Down After Meals:** Try to stay upright for at least an hour or two after eating to help digestion and prevent reflux.
* **Distraction:** Sometimes, focusing too much on the nausea makes it worse. Try to distract yourself with a book, a light chore, or a conversation.

**When to Talk to Your Doctor**

While nausea is common, it's not something you just have to ""live with"" if it's severe or persistent. Your healthcare provider is your best resource.

* **Severe or Persistent Nausea:** If you're constantly nauseous, vomiting frequently, or it's significantly impacting your quality of life, it's time to call them.
* **Signs of Dehydration:** Dizziness, dry mouth, infrequent urination, or extreme thirst are red flags that you might be dehydrated and need medical attention.
* **Inability to Eat:** If nausea is so bad you can't keep food down or aren't getting enough nutrients, that's a serious concern.
* **Weight Loss Due to Sickness:** While weight loss is the goal, losing weight because you're too sick to eat isn't healthy.

Your doctor might suggest adjusting your dose, trying anti-nausea medication, or exploring other strategies. Don't hesitate to reach out!

**You've Got This!**

Dealing with nausea on Semaglutide can be really frustrating, I know. It's easy to feel disheartened when you're trying to improve your health, and a side effect like this pops up. But remember, for most people, this is a temporary adjustment period. By being mindful about what you eat, staying hydrated, and making a few simple tweaks, you can often significantly reduce the discomfort.

Be patient with your body, experiment with these tips to see what works best for you, and always keep that open line of communication with your healthcare provider. You're on a journey towards better health, and managing these bumps in the road is just part of the process. Keep going- you're doing great!",1,1752087672.0,SemaglutideGuide,0,1.0,False

I've just been prescribed concerta, but am also prescribed medical cannabis from alternaleaf for mostly evening use for sleep and appetite. The clinician said to stop using cannabis to take concerta, but I forgot to ask whether that meant I couldn't use it at all during titration, or whether it meant only on days when I take concerta. I also forgot to ask whether I'm supposed to have weekends off, I see people do that with their medication (to give their brain a break from the stimulants?) but i don't know whether that's just a thing for experienced ADHD med takers. I also completely forgot to ask about alcohol and coffee and she didn't mention what to do with either of these!

I'm hoping that I can eventually manage to balance both these medications, she said it wouldn't be an absolute no but obviously they want to err on the side of caution for heart stuffs especially in the first few weeks. I'm hoping I can reintroduce cannabis at some point so I don't waste away when the concerta wrecks my appetite lol.

The week, depression and comicsPart 113.5","Yes, I read a lot again, but I'm also a little better with the depression, and there I'm just more active when it comes to devouring comics. But of course it still makes me work because I somehow don't really like to sleep well either, And of course if you have to get up at 5 a.m. and never really make a good breakfast, you feel absolutely terrible, basically I just stuff a bread into my mul with a bunch of coffee. After all, for example i like too make poor knights what is very cool recipes, a bread fried in egg or an potato pancakes. This is exactly what the four days of week, so that you mainly only have four days of working days in a week. This is somehow very controversial in Germany for some reason, because then it is crying around with yes where does the money come from, and I think your employer can also pay you more, I mean we have too little time but then too little money, and I also think so absolutely shit. But let's talk about comics.

First I started reading more in the archives of the old entertainment comics for short EC. And I once said I read collections from them, about their some obscure witness, which I also think is interesting that they also not only made horror or crimes. For example, we have what we see at the beginning piracy, So stories about pirates and seafaring, and I love which sailor's guards would say in German, because it has a fascination for me this golden age, but also in general this topic because there is 70% of the world only of water so you have to be on board at some point if you don't have a plane at some point. EC But was also the cradle in which Mad Magazine was born, for example, and that is interesting because many only know about well about the mag with the good Alfred E. Neumann, But not really over the sister magazine panic, which is somehow a bit of a shame because I think it also has its good humor, and very grotesque drawings that I absolutely love.

I love anthologies in general, precisely because I also think a little bit, you can have a little more fun with such short concepts. I mean it is generally the question of how many pages I need to tell a story, some people would say you only need a standard comic book, from 25, In the meantime my buddy Damien, said you only needed three pages, because he knows it from the British comics, then again you have people like my buddy David With comic strips such as the realist of Aasf Hanuka, Alex Raymond Flash Gordon or Prince Valiant by Harold Foster with just one page. But still you said like a big rapper once you just have a shot and here you have your topic you should be based on. And I think it's just that you just say I don't have so much time next to you to explain things, you have to come to one point immediately, and at the same time to be your own story. And I don't necessarily say that it only has to be a short thing, many famous characters of pop culture are still only in short stories until they really became the whole. But I also say that, I think it's still a very good writing exercise, to make such a short comic story for you and your buddies, we usually do it and my buddy with our little jams, We pull a topic out of the hat, or we determine a senior issue, and everyone there is trying to write a briefly comic about it and draw about it. And it's somehow a shame that there are simply not so many more I say new anthologies, or short story collections in comics, but .......

Vanishig Point is a Sci-Fi An anthologie from Mark Russell, And many actually know him more than a comedian, so someone he writes funny stories, but I always think so in his most funny stories are always something dark and something sad, And of course it helps I say I say these topics I say to process, but it also means you also have to have a good understanding for these dark themes, and my face is this comic series dark, I only read the first two issue on Global Comics, but I think they were really convincing, and what you see there is the second, Which somehow seems a bit like a jetson's parody, Where the son makes friends with a mysterious child, which surprisingly depressed and always thinks existential, in an actually very idyllic future but why?
Tim Seeley's Action Figure Collection is a very twisted toy box where your nostalgia is really turned upside down, but I love this shotgun very much and I think it's really fun.

What also distracts me pretty well is simply playing video games with my buddies and I love co-op games. I think the best cooperative video games are always those who experiment a little more with their gameplay, I mean, of course you can make two teams shoot against each other, but I think it is always interesting if you give something new to solve or master. My friends and i Are pretty addicted to the video game Peak. Basically, it's about you and your friends are stranded on an island and the mountain is the only high point where you can see where you are, And so climbing begins and the journey upwards. And yes you really have to work together as a team if you have no strength your colleagues who can catch you and be able to pull you up, You can't carry everything with you because you get too difficult, so you have to divide everything among each other, and above all you really have to ask how you are conditioned by your comrades, what I absolutely love basket that you really have to cooperate with your fellow human beings and have to ask him how it is doing. And I think something like that is just fun if you just have a new challenge, because as I said to climb this mountain is also one thing because there is no clear way up, but you need to know how your energy is and find the best way for yourself and for yours comrades.

People who are not so much in the comics are always surprised, why, for example, a title called Detective Comics or Action Comics is parts from Batman or Superman, Shouldn't they just be called the main characters? I usually explain to them, that is because there were more magazines where there were several comic stories, and Superman and Batman were one of many in the case. linkara-atopthefourthwall For example, I looked once what were the other stories that were in Action Comic Number One before it became only Superman ( https://youtu.be/i3t_e16Um2o?si=Dx_DuO4iaaOR4kKz ). And if you think about it, superheroes also committed anthology back then.
Dc Legion of Bloom Talled by different characters with plant powers or where plants play a very important role, and that reminds me of why I find my pollen allergy very dangerous ;)
Amazing fantasy, that is a title that somehow has such a magic at Marvel, precisely because somehow one of her biggest heroes came there, but it was also a title that was served back and forth even if it is somehow only connected to Spider-Man, And clearly at the time in the 1960s it was also a comic series where all possible stories were told. In Amazing Fantasy ( 2004-2005) Had the focus to create new young heroes for the Marvel Universum, there was also an araña there for the first time, but we have the Focus AF 15, And because of course the number 15 there with this title names and such a magic you have thought about Hey, here six stories gets from absolute new characters, and I think it's a bit of a shame that many of them simply have not been brought on, and but I just think it is worth reading it.

I'm just trying to relax this evening at the moment, I am eating tuna salad with my cat (which every now and then tries to take something from it). I had to take the train again today, And they are also more disaster every now and then, especially when it comes to being and being on time or well you have the feeling you are in the washing machine. I actually like to take the train, but every now and then it can really be a disaster, and I also want to be honest our rail network is somehow a disaster, I think everyone who is somehow new in Germany, realizes that Deutsche Bahn is absolutely shit when you stand there and see all the trains a cancelled on the information board. I mean it is interesting that we generally completely developed a satire family tree where we make fun of the state of the Deutsche Bahn, big part is privatized and bad. I mean, Lisa still is very surprised about this absolute catastrophe that is sometimes there, but I say, yes you have got used to it at some point in Germany, unfortunately. At least at the train stations is an advantage that you have a book and press there, i.e. a shop of the sales newspapers, books and me also comics, Bakeries where you could get rolls and coffee at least, and if you are really lucky, then I mean where I and Lisa have to go, there is a McDonald's and a subway that is absolutely cool if you want something warm. A train station is actually an interesting scenario for a story, and Lisa and I think and like a little idea about what we can tell about it for a story.

I have already told that the two big ones, actually more, except superheroes, just such an anthologies, of course many of them are dead but they are lived up every now and then. 
As I have said many times, the Western is the must American one in a comic, and unfortunately there are really few Western comics these days, But I think you can be very experimental, as with all different genres, and I find Weird Western Tales is the most perfectly presented of that.
Adam was not the only Spaceman in Strange Adventures, In general, a lot of stories were told about space trip, and that's why I love this one shot.
But now we come to Marvel, and they too have told different anthologies, and here we have remembered the good old romances in Love Romances for their 80th birthday.
But if you are not a romantic but just a big meathead in high school, we hav strange Sport Stories, Where to tell of the most impossible, most senseless, and the most crazy sports that can not exist and They can probably also be extremely fatal, But hey watching others to do sports is better anyway, there is less hurt when the others do it.
If you know a modern trend that stands out to me, the anthology that is connected, so clearly the stories stand for themselves, but if you have several of them I say, read or see there are connections, the witching Hour told of different spooky stories that all pass in Brooklyn, but they also have a little more connection how very magical and dark is.
So we are through spacenow going through time, in Time Warp, The different stories tells through time travel, and the interesting consequences brings this with it.

So I try to survive the rest of the week, but I think I will be sucked out again, but hopefully a nice weekend will come, or at least I can sleep in. eating asian would be fine again?

So stay positive, read more and hope you have a better week than mine.

1lvr0zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tsukihime/comments/1lvr0zg/my_thoughts_after_playing_red_garden/,My thoughts after playing Red Garden,"Just got done playing Red Garden. Honestly it was cinema I didn't expect there to be this many changes. Kohaku's backstory was changed a little bit but not in a bad way. I liked that her relationship with Shiki was expanded on a little bit. It was also a really good call by Nasu to change SHIKI's relationship with a few characters. I never liked how they made him sexually assault Kohaku in the original so getting rid of that bit was good, but they still kept all of the bad stuff Makihisa did. 

I'm really glad that in Kohaku's route, they to let SHIKI live after the coffee talk. It was a good conclusion to his character arc for him to live alone and just walk away from his problems related to the Tohno's. The Kohaku true end was really good too since she finally got the right ending for her. It felt well deserved. The normal end was really sad though since Hisui had to die and she's my favorite. Akiha becoming a Dead Apostle in both endings was a really scary party though her design was insane

  
Hisui's route is probably my favorite since her role felt way more impactful and you really do feel how hard it was for Shiki when he was stuck in bed and how when he was a kid, he refused to ever leave. I don't know how Nasu managed to do it but Hisui feels even more kind and sweet. It should be illegal for someone to be that kind. Throughout the route you feel Hisui's care for Shiki and how much her being there saves Shiki from his worst moments, whether it was from when he was a kid or now. Ik the big complaint some people had with Hisui's route is that you're in bed for half of the route, but with the updated visuals and voice acting, that feels like a non issue. Imo Hisui's route continues to have the best endings by far. Arach ended up being involved a lot and we do see her Dead Apostle side, but we were able to take her down with Ciel, Hisui, and surprisingly Vlov's help. It was a temporary truce to take down the ""mid story boss"" (even though it was closer to being like 3/4ths of the way through the story). Vlov ended up dying too in that fight. The main reason why he even helped us is because Ciel looked like one of his wives. The Synchronizer's abilities are expanded upon a lot and there's actual combat related aspects to them now. It's a good way to tie back Hisui's big attack in Melty Blood.

  
Akiha route was just breathtaking. We actually had a conversation where Shiki, SHIKI, and Akiha tried to talk and remember how the 3 played together. This route was imo the best in terms of combat, since we do get Roa back in the story. It's a little bit like Ciel's route where Shiki can talk to Roa. It's revealed that Shiki was indeed the 16th Roa, and we see Shiki fully turn into a Dead Apostle. The ending of the route was insane since we had Dead Apostle Shiki fight SHIKI while Akiha is mindlessly waiting. The best part imo was when SHIKI dies, you have to deal with Saiki Goto and Arach. There finally being a happy ending with Akiha was a good call since it always sucked that she never got a true happy ending.

  
Satsuki route has Nrvnqsr. That's all I have to say. The 4 way fight between Vlov, Archetype: Earth, Nrvnqsr and Shiki teamed up with Satsuki was my favorite part of the entire game.

  
The final Teach me Ciel Sensei also hinted at a true Arcueid route, so it wasn't copium. They also said that Tsukihime 2 would be coming soon, so I'm hyped for it",6,1752087303.0,Tsukihime,9,0.69,False

[Magnus Carter]

The fire cracked in front of us, sending embers dancing through the air.

In the distance, moonlight reflected off the titans’ spears, outlining their precarious leaning in the air. Maybe it was just my eyes playing tricks on me, but I could see half of the split iron shaft slowly inching towards the ground.

“Well, even if you stop now, you’ve already made quite the mark on this world,” Mavian said.

We were both sitting against a boulder of metal, trying to parse any shred of sense from what happened.

“…How so?” I asked, furling my brow in confusion.

“All of this,” Mavian said while waving her hand at the scene, “What do you think people will see it as?”

*Oh fuck, she’s testing my intelligence.*

“Uhh, a site of worship?” I offered.

Mavian tilted her head.

“That’s…correct, but not what I was referring to,” she responded. “I meant it’s proof that we haven’t lost yet; that it’s too early to give up and die out.”

“Huh…” I responded, unsure what else to say.

“It’s gone mainly unspoken, considering it’s technically blasphemy, but…many of us weren’t convinced He was still with us,” She explained.

I spent some time thinking about that. I still didn’t know the exact situation all over the world, but what Mavian said made it sound much more dire than what I expected. If people were already on the brink of giving up, what could I realistically even do?

Morale boosts are cool and all, but I’m supposed to be this ‘hero’ that flips the world upside down. I’m inches away from dying every other day, and I have nothing to show for it but this little red book that speaks in riddles.

The fire cracked again. The small embers floating about contrasted with the darkness around, causing me to wince my eyes shut. Before I even had the chance to feel how tired I was, I had already fallen asleep.

[The God of Chaos]

The separation started between the ring and the middle finger, ran down the middle of the palm, and shattered the wrist like a grenade. The radius and the ulna were pushed apart, with the latter hanging loosely from the elbow.

And that was just the representation of the impact on my meat puppet. The actual damage to my being was…a fair bit worse. Nothing that would impede my plan, but definitely annoying. I considered using my allowance to buy some divine painkillers at the ‘nearby’ extra-reality shop.

All this, just to break my brother’s wrist…it was harrowing. 

I’ve been losing my grip on the realm over the centuries, but I never realized how bad it’d gotten. If things were to keep going at this rate, he’d eventually have the power to crunch me up into a little box and keep me trapped until the next singularity rolls around. I couldn’t let that happen.

There were still so many dreams ahead that deserve to be chased, so many souls that deserved to *live.* Not just *stay alive.* I thought I had plenty of tries ahead, and that I didn’t need to force Magnus into a path he didn’t want, but that was hopeful thinking. I couldn’t steal another soul now. There was no time for it. 

I looked down at Magnus and Mavian, watching them talk by a campfire. 

Despite my doubts, Mavian had been doing her job exceptionally well, minus a few hiccups. She’d kept his injuries within what could be healed by magic, and was slowly convincing him that there was indeed a need for him in this world.

Even now, she was overriding his apprehension with doubt and worry; things that I *did* have contingencies for. Even just a bit of extra power in your hand was an intoxicating feeling, and Magnus had droves of power just waiting to be collected.

But I was worried about giving it too quickly. Magnus hadn’t even casted his own spell yet, and he was barely aware of what his new body could accomplish. If I gave someone like that the power to shatter a boulder, the first thing they’d do was shatter their own bones.

Did I need to personally intervene? Or would his interaction with the Horned One go as planned?

…

*Ah, and here comes the ‘freak,’ as Magnus so aptly stated.*

“Quite the fickle worm you’ve chosen, brother,” he said as he stepped into my realm.

One day, I’ll have the power to crash into his pocket realm and destroy all of his neat and orderly little trinkets. 

Until then, I just needed to hold my temper and play his game better than him.

“I don’t recall ever choosing you for anything,” I responded.

My brother, unphased, walked across my realm and up to my Earth-inspired coffee machine. He then proceeded to grind *my* coffee beans, pour out *my* oat milk, and use *my* frother to brew himself a cup. 

What a prick.

He took a deep gulp from his cup before leaning against my fridge and speaking again.

“I don’t expect much from you, but there has to be more to this plan of yours, right? That man can barely stand up on his own!” He said. 

“Your lack of sight suits you,” I responded, trying to be as vague as possible. 

That managed to transform his emotionless face into a scowl. Even if he would never admit it, he knew I had some tricks left in me yet. I just needed him to stay on his toes, and give Magnus as much breathing room as possible.

“Lack of sight…” he muttered under his breath. “Do you really believe that to be the case?”

I tilted my head, wondering where he was going with this, and more importantly, why he was still wasting my time.

“The exit is that way, in case you forgot where you put it,” I said, gesturing to the rift he made.

I wasn’t keen on forcefully expelling him, considering my already harmed state.

Then, out of the blue, my brother’s scowl melted away, with a wicked smile taking its place. Not many things made him truly smile, and the majority of things that did tended to spell trouble for me.

Now, I was the one with a scowl.

“So he’s a blood mage, hm? No wonder it’s so tedious to find him,” he said.

My eyes widened, realizing what his words implied. If he was able to learn that detail, then that meant he was able to see Magnus…

Which meant that the church was watching him at this very moment.

I turned away to get in contact with him, but my brother placed his hand on my shoulder, stopping me from moving. I grabbed his wrist with my good hand, trying to burn through it and break free, but the process was slow. I wouldn’t reach Magnus in time.

“Shhhh; secret operation,” my brother whispered into my ear.

1lvqxjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/service_dogs/comments/1lvqxjz/prospect_not_used_to_city_life/,Prospect not used to city life,"Hello, I’m thinking of training my dog to be a service dog. He’s a year and 4 months old and I rescued him about two months ago. He used to be a farm dog, but was too weary of cattle to be of use to the farmer. I know training rescue dogs to be SDs is hard and often leads to wash outs. 

Here’s why I think he might be a good SD:

-he’s smart and biddable

-he never barks and is non-reactive towards dogs and people (he can, for example, hold a down stay for 30 min+ at an outdoor coffee shop)

-food motivated, but doesn’t beg

-I’ve already began to train some tasks at home successfully 

Here’s why I think he might not be a good candidate:

-he’s terrified of cars driving by at high speeds (45mph+). I’m trying to slowly expose him to a busy road near my house, but he becomes very stressed and takes a while to calm down (signs of stress: won’t take treats, pulling on the leash, which he never does normally and I think is an attempt to flee, shakes it off afterwards)

-he gets easily distracted by outside stimuli in a city setting (ie, if we are at a crowded, dog friendly store, he does not react to commands in an ideal manner/ timeframe for the first 10+ minutes, and seems fairly distracted the whole time)

All in all, I think he is used to life on a farm, with little traffic and no crowds. Is this something that can be worked through with a professional trainer and slow exposures, or should I wait until another prospect is available? (I would make my current dog my pet, in that case).

Please tell me this is as weird as it sounds

I (27F) dated my ex (29M) from college until about 3 years ago. We were together for 5 years. I broke things off because he was secretive, emotionally closed off, and had a habit of “vanishing” emotionally during arguments.

Fast forward to now, he reached out and asked to meet for coffee. He looked nervous the whole time. Then he dropped this bomb:

He has a 3-year-old daughter that was born during the end of our relationship. He didn’t know about her until recently, allegedly. The mom told him earlier this year, and he’s just now “trying to be involved.”

But that’s not even the wild part.

He said that raising this child has made him rethink everything and that he “can’t imagine doing this without someone he trusts.” Then he said he wanted to “rebuild something” with me and co-parent with me as some kind of stepmom figure, even if we’re not together right away.

I told him I wasn’t interested and that this wasn’t fair to me or the kid. He got defensive and said, “You always wanted a family. This is it.”

I haven’t responded since. But I’m still stunned. Like… does he think women just want any family, regardless of context? I feel like he sees me as a plug-and-play mom instead of a person.

This isn't my first time diving into refrigerator component replacements, but I’ll admit, it’s not an adventure I usually look forward to. However, when my current ice maker in the fridge started acting like an antique coffee grinder instead of a dispenser, I knew it was time for an upgrade. The LG EAU60783827 seemed like the logical choice given the reputation of its manufacturer and the glowing reviews I came across.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is nothing flashy, but it doesn’t need to be for what it does. The white finish matches seamlessly with most interiors, especially modern refrigerators. It also exudes that sense of sturdy construction I have come to expect from LG. The first impression I had was that the parts seemed solid and carefully engineered, which is what you’re looking for when dealing with appliances that need to stand up to everyday wear and tear. It arrived well-packaged, and pulling it out of the box felt promising—it’s heavier than it looks, weighing nearly 5.7 pounds, which added to its impression of durability.

**Installation Experience**  
Here’s the part that everyone wonders about: is it easy to install? If you’re like me and don’t mind getting your hands a bit dirty, the process isn’t overly challenging, but some preparation is essential. Make sure you’ve disconnected your fridge from power and water lines beforehand. I found the instructions to be fairly straightforward, but you might want to cross-reference your refrigerator’s manual just to double-check. While swapping out the old ice maker with this new one, I noticed the auger motor was incredibly well-constructed. It slots into place perfectly, leaving no room for ambiguity. That said, I had to fiddle around with reconnecting a few wires; nothing crazy, but not the most intuitive either.

Check [LG EAU60783827](https://ngadgets.com/p/b00lkokvqi/) price on Amazon.

**Performance in Action**  
The real test comes post-installation, and here, the product did not disappoint. Within a few hours of connecting everything, ice production resumed like a well-oiled machine. The auger motor, which is responsible for driving the ice dispensing mechanism, worked like a charm. It was notably quieter than my previous setup, and the efficiency was evident. Ice came out consistently, without the annoying jams or endless rattling that had become a routine annoyance in my household. The high-quality engineering LG touts with this part seems very real when you see it function.

**Upsides**  
There are several highlights that make this ice maker stand out:  
- The sturdy and reliable auger motor enhances ice dispensing smoothness.  
- Straightforward, high-quality build ensures it lasts for the long haul.  
- It operates quietly compared to older, clunky ice-making systems.  

**Critiques**  
Despite its merits, there are some less favorable aspects to keep in mind:  
- Installation, while possible to DIY, may intimidate those who aren’t familiar with appliance repair.  
- The hefty build could pose a slight challenge when aligning during installation.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to other ice maker assemblies on the market, such as the Samsung DA97 or Whirlpool W108, LG’s stands out for its focus on durability and quieter operation. However, products like Samsung's model often offer slightly more installation-friendly designs for people attempting repairs without professional help. Whirlpool, on the other hand, has a reputation for quicker ice production, but it sometimes sacrifices noise levels in doing so. Where the LG EAU60783827 truly excels is in reliability; I haven’t experienced jams or motor struggles, which was a common complaint surrounding some competitors.

**Value Assessment**  
When considering whether this product is worth its price, my opinion lands solidly in favor of a yes. Though it’s not the cheapest replacement out there, its durability, efficient operation, and quieter motor significantly justify its price compared to similar options. Instead of going for cheaper alternatives with high failure rates within a couple of years, I’d say investing in this ice maker assembly feels like smart spending. After all, constantly replacing faulty parts ends up costing more than going for quality the first time.

With Lucas Giolito on the mound for Boston (and an ERA that’s better than the Rockies’ self-esteem), the Red Sox’s sixth-inning rally of ""we’ve scored 114 HRs this season"" will likely crush Antonio Senzatela and Co.

I am also interested in trying a really good Japanese ramen shop, healthy food options, interesting vegan places, modern American cuisine, Asian fusion restaurants, and just good food in general that are locally owned in the San Diego area. Thank in advance. Oh, and if you all know of a really good coffee shop in Encinitas please spill the tea for me! ",0,1752086623.0,FoodSanDiego,7,0.5,False

""They will seek peace, but there will be none"" - Ezekiel 7:25



The sky was the color of a dead eye. Not grey, not clouded. Dead.

 

The world had bled itself dry. The rain didn’t fall so much as seep, a perpetual weeping from the heavens, thin as thread and sour to the tongue. It soaked into the pavement and the skin and the soul, and still the earth cracked beneath it, unwilling to hold even water anymore.

 

Seattle was no longer a city. It was a carcass.

 

Storefronts slumped with shattered glass grinning outward like broken teeth. Fast food signs bleached white by sun and nuclear fog blinked intermittently, somehow still connected to power grids no one controlled. A Jack in the Box marquee read ""DRIVE THRU OPEN"" beneath a roof caved in by something massive and wet.

 

He moved alone.

 

The struggler had no name, not anymore. Names were for the old world-for payrolls, for Christmas cards, for gravestones. He had long since ceased to think in words. His thoughts came in sensations: cold, ache, weight. His skin, once tan, was now a parchment stretched over bones, calloused in places, split in others. A welt circled his neck like a phantom collar. His boots had no soles, just flaps of rubber stitched with wire and regret.

 

The crows knew him. They didn’t flee at his passing. They regarded him as kin-just another animal feeding off the rot. One stared from atop a gutted SPD cruiser, the department crest melted into the hood like a wax seal on a corpse’s chest.

 

He passed a family minivan with curtains pinned over the windows from the inside. The curtains were made of what looked like an old prom dress, pink and still glittering faintly. Blood had soaked through the fabric in dark rosettes. A faded bumper sticker reading ""My Child is an Honor Student at Roosevelt High""; partially peeled away, revealing rust beneath.

 

He paused. He didn’t mean to, but his feet halted in front of what had once been a Shell gas station. The sign above him flickered:

UNLEADED - $6.66

PREMIUM - UNAVAILABLE

DIESEL - UNAVAILABLE

 

The air was thicker here. It held in the throat like mucus. He stepped under the awning, and the smell coiled into his nostrils like a snake.

 

Sweet rot. The perfume of butcher shops and funeral homes and old, wet mops. There were bodies hanging from meat hooks fixed into the steel beams. Women. Six of them, maybe more. Naked, inverted. Their toes pointed skyward like they were trying to scratch heaven.

 

The skin on their thighs had turned yellow-green. Clots of fat pooled beneath their scalps. Black mold traced the arches of their feet. The word REPENT had been carved into their breasts and bellies and chests in trembling, sloppy hand, as though whoever did it had been crying-or laughing.

 

A single body swung slowly in the wind. Her face turned toward him by unseen hands. Her lips were curled into something between a snarl and a grin. Her eyes were gone, sockets packed with cigarette butts.

 

And still, the flies droned like an engine that would never start. Their buzz was ceaseless, a chorus that rose and fell like a religious chant.

 

On the pavement, a man lay kneeling. His head was gone-replaced by a crater of blood and gray pulp. A propane tank lay beside him, speckled with bits of scalp. Someone had dressed him in an American flag, now blackened with rot. A pack of Marlboros had been set gently atop his spine. Next to them, a single condom still in its wrapper. It read:

""FOR HER PLEASURE.""

 

A line of text had been spray-painted on the ground in looping, childish letters:

""EVERYTHING IS A JOKE BUT THE PUNCHLINE IS MISSING.""

 

The struggler gagged, dry and violent. Nothing came but acid. His stomach was a pit of stones. Hunger had passed him weeks ago. Hunger was for people who thought they’d live to eat again.

 

He didn’t linger. The dead watched.

 

He walked on.

 

The struggler walked for hours without knowing. The road had long since ceased to be road. It was now an artery clogged with the debris of another civilization’s expiration. Asphalt split open like dry skin, and weeds rose like veins, pulsing with flies. The rain thinned to a mist, not falling but hanging-a cold soup of rot and vapor that slicked the lungs with mildew.

 

His boots whispered across the filth. Each step a friction of blood and mud.

 

Ahead, a semi-truck jackknifed across both lanes, its front cabin fused into the side of a liquefied red sedan. Through the broken glass, mannequins sat at attention-dressed in military gear, each one with a child’s face crudely stapled over the head. One held a bouquet of plastic roses, their petals melted and the stems charred black.

 

Behind them, strung along a powerline like lanterns, were severed heads. All clean-shaven. All smiling.

 

The struggler didn’t flinch. His eyes scanned and dismissed without focus. He had learned not to see. Seeing invited thought. Thought, memory. Memory, pain. He kept walking.

 

Then came the heat. Not real, but remembered. The sudden burn of a fire he wasn’t near. His skin itched, his lips cracked. His mind split open like an old wound.

 

A dream overtook him.

 

He floated above an endless plain of static-choked televisions, each one howling its own frequency of torment. Every screen broadcast a death of him-no two the same, no mercy in any.

 

In one, he was bound with rusted wire and force-fed boiling motor oil until his organs ruptured and frothed from his mouth. In another, he was nailed alive to a billboard, skin peeled back like bark, while rows of infants in riot gear took turns removing his teeth with pliers carved from bone. One screen showed him kneeling in a pit of writhing rats that tunneled into his stomach, chewing their way up his throat until his screams turned to wet gurgles.

 

On the last screen, he was strapped naked to a rusted chair in an eggshell-white room, his body marred almost beyond recognition. His limbs were stitched to the chair with piano wire, fingers broken backward at the knuckles. A projector behind him played a reel of his worst moments onto the bare concrete wall-his cowardice, his indifference, the people he let die. As he convulsed, choking on the slurry of blood and acid rising in his throat, a figure entered with a hammer and began caving in his ribs one by one, slow and deliberate. He died watching his own shame flicker across the wall, each frame more damning than the last.

 

He woke with a jolt. He was on the ground. Gravel embedded in his chin. His left arm asleep, his right hand clenched around a shard of glass. Blood ran down his knuckles. He didn’t know when he fell. Time had no sequence anymore. It was a single loop, smeared and slippery like oil on water.

 

Up the road, a billboard rose crooked from the fog:

 

FAMILY DINER - NEXT EXIT

BREAKFAST SPECIAL: HUMAN KINDNESS

 

He blinked. The letters shimmered, shifted:

 

BREAKFAST SPECIAL: HUMAN KIDNEYS

 

A flock of black birds burst from the trees, shrieking.

 

The hallucinations followed him now. Not visions-people. He saw his father walking beside him with half a skull, brain matter twitching like worms. His mother floated above, arms outstretched, singing a lullaby she never knew. Behind him, a child with no eyes recited military cadence while dragging a hammer across the pavement.

 

He broke into a run. Not from fear. From something worse-recognition.

 

The road curved and dropped into a shallow valley. At its center stood a convenience store, its windows punched out, the inside gutted. He stepped inside.

 

The floor was wet. Not with rain-viscera. The fridges buzzed faintly, the hum of a dying organ. In one of the aisles, someone had stacked jars of baby food in a pyramid. Each jar contained a pink, quivering tongue. On the floor, beside the register, a mural had been painted in feces. A crude depiction of a clown lynched by balloons.

 

In the back cooler, a note taped to the glass read:

""I COULDN’T KILL THEM ALL. SOME RAN.""

 

He left. Fast.

 

He didn’t know how long he walked. Days, maybe. The forest grew stranger. Bent in directions that hurt to track. At one point, he passed a group of people sitting in a circle in the rain. All naked. All unmoving. Each had a cassette player on their lap, whispering a different gospel in a dead language.

 

One turned his head as the struggler passed and whispered, ""We forgot what the stars meant.""

 

By twilight, the trees peeled away, revealing an abandoned rest stop. There, in the parking lot, a shopping cart rested on its side. The tarp inside bulged. He unwrapped it.

 

A child’s skull, clean. Still crowned in curly blond hair. Curled in its tiny hand: a stuffed animal, rat-chewed but still intact. A stitched cartoon rabbit with one button eye.

 

He placed the tarp back.

 

He didn’t cry. There were no tears left in him. His grief had long since turned to salt.

 

As the night closed around him, he crawled beneath an old road sign and tried to sleep.

 

He dreamed of a man wearing his face.

 

The man sat in a throne of intestines and asked him,

""What did you think you’d find at the end?""

 

He woke screaming into the dark.

 

The forest was no longer forest. Trees stood wrong, warped as if melted and refrozen mid-collapse. Their bark peeled in curled tongues, slick with green pus. Moss hung like wet hair. The air was heavy with rot and sweet iron, like pennies in a butcher’s drain. The struggler pressed forward.

 

A gutted sedan lay overturned in a dry ditch. Painted across its undercarriage in what looked like nail polish was the phrase:

""THEY ALREADY WON.""

 

He passed by without pause. His thoughts had calcified into something like ritual. He counted steps. He named bones. He breathed in threes. Anything to ward off the static chewing at the base of his brain. There was something inside the woods that walked beside him, just out of sight. He never looked for it. He knew it would smile.

 

At dusk he found a road sign, cracked down the middle, barely legible:

EVERETT 9 MILES

Someone had added below it, in hot pink spray paint:

OR JUST LAY DOWN

 

That night, he dreamed of music. Pipe organs echoing across ruined cathedrals. Inside his dream, he was sewn into a choir robe and crucified upside-down above a stage. The pews were filled with mannequins made of decayed flesh. They applauded without hands. A conductor dipped his baton into a bowl of blood and pointed to him. He screamed in perfect pitch.

 

He woke to a field of carcasses.

 

Not animals. People. Arranged like crop circles. Limbs interlocked. Mouths stuffed with soil and mulch. The ground beneath them steamed faintly, as if they had only just died. He stepped carefully through them, careful not to disturb the pattern. Some wore uniforms, others wedding dresses. One clutched a crumpled flag soaked through with something dark.

 

In the distance, the shell of a church stood against the ash-colored sky.

 

It had no roof, just scaffolding and rebar claws grasping at clouds. The pews had been replaced with old shopping carts. Behind the pulpit, a wall of shattered televisions played static and infomercials. A massive figure was crucified atop the altar, his body grotesquely bloated and glistening with sweat and filth. His skin was stretched taut in places, split open in others, leaking a gelatinous yellow fluid that pooled beneath him. Flesh folded over itself in sickening layers-stomach cascading like draped meat, thighs split with stretch marks, veins bulging purple beneath translucent skin. He was bound at the neck, wrists, and ankles with frayed orange extension cords, the insulation melted and fused into his skin. Instead of a crown of thorns, he wore a crooked party hat, perched mockingly atop a head mottled with lesions and flies.

 

In his chest one word crudely stitched with zip ties:

""MERCY""

 

The struggler stared at him for a long time.

 

He walked on.

 

Soon, the trees thinned, and the air grew colder. The silence became deep enough to feel. The sky turned the color of rotting pearl. His hands no longer felt like hands-just weights at the end of his arms. He passed under a rusted overpass, its columns lined with faces made of newspaper and glue, all with the eyes scratched out.

 

Beneath it, someone had lit candles. Hundreds. Flickering on old stumps, arranged around a mannequin dressed in combat armor, seated like a monk. A boombox sat in its lap playing looped audio of what sounded like a child reciting multiplication tables while sobbing.

 

The struggler took nothing. He left no mark. He climbed the embankment and disappeared into the smoke-gray morning.

 

The light grew sick.

 

It shifted in nauseous hues-amber, bile, mold. The sky above was a wet film stretched too tight, straining to hold back something heavier than weather. He walked under it, the road gone to gravel, the gravel gone to bone. Each step felt thinner than the last.

 

The trees thinned into crooked silhouettes, some split from lightning, others bleeding resin the color of spoiled milk. From their limbs hung bundles of plastic cutlery bound in old rosary beads, swaying gently as if in prayer. Their clinking was steady, like teeth in the wind.

 

The struggler had not eaten in days. His thoughts came in jagged flashes. Words lost meaning. His name-had he ever had one? When he tried to remember his voice, all he could summon was the sound of static or a wet cough in a silent room. His dreams had begun to seep into the waking world.

 

At a ravine’s edge, he found a woman cooking something over a small flame. Her clothes were neat. Hair braided. She smiled without teeth and offered him broth from a ladle shaped like a baby’s shoe.

 

He reached for it. She was gone.

 

Only the flame remained, flickering over a pile of rotted dolls.

 

The next night, he woke to the sound of breathing-his own, multiplied. From all directions, labored gasps, like a hospital ward sealed underground. He screamed once to cut through it. The sounds stopped. But they didn’t leave. They entered him. And he carried them forward.

 

The earth began to tilt. He found himself walking uphill no matter which direction he faced. Insects crawled from frozen puddles. A road sign lay facedown in the mud. He flipped it over. It read:

 

""WELCOME BACK""

 

His fingers trembled.

 

Later, he came upon a farmhouse half-swallowed by mud. In the yard, dozens of suitcases stood upright, arranged in rows, their zippers rusted shut. A single chair faced them, and on that chair sat a scarecrow dressed in a military uniform, its head replaced by a mirror. When he looked into it, he saw nothing. Not even sky. Just an absence shaped like a man.

 

He walked on.

 

A field of clothes danced in the wind without bodies. Jeans, coats, socks-threadbare and sun-bleached-tied to fence posts. When he passed, they stopped moving. All at once. As if watching.

 

At dusk, the fog grew teeth. He thought he heard a child crying. Then laughter. Then nothing.

 

He did not sleep that night. Only blinked longer.

 

When dawn came, it was gray and flat. Vancouver was still distant-a shimmer behind the veil.

 

He adjusted his pack. His feet bled through the soles of his boots. He could not recall what he was hoping to find.

 

But he kept going.

 

The wind had teeth now.

It didn’t howl. It hissed-low and wet, like a boil speaking. It scraped across the landscape and picked at him like an animal would at a corpse not yet cold. There was no shelter. No sun. The air was thick and cruel. Everything tasted like iron and mold.

 

The struggler’s feet were bone wrapped in leather, carried forward by nothing but pain and persistence.

Each step forward was deliberate agony, but he refused to stop. He didn’t know why. The idea of purpose had long since rotted into instinct. North had no promise left, only inertia.

 

It was sometime in the twilight hours-though all hours were twilight now-that he crested the edge of a dried-out cul-de-sac and saw them.

 

The children.

 

They were naked, but their bodies were hidden beneath human skin-stitched and slung over them like carnival costumes. Too large for their frames, sagging at the joints. Eyelids hung over their own like veils. Nostrils from other faces flopped loosely over theirs. Some wore two sets of lips. One girl had the stretched skin of a man’s face tied to the back of her head like a cape.

 

They laughed.

 

They giggled, shrill and erratic, the sound of playgrounds merged with night terrors. They skipped in a circle, hands linked, forming a crude maypole with a length of torn intestine that trailed from the open belly of a man kneeling at the center.

 

He was wearing camouflage pants.

 

And a Burger King crown, tilted slightly, splattered in something that wasn’t quite blood and not quite paint.

 

His stomach was opened to the world, a wet pink pit with his own guts spooling out like party streamers, tethered to the hands of the giggling children.

He wasn’t resisting.

 

He was praying.

 

""Though I walk through the valley... though I walk through the... valley of the shadow... I shall...""

 

His voice cracked.

His teeth chattered. His body trembled violently, more from terror than pain.

 

""I shall fear no evil...""

 

A child reached toward his exposed belly with filthy fingers and poked him. He flinched, stifled a scream, and kept speaking, tears running freely down his cheeks.

 

""For Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff... they comfort me.""

 

The prayer was not strength. It was collapse.

 

It was begging.

 

It was all he had left.

 

The children clapped and squealed in delight. One child-the smallest-broke from the circle. She was clutching a plastic recorder, sticky with blood and flecks of hair. She brought it to her mouth and began to play the Star-Spangled Banner, or something like it-badly, off-key, breathy. The sound was grating and perverse, like a deflated lung being forced through a flute.

 

She skipped alone, orbiting the kneeling man like a forgotten satellite. His lips still moved. Whether from faith or fear, no one could say.

 

The struggler froze behind a rusted sedan carcass, watching with open, raw eyes. His breath caught in his throat. Not from fear. No. Not anymore. That emotion had long since calcified.

 

This was worse.

 

This was recognition.

 

He remembered the Burger King crown. He remembered giving one to his son, on a birthday blurred by ash and hunger. He remembered the camouflage pants. He remembered the psalm. He remembered kneeling like that.

 

And for a moment, he wasn’t the struggler.

 

He was the man in the circle.

And he was the children.

And he was the intestine, the blood, the mud, the song.

He was the crown, tilted and stupid.

He was the observer and the witnessed.

He was the scripture being spoken in futility to a sky that had long since stopped listening.

 

He stumbled backward, eyes burning.

 

A child noticed him.

 

One with two noses, one real and one stitched on. Her feet were bare and red. She pointed, but didn’t speak. The others followed her gaze.

 

And they stopped spinning.

 

The intestine dropped to the dirt like a rope severed from its anchor.

 

The man keeled forward, face-first into the dirt, whispering:

 

""...Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies...""

 

He did not rise again.

 

The children smiled.

 

All of them.

 

Wide, slack-jawed grins like masks.

Then they began walking toward the struggler.

 

He turned.

 

And ran.

 

The trees fell away into a skeletal orchard of broken light poles and dead signage. His feet ached, skin sloughing inside the boots, toes curled into claws of infection and grit. Every step felt like walking on hot coals wrapped in glass.

 

He remembered a time when his body responded with purpose - before the hunger settled in, before the cold fused itself to his spine like a parasite. Now he walked like a machine fed by instinct and dread. His lips were cracked deep enough to bleed, and he licked them anyway, tasting salt and rot. Each breath tasted like mildew, like damp coin purses forgotten in flooded basements. The rain had a smell now - not the clean slate of childhood monsoons, but something murkier. Chemical. Stale. Like pesticide.

 

As he moved forward, flickers of memory began to rise - not as visions, but as ambushes. The smell of morning coffee grounds still stuck in a paper filter. The way a damp towel clung to his chest after she pulled it from her shoulders and draped it around him. A campfire crackling in the pines, the smoke sweet with pine sap and hot dogs. The hiss of bacon in a cast-iron pan. Her humming while brushing her teeth. Cold orange juice in a glass she left on the nightstand. These weren’t images, they were textural hauntings. They came not as comfort, but as grief made physical.

 

The road underfoot had dissolved into rot - patches of slick moss and broken gravel where asphalt once held form. Every step jolted pain through the arches of his feet, nerves screaming beneath blistered skin. He stumbled on a rusted hubcap half-buried in muck. Nearby, a half-collapsed mailbox sagged open, its contents ruined by rain: pulped bills, curled photographs, a child’s crayon drawing melted into pink and green smears. He paused, unsure why. Just stood there, staring at it. The picture had been of a house. Maybe a dog. Maybe a family. He couldn’t tell. He wiped his nose and kept moving.

 

Someone had built a roadside memorial out of cinderblocks and split plastic flowers. A candle had burned low and drowned in wax weeks ago. Everything smelled faintly of old shoes and burnt sugar. A soaked flannel shirt had been draped over the stones like a flag. He reached out and touched it. It was cold. It reminded him of a jacket he'd once loaned someone, long ago, and never got back.

 

His stomach growled loud enough to echo in his ears. No food. No warmth. No shelter. But he walked anyway.

 

At the crest of a hill, his body screamed to stop. But some ancient command still drove him, fossilized and burning behind his eyes.

 

The silence grew heavier - not absence, but presence. A watching quiet. The kind that made your skin crawl without contact.

 

Then he saw it.

 

A road sign, bent at the spine, leaning toward the concrete median as if whispering a final warning:

 

VANCOUVER 113 MILES

 

The lettering had all but vanished in the rainlight, but below it, something stood out - a message painted sloppily with a brush, the red letters swollen and bleeding into the metal’s corrosion:

 

ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE

 

The brushstrokes were jagged, uneven. Not art. Not graffiti. A confession. A wound. It looked rushed, desperate - as if someone had written it mid-breakdown, hands shaking, paint pooling in their knuckles.

 

He didn’t cry. He didn’t curse.

 

He stood there as the wind cut through his coat and into his bones. As if the sign had been written for him, knowing he’d come. Knowing he would read it.

 

But he moved on. Because moving was all he had left.

 

It was midafternoon when he found the checkpoint.

 

If time still mattered. The sun was somewhere behind the smoke-thick sky, pale and lifeless as a cataract. The wind carried the smell of stale fuel and wet paper. A shredded billboard nearby read: WELCOME TO THE PACIFIC MILITARY COALITION - SECTOR V. Someone had tagged over it in dripping black:

 

YOU ARRIVED TOO LATE

 

The gates stood open. Not broken. Just ajar. Like someone had gone out for coffee and never come back.

 

Beyond them, the kill zone stretched flat - a strip of concrete and sandbag husks bordered by old barricades. Where tents once stood, there were only the shadows of canvas in the dirt, like rot stains. And skeletons.

 

Dozens. Maybe more. Dressed in the withered tatters of the Washington State National Guard. Helmets cracked. Vests collapsed in on themselves. Patches peeling off like sunburnt skin. The bones had been arranged. Not thrown. Not scattered. Positioned. Curated. Like a child’s dollhouse left in a hurry.

 

One sat cross-legged at a rusted folding table, a deck of UNO cards clutched in bony fingers. A single yellow reverse card lay face-up, almost daring him to blink.

 

Another skeleton reclined against a generator, legs crossed at the ankle, plastic sunglasses fused to the orbital ridges, a melted Camel cigarette stuck between ivory teeth. Someone had painted ""COOL GUY ZONE"" on the side of the generator in glitter nail polish.

 

Three stood in a Charlie’s Angels pose. Fingers mimed into pistols. One wore a faded Hawaiian shirt over its body armor, tied off at the ribs. Someone had stuffed a daisy in the eye socket. The petals were rotted but still yellow.

 

Further back, a pair had been bent into a prom-night tableau. One bent backward in a dip, the other upright, arms around nothing. A posterboard behind them read in sharpie and ribbon: ""PROM 2033 - BEST NIGHT EVER."" The sharpie had run in the rain.

 

Near the tower, it got worse.

 

A single skeleton crouched low on the concrete, hands pressed to either side of the skull, mouth agape. The skull had been painted gray and black - exact mimicry of The Scream. A private apocalypse fossilized in homage.

 

The bones under the tower were different. Cleaner. Straighter. They formed lines. Spirals. One ringed a pile of cracked Motorola radios, another surrounded a pyramid of children’s shoes, laced together by their tongues and toe loops.

 

The radio tower blinked red. Still powered. Still functioning. A cable ran down to a portable array wired with car batteries and prayer.

 

The speaker sparked, then spoke:

 

""At Nordstrom Rack, find your new favorite for less-brands you love, at prices that make you smile!""

 

Static.

 

""This family-friendly SUV has everything you need-room for six, safety for all, and a future built for adventure!""

 

Static.

 

Then: canned laughter. Too loud. Too cheerful. Over nothing. It didn’t even follow a joke.

 

The struggler clenched his jaw until he tasted iron. The world wobbled. Not because of vertigo. Because it didn’t make sense anymore.

 

Someone had taken time to do this. To pose the dead. To broadcast commercials long after there was no one to sell to. He didn’t understand what kind of mind did that. Or what kind of mind stood and watched.

 

A G.I. Joe action figure had been zip-tied to the base of the tower, its face melted to pink gum. A sign hung above it that said: ""HERO.""

 

Nearby, another skeleton had been posed like Elvis Presley mid-hip thrust, pelvis tilted, one finger pointing skyward. A boombox beside it played only static.

 

He turned a corner and saw one made to look like Neo from The Matrix, mid-dodge, back bent impossibly far, vertebrae staggered like dominoes.

 

Another had its fist raised in Rosie the Riveter defiance, the bones of the arm painted red, white, and blue.

 

Each one grinned.

 

Not out of malice. Not out of joy. Just because that’s what teeth do without flesh.

 

The air was thick with mildew and iron. Every breath tasted like pennies dissolved in soup. He walked in silence, the radio still chirping broken nostalgia behind him.

 

""This… is CNN.""

 

A pause.

 

""Good evening. I’m Tucker Carlson… and tonight, we remember America.""

 

Static.

 

“A nation of fathers, sons, mothers, and daughters. A nation of hope. A nation that once told the truth, or, at least pretended to.”

 

The audio hissed, then looped:

 

“Tonight, we remember America… America… America…”

 

Then the laugh track came again, louder this time. The sound of an extinct people giggling at ghosts.

 

The struggler kept walking. Because he couldn’t afford to stop. Not here.

 

Not where the dead had been made into a punchline.

 

The fog had thickened again. It clung to the buildings like rot, seeping into seams and cracks. He had made it through the checkpoint, past the skeletons arranged in their frozen parodies, past the laughter leaking from broken speakers.

 

But something followed him.

 

Not footsteps. Not eyes. Something slower. Deeper.

 

He moved without direction, without rhythm, the motion of his body more inheritance than will. The sky above was the color of infection, and the ground below was mud and glass. Somewhere behind him, the base still blinked and broadcasted - selling dreams to a world that no longer bought.

 

And then came the thought.

 

Clean. Cold. Inevitable.

 

The comms tower still ran. Static leaked from the speakers overhead, followed by intermittent bursts of advertisement loops:

 

""Come in today for 0% financing on all 2029 Dodge models!""

 

""Your family deserves more. Choose Pepsi, the taste of now.""

 

Laughter track.

 

He vomited in the grass.

 

He didn’t cry.

 

He didn’t speak.

 

That night he found a power cable thick as his wrist, still coiled behind the generator housing. Copper-wound. Heavy. Strong.

 

He fed it up through the rafters of the generator shed and tied it to a rusted support beam with his bare hands. Split his knuckles cinching the knot. The other end he wrapped around his throat, slow and careful. He threaded it twice, then once more for certainty.

 

No note. No last words. He had no one left to lie to.

 

He climbed onto a crate stamped with:

 

PROPERTY OF NORTHCOM PACIFIC

DO NOT REMOVE

 

He stood. Swaying.

 

He took one final look at the dead base.

The skeletons.

The empty buildings.

The lights blinking for no one.

 

Then he stepped off.

 

The cable caught.

 

His throat tore open.

 

It wasn’t a clean snap. His spine didn’t break. His body jerked hard, spine compressing with a sound like a crowbar snapping a deer’s ribcage. His legs kicked. His tongue split on his teeth. Blood surged from his nostrils and his ears, hissed onto the dirt below.

 

His vision went red. Then black. Then red again.

 

The cable stretched.

Then frayed.

 

And then it snapped.

 

He fell.

 

Hit the ground with a wet slap, like a sack of meat dropped from a truck bed.

His body seized.

He pissed himself.

He screamed into the earth. The sound was wet and animal.

He lay there twitching.

 

Alive.

 

In the morning he woke with a neck blackened and pulsing, a cough that came out in chunks of blood and something else. His voice was ruined. His jaw dislocated. His right eye swollen shut.

 

But he was breathing.

 

He stared at the cable. At the beam. At the crate.

 

He didn’t stand for an hour.

 

And when he did, he didn’t look back.

But while quick and convenient, these at-home tests are less sensitive than those available at the doctor’s office, meaning that you may still test negative even if you are infected.

A solution may come in the form of a new, low-cost biosensing technology that could make rapid at-home tests up to 100 times more sensitive to viruses like COVID-19. The diagnostic could expand rapid screening to other life-threatening conditions like prostate cancer and sepsis, as well.

Created by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, the test combines a natural evaporation process called the “coffee-ring effect” with plasmonics and AI to detect biomarkers of disease with remarkable precision in just minutes. ",4,1752086432.0,EverythingScience,0,0.83,False
1lvqni4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvqni4,"LYST* - Vejle, Denmark November 2024","I have long wanted to write a review of this overlooked and underrated restaurant in Danish gastronomy.  
When we talk about good restaurants in Denmark on this sub, the conversation often centers around Copenhagen, which is understandable given the accessibility.  
However, I want to advocate for this restaurant, which is located in Vejle and is actually quite easy to reach from Copenhagen – it takes two hours by train and then a ten-minute walk.

The restaurant is situated in the architectural gem Fjordenhus, which opened in 2019 – designed by the world-renowned artist Olafur Eliasson, with all the interior made bespoke for the building.  
The owners of the building and the restaurant are part of the LEGO family, and the kitchen is led by the Danish-English Daniel McBurnie, who previously worked at the 2\* AOC in Copenhagen. Daniel was nominated as best chef 2023 at The Best Chefs Awards.  
  
The ambitions for the restaurant are sky-high – it aims to be Jutland’s first three-star restaurant and one of the world’s best. Let me spoil it right away: it is not there yet – far from it – but it is clear that this is a restaurant with great potential.

My visit took place in November 2024, which clearly influenced the dishes. As you will see, it was not a feast of vibrant colors and blossoming vegetables, but rather a true reflection of the Danish season – root vegetables, fish, shellfish, and game.  
Regarding the experience itself, I want to start by saying that the service was at a 3\* level, which makes sense as they received the “Best Service Award” from Michelin for the Nordics in 2024.  
Over the 5-6 hours the experience lasted, we were guided by a competent, professional, and, not least, warm and personal staff.

You begin by being greeted by a host outside, who offers a tour of the building and an explanation of the architecture, while you enjoy a small refreshment – unfortunately, I have forgotten what it contained, but it was a kind of warm berry juice – not particularly memorable and probably the weakest element of the visit.

After a tour that lasted about 15-20 minutes, we were shown into the first dining room, centered around a large circular bar, where the actual meal began, consisting of around 20 servings with a focus on simplicity and Nordic ingredients.  
Here, amuse-bouches were served, perfectly accompanied by the best biodynamic champagne I have ever tried (see photos). The highlights here were venison tartare and fish cake with king crab.



Next, we had a brief detour to the balcony overlooking Vejle Fjord – here, Danish caviar on local seaweed was served, and it was one of the highlights. The freshness and light salty flavor made it some of the best caviar I have tasted.  


Afterwards, we took our seats in the main part of the restaurant in extremely comfortable chairs, with ample space between tables and partially shielded by what resembled sails from a ship. From time to time, the staff would push these sails to illustrate the wind – mostly a gimmick, but it did make the guests smile.

Here, I want to mention the highlights, which were lightly seared Danish tuna, grilled Danish blue lobster with wasabi hollandaise, chawanmushi, and a sourdough toast with Danish mushrooms topped with something as exotic as Danish truffles. All of these dishes were at least 2\* level. Unfortunately, there were also low points, the worst being the dish with baby squid in a sauce/soup of browned butter and melted cheese. It was far too rich, and the squid was completely overpowered by the taste of butter and cheese. The idea was probably for the squid to function as a kind of pasta, but the dish simply did not work and was the ultimate low point of the evening.  
The remaining dishes were good but not particularly memorable.

After the main course, we were led back to the bar where we started and finished with three desserts, all of which were solid but not outstanding.  
The evening concluded with petit fours accompanied by fantastic coffee.

In summary, I would say that the food at this point is at a 1\*, maybe 1.5\*, and on some dishes 2\* level, but at no point did we experience anything that could be described as a true 3\* serving.  
As an overall experience, however, I would say the place is at a 2\* level, because as a complete experience with the fantastic surroundings and service, they are already well ahead of many 2\* restaurants in Denmark.

What does the restaurant lack in order to earn more stars?  
I think the dishes are lacking in presentation. I understand that they want to keep it simple and don’t want to decorate the dishes – I respect that, but there is a lack of wow factor, as you might also see from the photos.  
Additionally, the quality of the dishes is too inconsistent, especially in terms of taste and finesse.

However, I would not hesitate to visit again, as it is clear that this is a kitchen still finding its footing and trying out different things.  
As a total experience, there are not many places that can do what Lyst can. It is somewhat like a mini version of Alchemist mixed with AOC and Jordnær’s Asian techniques – and this, combined with the fantastic surroundings, means I can confidently recommend the restaurant to others who dare to venture outside Copenhagen.",17,1752086423.0,finedining,4,0.91,False

1lvqm2j,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meredithhoagie/the-coffee-table-sticker-book-by-meredith-hoagie?ref=1lgawz,My wife created a re-usable sticker book designed to be displayed on a coffee table,"I do work with my wife on her business on marketing, order fulfillment, and a lot to do with Shopify and Etsy listings, etc. I believe I meet the criteria for promo here so I'm hoping its okay to post even though I'm not the primary business owner.

We're in the final four days of this campaign and I'm so incredibly proud of my wife for going on this journey. She is nearly 300% funded with over 500 backers for this idea that she posted out on her socials only a few months ago and got a ton of feedback on it.

Here are some things I think we could've been better about:

1. A more extensive pre-launch campaign
   * she really wanted to have the campaign up sooner and while she did a fantastic job of involving her community in the process of making the product, she hadn't yet landed on Kickstarter to fund it and didn't really mention Kickstarter online until a week or so before launching it. We had some markets that we went to and collected email addresses for the launch and some social posts but that was the extent of it.
2. Do your own PR
   * we hired a company that I've seen promoted here in this subreddit before and while they were really responsive we didn't see really any return on that investment so it ended up just kind of being a sunk marketing cost.
   * I'm aware that can happen and no sort of result can be guaranteed in marketing, but I am left kind of feeling like we could've done it on our own. They didn't do any reaching out for us, they gave us guidance for a press kit folder and then clearly spun the press release through ChatGPT to make 10 versions of it, threw them in a google doc and told us where to cut and paste email them. It wasn't super expensive but I do kind of wish we hadn't used them, even though they were super nice and I believe tried their best.
   * The PR we DID do ourselves without the help or recommendations of said company gave us a verifiable large return.
3. Utilize the heck out of those referral links
   * maybe should've been obvious but when facebook ads could only utilize the initiate checkout option for conversions it didn't occur to me that Kickstarter wouldn't be able to track the UTM parameters in my link but it could track it by referral link. I didn't switch it out in our ads until about a week and a half or two weeks in so I have good data from the facebook ads now but the data from earlier in the campaign is muddy.

Thank you to this subreddit and everyone who’s shared tips, insights, and encouragement. It’s been a huge help!

1lvqjuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1lvqjuz/how_can_i_bring_up_communication_issues_with_my/,How can I bring up communication issues with my INTJ partner without making things worse?,"I'm a 25F ISFP married to a 30M INTJ, and lately, I've been feeling constantly talked down to during our discussions or arguments, and it’s starting to really affect me. My partner often says things like:

* “You’re completely unprepared for a proper workplace environment.” (He said this when I was freelancing, though he’s stopped since I got a new job.)
* “You’d collapse and fall without me.”
* “This is incredibly annoying.”
* “Just kill me on the spot. That’ll solve all your problems.”
* “If you don’t have faith in me trying even to do better, then why even bother with existing?”

He says that he has to treat me like a child because I bump into the coffee table all the time and don’t care for myself enough. (I responded, “But you also bumped into the corner of the bed last night,” but that was dismissed as it was whataboutism.)

He’s also corrected me mid-discussion about my English (it’s not my first language), saying things like “Please try to describe the word, because this is how you learn English” instead of just letting me look it up so we can focus on the topic at hand. All of it feels patronizing and exhausting.

What’s more, he insists he can’t show any softness or vulnerability because “a man can’t be weak that’s just how it is.” I’ve told him this is a toxic mindset, and while I understand where it’s coming from (I watch Asmongold), it’s still incredibly damaging to himself and our relationship. I actually believe sharing mental vulnerability is more of a strength if it’s done in the right way.

I also think this attitude stems from how he was treated growing up. His parents (they seem nice now) were mentally abusive to him, and I suspect he internalized it.

I don’t feel like he sees me as an equal (he would feel hurt if I told him that), and I don’t think I can grow in a relationship where I’m being treated like a child if that's possible when he's more financially successful and intellectually confident than I am.

What I want from him is pretty simple:

* Practice active listening instead of dominating the discussion or steamrolling me with long monologues.
* Stop using insulting or sarcastic language — especially during disagreements.

I know I'm far from a perfect communicator and I rely on him a lot, but I want a partnership where we can both be vulnerable and still be respected. Right now, I'm afraid of bringing this up in a conversation as I failed before, and I don’t know what to do next.

Since he's very INTJ and INTJs are generally smarter imo, I wanted to ask you guys : If you’re INTJ, how would you want this conversation brought up to you?

Thanks for reading this far.

[https://tow.com/2025/07/09/zero-bagging-jack-reacher-style-to-the-speedcubing-world-championships-in-seattle-round-4/](https://tow.com/2025/07/09/zero-bagging-jack-reacher-style-to-the-speedcubing-world-championships-in-seattle-round-4/)

I used a different jacket for this trip: the Western Rise Meta Shell. It’s a rain jacket that packs into its own sling bag. It has fewer pockets than the jackets I used on previous trips (the Scottevest Pack Windbreaker and Uniqlo Blouson Utility Jacket), but it’s warmer, water-resistant, and easier to carry when it’s too hot to wear. There’s a zippered pocket on the back of the jacket where I kept my toiletries and charging gear. You have to be careful not to overpack that pocket—it makes the back of the jacket sag.

I left the extra clothes, 3-in-1 charging base, and toiletries at the hotel when we went out for the day, so I was zero bagging at all times during the conference. I did the usual thing of washing clothes every night so they’d be dry by morning.

The family came along for this trip, and although they didn’t zero bag, they did one bag. Overall, we weren’t very encumbered moving around Seattle. And packing up to head home was really easy.

If you’re a fan of the Jack Reacher novels and his zero bag lifestyle, you’ll appreciate that this trip involved plenty of coffee and a whole lot of bus rides.",5,1752086135.0,zerobags,1,0.86,False

1lvqgb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1lvqgb3/usa_to_london_5_day_trip_travel_experiences_and/,USA to London 5 day trip - travel experiences and tips,"Just completed a 5-day trip with 2 kids and wanted to thank this sub for all the tips and suggestions. Our entire family enjoyed the trip, and we hope we can return few more times to relive the experience as well cover things we couldn't do this time.

I wanted to share some tips from my travel, especially for people travelling from USA.

  
**Money Matters**

\- Cash is almost not required. We converted $80 to GBP, but hardly ended up using 15 GBP just for the sake of it to get some currency souvenirs.  However, confirm with your cc that your bank doesn't have foreign txn fees and check once you return to USA. Have couple of cards as backup. BOFA charged me txn fees and I had to talk to rep to get it reversed.

\- Costco Visa card works best - travel cash back + no foreign txn fees + tap for tube/bus

\- If you have a fidelity cash management account, they reimburse ATM fees for cash withdrawal. We got our GBP 4 reimbursed for ATM withdrawal at LHR

\- Check out for family discounts - thames sight seeing ferry got us 2 day hop on hop off tickets for GBP 49 for 2 adults+2 kids. One way from Westminster to Greenwich would have cost us close to the same amount

\- If prompted to choose currency on POS machines, always choose GBP over USD option to get the best exchange rate

\- Lyca/Lebara sim had the lowest priced option. Coverage was great in the city. You can buy it from most convenience stores. 2 GBP for sim card and online top up for 5 GBP got me 5 GB which was more than sufficient for 5 days for pretty much non-stop GPS usage.

  
**Transport**

\- As much as we loved the tube, we found buses to be more convenient. Tube stations require considerable walking from entrance to train platform and it can get tiring especially with a little one. In most cases we combined bus and tube. Buses are a good way to get a feel for the city without getting tired. Top row gives a great view. Bus stops which have multiple buses, might need you to flag the driver to stop. We missed a bus because we did not do it - the drive slowed but did not stop and went on.

\- Google maps worked 99% of the time. The only time we had issues was when there were bus diversions.

\- Check for protests and parade schedules. We almost missed a tour because we had to take a detour of about 25 mins due to pride parade.

\- If you have a child aged 12-15, you need to get an oyster card to get the 50% off fare. You can do it at LHR - ask for the login credentials if you need to create an account to check balance online and track trips. Otherwise, when you try the register the card later it will flag as already registered. This step is only required if you want to track trips. 

\- from LHR to city - take piccadilly line if you are not pressed for time. Covers more stations and is cheapest. Elizabeth line is faster, but costs more which can add up for a large family. Heathrow express is useless unless u r rushing to catch a flight.

\- while taking a flight back, make yourself aware of time to walk to gate. We were in the general are waiting for our gate announcement and took it lightly only to realize that our gate requires a 20 min walk from the waiting area. 

\- Uber and Taxis are expensive compared to USA. 1 mile distance takes longer to cover due to traffic and narrow roads. One place I would definitely uber/taxi is to Buckingham palace - it is probably the only spot which required \~15-20 min walk from station. Not a big deal on day-1, but by day-4 you will be jet lagged, tired and those 20 min long walks are not easy if you have a small kid.

\- I don't use apply/google pay in the US but felt it would be more convenient to use it at tube stations every time instead of taking your credit card from the wallet. However, I couldn't register for google/apple pay from UK due to fraud prevention mechanisms that required calls and verification. If you don't use one in the US, set it up before you leave the country.

  
**Experiences**

\- If you don't have a clear plan, take the ferry tour to greenwich or bus tour - this will give you a quick glimpse of the city and you can decide where to spend more time

\- Harry potter 9 3/4 photo spot at Kings cross station is crowded with long lines during regular hours, but almost empty if you go around 10pm.

\- Do climb the monument to great fire of london. It hardly takes 10 min and I'm not the fittest. While not great views from the top (especially for pics due to nets), the experience itself was great. Do note that you have to leave even medium sized backpacks at the ground level as the staircase is narrow. Exercise caution while coming down as it is quite easy to slip and fall. 

\- Check out dome views of St Pauls cathedral from the mall opposite to it.  Bank of England museum is a unique and interesting place to check out.

\- While at Kings cross, check out other cool things to see - [11 Things To See Near King’s Cross St. Pancras in Less Than 1h- Free Walking Tour With a Map – London By An](https://londonbyan.com/kings-cross-st-pancras-walking-tour/)

\- Try to time your visit to Tower bridge with opening times (2-3 times a day) - check online for schedule. A cool experience and best viewpoints are from south bank side.

\- Golden tours 1 day trip outside london felt rushed - you have about 1.5-2 hours per spot and b/w walking from the bus stop to the attraction entrance, bathroom breaks, you will have very less time to explore.

 \- Check out market closure times - borough market closed by 5pm on a weekend which I did not realize until I reached the spot.



**Other stuff**

\- good shoes required as you will be walking tons of miles

\- get UK travel adapter from amazon - you can get a 2-pack for $10

\- While you see a lot of people jaywalking, do exercise caution while crossing the road. It's quite natural for us to look in the wrong direction while crossing due to right hand-left hand driving change. 

\- Overall, the city felt safe. There are few areas where you see boards about phone snatchers. Exercise caution in such places as its quite easy to be distracted when you are constantly looking at maps for directions

\- Carry a sim card pin. Best place to store it is behind the phone within your case. 

\- carry eye masks - summer sun rises pretty early in UK - it was bright by 4:45 and the early light can disturb your sleep

\- overall food tasted more natural and less sweet compared to US. Definitely explore local cafes

\- when it comes to chain cafes, we personally found coffee and food at costa >>> pret-a-manger. Most places will warm up sandwiches on request

\- 'Unfiltered' beer options tasted great. 

\- of all souvenir shops, we liked the tower bridge one the best.

1lvqcp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1lvqcp0/ms_perfect_anyone_has_the_link/,"Ms. Perfect, ANYONE HAS THE LINK ??","Six months ago, I was accidentally poisoned by wolfsbane. The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.
My body gradually weakens.
Today, my wolf is completely gone, and I have three days left to live.
On the last day before I draw my final breath, I agree to donate my kidney to my sister. Thrilled, my mate swears that he'll make it up to me someday.
My sister is being swamped with insults on the college forum after she was caught plagiarizing my Belladonna thesis.
But I come forward and claim that I'm the one who plagiarized it.
Mom and Dad are pleased, saying I've finally become mature.
At last, I've become the perfect mate and daughter in their eyes.
But why are they crying after my body has turned cold and lifeless?
Chapter 1
When I found out I was going to die, I accepted it with ease.
My mate, Simon Knightley, came to me with a sullen expression and said, ""Zora, Laila has been in poor health since birth. She's an Omega with the weakest healing ability.
""One of her kidneys is failing, and she needs a transplant to survive.""
He pulled out a Mate Bond Breaking Agreement to dissolve our mate bond. After hesitating for a long while, he gritted his teeth and said, ""Your kidney is the best match for Laila. But if you refuse to donate your kidney, you'll have to sign this agreement to break our mate bond.
""Laila doesn't have much time left… And she wants to experience the marking ceremony before she dies. After talking to your parents, they agreed that I should be the one to do it.
""I love you, Zora. We're only doing this to make sure Laila doesn't die with regrets.
""Once she's gone, we'll get back together. Okay?""
I stared at the agreement in Simon's hands. Ever since Laila Thorne's kidney failure, everyone in my family had been expecting me to donate my kidney to her.
But what they didn't know was—I only had one kidney left.
When they found out I refused to donate, they were utterly disappointed. They kept saying how ungrateful I was.
""Zora, your sister's dying. All she needs is your kidney to survive. How can you just stand by and watch her die?""
My parents wouldn't listen to my explanation. Instead, they kicked me out.
""An ingrate like you doesn't deserve to be part of this family. If you won't save Laila, then get out!""
And now, even my mate was forcing me to either donate the kidney or he'd mark Laila instead.
But I was dying anyway. At this point, what difference would it make?
""I agree,"" I said airily.
Stunned, Simon jerked his head up. ""Really? That's amazing! Laila has a chance now!""
He tore the agreement and hurried me to the healing hut.
Mom and Dad also received the news. They arrived soon after, and Mom threw her arms around Laila and wept. ""Laila, you have a chance now! You'll be able to stay with me forever…""
Afraid that I'd change my mind, Dad quickly had the healer bring over the surgical consent form.
Once I signed it, my parents finally relaxed.
""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad said. ""You're starting to care for your sister. Don't blame us for being biased, okay? Laila's been through so much—she needs our love.
""But we won't mistreat you either. You'll still get your part of the inheritance.""
I shook my head, swallowing the bitterness in my chest. ""Just give it all to Laila. I won't need it anyway.""
Momentarily stunned, Mom patted me and chided, ""What nonsense are you talking about? Of course, you'll need it!
""Even if your mate is the top warrior in the Lunaris pack and can give you a comfortable life, you can't just disregard your family inheritance.""
Slowly, I slipped into a daze.
Ever since I failed to show up for Dad's kidney transplant surgery five years ago and Laila donated hers instead, my family hadn't been this kind to me.
And it was precisely because she had saved Dad that my parents insisted I owed her and that I had to treat her even better.
From then on, Laila got the best of everything.
She also started targeting me by falsely accusing me, making Mom and Dad resent me even more. Eventually, no matter what I did, it was always wrong.
I used to defend myself. Now, I just stayed quiet.
Then Mom rushed to Laila's side, and Dad and Simon followed close behind.
They all surrounded her, and it was the perfect picture of a loving family.
Only I stood alone in the corner, like an outsider who didn't belong.
Chapter 2
My eyes stung.
Rubbing my eyes roughly, I turned to leave, but Simon stopped me at the door.
""Laila has to stay at the healing hut for treatment, and she won't be able to finish her Werewolf Academy thesis,"" he said. ""Aren't you working on the Belladonna Cure thesis? It's exactly the same as Laila's. Why not let her refer to yours?""
A pang of bitterness hit me. I knew there was more to his words.
Laila's health had always been fragile, so I had always done her Werewolf Academy homework for her. She had even asked me to cheat for her in exams.
She didn't want my grades to surpass hers, yet through plagiarizing my work, she became the top student in the Werewolf Academy.
In truth, she hadn't even started her thesis yet. She was just waiting to copy mine.
Noticing my silence, Mom spoke in a low voice. ""You know how bright Laila is. It's just her health… You're her sister. Help her out, okay?""
I had heard this over and over again for the past five years, and I should've been used to it by now. But every time those words echoed in my ears, my chest tightened.
I forced a smile and nodded. ""Alright. I'll go get it now.""
This was the last time. I wondered if Laila could still graduate smoothly without someone to plagiarize from after I was gone.
""I knew you'd say yes!"" Simon exclaimed. ""So when I left home, I brought your thesis with me.""
He quickly pulled it from his bag and handed it to Laila.
Laila stuck her tongue out at me, a smug smile on her face.
Gently stroking her hair, Simon bent down and whispered something in her ear. She flushed and shot him a glare.
I said nothing and watched their intimate interaction.
If my wolf hadn't been killed by wolfsbane, it would've been howling with rage inside me.
I turned and left the healing hut. Laughter echoed behind me, but no one stopped me this time. Perhaps they hadn't even noticed I had left.
I went back home. As I gazed at the cozy interior, I suddenly made up my mind.
I wanted to clear all my belongings. Since no one seemed to care about me at all, I'd just discard everything about myself. After all, I didn't want my things to be a burden.
I packed everything—including my clothes, daily necessities, my pictures, the gifts I'd bought for my family and Simon—and threw them in the trash outside.
I was completely exhausted, and my breathing grew labored. The wolfsbane had taken hold of my body, and with every movement, a wave of excruciating pain shot through me.
I was really dying.
It took hours before I regained some strength. Just as I got into bed and was about to sleep, Simon barged in.
Flanking a crying Laila, Mom and Dad hurried after him.
""Zora, you promised to give Laila your thesis. How could you collude with others and accuse your sister of plagiarism?"" Simon questioned, his eyes thick with disappointment.
""Zora, I understand that you're upset about me borrowing your thesis."" Laila sobbed. ""But how could you ask your supervisor to publicly criticize me online? I've been swarmed with insults! You're so cruel!""
""Zora, we're family. How could you do this to your sister?"" Mom chimed in disapprovingly.
Turning back to Laila, Mom patted her back gently and cooed, ""Don't cry, sweetheart. You'll hurt yourself. I'll make your sister apologize to you!""
Chapter 3
So it turned out after getting my thesis, Laila flaunted it on the academy's forum.
Unfortunately, my supervisor saw the post.
He had always held high expectations for me, even offering to help revise my thesis before. So the moment Laila uploaded it online, he sensed something was off.
He questioned her about the details, but she couldn't answer a single thing.
The people online immediately realized something was wrong.
How could someone fail to answer questions about their own thesis?
Accusations of plagiarism came flooding in.
""Laila's been so devastated that she fainted from crying several times,"" Simon boomed. ""Zora, you're her sister. How could you do this to her? Apologize to her now!""
Ignoring how pale I looked, he dragged me out of bed and shoved me in front of Laila.
My thoughts wandered. Why had he grown so close to her?
Five years ago, after my family disowned me, I had trudged through a downpour, drenched to the bone.
Then Simon appeared.
The moment I saw him, my wounded wolf stirred with hope. I could feel that he was my predestined mate.
He brought me home, gave me clean clothes, a steaming cup of coffee, and sat beside me as I poured out my heartbreak.
He pitied me, swearing he'd treat me well for the rest of my life.
Back then, he had loathed Laila. He never met her, but he despised anyone who hurt me.",1,1752085717.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I used to feel so safe and at home with him. I thought that meant we were going to make it. But lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m drowning in this marriage, and he doesn’t even see it.

I do most of the chores, even though we both work full-time. I earn double what he does, I have a demanding job, and I’m also taking my master’s degree but somehow, I still end up cooking, doing laundry, and managing the home. Before we got married, he even said I could rely on him more for household chores since he saw how loaded my work is. That hasn’t happened. He does dishes sometimes, but often leaves used containers in the sink for me to clean the next day.

What hurts more is that I’ve tried reconnecting in small ways. I’ve told him I miss how things were when we were just boyfriend and girlfriend. I planned cute surprises before like a movie night at home with a projector, snacks, lights, and games and he loved it. When I joked that I wanted something like that too, he just laughed it off. But I wasn’t joking.

I told him outright that I’d be so happy with just a surprise cup of coffee or my favorite snacks. Just something that shows I was on his mind without me having to ask. But I never got that. Instead, he’s always on his phone playing mobile games and browsing TikTok. I often feel like I’m competing with his screen.

The other night, I exploded. I cried so hard. I told him I felt like just a roommate who cooks and takes care of everything. That I feel suffocated in this marriage because there’s no easy “pause” or way to step back. No divorce where we live. He cried too, said he didn’t realize how bad things had gotten, and blamed his phone addiction. He promised he would change.

I told him I don’t believe promises anymore. I want proof. I even brought up the small things like my repeated requests for a yellow bulb in our lamp because I get migraines from bright white light during my period. He never followed through. That forgotten bulb now feels symbolic of everything he neglects.

He asked me what should he do to mend this and I told him: “You have a brain. I shouldn’t have to teach you how to love and take care of your wife.”

I know people will say, “Well, at least he’s not cheating or abusive.” And yes, I’m thankful for that. But emotional neglect and being invisible in your own marriage hurts too. I didn’t sign up to be taken for granted like this.

1lvqag2,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1lvqag2/restaurant_meltdown_me_not_my_toddler/,"Restaurant meltdown (me, not my toddler)","I have a veryyyy active 2.5 year old, and I am well aware of this. I keep him busy and active all of the time. It has been a long-term goal of mine to successfully eat at a restaurant, just the two of us. I know comparison is the thief of joy, but I get so jealous of other parents that can bring their kid out to eat with no problems. I’ve brought him out to restaurants on a few occasions (usually celebrating a family member’s birthday), and it’s been mostly fine because his cousins, grandparents, etc… are usually there to entertain him. In the past month or so, we’ve been able to go to Starbucks and he will eat some a pouch or egg bites. To be honest, it’s been so amazing. I’ve been so happy just to go out for coffee with him the handful of times we’ve gone. Today, I decided to try to go out for breakfast. I went to a place that I regularly order take out from, so they know me. As soon as we got there, my son was climbing out of the high chair, trying to grab everything on the table, and climbing under the table. I decided this was a fail and got us up to leave, but when we got to the car, he was saying how hungry he was, so I grabbed a book and walked back in. Unfortunately, I was feeling really discouraged and was teary when I walked in. The waitstaff was amazing and was comforting me, telling me it was ok which only made me more embarrassed. I ordered food for my son, I didn’t even order anything for me because I didn’t want to worry about eating it. He ate almost all of his omelette with peppers and mushrooms and the fruit cup. I felt so much better, but then toward the end there was a ceramic pumpkin he wanted to hold (you can see where this is going). I let him hold it with me, but then I had him put it back when we were done, and he dropped it. I immediately started crying and then the owner came over and asked if something was wrong with the food. I felt so frustrated with trying and obviously it was my mistake to give him the pumpkin in the first place. My poor sweet boy said sorry to the waitress and they couldn’t have been better with him or me, but I’ve just been emotional about it since it happened. I left a 50% tip and got out of there asap until the waitress followed me out to the car because I had forgotten the book I brought in. She hugged me and told me to come back again. I sat in the car and cried. So, if you have any stories of restaurant disasters with your toddler, please share them and let me know I’m not alone. ",9,1752085573.0,toddlers,4,0.92,False

Costco delivered Chicken Alfredo by mistake.  My husband had it for dinner.  I sampled it - about 8 spoonfuls - especially delicious because my dinner was a salad.  Glucose went up to 240 and stayed around to 200.  Was 150 this morning.  Will NEVER do that again.

The insulin mistake was that I gave myself 16 units of fast acting insulin this morning instead of 4.  I mixed up the fast-acting and slow-acting pens because one had run out so I was getting a new one ready.  I put a rubber band on the slow acting - 16 units - to differentiate them and put it on the wrong one.  

Endo's office is closed today so called pharmacy.  Don't let it go much below 100 glucose he advised.  Maybe go to E.R. if it goes below 60.  As it was at 150 it was fine for awhile.  I had yogurt and iced coffee with milk and cocoa for breakfast as usual. About an hour later it started dropping fast. At 120 I had juice pack.  Bite of banana.  At 100 I had apple sauce, another juice pack, more apple sauce, sugar pill, yogurt, keto bread with peanut butter, 1/2 cup raspberries.  It stopped in the 80's.  Now it's going up fast 175.  183 arrow straight up.  Geez.

I just got blood work back and my A1c read at 5.7, fasting glucose was 78, and cholesterol is at 168. My fasting insulin is 15.40 which is high. I suspected insulin resistance for awhile as my neck has darkened over the years and i’ve developed a few skin tags. 

I know i’m pre diabetic and the changes i’ve made recently are consistent 10k or more steps a day from being sedentary, being mindful about timing of carbs and quantity, and limiting refined carbs/starches and sugars. i eat a high protein meal to start the day and have protein be the center of every meal. I am increasing my fiber but i’ve been struggling hitting 25 grams per day. 

I also have a major weight loss goal so I’m tracking calories along with the other lifestyle changes. I have not begun strength training yet and that’s the next thing I plan to add. My main question is how should I approach carbs? I still like to have sourdough with eggs and some potatoes with dinner - is that ok to do or should I try to cut it out for now and reintroduce later when my numbers are better? Also, I have reduced added sugar from what I used to regularly consume and use stevia in my coffee and plain greek yogurt or as a sweetened soda or tea rather than full sugar or artificial sugar drinks.

I’m a recent engineering graduate based in Bengaluru and currently working on a startup idea in the education and personal development space.

The core idea is to help kids and teens learn essential life skills — the kind that are often overlooked in schools but are crucial for growing up confident, independent, and emotionally strong.

I’m in the early stages and looking to connect with like-minded people who are passionate about:

	•	Education innovation

	•	Child and adolescent development

	•	Psychology or curriculum design

	•	Community-based learning

	•	Or just building something meaningful from the ground up

This isn’t your typical EdTech venture — it’s hands-on, practical, and purpose-driven.
If you’re in Bengaluru (or open to collaborating here) and this resonates with you, I’d love to chat.

-walkable within 15 minutes to coffee shops, bookstores, restaurants
-partner’s potential job would be in the Paradise Park area and looking for a commute under 20 minutes

-within 15 minute drive of a public library (I am looking to apply to jobs as that’s where I have worked previously) 
-would love to hear from fellow people that have large breed dogs and where they enjoy living as our dogs are 95-100lbs 

Bonus if you have suggestions on areas + trails to go to that are more suitable to having 1 reactive dog and 2 dog friendly dogs (essentially places to go to on leash and places to avoid off leash dogs). We live in CO so pretty much most trails have people off leash on the on leash trails so we are good at managing but would love to hear from people with reactive dogs on places to go and avoid🩷

I have been purchasing pasta from them weekly for about 2 years and randomly one day we talked about how I design print materials as part of my responsibilities for my day job. They asked if I would be interested in working with them on a project and I joked that I would be happy to work for pasta. Nothing more was discussed about fees/compensation for services and honestly that didn't even cross my mind because I make stuff for my friends and family all the time and this would be my first ""freelance gig"" for an actual business. 

I will be reworking a 5x8 card that is already in use, they just want it to include a few new informational things. I have a feeling they will ask me to do more in the future but that is just an assumption as of now. I have gotten pretty close with them over all this time and I just think of this side project as a fun little thing for me. 

I was talking about this with my friend from work who does our accounts payable and she was shocked that I was happy with the idea of getting ""paid in pasta"" for this project. It doesn't seem like a big deal to me but her reaction is making me question if I am wrong. Have you been compensated with product for small projects? Should I invoice them? If I do invoice them, how much would I charge for projects like this?

1lvq35j,https://i.redd.it/usjxnlwk4wbf1.jpeg,Another Alkemia Sample Review!!!,"The yearly Alkemia sale has been live for a few days now!! While I wait for my rather large package to arrive, I figured I'd review my most recent pack of samples!
Also comment what y'all managed to snag from the sale I'm so curious 🤭
I'll be posting a big, in depth review as soon as I get mine; I am SO EXCITED!!!

* This sample packs was partially for me and partially for my partner, so the tastes are a bit all over the place.

For my choices:

Encens (Incense) Layering Note
(Encens adds a layer of smouldering champa incense that brings a mood of bohemian mystery to any perfume composition)

* I chose this because my favorite Alkmeia scents are the incense heavy ones, and this did not disappoint. It's just straight up head shop incense. Very nag champa-y. I adore how much incense scents add to my outfits and overall person/personality, and Alkemia has always worked in my favor there. Absolutely perfect!!!

Miel (Honey) Layering Note
(A golden honey note with a light beeswax background note)

* Okay, so I got this sample to test how it would layer with Lilacs Along the Winding Drive... lilac, honey, and sunshine if you catch my reference. It's definitely odd. I guess I didn't actually think of what honey may smell like, and this does seem like it's probably accurate. It's just so strange. Almost dusty? It layers quite well with Lilacs though, so who am I to complain? I wonder if this is what Bella meant...

Siren's Spell
(A beachy love spell woven from the sun-warmed white beach sand, star jasmine, plumeria, suntan lotion, sea spray, coconut cream, vanilla orchid, and tonka)

* This was my freebie and WOWOWOWOWOW!!! I don't typically shoot for aquatics or summer-y scents as I lean more towards smoke and incense, but maybe I need to experiment more. She is GORGEOUSSS!!! I cannot explain how bright and pretty and beachy and floral this scent is, it's just beautiful. One of the best freebies I've gotten for sure!! It reminds me of the flowers I saw when vacationing in Kauai, Hawaii!!!

For his choices:

Writer's Blood
(The primal angst of artistic passion - iron-tinged blood, a manuscript soaked in spilled black coffee, and an overturned tin of rolling tobacco)

* I could smell this thing the moment I popped the cap off. It is STRONG. Its also very very VERY strange. Coffee and paper and... hospital? It's sterile like an ER waiting room, but with the cold remnants of the morning shift's coffee in the corner of the room.

Supernatural
(An ethereal blend of Iso-E, ambrox, Tonkin musk (cruelty free), and aroma molecules)

* Subtle and soft. If I remember correctly, this is meant to be more of a skin scent. It smells very clean and fresh. Very cozy, but no distinct notes at all. Just overall super nice!!

Esprit de la Terre
(Dark rich loamy earth, olive flowers, pepperbush, birchbark, green cedar, sandalwood, Earl Gray tea, rosewood, leather, gingergrass, coriander, oakmoss, vetiver, and ambregris)

* This is the most masculine scent I have ever tried from Alkemia, and man, it's good. I've always hated mainstream alcohol-based colognes because they smell way too sharp and always trigger headaches for me. This scent is everything I've ever wanted those men's colognes to be. Its sexy and oh so masculine, but I love it! Cannot wait for my partner to try this one on, LORDDD!!!

Unsurprisingly, I'm happy with yet another Alkemia order. They're my favorite house for a reason, and I've yet to find anything that even comes close to surpassing Alkemia. Will always highly HIGHLY reccomend them to anyone in the indie perfumes community!!

""That's what he was made for, sir,"" Albert said to Osei, flat and without room for misinterpretation.

""Understood. For now, I think it would be best if you head back to Alpha Centauri. I'm sure they have another mission for you lined up,"" Osei said as he cut off his feed.

""Henry has excess funds. If you'd like, we can reallocate some to get a better coffee machine for the bridge,"" Albert chimed in from the intercom.

""So, first you turn him into a living weapon, now you want to take his allowance. How low you have fallen Albert,"" Youri said while shaking her head.

""It will be the one that does those little cups that you like. You know the kind that has all the different flavors,"" Albert said, enticing Youri.

""Correct, he wouldn't. That boy has no use currently for them,"" Albert said as he showed his purchase of a new coffee machine. ""After all, even if he knew, he wouldn't care that we bought something to boost morale,"" Albert replied chirpily.

""You're right, I wouldn't,"" Henry said as he walked in with Valasquez.

""Damn Albert, always trying to spend his money,"" Valasquez said with a laugh. Albert projected his Avatar on the projector.

""You caught me, but it's boosting crew morale,"" Albert said as he took a puff of the fake pipe.

""He is right Sir,"" Henry said as he turned his green visor directly to Valasquez.

""Okay Henry,"" Valasquez said as he went to Youri and whispered something in her ear. Her face went red from anger.

""Area clear for stealth drop. No visible life signs in the forest near the target's Villa,"" Joy said. Aave stored the new plasma dagger and rifle that she got from R&D before she saw Henry. Target's family is down there with him. I recommend that you hit them at nightfall while they sleep,"" Joy said as her avatar appeared next to Aave.

""That sounds like the most reasonable thing to do. Should I leave one or take them all out? What does the brass want on this one?"" Aave said as she started to put on her armor, strapping the under pieces of her armor, and clipping on the magnetized parts after.

""They left this up to you, just know that you are going to see things down there. I would tell you, but this is your first combat deployment against a hostile force that outnumbers you. I think that it would be best for you to learn, trial by fire,"" Joy said as her avatar disappeared.

""Noted, just be ready to pick me up, please,"" Aave said as the door to the shuttle opened up, she fell out backwards. ""Huh, I see. This is why Henry loves this method so much. I can see everything from here,"" Aave said as she started to form a smile. "" After all that we have been through already, I can see why he loves this so much,"" Aave thought to herself as she saw the vast expanse of space and the trillions of stars. ""Maybe in a different life, things could have been better, but, Henry, you know just as well as I do that we are needed on the front lines. We serve better here than the front of a classroom or lunch line,"" Aave mumbled to herself as she turned her head and focused on the drop zone. She kicked on and turned on her booster pack to help guide herself down. She felt the heat wash over her armor, the temp gauge on her HUD rising, then the fire dissipated, and it was peaceful. Clear ocean blue sky. She turned her head to the left and saw that a storm was moving in too. ""Either the Universe loves me, or hates Admiral Korvalis,"" Aave said with a slight grin. As she got close to the ground, she turned herself, feet to the ground, and kicked on the booster pack to full thrust.

Aave moved deeper into the forest to help prevent being spotted. While under dense foliage from the massive trees, four meters thick from side to side, she opened her HUD and Tac-Map. ""GPS says that I am here, and poor Korvalis's Villa is here,"" she mumbled to herself as she moved the Tac-Map projection around. After she set her target location, her HUD updated, and she just followed the arrows. ""Thank god for this tech, I couldn't imagine having to do this on every hostile planet without it,"" She said, grateful for the latest UHC tech. As she got close to the villa, she stopped. ""I should find a vantage point and scout this place out,"" She thought to herself. With no real solid vantage point, with a thought, she turned up the anti-gravity generator and jumped up into a tree close to the villa. It was a massive complex that had four towers for guards, beautiful white stone walls with massive blue wooden gate doors. ""Is this a villa or a fucking base,"" Aave muttered to herself. Then she just waited till she spotted the Altherium Admiral. After almost an hour, she spotted him, along with five Humans. They looked like husks of the people they probably once were. The Admiral shoved one of the slaves down, then shot her.

""Joy, can you translate what he said for me?"" Aave asked.

""You fucking dirty whore. Your people destroyed my brother's fleet. He was up for promotion, and then your people destroyed Than-Imani. I had a vacation home there. When my vacation is done, I will make your worlds burn, then sell your children. I hear they make for great meals."" Joy said as her avatar, at this point just a thin line, translated.

""Huh, I guess this is what you mean by trial by fire,"" Aave said. She turned her armor's audio tracker up just a little bit more. Then leveled her scope. Just as she was about to pull the trigger, the Admiral's son busted out of a door chasing a human woman. Her clothes were torn, and she was sprinting away from him as fast as she could. To Aave, what was happening was obvious. Korvalis leveled his laser pistol and shot her in the back. She dropped and slid a foot or two, then didn't move again, eyes wide.

""I've made my choice Joy,"" Aave said and then waited for the storm to move in. ""Visibility in this rain and darkness makes visibility abysmal, time to move,"" Aave told herself as she dismounted from the tree and made her way to the villa. Turning down the gravity generator again, she leaped up the tower landing without a sound. Before the guard could even react, she cut his throat and tossed him full force back to the woods. She repeated the same process with the other three tower guards, then slipped into the Villa. There was a guard who was stationed at the door. As soon as she slipped in, she tossed her dagger through his forehead. Silently creeping through the house, she made her way room by room and systematically killed everyone, saving the Admiral for last.

She killed his wife, then lightly tapped him to wake him up. He tried screaming, but she held her blade to his throat. She slowly put a finger to his lips. ""Don't waste your breath. Nobody is coming; they are all dead,"" she said cheerfully.

""What do you mean that they are all dead?"" He asked as he looked over to see his wife's eyes still closed, but blood pooled all around her, and a stab wound on her throat. Korvalis threw up the moment he realized what had happened.

""You see, I was going to let everyone else live, till I saw your son and that woman. Then it finally clicked. We are nothing but cattle to you people. Don't get it twisted, you're about to die too. I just wanted to let you know before you do that the death of everyone that was here is because of the actions you took. Had you done anything different besides kill her, I would have left your wife and other kids and family members live. Except for your son, of course. I am going to plant evidence that will point your family's demise to House Than-Vil. In your next life remember that sometimes the bull kills the rancher,"" Aave finished as she stabbed him in the heart and cut upwards to his chin.

""Joy is the shuttle inbound? I need a bath,"" Aave asked as she started to make her way back to the entrance, her black armor covered in blood spray and water droplets.",5,1752084879.0,HFY,3,1.0,False
