1ihr339,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ihr339/how_to_win_in_trading_keep_going_after_everyone/,How to win in trading: keep going after everyone else stops,"Hi everyone,

I'm a husband, a dad of five, and a full-time trader.

Making the leap to full-time trading has been quite a journey, and along the way, I’ve picked up some concepts that have helped me navigate the ups and downs.

As I’ve been writing out these ideas for myself, I thought they might hopefully be encouraging to others—whether you're considering the transition to full-time trading or just looking to refine your approach.

**Here's my post:**

Last week, I had coffee with an aspiring trader. The last time we talked, he was bursting with fresh ideas and eager to make his mark in the trading world.

But when I asked how things were going, and if he was still working toward making trading his full-time career, he hesitated.

""Trading was way harder than I expected,"" he said. ""I lost money and decided to stop. I tried stocks and options—options were cool, but I just couldn’t grasp it.

I realized it would take years to get good at this and I’m not ready to invest that kind of time right now. Maybe I’ll try again someday.""

Unfortunately, this reaction is all too common. But why is it the norm for so many?

Yes, the barrier to entry in trading is high—but here’s the thing: so is everything else.

For example: the average acceptance rate for Ivy League schools is under 4%. Only the top 8-10% of realtors make six figures. Just 5% of all Amazon sellers generate over $1 million in revenue. The reality is that the barrier to success in *any* field is high.

I don’t think trading is anything extraordinary. It’s not some mysterious ""boogeyman"" of business that's harder than other career paths. I believe it’s totally achievable for the person who truly wants it and is willing to put in the work—just like earning an Ivy League education, excelling in real estate, or hitting $1 million in Amazon sales. It all comes down to the individual and their commitment.

That’s why it’s frustrating to see new traders give in to self-doubt. So much potential gets derailed by short-term discouragement.

Today, I want to offer some encouragement. A career in trading isn’t just worth pursuing—it’s absolutely possible when built on the right foundation.

Let’s flip the script on this undeserved doubt and push your trading journey forward.

# The big problem with short term thinking

When I talk to struggling traders, or those hoping to transition to full-time, there’s a common theme: they view trading as a fast and easy path to riches. But in reality, it’s just like any other vocation or business.

Think about it—when else is taking the long road ever seen as a problem? Plumbers, dentists, real estate agents, and restaurant owners don’t have an issue with putting in the time and effort to get where they want to go.

What if we as traders adopted the same mindset?  
Trading is a business, after all.

What if, instead of thinking like most new traders who focus on days and weeks, we shifted to thinking in terms of months and years?

Whenever I face a decision, I like to ask myself: ""If I choose this path, what’s the alternative?"" In trading, the alternative to long-term thinking is, of course, short-term thinking—and that’s where the real problems start. This mindset can lead to things like:

* **Rushing to make a profit right away.** What if a restaurant tried this? They might cut corners by using cheap ingredients, skimp on marketing, skip employee training, and ignore the fundamentals—leading to few, if any, return customers.
* **Making quick decisions with large amounts of money, without the experience to back it up.** What if a new plumber took out a huge loan for tons of equipment and work trucks, without any real customers or business experience? Wouldn’t it make more sense to use what he has, build a customer base, and then figure out what tools he actually needs?
* **Jumping from one strategy to the next, without giving them enough time.** What if a real estate agent, looking for leads, tried knocking on doors in a local neighborhood for a few days, then gave up to focus on SEO for their website, just because they didn’t get immediate results? Had they stuck with the door-knocking strategy a little longer, they might have seen a lead come through and realized it was working.
* **Starting each business day without a clear process or routine.** Imagine a local dentist who had no set schedule, no patient records, and no clear steps for addressing patient needs. It would be chaos.

Notice a theme yet? *(Good things take time!)*  
Viewing trading as a long-term endeavor is what truly makes the difference.

# But what if you’re still stuck?

I know what you might be thinking: ""That sounds great, but I'm still scared. I’m afraid of starting and failing. I’m not in the right financial position to start a business, let alone trading.""

And that’s okay. You’re not alone. Every single trader, no matter their experience, feels that type of fear. Every day.

My heart still skips a beat when I see the clock ticking down to the opening bell, even after years of trading. Millions of people—wannabe traders and elite fund managers alike—feel the same way. That fear doesn’t disappear overnight. It may never go away completely, no matter what business you’re in.

But here’s my encouragement to you:

What you want is just on the other side of the unknown.

Every day you take a small step into the unknown, every time you take another trading rep, or make a small process improvement, they all add to your confidence to keep going. Because remember, you’re thinking long-term, just like a real business.

This is how you win.

# It's time to win

I know—words are nice—but how do you actually move forward? What are some practical steps you can use to move forward in your trading journey?

Let me put it this way: If you wanted to start a plumbing business, how would you ensure success, stay profitable, and keep going even when others have stopped?

1. **Start with the basics.** Use new information to help lower fear of the unknown. First, you’d figure out exactly what you need to start—certifications, tools, insurance, and so on. You’d probably watch a few YouTube videos from different people to get an overview of what it's like. (I really appreciate SMB Capital’s free trading content - no need to pay for anything, just learn all you can.)
2. **Get hands-on practice.** Next, as an aspiring plumber, you’d start practicing with small jobs around the house or for close family, just to get those reps in and learn what it really takes. (This could look like taking small reps, I’m a big believer in one-share trades. Buy and sell one share only, until you have the data needed to show you where you’re profitable and you can start to scale.)
3. **Track everything.** As you go, you might write everything down. Maybe film or take pictures of each plumbing job so you can study them later. You’d track what you enjoy, what areas are low-stress and easy for you, and what mistakes you make—along with specific ways to fix them. (I like using Notion as a free way to start tracking things. Also Edgewonk is a great low-cost option.)
4. **Build a routine.** You then start forming a daily routine. You’d maybe go to class to learn the trade in the morning, do homework in the afternoon, and then maybe work on a small jobs for practice at night or on weekends. You’d then make adjustments each day, noting things like: *""I did poorly on my last exam because I stayed up too late. I’ll go to bed at 9 pm to focus better in class, as well as have more energy for my plumbing jobs.""*(In trading, this is what’s known as your “process”. Your routine that you follow, which you know gives you the best chance for success each day.)
5. **Repeat and improve.** The key in any business is repetition. You’d keep following the same steps every day until you get so good that you either have the pick of which plumbing company to work for, or, start your own business. Then assume it would take one to three years to get there. (This is when you find your “edge” — a repeatable trade setup that you know gives you positive expected value over time.)
6. **Bonus.** Along the way, you might only buy what you really need and try to practice frugality—no loans, using your own truck and tools, adding only as needed. This keeps the risk low while you learn and build your business. (This means keeping your costs and overhead low, in order to preserve and save up capital to trade with. And no need to overspend on fancy software or tools in the beginning— the focus should be on the fundamentals.)

# The bottom line

Let the aspiring trader at the beginning of this post serve as a reminder.

When it comes to building a trading career, you’re faced with two paths:

One path is focused on the short term, driven by immediate results and quick wins. This often leads to frustration and burnout, causing many to quit before they’ve given themselves a real chance to succeed.

The other path—which offers a much higher probability of success—is grounded in long-term thinking. It’s about committing to continuous learning, persevering through challenges, and allowing time to develop your skills and strategy.

Success in trading—or in any field—isn’t owned by the smartest, the luckiest, or even the most naturally talented. It belongs to those who *stay in the game*.

The truth is, every master trader, every successful entrepreneur, and every top performer started where you are: uncertain, inexperienced, and full of doubt. The only difference? They decided to push through and embrace the long game, and to build their foundation one step at a time.

So, what will you choose? Will you let short-term struggles define you? Or will you shift your mindset, commit to the process and lifestyle, and give yourself the time needed to truly succeed?

The choice is yours. The opportunity is there. You got this!",1,1738699718.0,Wallstreetbetsnew,0,1.0,False

1ihr218,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1ihr218/discovered_my_issuestrength/,Discovered my issue/strength,"tl;dr: I really enjoy tedious tasks that require attention to detail, and getting those details near perfect in every step, even the steps that can be considered unnecessary. I enjoy the jobs that everyone seems to hate. My best performance is always within the first 3 months of a job and then it steadily declines after that because I've learned all there is to know about the job and my brain is no longer stimulated.  I work best when I am constantly stimulated and have to be diligent with everything that I'm doing. I love paying attention to the detail. I need some assistance in figuring out what path might be ideal for me.

I'm currently late 20s and I've only ever held two jobs for more than a year. I've been consistently employed since I was 18 and have continuously job hopped, on average about 2 jobs a year. I have loved every job that I've started: retail (fast-food, coffee, and department stores), delivery, arborist, roadside vehicle assistance, plumbing, roofing, nursing home kitchen assistant, inspecting power poles, assembly (furniture and outdoor equipment), and other jobs I'm sure I'm forgetting.

Though I loved the jobs when I started, after I learned all the ins and outs and how to do the job, my interest and performance slowly waned until I was miserable and felt like I was going insane. Roadside assistance (with AAA) and plumbing were the longest held jobs because there were so many different things I encountered but eventually it became mundane as well. Through these jobs I always loved the tasks that everyone else hated. The ones they claimed were hard, tedious, unnecessary, etc.

Recently, someone asked me to fix their portable generator that wouldn't start. Never having worked on engines, I did some research and got to work performing some normal maintenance and cleaning the carburetor. What I found interesting was that I really enjoyed how intentional I had to be with cleaning the carb and how precise I had to be in tuning the carb afterwards. This surprised me because I've always heard how awful it is to work on carburetors, and it was no where near awful. I had a similar moment when I worked as a plumber, sometimes we would have to chip away tile to be able to install certain fixtures, and sometimes having to chip away concrete to adjust waterline/drain placements in slab foundations. Everyone despised doing those things but I loved them because I could make the tile/concrete do exactly what I wanted it to do, when everyone else would always end up breaking the whole tile when trying to chip it.

I don't know what to do now. I'm currently unemployed as I got fired from my last job from eventually, and unintentionally, missing too much work; it got exceedingly harder to wake up for work in the morning and I started sleeping through my alarms no matter how many I set. I even started sleeping on the couch and then the floor in hopes of being able to wake up easier.

Looking through job listings, I have some experience in every job I see (aside from ones that are specialized and require degrees) and because of that I can't bring myself to apply to them. I also despise repetitive jobs.

The only thing I can imagine getting into is something like woodworking, where attention to detail matters and you can make something as perfect as you want. But I'm not sure if even that is right, or how to go about getting into it and getting customers.

1ihqz5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ihqz5c/am_i_overreacting_someone_called_cas_childrens/,Am I Overreacting? Someone called CAS (children's aid society)on me for having...too many toys?,"First time poster! Hi everyone, I usually just read these stories but this recent situation has been weighing pretty heavily on me. Myself (41f) and my partner (44m) have a daughter (3f). 

As with most houses with a young child we had toys all around the house from the many detailed games she plays. Like some on the coffee table, dining room table, come books on the floor of her reading area, art supplies, etc. Nothing too messy mind you just a bit cluttered at times.

As anyone will know with a kid in their life; looking after a pre school age child is hard and we are too tired some days to fully clean up everything, especially on weekdays. 

I work in game texting from home and also did (will become relavent later) after school care as well for my friends three children (8), (5), and (5). So with all the kids multiple games out I will admit once again the house does get a bit cluttered by the end of the week. 

We are in a 3 bedroom one story with a basement that was most likely build in the 1960s and renovated and added to in the 1980s. The house has been in my partner's family sence he was 7. My partner not only grew up in the house but took it over after his father and mother sadly passed away in 2013 and 2016 respectively. This house has so many memories for him (His former long time partner actually tried to get him to quick sell it after his mother passed and even expected half the value of the house to be given over to her but that is another story, she always did not get along with his mother and we suspect she wanted him to see it to get rid of one of the last things his mom game to him that belonged to her).

I had a very traumatic childhood (Also another story) and as a result have been diagnosed with panic disorder and, generalised anxiety (whih is managed with medication for the most part unless I am under a hella a lot of stress), we lost our young son (under a year) in 2023 (aanother story, but that was the last time I had a major panic attack) and have been though greif counselling and CBT, hope to start trauma counseling soon as well (All have been so helpful to us and our little family).

Due to this I have become quite the hermit and barley leave the house other then to drop and pick up my daughter from daycare and my friends kids off the bus after school weekday afternoons. I go out on the weekends with my partner and daughter to grocery shop or thrift, but that is usually the extent of my social life. 

I speak to my friend when they pick up their kids, I say hello, general chit chat to my daughters day care teacher, and the other parents of they are there dropping or picking up their little ones at the same time as me. I text my partner durring the day when he's at work but with everything I usually keep mostly to myself. 

My daughter goes to a small day care in town about a 15 - 20 minutes walk from my house (only 4 other kids go there) and I try to be friendly and polite with the other parents. Myself and my daughter have gone on many a play date with the kids at daycare and the parents as we are in a the biggest town in the area and have multiple parks and activities to do with the littles in our town.

A new kid started at her daycare who was a bit younger then her and they both were getting along well (My daughter is a social butterfly and always take the younger children under her wing when they start at the daycare. We quickly because friends and I asked their mom if they would like to hang out and have a play date sometime after daycare. She seemed interested and when I came to get my daughter one day (with my friends 3 kiddos) he was there at the same with with her older kid who happed to me in the same class as the twins (the 5 year olds the previous year) this was close to the start of the school year last year (2024). 

The mom and I seemed to have a lot in common and became fast friends (or so I thought) we went with all six kids to the park, beach, walks, and even my house a few times as in it in town an she lives outside of town and I don't drive (don't trust myself too with my anxiety and panic disorder to be honest) When she can to out house with her kids for the place date she saw the buttery urn and pictures of our baby son and asked what happened and I told her about how we was diagnosed with a possible serious heart condition when he was inside still and actually had to be rushed to the hospital after a routine anatomy scan (told her long story of our precious ones short life) and she listened and told me how sorry she was basically how a person who truly cares would act.

She made a few casual comments of how clustered the house was and even offered to help me do a big clean up and I said that would be lovely as my partner and I were planning on tackling the majority of the mess over Christmas (and we did a great job considering the limited time we had) and ended up bagging up about 4 - 5 bags and boxes of clutter (unused electronics, house wears, extra toys, and clothing our daughter has outgrew).

Fast forward to last week when she came over to visit just me for the final time while our kids were at school and daycare. The house of course was in more of a clutter then usual as we were still going though stuff. She looked around the looked visabley uncomfortable, then asked if there is ""Anything she can do to help?""

I told her she can keep me company while I sort things to either keep of give away and she said ""Okay."" We hung out most of the day and she even went to pick up both her kid and my daughter at the day care (With my permission of course) for me so I could ""Work on the house more."" She even offered to drive and pick up my daughter on the weekdays so I can get more sorting done. I thanked her and said I would talk to my partner about it.

He also though that would be a great help and he works 44 hours a week and has to get up at 4am and isn't back every weekday until around 4:45pm (except Friday when he's back around 3:35 and can get her then) the daycare closes at 4pm and with three extra kids to pick up after school it saves me and my daughter a walk in this cold weather. I offered to give her gas money and everything Sean to be sorted for her to pick up my daughter after the dropped her older kiddo off at school around 8am. We got ready and didn't hear anything from her. I texted around 9am and asked if she was alright and still okay to drive us and she just texted back ""No it's a snow day."" 

I didn't hear from the her that day but thought little of it as she must have been home with both kids. The next evening a got a call on the phone what was private and I messed it because my phone was upstairs charging and I was downstairs. Then a text pops though from a number I don't know but says call me please and another number I don't recognize.

Because I hasn't heard from my friend I was worried it was her calling from a different number. I called back and this lady on the other is not my (supposed friend) but a social worker from children's aid (My heart was beating fast but in a good way because I had contacted them after our son passed with information on fostering/adoption and they said we had to most likely wait 2 year after of sons passing as per the rules but they will be in contact to check in on use earlier if there is a big demand) I greated the worker excitedly and asked if this was about us being about to fill out the paperwork for the adoption course early. 

The worker paused and said in a confused tone ""No this is not that kind of call..."" My heart sank down. She explained that ""Someone has called us and said your house is not suitable for when occupation of a child."" And of course couldn't go into any more details. We made an appointment for her to come up and check on the house (Yesterday). I then texted the person I thought who must have called (the mom from my daughters day care), ""A social worker is coming monday."" She immediately got very defensive ""Maybe whomever called just wanted to be helpful..."". I blocked her on everything.

Because of our son's death the coroner had to do an investigation and it just wrapped up this summer and feel like things were finally getting back to normal, mentally (at least closer then that have in a while) I was finally tackling the clutter. She knew what we had been though and still chose to call children's aid? Fealing so confused and hurt. Had my first panic attack in years. It was bad and almost had to go to the hospital. (For context my mother was a serial abuser of my sister and I growing up.  She would always tell us that is we said anything to cause people to call CAS we would immediately be taken away and never see each other or our family again) My mom drilled it into us all these people do is break up families and cannot be trusted. I was literally shaking as my partner and I spend this whole weekwnd cleaning up the rest of the clutter. I could hardly eat or sleep for that whole time...

Also had to stop looking after my friends kids after school because we both didn't feel right while this now ""investigation"" was going on.

The worker came yesterday and couldn't find one thing to be even mildly concerned about. (I am an assistant nurse btw and know exactly what they look for) she said ""We are obviously good parents to our daughter and boy does she have a lot of toys!"" I explained that is probably who someone called because they are to be on the floor and we have away about 5 bags. 

She then We asked a few routine follow up questions as she was just doing her job. When the worker asked why I think someone would have called. I explained that is probably because they are to be on the floor and we have away about 5 bags of stuff recently. She asked if the stuff was a danger ar any point (tripping, fire hazard, blocking any exits etc) I answered I never let it get that bad,just generally 4 kidos playing with toys all week etc and us being tired parents. We promised to keep up with the house better. She told us all exits were clean and clear, we have the proper alarms, seprate sleeping area for daughter, etc. 

Now she just has to follow up with my daughters day care teacher and doctor and she says the case will be closed. Feeling so relieved finally after days of being so stressed out. Still feel pretty betrayed and sad though...

*Extra info* This lady said the ordasity to say ""Hi."" to my hubby with a smile when he was picking up our daughter after she had called...

*She is studying to be an ECE (early childhood educatior) so she of all people knows there are many more ways to get us help tidying up even with CAS without having called any saying the house is unfit/unsafe for a child (those calles are taken very seriously and can end up on my record if I want to apply for a job in the future...no details just that they were called...let alone of adoption application...sigh...

*We are thrifters so always finding deals on stuff that's why we had a lot a stuff, but again it's been cut down significantly over that last while...as we were working towards getting house in over so I'm the fall we can fill for our adoption application...

Glad everything turned out okay just sad and emotionally drained 😞 thanks for the read/listen...AIO?

I don't want to come out as an asexual, because my family and relatives and some of the friends won't understand it.

   Another issue, and I am not saying it to brag, is I am being approached by women/men who hit on me or give hints mostly due to looking conventionally attractive I guess?Just about 3 weeks ago, I was approached by a woman who i loosely knew and she asked if I ever want to hang out or go to movies or grab a coffee.

1ihqv5r,https://i.redd.it/uc40ng5eh6he1.png,Creating a Supportive Workplace Culture During the Winter Slump,"**TL;DR:** Winter often brings challenges like low morale and reduced productivity to the workplace. Leaders can address this by fostering psychological safety, offering flexible work options, and prioritizing team-building and well-being initiatives. These strategies help employees thrive despite the season’s difficulties, setting the stage for long-term success.  

---

Winter months can be tough—for individuals and teams alike. The combination of post-holiday blues, shorter days, and colder weather often leads to decreased energy, reduced focus, and morale dips across workplaces. But the good news is that thoughtful leadership and intentional culture-building can help teams not only navigate these challenges but emerge stronger and more connected.  

From my experience coaching leaders, I’ve found that the workplaces that thrive during the winter months share one thing in common: a supportive culture that prioritizes both well-being and productivity. Here’s how you can create one:  

### 1. Foster Psychological Safety  
Psychological safety—the belief that it’s safe to take risks, share ideas, and voice concerns without fear of judgment—is essential, especially during challenging seasons. Leaders can cultivate this by:  
- Encouraging open conversations about well-being and normalizing discussions about seasonal struggles.  
- Holding regular one-on-one check-ins that go beyond “How are you?” to invite more meaningful dialogue.  
- Modeling vulnerability by acknowledging your own challenges or setbacks.  

When employees feel safe and supported, they’re more likely to stay engaged and contribute, even when energy levels dip.  

### 2. Offer Flexible Work Options  
Seasonal challenges affect everyone differently, and flexibility can be a game-changer. Consider:  
- Allowing remote work, especially during harsh weather conditions.  
- Offering flexible schedules to let employees maximize daylight exposure or accommodate personal needs.  
- Experimenting with compressed workweeks, such as four-day schedules, to provide additional rest.  

These adjustments signal to employees that their well-being matters and often lead to increased loyalty and focus.  

### 3. Prioritize Team-Building and Connection  
Winter can feel isolating, which is why fostering connection is so important. Some ideas include:  
- Hosting winter-themed team activities, such as virtual trivia games or indoor escape rooms.  
- Organizing wellness programs like group yoga sessions or meditation workshops.  
- Encouraging charitable initiatives like donation drives or volunteer days to give employees a shared sense of purpose.  

Even simple actions, like informal virtual coffee chats, can go a long way in creating a sense of belonging.  

### 4. Balance Productivity Goals with Well-Being  
It’s no secret that productivity may naturally dip during the winter months. Rather than pushing harder, align your expectations with the season by:  
- Adjusting performance goals to be realistic and achievable.  
- Offering resources like mental health support, gym memberships, or educational workshops on seasonal wellness.  
- Creating cozy, inviting workspaces with warm lighting or small touches like winter-themed decor to boost mood.  

By showing understanding and flexibility, leaders can help employees sustain their efforts without feeling burnt out.  

### 5. Leverage Peer Support  
Lastly, don’t underestimate the value of peer connections. Simple systems like buddy check-ins or peer-led wellness initiatives can keep teams engaged and supportive. Platforms for employees to share experiences and insights—whether in meetings, Slack channels, or informal settings—strengthen team cohesion and morale.  

---

### Why This Matters  
The winter slump doesn’t have to be a roadblock. When leaders take proactive steps to support their teams during this season, they build trust, foster engagement, and create a foundation for success that carries into the rest of the year.

When I would in sixth grade my parents and I along with my siblings moved to the US. Instead of going ti a big town or a remotely bigger city ( like most immigrants), we ended up in a small town in the south of Alabama. Ethnically I am Pakistani, so there were a lot of things that I had to navigate in order to balance my seemingly polar opposite worlds. When I was in 10th grade I started noticing that my peers were getting cars ( every single person in my grade got a car), except me. I am a little younger than my peers so that’s why I wasn’t sixteen at the time when my peers got a car so I thought  my parents will purchase one for me just like everybody’s parents. Newsflash: that never happened to this date! 
I go to a small private high school ( for context there are only 60 people in my graduating class). So it became evident amongst my peers that I didn’t have car. Simultaneously, I stoped hanging out with my friends slowly because of not having proper transportation ( also because it was embarrassing to get dropped by my dad because he would always blast some Urdu speaking imam on the car speaker). I tried  to convince my parents and I even told them that will pay for my car and insurance because I don’t want to grow up as a weirdo not having a high school experience ( and I don’t mean party or s*x) I just mean fun birthday parties, driving around to get coffee and leaving school during our free period. 
My parents clearly don’t understand this. I know this because no the of them have different reasons for why I can’t have a car: 
My mother: “ We don’t have enough money to buy you a car” - the truth is that my mother HONESTLY has no idea how much my dad makes or how much money we have or spend 
My Dad: “ because you don’t know how to drive yet, I won’t pay your high insurance” - He is not even willing to teach me how to drive properly and whenever I do he never sees any improvement

I just wanted to share something special with you all—my dad has a coffee and donut truck right here in the city, and it’s honestly the best place to grab a quick pick-me-up (or a delicious breakfast) on the go!

Not only does he serve up amazing NYC-style coffee (strong, bold, and always fresh). Trust me, if you’ve never had a warm donut from a truck, you’re missing out. He also serves pastries and a few other breakfast treats if you're in the mood for something different.

He’s been running this truck for years, and if you catch him on the right day, you’ll get a free joke with your coffee. 😄 His smile and friendly vibe really make the whole experience special. The truck is like a little community hub for regulars, and I love hearing stories about how people go out of their way to visit just because of his warmth.

The best part? He’s got a 5-star rating from everyone who’s stopped by! Don’t just take my word for it—check out the Google reviews and see for yourself: https://g.co/kgs/6QfVdPu People love the coffee, love the donuts, and really love him.

So if you’re in the area (or if you’re just looking for an excuse to visit), swing by the truck, grab a coffee, and say hi! I promise you won’t regret it.

1ihqqrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBSHelp/comments/1ihqqrk/how_i_cured_my_ibs_after_5_years_of_suffering/,How I Cured My IBS (After 5+ Years of Suffering),"Hi all,

It's been years since I cured my IBS. When I was going through it, I told myself that I would create a post and share my experiences. It's been 3 years since and I thought I would finally share my story!

*Disclaimer: This is not medical advice. This is simply my journey of suffering with IBS for over 5 years. Please talk to professional doctors, and do not assume that the things that worked for me, will also work for you. IBS is an umbrella term, that can cover a whole range of gut issues, all with their own problems and solutions,*

  


# IBS Background:

\- Currently 28 years old

\- AMAB

\- Suffered from IBS for 5+ years

\- No other major medical issues other than depression/anxiety

I first started suffering from IBS after going through a deep depressive period when I was between the ages of 16-18. On the tail end of this period, I started going to the gym a lot (5-6 times a week, for 1-2 hours) for around 4 years. During this period I was eating a very simple diet (chicken/rice/broccoli, oatmeal, etc).

Now, I can't say that this is what caused my IBS. However, between an extremely limiting diet while I was depressed, followed by a restrictive diet while working out, there are a lot of factors that could have contributed to by IBS.

# Initial Symptoms

I started to suffer from IBS between the ages of 18-20. I don't know the exact time, as I completely ignored the symptoms as they worsened.

These included:

\- Extreme gas after eating

\- abdomen pain

\- cramping

\- Sporadic diarrhoea and constipation

My initial symptoms were consistent the entire way through my journey, and only got more severe as time went on.

# Diagnosis + Low FODMAP

I come from a medical family, and my parents saw me suffering a lot. This ranged from keeling over at the dinner table in pain, being stuck on the toilet for long periods, or simply retreating to my bedroom for hours to ""relieve"" the pain through my backside! After a while, they suggested that I go to see a gastroenterologist.

This was a quick process. I saw the gastroenterologist, and had a endoscopy (why it wasn't a colonoscopy, I don't know). The diagnosis: IBS - whatever that means.

The prescription? *Yoga, meditation, and maybe see a dietician*. Not exactly a confidence boost to someone suffering daily.

But, looking to the next best option, I decided I may as well see a dietician. I found one that specialised in IBS sufferers.

After initially seeing the dietician, they suggested that I go on a restrictive low-FODMAP diet. For those who don't know, this is a diet where you stop eating high FODMAP foods (**fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols**). These can include, but are not limited to:

\- Dairy-based milk, yogurt and ice cream

\- Wheat-based products such as cereal, bread and crackers

\- Beans and lentils

\- Some vegetables, such as artichokes, asparagus, onions and garlic

\- Some fruits, such as apples, cherries, pears and peaches

As my dietician told me, the goal is not to be on this diet forever. After a few months, you reintroduce certain food groups to see what causes you to flare up.

So, that's what I did. I reduced my diet. It was a lot of Oatmeal with chia seeds, plain tofu and rice, capsicum and leafy greens, spelt bread and peanutbutter. After a few months I started to reintroduce foods one-by-one.

**But there was one problem...**

I seemed to be intolerant to all high FODMAP foods.

Every time I introduced something, my symptoms would come back in full force. Everything from apples to garlic caused me to suffer all over again.

At this time, I was also moving cities. So, I stopped seeing the dietician and simply made peace with my new diet and my persistent gaseous form.

# New City, Same Struggle

In the new city (Melbourne, Australia), my IBS was here with a new vengeance. Even when I was eating my low-FODMAP diet, I would constantly flare up. Every time I ate, I was in severe abdominal pain.

I felt that I  smelt awful all the time because of all the flatulence. This got so bad that I just stopped socialising altogether out of necessity, because I would be in too much pain, or because I feared that I had the lingering smell of IBS on me. There was nothing I could do.

There was only one saving grace during this period.

# Fasting

If food was causing my flare ups, the only solution was to limit how often I ate. So, I started fasting.

*disclaimer : I do not promote fasting as a solution for IBS, as it simply masks the problems. If you do fast, I suggest talking to a doctor and dietician so that you can do it safely.*

At first it was simply 18 hours of fasting, followed by a 6 hour eating period.

Then over the course of months, I reduced that to one meal a day (OMAD). I would a day's worth of calories in the span of 1-2 hours, and simply not eat for the rest of the day.

The outcome?

Well, my IBS symptoms were a lot more tolerable. My bowel movements were a lot more consistent. But I was miserable. I still wasn't socialising much, and I was STILL suffering from my symptoms - just to a lesser extent.

I was at my wits end. No matter what I did, I was bloated, gassy, and in pain. Every. single day.

So, I did something I thought I'd never have to do.

# The Infamous Faecal Transplant

With no other solution. I decided to make an appointment with another gastroenterologist. The difference? This one specialised in faecal transplants.

So, after an initial consultation, I was scheduled for a colonoscopy.

The diagnosis was pretty straight forward and no surprise. A few internal haemorrhoids, but no signs of anything else wrong.

*Addition: At some point during this period I also had to give a faecal sample. Not sure at what point, but most likely prior to the colonoscopy.*

So, with that all done, the doctor determined that I would benefit from a faecal transplant.

**The Process**

\- A course of antibiotics prior to the faecal transplant (**this will become important later)**

\- Collection of the frozen faecal enemas

\- A 3-5 day period of performing enemas, twice a day.

\- Afterwards, a strict wholefoods, mostly plant-based diet

I won't go into too much detail here for obvious reasons. But, a few things that made this experience unique was that this was in 2020, during COVID. So while they would usually perform the enemas for you, I didn't have that luxury. It meant that I had to perform the enemas myself. On my cold bathroom floor. Everything from defrosting the samples, to inserting them.

*If you want more details on this process, I may share in the comments.*

Let's just say it wasn't glamorous.

# Outcome of the Transplant

While on antibiotics, my symptoms had already begun to go away. No more gas, no bloating or cramps. Nuking the entire gut-biome seemed to just solve all of my issues.

After the transplants, I felt incredible.

It was as if my symptoms had disappeared. No bloating, no gas, no cramps. I stuck to a wholefoods plant based diet, which was easy as I was vegan at the time. Minimal processed food and drinking coffee, tea and water.

My energy was through the roof, to the point that I almost felt euphoric. This isn't uncommon for people who go through this process. Whether it's the change in micro-biome or the new gas-free life, I don't know. But I felt great!

That was until, the symptoms started again. At first it was  fart here and there. Then it was cramps after dinner. And before I knew it, I was back to the exact same problem.

So, I went to the doctor again, told him my situation. And we did a second round of faecal transplants.

The exact same process. Antibiotics, enemas, whole food diet.

And I had the exact same outcome. Nothing had been fixed.

The only saving grace that I had during that period were the antibiotics.

# Overdosing Oregano

To say that I was feeling dejected was an understatement. I resigned myself to a socially isolated, chronically ill life.

At this time I was also moving countries to study.

So, I gave up any hope of solving this issue, as now I would also have to battle with a completely foreign medical system, with no previous medical record.

So that's what I did. For the first six months I lived as I had been. Low-FODMAP diet, fasting and in pain most days.

During this time, I spent more time on this, and other IBS-related subreddits. I noticed that people talked a lot about SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), and the specific symptoms that it caused. Likewise, I saw people talk about the antifungal and antibacterial benefits of oregano.

I thought that if the antibiotics had helped so much with my IBS, perhaps it was a problem with my gut bacteria. If that was true, then maybe oregano could help lessen my symptoms.

So, I self-diagnosed myself with SIBO. I still have no idea if that is what I had. But it felt like a likely cause of my issues.

I also started taking oregano supplements. The bottle recommended 28mg pills, twice a day. So, this is what I did. I noticed my symptoms improved. So I started taking more. and then more.

Eventually I was taking 3, 28mg pills, before every meal. Way above the recommended amount. I did this consistently for 6 months.

By this point, my symptoms were completely gone. I had none of my original problems. Literally nothing upset my stomach. Not even garlic and onions.

So, eventually I just stopped taking the oregano. And to this day my symptoms have never really come back.

# The Outcome (3+ years later)

Almost 4 years since I stopped taking the oregano, I can say that my symptoms have mostly stayed at bay.

Am I a little gassier than the average person? Maybe.

Do I still sometimes get bloating and cramping? Yes, but so does everyone?

Do I now have a brimming social life, and a loving partner? Absolutely.

What felt like an incurable chronic illness was fixed with oregano oil. And my life has completely changed because of it.

1ihqmsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1ihqmsn/how_to_win_in_trading_keep_going_after_everyone/,How to win in trading: keep going after everyone else stops,"Hi everyone,

I'm a husband, a dad of five, and a full-time trader.

Making the leap to full-time trading has been quite a journey, and along the way, I’ve picked up some concepts that have helped me navigate the ups and downs.

As I’ve been writing out these ideas for myself, I thought they might hopefully be encouraging to others—whether you're considering the transition to full-time trading or just looking to refine your approach.

**Here's my post:**

Last week, I had coffee with an aspiring trader. The last time we talked, he was bursting with fresh ideas and eager to make his mark in the trading world.

But when I asked how things were going, and if he was still working toward making trading his full-time career, he hesitated.

""Trading was way harder than I expected,"" he said. ""I lost money and decided to stop. I tried stocks and options—options were cool, but I just couldn’t grasp it.

I realized it would take years to get good at this and I’m not ready to invest that kind of time right now. Maybe I’ll try again someday.""

Unfortunately, this reaction is all too common. But why is it the norm for so many?

Yes, the barrier to entry in trading is high—but here’s the thing: so is everything else.

For example: the average acceptance rate for Ivy League schools is under 4%. Only the top 8-10% of realtors make six figures. Just 5% of all Amazon sellers generate over $1 million in revenue. The reality is that the barrier to success in *any* field is high.

I don’t think trading is anything extraordinary. It’s not some mysterious ""boogeyman"" of business that's harder than other career paths. I believe it’s totally achievable for the person who truly wants it and is willing to put in the work—just like earning an Ivy League education, excelling in real estate, or hitting $1 million in Amazon sales. It all comes down to the individual and their commitment.

That’s why it’s frustrating to see new traders give in to self-doubt. So much potential gets derailed by short-term discouragement.

Today, I want to offer some encouragement. A career in trading isn’t just worth pursuing—it’s absolutely possible when built on the right foundation.

Let’s flip the script on this undeserved doubt and push your trading journey forward.

# The big problem with short term thinking

When I talk to struggling traders, or those hoping to transition to full-time, there’s a common theme: they view trading as a fast and easy path to riches. But in reality, it’s just like any other vocation or business.

Think about it—when else is taking the long road ever seen as a problem? Plumbers, dentists, real estate agents, and restaurant owners don’t have an issue with putting in the time and effort to get where they want to go.

What if we as traders adopted the same mindset?  
Trading is a business, after all.

What if, instead of thinking like most new traders who focus on days and weeks, we shifted to thinking in terms of months and years?

Whenever I face a decision, I like to ask myself: ""If I choose this path, what’s the alternative?"" In trading, the alternative to long-term thinking is, of course, short-term thinking—and that’s where the real problems start. This mindset can lead to things like:

* **Rushing to make a profit right away.** What if a restaurant tried this? They might cut corners by using cheap ingredients, skimp on marketing, skip employee training, and ignore the fundamentals—leading to few, if any, return customers.
* **Making quick decisions with large amounts of money, without the experience to back it up.** What if a new plumber took out a huge loan for tons of equipment and work trucks, without any real customers or business experience? Wouldn’t it make more sense to use what he has, build a customer base, and then figure out what tools he actually needs?
* **Jumping from one strategy to the next, without giving them enough time.** What if a real estate agent, looking for leads, tried knocking on doors in a local neighborhood for a few days, then gave up to focus on SEO for their website, just because they didn’t get immediate results? Had they stuck with the door-knocking strategy a little longer, they might have seen a lead come through and realized it was working.
* **Starting each business day without a clear process or routine.** Imagine a local dentist who had no set schedule, no patient records, and no clear steps for addressing patient needs. It would be chaos.

Notice a theme yet? *(Good things take time!)*  
Viewing trading as a long-term endeavor is what truly makes the difference.

# But what if you’re still stuck?

I know what you might be thinking: ""That sounds great, but I'm still scared. I’m afraid of starting and failing. I’m not in the right financial position to start a business, let alone trading.""

And that’s okay. You’re not alone. Every single trader, no matter their experience, feels that type of fear. Every day.

My heart still skips a beat when I see the clock ticking down to the opening bell, even after years of trading. Millions of people—wannabe traders and elite fund managers alike—feel the same way. That fear doesn’t disappear overnight. It may never go away completely, no matter what business you’re in.

But here’s my encouragement to you:

What you want is just on the other side of the unknown.

Every day you take a small step into the unknown, every time you take another trading rep, or make a small process improvement, they all add to your confidence to keep going. Because remember, you’re thinking long-term, just like a real business.

This is how you win.

# It's time to win

I know—words are nice—but how do you actually move forward? What are some practical steps you can use to move forward in your trading journey?

Let me put it this way: If you wanted to start a plumbing business, how would you ensure success, stay profitable, and keep going even when others have stopped?

1. **Start with the basics.** Use new information to help lower fear of the unknown. First, you’d figure out exactly what you need to start—certifications, tools, insurance, and so on. You’d probably watch a few YouTube videos from different people to get an overview of what it's like. (I really appreciate SMB Capital’s free trading content - no need to pay for anything, just learn all you can.)
2. **Get hands-on practice.** Next, as an aspiring plumber, you’d start practicing with small jobs around the house or for close family, just to get those reps in and learn what it really takes. (This could look like taking small reps, I’m a big believer in one-share trades. Buy and sell one share only, until you have the data needed to show you where you’re profitable and you can start to scale.)
3. **Track everything.** As you go, you might write everything down. Maybe film or take pictures of each plumbing job so you can study them later. You’d track what you enjoy, what areas are low-stress and easy for you, and what mistakes you make—along with specific ways to fix them. (I like using Notion as a free way to start tracking things. Also Edgewonk is a great low-cost option.)
4. **Build a routine.** You then start forming a daily routine. You’d maybe go to class to learn the trade in the morning, do homework in the afternoon, and then maybe work on a small jobs for practice at night or on weekends. You’d then make adjustments each day, noting things like: *""I did poorly on my last exam because I stayed up too late. I’ll go to bed at 9 pm to focus better in class, as well as have more energy for my plumbing jobs.""*(In trading, this is what’s known as your “process”. Your routine that you follow, which you know gives you the best chance for success each day.)
5. **Repeat and improve.** The key in any business is repetition. You’d keep following the same steps every day until you get so good that you either have the pick of which plumbing company to work for, or, start your own business. Then assume it would take one to three years to get there. (This is when you find your “edge” — a repeatable trade setup that you know gives you positive expected value over time.)
6. **Bonus.** Along the way, you might only buy what you really need and try to practice frugality—no loans, using your own truck and tools, adding only as needed. This keeps the risk low while you learn and build your business. (This means keeping your costs and overhead low, in order to preserve and save up capital to trade with. And no need to overspend on fancy software or tools in the beginning— the focus should be on the fundamentals.)

# The bottom line

Let the aspiring trader at the beginning of this post serve as a reminder.

When it comes to building a trading career, you’re faced with two paths:

One path is focused on the short term, driven by immediate results and quick wins. This often leads to frustration and burnout, causing many to quit before they’ve given themselves a real chance to succeed.

The other path—which offers a much higher probability of success—is grounded in long-term thinking. It’s about committing to continuous learning, persevering through challenges, and allowing time to develop your skills and strategy.

Success in trading—or in any field—isn’t owned by the smartest, the luckiest, or even the most naturally talented. It belongs to those who *stay in the game*.

The truth is, every master trader, every successful entrepreneur, and every top performer started where you are: uncertain, inexperienced, and full of doubt. The only difference? They decided to push through and embrace the long game, and to build their foundation one step at a time.

So, what will you choose? Will you let short-term struggles define you? Or will you shift your mindset, commit to the process and lifestyle, and give yourself the time needed to truly succeed?

The choice is yours. The opportunity is there. You got this!",0,1738698624.0,Daytrading,3,0.5,False

Few months ago I’ve started a new position and before I’ve met my new team mates I’ve introduced myself (education, work experience, hobbies, etc. on Teams.

Episode 1: Few weeks later I met my new team and at common lunch I’ve noticed one of the girls from the team suddenly “swimming” around me and we started to talk. We walked to the dining table and she put her tray across from me but suddenly she changed her mind and sat next to me (of course I’ve pulled the chair for her). While talking she mentioned all the details at my Teams introduction in particularly my hobbies.

On that day she went earlier home from the office and just suddenly stood next to me to say good bye (the only one from the team) and to tell just she is happy to met me in person. I replied to her how happy I am too. Then she walked away but after few step she turned around and with the sweetest embarrassment she said: we’ll continue…

Episode 2: after a few days I sent her a Teams invitation to continue the “get to know each other” phase but on professional point of view (I dont wanted to start flirting immediately). My idea was, that due to our home office regulation (only one day/month is requested as office presence) it would took ages to get to know my team members. She accepted and we started to talk again

I’ve tried  to stay  professional topics, but she didnt. She just started to talk about herself her life and feelings. She asked in the call, if I’ve talked already with other team members like this. I told her the trueth, no you were the first all of them - and I heard her subtle and quiet giggle :)

Episode 3: Before Xmas on my last workday in 2024 the whole team went to dinner in the evening but we spent our day in the office.

In the office she was swimming around me  again and I caught her flirting with me in a very subtle way. I’ve also gave her a compliment by praising her merch hoodie (a camera branded one). She was already at leaving home and I wanted to go outside to buy a coffee for myself, when she asked me if I could wait for her to go together downstairs. She talked about her plans to buy a new camera and what is my favourite photography themes (we share the same hobby).  Then we went apart and she promised me that we continue our talk at dinner.

She arrived an hour later to dinner as everyone else (she is a mom with a son and some pets) away from me. But when she arrived and our eyes have met she just smiled and stared at me like an angel. She was sitting in a group of the other girls from the team and I’ve managed to start a topic with these girls (about cats :)). She invited me to sit next to her. We continued to talk and after a minute we were just two of us. We juste closed out the world. She showed me pictures on her phone and talking the stories. At a picture of a fish tank she told me that is very special to her and her son. It was her father’s fish tank who passed away a year ago. It was shocking to hear that she was there when her father was collapsing and she tried to save his life with first aid :(

The evening passed and we said goodbye and she told me I should contact her when I want to talk.

Next day I sent her an E-Mail with my best wishes for Xmas.

Episode 4: 2025 started as a disaster for me - my Mom passed away suddenly in January.

When she (my pisces mystery) returned to work she texted me how she liked my last Email and she will reply soon and how kind I am. I told her my situation and she was also shocked and she was very understanding and wishing me all the best of course.

She was asking me occasionally how I feel and texting me to keep me relaxed and that she knows how hard it is.

I asked her if she comes to the office in the coming weeks but she couldn’t tell it.

Episode 5: me and my two colleagues went to the office last week and suddenly she also showed up!

She greets me every time with a handshake (it is not common in my country to shake hands with women) and she looked deep in my eyes with her mysterious angel smile. Suddenly one of my collegue came to our desks to greet her with hug and kisses on her face. She turned to me to explain me that they are good friends for a very long time.

During the day we talked again between some meetings and while other team members were around us trying to join the conversation we built again our tunnel, our own world. We didnt replied to the others, we were just talking with each other closing every one out from this world.

She left after lunch and later I returned home too. Then suddenly in the afternoon she was texting me on phone again. She was funny, she shared her feelings, fears, likes and some life moments again. Telling me her favourite movies and interests. I laughed a lot (after many very hard years). It was a great conversation again.



Some observations: we “created” a kind of language, we are joking with some words that only we can understand the meaning behind them.

She doesnt forget  (mostly) to answer may questions or just reply even on the busiest days.

She calls me sweet after my compliments.

I have never experienced an eye contact like hers.

She always smile at me.

It stood out that we share a lot of common things, interests, mindset, values.

From the beginning (I mean the very first time) I’m having a kind of interesting connection to her: my soul calms down when she is around me and makes me feel safe.

She is not pretending herself to something else, she gives herself in every way.



But…



Sometimes she just disappears for days.

Sometimes she isnt replying on my greetings or attempts.

It confuses me.

Are these her pisces things?

I know - I dont know her. We just started to (hopefully getting closer). But I am a Leo with my impatient instincts.





I am asking you, who had any experience with pisces girls. What do you read out from my short story?

My heart tells me - it could develop to something great. But my mind (or my bad experiences) telling me that she is possibly just playing around, isnt she?

Do I need to be much more patient with her?

I am confused really - I want to ask her out in the future to have coffee or just to talk or take a walk in a park.

What would be your next step?

Does it get better?,"Honestly, I started GP training because I didn’t know exactly what to do with my life. Always wanted to do something surgical, but in the end of FP got worried that my personal life would suffer too much do to portfolio and stress and hospital shifts etc. and impulsively accepted a GP training number instead.

During my first year, worked in six months of a hospital placement and then six months gp and loved my life in the first half of the year and hated it in the second lol. Now, GP mostly, still not too happy about my day-to-day.

I just don't vibe with the other GPs, patient presentations and uncertainty of plans made stress me out. I hate sitting in that clinic room on my own all day. The teaching is painfully boring and GP coffee meetings I zone out out of lack of interest of what is discussed. Once, I even cried in between seeing patients because of how painfully bored I was. I still miss the hospital.

Does it get… more interesting? GP is supposedly one of the specialties where the training is the easy bit, and it gets harder later on as your patients become more complex, more responsibilities etc. You do more things. The TPD and school is pushing the idea of being a “portfolio GP and being able to do so much outside of pure GP with your career!” Anyone here with a career like this that does fun things at work? Anyone who hated training years but enjoyed being a GP? Anyone realized GP can be a gateway into something more fun? Or am I doomed?

I fully understand that my personality likely doesn’t suit GP at all and in the ideal world I should just escape back to the hospital and do some sort of a surgical or procedural based specialty and open up my spot to someone who actually wants and would be good in this, but... we all know what the current climate is like and how unlikely making that swap is now.",1,1738698166.0,doctorsUK,2,0.6,False

I primarily ate healthy foods. In terms of food weight I wasn't anywhere near it. I've tried going cold turkey on foods I loved. It didn't work, I'd bounce back hard towards carbs.

37 male. 310 was my heaviest, around April '24.

When I was 26 I went from 280 to 165 by eating 1 sandwich a day, working a lot and biking/swimming/push ups, in 8 months. It's harder to exercise now. I've regained it and more over 5-7 years.

I bought a mountain bike in June '24 and rode it for an hour daily until November. I pushed myself to go on 2 hour bike rides in the summer heat, coming back with a headache sometimes but otherwise feeling a nice glow. If I didn't bike I was walking 1-2 hours a day since February, a year ago. 

Those things didn't seem to help me lose much weight because when I started biking I was 280lbs and was that weight until november 15th.

On november 15th I decided to take an educated gym bro's advice with portion control and adjusting high cal items like butter and oil, bacon and eggs. I had already been eating primarily meat and vegetables and I don't have much junk food. I've been snacking on avo, banana, smoked sardines, pork rinds, pretty health stuff yet high cal, for months prior to november. I eat a lot of stir fry and pork roast/tacos/burgers/salad wraps/soups. Bacon and eggs all the time. 

I've quit weed, alcohol, soda, sugar in my coffee 4 years ago. No change in weight. I avoid seed oils if I can, like I don't deep fry things in veg oil unless it's avocado oil. I only use olive oil/coconut/avocado oil but there's bad oils in nearly everything pre-packaged. I pretty much never eat things like cereal, ice cream or chocolate and I rarely have rice or pasta (maybe once every 2 months). I think it's bread, crackers and chips that got me here. I eat out once every 2 months (pizza!).

I decided to reduce my olive oil and butter use and just eat like 10% less daily or not snack at all or shoot for lower carb by having lettuce wrapped burgers or sandwiches. By ""10% less"" I mean instead of having 8 slices of bacon I'd have 2. Instead of 4 eggs I'd have 3. Carbs make me hungry but I keep hearing ""carbs aren't the enemy."" I didn't want to go down to 0 carbs so I started buying whole wheat bagels (39g carb) instead of eating whole wheat bread (59g per slice). I've been drinking decaf tea to get between lunch (2pm) and dinner (6pm). I wouldn't say I'm overly hungry, just mildly and it's snacking that gets me. My lunch goal is 1 banana, 1 avo, 1 can of sardines at 2pm. Sometimes it's just 1 avo but that hunger will attack me during dinner and I'll over eat then because I'll snack after until bed. I've made pickled peppers, pickled eggs, rosemary cheese nibs and such to snack on.

I can't blame my gf for my weight but she buys crap and for some reason I offer to make her breakfast on her days off so that gets me eating. We usually both skip breakfast.

I'm now 261lbs. I'm still eating donuts, chips, just lesser and less frequently so I'm not completely avoiding basically any junk food. I could eat half a bag of fritos if I don't watch myself but now I'll have 2 handfuls and mentally I reach this point where I can tell where I'm ""eating just to eat."" I think it's the salt that stops me... it just doesn't feel as satisfying as the first handful and I can now think ""put it away."" I rarely over eat actual breakfast, lunch or dinners in terms of food weight. My dinners are like a head of broccoli and a chicken breast. I was wondering why I wasn't losing weight by eating like that. It was because my portion control was off. I was eating too little low cal items and too many high cal items. I essentially needed to bulk up on low cal while dipping a toe into high cal. Butter and oils I've halved and that's when the weight started coming off. I now measure a teaspoon of olive oil for an avocado instead of wildly spraying it on.

It seems the biggest proponent in my weight loss was adjusting to what I thought were low overall calories. I'd guess my daily intake at ""like 3000"", when it was probably 3250. I was continually over the edge by few cal, enough to just not notice and blame it on something else. I can feel my hunger lessening now that I'm 20lbs lighter. I'm not as hungry in the afternoon and I can basically not eat until dinner but I'm trying to avoid the ""trying"" at all. If you skip lunch you'll probably be eating those cals later and probably after dinner.

One ""trick"" I've done is to choose foods that come in small packages, like yogurt or bananas because I know I'm not going to eat more than 2. It's not like a bag of chips that I can rip into and over do it. 

I haven't really done anything substantial to lose the 20lbs since November. It's snowing and I'm mostly indoors. I haven't made a huge effort. I haven't struggled. I eat when I'm hungry. I haven't seen myself starving. I can intuitively feel my weight and diet pointing me in the loss-direction, just under my maintenance calories and all it took was a mental reconfiguration. I thought for sure if I biked for 1-2 hours a day for 5 months I'd have lost like 30lbs. I didn't lose anything... and that pissed me off because of how hard I was going. 

This was different than dieting in the past. If I made a mistake (like I ate a box of donuts or 4 slices of pizza), I just got back on the next day. I've realized I actually can't restrict myself with types of food because it will start up a whole new cycle of failure - ""I ate 4 slices of pizza and so the next day I'll eat worse too because I really miss pizza."" I don't consciously plan to do that but it happens. There was even like 4 days straight back in december where I ate terribly, like chocolate, noodles and ordering food 3 times in a row and I still got back to it and I ended up losing weight over the \~two weeks of holidays. I think if I tried the ""cut X out completely,"" I'd have a much harder time. In November I tried low carb/no bread and 2 weeks later I kept telling my gf to buy me a breadstick of all things at the store and I ate 4 of them with butter for a week when that's something I don't regularly do. I can't play tricks on my maintenance calorie demand. If I skipped all meals today I'd probably eat 6000 cal tomorrow. I have to ride this fine edge of ""just below maintenance cals."" It certainly worked and I didn't track anything, the most I've done is ask ChatGPT for a rough calorie estimate but then that estimate would coincide with how hungry I was or wasn't after dinner anyways. 

I've also tried eating high cal with fewer food weight but it doesn't work either - I find myself wanting the satiety of having many bites. I've tried primarily eating salad - it's not satiating and I ended up eating a lot of salad and then too many chips anyways. I then feel like I've failed and continue the cycle.

This was all advice from my friend with a masters in nutrition and a bachelors in biology, who I'd argue with all the time about how I'm not over eating. He told me all of this would happen. He recently told me I'm not eating enough! Well, he was right.",0,1738697843.0,loseit,3,0.45,False

Sagely wisdom requested :),"I'm almost embarrased to post this because the money invested absolutely don't match my love for music -  but I guess loving music isn't the same as spending a fortune on high-end HiFi.

Context. I'm moving from a house to an appartment. I've recently purchased a RN1000A, having previously owned old (then new) NAD 317 and 319 integrated amps, and then an Onkyo TX875 because I went on the ""home cinema"" train. And regretted it. I love music. So I tried finding the amp that would give me and my family the modern conveniences of streaming (qobuz/spotify) while also powering the HTPC I built to drive our TV. We play lots of vinyl (ProJect The Classic / Ortofon Blue) and we still occasionally pick a CD and play that too.

I work in IT - no ""smart home"" for me - It's all Linux and tin foil hats here :) I'm pretty happy with the Yamaha so far. Especially for the price (obviously - as with all things) - I got it at just around EUR 1150,- which I consider a bit of a steal, as it retails around EUR 1750.

I've had my current speakers for over 20 years. They're old Dali 850 ""Red Series"" (from .. probably 30 years ago) - it used to be their upper tier series, and these are the big boys. I \*love\* them. Tara Labs Helix 8 biwires connect them.

Classical, Chris Stapleton, Heilung, Nathaniel Raitliff, Diana Krall, and not-as-much-anymore metal (as in ""brutal death / burn your village church black metal"" :)

But I'm going to have a ""long"" listening room. Call it 10 metres by 3,5m. And I know the old floorstanders will be too much for the room. I'd love something that's more suited to low-ish level listening. I'll still be sitting in my spot absolutely diving into music - but we'll also be hosting meals, having morning coffee, all of that, in that same room.

So (finally!) - what would make your ideal pair for the 100W 8ohm Yamaha amp.

I've been reading reviews of :

KEF R3 Meta

Dynaudio Evoke 20 or Special 40.

Dali Rubikore 2

B&W 705 S3

I've had 2 sets of Dalis. My 850s, and before that, the 2½way 450s which were legendary. SO good. I've listened on many occasions to Bowers & Wilkins speakers, though a bit ""cheaper ""models, and didn't really ""like"" the sound, but that was both long ago, and on amps I wasn't familiar with (around 100w-130w Denons). So I might be a bit biased, but then.. I've nothing really to base it on in reality.

So - which do I pick? Any others to consider? I'm in Denmark, so they'd need to be EU-available.

Would it be downright stupid to spend 2-3 times more on speakers than on the amp? Yes, better is better, but will my ""cheap"" amp be too.. crude.. to do these speakers justice? Law of diminishing returns and all that. Could I buy a pair of Audioquest QR1 SE's at half the price of the KEFs, because realistically I'll never be able to tell the difference? I'll spend EUR 3000-4000 if it makes sense. But if it doesn't, I'd rather not.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm not trying to impress any guests in my home. I don't ""care"" - it's all about the music that I love. (..and my guest will probably be more busy with discussions and good wine anyway :)",3,1738697587.0,StereoAdvice,0,1.0,False

Actual description from Zillow:

Since childhood, you’ve been sketching A-frames on napkins, notebooks, and the foggy windows of long car rides. To you, A-frames weren’t just houses—they were emblems of a life less ordinary. A life where cool friends gather, slanted ceilings echo with laughter, and towering windows frame the tree canopy as living, breathing art.    But there was a problem: A-frames didn’t exist in suburbia. Not the mid-century modern masterpieces you had obsessed over on Instagram. Suburbia was destitute with endless rows of cookie-cutter boxes, soul-crushing vinyl siding, and HOAs that banned hammocks.    Then, one Tuesday morning, groggy from another 8 a.m. meeting that could’ve been an email, your phone dings—a new listing notice. You press the screen. A mid-century modern A-frame in all its angular glory, right there on Zillow. Destiny. You almost choke on the sip of coffee in your mouth. You text your agent: “911 must go see this ASAP!!!!” You call your boss to tell her you’re feeling under the weather and can’t work today. Then drive straight to the house.    Your showing appointment isn’t until later today, but you can’t wait to see it. It doesn’t disappoint. In fact, it’s probably even better in person. Sitting on a quiet cul-de-sac on one of the sexiest streets in Northcrest. The yard explodes with color in the spring—azaleas, forsythia, cherry trees, daffodils, lilies, and more.     From the street, you crane your neck, hoping for a glimpse of the double lot. The listing agent claims “This isn’t just a backyard—it’s limitless possibility with room for an ADU or a pool.”  It’s a canvas waiting for your vision. Build. Expand. Dream. You feel the foam from your mouth, drip down your chin.    Then your heart sinks as two cars slowly pull around you into the driveway. It’s like you’re watching a real-life nightmare unfold. Two mustached hipsters get out of their 2024 Subaru Outback. It has the fancy touring package that’s never seen a piece of gravel in its entire life.  They’re wearing matching flannel, and a fake vintage AC/DC t-shirt. Then it hits you, this isn’t a house; it’s a battlefield and it’s time you defend what’s rightfully yours. You jump out of your car and full-on sprint past them to the front of the house. The couple looks confused at first, maybe they think you’re the owner running back to grab something you forgot. As you reach the front door, you turn around, then lock eyes as you lean down and lick the doorknob — nice and slow. ""Sorry, boys,"" you say, ""this one’s already claimed.""    And so it comes to pass—this is the story you’ll tell at every housewarming party, forever cementing your legend. Your friends will shake their heads in disbelief, and your neighbors will smile politely, wondering if you’re a little unhinged. But none of it matters, because you’re living the dream, tucked away in your own glorious, mid-century A-frame masterpiece. The end. Full video tour on YouTube, just search 3894 Foxford Dr.

Chapter One: Moving In

The house wasn’t anything special. Two bedrooms, a laundry room that smelled like detergent and old wood, a backyard big enough for Ace to run around in. It was the kind of place you rented when you didn’t have the money for something better but still wanted a place to call your own. A fixer-upper, as the landlord had called it. But as far as I could tell, nothing really needed fixing.
Except the chimney.

""Previous owner sealed it up years ago,"" the landlord had mentioned offhandedly during the walk-through. 

""Best to just leave it alone.""

I barely registered the comment at the time. I didn’t care about the chimney. I wasn’t the kind of person who sat in front of a fire with a glass of whiskey, contemplating life. If anything, I liked that it was sealed up. Less maintenance.

Ace had taken to the place immediately. He ran through every room like he was cataloging them, sniffing every inch, claiming every corner. A mutt with a bruiser’s build—part pit, part shepherd, part Rottweiler—he was the kind of dog that looked like trouble but was more likely to curl up next to you than bite.

""Feels weird,"" 
my girlfriend had said when she first stepped inside, her arms crossed as she scanned the walls. 
""Like… I don’t know. Old.""

""It is old,"" I said. ""That’s kind of the point. Cheap rent.""

She made a face, but didn’t push it. She wasn’t the type to argue over things that didn’t really matter.
She didn’t move in with me, but she stayed over more often than not. I liked having her around. Even when she was quiet, there was something grounding about her presence. Like an anchor to reality, a reminder that even if I was alone in this place, I wasn’t actually alone.

That first night was restless. Not because anything happened, but because I couldn’t quite shake the feeling that I’d forgotten something. Like when you leave the house and feel like your keys aren’t in your pocket, even though they are.

Ace slept fine. I should’ve taken a lesson from him.

I didn’t think about the chimney again. I didn’t think about anything, really. It was just a house.

For now.

Chapter Two: The First Sign

It was a couple of days before I noticed the smell.

I was sitting on the couch, half-listening to a podcast while scrolling on my phone, when Ace climbed up next to me and flopped his head onto my lap. I scratched behind his ears absentmindedly, letting his weight settle against me. 
That’s when it hit me.

Cigarettes.

It was faint at first, subtle enough that I almost convinced myself I was imagining it. But the more I focused on it, the stronger it got—stale, acrid, like the inside of a car where someone had been chain-smoking for years.

I frowned, leaned in, and sniffed him properly. The smell was coming from his fur.

I pulled back, wrinkling my nose. ""Dude, what the hell?""

Ace thumped his tail against the couch, completely unbothered.

I scratched my head. He hadn’t been around anyone but me, and I didn’t smoke. Neither did my girlfriend. None of my friends did, either. The only people who came over vaped, and that didn’t leave a smell like this.

I ran my hands over his coat, checking for anything he might have rolled in. Nothing. Just the smell, clinging to him like a second skin.

""You roll around in someone’s ashtray outside?"" I muttered, rubbing at my jeans where the scent had transferred. 

I didn’t think much of it. Dogs got into weird shit all the time. Maybe someone had thrown a cigarette butt into the yard, and he’d brushed up against it.

Still, it bugged me.

That evening, my girlfriend came over. She had this habit of coming in without knocking, kicking off her shoes in the doorway like she’d lived here for years. I liked that about her. Made the place feel a little less empty.

Ace trotted up to greet her, and she crouched down to scratch under his chin. ""Hey, big guy. Miss me?""

I watched, waiting for her to react, to pull back from the smell. She didn’t.

""You smell that?"" I asked, standing up.

She glanced at me. ""Smell what?""

""He reeks like cigarettes.""

She frowned, leaning in to sniff him. Then she made a face. ""Ew. Gross.""

""Right?"" I said. ""I have no idea where he got it from.""
She wiped her hands on her jeans and stood up. 

""You should give him a bath.""

That was it. No questions. No curiosity. Just an offhanded suggestion before she walked into the kitchen to grab a drink. She didn’t even seem that bothered by it.

I hesitated, feeling weirdly disappointed by that. Like I was the only one who noticed something was off.

That night, I woke up feeling watched.
Not in a paranoid way. Not in the way where you jolt up, convinced someone’s in the room with you. This was different.

It was the kind of feeling where you’re sure someone’s looking at you, even if you can’t see them. Like an itch between your shoulders, a weight on your chest, something just outside your field of vision that refuses to reveal itself.

I turned over, and my eyes landed on Ace. He was asleep at the foot of my bed, breathing steady, chest rising and falling in deep, even rhythms. 

He wasn’t looking at me. But something else was.

I stared at the darkened corners of the room, half-expecting to see something staring back.

Nothing.

Just shadows. Just my own shitty imagination.

I rolled onto my back and forced my eyes shut, willing myself to ignore it.

It was just a feeling.

But it stayed with me long after I finally fell asleep.

Chapter Three: The Chimney Stirs

The cigarette smell was stronger the next morning.
I didn’t notice it right away, not until I was pouring my coffee and Ace brushed against my leg. It hit me then—sharp, stale, like old smoke trapped in fabric.

""Dude,"" I muttered, stepping back. ""It’s worse.""

Ace yawned like he couldn’t care less.

I crouched down and sniffed again, just to be sure. It was definitely stronger. Not overpowering, but noticeable. Like he’d spent the night in a chain-smoking competition and lost on a technicality.

I rubbed my face and stood up. 

""Guess it’s bath time.""

Ace groaned in protest but didn’t move. Lazy bastard.

I was getting towels from the laundry room when I heard it.

A whistle.

Not a melody, not an intentional tune—just a faint, breathy sound, like air squeezing through a narrow gap. Like someone pursing their lips but not quite blowing.
I froze. It came from inside the wall.

The laundry room was small, just enough space for the washer, dryer, and a few shelves. The chimney was in here, too—sealed up, forgotten. I barely ever thought about it.

But now, standing in front of it, I did.
I reached out and ran my fingers over the bricks. They felt wrong.

Not bad. Not cursed. Just... off.
Some spots were too smooth, like they had been worn down by years of touch. Others were rough, almost jagged. The texture wasn’t consistent, like the bricks hadn’t all come from the same place.
I pressed my palm flat against it.
For a second, nothing happened.

Then—

A soft click.

The kind of sound a lock makes when it shifts slightly, not unlocking but adjusting.
I pulled my hand back fast.
The laundry room was still. Too still.
The whistle didn’t come again.
Ace was waiting in the hallway when I stepped out, watching me.

I hesitated. ""You hear that?""
He blinked once. Then, slowly, he turned and walked away.

Not scared. Not spooked. Just... there.
Like he had already made peace with whatever it was.

Chapter Four: The First Transfer

It was late when I let Ace outside.
The air was thick and warm, clinging to my skin like an extra layer I didn’t ask for. Crickets hummed from the grass, distant, rhythmic, indifferent. Ace trotted onto the lawn, stretching once before shaking his fur, shedding the weight of the house like it had been pressing down on him.

The second he stepped out, I knew something was wrong.

The smell didn’t leave with him.
It should have. Every time before, Ace had been the one carrying it. But now, as I stood in the doorway, the smell of cigarettes was still here. Still around me.
Then the dread hit.

Not the kind of fear that spikes in your chest and fades. This was heavier. Suffocating. Like stepping into a room where the air was too thick to breathe. Like something was waiting. Watching. Pressing in from all sides.
The entire house smelled like it now. The furniture, the walls, the air itself—like I was inside the smell.
My hands clenched into fists. My legs locked up. Something was in here with me.
I forced myself to move, to shake off the feeling, but it stuck.

Then—Ace barked.
A single, sharp noise, cutting through the weight of it all. My head snapped up.
He was at the window, ears perked, staring at me. Not scared. Not panicked. Just focused.
Like he knew.

The second I unlocked the door, he bolted inside.
And just like that, the dread was gone.
Not faded. Not drained away.
Gone.

Like a switch flipped. Like it had never been there.
But the smell—the smell didn’t vanish instantly.
It weakened. Slowly. Like it was drifting, finding its way back to where it belonged.
Back to Ace.

I swallowed, staring at him as he trotted into the living room, circling once before lying down. Like nothing had happened.

But something had.

Something was wrong.

And for the first time, I looked at Ace a little longer than usual, my mind grasping for an explanation I didn’t want to find.

Chapter Five: The Unraveling

It started with small things.

Keys not where I left them. A cabinet door open when I knew I had closed it. A glass sitting in the sink when I hadn’t used one.

Little things. Things you could write off.
At first, I did.

Then it got weirder.

I came home one evening and found the TV on—playing static. The remote was on the coffee table, untouched. Ace was asleep on the couch, head on his paws.
I stood there for a long time, staring at the screen.
Ace didn’t move. Didn’t acknowledge it.
I shut the TV off.

The next night, I woke up to find my bedroom door open. I always slept with it closed.
Ace was on the floor, right where he always was. But the air in the room felt wrong.
Like I had just missed something.

Ace’s mood had changed, too. Not in a bad way, not in any way I could describe, really. He still acted like Ace. Still sat next to me when I watched TV, still greeted me at the door, still ran to the window every time he heard a car pass. But there was something behind his eyes.

A sharpness.

A knowing.

It made my stomach twist.
I tried to shake it off, but every time I looked at him, I felt like there was something I was ignoring to see.

I told my girlfriend everything that night. About the smell. The feeling. The whistle.
She didn’t brush me off. She sat next to me, pulled her knees up to her chest, and listened.
""I don’t know what to tell you,"" she said finally. ""I believe you. I just... I don’t know what to do about it.""
I exhaled. ""I don’t either.""
She reached for my hand. She didn’t have an answer, but at least she was here.

The whistle came again the next night.
Louder. Clearer.
Ace was in the living room with me when I heard it.

The chimney was empty.

But something was still inside.

Chapter Six: The Realization

It wasn’t Ace.

I don’t know when exactly I started to realize it. Maybe it had been sitting in the back of my head for a while, waiting for me to stop looking for the wrong answers. But once the thought surfaced, it refused to leave.

It wasn’t Ace.

The smell wasn’t on him. It was following him. Like a shadow, like something waiting for its turn to move.
The objects that had been shifting—they only moved when he was in the room. But not because of him. They moved when I wasn’t looking.

The whistle wasn’t tied to him, either. He had been in the living room with me when I heard it from the chimney.

And Ace? Ace had never been afraid. Not once.
Because whatever this was, he had always known it was there. He had been carrying it, living with it, taking it with him—until the night it stayed with me instead.
I watched him sleep that night. Not out of fear, not out of paranoia—but because I was waiting to feel that presence again.

It was different this time. The weight was on me now.
Ace slept peacefully, his breaths deep and steady. He didn’t feel it anymore.
Because I did.

I swallowed, shifting in bed. The air felt thick. Like the house was watching me.

I had spent days, maybe weeks, thinking the wrong thing. Thinking it was him. But he wasn’t the one changing.

It was.

The moment Ace had stepped outside that night, the entity had stayed with me. But when he came back in, he didn’t even hesitate for a second to take it back. It had let me feel everything Ace had been carrying this entire time. And I had blamed him for it.

I tensed my jaw and gritted me teeth, staring at the ceiling. It had never been Ace I needed to fear.

It had always been whatever was lingering around me now, shifting unseen through the space we shared.
And for the first time, I let myself see it for what it was.

Chapter Seven: The Breaking Point

I opened the door and let Ace out.

He hesitated for a moment, glancing back at me before stepping onto the grass. The moment he was outside, the air inside the house shifted.

The smell was suffocating.

Thick, clinging to my skin, sinking into my clothes. It wasn’t following Ace anymore. It had settled into me, like a new layer of existence, pressing against my ribs and weighing down my breath. It was inside the house now, inside me.

Ace stood outside now, staring at me through the open door. His ears twitched, but he didn’t move. He was willing to come back in—waiting for me to decide. He was giving me the choice.

I stepped forward, but my legs didn’t want to work. Every instinct screamed at me to stay, to let it consume me, to sink into it until I didn’t have to think anymore.
I forced myself to step forward, to push against the weight, against the thing clawing at my ribs. It fought me. But I fought harder.

The second I stepped outside, it was gone.
No smell. No weight. No presence.
The night air was cool against my skin, and for the first time in weeks, I felt like I could breathe.
I sucked in air, hands on my knees, staring at the ground. I was free.

Ace sat beside me, watching.
Then the thought hit me.

It didn’t leave.

My stomach twisted. It wasn’t gone—it was still inside.
And there was only one other person in there with it.
I turned back toward the house.
I lifted Ace over the fence first, placing him on the other side. He didn’t fight me. He just stared, waiting, watching.

I was supposed to run.

I almost did.

But I couldn’t leave her in there.

I pushed the door open. The second I stepped inside, the smell returned, punching the air from my lungs. The dread slithered back into my bones, wrapping itself around my spine.

She was sitting on the couch, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling through her phone like it was just another night. The glow from the screen lit up her face in soft blues and whites, casting shifting shadows that made her look like a memory I was already forgetting. For a split second, I wondered if she even knew I had walked back in. If she had felt the change in the air, the way the house had settled into something different. Or if she had been absorbed into it already, part of the emptiness.

""We have to go,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Now.""
She frowned. ""What?""

I couldn’t explain. I couldn’t make her understand. I just needed her to leave.

""I’m serious. I—"" I swallowed. ""I think we should break up.""

She blinked. ""Wait, what?""

""I need you to go. Now.""

Her expression twisted, hurt flashing across her face before hardening into something unreadable. I didn’t care. I just needed her to leave.

She grabbed her things without another word, shaking her head as she stormed toward the door.

I followed, watching, waiting—

The second she stepped through the threshold, Ace ran past me, bolting back inside.

I barely had time to register what was happening before she crossed the doorway.

And then—

The house exhaled.

Not a sound, not a movement, but something deeper, something felt in the marrow. Like the walls had been waiting for this exact moment. Like it had all been leading to this.

The air collapsed in on itself, folding, twisting, turning inside out. The space between seconds stretched and thinned, the room warping like light through heat. The doorway was no longer just a doorway. It was a threshold in the truest sense—a dividing line between what was real and what wasn’t.

My breath hitched. Something peeled away.
The walls bent. The floor trembled. Or maybe I did.
Ace was already inside, disappearing into the darkness as if he had never left at all. My girlfriend—she was still stepping through, her foot frozen midair like time had stuttered, like reality wasn’t sure how to let her leave.

And then it did.

She was gone.

And everything else went with her.

Chapter Eight: The Void

There was nothing.
No air, no walls, no ground beneath my feet. Just an absence so absolute that my body no longer felt like a body. I was here, but I wasn’t.

I tried to move, but there was nowhere to move to.
I tried to breathe, but there was nothing to breathe in.
There was only Ace.

He sat beside me—or maybe he didn’t. Maybe he was part of me now, or I was part of him. It didn’t matter. He was here. We were here.

I don’t know how long we stayed like that. A second? A thousand years? Time didn’t exist anymore, but we existed within it.

I held onto my name at first. My shape. My thoughts. But they were slipping, unraveling thread by thread, breaking down into something smaller, something quieter. Like I was dissolving into the nothing around me.

And Ace—he didn’t fight it.

Because he never had to.

He had always known. He had always accepted.
I think I laughed then, or maybe I cried. Or maybe I did neither. Maybe I just let go.

Ace shifted—or maybe I did. There was no difference anymore.

We weren’t separate. We weren’t anything.
We had always been here.

And somewhere, in the unraveling threads of my fading thoughts, I remembered thinking once—long ago, or maybe just a second ago—that the chimney wasn’t just a chimney.

Maybe you have too.

But this anecdote I'm about to share, definitely has me asking questions.

My wife (DW) is currently pregnant, and a common effect of being pregnant is gaining the power of (what we call) ""super smell"". [This article that says two thirds of woman experience this hyperosmia, or heightened sense of smell during pregnancy.](https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy/your-body/heightened-sense-of-smell-during-pregnancy_40009100) It might also be characterised as having ""food aversions"" because for some women they suddenly develop aversions to foods which they previously enjoyed. Sometimes smells are triggers for nausea and vomiting, etc..

Anyways, so we have been trying to understand what triggers these smells, and obviously avoid the worse smells. In doing so we have learnt some things along the way: 

1.DW used to love eggs fried in canola / vegetable oil, however, since being pregnant she can't stand it. Heating vegetable oil in a pan smells disgusting and rancid to her. Honestly, before I experienced her aversion to the vegetable oil I never would've believed vegetable oil could be rancid. It doesn't look or smell rancid to me, but she now hates it with a strong passion. Cooking in butter smells fine to her.

2. I recently bought a bag of coffee beans and had them ground at the shop. For the first few days , up until a week, DW did not mind the smell of me making coffee. However after 1week+, the coffee smelled unbearably disgusting to her.

3. Bags of pre-chopped veggies or precut salad smell gross to her as well. However, food prepared with fresh vegetables is typically better / okay.

A hypothesis is forming in my head. I am starting to believe that she is extremely sensitive to the smell of oxidation products. The oxidised coffee, the oxidised pre-chopped veggies, and the oxidised canola oil. We have stopped using vegetable oil / canola oil at home , and surely that is a good thing. Many virgin/unprocessed oils have naturally occurring antioxidants contained within them, and I can imagine that would be important to support health. ",8,1738697229.0,SaturatedFat,1,1.0,False

The house wasn’t anything special. Two bedrooms, a laundry room that smelled like detergent and old wood, a backyard big enough for Ace to run around in. It was the kind of place you rented when you didn’t have the money for something better but still wanted a place to call your own. A fixer-upper, as the landlord had called it. But as far as I could tell, nothing really needed fixing.
Except the chimney.

""Previous owner sealed it up years ago,"" the landlord had mentioned offhandedly during the walk-through. 

""Best to just leave it alone.""

I barely registered the comment at the time. I didn’t care about the chimney. I wasn’t the kind of person who sat in front of a fire with a glass of whiskey, contemplating life. If anything, I liked that it was sealed up. Less maintenance.

Ace had taken to the place immediately. He ran through every room like he was cataloging them, sniffing every inch, claiming every corner. A mutt with a bruiser’s build—part pit, part shepherd, part Rottweiler—he was the kind of dog that looked like trouble but was more likely to curl up next to you than bite.

""Feels weird,"" 
my girlfriend had said when she first stepped inside, her arms crossed as she scanned the walls. 
""Like… I don’t know. Old.""

""It is old,"" I said. ""That’s kind of the point. Cheap rent.""

She made a face, but didn’t push it. She wasn’t the type to argue over things that didn’t really matter.
She didn’t move in with me, but she stayed over more often than not. I liked having her around. Even when she was quiet, there was something grounding about her presence. Like an anchor to reality, a reminder that even if I was alone in this place, I wasn’t actually alone.

That first night was restless. Not because anything happened, but because I couldn’t quite shake the feeling that I’d forgotten something. Like when you leave the house and feel like your keys aren’t in your pocket, even though they are.

Ace slept fine. I should’ve taken a lesson from him.

I didn’t think about the chimney again. I didn’t think about anything, really. It was just a house.

For now.

Chapter Two: The First Sign

It was a couple of days before I noticed the smell.

I was sitting on the couch, half-listening to a podcast while scrolling on my phone, when Ace climbed up next to me and flopped his head onto my lap. I scratched behind his ears absentmindedly, letting his weight settle against me. 
That’s when it hit me.

Cigarettes.

It was faint at first, subtle enough that I almost convinced myself I was imagining it. But the more I focused on it, the stronger it got—stale, acrid, like the inside of a car where someone had been chain-smoking for years.

I frowned, leaned in, and sniffed him properly. The smell was coming from his fur.

I pulled back, wrinkling my nose. ""Dude, what the hell?""

Ace thumped his tail against the couch, completely unbothered.

I scratched my head. He hadn’t been around anyone but me, and I didn’t smoke. Neither did my girlfriend. None of my friends did, either. The only people who came over vaped, and that didn’t leave a smell like this.

I ran my hands over his coat, checking for anything he might have rolled in. Nothing. Just the smell, clinging to him like a second skin.

""You roll around in someone’s ashtray outside?"" I muttered, rubbing at my jeans where the scent had transferred. 

I didn’t think much of it. Dogs got into weird shit all the time. Maybe someone had thrown a cigarette butt into the yard, and he’d brushed up against it.

Still, it bugged me.

That evening, my girlfriend came over. She had this habit of coming in without knocking, kicking off her shoes in the doorway like she’d lived here for years. I liked that about her. Made the place feel a little less empty.

Ace trotted up to greet her, and she crouched down to scratch under his chin. ""Hey, big guy. Miss me?""

I watched, waiting for her to react, to pull back from the smell. She didn’t.

""You smell that?"" I asked, standing up.

She glanced at me. ""Smell what?""

""He reeks like cigarettes.""

She frowned, leaning in to sniff him. Then she made a face. ""Ew. Gross.""

""Right?"" I said. ""I have no idea where he got it from.""
She wiped her hands on her jeans and stood up. 

""You should give him a bath.""

That was it. No questions. No curiosity. Just an offhanded suggestion before she walked into the kitchen to grab a drink. She didn’t even seem that bothered by it.

I hesitated, feeling weirdly disappointed by that. Like I was the only one who noticed something was off.

That night, I woke up feeling watched.
Not in a paranoid way. Not in the way where you jolt up, convinced someone’s in the room with you. This was different.

It was the kind of feeling where you’re sure someone’s looking at you, even if you can’t see them. Like an itch between your shoulders, a weight on your chest, something just outside your field of vision that refuses to reveal itself.

I turned over, and my eyes landed on Ace. He was asleep at the foot of my bed, breathing steady, chest rising and falling in deep, even rhythms. 

He wasn’t looking at me. But something else was.

I stared at the darkened corners of the room, half-expecting to see something staring back.

Nothing.

Just shadows. Just my own shitty imagination.

I rolled onto my back and forced my eyes shut, willing myself to ignore it.

It was just a feeling.

But it stayed with me long after I finally fell asleep.

Chapter Three: The Chimney Stirs

The cigarette smell was stronger the next morning.
I didn’t notice it right away, not until I was pouring my coffee and Ace brushed against my leg. It hit me then—sharp, stale, like old smoke trapped in fabric.

""Dude,"" I muttered, stepping back. ""It’s worse.""

Ace yawned like he couldn’t care less.

I crouched down and sniffed again, just to be sure. It was definitely stronger. Not overpowering, but noticeable. Like he’d spent the night in a chain-smoking competition and lost on a technicality.

I rubbed my face and stood up. 

""Guess it’s bath time.""

Ace groaned in protest but didn’t move. Lazy bastard.

I was getting towels from the laundry room when I heard it.

A whistle.

Not a melody, not an intentional tune—just a faint, breathy sound, like air squeezing through a narrow gap. Like someone pursing their lips but not quite blowing.
I froze. It came from inside the wall.

The laundry room was small, just enough space for the washer, dryer, and a few shelves. The chimney was in here, too—sealed up, forgotten. I barely ever thought about it.

But now, standing in front of it, I did.
I reached out and ran my fingers over the bricks. They felt wrong.

Not bad. Not cursed. Just... off.
Some spots were too smooth, like they had been worn down by years of touch. Others were rough, almost jagged. The texture wasn’t consistent, like the bricks hadn’t all come from the same place.
I pressed my palm flat against it.
For a second, nothing happened.

Then—

A soft click.

The kind of sound a lock makes when it shifts slightly, not unlocking but adjusting.
I pulled my hand back fast.
The laundry room was still. Too still.
The whistle didn’t come again.
Ace was waiting in the hallway when I stepped out, watching me.

I hesitated. ""You hear that?""
He blinked once. Then, slowly, he turned and walked away.

Not scared. Not spooked. Just... there.
Like he had already made peace with whatever it was.

Chapter Four: The First Transfer

It was late when I let Ace outside.
The air was thick and warm, clinging to my skin like an extra layer I didn’t ask for. Crickets hummed from the grass, distant, rhythmic, indifferent. Ace trotted onto the lawn, stretching once before shaking his fur, shedding the weight of the house like it had been pressing down on him.

The second he stepped out, I knew something was wrong.

The smell didn’t leave with him.
It should have. Every time before, Ace had been the one carrying it. But now, as I stood in the doorway, the smell of cigarettes was still here. Still around me.

I don’t know when exactly I started to realize it. Maybe it had been sitting in the back of my head for a while, waiting for me to stop looking for the wrong answers. But once the thought surfaced, it refused to leave.

It wasn’t Ace.

The smell wasn’t on him. It was following him. Like a shadow, like something waiting for its turn to move.
The objects that had been shifting—they only moved when he was in the room. But not because of him. They moved when I wasn’t looking.

The whistle wasn’t tied to him, either. He had been in the living room with me when I heard it from the chimney.

And Ace? Ace had never been afraid. Not once.
Because whatever this was, he had always known it was there. He had been carrying it, living with it, taking it with him—until the night it stayed with me instead.
I watched him sleep that night. Not out of fear, not out of paranoia—but because I was waiting to feel that presence again.

It was different this time. The weight was on me now.
Ace slept peacefully, his breaths deep and steady. He didn’t feel it anymore.
Because I did.

I swallowed, shifting in bed. The air felt thick. Like the house was watching me.

I had spent days, maybe weeks, thinking the wrong thing. Thinking it was him. But he wasn’t the one changing.

It was.

The moment Ace had stepped outside that night, the entity had stayed with me. But when he came back in, he didn’t even hesitate for a second to take it back. It had let me feel everything Ace had been carrying this entire time. And I had blamed him for it.

I tensed my jaw and gritted me teeth, staring at the ceiling. It had never been Ace I needed to fear.

It had always been whatever was lingering around me now, shifting unseen through the space we shared.
And for the first time, I let myself see it for what it was.

Chapter Seven: The Breaking Point

I opened the door and let Ace out.

He hesitated for a moment, glancing back at me before stepping onto the grass. The moment he was outside, the air inside the house shifted.

The smell was suffocating.

Thick, clinging to my skin, sinking into my clothes. It wasn’t following Ace anymore. It had settled into me, like a new layer of existence, pressing against my ribs and weighing down my breath. It was inside the house now, inside me.

Ace stood outside now, staring at me through the open door. His ears twitched, but he didn’t move. He was willing to come back in—waiting for me to decide. He was giving me the choice.

I stepped forward, but my legs didn’t want to work. Every instinct screamed at me to stay, to let it consume me, to sink into it until I didn’t have to think anymore.
I forced myself to step forward, to push against the weight, against the thing clawing at my ribs. It fought me. But I fought harder.

The second I stepped outside, it was gone.
No smell. No weight. No presence.
The night air was cool against my skin, and for the first time in weeks, I felt like I could breathe.
I sucked in air, hands on my knees, staring at the ground. I was free.

Ace sat beside me, watching.
Then the thought hit me.

It didn’t leave.

My stomach twisted. It wasn’t gone—it was still inside.
And there was only one other person in there with it.
I turned back toward the house.
I lifted Ace over the fence first, placing him on the other side. He didn’t fight me. He just stared, waiting, watching.

I was supposed to run.

I almost did.

But I couldn’t leave her in there.

I pushed the door open. The second I stepped inside, the smell returned, punching the air from my lungs. The dread slithered back into my bones, wrapping itself around my spine.

She was sitting on the couch, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling through her phone like it was just another night. The glow from the screen lit up her face in soft blues and whites, casting shifting shadows that made her look like a memory I was already forgetting. For a split second, I wondered if she even knew I had walked back in. If she had felt the change in the air, the way the house had settled into something different. Or if she had been absorbed into it already, part of the emptiness.

""We have to go,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Now.""
She frowned. ""What?""

I couldn’t explain. I couldn’t make her understand. I just needed her to leave.

""I’m serious. I—"" I swallowed. ""I think we should break up.""

She blinked. ""Wait, what?""

""I need you to go. Now.""

Her expression twisted, hurt flashing across her face before hardening into something unreadable. I didn’t care. I just needed her to leave.

She grabbed her things without another word, shaking her head as she stormed toward the door.

I followed, watching, waiting—

The second she stepped through the threshold, Ace ran past me, bolting back inside.

I barely had time to register what was happening before she crossed the doorway.

And then—

The house exhaled.

Not a sound, not a movement, but something deeper, something felt in the marrow. Like the walls had been waiting for this exact moment. Like it had all been leading to this.

The air collapsed in on itself, folding, twisting, turning inside out. The space between seconds stretched and thinned, the room warping like light through heat. The doorway was no longer just a doorway. It was a threshold in the truest sense—a dividing line between what was real and what wasn’t.

My breath hitched. Something peeled away.
The walls bent. The floor trembled. Or maybe I did.
Ace was already inside, disappearing into the darkness as if he had never left at all. My girlfriend—she was still stepping through, her foot frozen midair like time had stuttered, like reality wasn’t sure how to let her leave.

And then it did.

She was gone.

And everything else went with her.

Chapter Eight: The Void

There was nothing.
No air, no walls, no ground beneath my feet. Just an absence so absolute that my body no longer felt like a body. I was here, but I wasn’t.

I tried to move, but there was nowhere to move to.
I tried to breathe, but there was nothing to breathe in.
There was only Ace.

He sat beside me—or maybe he didn’t. Maybe he was part of me now, or I was part of him. It didn’t matter. He was here. We were here.

I don’t know how long we stayed like that. A second? A thousand years? Time didn’t exist anymore, but we existed within it.

I held onto my name at first. My shape. My thoughts. But they were slipping, unraveling thread by thread, breaking down into something smaller, something quieter. Like I was dissolving into the nothing around me.

And Ace—he didn’t fight it.

Because he never had to.

He had always known. He had always accepted.
I think I laughed then, or maybe I cried. Or maybe I did neither. Maybe I just let go.

Ace shifted—or maybe I did. There was no difference anymore.

We weren’t separate. We weren’t anything.
We had always been here.

And somewhere, in the unraveling threads of my fading thoughts, I remembered thinking once—long ago, or maybe just a second ago—that the chimney wasn’t just a chimney.

Maybe you have too.

The house wasn’t anything special. Two bedrooms, a laundry room that smelled like detergent and old wood, a backyard big enough for Ace to run around in. It was the kind of place you rented when you didn’t have the money for something better but still wanted a place to call your own. A fixer-upper, as the landlord had called it. But as far as I could tell, nothing really needed fixing.
Except the chimney.

""Previous owner sealed it up years ago,"" the landlord had mentioned offhandedly during the walk-through. 

""Best to just leave it alone.""

I barely registered the comment at the time. I didn’t care about the chimney. I wasn’t the kind of person who sat in front of a fire with a glass of whiskey, contemplating life. If anything, I liked that it was sealed up. Less maintenance.

Ace had taken to the place immediately. He ran through every room like he was cataloging them, sniffing every inch, claiming every corner. A mutt with a bruiser’s build—part pit, part shepherd, part Rottweiler—he was the kind of dog that looked like trouble but was more likely to curl up next to you than bite.

""Feels weird,"" 
my girlfriend had said when she first stepped inside, her arms crossed as she scanned the walls. 
""Like… I don’t know. Old.""

""It is old,"" I said. ""That’s kind of the point. Cheap rent.""

She made a face, but didn’t push it. She wasn’t the type to argue over things that didn’t really matter.
She didn’t move in with me, but she stayed over more often than not. I liked having her around. Even when she was quiet, there was something grounding about her presence. Like an anchor to reality, a reminder that even if I was alone in this place, I wasn’t actually alone.

That first night was restless. Not because anything happened, but because I couldn’t quite shake the feeling that I’d forgotten something. Like when you leave the house and feel like your keys aren’t in your pocket, even though they are.

Ace slept fine. I should’ve taken a lesson from him.

I didn’t think about the chimney again. I didn’t think about anything, really. It was just a house.

For now.

Chapter Two: The First Sign

It was a couple of days before I noticed the smell.

I was sitting on the couch, half-listening to a podcast while scrolling on my phone, when Ace climbed up next to me and flopped his head onto my lap. I scratched behind his ears absentmindedly, letting his weight settle against me. 
That’s when it hit me.

Cigarettes.

It was faint at first, subtle enough that I almost convinced myself I was imagining it. But the more I focused on it, the stronger it got—stale, acrid, like the inside of a car where someone had been chain-smoking for years.

I frowned, leaned in, and sniffed him properly. The smell was coming from his fur.

I pulled back, wrinkling my nose. ""Dude, what the hell?""

Ace thumped his tail against the couch, completely unbothered.

I scratched my head. He hadn’t been around anyone but me, and I didn’t smoke. Neither did my girlfriend. None of my friends did, either. The only people who came over vaped, and that didn’t leave a smell like this.

I ran my hands over his coat, checking for anything he might have rolled in. Nothing. Just the smell, clinging to him like a second skin.

""You roll around in someone’s ashtray outside?"" I muttered, rubbing at my jeans where the scent had transferred. 

I didn’t think much of it. Dogs got into weird shit all the time. Maybe someone had thrown a cigarette butt into the yard, and he’d brushed up against it.

Still, it bugged me.

That evening, my girlfriend came over. She had this habit of coming in without knocking, kicking off her shoes in the doorway like she’d lived here for years. I liked that about her. Made the place feel a little less empty.

Ace trotted up to greet her, and she crouched down to scratch under his chin. ""Hey, big guy. Miss me?""

I watched, waiting for her to react, to pull back from the smell. She didn’t.

""You smell that?"" I asked, standing up.

She glanced at me. ""Smell what?""

""He reeks like cigarettes.""

She frowned, leaning in to sniff him. Then she made a face. ""Ew. Gross.""

""Right?"" I said. ""I have no idea where he got it from.""
She wiped her hands on her jeans and stood up. 

""You should give him a bath.""

That was it. No questions. No curiosity. Just an offhanded suggestion before she walked into the kitchen to grab a drink. She didn’t even seem that bothered by it.

I hesitated, feeling weirdly disappointed by that. Like I was the only one who noticed something was off.

That night, I woke up feeling watched.
Not in a paranoid way. Not in the way where you jolt up, convinced someone’s in the room with you. This was different.

It was the kind of feeling where you’re sure someone’s looking at you, even if you can’t see them. Like an itch between your shoulders, a weight on your chest, something just outside your field of vision that refuses to reveal itself.

I turned over, and my eyes landed on Ace. He was asleep at the foot of my bed, breathing steady, chest rising and falling in deep, even rhythms. 

He wasn’t looking at me. But something else was.

I stared at the darkened corners of the room, half-expecting to see something staring back.

Nothing.

Just shadows. Just my own shitty imagination.

I rolled onto my back and forced my eyes shut, willing myself to ignore it.

It was just a feeling.

But it stayed with me long after I finally fell asleep.

Chapter Three: The Chimney Stirs

The cigarette smell was stronger the next morning.
I didn’t notice it right away, not until I was pouring my coffee and Ace brushed against my leg. It hit me then—sharp, stale, like old smoke trapped in fabric.

""Dude,"" I muttered, stepping back. ""It’s worse.""

Ace yawned like he couldn’t care less.

I crouched down and sniffed again, just to be sure. It was definitely stronger. Not overpowering, but noticeable. Like he’d spent the night in a chain-smoking competition and lost on a technicality.

I rubbed my face and stood up. 

""Guess it’s bath time.""

Ace groaned in protest but didn’t move. Lazy bastard.

I was getting towels from the laundry room when I heard it.

A whistle.

Not a melody, not an intentional tune—just a faint, breathy sound, like air squeezing through a narrow gap. Like someone pursing their lips but not quite blowing.
I froze. It came from inside the wall.

The laundry room was small, just enough space for the washer, dryer, and a few shelves. The chimney was in here, too—sealed up, forgotten. I barely ever thought about it.

But now, standing in front of it, I did.
I reached out and ran my fingers over the bricks. They felt wrong.

Not bad. Not cursed. Just... off.
Some spots were too smooth, like they had been worn down by years of touch. Others were rough, almost jagged. The texture wasn’t consistent, like the bricks hadn’t all come from the same place.
I pressed my palm flat against it.
For a second, nothing happened.

Then—

A soft click.

The kind of sound a lock makes when it shifts slightly, not unlocking but adjusting.
I pulled my hand back fast.
The laundry room was still. Too still.
The whistle didn’t come again.
Ace was waiting in the hallway when I stepped out, watching me.

I hesitated. ""You hear that?""
He blinked once. Then, slowly, he turned and walked away.

Not scared. Not spooked. Just... there.
Like he had already made peace with whatever it was.

Chapter Four: The First Transfer

It was late when I let Ace outside.
The air was thick and warm, clinging to my skin like an extra layer I didn’t ask for. Crickets hummed from the grass, distant, rhythmic, indifferent. Ace trotted onto the lawn, stretching once before shaking his fur, shedding the weight of the house like it had been pressing down on him.

The second he stepped out, I knew something was wrong.

The smell didn’t leave with him.
It should have. Every time before, Ace had been the one carrying it. But now, as I stood in the doorway, the smell of cigarettes was still here. Still around me.
Then the dread hit.

Not the kind of fear that spikes in your chest and fades. This was heavier. Suffocating. Like stepping into a room where the air was too thick to breathe. Like something was waiting. Watching. Pressing in from all sides.
The entire house smelled like it now. The furniture, the walls, the air itself—like I was inside the smell.
My hands clenched into fists. My legs locked up. Something was in here with me.
I forced myself to move, to shake off the feeling, but it stuck.

Then—Ace barked.
A single, sharp noise, cutting through the weight of it all. My head snapped up.
He was at the window, ears perked, staring at me. Not scared. Not panicked. Just focused.
Like he knew.

The second I unlocked the door, he bolted inside.
And just like that, the dread was gone.
Not faded. Not drained away.
Gone.

Like a switch flipped. Like it had never been there.
But the smell—the smell didn’t vanish instantly.
It weakened. Slowly. Like it was drifting, finding its way back to where it belonged.
Back to Ace.

I swallowed, staring at him as he trotted into the living room, circling once before lying down. Like nothing had happened.

But something had.

Something was wrong.

And for the first time, I looked at Ace a little longer than usual, my mind grasping for an explanation I didn’t want to find.

Chapter Five: The Unraveling

It started with small things.

Keys not where I left them. A cabinet door open when I knew I had closed it. A glass sitting in the sink when I hadn’t used one.

Little things. Things you could write off.
At first, I did.

Then it got weirder.

I came home one evening and found the TV on—playing static. The remote was on the coffee table, untouched. Ace was asleep on the couch, head on his paws.
I stood there for a long time, staring at the screen.
Ace didn’t move. Didn’t acknowledge it.
I shut the TV off.

The next night, I woke up to find my bedroom door open. I always slept with it closed.
Ace was on the floor, right where he always was. But the air in the room felt wrong.
Like I had just missed something.

Ace’s mood had changed, too. Not in a bad way, not in any way I could describe, really. He still acted like Ace. Still sat next to me when I watched TV, still greeted me at the door, still ran to the window every time he heard a car pass. But there was something behind his eyes.

A sharpness.

A knowing.

It made my stomach twist.
I tried to shake it off, but every time I looked at him, I felt like there was something I was ignoring to see.

I told my girlfriend everything that night. About the smell. The feeling. The whistle.
She didn’t brush me off. She sat next to me, pulled her knees up to her chest, and listened.
""I don’t know what to tell you,"" she said finally. ""I believe you. I just... I don’t know what to do about it.""
I exhaled. ""I don’t either.""
She reached for my hand. She didn’t have an answer, but at least she was here.

The whistle came again the next night.
Louder. Clearer.
Ace was in the living room with me when I heard it.

The chimney was empty.

But something was still inside.

Chapter Six: The Realization

It wasn’t Ace.

I don’t know when exactly I started to realize it. Maybe it had been sitting in the back of my head for a while, waiting for me to stop looking for the wrong answers. But once the thought surfaced, it refused to leave.

I scratched my head. He hadn’t been around anyone but me, and I didn’t smoke. Neither did my girlfriend. None of my friends did, either. The only people who came over vaped, and that didn’t leave a smell like this.

I ran my hands over his coat, checking for anything he might have rolled in. Nothing. Just the smell, clinging to him like a second skin.

""You roll around in someone’s ashtray outside?"" I muttered, rubbing at my jeans where the scent had transferred. 

I didn’t think much of it. Dogs got into weird shit all the time. Maybe someone had thrown a cigarette butt into the yard, and he’d brushed up against it.

Still, it bugged me.

That evening, my girlfriend came over. She had this habit of coming in without knocking, kicking off her shoes in the doorway like she’d lived here for years. I liked that about her. Made the place feel a little less empty.

Ace trotted up to greet her, and she crouched down to scratch under his chin. ""Hey, big guy. Miss me?""

I watched, waiting for her to react, to pull back from the smell. She didn’t.

""You smell that?"" I asked, standing up.

She glanced at me. ""Smell what?""

""He reeks like cigarettes.""

She frowned, leaning in to sniff him. Then she made a face. ""Ew. Gross.""

""Right?"" I said. ""I have no idea where he got it from.""
She wiped her hands on her jeans and stood up. 

""You should give him a bath.""

That was it. No questions. No curiosity. Just an offhanded suggestion before she walked into the kitchen to grab a drink. She didn’t even seem that bothered by it.

I hesitated, feeling weirdly disappointed by that. Like I was the only one who noticed something was off.

That night, I woke up feeling watched.
Not in a paranoid way. Not in the way where you jolt up, convinced someone’s in the room with you. This was different.

It was the kind of feeling where you’re sure someone’s looking at you, even if you can’t see them. Like an itch between your shoulders, a weight on your chest, something just outside your field of vision that refuses to reveal itself.

I turned over, and my eyes landed on Ace. He was asleep at the foot of my bed, breathing steady, chest rising and falling in deep, even rhythms. 

He wasn’t looking at me. But something else was.

I stared at the darkened corners of the room, half-expecting to see something staring back.

Nothing.

Just shadows. Just my own shitty imagination.

I rolled onto my back and forced my eyes shut, willing myself to ignore it.

It was just a feeling.

But it stayed with me long after I finally fell asleep.

Chapter Three: The Chimney Stirs

The cigarette smell was stronger the next morning.
I didn’t notice it right away, not until I was pouring my coffee and Ace brushed against my leg. It hit me then—sharp, stale, like old smoke trapped in fabric.

""Dude,"" I muttered, stepping back. ""It’s worse.""

Ace yawned like he couldn’t care less.

I crouched down and sniffed again, just to be sure. It was definitely stronger. Not overpowering, but noticeable. Like he’d spent the night in a chain-smoking competition and lost on a technicality.

I rubbed my face and stood up. 

""Guess it’s bath time.""

Ace groaned in protest but didn’t move. Lazy bastard.

I was getting towels from the laundry room when I heard it.

A whistle.

Not a melody, not an intentional tune—just a faint, breathy sound, like air squeezing through a narrow gap. Like someone pursing their lips but not quite blowing.
I froze. It came from inside the wall.

The laundry room was small, just enough space for the washer, dryer, and a few shelves. The chimney was in here, too—sealed up, forgotten. I barely ever thought about it.

But now, standing in front of it, I did.
I reached out and ran my fingers over the bricks. They felt wrong.

Not bad. Not cursed. Just... off.
Some spots were too smooth, like they had been worn down by years of touch. Others were rough, almost jagged. The texture wasn’t consistent, like the bricks hadn’t all come from the same place.
I pressed my palm flat against it.
For a second, nothing happened.

Then—

A soft click.

The kind of sound a lock makes when it shifts slightly, not unlocking but adjusting.
I pulled my hand back fast.
The laundry room was still. Too still.
The whistle didn’t come again.
Ace was waiting in the hallway when I stepped out, watching me.

I hesitated. ""You hear that?""
He blinked once. Then, slowly, he turned and walked away.

Not scared. Not spooked. Just... there.
Like he had already made peace with whatever it was.

Chapter Four: The First Transfer

It was late when I let Ace outside.
The air was thick and warm, clinging to my skin like an extra layer I didn’t ask for. Crickets hummed from the grass, distant, rhythmic, indifferent. Ace trotted onto the lawn, stretching once before shaking his fur, shedding the weight of the house like it had been pressing down on him.

The second he stepped out, I knew something was wrong.

The smell didn’t leave with him.
It should have. Every time before, Ace had been the one carrying it. But now, as I stood in the doorway, the smell of cigarettes was still here. Still around me.
Then the dread hit.

Not the kind of fear that spikes in your chest and fades. This was heavier. Suffocating. Like stepping into a room where the air was too thick to breathe. Like something was waiting. Watching. Pressing in from all sides.
The entire house smelled like it now. The furniture, the walls, the air itself—like I was inside the smell.
My hands clenched into fists. My legs locked up. Something was in here with me.
I forced myself to move, to shake off the feeling, but it stuck.

Then—Ace barked.
A single, sharp noise, cutting through the weight of it all. My head snapped up.
He was at the window, ears perked, staring at me. Not scared. Not panicked. Just focused.
Like he knew.

The second I unlocked the door, he bolted inside.
And just like that, the dread was gone.
Not faded. Not drained away.
Gone.

Like a switch flipped. Like it had never been there.
But the smell—the smell didn’t vanish instantly.
It weakened. Slowly. Like it was drifting, finding its way back to where it belonged.
Back to Ace.

I swallowed, staring at him as he trotted into the living room, circling once before lying down. Like nothing had happened.

But something had.

Something was wrong.

And for the first time, I looked at Ace a little longer than usual, my mind grasping for an explanation I didn’t want to find.

Chapter Five: The Unraveling

It started with small things.

Keys not where I left them. A cabinet door open when I knew I had closed it. A glass sitting in the sink when I hadn’t used one.

Little things. Things you could write off.
At first, I did.

Then it got weirder.

I came home one evening and found the TV on—playing static. The remote was on the coffee table, untouched. Ace was asleep on the couch, head on his paws.
I stood there for a long time, staring at the screen.
Ace didn’t move. Didn’t acknowledge it.
I shut the TV off.

The next night, I woke up to find my bedroom door open. I always slept with it closed.
Ace was on the floor, right where he always was. But the air in the room felt wrong.
Like I had just missed something.

Ace’s mood had changed, too. Not in a bad way, not in any way I could describe, really. He still acted like Ace. Still sat next to me when I watched TV, still greeted me at the door, still ran to the window every time he heard a car pass. But there was something behind his eyes.

A sharpness.

A knowing.

It made my stomach twist.
I tried to shake it off, but every time I looked at him, I felt like there was something I was ignoring to see.

I told my girlfriend everything that night. About the smell. The feeling. The whistle.
She didn’t brush me off. She sat next to me, pulled her knees up to her chest, and listened.
""I don’t know what to tell you,"" she said finally. ""I believe you. I just... I don’t know what to do about it.""
I exhaled. ""I don’t either.""
She reached for my hand. She didn’t have an answer, but at least she was here.

The whistle came again the next night.
Louder. Clearer.
Ace was in the living room with me when I heard it.

The chimney was empty.

But something was still inside.

Chapter Six: The Realization

It wasn’t Ace.

I don’t know when exactly I started to realize it. Maybe it had been sitting in the back of my head for a while, waiting for me to stop looking for the wrong answers. But once the thought surfaced, it refused to leave.

It wasn’t Ace.

The smell wasn’t on him. It was following him. Like a shadow, like something waiting for its turn to move.
The objects that had been shifting—they only moved when he was in the room. But not because of him. They moved when I wasn’t looking.

The whistle wasn’t tied to him, either. He had been in the living room with me when I heard it from the chimney.

And Ace? Ace had never been afraid. Not once.
Because whatever this was, he had always known it was there. He had been carrying it, living with it, taking it with him—until the night it stayed with me instead.
I watched him sleep that night. Not out of fear, not out of paranoia—but because I was waiting to feel that presence again.

It was different this time. The weight was on me now.
Ace slept peacefully, his breaths deep and steady. He didn’t feel it anymore.
Because I did.

I swallowed, shifting in bed. The air felt thick. Like the house was watching me.

I had spent days, maybe weeks, thinking the wrong thing. Thinking it was him. But he wasn’t the one changing.

It was.

The moment Ace had stepped outside that night, the entity had stayed with me. But when he came back in, he didn’t even hesitate for a second to take it back. It had let me feel everything Ace had been carrying this entire time. And I had blamed him for it.

I tensed my jaw and gritted me teeth, staring at the ceiling. It had never been Ace I needed to fear.

It had always been whatever was lingering around me now, shifting unseen through the space we shared.
And for the first time, I let myself see it for what it was.

Chapter Seven: The Breaking Point

I opened the door and let Ace out.

He hesitated for a moment, glancing back at me before stepping onto the grass. The moment he was outside, the air inside the house shifted.

The smell was suffocating.

Thick, clinging to my skin, sinking into my clothes. It wasn’t following Ace anymore. It had settled into me, like a new layer of existence, pressing against my ribs and weighing down my breath. It was inside the house now, inside me.

Ace stood outside now, staring at me through the open door. His ears twitched, but he didn’t move. He was willing to come back in—waiting for me to decide. He was giving me the choice.

I stepped forward, but my legs didn’t want to work. Every instinct screamed at me to stay, to let it consume me, to sink into it until I didn’t have to think anymore.
I forced myself to step forward, to push against the weight, against the thing clawing at my ribs. It fought me. But I fought harder.

The second I stepped outside, it was gone.
No smell. No weight. No presence.
The night air was cool against my skin, and for the first time in weeks, I felt like I could breathe.
I sucked in air, hands on my knees, staring at the ground. I was free.

Ace sat beside me, watching.
Then the thought hit me.

It didn’t leave.

My stomach twisted. It wasn’t gone—it was still inside.
And there was only one other person in there with it.
I turned back toward the house.
I lifted Ace over the fence first, placing him on the other side. He didn’t fight me. He just stared, waiting, watching.

I was supposed to run.

I almost did.

But I couldn’t leave her in there.

I pushed the door open. The second I stepped inside, the smell returned, punching the air from my lungs. The dread slithered back into my bones, wrapping itself around my spine.

She was sitting on the couch, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling through her phone like it was just another night. The glow from the screen lit up her face in soft blues and whites, casting shifting shadows that made her look like a memory I was already forgetting. For a split second, I wondered if she even knew I had walked back in. If she had felt the change in the air, the way the house had settled into something different. Or if she had been absorbed into it already, part of the emptiness.

""We have to go,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Now.""
She frowned. ""What?""

I couldn’t explain. I couldn’t make her understand. I just needed her to leave.

""I’m serious. I—"" I swallowed. ""I think we should break up.""

She blinked. ""Wait, what?""

""I need you to go. Now.""

Her expression twisted, hurt flashing across her face before hardening into something unreadable. I didn’t care. I just needed her to leave.

She grabbed her things without another word, shaking her head as she stormed toward the door.

I followed, watching, waiting—

The second she stepped through the threshold, Ace ran past me, bolting back inside.

I barely had time to register what was happening before she crossed the doorway.

And then—

The house exhaled.

Not a sound, not a movement, but something deeper, something felt in the marrow. Like the walls had been waiting for this exact moment. Like it had all been leading to this.

The air collapsed in on itself, folding, twisting, turning inside out. The space between seconds stretched and thinned, the room warping like light through heat. The doorway was no longer just a doorway. It was a threshold in the truest sense—a dividing line between what was real and what wasn’t.

My breath hitched. Something peeled away.
The walls bent. The floor trembled. Or maybe I did.
Ace was already inside, disappearing into the darkness as if he had never left at all. My girlfriend—she was still stepping through, her foot frozen midair like time had stuttered, like reality wasn’t sure how to let her leave.

And then it did.

She was gone.

And everything else went with her.

Chapter Eight: The Void

There was nothing.
No air, no walls, no ground beneath my feet. Just an absence so absolute that my body no longer felt like a body. I was here, but I wasn’t.

I tried to move, but there was nowhere to move to.
I tried to breathe, but there was nothing to breathe in.
There was only Ace.

He sat beside me—or maybe he didn’t. Maybe he was part of me now, or I was part of him. It didn’t matter. He was here. We were here.

I don’t know how long we stayed like that. A second? A thousand years? Time didn’t exist anymore, but we existed within it.

I held onto my name at first. My shape. My thoughts. But they were slipping, unraveling thread by thread, breaking down into something smaller, something quieter. Like I was dissolving into the nothing around me.

And Ace—he didn’t fight it.

Because he never had to.

He had always known. He had always accepted.
I think I laughed then, or maybe I cried. Or maybe I did neither. Maybe I just let go.

Ace shifted—or maybe I did. There was no difference anymore.

We weren’t separate. We weren’t anything.
We had always been here.

And somewhere, in the unraveling threads of my fading thoughts, I remembered thinking once—long ago, or maybe just a second ago—that the chimney wasn’t just a chimney.

Maybe you have too.

I am 39F, started my GERD journey when I was about 32, work got quite stressful and I started having very bad heartburn

Long story short: 7 years later, at this moment I have been on Dexlansoprazole 60 MG once a day( as soon as I wake up in morning) for 37 days, a little over 5 weeks. I rarely get heartburn(only if I eat trigger food) but I have this annoying feeling of something stuck in my chest after about 30-45 minutes of eating. I don't have issues swallowing food or liquids, but after meal is over in about 30 minutes the feeling starts, some pressure on chest as well. It's very annoying, intensity would be about 3or4 out of 10, but that is a persistent thing for me.

Almost all food does that to me, trigger and non trigger. Yes, intensity may vary based on foods but I still get that pressure every single day. 

Diet: I avoid all trigger foods, No processed foods/oils, no spicy stuff and no raw tomatoes/onions/garlic (Cooked ones in moderate quantity seems to not trigger acid for me), no coffee, I drink very mild tea with ginger in morning(there have been days when I didn't drink tea but still got the pressure and annoying feeling in chest)

I hope you’ll understand the parts of me I can’t put into words, the tangled mess of thoughts I keep tucked behind half-hearted smiles. Some days, the weight feels heavier than it should, like the world has pressed its thumb against my chest just to see if I’d break. But maybe you’ll be the gentle pause in all that noise, the warmth in the cold spaces I carry.

I don’t expect you to fix me. I just hope, when we find each other, we’ll sit with our shadows together, not needing to chase them away, just letting them be. And maybe, in that quiet understanding, it’ll be enough.

The point is, it's disgusting! I thought I'd be clever and add it to coffee or tea. Nope! It's completely hydrophobic and forms a half-sphere that gets stuck at the bottom. I tried blending it, but it just sticks to the blades and sides of the bullet cup. I appreciate any and all attempts to help. But I'd like to make the assignment crystal clear.

I'm not looking to add a couple of drops of lecithin to a recipe that yields cups and cups of mayonnaise, and then I only use a couple of spoons of the resulting mayonnaise in a day. I want and need to eat entire tablespoons of the stuff, so the resulting recipe (the entire recipe) shouldn't exceed, say, 700 calories. Thank you in advance!",6,1738696214.0,vegan,3,1.0,False

I’m struggling a lot with how to get the alone time I need while still giving my partner what he needs. Unlike me, my partner needs almost no alone time and would happily spend all day every day together. Lately he’s spending 4-6 nights a week at my place, including all weekend. I’ve tried to express my need for space, but I’m not sure he fully understands what that means. For example, I’ll ask for some space to decompress Friday - Saturday and he will show up Saturday morning at 9 am with coffee. He’s so sweet and I know part of this is his own abandonment issues from his parents.

If I put 18g in, after about 25s I have around 55g out. This does taste good to me so that's fine, but trying to get it around the 36g in about the same time seems impossible (I'm confident my tamping is consistent).

I have tried with two beans within their good period, ""Revelation"" from UnionRoasted and ""Chocolate Fudge Brownie"" from CoffeeWorks.

I have tried going finer, but honestly in doing so the coffee starts to taste bitter. Also the gauge on my Barista Express shows around 12-1 ish, which is meant to be about right. I know the gauge isn't the most accurate, and viewed pointless by many I guess. Mine is an older machine and not limited to 9 bar as far as I know.

So I'm wondering if my understanding of everything is off. As I say, it tastes pretty darn good to me, I'd just like to see if I can get close to the numbers out of interest (even if I don't stick to them).

I thought hey awesome, how fresh! So I go home and work on dialing the grind in. No matter what I tried - grind finer, pull longer shots, dose higher, dose lower, all I got was a tart mess. Bleah. The beans are like a lighter medium. So instead of tossing the bag, I just kinda shelved them and thought perhaps they’d be ok with a French press.

Recently I went to that coffee shop/roaster to see what other roasts they had, and I started speaking with one of the owners. He asked me when the beans were roasted. I told him a week prior to me buying them. He told me they’re “too fresh”, and that’s why I was getting so much tartness, especially since they’re a lighter roast. He said let them sit for a couple-few more weeks, and try them again. And that some of those oils would get re-absorbed and the the taste would mature.

It’s now about a 3 weeks since roast. I pulled a double/lungo today, and it was sooo good. Much of the tartness has gone away, and I could actually taste the bean.

Than I went and sat on the couch, he than came and sat on the couch. I was on my phone playing my phone games… he then says to me “obviously you didn’t want it that bad if you’re going to sit on your phone. I’m going to go think about other girls and jerk off. Sorry for what I’m about to do” 

So I started crying. His phone was underneath me, I had no idea. He said “move so I can find my phone” and I was being petty and checked under me to see if it was there, and said I’m not getting up. So he grabbed me, lifted me up, and THREW me on the floor. I hit my head on the corner of the coffee table, and the side of my knees are swollen and scratched, and my back is in so much pain… 

He then moved the coffee table and said to me “apologize to me. Apologize for scratching my finger.” I just sat there and cried, and said sorry for whatever I did. And then he got up and said “maybe if you weren’t such a bitch I wouldn’t have to do that to you” 

I never would have thought he’d ever physically hurt me, but here I am. Heartbroken. I feel sick to my stomach, I’m in pain debating going to see a doctor, my head is bleeding…

Really enjoyed this article.  I first got seriously interested in cocktails during the height of bars like Milk & Honey, Death & Co, etc.  As a home enthusiast, I keep classic and modern classic cocktails in regular rotation.  As the industry has evolved, I've tried to level up by experimenting with acid adjusting, clarification, infusion techniques, fat washing, unique syrups, etc.

As published recipes have gotten more complex, I've often struggled with whether or not the juice was worth the squeeze (pun intended!) to commit to a lengthy process for a cocktail I've never tried.  For example, coffee infused Campari sounds great for that jungle bird riff, and could be great in other cocktails, but what if it's not?  Is that obscure bottle of vino amaro that isn't shelf stable, worth it for that recipe I found, or will I hate it?  I'm running about a 50/50 ratio on these types of experiments.

Additionally, I've gained a great appreciation for bars that are experts in culinary style cocktails.  In Arizona, Century Grand picked up some significant awards recently and their cocktails/ambience/service are outstanding.  The cocktails are expensive and labor intensive to recreate at home, but that's the point!  It isn't meant to be an experience I can replicate and I think it's fantastic.

But other times, menus just seem to exhaust me.  Another unnamed bar has a sazerac riff with: Overproof Rye Whiskey, Branca Menta, Camel Hump Fat, Moraccan Mint Tea, Lemon Peel, Arrack Spritz, and Baklava.  Could be great, but it just seems like they are trying too hard.  Another bar that just opened has a paper plane riff with amaro montenegro, rye whiskey, lime juice, and aperol.  Is this actually an improvement on Sam Ross' spec, or are they just trying to be different?

I heard someone on a podcast argue that modern classic cocktails are sort of dead, but that techniques have become the new ""modern classic"".  I think Wondrich argues a similar sentiment at the end of the article.  Fat washing is here to stay, but maybe, just maybe, coconut oil is preferable to camel hump fat.

Anyways, no real point here, other than it'll be interesting to see if the culinary cocktail movement slows down and we go back to simpler cocktails with improved techniques.",7,1738694588.0,cocktails,7,0.82,False

Kid Two (also teenager) is always ""just in time"" for everything. In fact they have made an exact science of it. One and Two normally get along real well...

One and Two were out sitting in the car with the heated seats set to hot. I walk out of the house and look at the car and all the windows are snow covered. I open the drivers door look in to see them with their heads down and ""buried"" in their phones. I state ""you couldn't clear the snow from the car?"" I tuned the gas lighting out as I closed the drivers door, stood outside for a second to take a breath of the cold crisp air, and then opened the back door to search for the snow brush and scraper.

I wonder which one will be better this AM i thought to myself. The scraper was my choice. I cleared the side windows best I could. But that small scrapper just wasn't cutting it. Reached in, grabbed the long brush and heard, as I was closing the door, ""we're going to be la..."". I decided the long brush was the right choice after redoing the side windows. I meticulously cleaned the front window, lifted the wipers and made sure to get every bit of snow out from underneath. Did the same for the back window. Cleaned the headlight, the two rear lights, and then the other headlight. Cleared the licence plate off. Cleared the hood next. I looked at the roof and decided to clear that too. Just my luck I pushed the snow that was on the roof down onto the front window. Being safe is no chump job... I, again, cleaned the front window to the point that there was not a snowflake left on it. As I walked to the back door I noticed a build up of ice on the door handles. I did a good job cleaning all four of them as well.

The normal twelve minute drive took us sixteen because the roads were a bit slushy, I went a little below the speed limited; after all, I was transporting special cargo. The only noise I heard were the sighs from Kid Two. We made it to school, they jumped out, I told them I loved them and to have a great day. Got a return ""i love you too"" from both and as Kid Two's door was closing I heard them say to Kid One: ""NEXT TIME CLEAN THE FUCKING WINDOWS WHEN YOU GO OUT TO START THE CAR!""

1ihosso,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ihosso/this_year_has_started_out_unkind/,This year has started out unkind,"From the start of last summer until the end of December I was living my best life. I don’t think there was a single point where I wasn’t in a good mood with a smile on my face despite whatever hardships I faced. I was constantly busy, but I enjoyed being constantly busy then. I was taking classes in both the summer and fall. I was involved on campus, constantly working on myself, spending time with friends, family, and on my hobbies. I traveled, met so many new people, and developed so many skills. I was enjoying the work I was putting in, but still had time to relax when I needed it. I felt productive and fulfilled, life couldn’t get better.

Now this year has started and I’ve moved into an apartment with a close friend who has the opposite schedule of me so I’m almost always alone there. I started an internship and am not taking classes this semester so I’m not on campus and don’t see my friends very often. I try to make plans but it’s difficult to since everyone is busy. I didn’t make as much money in January as I hoped and had to redo my entire budget and limit my spending. There’s been a huge change in my environment, which always gives me anxiety. I had so many plans, goals, and aspirations for January and one by one each plan fell through. 

The real kicker is there’s this woman whom I met last fall and became decent friends with- she has a great personality, is virtuous, fun and easy to be around, we always had interesting conversations and good chemistry together, I could go on. I had no intention of being in a relationship anytime soon for personal reasons, but I couldn’t help but crushing on her. Hell, we had plans to get coffee together but even those fell through! Just over a week ago though I drunkenly texted her a mess of emotions saying I think I had feelings for her but I really enjoyed being friends, etc. which is something I’ve never done. Lo and behold we aren’t talking anymore- it’s going to be really awkward when we have classes together this summer. I wish I could go back and undo that or at least that she’d give me the chance to apologize.

Now I’m constantly busy and not enjoying anything. I feel very overwhelmed and anxious. It’s been eating away at me and I’m letting it get the best of me. I don’t even think things have been that bad for me especially when I see everything going on in the world and to others. I have life easy and am thankful for everything I have. I’m usually confident, outgoing, and have a love for everyone and everything, but I’ve lost that love for now. All l do is work, eat, and sleep. Walking/hiking is one of the only things I can do without feeling extremely anxious. My usual hobbies just aren’t doing it for me if I even have the time to do them. I just don’t get how I managed last year.

The last couple days I’ve been trying to get back in the swing of things but I keep bouncing back and forth. I want a chance to restart this year or go back to last summer and not make the same mistakes / enjoy those times again but I know I can’t. I do know how to get better. I do know things will get better, but I’m stuck and don’t have the motivation. I’d really like a break, but I won’t get that.",1,1738694130.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

The old man is as stuborn as they get and for the longest time I thought he would never die. Sad how fast things change. His mind has been slipping. Where he used to be sharp as a tac he now struggles to remember what he just said. My family have been taking turns staying with him in his big old house. It doesn't feel right to ship him off to a nursing home just yet. 

I'm on summer break from college so I was more than willing to jump into the rotation and watch him. It was on my first night here, when I was cleaning up after dinner, when something caught my eye. There was a pile of mail sitting on the kitchen counter. While it wasn't too odd it was the stack of opened envelopes held together with twine that really drew me. Curiosity got the better of me and I started looking through them. Each evelope contained several pages from what looked like a journal. 

However, the weirdest part is who they were from. Each one addressed my Grandfather as Dad and ended with your son, Jedidiah. The only thing is my Grandfather only had daughters. So who is this Uncle of mine? I don't know if I want to know either, not after reading the contents of the jouranl entry of the first envelope. I'll attach it here and hope that maybe one of you understand this.

:

It would be a lie to say I grew up wanting to be a priest. My father would take my sisters and me to church every Sunday, whether it was snowing or blisteringly hot, we always went. While my sisters were off finding their husbands, I was growing in the faith and spent more time praying than socializing. However, I was still hesitant when my father told me I should attend a seminary school after graduation. It was not exactly the most thrilling prospect as a seventeen-year-old kid, but after some thought that summer, I decided to give it a shot. It would be the best and worst decision of my life.

Once I was fully ordained, I was dispatched to a corner of the globe that had drifted away from the church. Where I ended up was a town on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland called Blythe. It was a small, isolated fishing town whose main claim to fame was the rumored existence of a nearby Viking landing site. I knew it was my calling when I learned that it had previously been host to a catholic church. However, after it burned down in the early 1800s with the priest inside, there was never any attempt to rebuild it.

On my first visit to Blythe, I found the remains of the old church buried deep in the woods outside of town. There was barely anything left besides the cellar and some large logs still blackened by flames. It would be easy to clear the rubble and build my new church atop where the old one once stood. Luckily I was given sufficient funds by the Vatican for this undertaking. 

The locals were leery of me initially since not many outsiders came through their neck of the woods. On this first visit, I tried my best to introduce myself to as many people as possible, but sadly, my trip ended before I could make any real progress. I did, however, pay a group of workers to begin constructing the new church before I left. 

On my second trip, the locals were more receptive to my presence. Several people approached me, asking about the church, faith, and me personally. Frankly, I wasn’t expecting this kind of reception after my last visit, but there was one encounter that stood out. 

I was visiting the construction site. The sun was getting low and the workers were packing up for the day. Most of the framing had been done and I took great pleasure walking through the hollow interior imagining what it would look like finished. That was when one of the workers approached me.

“Excuse me, Father?” He asked, taking off his hard hat.

“Yes?”

I would come to find out his name was Johnathan Heathstead. He stood there and scratched his head like he wasn’t sure what to say next.

“Do you…Do you believe in demons?” He asked.

“Yes, I sure do.”

“But do you believe in them?”

“I…I don’t know what you’re asking,” I said.

Johnathan paused for a long second before speaking.

“Never mind.”

At the time, I didn’t think too much about this interaction. Looking back I should have. 

With my third visit, I brought two suitcases and my cat Spots. I was finally moving to Blythe. The church was finished, at least as finished as a church in the backcountry could be. I was proud of it. In fact, I was so excited that I opened the doors to all visitors that first day. I was already greeting nearly two dozen people before I even had a chance to unpack. While that might not seem like many, every pew was filled in that small church.

There was one man, however, who wasn’t sitting. He was standing in the back watching me as I gave my little sermon and invited the crowd to attend that Sunday’s mass. After everyone filed out, he approached me.

It was Johnathan. I could hardly recognize him. He looked tired, with dark bags under his eyes and a long, disheveled beard. His clothes looked two sizes too big and it took me a moment to recognize they were the same clothes he was wearing the day I had met him. 

“Father,” He croaked, his voice harsh and dry, “Do you have a moment?”

I paused, unsure how to react.

“I need help,” he said with tears welling in his eyes.

While I was ready to listen to him talk about losing a loved one or going through a nasty divorce, I wasn’t ready for what he ended up saying. I ushered him to the first row of pews and we sat for a few minutes before he started talking.

“Father…Do you believe in the Devil?” He asked.

“Yes of course.”

“Do you believe he walks among us?”

“Sadly I do. He exists in the hearts of men everywhere.”

Johnathan paused, more tears spilling down his cheeks. I became acutely aware of the smell of fresh lumber at that moment. Strange what you notice in the silence between words.

“I believe the Devil has his grip on me,” he whispered.

“What makes you think that, my child?”

Johnathan took a long, steadying breath before he spoke again.

“I don’t know why, but I’ve started to…do things.”

“What things?” I pressed.

“I…I black out sometimes. Sometimes only for a few minutes, but other times for whole days. When I wake up…When I wake I…Sometimes I come to and I’m waist-deep in the ocean on the brink of the abyss. Others…others I am bare-chested and covered in b-blood. Normally I am outside, on a rock, or up a tree. But, sometimes I am in the basement of my house scribbling like a madman with chalk and blood.”

“Whose blood is it?”

“I-I-I don’t know. Sometimes I swear it is fish blood, others I am not too sure. Our dog went missing a few weeks ago…I don’t know.”

Johnathan broke down. Sobbing into his hands. I noticed they were slightly stained red. 

“Father, I need help. Please!”

Now, the Church has had controversy with mental illnesses being conflated with possession, so to say I wasn’t exactly reaching for my cross and Bible over what this man was telling me would be an understatement. 

“Let me consult with my superiors,” I said, patting him on the back, “they will surely know what the best course of action is.”

“Father, I need help now!”

“Yes I know, but I am limited in what I can do right now.”

Johnathan’s face immediately sobered up and a flash of rage shined in his eyes. Tears still rolled down his cheeks as he stood up and stormed out of the church. 

“Go in peace!” I called out after him, “God protects all of his children and gives us strength!”

Johnathan paused halfway through the door and turned back to me.

“Then I am no child of God,” He said before slamming the door shut.

I sat in the empty church for a while, considering what had just happened. My welcome to the town had gone smoothly so far but I was afraid, after how that confession went, that I might not be up to the task. Spots jumped up on my lap and started purring. It put me at ease and the rest of the evening went smoothly.

I had no way of knowing that that night, Johnathan would enter his basement and never emerge again. 

It was a closed-casket funeral. A small, intimate affair even though I am sure half the town showed up. It was there that I met Marie, Johnathan’s widow. A few days after the funeral, I decided to stop by the new widow’s home. I didn’t feel it was appropriate to crowd around her at the funeral or to simply ignore her. My motivation wasn’t entirely altruistic, a selfish part of me wished to wash my hands of the guilt that had weighed on me since I got the news. 

When Marie answered the door, it was obvious she’d been crying. Her eyes were red and puffy and her nose was almost rubbed raw.

“Good evening Father, what can I do for you?” She asked.

“I just wanted to stop by and offer my condolences,” I said.

She opened her mouth and closed it several times.
“Would you like to come in?” She said, biting back tears, “I would appreciate some guidance.”

Marie led me inside to a small, two-person dining table in the kitchen. 

“Coffee?” She asked.

“That would be great.”

Her hands were shaking as she grabbed two mugs from the cupboard. 

“Father,” she started, “do you believe in demons?”

Now, I like to believe I am a rational man, but I would be lying if I said that question didn’t immediately make me feel sick to my stomach.

“Yes, of course.”

“Can they make a sane man do what Johnny did?” She asked, placing the mug of old coffee in front of me before sinking into the opposite chair.

“What did Johnathan do?”

“I-I don’t know. He told me he was having nightmares but I didn’t think they were all that serious. I mean who would? What was I supposed to do?”

“My child,” I placed my hand on her wrist, “what did Johnathan do?”

Marie wiped at her nose and looked at the basement door.

“He came home late and he was sweating like crazy. I got him water and he seemed to settle down. We went to bed and…and…” she broke down but quickly composed herself, “I found him down there that morning. The sheriff took his body and some photos but it was clear it was self-inflicted. The door was locked from the inside. He told me I get to be the one to clean it up but I haven’t opened that door since that morning.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Why, Father, why did this happen?”

“I don’t know.”

“What should I do?”

“I…I don’t know,” I sheepishly said.

Marie stood up and walked over to the window.

“You haven’t touched the basement?” I asked.

“No. No, not yet.”

“Let me help, it’s the least I can do.”

Marie led me to the basement door. She didn’t open it, only nodding towards the doorknob before shuffling back to the dining table. 

The door whined as it swung open revealing nothing but a curtain of darkness just past the threshold. A distinct metal tinge hung in the air and stuck on my tongue. I rolled up my sleeves and whispered a quick prayer. Each step creaked as I descended into the darkness. I didn’t know what to expect but it wasn’t what was down there. 

I pulled on the light cord. It was an unfinished basement with low beam ceilings and concrete floors, a desk was pushed to the side with a rug rolled up and stored on top. It made a clearing in the middle of the basement. 

It was red—red everywhere—streaks and drops, smears across the floors and on the walls. A tinge of rusting iron hung in the air. Among the streaks, there were broken fingernails and scraps of skin. It made me feel weak.

At first, there was no pattern to the madness. Just intersecting lines and circles, hard angles, and jagged scribbling. My head was spinning and I stumbled back to the stairs. I sat for a while, staring at the self-inflicted carnage when it finally started to form.

It was a single, massive rune, or at least something like a rune. It was surprisingly intricate, with large smears making up the border with smaller drops and streaks for finer details. I took several pictures of the rune from every possible angle. I didn’t know what I would do but I still felt I should document it. It took a few hours to clean up the blood. Even after cleaning, the floor was still stained red. 

“God be with you,” I said standing on the house's front step, “it always gets better with time.”

Marie didn’t say anything as she slowly closed the door. 

Several months passed and I had settled into a routine. The buzz around the new church had died down and there was regular attendance during mass. While it wasn’t the most exciting place to be, Blythe and the surrounding countryside had started to grow on me. With the coming of fall and the changing of leaves, I found myself outside more and more. 

The forests behind the church could have well been endless. The locals had carved hiking paths through the trees and several fallen logs made excellent benches. I hadn’t seen or heard anything about Marie since I visited her house that night. Rumor was that she had secluded herself and was living as a hermit, barely leaving her house. Who could blame her?

Since that night, I haven’t looked at the photos I took. There was no need to; they were seared into my memory. I thought about that night regularly on my walks through the woods. There was one tree that was my turning point for my walks. Rumor has it that it was a lone survivor of the region's old-growth forest. I say this as a man of God; I understand why ancient peoples believed these great things to be gods themselves.

It was after one of these hikes that I found a note folded up and slid under the door. It was written in handwriting so heavy it pierced the page a few times. It simply read: 

Help.

While it was a bit of a stretch, I presumed the note was from Marie. After all, who else would it have been from? She just needed help after Johnathan passed away. Oh how wrong I was. It was getting late but I made the trek out to her house that night. The house sat on the outskirts of town overlooking the ocean. 

Once I reached the front door, the sun had already set and the insects had started singing their tunes. I was about to knock when I realized the door was already open.

“Mrs. Heathstead?” I called out.

Nothing but the darkness of the house answered. The door let out a low creak as I pushed it open.

“Mrs. Heathstead? Are you here?”

No response.

I stepped inside, the floorboards moaning under my feet. 

“Mrs Heathstead are you there?” 

I was about to turn back when I heard a faint sobbing coming from the basement. The basement door was slightly ajar, inky darkness on the other side. I took a step closer. The sobbing suddenly stopped. 

I heard whispering coming from the basement.

“What did you say? Mrs. Heathstead?”

The voice that responded was raspy and almost indiscernibly quiet.

“There’s a man at the top of the stairs.”

I took a step closer, my heart pumping in my ears as the voice spoke again.

“And another in the basement.”

Screaming echoed from the basement. The inky darkness was dispelled as orange flames burst from the basement. I fell back, barely avoiding a burst of flames that licked at the place I was just standing. Scrambling to my feet, I barely got out of the doorway before the door slammed shut. By what force I don’t know.

It was only for the briefest of moments, but for a second I thought something was staring at me from the window. As I blinked the windows exploded in flames sending shards of glass flying in every direction.

The Heathstead house burned down in less than 5 minutes. It took nearly double that for the first men carrying hoses to respond. I stared at the flames, my clothes and hair singed.  The flames swirled and licked the night sky.

The Sheriff seemed just as confused and disturbed as I was when I gave my statement. Whether this was because he believed me or didn’t, I don’t know. I was still an outsider after all. A couple died so soon after I arrived. Even the most trusting man would be suspicious.

It was eventually ruled as self-inflicted. It is easier to believe that a grief-stricken widow would choose to end her pain than for it to be the work of the devil.

I don’t know what I saw in that window. If I saw anything in that window. I like to believe I am a reasonable man as much as I am a holy one. But after that night, I find myself struggling for answers.
All I know is the devil is real, and I fear he is here in Newfoundland.

We use only hand tools for now, though some of the more advanced kids are ready for power tools and I'm slowly introducing them when we have time.

So far the projects have been a compass (to learn measuring and marking) introducing the brace (hand drill), speed square (his name Jeff and we don't want Jeff to fall off the cliff - basically giving them and easy way to remember how the square works to make a 90 degree line), backsaw and miter box, tape measure.

A medieval buckler shield, using the compass to draw the circle on their assembled 14"" x 14"" shields and introducing the coping saw for the curved edge, hammer and nails for assembly along with wood glue and its properties, and f-style clamps.

Standard tool box with dowel handle, introducing the concept of cross cut vs rip cut, forstner bit in the brace for the dowel hole, and finding angles with the speed square. For the more advanced ones they learned how to use 1/4"" dowels to reinforce the butt joints in the box.

Bird house, using all the concepts learned so far in different ways like cutting the forstner drilled hole wider with the coping saw (threading the blade for an interior cut), using the speed square for a 45 degree angle instead of a 90 (for the roof cuts). And staining with coffee or steel wool.

Some of my students are designing their own simple projects but I need more that are appropriate for all skill levels, and more importantly FUN for all of them. We've got rc car ramps, shelves for their toys, a folding TV tray from one of my top kids, and a few treasure chests.

1ihon82,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrballen/comments/1ihon82/camping_nightmare/,Camping Nightmare,"The Last year of my sister Jennifer’s summer before college, we went camping up at Gilberts creek located in the Uinta Mountains. It was the year 2003 and we packed our tent, sleeping bags and all the essential camping gear. We were driving her old 1989 Toyota Tacoma (Good old Yoshi) since the road we would take to get there was an old ATV trail.  The Toyota was so small that it could barely fit in between the tree lines on each side of the road. The trail to get to the camping spot was a good 7 miles in from the main dirt road up in the Uinta Mountains. We loved finding places where nobody else could camp by us and we found it. 
         
   We found the perfect place to set camp right next to the river.  Along the river was a large tree that had fallen down across the river so we could go across it to the other side and hike around to see more area. We brought our little chihuahua Myena along with us. She hated people!!!! She was terrified of anyone who came to our home. She barked at all of our friends and family members who came to visit. She was annoying. We were so excited to go camping but we had no idea the danger we were putting ourselves in………
             
The 1st night, we stayed up and told each other stories and joked around by a fire we had going and Jennifer started telling me a story her friend told her on how he had seen Sasquatch. As he was camping with a friend they both setup a tent where the top came off so you could see the stars. They fell asleep and awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of branches breaking. They both looked at each other and stayed very quiet as they listened to something approaching the tent. Their hearts were pounding as something massive came directly to the tent and this thing was so tall; it towered over the top of the tent!!!! They seen this huge black figure started to bend down and make direct eye contact with them!!!!! As they closed their eyes in sheer terror, it slowly stood straight up and slowly walked away back into the forest. 
   
So after her friends story, me and my sister put out the fire and went to the tent. We laid down and opened the sides of the tent so we could see outside. There was netting on each side of the tent once unzipping the plastic layer. After hearing that story I didn’t want to chance not being able to see something if we too heard something in the middle of the night.
 
Around 2:00 in the morning there was something slowly waking me from sleep. Way off in the distance I could hear, boom boom boom boom, Boom Boom Boom Boom, BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!!! I woke right up and looked directly at Jenny!!!! She was already awake looking straight up listening intently to the sound. It was Drums!!!!!! We were hearing drums!!!! Like the kind you hear before a large battle is about to take place!!!!! We both listened intently until finally it faded away and then silence. I looked at her and said “What the hell was that!!!!” She said, “supposedly this used to be an old Indian battleground. Maybe we just heard the drums they used to play before they all were massacred!!””Jenny!!!!!!! You brought us to camp in an old Indian battle/burial ground!!!!” I said. I was scared to death. Needless to say I didn’t sleep well the rest of the night. 
   
We woke up the next morning and started to make breakfast. It was so serene listening to the sound of the river right next to us and we heated up eggs and chicken (Momma and baby together again 🤗🤗😉). I was slicing up some fresh tomatoes and started sipping my coffee (we used to drink NesCafe in hot chocolate since we were not allowed to have coffee at home. We would disguise it as hot chocolate! So Clever) and Myena was next to us hoping for human breakfast as well when some old dude out of the wood works all decked out in camo came right up and walked in between me and my sister’s chairs!!!! He had a long grey beard and shaggy hair underneath a camo baseball cap. He had no facial expression whatsoever and piercing grey eyes. At 1st glance I was thinking why in the heck is this old dude (mid 40’s. That’s old to teenagers) decked out in camo in the middle of summer!!!! And then I noticed on his belt was a massive machete buckled in on the side. 
 
  Jenny was startled and said, “Oh!!!!!!! Good morning!!!! And smiled a beautiful dashing grin at him. He was dead silent and just kept walking!!!! Not a word!!! No expression!!! Nothing!!!! He just kept walking!!!! Like he never even seen us!!!! The weirdest part about the whole thing was Myena didn’t bark once!!!!! I thought for sure she would have been freaking out screaming!!!! But not even a yip!!!! We slowly watched him until he disappeared from view in the trees.
“That was so weird!!!!! I said to my sister. “I know!!!! He didn’t even say anything when we talked to him!!!! He walked right in between us and said nothing!!!!”  Jenny said. “And where did he come from??? We haven’t heard a single 4-wheeler, ATV since we have been here!!!!” “We are back here more than 7 miles!!!” She added. 
 
This was one of the weirdest encounters either one of us had ever had. We started joking about the incident after we brought up how Myena didn’t bark so it meant the old man (mid 40’s) had to have been a ghost . It was the only logical theory really. 
  
We got breakfast cleared away and decided to go for an adventure to see more of the area. We walked carefully across the log that had fallen by the river and went exploring. Everything was green and lush and all of the wildflowers were in bloom.

 We were pretty careless on where we were walking since we knew all we had to do was walk back towards the sound of the rushing river to find our way back towards camp. We hiked for a ways. Myena was not the best at keeping up. She cried and whimpered tagging along behind us. She got pretty far back and just started crying like she couldn’t see us so Jenny started calling for her. She finally caught sight of us and started running at us like she had been lost in the forest for days!!!! She ran fast like a little rabbit!!! She leapt high into the air and all of the sudden she was gone! She fell right into a hole. It was a little squirrel hole and she was screaming. 

We went and grabbed her out of the hole and  she was fine. Poor little thing was just terrified of being outdoors. She was not happy about it at all. She was definitely not cut out for it. 
      
It also was not a highlight of our hiking excursion having a straggler along so we decided to go back to camp and let her rest. By the time we got back to camp it was a little past 1:00. So we started to reheat up what was left over from breakfast and just have that for lunch. Me and Jenny talked and gabbed, gabbed and talked and just was taking in the scenery around us.

I noticed movement on a mountain side and peered closely hoping to see a deer or an elk sneaking through the tree line. As I kept my gaze however I noticed that it was blending. It was blending in well and then it dawned on me what I was seeing. It was that guy again!!!! He was walking very slowly through the tree line about 20 ft out from our camp along a mountain side staying in line with the tree cover. 

I turned to Jenny and said in a loud whisper “ Jenny!!!! That guy is up there walking around!!! “ Jenny squinted and peered then her eyes went wide. “Oh my heck!!!!!” She said. “What is he doing!!!!” I whispered. “Well, Jenny started, maybe he works for the forest service or something and he is making trails out here.” “Or… I pitched in, maybe he is lost and was hungry and came to our camp to eat food but we came back before he could fix himself a SAMICH!!!!!!! Hahahahahaha!!!!” We both started giggling and kept on gabbing and talking, talking and gabbing like the silly dumb teenagers we were. 
     
We stayed by the campfire for pretty much the remaining of the day and when evening hit, Jenny wanted to go exploring again. I told her that Myena was just going to cry and whine the whole time 
and that it would be just like before. She agreed and we decided to put her in the truck. 

So we put her in the truck and started walking to the old stump lying across the river. Myena started screaming and crying with her head barely high enough that we could see it through the driver side window. “We can’t leave her in there” Jenny said and walked back to let her out. Myena had peed all over the driver’s side seat!!! “Oh my gosh!!!! MYENA!!! Jenny yelled. I started busting up laughing as she got a towel and wiped up as much pee as she could off the seat with a disgust look on her face. Priceless. 
  
Once she finished I said, “ok let’s go!” “Wait!!! Yelled Jenny. “What? “ I said. “What are we going to do with Myena, Jessy?” I thought about it. “Just put her in the tent.” “What! Jenny cried, Are you crazy? She just peed all over the truck! She will pee all over our sleeping bags if I put her in there!!!!” I started laughing again. “Well then just leave her by camp, I said she won’t try and cross the stump she is too much of a pansy.”
    
So we left Myena by the camping chairs and told her stay. We were half way across the stump when I heard Jenny scream! “MYENA!!!!!” Here comes Myena scurrying across the stump, walk walk walk walk plop! Right into the river!!!! “MYYYYENNAAAAA!!!!!” Jenny is frantic!
    
I was the 1st one on the stump so I immediately ran the rest of the way across and started running the river bank to catch up to her floating down the river. I finally caught up to her and jumped in and grabbed my sister’s little drenched rat. She was shaking and shivering as I got her back to camp and I handed her to Jenny to wrap in a towel. (It wasn’t the same towel used to wipe up the seat). 
  
I was soaked from head to toe and went straight to the tent to put dry clothes on.  
That water was ice cold!!!!!! I could hear Jenny talking to Myena trying to calm her down and cuddling her I’m sure. I started getting dry clothes on. The tent plastic siding was still down and I peered out across the river and there in some willow bushes was the old man staring with his piercing eyes directly towards the tent!!!!! 

My heart started pounding!!!!! BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!! I scrambled to get  completely dressed and peered out just barely enough to glance again and I couldn’t see him anymore. What the literal EFF!!!!!!! I was scared. I felt dread and fear like I have never before. I kept searching the area where the willow bushes were, And nothing! Gone.

 I had no idea where he went. I hurried and got out of the tent and tried to calmly go sit by my sister scoping the entire area. As I scanned I slowly told Jenny, “ So when I was just changing……
I stopped for a moment still searching for him. “Yeah???” Jenny said. “Jenny, I whispered, when I was just changing in the tent. I looked over across the river and I seen that old man sitting in some bushes looking over to the tent. I hurried and got completely dressed, And when I looked back…….. He wasn’t there anymore.” I was still searching everywhere scared to my core.

Jenny’s eyes went wide in total terror!!!! 
“We have to leave right now!!!!!” Jenny immediately jumped up and started heading for the truck. She put Myena inside and went straight for the tent. I slammed the camping chairs shut and threw them in the back of the truck along with the cooler then headed over to help Jenny. She literally took the sticks apart that held the tent together and it collapsed with all of our clothes and pillows and sleeping bags inside of it still. 

We were still searching all around our camp. The tent was so heavy we literally dragged it to the side of the truck and used all of our strength to slide it up into the bed of the truck. We have never packed up camp so quickly in our lives. 
    
We both hopped in and locked the doors still searching thinking at any second the man would come running out with his machete in his hand!!!! Jenny drove out like a bat out of hell until we were pretty far from the area we stayed at. She finally broke the silence. 
    
“You know that if you didn’t see him across the river, that we still would have been there right now. And we would have fallen asleep tonight and we would have been killed. He would have came into our camp and slaughtered us.” 
  
She was right. We would have been killed. Whoever that man was he was watching us the entire day and was waiting for it to get dark. There is no mistaking your instincts. When they kick in and scream at you that you’re about to die. You listen to it!!!!! My heart still beats fast at the memory of looking across the river at the old man’s piercing eyes.

But now I am at the end of my rope. I need another work from home job which is impossible to find, but this is just not cutting it. I can’t stand being tethered to my computer for seven hours hours of the day (I’m not courting the breaks/lunch). I deal with depression and anxiety as it is and what makes me feel better is walking outside, being in the sun. I would love to be able to work at a coffee shop or take a little walk, breaks here and there. Even for people who don’t deal with that it’s difficult . I had a friend watch me work for a few minutes and she said she would go crazy if she had to do this. She works in the office, but she said she’s even allowed to walk around and doesn’t have time breaks.  She couldn’t fathom the concept that I had to sit around and wait for a call tether to my computer even if I’m not getting a call. 

But you know how our jobs are all the breaks and lunches are timed. I feel like it’s mini Amazon out here. Whether you work at home or in the office. People should be treated more humanely rather than as robots.

And the back to back to back to back calls . OMG. I can’t it anymore! I feel like I’m getting to the end of my rope. 

Luckily, I haven’t really been called out for taking advantage of my brakes  but then whenever I think that I hear it in a meeting with my supervisor.

I recently had an appointment for this and my doctor says I have overall muscle weakness and she doesn't want to diagnose it as fibromyalgia as I'm young, but it's the same thing

I wanted to know if there's any tips for managing fibromyalgia with school/work since school is getting really stressful as I have to apply for university next year. my pains make it really hard to focus when I'm at home or I have a free period so I end up not doing enough work and my grades are already going downhill. I'm also not getting enough sleep so my weakness gets 10x worse throughout the day, and my motivation to study just disappears. I'm so stressed currently which makes it even worse and it's difficult since my body feels inflamed all the time and I feel tired so I get no work done. I can't miss a day of school since I'll have so much work to catch up on and I have no time to rest. it's also affecting my social life as on really bad days, I'll be withdrawn and I don't talk much with my friends

for context, I don't take any medicine (not even painkillers unless I really need it since my parents are worried about it affecting my stomach) so I'm kind of going through this with nothing, I don't drink coffee either. I've been referred to a physiotherapist and a psychologist but I haven't had an appointment yet, and I've had physical therapy sessions in the past but my motivation for them is gone so I haven't done any of the exercises for months. the school doesn't know yet, so I don't have any exam help although I think I'll need some (they'll be told after I have my physical therapy appointment) and I have really important mock exams in early may. I really want to study much more, but my pain and fatigue is all I can feel so it's hard. I want someone to validate my pain and tell me that studying is going to be difficult but it just feels like an excuse since I've never liked to study or been a hard worker.

Even in the gym when earlier people waited for my turn to end on a specific machine, i used to suggest them to have alternate sets with me or i would try to complete my sets as fast as possible so as to not cause any inconvenience to other people. Now i just say the other person that i'll be accommodating the equipment for next sets and leave up to them.

Last week visited a cafe alone, which was kind of a big deal for me as i avoid being alone. Ordered a coffee tonic and a cheesecake and sat there alone reading NMMNG and having it.

1ihogaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1ihogaf/how_do_i_stop_myself_from_taking_back_my_former/,How do I stop myself from taking back my former favourite person?,"We’ve been friends for five years. We used to text multiple hours a day, every day. Sometimes it felt like we both worked on the same wavelength. We’d update each other on the most inconsequential things that’d happen to us. She tipped over her coffee mug and was annoyed she had to clean up? I knew about it within a minute. I knocked my shoulder on the doorframe on accident? She knew about it within two minutes. We also see each other every day at school. What I’m trying to say is: she has been a very large, very significant part of my life. 

Having said that, our friendship wasn’t very good. The biggest two reasons were lack of communication and lack of emotional intelligence (on my part) and maturity (on her part). I’m not great at social cues, I tend to deal with social problems by ignoring them, I’m not good at supporting my friends emotionally. She lacks a bit of empathy (doesn’t even pretend to care about my hobbies, can’t understand when I tell her her actions are hurting others/me/our friends), ghosts me for hours-to-weeks on end if I say something she dislikes, and tends to have those random mood switches—like, she’s texting me happily as we’re both coming to school, and then we get to class and all of a sudden she’s dry and cold while being super friendly to everyone else; or we’re talking like normal about some neutral topic and suddenly she snaps at me and gets annoyed. 

There were many times during her ghosting periods that I decided: that was it, this is the end of our friendship, I won’t take her back. I always do. I’m not usually that kind of a person—I’ve never had trouble cutting someone off before. It’s just that living without her is kind of like living without a phone or a watch: sure, you can do it, but it feels like a big part of you is missing at every step. Whenever she approaches me again I just melt and am happy to go back to how things were before. I used to tell myself that if she talked to me, then that was net positive emotions, and if she didn’t, then it was just net zero—so it was fine, even beneficial, to keep this up.

I’m being ghosted right now. I told her I’d have to skip class to get to my doctor’s appointment, she told me that class was cancelled anyway and if had bothered to listen I would have known. I told her I know she’s lying, I can check it on the school’s app. We went back-and-forth on how she’s not lying. Then she admitted that yes, she did lie, but it was funny and I just couldn’t take a stupid joke anymore, and maybe we should just stop talking to each other. It’s been two weeks. It’s not the longest she’s ever ignored me for, but it’s on the longer side anyway. It’s also not the first time she told me “Let’s not talk anymore then” or some other variation of it. 

Having said that, this time is different. I thought she was getting better, growing up; we’ve both hit 19 years old this year and I expected her to change. I think I was just being stupid though; I’ve been thinking about it, and I think she’s just getting less empathetic, more cruel towards others, and more cruel towards me. It’s probably exam season coming up, but I don’t think this friendship is good for either of us. 

For me personally, I’m tired of that sinking feeling whenever she ignores me. I’m tired of feeling awful when we fight. I’m tired of her icing me out when we’re hanging out with mutual friends, of her snapping at me and making me feel bad just because she has a mood swing. I’m tired of always trying to be the bigger person, of never being the one to be cruel and ignore her back, of never giving her the taste of her own medicine, of never stooping down to her level. Though, I don’t want to do what she did to me; I don’t want to play those stupid, childish games of ghosting and icing out. I just want to be done with her. I can’t cut her off completely because we have way too many mutual close friends, but I want to just treat her as a friend-of-my-friend and think nothing of it. 

I’m scared that I’ll take her back when she comes to me, despite being done with her right now. This friendship is not sustainable, we’re not good at being friends for each other. I know that, but I miss her. I miss texting her, I miss talking to her in class, I miss random texts we’d send each other throughout the day, I miss going out together, I miss getting updates about her life. So many times I started sending her a Tiktok I know she’d love and had to stop myself, or began reaching for my phone out of habit before reminding myself I can’t tell her about that funky looking squirrel I can see from my window anymore, or about the way that lady on the bus is holding her purse.",5,1738693312.0,lostafriend,1,1.0,False

Almost 3 years ago I met a girl for whom I developed feelings, we met a few times but it didnt go that well, the convos started to get dry and we eventually lost contact.

In September 2024 her instagram profile popped up on my fyp, so I decided to send her a text just to catch up, for old time's sake. 2 things I need to point out:

1. It turns out that this semester she entered the same uni as me (I'm a 3rd year on a different major), we kept talking here and there and met for coffee a few times.
2. She ended her last relationship last summer and told me that she doesnt want a bf rn.

Moving up to 3 weeks ago, we start talking everyday, she suddenly starts showing a lot of interest and reciprocity (asking how my day went, playing videogames n watching shows together, meeting at least once a week).

1ihocjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuriTheCrypto/comments/1ihocjf/teaching_hangul_ㅋ_with_pronunciation_guide/,"Teaching Hangul ""ㅋ"" – With Pronunciation Guide","# ㅋ (kieuk, kʰ)

**1. Shape Explanation**

""ㅋ"" looks like ""ㄱ"" but with an extra horizontal line, giving it a stronger and more dynamic appearance. Its structure is simple, yet distinctive.  
In pronunciation, ""ㅋ"" is an aspirated sound, meaning it has a noticeable burst of air when spoken. It’s similar to the ""k"" in ""kite,"" but with a slightly stronger emphasis.

**2. Pronunciation Comparison**

* **Beginning of a syllable**: The sound is strong and clear, like the ""k"" in ""key.""
* **Example**: 칼 \[kʰal\] (""knife"").
* **Ending of a syllable**: When used as a final consonant (받침), it’s pronounced as \[k̚\], similar to the ""k"" in ""back.""
* **Example**: 부엌 \[pu.ʌk̚\] (""kitchen"").

**3. Word Examples with Pronunciation**

* 칼 (kal): Pronounced \[kʰal\] (meaning ""knife"") 🔪
* 코 (ko): Pronounced \[kʰo\] (meaning ""nose"") 👃
* 키 (ki): Pronounced \[kʰi\] (meaning ""key"" or ""height"") 🗝️📏

**4. Pronunciation Practice**

""Now, repeat after me!""

* 칼 \[kʰal\]
* 코 \[kʰo\]
* 키 \[kʰi\]
* 부엌 \[pu.ʌk̚\]

**5. Writing Practice**

👉 Draw ""ㅋ"" in the air with your finger while saying ""kieuk""!  
👉 Write ""ㅋ"" on paper and practice connecting it to vowels:

* 카, 키, 쿠, 캐, 코

👉 Then, try writing full words like 칼, 키, or 코.

**6. Extension Practice**

After mastering ""ㅋ,"" practice full words and explore their meanings:

* 카드 (kadeu): \[kʰa.dɯ\] (""card"") 💳
* 커피 (keopi): \[kʰʌ.pi\] (""coffee"") ☕
* 쿠키 (kuki): \[kʰu.ki\] (""cookie"") 🍪",1,1738693069.0,GuriTheCrypto,0,1.0,False
1ihobyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ihobyr/hes_gotta_be_the_one_were_so_pumped_to_begin_life/,He's gotta be the one. We're so pumped to begin life together.,"r/Marriage :

I (23F) found the one (23M) and I need to be reeled back in and given some reminders from people who've had successful marriages... Particularly Christian, but I'll take advice anywhere!

Context (stay with me, our story is a fun one):

We met when I was a month away from graduating, so I only got that much time with him initially (I still feel so cheated!). A mutual friend hooked us up as dates at his Christian fraternity's formal, and we hit it off IMMEDIATELY. Same sense of humor, laughing, giggling. I almost pissed myself in his Mustang. On our first 'date' (we got coffee so he could get to know me before the formal), he skipped class quietly so he could keep talking to me. Didn't tell me until months later!

I graduated in May 2023 and moved from school (Texas) back home (California) for a few months before finding a job in Wisconsin and moving there (September/October 2023). He supported me cheerfully, even though he was deeply saddened that I wasn't returning to TX. He was a December 2024 graduate (9 months younger than me) and still had over a year left, so he was still in TX. Nonetheless, he was in my corner the whole time. Never let his own bias get in the way of me continuing my life on my terms.

We kept in touch relatively consistently over text. At one point, he revealed his feelings toward me over FaceTime (he would go on to explain to me much later that he told me about his feelings after I'd left so that I wouldn't feel guilty or held back from leaving). I admitted I did see *something* between us, but I didn't know how it would work over the distance. Cue March of 2024 -- my birthday -- and he sent the most beautiful flowers to my office. The kicker? He requested the florist make an arrangement with *exactly* my preferences that he asked me about when I was still in Texas. He made a note of those details and recalled it almost a year later (apparently, this 'note' on his phone still exists, he updates it regularly, and I'm not allowed to see it! I've tried -- we have each other's passcodes!).

I didn't have my feelings for him before because I didn't really understand what love or relationships were supposed to feel like. Not to mention, we never really got the opportunity to date. I had overly optimistic outlooks with previous guys (only two, my relationship history is brief), and dismissive of red flags. But this? This is *so* different, in the best, most wholesome way.

By the time he sent me those flowers, I was already hating Wisconsin. I remember crying over lunch with my mom when I visited her for the holidays three months prior that I hated it after being there for a few months and how I was working two jobs, but we both acknowledged it might be a mix of growing pains and homesickness. So I should give it just a little more time and effort. I tried so hard to make a home for myself in Wisco, but I just couldn't. Nothing was working or sticking. And trust me, I'm an extrovert -- I put myself out there. The only thing keeping me going? My regular FaceTimes with my man-to-be, which involved looking into the future, venting my stresses, virtual movie nights.

So I asked my mom and my sister and my best friend whether or not I should move back to Texas after I spent a fair amount of time at this job I just got, about a year (the wise thing to do). I didn't want to be too reckless in my decision-making. But they all told me the same thing: do it. 'You didn't realize how much you loved TX until you left, and now's the age to find where you need to be,' essentially. Eventually, my 'if I return to Texas's became '*when* I return to Texas.'

So for the sixth time in two years (other history I won't go into, involving living in Italy), I moved. I had a kinda-sorta plan laid out, involving a second job (transfer as Trader Joe's crew) in case my first pursuit didn't work (a whole story within itself; I applied for a job that didn't exist, and they decided they needed one of me). But I didn't care. I wanted to do something new, to take a risk -- and it *is* working. As he counted, 510 days after he last saw me, we met again the day after I drove into town, and he asked me to be his girlfriend that day (Oct 6, 2024 <3)

He traveled to see my family in FL (my mom moved from California) for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, and I met his in Texas. So we've already traveled together.

He graduated, and we moved to a suburb of where we went to school. I initially moved to an unsafe area, and while we were looking for a place for him to live, I decided to apply to one of the properties I liked that was on his radar to get out of dodge. He was torn between mine and another property, and ultimately decided to go to mine because it made more financial sense. We're now neighbors, and he lives four doors down from me.

We've had communication hiccups, but they only end in calm discussions, introspection, and solutions. I've learned so much about myself since dating him. He makes everything better. He's always in my corner. Every problem we have -- which even then, are very small potatoes -- it never feels like I'm fighting him, because I always want to face it *with* him. He's my absolute best friend, and I'm grateful that I get to love him so dearly. I know, I know... The 'L' word came soon (1.5 months into dating), but remember, we've been talking and falling hard for each other since March of last year!

We've talked about future endeavors, and our visions align. He's very financially responsible and forward-thinking, realistic, and proactive. He wants to have a ring on my finger by the end of this year (!!), and said we'll start having the necessary conversations that need to be had around June, assuming life doesn't get in the way.

\*Inhale...\* So that's it. That's the tale. He is everything that I needed, and it only seems to get better. I learn that more and more each day, and he motivates me to be the best version of myself because I want that *for him.* He sees so much in me, and I in him. I don't want to do life without him, and that's that.

We don't believe in divorce. I want to ensure this relationship's success -- but I don't want to have any oversights. What do you guys think? I understand it's an interesting timeline, maybe a little fast, but... Is there anything I'm missing here for a happy, long marriage... Or is this for real?

**TLDR (I can't seem to make a long story short): I met my boyfriend and we clicked immediately before I moved away, where he continued to pursue me and keep in touch with me. That was over a year and a half ago when we met, but we've been dating for almost three months since I've been back. Things are going absolutely swimmingly -- better than I would've imagined -- and we want to be engaged by year's end. Is there anything I could be missing here, or is this all there is to it? Is there any reason to hold back?**

P.S.: My mom and dad got engaged two weeks after they met, and were married for 29 years until my father's unexpected passing in 2022. He is loved very dearly by her, even in death. <3 So clearly, knowing 'the one' early on may run in the family!

P.S.S.: At the formal that started it all between us... There was another couple in that group that had ALSO met there for the first time, and they just got engaged recently. We're attending their party in a few weeks. ;)",0,1738693030.0,Marriage,2,0.25,False

1iho99n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iho99n,F24 Desperate for Acne Advice,"Hi guys, I am 24F and desperately looking for help with my acne. I’ve battled acne for years and can’t find anything that works. I have been so several dermatologists over the years. It feels like they barely look at my skin tbh, I’ll come in with a printed list of all my routine products with the ingredients next to them. They just sort of scan my face and go yep do these antibiotics, yep use this clindamycin, yep use benzoyl peroxide. Why isn’t anything working?? The last photo is all the products I use. I am seriously so humiliated at this point. I am the only person in my life dealing with acne and im about to be 25. I want to try accutane but my partner doesn’t want me to do it because of the side effects, which I know are pretty severe. I have tried so much I feel exhausted and just ashamed of my face, I hate it. I already hate the way my face looks let alone with acne, please help. I’ve listed any information that might be helpful, as well as at the end I’ve listed previous things I’ve tried. Keep in mind when I try a product I introduce them one at a time and use consistently for a few weeks before deciding it doesn’t work (unless I have an allergic reaction). 

Routine:
My routine is exactly the same AM & PM with the exception of sunscreen. I use spot treatment occasionally.

•10% Benzoyl Peroxide Gel Spot Treatment
•Native Unscented Face Sunscreen w/Zinc Oxide SPF30
•Aquaphor just on my lips 

Background:
My skin is horribly textured and has constant blackheads. They are super easy to pop out after a hot shower and they just show up everywhere! Under the skin blemishes that are super painful. Scarring, lots of weird rash like areas. It’s itchy. 

I am very consistent with my routine! I never skip and make sure when I wear makeup to remove it thoroughly. I have no diet restrictions, I eat meat, some dairy, vegetables, fruit etc. I’d say decently balanced. I drink pretty much only water and coffee. 
I use Tide Free & Clear laundry detergent. I change my pillowcase every other night, only using each side once. I don’t touch my face and rarely pick (when I do it’s blackheads). I change my sheets often and wash my blankets often. I’m very clean. I shower once a day. 

Previous Products:

•FAB Ultra Repair Cream
•FAB Ultra Repair Oil-Control Moisturizer
•TO Salicylic acid, this made my skin go nuts

Once you have used it you should be able to just dish wash it and then reuse it forever. Making cultures goes even faster with it because you can just drop it in the media as is with 0 prep.  
  
My only concerns would be anything leeching into the media, corrosion depending on how good the ""stainless"" property of the material is, climbability for the flies, and the ability to keep the roll in the cup when tipping it over for feeding. Depending on how tightly you need to roll it up to give the flies enough surface area, it might not wash well in a dishwasher.

In theory, this should be the absolute best and most convenient available material to be able to culture flies with.",1,1738692821.0,DartFrog,17,1.0,False

I have a TON more coming, I hope to get as many up as possible over the next couple of weeks on my days off so I can clear out some of my notes lol. 

Since my first post here about Solstice Scents, my first indie perfume house (btw sorry I never replied to any comments, for some reason I don’t always get post comment notifications so I had no idea anyone actually replied! I'll have to go read them!) I have found a love for many other brands in just the past three-ish months. Looks like Cocoapink is no exception!

I also want to dedicate this set of reviews to a lovely lady I spoke to sometime after I placed my order(s), u/LibtardLaurie from the r/FemFragLab subreddit! So, she told me she wanted a cotton candy perfume that she could actually smell because after getting through COVID, she (like many others) has struggled with her sense of smell, so a lot of perfumes don’t smell good to her or aren’t strong enough. I suggested she check out Cocoapink but since I hadn’t tried them myself yet, I wanted to be sure to let her know how my orders went as soon as I’d gathered my thoughts!

So this one is for you, Laurie! ❤️


My rating scale:

0/10 oh fuck no. instant scrub. nausea inducing hell. 

1/10 triggered or upset my migraines or made me feel sick. scrub.

2/10 yeah ew, what did I do to deserve this unlawful punishment. CRIMINAL. scrubber.

3/10 I tried to love you but I think I hate you. couldn’t do a full wear test, but maybe didn’t scrub for a few hours.

4/10 I gave you a fair shot but my skin hates you, clearly. Didn’t scrub but I’ll pass. Maybe let you rest a little and hope that helps… 

5/10 - ehhh just not for me. I’d rather smell like marshmallows or vanilla cake. Will try to use up, but possibly will gift this to someone who may love it more. 

6/10 yeah I’d still rather smell like vanilla but it’s not bad. I will likely use what I have up.

7/10 we’re getting somewhere! This smells good, maybe would size up but not get a huge bottle. I like you!

8/10 oooh okay I see you, this is a pretty damn good one. a potential upsize (but prob not in the near future, there are others higher up on the list)

9/10 oh hell YES, this is a favorite. In the works of upsizing or fullsizing. 

10/10 I AM IN LOVE 😭 where have you been all my life? I refuse to die until I have this in the biggest size I can afford lol 


For reference, I'm a gourmand or fleurmand babe through and through. Some of my fave notes: vanilla, cake and marshmallow (a lot of my faves are marshmallows!) caramel, berries over fruits, orange blossom, vanilla orchid. lilac, lavender, rose. I like softer musks, pretty ambers, lemon (has to be a gourmand lemon, some citrus turn disgusting like wood cleaner on me) lychee, pumpkin… I could keep going but I think you get the vibe. Basically anything that’s a creamy vanilla or contains a nice vanilla with other additions to balance it, that’s my jam. Also like incense and smoke. 

Can’t stand aquatics or freshies. Don't like chocolate but I can get behind white chocolate. Most florals are gross on me. even if I like the smell they may induce my already chronic migraines… I work in a Sephora, so that kind of sucks lol. I want a gourmand, fleurmand or sometimes a fruity floral or something similar. Not into straight up fruit perfumes. 

My first order:

**Marshmallow Fireside** (10ml EDP spray, medium intensity) - toasted marshmallows over a roaring fire, Cocoapink’s rendition of my Bath & Body Works fave.

I placed two separate orders around the same time but this came first. I got a full size bottle of Marshmallow Fireside because I was reallllly thinking I would love it. I made the mistake of going for medium intensity Instead of SMAT, or Smell Me Across Town. Idk it wasn’t giving marshmallow fireside at all. There is a vanilla aspect.. but it’s more like burnt plastic than roaring fire. So sad. I do have a body butter of this scent coming so I will be sure to update you guys here if I prefer that. The B&BW candle is my all time favorite candle scent, I used to have a room spray that I would use as a perfume back in high school because I loved it so much. I will still be sure to give this scent a try in the oil formulation at some point since I tend to prefer oils anyway.. but yeah. I don’t even know how to describe this. I’ll try to use up my bottle but I would not repurchase, at least in the medium intensity spray format. I will never get anything but SMAT again lol. I would not call this a dupe at all but hey …maybe I just need to try a different format. Hehh *internal gaslighting*. this is the only scent I feel like is a little plasticky on me, by the way. I didn’t get that from any of my oils or body butters! But I understand why people may sometimes have that experience after smelling it in this perfume spray.

So I’m holding out hope that I just don’t like their EDPs..

I actually tried it again this morning (2/04/25) my kid needs to take a bath tonight because she got into my mother’s La Vie Est Belle by Lancôme (ewww why did I get her a travel spray for Christmas when I should have known she would just let my 6yo play with it and overspray it to oblivion) her hair still kinda smells like it one bath and two days later 🙄 so I detangled her hair and sprayed this through it just so it wouldn’t smell absolutely awful lmao. Since it’s not super strong it seems to make a great hair perfume! Smells good on her. But then I put a spritz on my wrist, it actually smells better like a month later. Less plastic, now I’m getting some light smokiness and a better vanilla marshmallow note. Still not a dupe and still not good enough for me but again, I’ll update you guys when I try the body butter or other formats before totally giving up on this. I wanted to love it! Just a solid “it’s okay. one day I’ll get through it”. It dries down into a lovely vanilla marshmallow, I think I really love their marshmallow. I have a dry oil of their marshmallow single note coming because its so lovely! This wear test took my rating from 3/10 to a 5/10.

Rating: 5/10. Sadness. The 15 year old in me is crushed. My search for a marshmallow fireside spot on dupe perfume continues…

**Prada Candy** (oil) dupe - caramel, musks, vanilla and benzoin.
Not bad. Original is better but doesn’t like to last on me, so I figured I would give this one a try. I mean it’s still beautiful. Will totally use this up and see if I like it enough to try in EDP form at some point. At the very least I could always use this under my Prada Candy perfumes to help improve longevity, or maybe even try a body butter at some point. I still need to test this under the OG or with my old signature scent, Prada Candy Kiss! I also have Candy Gloss. Running out of all three so I’m glad to have something else on hand that I could use to layer with other perfumes or to help my wear times of the originals I love so much. It’s not perfect but much better dupe of its OG than Marshmallow Fireside was. 

Rating: 7/10. Close enough for me to like it and use it up and I’d love to try other formats too. I want to layer this with orange blossom scents (to be more like Candy Kiss) or cherry scents (like Candy Gloss) and think I could have a lot of fun testing this with other notes as well to see what else goes with the Prada Candy DNA. I’m not mad at it.

**Black Cat in the Pumpkin Patch** (voluptuous body butter) - notes are rich amber resins, lemon curd, vanilla bean noel, Egyptian Musk and sweet pumpkin.

This beauty concludes my first Cocoapink order, wow. This is fucking fantastic. When I tried this, my jaw completely dropped open because this is such a heavenly scent. I get the vanilla, the pumpkin, the musky lemon amber… it’s divine. Obsessed and will definitely repurchase and consider trying an oil or something else. I bought two of these, one for me and one for a friend. I adore this scent! I mostly get an amber pumpkin with a lemon edge to it, very beautiful. i like the egyptian musk note too. I know my friend is going to love it whenever I can get it to her! I think it’s so beautiful, and a very unique scent. Can’t say I’ve ever smelled anything like it. Would 100% repurchase in a bigger size, and maybe get an oil to wear too. This is just stunning! I love how thick and moisturizing the Voluptuous Body Butter formula is, it’s perfect when you’re coming out of the shower or otherwise dealing with very dry skin. It’s been very cold and dry here in NH so I’m glad to have a couple scents of these! I already have several other scents coming… hehehe. Scent lasts several hours too after applying. so incredible. 

Rating: 10/10, this is so much better than I expected. Cocoapink made me realize that pumpkin is a note I do like, preferably when there’s no cinnamon to it!

My second order:

**Angel Food Cake** (Voluptuous Body Butter) - fresh baked angel food cake.

This one is more bready of an angel food cake than I’ve ever tried so I’m not sure if I really like the scent, but I’m already halfway through the tub. I wanted something more airy and fluffy, maybe with some whipped cream or something but it’s just a sweet-ish bready cakey scent. Trying to use it up because idk, I love angel food cake with whipped cream and strawberries so maybe it’s just not my vibe without other elements to add to it. To me it does not smell the way a plain angel food cake tastes, so a little bit of a let down. Right now it’s been my go to out of the shower because it’s an easy one to throw on, the scent isn’t *extremely* overpowering so I don’t find it causes issues with my perfumes, but sometimes I still get whiffs of it throughout the day. I try to put it everywhere but my wrists usually and then I don’t notice it as much after like hour or two. It’s not bad, there’s just something about it that throws me off with the scent. But I love the formula and will happily use it up, but next time I’d rather try a different scent than repurchase. Would not try this scent again.

Rating: 5.5 for the scent, just not my vibe. Would rather there be a creamy vanilla to it instead of that yeasty bready weirdness I’m getting.

**Cotton Candy Dreams** (oil sample) - cotton candy raspberry frosting with their Triple Vanilla Dream fragrance.

I wish I got a regular cotton candy instead of this one, it’s not bad at all but I get much more of that raspberry buttercream than cotton candy. I will be sure to try one of the cotton candies though! I want to try Spun Sugar next time I order, which is described as “a more realistic cotton candy blend with fresh strawberry, sugar and sweet vanilla.” But for now I will deal with this one until I can get a proper cotton candy fix in my perfume collection. It’s very pretty, very sweet though so I can see this being too cloying for some. It’s almost too sweet for me! So when I first wore this, it was only a few days out of the mail and the scent faded before I was even done my makeup that day. So not even 40 mins after I put it on. However, with a couple weeks of rest, this one has turned into one of the most long lasting scents I got. So if you order from Cocoapink and get the samples, don’t fret until you’ve given them some time to rest because they definitely benefit from it, as most oils do. I like this but I would rather try some of the other cotton candy offerings instead of repurchasing. Not bad though!

Rating: 6/10. Not cotton candy enough for me!

**Fear of Pumpkins** (oil) sweet pumpkin inside soft pale cupcakes with whipped buttercream frosting, sugared pralines & pumpkin bread.

From my notes: This is one I got for my witchy pumpkin loving bestie, she’s getting married this fall and we’re going to go in on the fall vibes for her makeup (this is going to be my first solo wedding as a MUA) anyway I know she loves pumpkin everything (also giving her the BCITPP body butter). I grabbed her this perfume sample but ofc I need to know what it smells like first! and ohhhh my god. It’s pumpkin cupcakes with buttercream frosting, it’s so delicious. I’m definitely getting the pralines too, then there’s also a pumpkin bread note that’s just as yummy and it swirls together with the cupcakes and frosting beautifully. I can tell there are two types of baked good notes in here. Like wtf why didn’t I get myself one lol. I want to try this in body butter format as well, it’s heavenly if you love pumpkin gourmands! So good. I will rock this one today and probably purchase for myself at some point. Just so beautiful and sweet. It’s such a nice pick me up after my two dentist appointments lol! The only thing I would change about this was make it into a cream cheese frosting note instead of buttercream. I fucking love cream cheese frosting and I hope I can find something cakey that has that as a note one day! 

Rating: 100/10. I bought a rollerball of this because I loved it so much, I would go as far to say it’s my favorite from both orders I’ve gotten so far. Who knew I was a pumpkin girlie? Not me. I also have a body butter on the way.. I want to make pumpkin cupcakes ASAP. I could not recommend this enough!

**Fear of Ghosts** (oil) -  toasted marshmallow, puffed vanilla marshmallows, smoky vanilla, bonfire smoke and grains of white rice.

Ummm… bubblegum? What is going on. I am literally just getting bubblegum. I HATE BUBBLEGUM. Reminds me of that nasty kid’s mouthwash I used to use before realizing mint was far superior. You know, I saved this one for last because I was fully expecting it to be my favorite since I love marshmallow vanilla anything, but that’s just not what I get at all. Definitely disappointed! I wanted to love this one sooo bad and was wicked excited about it! It does eventually fade down into their basic vanilla but the whole bubblegum journey I went on was a bummer. Not for me. I did get a compliment at work though when I was shade matching an older woman, she said I smelled delightful lol! She laughed at the name when I told her. I mean it’s not like it’s a horrible scent but I can’t get past the blast of bubblegum. Maybe if it only lasted until it dried I’d deal with it, but I just am not a fan :( sad day. I hope that with time it will actually become a nice marshmallow scent, so I will revisit in a month or two before making any final decisions. it’s just not for me.

Rating: 4/10 fml why bubblegum why are you doing me dirty like that. I asked for marshmallow not you :(

**Candy Fluff/Snow Fairy** (dry oil) - bubblegum (broooo😒) apples, pears, lemon drops, cotton candy, crushed Madagascar Vanilla. 

I’m not sure why the fuck I bought this lol, I must have not read the notes right because apparently there’s both apples, pears and bubblegum in here and those are all notes I don’t like at all in perfume. I accidentally sprayed this right at my chest while cleaning my vanity and was instantly annoyed lol. Nope. I’m giving this to one of my besties. My THIRD bestie lol, my most recent bestie. My third real friend lmao. So I got a Haus of Gloi pumpkin butter for in the scent Lavender Sugar, which is stunning btw. I also have an Innisfree Vit C serum I got as training product from Sephora but I already have tried that before and I don’t need more vitamin c skincare so I figured she could have it. she’s my newest best friend I met in esthetician school. then I am also giving her a couple extra samples I didn’t vibe with or totally fall in love with, like HoG Strawberry Angel Food Cake, Caramel Apple, Vanilla Chai Cookie and Black Hearted Tart Matcha Mallow. She may like them better. But I figured I’d just give her this dry oil spray too, I mean it’s not a bad scent at all, but it’s not something I’d like to smell like for an entire day. 

She ended up liking it thank god. I have since bought a Marshmallow dry oil because I loved the formula, just didn’t jive with the scent. I want more of their dry oils! It was so silky smooth when I rubbed it into my chest and hydrated some very flaky dry rough patches I had going on, but I ended up washing it off since I can’t stand the pear-apple-bubblegum scent. Grossssto me.

3/10. Bye candy fluff slash snow fairy :( cute name though.

**Marshmallow Cake on Mondays** (oil) Marshmallow plus Cake on Mondays, which is sponge cake, almond extract, vanilla, cinnamon and cream cheese buttercream.

I should have prob tried the Noel version but so far I’m not sure about this. I got it even though I knew if it smelled a lot like marzipan from the almond extract, I’d be annoyed. I hate marzipan/almond!! That’s what I’m getting freshly applied. I was also wary of the spice notes because any cinnamon notes tend to amplify like crazy on me. I still bought it because they had me at cream cheese buttercream frosting and I looove cream cheese frosting. It’s the best frosting imo. 

As it dries I’m getting more of a cinnamon scent. I can’t tell if I’d prefer the marzipan scent or the cinnamon lol, neither are my cup of tea. I guess I’m glad to have tried it but if anything I can layer with VBN with my next purchase, I hope to pick up a body butter to get a similar vibe to MCOMN. Yeah, the cinnamon is there. But not too overpowering. I don’t want to scrub it but I will not care if it fades away lol. Right now I’m finally getting some cream cheese frosting but it’s like a mostly cinnamon frosting. Where is the marshmallow and cake 😭 unfortunately this is a not a fave. It’s still sweet and pretty but I’d rather someone else smell like this instead of me. I totally get why it’s popular but two of the main notes aren’t for my skin or my tastes! Lasted a good 10 hours or so. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the cinnamon but once it disappeared toward the end of its wear, I liked it a lot more because it turned into a gorgeous sweet vanilla marshmallow. 

Update: gave to my esthi bestie along with Candy Fluff. I liked it once it dried down to a sweet marshmallow hours later, but at that point I’d rather have a straight up marshmallow to avoid the almond and cinnamon. However… I still ordered a sample of the Noel version to try lmfao. Oops.

Rating: 5/10. only because cream curse frosting and the marshmallow goodness at the end there. 

**Boo Boo Lemon Noel** (oil) - lemon curd and Vanilla Bean Noel.

This is a really nice gourmand lemon scent, exactly the kind of sweet vanillic lemon scent I love. It’s beautiful. I already have Haus of Gloi’s Lemon Tart and Lemon Marshmallow which are both in this same sort of category, so I definitely didn’t need this but I will happily use up my sample. It’s sweet and satisfies my lemon vanilla cravings lol. I am still trying to decide if I like this or the Haus of Gloi samples I have more, but they’re all very similar so I wouldn’t encourage anyone to have more than one. Leaning towards Lemon Marshmallow being my fave.. undecided. Would totally buy this again, just maybe instead a perfume oil I’d try it as a sugar scrub or body butter. Been dyinggg to try the sugar scrub! I plan to order one next time (: this is a nice easy to wear lemon scent, so I’d recommend it. It also lasted like 6 hours! No cake note but I do get a lemon cake vibe from this, or like the lemon buttercream frosting you’d find sitting on beautiful little yellow cupcakes. Very enjoyable to me.

Rating: 8.5/10, maybe an unnecessary purchase but I’m glad to have it. Would buy again. 

**Gooey Caramel** (oil) - old fashioned salted buttery caramel.

First time I wore this I got a weird alcoholic scent alongside a beautifully realistic caramel, but that alcohol threw me off. However that was maybe 10 days or so after I got it, and now it’s been almost a month and that isn’t a problem anymore. Just straight up sweet sticky caramel goodness. I like it. I think it will be fun to layer things with as well. It’s definitely living up to the name! Lasted like 5 hours, and my minimum is usually around 4 because I don’t mind reapplying and sometimes like to switch up my perfume throughout the day. So 5 hours is good, but idk if I want to smelll ONLY like caramel all the time lol. So I will be layering this with some other scents to see if I can find a couple staple combos to wear around! Perfect for days I’m craving something sweet and delicious though. I loveeee chewy caramel candies and caramel coffee so I found this one very satisfying for my sweet tooth cravings lol. 

Rating: 7/10, points deducted for the alcoholic scent I got at first but otherwise it’s great. Just gotta be a little patient. Which… I am not lol. I would like to eventually try this in another format, like a bath and body product. Maybe a shampoo or something idk. I think that would be fun!

**Pumpkin Fried Ice Cream** (oil) - sweet creamy pumpkin, fried ice cream, pale vanilla ice cream, vanilla beans.

This pumpkin note seems to have cinnamon while the one in Fear of Pumpkins did not but I still like it. The cinnamon and spice never became too much on my skin, which thank god because cinnamon is a death note for me. I like this but I want to try more of their Pumpkin offerings, like Pumpkin Waffle Delight or Bonfire Pumpkin next (: definitely still getting some beautiful creamy vanilla to it. It’s a good fall scent, I can see myself wearing it a lot more when fall rolls back around! More of a pumpkin spice ice cream to me. But mostly pumpkin. I would be rating a lot lower if that cinnamon became overpowering, so I’m glad to say that was not the case! It’s great and I can see pumpkin spice lovers enjoying this a ton! Makes me wanna try their Pumpkin Chai Tea scent as well.

Rating: 7/10. Maybe I’d get it as a lotion or scrub instead, but I would not upsize. for now I’d rather try other things before thinking about ordering again. Will likely use that sample up by the time winter comes back later this year! Definitely not a year round scent for me.

**Homicidal Girlfriend** (oil) - vanilla pancakes, blueberry, black leather, musk, spicy florals and woods, a threat of gunpowder. 

From my notes: this one is for my other bestie. We’ve been best friends since high school, it was a crazy thing because she actually started out dating one of my best guy friends. Except THEN one day he tells me they broke up and made a move on me and kissed me. I didn’t believe him and it was super weird (this was the only time anything ever happened between us back when we were like sophomores in high school lol) so I immediately texted her and asked, then when she said no I ofc told her what happened. Because girl code. I found out that he in fact had not been broken up with. Her response to me was “at first I wanted to beat you up reading this but I appreciate you telling me” and we’ve been best friends ever since. We quickly found out we had a LOT in common. Lost our v card to the same douchebag lol, for example, and then a lot of traumatic shit. Ever since that day we’ve always had WEIRD parallels in our lives, like we both ended up with absolute scumbag guys just a few years apart and unfortunately we lost contact for several years as I dealt with an abuser and then a couple years later, she dealt with the same situation. Our abusive relationships both lead us to becoming heroin addicts and ultimately I got sober in 2018. she got clean just before we came back into each other’s lives a few years ago. We both found new guys that both helped us get out of the abusive situations as well.

Anyway, she has been through a lot with her new man (since I first wrote this, they are now engaged sooo I swear he better be on his best behavior 🙃) and I thought this one was perfect considering all the shit they've gone through. It seems like things are okay now but like.. looks can be deceiving. Honestly not sure how to feel about it but I want her to be happy so I support her decisions even if I may disagree. I thought she would think the name is funny, at least I hope she does. I just had to try it before I give it to her!

So I put it on and wow, yeah I like this! It’s different, the gunpowder is present right away. This is definitely a badass scent. It reminds me of something BPAL would make. Freshly applied, I definitely get that gunpowder note, leather with a hint of blueberry, musk and definitely a spicy floral element. This is an interesting scent and I like it so far. I hope the vanilla pancakes come out a little bit though! 

I spoke too soon. I’m getting the vanilla pancakes on the dry down lol. It’s very pretty, sweet with a twist of musk and leather. Definitely sexy, I like this a lot. It makes me wanna throw on my leather jacket, go after my enemies and expose them as the evil lying losers they are lmao. (That’s an insane story for another day).

This perfume lives up to the name and the overall vibe. I hope my best friend likes it as much as I do! As it wore I noticed the vanilla and woods more but the gunpowder is still there. This is a great scent. I would repurchase a sample for myself (: update: it’s coming like next month lol.

Rating: 9/10, would wear this when one day I get revenge on my enemies (former loved ones and relatives who tried to destroy me lol. Well they failed) and publish my exposé. I will wear this as come for them because the truth WILL out. lmao. bad bitch scent. Fuck them all (; 

**Lychee-Rose Macarons** (oil) - French almond macarons, pink tea roses, fresh lychee fruit and whipped buttercream. 

I love lychee, I love macarons, love sweet fruity roses as a combo, and I LOVE lychee boba tea so I figured I couldn’t go wrong with this one. It’s so pretty, like what a lovely light fleurmand. As I applied it, I noticed a faint whiff of like, almond flour or almond extract which isn’t something I particularly love, however in macarons I have no problem with it. It faded into a pretty sweet rose with a lychee background quickly and now it’s just a stunning fruity floral. I am enjoying this a lot and I honestly should get myself a lotion or linen spray of this before they run out of the materials to keep making it! This was one of the first scents I saw on Cocoapink’s website maybe a year or two ago now and I was super tempted to order but I just didn’t have the money at the time. So I was super excited to finally get to try it! It’s definitely as good as expected. Mellowed out into a sugared rose, very beautiful. I hope I can grab a dry oil or something before its gone forever when they can no longer source the ingredients. I was shocked it was still around since it said limited availability when I first discovered the Cocoapink site a while back. Glad I got to try it!

Rating: 8/10, love this so much but sometimes with lychee I have to be in a specific mood. I bet I'll wear this a lot more in the spring. Love lychee and rose together! 

**Violet Pound Cake** (oil) -  freshly baked pound cake squares, wild candied violet petals, confectioners’ sugar. 

I really like violet scents and this is no exception! I get those cakey pound cake notes right away with sugared violet swirled in. It’s not my favorite, I prefer Violet Mallow by Solstice but it’s still a great scent that I will happily use up. Another nice fleurmand! This one didn’t last as long though, maybe 4 hours. At first the pound cake was much more promiment than the violet, then at one point it kinda flipped. I preferred it when the cakiness fell towards the background.

Rating: 7/10, I would prefer this in a sugar scrub. Pretty though!


Before I frequented this subreddit, I saw a post like two years ago now about Cocoapink which lead me on a spiral down their website. I created a cart with Lychee Rose and Violet Poundcake back then but I just couldn’t get around to trying yet, so I am happy I finally was able to. Worth the long turn around times in my opinion. I mean your mileage may vary, I have friends who dislike Cocoapink because of the perfume base scents so I would definitely try for yourself if you’re interested. I ordered a few vanillas from them because I didn’t end up trying any of the straight up vanillas, I totally forgot! So I will be sure to write more reviews later on!

About longevity: I feel like for most of these I get at least 4-5 hours minimum now that they’ve rested, so I’m happy with that. Homicidal Girlfriend and Fear of Pumpkins lasted the longest, like 12 hours each! I’m very happy with my order, there were only a couple where I was like yeah I wouldn’t want to buy at least one other thing in this scent eventually. Luckily I had a pretty high hit rate with Cocoapink and I’m so excited that I finally got to try this house! The sillage definitely seems to vary scent to scent, I think the ones with more vanilla seem to stick around or project more, at least on me. 


Back to Laurie - I think it would be worth testing out a couple of the sample vials to see if you like any of the scents enough to either try as a perfume spray, rollerball or whatever. You could also try the Linen Sprays, a lot of people enjoy sampling those because they can be used like a body mist! I haven’t tried any yet but I do have a couple coming in soon. And I bet you’d LOVE the body butters! I’ve only tried the voluptuous version but I hear the coco mango body butter is a little more lightweight, hydrating and incredible on dry skin so I can’t wait to try some I have coming in!

I hope that if you do buy any cotton candy perfumes from here that you love them! Please let us know if you do! 

..

Thank you for reading, everybody! Sorry I know I write a *lot*, I will just never be one of those people who can conclude her thoughts into a couple of sentences lmao. As a writer that’s just not me haha!

Hope you all have a great rest of your week, babes! Can’t wait to tell you more about some of the perfumes I’ve been testing over the last couple of months ❤️ What are your fave Cocoapink scents? Have you tried any of these? Let me know (:
