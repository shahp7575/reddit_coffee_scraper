Once again we come together to talk about Catwoman as issue 75 has dropped. No preamble this time, no talk of coffee or nocturnal lifestyles here. Let’s get right to it. I’ve read Catwoman issue 75. By the end of this review I will have read it two or three times more. Let’s talk about it.

Torunn Gronbekk delivers another solid issue. The writing is as strong as ever and she pairs very well with Patricio Delpeches art. Her caption work, her Selina Kyle remain highlights of the book. Her character work, fleshing out the new characters in Selina’s past as Evie Hall is great. More on that in the writing section.
Delpeche is the third artist on Catwoman in the last 8 issues. I think he’s only slated to be the main artist on 75-76, which does make sense to me as 76 is part 2 of “Never let them see blood”. He does a fantastic job across the board. His style is more fluid than Marianna’s so everything feels less stationary. It has a Darwin Cooke feel to it. More on Delpeches art in the art section but spoiler it’s just a great improvement. 

Anyway! Let’s talk about what happens in issue 75. 

Standard pre-summary statement: I'm just going full caution and blocking everything. It's honestly just easier that way. This was a fantastic issue, definitely read it first before unblocking everything as there you’ll find spoilers.

>! We open in Budapest, years ago. Two days before everything went wrong, weird early aside but the lower case on Budapest sort of bugs me. Anyway this issue is full on set in the past. We start there and stay there throughout. Surprisingly there is no framing device/scene. Given how issue 74 ended with Selina injured and who appeared to be Shota finding her…I not quite expected but thought we’d see her dreaming about what happened. I think the way it’s handled in the issue is better than it would have been with that framing device so I’m glad it isn’t here.!<

>! Also some house keeping, for this review I’ll most likely use Selina mainly but may go with Evie instead. The captions are of course Selina but she’s fully in her Evie identity.!<

>! We find Selina in the midst of stage one of a heist as she sneaks into a room to take pictures of documents. In the room is a blind folded man hanging by his wrists. He’s enjoying himself, mistaking Selina for Clara and being none the wiser as she gets what she came for. The whole opening scene is a showcase of the crew, and how they gather information they need for a heist. It’s beautifully handled.!<

>! A side note, I know…another so soon. The character designs, the clothes, body types, faces are nicely diverse compared to the previous issues. Saying this makes me feel like I’m being harsh on Marianna who did a solid job but you can tell who everyone is. They stand out from each other easily. You don’t run into the issue of  men looking the same for example. Speaking of clothes, Selina’s black and sheer dress is beautiful and with the long hair she has a Michelle Pffiefer or BTAS vibe.!<

>! The caption work is as always amazing. We learn why Selina stays as Evie, why she stays with her crew. It was fun, reckless, thrilling, dangerous, fun, we see how close she is to her friends, how much she cares. We also are introduced to Frankie through those captions.!<

>! Frankie is a highlight. I love her and it’s only been one issue. She’s our first new character of the issue. Frankie like Suzy is part of the crew showcased in the first part of the opening. The heist they’re pulling is on a wealthy family. Frankie playing the role of the outrageous heiress. Understanding the intricate societal norms, how to dress, and what to say. According to Selina she knows them better than anyone, able to easily navigate the circles without actually being one of the wealthy. So good that even Selina doesn’t know what was part of the character and what wasn’t. Selina likes and trusts Frankie, and Torunn does a good job showing you why she would. How much she likes her is as usual up for debate, the look she gives one of the guys, Ben who interrupts them might imply it’s more than just friends but that could just be my read. Also we meet Clara…no that doesn’t seem important. What is important is that we find out that Ben’s family, the marks are in Saint-Tropez !<

>! Suzy Sin cuts in, currently working to access the computer system. She tells them what information they need from Ben, a pet, do they have a dog. The feel of these three as friends is conveyed perfectly. They feel like they know each other, work well together. You can tell how much they care about each other. Delpeches art sells everything. They’re interrupted by nuns and pigs. Frankie uses one of the baby pigs to learn that Ben has a dog named de Gaulle, which gives Suzy what she needs to access their system including cameras. A nice touch here is that Suzy has a stress toy, one you squeeze. Anyway while she gains access and can now see the party, the crowd is huge, Suzy sees that the nuns are strippers. I like how somewhat flustered Suzy sounds when Selina confirms that they are in fact stripping.!<

>! We leave the party and jump to Saint-Tropez, to catch up with Long John and Shota. They are working on another part of the plan, which essentially entails faking credentials as the best security company in the area, SNK. Long John, the con man uses a renovating property to convince. We get see why he was so good at selling resort property before his death in issue 74. While John talks to the rep, learning their procedures and strict routines, Shota playing the role of a worker, uses a flash drive to get into the SNK system.!<

>! The full crew reunites in Saint-Tropez the next day, including Theodore Belov. I love this whole it’s straight out of a heist movie and it’s done so well. First we meet new characters and part of the crew Dewey and Sugar. The plan is then laid out like this: thanks to the access they gained from Ben Fourniers personal information they gained access to the Fourniers personal information, giving them eyes all over the property and a way to trigger an alarm. It’s the Fourniers they’re looking to rob. The alarm is then intercepted and huge crew impersonates SNK security. The Fourniers will be at a gala, Frankie and John will have eyes on them at the gala while the rest complete the heist. Dewey and Sugar are driver and back up.!<

>!Of course in the way of a heist movie, things aren’t simple. Theodore is on edge, has been for a time, not enough to make Selina leave but the fun might be ending. Theodore adds Anton and Donny to the crew, disregarding Evies protest even while treating her as the head of the crew. Selina has doubts about the changes to the plan and the crew, Sugar has questions about what they’re stealing, what’s in the files? The safe? Frankie diffuses the situation by bringing up the white party that night. It looks like everyone’s attending!<

>!The white party scene is less about the party or about the heist instead more about Selina herself. Selina and Shota, walking with their arms around each others waist surrounded by the active party happening around them, the drunk wealthy with no inhibitions. It’s difficult to not say that Evies relationship with Shota wasn’t deeper, I’m leaning toward former lovers or close. Anyway, this two page scene is for Selina, to show who she is, how she thinks. First saying that she used to think money is all she needed to solve her problems, that she would make a good socialite but after all the time she’s been around the rich, she’s not sure if there was such a thing as a good socialite. The idea of being a good socialite first makes me think of how Catwoman was portrayed in the past but also to her life growing up poor, the rich would look like glamorous people with perfect lives. I need to think on this more but it’s an interesting bit of dialogue.!<

>! Selina isn’t the only one who knows somethings wrong, Shota who knows Theodore longer knows it to. He’s willing to leave, go away with Evie. This annoyed Selina, that he could just walk away from this. From the job, from his identity. These lines are at the core of the book I think “It’s not that easy. You know…to leave everything behind. Reinvent everything…it’s harder than you think.” That is what Shota is suggesting and Selina knows from experience, after all she reinvented herself as Evie Hall, leaving Gotham behind. The option to reinvent has come up a few times throughout the run so far. Selina refusing twice to not abandon Selina again.!<

>!Shota who again says he can leave everything behind but her, now stays because he knows she won’t leave. Selina annoyed with him not only that he was willing to leave the job, the team after all the work that took weeks, the money…but most of all she was annoyed he’d ask what he knew she wouldn’t leave. We’re left with a cute moment, Shota telling her again if she asks, they can leave. Evies safe word is platypus, kind of wondering if that’ll come up again.!<

>! The previous two pages give us a look into Selina’s head,her view on the rich and on abandoning a job, what age believes. I love the dialogue, the caption work, the scene construction. Just a solid two pages.!<

>! Finally we reach the night of the robbery, just a quick aside…I really love the text of the day, the location. It feels so much like a movie. Anyway, the plan starts with Frankie and Long John with Sugar head off to the Gala. I like that it’s Selina who compliments Frankie on how she looks in the dress. It’s cute.!<

>!The addition of Anton who she can’t control and Donny who she doesn’t know already causes the crew issues. Anton second guessing, causing Suzy to be even more nervous to the point she’s chewing on her stress toy. Theodore adding the turn to the crew is throwing everything off. The caption work, Selina’s inner thoughts run throughout the robbery. The trigger of course comes and Suzy intercepts. They’re on. The stress toy again is such a genius addition to the scene and to Suzy. How badly she mauls the thing coupled with a stammer/stutter shows just how anxious she is. Selina reassures her but the way the anxiety is illustrated is great.!<

>! The plan goes swimmingly to start, the crew know their roles as they enter the home. Selina and Shota focusing on the actual robbery but Anton and Donny have their own plan, gathering all the Fournier staff. We’re introduced to de Gaulle the friendly dog and the security guards. Selina gaining access to both bedroom and office to check for a compromised system.!<

>! Eventually people will be tired of me…if they aren’t already, talking about Selina’s captions but they tell so much. Selina talking about how stealing, no matter what it is, as long as someone tries to keep it safe, or a triumph. Now as far as they know, they’re there to steal information which as we already know is Theodore’s thing. He has a vault of secrets after all on everyone including Selina.!<

>! Things start to go wrong when Selina finds a safe and checks if the cameras are on…and discovers Mitya Belov is observing. This sets Suzy’s anxiety off. Selina not having a chance to break into the safe. Suzy restarted the system and the guard with Shota returns to the office. Outside the everyone’s been gathered. Selina begins to explain the cover story with a gun goes off. The guard is called but like Selina said it’s to late. We find de Gaulle dead…and yes I’m heartbroken. Good boy de Gaulle.!<

>! Donny kills the guard and lets them in one what’s happening. They’re killing everyone to send a message to the Fourniers for Theodore, Selina finding everyone killed by Anton. The whole job has gone wrong. The issue ends here.!<

Ok, let’s talk writing.

This section is actually surprisingly difficult to write without sounding like a broken record. Torunn is fantastic. She managed to keep a story set up, the heist gone wrong from feeling cliched. She did that by making sure the characters were likable, people you could care for. Torunns Selina is as always on point for me. The way she showcases Selina’s thoughts and feelings, her knowledge of how to run a heist, plan and how to lead. The character work, who they are and their relationships to each other still highlights of the run. Torunn is able to move the story forward in a way that feels organic or evenly paced. The reveals are handled well and the way she fleshes out the crew, works perfectly for me. I can only hope that Torunn keeps Selina with a crew after this storyline ends because she handles it so well. Said this last issue but it bears repeating, I wish this book was getting more attention. It deserves more love. For this issue Torrun is paired with Patricio on art and they work perfectly together.

Patricios art is fantastic. It’s interested, just the right amount of stylized and works well with the story. The character designs are unique enough from eachother so that telling people apart is easier. Men look like different men. The body shapes are more diverse and I love the design choices. There isn’t a ton of action but Patricios art has movement to it. I need to call out the expressions as being maybe some of the best in the run. They convey how the characters are feeling perfectly. The panel layout, and just art choices in general are fantastic. And of course the color work of Delpeche works perfectly with his art.

The colors are for the most part lovely, a little flat but it fits that Darwin Cooke esque feel. The shading and the color choices are on point. It has a watercolor painterly feel that I practically adore that no don’t new to the book but it works so well with this issue. From the party, scene on the boat, to the white party ahd to the heist, everything looks beautiful overall. I particularly love how lights are handled, the reflections are lovely. 

Let’s wrap this thing up.

Torunns run on Catwoman remains strong. The writing is consistently great. The character work is solid across the board especially when it comes to the new characters. They’re interesting and fun. I only love Suzy more and Frankie is practically divine, she’s so very fun. The mystery, finally being revealed is interesting but there’s more to learn and I’m an excited to learn more. I want to see what Torunn does with Selina every month. I want the run to continue. 

I said this last week but it bears repeating: I look forward to this book every month, that’s maybe the highest praise I can give.
As always, if you’re reading Catwoman, I hope that you’re loving it as much as I am. If you aren’t reading, I really hope you consider jumping in. The TPB is currently dated for 7/1/2025 on Amazon. IMO you won’t be disappointed.

So far I haven’t missed a week and this one’s no different. These still take longer than they should and are later than I like so i apologize for that. Gotham City Sirens: Unfit for Orbit was just announced and yes I plan to review all five issues. Let’s see if I manage it come July.

As always apologies for missed spoilers and typos. 

Anyway see you same Cat week, same Cat channel.

(I'm 22F),"Just need to vent and also get some advice because this Easter long weekend has gone from a cute lil getaway to me feeling like a mum on a school trip.

So I’m 22F, my boyfriend Liam is 23M, and his best mate Dan is 24M. We’re all staying in a hotel down the coast for the weekend – planned it a while ago just for a chill break, beach, drinks, sleep in, no dramas. Liam and Dan have been best mates for years, and usually they’re tight as. Like, always joking around, finishing each other’s dumb sentences, never a dull moment.

But for whatever reason, this trip has been *non-stop* pettiness between them. From literally the first night, they started getting snarky over little things. Dan cracked the shits because Liam used the coffee mug from the hotel room that Dan had apparently “claimed.” Then Liam made a joke about Dan’s haircut – which he’s done before without issue – and Dan just fully gave him the silent treatment for hours. When we went for a drive, Dan kept giving Liam shit about how slow he drives, acting like a backseat parent, and Liam eventually just snapped and told him to walk next time.

Even stupid stuff like who’s better at cooking got weird. We made dinner in the little kitchenette one night and they were actually trying to one-up each other over who could cook sausages “properly.” Then it was Mario Kart in the room and they ended up yelling at each other over “cheating” and rules that they made up on the spot. I'm just sitting there like... is this what I signed up for?

Any time we try to do something relaxed – go for a walk, hang by the pool, even just sit and watch a movie – one of them finds a way to make it awkward. And they both act like the other one’s being a dick, so neither wants to back down. Liam reckons Dan’s being moody and Dan says Liam’s got an attitude lately. No one’s saying what’s *actually* going on and I’m just stuck in the middle trying to keep the peace like a human buffer.

It’s honestly wrecked the vibe and I’m so over it. I was looking forward to this weekend so much and now I’m just counting down until we go home. I miss when they were being goofy and laughing and not acting like grumpy siblings stuck in a car for too long.

Is there *any* way I can reset the mood or help them sort this out? I don’t wanna be pushy or turn into the mediator, but it’s making the trip a bit miserable and I’d love for them to just chill out and enjoy the rest of the time. Do I talk to them? Get them to talk to each other? Or do I just let them ride it out and keep my headphones in?

Would love advice from anyone who’s dealt with this kinda weird friend tension before. Especially when the two guys involved are clearly not gonna talk about their feelings like actual adults lol.",1,1745042444.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1k2piub,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketCrunchAI/comments/1k2piub/the_coffeeshop_quants/,The Coffee‑Shop Quants,"At 7:28 a.m. in Los Angeles a 26‑year‑old software engineer named Maya O’Connell sips a cold brew while her laptop back‑tests an equity‑options strategy she wrote in Python. Five minutes later the code pushes live orders through a broker’s API—commission‑free, fractional‑share, and, if all goes well, profitable. Ms. Iyer is part of the fastest‑growing species on the trading floor that no longer needs a trading floor: do‑it‑yourself quant (often stylized online as “Kwon”) traders, retail investors who deploy algorithms once reserved for Ph.D.’s in glass‑walled investment banks.

Their rise is reshaping the market in ways large and small, from the boom in zero‑day options to the overnight popularity of chart‑heavy TikTok channels. For millions of newcomers the question is no longer whether to trade, but how to survive a marketplace that feels like a videogame running at real‑money speed.

Zero Commissions: The Spark

The modern retail boom traces back to October 1, 2019, when the major online brokerages simultaneously slashed equity commissions to zero. Academic work that treats the event as a natural experiment finds that the price cut triggered a “significant increase in retail ownership” and a mirror‑image decline in institutional holdings, especially at companies that were already retail favorites. In plain English: once tickets to the show were free, the bleachers filled up.

Volume followed. Average daily U.S. share turnover jumped above 10 billion in 2020 and has never looked back. Cboe data show that even as volatility eased in 2023‑24, total share volume stayed lofty, a break with the historic rule that calm seas mean sleepy tape. The constant churn tells us retail traders are no longer episodic visitors—they are structural.

Technical Analysis Finds New Converts

A decade ago candlestick charts and Fibonacci retracements occupied the fringe of Wall Street. Today they animate Discord servers with names like “Chart‑Bros” and rack up tens of millions of TikTok views. The appeal is obvious: technical analysis requires no earnings models or Ph.D.’s, only patterns that can be scraped, coded and shared. Retail‑attested orders on Cboe’s EDGX exchange—one lens into mom‑and‑pop activity—averaged 147 million shares a day in the third quarter of 2024, up 176 percent from 2018. Much of that flow arrives in bite‑size market or limit orders generated by chart‑driven screeners.

Day‑trading, once caricatured by the dot‑com meltdown, is now a lifestyle brand. Influencers tout “VWAP taps” and “supply‑zone fades,” and live‑stream their P&L in real time. What’s different: today’s day‑traders borrow liberally from quant playbooks—moving‑average crossovers run through code, Bollinger‑band breakouts wrapped inside if‑then loops. The technical purists and the quants are converging.

Options: The New Playground

If zero commissions opened the door, cheap options blew out the walls. The Options Clearing Corporation cleared 12.2 billion contracts in 2024, a fifth consecutive record; equity options alone jumped 16 percent to 6.5 billion.

Inside that surge sits the phenomenon of 0‑DTE, or zero‑day‑to‑expiration, contracts—options that vanish by the closing bell. In the fourth quarter of 2024 they averaged 1.5 million trades per day and accounted for 51 percent of S&P 500 option volume. Day‑traders prize them for leverage; quants prize them for data density. Regulators, meanwhile, worry they may amplify intraday swings. For the moment, the appetite shows no sign of dieting.

DIY Algorithms Go Mainstream

Building a trading bot used to mean renting rack space in New Jersey. Now a browser tab will do. Platforms such as TradeStation, QuantConnect and Interactive Brokers hand out APIs, historical data and cloud back‑testing for little or no upfront cost. A cottage industry of “no‑code” tools (some at $19 a month) lets non‑programmers click their way into automated strategies.

Behind the scenes, retail quants recycle open‑source libraries—from Python’s backtrader to reinforcement‑learning kits—once engineered for hedge funds. Many run on hobby GPUs or rented AWS instances that cost less than a streaming subscription. The result: algorithmic thinking has seeped into Reddit threads alongside memes and emojis.

The Simplicity Paradox

Yet amid the code and jargon, most small investors still crave simplicity: fewer tickers, fewer knobs, and clear explanations. Surveys by brokerage firms consistently rank “too many choices” as a main frustration. That gap between complexity and comprehension explains two parallel trends:
	•	Packaged algos. Some platforms now sell one‑click “strategies” that rebalance automatically, displaying a risk score instead of raw Greeks.
	•	Narrative dashboards. AI summarizers turn a swirl of technical stats into plain‑English blurbs: “Bearish momentum fading; next support at $120.” These are quant outputs wrapped in human language.

The business opportunity is obvious; so is the ethical obligation. Mis‑packaged leverage can mislead novices who may not understand that a 99‑cent 0‑DTE call can still lose 100 percent.

Where the Currents Converge

Put the pieces together and a picture emerges of a market that is broader, faster and more retail‑driven than at any time since ticker tape was invented. Here is what likely comes next:
	1.	Embedded Algo‑Advisors. Expect broker apps to offer tiered plans that slot users into canned quant models—think “Momentum Lite” or “Volatility Shield”—not unlike robo‑advisers but with intraday cadence.
	2.	Regulatory Guardrails. The SEC already floats rules on predictive data analytics used in customer‑facing apps. Future regulation may label certain types of option prompts as “investment recommendations,” imposing suitability tests once confined to human brokers.
	3.	Data Fees as the New Commission. Exchanges, smelling opportunity, are raising the price of real‑time data feeds. Zero commission did not kill friction; it merely moved it up the stack.
	4.	Community Quant Funds. Crowdsourcing sites may pool vetted retail algos into on‑chain “micro‑funds,” letting coders earn a cut of performance while small investors buy a slice without touching code.
	5.	Back‑to‑Basics Revival. Each burst of complexity tends to birth a “keep‑it‑simple” counter‑culture. Expect plain‑vanilla index funds to market themselves as the antidote to dopamine trading.

What It Means for Individual Investors

For veterans the message is nuanced: tools that once cost millions are now at your fingertips, but so is leverage that can vaporize a portfolio before lunch. A prudent roadmap:
	•	Know your latency. If your edge expires in milliseconds, you are competing with colocation behemoths. Better to seek slower signals—seasonality, earnings drift—where latency matters less.
	•	Stress‑test the bankroll. Simulate worst‑case drawdowns, not just average returns. A bot that triples money nine months a year and blows up in month 10 is still a grenade.
	•	Layer, don’t leap. Blend small allocations to algorithmic or option strategies with a core of low‑cost index funds. Complexity should sit on top of simplicity, not replace it.
	•	Read the fine print. Zero commissions say nothing about payment‑for‑order‑flow, option assignment fees, or margin interest. The cheapest trade can be the most expensive lesson.

The Long View

Markets reward innovation but punish complacency. Retail quants, technical chartists, option day‑traders and casual investors now share the same digital arena. The convergence will likely democratize sophisticated tactics while forcing platforms—and regulators—to translate Ph.D. math into middle‑school prose.

In the end the future looks neither purely robotic nor nostalgically human. It is hybrid: algorithms set the tempo, dashboards narrate the melody, and individual judgment decides when to hit “execute.” Kwon trading is here to stay, but the smartest investors will remain those who understand that every line of code—like every candlestick—casts both light and shadow.

I see so many people online talk about how they're banging new girls every week, or taking home girls from the club, or from HUB, or from coffee shops, dating apps, etc. as if they are all Leonardo DiCaprio from Titanic when in reality they're not, but I don't have any such luck. I guess in the beginning I had good luck with dating apps or language exchange apps and meeting people/hooking up, but hell, the last time I even slept with a new girl was in December, and she is an overweight Japanese girl (but really cool and great personality). 

Now don't get me wrong, I still have a few women that I meet sometimes and have sex with, but one is not really attractive and slightly chubby, and the other one is older than me by almost five years, but is slim and sex with her is great. And at one point, I had sex four times, with three different women, in two days, and one of them (older, 48, divorced with three kids, but still attractive) I had met the same day and she ended up staying overnight at my place. But frankly, that's not enough. I want to be hooking up with new women every week like what seems like most other guys here are doing. I've tried going to the club (mainly Warp since I live in Shinjuku), but have never once took a girl home from there or even made out with a girl in there. The most I've ever had is slightly dancing with a few girls before they leave and go somewhere else. But I've seen other guys (often tall and handsome, but even short, older, fat, brown, etc.) get lucky and I don't understand what my problem is. 

I know HUB is also supposed to be a good spot if you can speak Japanese (which I can), but I don't want to go there alone in hopes that someone talks to me, or that there aren't other foreigners more attractive or taller than me that I have to compete with, etc., so it just seems like it would be awkward. Plus I'm not much of a drinker, so one or two drinks is enough for me. 

I'm supposed to meet a girl from HelloTalk tomorrow (was supposed to be today, but I thought it was tomorrow, so she said we can change it to tomorrow) who is 29 I believe but has a boyfriend, or rather, she said they've become friends and I guess are not dating anymore, so maybe something will happen with that, but it's not a guarantee. And even if I do have plans to meet someone or match with someone on dating apps, they're usually 5-15 years older than me, or only a few years younger, and often times the conversation either never even starts, or stops at ""Hello"" or after a few messages. But I've seen so many guys here have cute girlfriends, even short guys, or fat guys, or hell, this one time I saw this olive-skinned bald guy with one of the most beautiful Japanese woman I've ever seen and couldn't believe it. Now to be fair, he was in a suit, so maybe he was rich or something, but still, I was extremely jealous at that moment. 

So men who have lots of success in Japan, what's your secret? I guess if anything, my age is the issue, which would make sense why I had more success in the beginning since I was under 40 at that time...",0,1745042226.0,thepassportbros,2,0.46,False

 I got this friend, we are the same age (36 F) and we are coworkers. We met 2 years ago and got along quite well since the beginning. I'm an introvert and she is the opposite but we complement each other. People kind of wonder how are we that close if we are very different in almost everything. I truly enjoy spending time together and I'm never tired of her. 

The first year we spent most of outlr time together as we shared the same schedule and days off. I tag along because I had just moved to the city and didn't have friends not family around and she brought me anywhere on her car. At first it was regular coffee dates, going to the cinema or going to the beach but later we start to do grocery shopping and tagging along medical schedules and appointments. It was kind of domestic and I feel comfortable with this routine, she said we got a connection and that she felt comfortable with me even if didn't speak so much. 

She told me I was like a sister to her and that I was also her best friend. Honestly I freak out a little because no one had told me that before and I felt overwhelmed with the importance of such a thing. I truly like her but I can't tell if she's my bff as I'm never been good hanging around girls. Most of my friends are men and the girlfriends I have were from school so it was more of a worry but she keep introducing me as a very good friend.

Last year she was transferred to another area and our schedules didn't match however that was no problem as we kept seeing each other at least twice a week. However after a while she started dating a guy from her area and we stop seeing each other, which truly disappointed me even though I knew it was going to happen because she is kinda pretty and honestly there aren't many single good-looking girls in our company so it was matter of time. 

Anyway, I was happy she was taking a chance about love as she had divorced and she felt ready for it but I got depressed as I couldn't spend time with her as we used to. It hurt even more when she started to share her dating life telling me she went to the same places and did the same things that we did and that from time to time she remembered me and scolded her bf for not be aware of certain stuff as I normally did (as an example, not ordering lactose free beverages). 

I admit I got jealous and during that time I was kind of obsessed about their relationship. I went to therapy as I knew I was getting mad about nothing. I mean, I know it is normal for people to hang out with friends and have a partner and socialize with people everyday. I didn't want her to be with me 24/7 or to only think of me or something like that but as she was so important to me at the time, I couldn't assimilate the idea and I felt as if she was choosing him over me, something that it's totally not the case as we are 2 very different kinds of relationships that nurture something different. I know that. 

There was a time were the 3 of us hanged out as she wanted for us to befriend, her idea was that that I could tag along their dates from time to time. I accepted because why not, I mean I didn't hate the guy, he seemed nice and she always told me he had some hobbies aligned with mine and we truly had many things in common which only made me more jealous of the whole situation as I thought why on earth she keep pointing out this guy was just like me ? I got upset so I tried to leave but she didn't let me go home alone and she gave me a ride. I got in the backseat and stare trough the window. The guy was sitting in front and they started chatting and whatever then she started to talk to him about me and she told him that she was worried about me and that I meant si much to her. The guy pointed out I was in the backseat though. She tried to dismiss the fact she forgot I was there saying she got distracted while driving.

Later on, she broke up with the guy and they remain as friends. She told me he was kind but boring and that she prefered spent time with that him. Honestly I still hang out with her but I don't enjoy it as before. Tonight we went to a bar along some other friends and when driving me home we were talking about how harsh is to get comfortable with new people or places as I'm very anxious. She told me something that makes me wonder how she sees me. She told me that when she is having a bad time she thinks of me, that I'm just besides her, not because I give her strength but because she thinks that under that situation I would be doing worse than her. She said that she repeats herself she needs to overcome the situation in behalf of us as the thinks we are having the same struggle at the same time. Honestly I don't know what to think about that comment. With everything I had mentioned, do you have any feedback? Particularly in the last comment please.

Saw other ppl comments wanting to know about getting rejuran, so sharing mine. Took the photo after few hours fr when I got rejuran. 

Pain scale = 8.5/10. Just imagine hundreds of needles poked into your skin. It hurts way more than botox imo. It's rapid little stabs 2 ur face. A nurse gave me a squismallow doll or sth so I can squeeze during shots, or else I might've punched the docs face lmao. 

Right after procedure = it's very typical to get embossing effect like mine. It goes away in 1-2 days or even hrs if u recover fast. Doc told me not to wear any makeup for one day. I didn't get bruising or bloating. 

After 2 weeks on getting rejuran, I noticed glow in skin. Not like an oily glow, it was more like healthy glow. And my base makeup actually went on nicely wo flaking or cakey even after hours. 
Rejuran lasted for about a month. The doc said if I get one every month for 3-4 times consistently, it can last even longer.

I did it 3 times in total. All from different clinics, but honestly didn't really feel any difference in effects. All of them probably used genuine Rejuran anyways. Legit clinic will give you certificate stickers and coupon you can use to trade for a free coffee or sth.

The appetite is more controlled, lower. You have way more energy. You lose lots weight. When you eat, you can almost immediately feel the food being moving through your GI tract and can eat a lot without gaining weight.

This initial boost in serotonin feels like a solid pill formed in the lower belly. Usually, one is highly synced with light in terms of the cicadian rhythms, and the pill feeling is the strongest in the morning as the sun starts to rise and rising.

It gives you the feeling of immortality. Lots and lots of qi. Because rapidly increased levels of serotonin also affect brain function, this practice, coupled with any medications that boost serotonin (and/or dopamine), energy drinks and pills, predisposition to schitzophrenia or bipolar etc., can also push someone into a hypomanic, manic, or a psychotic stage (commonly termed: insanity). That's why the Daoist manuals say this and similar practices must be practiced under the supervision of an in-person teacher and don't give out the details for self-practice.

The ultimate safety for this practice is the [fetal breathing/stillness](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDaoOfDaoDeJing/s/z5ZHI34TJY) practice. That's why stillness always comes first in all Daoist practices. If the mind can be quieted and truly still, no thoughts, no anxiety, no emotion (no elation, no depression), by definition, it will be sane, realistic, and can't be unstable by definition. Usually, a Daoist Master would not let a student even start the pill of immortality practice unless a student has reliably and verifiably learned stillness, and has done so consistently.

So the stillness/fetal breathing practice slows down the metabolism and decreases the energy, including the serotonin production and lowering the dopamine demand (probably decreasing the serotonin and dopamine receptor counts in the brain, which takes time, about 3 - 6 months usually), sometimes increasing hunger, while the pill of immortality practice speeds up the metabolism, and increases the energy.

As such, a Daoist Neidan Master can control and dial in their own biochemistry (body and brain biochemistry) quite well and intentionally.

The full cycle from getting started in stillness/fetal breathing etc. to the pill of immortality often takes about 9 months. The Daoist looks fat with a big gut as if pregnant eventually  (the Daoist body in the Ancient drawings) and more sluggish/duller (as a fatigued pregnant woman), followed by a rapid decrease in body weight, and higher energy, more active/sharper, much much slimmer, thinner, hotter.

That's why some people call the Daoist belly a ""qi baby"". And then you ""give birth"" to the ""qi baby"". And the head feeling, feels like qi is exiting at the top of the head (baihui spot).

This is generally speaking, as successful stillness meditation is very safe at all times. One would have to intentionally practice it to lower the metabolism. Stillness/no desire meditation can also be practiced to listen to the body, dial in the right nutrition by paying attention to which foods decrease cravings more than others and promote entering stillness easier (so even men can feel strong food cravings like a pregnant woman). In this case stillness meditation serves as a control and a baseline, to make sure cravings don't arise from other desires like sex, social interaction, withdrawal from habits like video games, news, smoking, coffee, drinking, favorite soap operas, etc. etc.

Of course, this is the wide spectrum of the practice, and a Daoist Master will often dial in their body chemistry just right long-term for daily life based on the immediate environment, required activity levels, seasons, food availability, and daily interactions with others.",1,1745041968.0,TheDaoOfDaoDeJing,0,1.0,False

You know, writing, possibly directing, and create my own show. So I need to make a plan starting now.

For reference; I had an internship in a magazine company for the entire school year. Wrote articles, mostly about entertainment because those are my interests. I also follow errands what my boss asked me to do, like coffee, go to events that are news worthy so I could take pictures and write about it. I'm also a writer myself, not for TV, but short stories, flash fictions, something like that.

I know big TV companies often prefers employees with bigger experiences so that's what I’m gonna do while I'm still here in the Philippines. Gaining experience. The reason I want to work in America is because I much prefer English writing rather than my own mother tongue. Plus, I love sitcoms, but the Philippines isn't very famous making them. We barely have sitcoms.

I love America's way in screenwriting, that's why I want to work there. If anything, if I ever get lucky, it's a dream of mine to work for Seth McFarlane in his shows.

What tips would you guys give me to get me a head start.

Hunter’s POV

The fluorescent lights in Yura University’s library hum like a distant swarm, casting a sterile glow over the stacks of books I’ve buried myself in. I’m tucked in a corner carrel, my hoodie pulled up, a dog-eared copy of The Handmaid’s Tale open in front of me. The words blur, not because I’m tired, but because my mind’s wandering again, back to places I’d rather forget. I scribble a note in the margin, more to anchor myself than to study. The library’s my sanctuary, a place where no one notices me, and I like it that way. Crowds make my skin itch, voices too loud, eyes too sharp. Here, it’s just me and the stories, worlds where I can hide without being seen.

I wasn’t always this quiet. Back in high school, in a suburban nowhere town, I was different—brighter, maybe. I had friends, a laugh that carried, a knack for painting murals that got me noticed. My mom used to call me her little spark, framing my sloppy watercolors like they were masterpieces. 

But then Dad left, and Mom’s new boyfriend moved in. He was all charm at first, but his hands wandered when she wasn’t looking. I was sixteen, too scared to tell her, too small to fight back. I started shrinking, fading into hoodies and silence, painting less, smiling less. School became a gauntlet—mean girls like Ana, with their perfect nails and sharper tongues, sniffed out my weakness. “What’s wrong, Hunter? Daddy issues?” they’d taunt, their laughter like glass in my lungs. I learned to be invisible, to slip through cracks, to keep my heart locked tight.

When I got accepted to Yura, it was a lifeline. A new city, a fresh start. Mom cried when I left, but I could tell she was relieved—less guilt for not noticing what her boyfriend did. I promised myself I’d be okay here, maybe even find the old Hunter, the one who laughed without looking over her shoulder. But college isn’t that simple. 

The campus is beautiful, all ivy and skyline, but it’s loud—parties, cliques, rumors. And now this slasher, cutting through kids like a shadow. I read about the psych student in the park, the smiley face mask left like a sick signature. It’s terrifying, but part of me—the part that’s been running since I was sixteen—feels like I’ve been dodging monsters my whole life.

I try to focus on my book, but my phone buzzes, jarring me. It’s a group chat I got dragged into for a class project, mostly Olivia from that Glitch Club crew and some others. I don’t talk much, but Olivia’s nice, always smiling when she sees me. The message isn’t from her, though—it’s a screenshot from an unknown number, forwarded by one of Ana’s minions. The text reads: Olivia, hope the killer gets u next. Ur little club won’t save u. My stomach twists. It’s signed with a smiley emoji, too close to the mask for coincidence. I can picture Ana and her pack cackling in some dorm, their glossy lips curled. Olivia hasn’t replied, but I know it’s got to hurt. I want to text her, say something kind, but my fingers freeze. What if they turn on me next? I shove my phone in my pocket, hating how small I feel.

I pack up, needing air, and head toward the humanities building for my next class. The hallways are a blur of chatter and sneakers, everyone moving in packs like they’re afraid to be alone. I keep my head down, my book clutched like a shield. I’m almost to the stairwell when I collide with someone, my novel hitting the floor with a thud. “Oh, crap, I’m so sorry!” a voice says, warm and flustered. I look up, and it’s a girl with glasses and a messy bun, her flannel sleeves rolled up. She’s already kneeling, grabbing my book before I can. “Hunter, right? I’m Fern.” Her smile is soft, no judgment, just this quiet kindness that catches me off guard.

As she walks away, I clutch my book tighter, her warmth lingering. For the first time in forever, I wonder if I could belong somewhere.

1k2p5qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonduality/comments/1k2p5qt/youll_never_be_enlightened/,you'll never be enlightened.,"if you would have told me ten years ago i'd be laying in bed writing about enlightenment, i would've remarked at how cliché this opening is.

told this story so many times. meditating in my apartment one afternoon as the sun was setting, nothing serious. only listening. cars passing by outside. neighborhood kids playing. birds chirping.

thoughts slowed down until they were coming up one by one. then a final thought came: being born. it popped out of view like a bubble.

suddenly there was the realization that i had never been born. always as i am, clear awareness.

attention flipped in an instant from looking out at a world of things to looking for a looker and couldn't find one. i stood up, laughing. then, wanted to run out in the street.

i write all this knowing it'll cause some conflict in your thinking. words do this when it comes to clarity. they get in the way. and a story like this creates expectation more than reflection.

because you'd want to figure out, ""what does he mean by clear awareness?"" or, ""i didn't have that experience, what does it mean?"" or, ""i did have something similar, what does it mean?""

this is one of the reasons i typically avoid stories which highlight fringe experience. i feel the tension. whenever folks hold on, i feel it.

see, we always talk the oneness thing, but very rarely it seems are folks open to the actual possibility that there really is only one of us.

because the ordinary is where most of us spend our time, which by its nature, gives in to the plethora of individuality and separation. it's natural. that's the way of things.

obviously, because that's the way they are, and it's this simple. 

sometimes i come out though like now and put together some words. didn't even know it would go in this direction. somebody said last night, ""if the coffee and bagel hits write a post."" forgot about that until brushing my teeth. now this.

so what is this exactly? who is this?

these are questions only you can answer for yourself. sorry to be cryptic, but it's true.

there are so many personalities (both old and new) telling you what and who anything is. especially online.

you won't find enlightenment on the internet. you won't find it in a book. you won't even find it in a practice, as much as the seeking fanfare seems to suggest so.

you won't ever find it.

it doesn't exist in anyway that you'll be able to grab and possess for yourself. you won't ever be able to wear it as a badge. not the real thing.

and this isn't to gatekeep it by the way. or maybe it is. idk, you decide what it means for you, right now, without thinking about it. because this is it.

whatever it is. it's this. and this isn't something you can hold. you can only be it, but not as an intention. it ""be's you,"" in other words.

this makes no sense whatsoever. it can't. if it does, you're fitting this into a model of what you think it may be, and as long as you're holding onto a model of it, it isn't it. 

(even a model of no-model, as some of my friends protest against huehue.)

anyway. hopefully the person who wanted this nonsense sees it. i delete everything eventually. this post is no exception.",3,1745040892.0,nonduality,7,0.8,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/s/lnYDNSIijP

Summary of previous post:

I’m three weeks into a new job as a receptionist at a skincare clinic. Most of my team—my coworker, the managers, and two of the nurses—have been kind and supportive. But one nurse, Jocelyn, has made things really difficult for me. She was friendly at first, but after a few small mistakes (typical for someone new), she started making passive-aggressive, condescending remarks—always when no one else is around.

She criticizes me over little things like how I close doors or use the coffee machine, and it’s not constructive—it feels belittling. Most recently, during my first solo closing shift, she refused to show me how to disarm the alarm, mocked me for not knowing, and then clearly didn’t know how to use it herself. I ended up juggling my stuff and the trash alone while she stood by unhelpfully.

I finally opened up to the assistant manager about how hard Jocelyn made that night, but she just said Jocelyn is usually the nicest person and maybe it was an off day. But this isn’t new—it’s been a pattern since my first week, and it’s getting harder to ignore.

Update:

She’s still been rude but I’ve learned to tune her out. It’s not unbearable but it’s irritating to say the least. I did catch myself badmouthing her once then remembered to never do that again. I confided in a coworker that she makes me uncomfortable and she brushed it off so I never brought it up again.

Jocelyn got a new job. Unfortunately she’s still with us but she will begin a new job that’s on call. Essentially she’s still with us but if the corporate office needs a nurse to demo new skincare technology/add ons, she will go then train the new staff on it. 

My manager had to give the final yes. She wanted to congratulate Jocelyn with the news with flowers and a cake - no issue right?

 The issue is I had a new patient consultation (it’s 15-20 minutes undivided attention as I have them fill out medical forms) and the sale. I had two other patients in the treatment rooms and people checking in and out. I had to get up from my consultation 2-4 times since my manager, my assistant manager, and fellow receptionist “had to run to the grocery store) which is about a 5 minute walk away.

I carried on and see the 3 return while I’m mid conversation with flowers and a cake. I had no idea why they went and what it was for since I was kept out of the loops.

I’m checking out patients and I hear cheering in the break room and laughter. Again - I had no idea what was going on. I kept thinking to myself if it was someone’s birthday.

After 20 minutes of everyone being gone and celebrating something, the other receptionist comes out who’s Jocelyn’s bff. 

“Sorry we left. We went to get cake and flowers for Jocelyn - she got the new position!”

My manager and assistant manager comes back out and said “sorry you were left out but we tried to do it so quick. We just wanted to give Jocelyn some flowers.”

Like an idiot I kept saying “it’s okay, it’s okay it’s okay” when instead I should’ve said something. I kick myself now for not speaking up.

When me and the receptionist were alone, I finally said 

“It was pretty annoying that you guys left while we had a new patient and three people here.”

She laughed it off.

I feel like a total moron. ",2,1745040538.0,coworkerstories,2,1.0,False

Tried posting on r/Vent but they keep deleting my shit cause i don’t have enough karma or whatever. I don't know how to start this so l'll just start talking.

I have this constant feeling of there being so many things wrong with me. I don't think i've been truly happy, except for the fleeting happy laughs here and there, in years. I have no idea if there's actually anything wrong with me, I usually just convince myself that I'm fine and that I'm just blowing everything way out of proportion because I want attention and that I want to feel special and that I'm only doing it so my wallowing in self-pity might actually be justified.

I've been told by multiple people they think that I should really see a therapist, and I told them that I would, but I never have and I don't think I ever will.

I don't even like most of the people I talk with on a daily basis at school. I used to try to find connection by flirting with people online, but it got pretty bad and I had to stop because once i realized I was just coping with my loneliness I couldn't find any comfort in it any more. Even the friends I actually do like don't understand me at all. It's mostly, probably entirely, my fault because I can't open up to them. I think it's because I don't think they would understand even if I did tell them, and I don't want it to change the way they see me.

The only time I ever kinda act like the person I want to be is after drinking a couple Monsters, and even then I also feel more irritable and jittery than usual, which I didn't think was possible until now.

I've never really had any coffee or caffeine regularly so l don't really have any tolerance.
I hate my body, l've hated it for years. I can't stand to look in mirrors without clothes on, and I have to turn the lights off when I brush my teeth and do my hair. My personal hygiene is inconsistent at best, and I only get a shower once every four to six days. I feel disgusting a lot of the time, but I just have absolutely no will to do those kinds of things. I used to work out regularly, and I was making really good progress, but making progress just demotivated me for some fucking reason and now I haven't gone like two weeks. I'm not morbidly obese or anything, but I'm 6'3 285 lbs. I think I wear 285 lbs as good as a human can, which isn't too well. I play sports and whatnot and I'm reasonably athletic but I don't really look it.

I do fine in school, I always have, and I'm going to a good university. I actually got into my dream uni, which I guess I should be happy about, but I'm really not excited at all. I don't think I deserve it for so many reasons, I thought I would feel validated by some admissions committee saying I deserve to go to this school but I just feel like I took my friend's place, who didn't get in to the same school and is devastated. He deserved it more than l ever will, and he cares so much more than me about everything and he actually might do something with his life.

l've never been in a romantic relationship. I have been asked out a couple times, but once was in middle school and once was by a person I barely knew at all who said they loved me less then 48 hours in and I had to ghost. I was rejected by the only girl I've ever asked out. She said she didn't know me well enough to go to prom with her, which is absolutely fair. I don't even know her last name, and I barely see her at school, and I only see her once a week at a school club we're both in. I was going to ask our a girl in one of my classes, but one of my friends was told by one of her friends that she wouldn't date me because I wasn't hot enough. I know most of yall read that sentence and think how superficial I am for caring about that but I already hate myself so much and it hurt so bad.

I don't think I really even liked either of the two girls. I just wanted to prove to myself and other people that I could get a girl if I wanted. Turns out, I can't.

Most nights I end up laying in bed listening to
ASMR girlfriend role plays until 1 or 2 am because I'm so fucking lonely. I know it's pathetic. I can probably fall asleep without them but mentally I need something to fill that massive chasm in my soul.

I cannot stand getting complimented or praised, mostly because of how my parents raised me, but sometimes those audios can say things that make me feel like maybe I'm not totally fucked, at least for a second or two before I realize.
I think about killing myself every day, the only reason I haven't is because I feel like I have an obligation to go to my college after taking my friends spot and on the slim chance something good happens. I didn't realize this before, but if I didn't get into this college, I probably wouldn't here to be write this. I guess that seems contrary to what I was just saying. I don't know.
No use contemplating what could've happened.

I just feel like a corpse being dragged through life, my charred lifeless body disintegrating and leaving a trail of black ash as I am dragged through the ground on a noose tied by my own hands.

I'm sorry for the dramatic language and  how disorganized this post was, and I guess thanks for sticking around until the end. I don't know why I posted this, I guess I just needed to say some of this. There's a lot more I can talk about, a LOT actually, but I'll spare those of you who actually care enough to read this.

I’ll write several scenes that are long enough they each take up their own chapter… but in the end it turns out all these events take place over the course of a single day. Then that throws me off the rest of the work because *shit what if I do that again?* and *how is it going to look when I spend one chapter on just one day later on?* and then I never finish the rest of it.

In one work I took 6 chapters for the main character to say “and that’s how I spent my first day in my mother’s hometown!” (in this case it can *probably*? be forgiven because the framing device is her telling her child the weirdass summer she had when she was 16 over a long period of time, and each part stops when significant interruptions happen, like her father coming home for dinner or it being the kid’s bedtime, but still).

There was another time I noticed I did nearly the same thing and decided to just *make it a thing*. Monday, which had the most happening, had 7 chapters; Tuesday’s going to have 6; then Wednesday 5; Thursday 4; Friday 3; Saturday 2; and Sunday the very last… which was where I intended to end it anyway, so it worked out.

The rest of the time, it’s completely unintentional and I hate it.

In my current WIP, it goes something like this:

- Chapter 1 is named after the POV character and gives us a glimpse into his life, how the highlight of his day is spending the morning with his mother, and that’s pretty much it. There’s only so much a guy can do in half an hour. Wakes up, drinks coffee, gets the gossip from his mom, does his one chore. After putting out the trash, he almost runs into a morning jogger, whose eyes he avoids because he’s a misanthrope.

- Chapter 2 is named after and introduces the deurteragonist, aka the morning jogger, who shows up in his class and he’s like *fuuuuckkkk* because he promised his mom he’d be nice to the new kid, *and she’s the new kid*. So he says hi and then just reads the whole hour. But then she leaves the room with her stuff so he thinks she’s gone for good, which lets him focus on…

- Chapter 3: that teacher he has a crush on, who suggested the book he’s reading! Ooooh! But also the new girl comes back (oh no!) because it turns out she just went to the bathroom.

And so on.

Anyone got any tips to **not** do what the hell I’m doing?",1,1745040005.0,FanFiction,1,1.0,False

Also I'm from Australia so if any prices mentioned seem egregious and unacceptable, that's because they are. 

So I would like to hear people's opinions on this because I've had this convo with friends and coworkers and some agree while others say I'm rationalising people's inability to budget. 

I think that people are getting priced out of their hobbies, particularly gaming and crafts from my own experiences. I'm an mtg player and I've noticed prices raising pretty steadily over the last 2 years. There's lots of reasons for this but I think it hinders people getting into the game. The same goes for gaming. A digital PS5 slim here is ~$680, with most AAA games averaging $90-$120 (depending on time of year and whatnot). Even a disk drive and physical games don't help much. 

Board games too! I went to see if there was a few board games/card games for a friend's birthday and the games were damn near $40 and more! I feel like that's a lot for some people, especially kids trying to get into new things. 

Maybe I'm a boomer here (I'm 26 with aching joints and a love of jazz) but I think it's sucks for younger people trying to explore new things and get into new hobbies. 

What are yalls thoughts on this? Do you think hobbies are getting more and more expensive? If so, are there alternatives? What did you have for lunch today? And lastly, are you a tea or a coffee person, or a hot chocolate person? 

Have a great day. Take care of yourself. You matter. And always remember that the world is a better place with you in it ❤️",55,1745039983.0,CasualConversation,29,0.98,False

# Best Marble Coffee Tables: Find Yoru⁢ Dream 2025 Table

Selecting ‍the perfect coffee table is essential for tying together your living space. ‍A marble coffee table provides a touch of elegance and sophistication, serving as both⁤ a ‌functional piece of furniture and ⁢a stylish statement. With numerous‍ options ‍available, ‌choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. This‍ guide will explore‌ some of the best marble coffee tables you can expect to see trending‍ in 2025, helping ‍you find​ the ideal centerpiece for your home.

[[Explore Top Rated marble coffee table on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/home-thinking/?kw=marble coffee table)

## Key Features Analysis

The appeal of a‌ marble coffee table lies in its‌ timeless​ aesthetic⁣ and durable construction. When ‍evaluating ‌different models, several​ key features deserve careful consideration.

**Marble Type:** The type ⁢of marble used profoundly impacts the table's appearance, durability, and price.

Carrara marble, ‍known for its white‍ background and subtle gray veining, offers ‍a classic and versatile look. Calacatta marble, distinguished by its bolder, dramatic ⁣veining on a white ⁤base, provides a more luxurious and statement-making option. Other variations include Nero Marquina (black⁣ with ⁤white veins) and emperador (brown with lighter ⁢veins), ‌each offering a unique ⁤aesthetic.The marble's origin and grading also ​affect its quality and price.

**Table Dimensions:** ⁣Accurate measurements are ⁤crucial​ to ⁤ensure ​the table fits comfortably within your​ living room layout.

Consider the available space ‌and the table's intended function. A larger table ​is ideal⁣ for entertaining or displaying decorative items, while‍ a smaller table might be more suitable for compact⁢ spaces.Pay attention to both the table's length and width, and also its height, ensuring it⁢ complements your sofas and chairs.Generally, the ⁤coffee table should be about the same height ‍as your ​sofa cushions or slightly ‌lower.

**Base Material and Design:** The coffee table base influences its overall style and stability.

Metal​ bases, frequently ‌enough crafted from ​stainless ​steel or‌ wrought iron, provide a modern or industrial aesthetic. Wooden bases,constructed from solid ⁣wood or engineered wood,offer a ⁢warmer,more ⁤traditional⁣ feel.‌ The​ base design can range from simple geometric shapes to intricate, sculptural​ forms. Consider the weight ⁣capacity of the base ‌to ensure it can adequately ‍support ‍the marble ‌top.

**Shape and Edge Profile:** The shape ‍of a marble coffee table influences its visual impact ⁢and functionality.

Round or oval tables ‌promote easy traffic flow and are ideal for smaller spaces or rooms ​with curved furniture. Rectangular tables offer ample surface⁤ area ‍and are well-suited⁣ for ‌larger living rooms with sofas ⁤arranged ⁢along one wall. Square⁤ tables provide a contemporary, balanced​ look. The edge profile, whether it's beveled, rounded, or straight, ⁤also ​contributes to the ‌table's⁢ overall aesthetic. A beveled edge adds ⁤a touch ​of sophistication, while a​ rounded edge​ provides a softer, more inviting appeal.

**Finish ⁢and Protection:** The marble's finish ⁣and any protective coatings impact its maintenance and ‌longevity.

A polished finish enhances the marble's natural shine and veining but ‌can⁣ be more susceptible to scratches and stains. A honed finish provides a‌ matte surface that is more ⁣resistant to imperfections but may require more frequent sealing. Consider a protective coating or‍ sealant to prevent stains from spills or acidic substances.‌ Regular⁢ cleaning with a pH-neutral cleaner is⁤ also essential to maintain the marble's beauty.

Fern’s POV

Morning light sneaks through my dorm blinds, painting stripes across my biology notes. Last night’s weed haze lingers in my head, but I’m up early, sipping coffee, my lo-fi playlist on low. Yura University’s campus hums outside—students rushing to class, leaves skittering across the quad. I shove my glasses up and grab my backpack, trying to shake the unease from that party rumor. A dead freshman. It’s messed up, but campus feels normal, like it’s just another day.

In the lecture hall, Vada’s doodling in her notebook, smirking when I slide in next to her. “You hear about Delta House?” she whispers. I nod, stomach twisting. “Cops think it’s random,” she says, but her eyes flick to the door, like she’s not so sure. Olivia’s late, as usual, slipping in with a grin and a half-eaten bagel. We’re just college kids, cramming for midterms, but that slasher story clings like damp air.

At lunch, the Glitch Club claims our usual table in the cafeteria. Bella’s telling some story, her laugh bright, while Aspen’s got his arm around her, all heart-eyes. They’re stupid cute, whispering sweet nothings over fries. Then Ana struts by, her designer bag swinging. “Fern, still rocking thrift store chic?” she snipes. I roll my eyes, but it stings. Bella’s on her feet in a second. “Ana, go be bitter somewhere else.” Ana huffs, muttering, “Whatever, Bella. Glitch Club’s a joke.” Vada snorts, “Jealous much?” Ana glares but stalks off, her clique trailing.

Later, I spot Hunter in the library, tucked in a corner with a book. “Hey,” I say, and her face lights up, shy but warm. We chat about classes, her voice soft but earnest. She’s different—genuine, like she sees me. I invite her to grab coffee sometime, and she nods, blushing.

Back in my room, my phone buzzes. Vada again: Party at Aspen’s tonight. You down? I hesitate. Another party, after what happened? But it’s Aspen’s place, suburban, safe. I text back, I’m in. The city sparkles outside, all neon and promise, but that smiley face mask flashes in my mind, sharp as a blade.",1,1745039554.0,SkullyBoy,0,1.0,False

Fern’s POV

The soft hum of lo-fi beats spills from my earbuds, wrapping my dorm room at Yura University in a cocoon of calm. I’m sprawled on my bed, glasses sliding down my nose, a biology textbook open but ignored. Fairy lights twinkle above, casting a warm glow over my cluttered desk. It’s just another Thursday, and I’m savoring the quiet.

My phone buzzes. Vada’s text lights up the screen: Yo, Glitch Club sesh at Neon Café. You in? I smirk. Vada’s the spark to my chill. I type back, Bet. Gimme 20. I swap my hoodie for a flannel, grab my bag, and head out, the city’s skyline glittering beyond campus.
Neon Café’s our hideout, a dive with flickering signs and mismatched chairs. Vada’s already there, braids swinging as she waves me over. Olivia’s sketching in her notebook, and Bella’s laughing, her arm around Aspen. He’s only here ‘cause of her, but he’s cool enough, sneaking Bella a kiss that makes her giggle. It’s cozy, normal—our little crew just vibing over coffee and dumb jokes.

Later, we pile into my room, passing a joint as Vada rambles about some party. The weed hazes everything soft, our laughter echoing. Across campus, I hear there was a party at Delta House. Some kid, a freshman, didn’t make it home. Cops found him in the park, slashed up, a smiley face mask left nearby. Freaky, but it feels distant, like it can’t touch us.

Earlier, in the hall, I bumped into Hunter, this shy girl with a sweet smile. She dropped her books, and I helped her up, both of us laughing nervously. She’s quiet, like she’s hiding from the world, but her kindness stuck with me. Unlike Ana, who cornered me at lunch, sneering about my “nerd vibes.” Bella snapped, “Lay off, Ana.” Ana scoffed, “Why do you even hang with her?” Bella grinned, “’Cause she’s real. Jealous you didn’t make the Club?” Ana stormed off, and I felt a little taller.
Life’s good, mostly. But that party rumor nags at me, a shadow in the calm.",1,1745039358.0,SkullyBoy,0,1.0,False

**AITAH For breaking my Number 1 sex rule with a handicapped guy?**


So TL/DR for the “give me the bare bones, I don’t have all day to read on the shitter” crew: My #1 sex rule since high school has been no sex before the third date. I recently broke that rule with a handicapped guy, and now my childhood best friend is pissed and grossed out because she thinks I have some weird kind of fetish.

Context/full story: I’m a 28f. My childhood best friend we’ll call Jess is also 28f. To put it simply, I don’t think I’m any kind of prude, I just don’t really feel comfortable with casual sex, never have. My best friend knows this and has teased me about it lightly in the past. She’s been in a long term relationship for the last 3 years, I’ve mostly been single while working on my degree and starting my career. Jess lives in another state with her boyfriend, so we don’t hang out much anymore.

So about a month ago I had a first date with a guy I’d been talking to for a bit, thought it was going places, but he gave a WEIRD vibe on the date and I cut and ran early. On my way home I stopped at a local pub, figured I’d have a drink to unwind and people watch till it wore off. (Tipsy driving is still drunk driving IMO.) I get there and it’s pretty packed, Friday night and all, and there was no seating room at the bar. Took my drink and looked around, most of the “restaurant” side of the pub was someone’s birthday party, but there was a small table with a seat open off to the side, with a guy reading a book there. So I say eff it, I’m a social person and what’s the worst thing that happens, he says no? So I ask if I can sit there for a bit, I promise we don’t have to talk or anything.

At this point I feel like I’ve fucked up because this guy up close is the hottest man I have ever seen. But he just smiled at me and gave an enthusiastic “Sure!” A few minutes later of me sipping in silence and he says “I don’t mind talking, if you want to.” (Yeah I want to are you kidding me right now?) We talk for a bit and it turns out Mike (fake name) is 29, just finished his master’s degree in some kind of computer learning field (“I program computers to program computers”) and he’s living on his own for the first time. He apparently stops by the pub after work because he’s right around the corner, and he’s not used to the silence yet after living so long with a half dozen siblings.

We talked for a good two hours, about everything from dating (which he said he’s basically given up on) to hobbies and tastes, and we have a near total eclipse of a venn diagram on this stuff. I eventually sort of blurted out that I don’t know why he’d give up on dating, this is the closest thing I’ve had to a good date in forever. (Shooting my shot obliquely here lol.) He gets kind of an odd look on his face and says “Tell you what, I have to go to the bathroom, but when I come back I’ll ask you out for real.” Weird, but okay?

Then it all clicks, because he doesn’t get up to walk away, he just rolls. In his wheelchair. And I’m thinking “oh my God he wanted to give me a chance to back out of this without making it awkward how cute can this guy BE.” He grinned like crazy when he got back and saw I was still there, and I basically tripped over myself saying something to the effect of “So I’m free all weekend, what did you have in mind?”

Another hour later, we’ve got plans for Saturday, and he told me he has a neuromuscular disorder I can’t remember the name of (my degree isn’t in STEM lol) so his legs work, but the signals from his brain get misinterpreted so he doesn’t have the balance or coordination for walking or standing. The pub starts switching over to the younger/rowdier crowd and he asks if I’d like to go back to his place for coffee to continue our conversation.

As you have probably long since realized, I did not get any coffee or conversation till the next morning and I have ZERO regrets. We’ve been dating since and I know it’s still early but I really feel like this might be the one.

Onward to yesterday afternoon, my friend Jess (remember Jess?) is in town, and we go out for coffee to catch up on things. I’m gushing about Mike, but when I get to how we met she just sort of got weird and edgy. I don’t remember any exact words but she essentially said that I must have a fetish for the handicapped since I broke my #1 rule and it’s the best physical relationship I’ve ever been in. Like it’s good for me because he uses a wheelchair, not because the guy puts in effort in bed??? She said I’ve “changed” as a person and left without even saying goodbye. 15 years of friendship and I’ve never seen her like that.

So here I am, asking the most objective people online (haha) if I’m an asshole or weird for being super attracted to a guy who uses a wheelchair and basically putting out immediately.


**Update - 2 days later**

My first ever update! Yay! Uh, so if you were hoping for some terrible drama, I hate to break it to you that I don’t roll like that. No pun intended. So I do have an update on Jess and shit finally makes perfect sense. And I have a slightly NSFW but funny story about Mike, because this guy is just the best, y’all.

Okay, so first, I finally messaged Jess yesterday and said basically “I’m still hurt by what you said, but after 15 years of friendship I’d never forgive musif I didn’t at least ask why you snapped at me like that.” She replied immediately, “I’m so fucking sorry, I didn’t mean any of that, can we have a do over on lunch?” So I agreed cautiously and took a half day to meet with her today.

Turns out that those of you who said she was jealous, and that she might have something else going on, and especially the person who said something might be going on in HER relationship….. gold stars. She’s in town because she’s job hunting, because she’s moving back in with her parents for a while since her relationship ended. Apparently they have been having a ton of small problems adding up, but the biggest one? Sex. The guy she’s been with was apparently never great but it’s gotten to the point where he makes no effort at all for her to enjoy herself and then gets pissed when she isn’t in the mood.

She tried talking with him about it, making suggestions but he told her recently that it’s “emasculating” being given sex advice by a woman. The straw that broke the metaphorical camel’s back, however, was that her boyfriend has always had a thing for Asian women. She’s caucasian, but she does have long black hair. After weeks of fighting over their sex life, he suggested that they spice things up….by her dressing in a kimono and pretending to be Asian. She lost it on him and is absolutely disgusted by the racist fetishism and ended it right then.

So she had allllll of this bottled up and was hoping to talk to me and finally be able to put it down….. and I missed every hint that she had something big to discuss because I was gushing about Mike. So to her it felt like I was just twisting the knife by bragging about how great our sex was. She snapped, and somewhere between what I was saying and what she wanted to talk about some wires got crossed and she said something incredibly dumb.

She left without saying goodbye because she was mortified and ashamed as well as irrationally mad at me. Something to know about Jess, she’s an awful liar and she and I were the co-founders of our high school’s “foot-in-mouth” society, so I do believe her. I told her I forgive her and I’m sorry I didn’t realize she wanted to talk about something bothering her, and she said I was too stupidly nice and have nothing to apologize for, so I think we’ll be okay. For the time being I’m not ready for her and Mike to meet, because I don’t want to make things feel worse, and she agrees. But she’s really really happy for me. Hopefully this is just a funny story we can look back on someday.

So, on to how Mike almost killed me, lol. Last night we were talking about the reddit post and he gets this funny expression that I’m starting to recognize. And he goes “How do we know you don’t have a fetish if we haven’t at least tried it in the chair?” And I’m like “are you serious lol”. He said he’s never attempted it, because (cue tears) he’s never felt so comfortable with a partner before. Well.

His chair has what is essentially like a parking break thing. Or it should, it’s unfortunately broken and apparently getting them fixed is an expensive pain in the ass. He doesn’t use it that often so he hasn’t made it a priority. And there’s this thing called Newton’s third law, you know how every action has an equal and opposite reaction? As it happens, when you’re trying to, ah, get the motion of the ocean going, in a chair with wheels that aren’t locked, there’s a sort of counter motion that starts and fucks it all up. So we were going nowhere fast except for inching along the floor in his bedroom. And laughing at the silliness, which isn’t helping. Eventually he just stops and says “Maybe we can get some of those wooden block things they use to keep little planes from rolling away, like in Indiana Jones you know?”

I absolutely lost it. Like laughing so hard I’m in tears, he’s giggling half at the situation and half at my reaction, and everything just keeps setting me off again. FINALLY I get it under control, doing some deep breathing exercises and shit, and I look at him again. And he pulls the straightest face he can, and says, for the love of god, “Golly. This sure is uncomfortable.” Folks if I had asthma I would have fucking died right there. I laughed so hard I think I pulled a rib. Like wheezing and not even laughing anymore so much as weeping and making this awful “heeeeee” noise when I could catch my breath. While he’s laughing and rubbing my back and saying he’s sorry, he couldn’t resist.

So yeah, confirmed, no fetish here, and this magnificent bastard’s comedic timing might actually kill me.


**Update - 1 month later**


So first up, you know what people (at least me) don’t think about when dating a guy who’s always sitting? Height. I know he’s taller than me because we cuddle a lot, and he’s taller sitting on the couch, but I didn’t reeeeeeally get it. So we drive up Friday night after work (actually south and west, lol, but to my brain it’s always up) in his vehicle, which is modified to be driven entirely using his hands. Neat, right? He’s a really good driver too. One more green flag. We get to the house, and it’s…. It’s huge you guys, LOL like not a mansion, just kind of a sprawling one floor rancher. Real estate was wild back in the day.

Anyway we get out, and I meet his mom. I’d like to point out I am no slouch, I’m 5’-friggin-7. His mom is TOWERING over me. But she was the nicest lady ever. We go inside and I meet his dad (who funny enough is apparently the only short one in this family) and his youngest sister, who is living there with his one year old niece. She gets up to hug me and SHE IS ALSO REALLY TALL. It’s already a bit late then, so we eat and head to bed, I get to see his cute as shit room from when he was a teenager, and I casually ask “hey, so uh, I don’t know how this works and stuff, but how tall are you?” and Mike is all “I dunno, like a bit over 6’4? Been a while since I checked.” A BIT OVER 6’4. “So, is everyone in your family tall?” “…..kinda?”

We met the Nordic Basketball team he calls a family properly the next day. (Actually they’re Irish, but they’re blond and tall so it conveys the idea better.) The ONLY one of reasonable height, and still taller than me, was his oldest sister, lol.

They are also LOUD. Like not really shouting or anything usually, just, PRESENT. Mike is a lot different around them, but in the cutest way, like he just beams all the time and you can see how happy he is to be home. One of his brothers put him in a headlock and gave him a dang NOOGIE as a greeting, and got elbowed in the side for it, and all of them laughing. And his mom smacked one of his brothers with a rolled up magazine for putting his feet on the table. More laughing. Just… intimidating but in the happiest way imaginable. I’ll admit I was a little shut down for a bit, but Mike kept checking in with me to make sure I was okay, and they were all really nice, so I got into the spirit after a bit.

I mentioned this in another comment, but Mike has a special sports wheelchair he uses for, well, sports. And he and his siblings play basketball. And he is GOOD. Apart from just having a hell of an arm, he’s quick as hell. And this magnificent bastard that I love will absolutely, purposefully, GLEEFULLY run someone’s toes over. He AIMS for it. They all have this yank-back-the-foot maneuver that’s hysterical to watch.

So it was this crazy day of loud people playing and having a blast, nieces and nephews running around, and just noise. My ears are still ringing. The food was catered in advance because his mom “had seven babies, all I make on mother’s day is margaritas.” They also have a pool, it’s a bit chilly still but the pool is HEATED so we actually all got to swim, which was a lot of fun because I got to show off that I too am athletic…. I can do a backwards somersault off a diving board! Yeah. I’m a real catch lol. They at least pretended to be impressed.

We all stayed up late drinking and bitching that it was too overcast to see the aurora (boo) and I had the worst hangover I’ve had in a while on Sunday. We slept in a bit late, and then joined Mike’s family for the BBQ part of the BBQ weekend. His dad can GRILL, people. And he’s fast, food coming off the grill at lightning speed. I asked Mike about it and he laughed and said “there was seven of us to feed. Ever see a nest of baby birds? He had practice.” Which, fair enough.

I don’t have much experience with babies, but I got to hold his youngest niece (the one living at home with his sis until her husband gets back from deployment) and we had a light talk about kids in the future. I told him that I never put much thought into it but if they were going to grow up in a happy home like his and not how I grew up, I’m pretty sure I’d be open to having them with him someday. But later. I need him all to myself for a while first. He seemed really really happy about that, which makes ME feel all goofy and happy. I’m sappy.

We had to drive home Sunday night, but before we went his mom hugged me and said she’s NEVER seen her son like this, and thanked me for taking good care of her baby. And asked if we’d be back for the 4th of July or if we were doing something with my family. And I tried to be all “haaaa no we’ll be here if you don’t mind, I don’t see them much” and I think she caught on that there’s more to the story so she just hugged the shit out of me (vikings, all of them I swear) and told me she can’t wait to see me again.

My ears are still ringing from all the noise and chaos, but it was an absolute blast and I can’t wait to see them again in July. Also, pretty much sure Mike is the man I’m going to marry. I literally can’t think of a single reason why I would ever let him get away.

Anyway thanks for reading, hope you all had a lovely weekend, and those of you who got to see the aurora I’m happy for you but you suck, lol.

**UPDATE (again) Dating a disabled guy: 4th of July**

No we aren’t engaged yet. Yes we have talked about it in the context of how seriously we are taking things. No babies yet either obviously, we are diligent about birth control. I want Mike all to myself for a while.

So, the 4th of July visit to his family’s house was pretty awesome. After getting to know everyone last time I had better expectations of what I was going into, and I’ve talked with my therapist about the whole “play fighting makes me anxious because in my childhood home it wasn’t playing” thing. I don’t want them to ever curb how they act to cater to me, and instead I guess I’ll consider it immersion therapy. I think Mike mentioned it anyway because I didn’t see much of it this time, though there were cheerful threats of doom lobbed about which I didn’t mind at all.

His mom is amazing, I’d like to point out. Even if she moms so hard it makes me weepy. So, background info: I have a really common sounding name spelled REALLY uncommonly. Think Danyell or Jessikah. Because in addition to everything else my parents decided to be creative when they named me. So, although I do sort of like my name, that meant I was that kid who never saw their name personalized on anything. Mike’s family, on the other hand, had like a million kids and they all got traditional names, so personalized stuff was huge for them (it kept them from fighting over stuff I guess.) One of the things in their house, because they have a pool, is that each of the kids (adults now) has their own personalized beach towel that lives at the house.

So we get to their place and it’s been a hot drive there, so right after we get in Mike suggests I go to his room to get changed into a swimsuit so we can have a dip in the pool. I’m thinking that sounds perfect, right? Some of you may already know where this is going…. I get to his room and there is a towel on the bed. In my favorite color. With my fucking stupid-ass-spelled name embroidered into it. So here I am crying over a goddamn towel and he’s in the doorway watching and grinning like he just pranked me or some shit. Turns out it was HER idea but she checked with Mike to make sure it was spelled right. So now I have a towel for when we visit because APPARENTLY I’m welcome.

If I sound cranky it’s just because I’m better at self-depreciation than I am expressing emotions in a direct way. I really am blown away and touched by how much these people have welcomed me. Mike has already sort of learned to decode the way I talk and joke, which is nice, but the first time he gently said “that’s not humor, that’s just putting yourself down, babe,” I definitely wanted to go hide under the table. He doesn’t let me be mean to me. That’s a thing good partners do, I guess? I wouldn’t know. (Again, yes I am in therapy, I am working on myself, it’s not his responsibility to put me back together, it’s just something he does naturally.) I literally told him one night that I was sorry I’m kind of broken, and he snorted and said “at least you can walk” in the most disgusted voice ever and made me laugh.

I digress. So the food was once again amazing, and I kept my promise to teach his mom how to make my cinnamon bun bread pudding, so I felt like I contributed. (Insert Ralph Wiggum “I’m Helping!” meme.) I learned to play Yahtzee, and as it turns out I am very good at it. They do a lot of board games things at night when everyone is staying for the week. These people have a LOT of board games. And puzzles. Whole damn storage closet of the things. They also drink like fuckin FISH and can hold it so I am learning to pace myself. Mike doesn’t drink much when we aren’t there so I’m not worried that it’s a red flag. Only red flag of his that I’ve found was a Red Sox pennant in his room.

Now I realize I might be talking him up a lot, but he isn’t perfect! He snores, he has a habit of arguing with people on the TV when they make stupid decisions, he sometimes starts talking about things I don’t understand and just goes and goes until he realizes he lost me like 15 minutes ago, and he is FASTIDIOUSLY tidy, which makes me feel guilty because I have bad habits to lose. I’m not used to “clutter means I can’t move through an area” but I’m really trying. I barely spend any time at my own place anymore, and we’re definitely looking to move in together sooner than later.

Yeah, so, not that much of an update, no one burned themselves on a firework or anything super exciting, I’m just in an ongoing relationship with a great guy who has a great family and things continue to look up for us. We head home tonight so we can spend some alone time Sunday. Hope everyone else had a safe and happy holiday!

**UPDATE: Dating a disabled guy yes it's me again - 4 weeks later**

I debated just posting this on my own page, but shit , like a lot of people keep asking for more so I guess it doesn’t hurt to drop my post between “AITAH for literally killing someone” and “AITAH for meekly accepting my inlaw’s cruelty but asking if I may wash my wounds before they flog me again.”

This is not an exciting update. Not engaged. No babies on the way, not even freakishly tall ones like some of you are hexing me with. But…. Jess finally met Mike.

TLDR: Learning to read long posts is good for your attention span.

SORRY! I mean I’m not sorry, I feel compelled to open with a joke and I don’t know why. Anyway real TLDR she thinks he’s amazing, she thinks it is HYSTERICAL that I’m on tictok (I refuse to download it) and she is doing amazing. And our lives are moving forward together.

Jess and I have this friend, who I will call Meg and NOT TALULAH despite both Jess and Mike thinking would be hilarious. Meg was planning to have a birthday party, the big THREE OH, and she and Jess are close (and both presently single.) They chose a local bar with outside seating, and Jess did a “wait, lets check their accessibility” because I have been bitching to her for the last month. And lol and be-fucking-hold after calling the place, they didn’t have a ramp for the balcony/outside seating area.

As I have been told Jess said “nope I am meeting Mr. Throwra\_JessComeOn” and so they found another place that’s a damn hike from everyone. But it has a great outside area with accessibility. And THEN we got the invite. Through Facebook because we are all basic, I guess? And Mike was stoked because they have this awesome beer selection (full stop I hate hops sooooo). Then Meg told us that (no I am not using Talulah for the 15% of you going “oh but that was such a better name”) they chose it because Jess wanted Mike to feel welcome. So hats off to Jess for making the comeback impression of the century, I guess.

The birthday was fun, and silly, and everyone in my immediate friend group met Mike and loved him. Tons of laughter, everyone drank way too much, but fortunately we had enough heads up for a planned motel stay (why yes, I do own a UV flashlight, why do you ask?) so we and a bunch of other people didn’t drive home. We actually had brunch in the bar the next day, it was absolutely awesome and I am ruined for pancakes because FLUFFY.

Once again, I digress.

Jess and Mike hit it off and she told him literally every story I didn’t want her to over brunch, and it all was great apart from the persistent hangover. I crashed at Mike’s again. Annnnnnd then he asked what it would cost to break my lease, because he hates the mornings he wakes up and I’m not there. So the next upcoming week and a half or so is going to be insane while I pack up my whole damn life and shove half into a storage unit and the other half into his apartment, and then we’ll be living together.

I know it’s too soon. He does too. We’ve decided we’re idiots and just going for it. My landlord is a lady who is a bit on the older side and isn’t charging me for breaking the lease as long as I leave the place ready for a new renter, so I may respond to comments for a bit right away but expect a lot of silence for a while after.

True TLDR: Best friend made a good second impression, and I’m moving in with Mike ahead of schedule. I should be worried but I’m actually just really excited. Wish me luck!!

**UPDATE: Dating a disabled guy and this headline gets more and more awkward so probably “Dating Mike with the Wheels” from now on - 7 weeks later**

Hey! I get a LOT of messages asking how things are going, but I kinda HATE when people update every five minutes with the “my neighbor looked at me sideways” updates after three paragraphs of recapping drama.

So for those not invested:

Still with Mike. He’s amazing. I will marry him.

We live together now! It’s been trying. As in he is trying not to laugh at how inept I am at cohabitation. I am really good at not leaving stuff out, now, so there’s improvement. He doesn’t infantilize (oOOooO reddit big brain word) me at all but he definitely gives me the grace due an absolute idiot. I appreciate it.

We are not engaged (guys it’s been half a year, come on.)

I’m writing a book about our relationship. It starts with “My name is” and the rest is just notes. Don’t hold your breath.

Jess moved into my old apartment. Yes, my former landlord is the GOAT. Jess is also seeing a guy. I think it is too soon. She agrees. But she has “reasons” (girl we all have needs) and who am I to judge.

Aaaaand I was recently in kind of a serious car accident. I am fine, I have great health insurance, great car insurance, and am recovering just fine. No go funds here, though if you want to help just find a reputable charity for helping victims of drunk drivers and give them your money. So I was on my way home from working overtime and some dude clipped my car and I ended up in a ditch while he just sort of spun out….. but I wear my seatbelt because I have a brain and I got really, really lucky.

Everything is fine, my medical deductible was already paid up for the year, and the worst I had was some bruises, a cracked femur fibula, whiplash, and a totaled car. The silver lining is that Mike is GREAT at caretaking? Another check mark in the having kids category. Also his mom brought us like a million home made frozen dinners in Costco serving trays and we had nowhere to put them so she bought us a fucking chest freezer. I….. guys I don’t even know with this family. They are amazing.

I know usually I give some sweet, heartwarming updates while bitching about mental health, but I am pretty well medicated until my leg heals and I have a few weeks off work to cuddle Mike while watching bad sci-fi, so I’m not in the best place to fill your cups. Sorry. Also don’t watch “Another Life” on Netflix unless you have the ability to set your brain aside because it is the least consistent show I have ever seen. I mean I loved it especially the spine ripping itself out of a person and trying to walk away OH MY GOD but it requires suspension of disbelief like few things I have encountered in all my years.

Also Mike says hi. He indulges meeeee.

Have a good autumn and please for the love of heck don’t drive drunk.

And don’t expect anything from me unless the Thanksgiving gathering is as epic as they claim (ahahaha I almost slipped and said his last name. No doxxing for you today!) because reddit is probably already over my shit.

As always, love you guys for all the support, I’m okay, relationship is fab, and please don’t drink and drive.

Edit: I don't have a cracked femur. Jesus crackers these meds are something. I have a fractured fibula (lower leg, outside bone) and it didn't break all the way through. I have no idea how I mixed those two up. Mike says at least I'm cute when I'm high, but he is clearly biased. So yeah. Cracked fibula, little leg bone, short(ish) healing time. Not femur thank fuck.



**UPDATE: Dating Mike with the wheels, belated Thanksgiving and Christmas updates - 2.5 months later**

I had a Thanksgiving post in my notes almost fully written when unfortunately I got the call. I’ve mentioned before that I had kind of a rough upbringing and have been estranged from my parents for a few years, but they were still my parents, you know? So anyhow my mother passed away the day after Thanksgiving. (Natural causes, she just neglected her health in general.) I hadn’t talked to her since a half hearted attempt last Christmas, she didn’t even know about Mike. And I don’t know if I even feel sad, exactly, but it knocked me for a loop and writing about how great Mike’s family is left a bad taste in my mouth. My therapist says I (paraphrasing here) already mourned the loss of the good parts of my mom when I started processing the bad parts, so my reaction isn’t abnormal. For once.

But it wasn’t the easiest time, and then the funeral meant a whole lot of people I never wanted to see again. Mike was a godsend, he’s so charismatic and charming that no one had anything bad to say to me, it was more like a room of acquaintances. I’m so glad we moved in together, I don’t know how I would have gotten through it and then gone home alone.

So…. I’m going to do this a little out of order. Mike and I spent the whole Christmas week with his parents again, and they were very sympathetic and understanding in the “we respect that you don’t want us to make a big deal” way. Most of his family wasn’t there except for dinner the day after Christmas (just wait till the Thanksgiving recap and you’ll understand why Christmas is so low key, no one could handle that twice in two months.) So it was nice to wake up and feel like family and open presents in my pajamas. Mike and I have matching Christmas ones now. We are ridiculous together, and I love it. Also, it was a white Christmas for the first time in years!!

To those hoping for a proposal….. I did get jewelry! But not a ring. Sorry! Believe me it’s on the table and where we feel we are headed, but we’re not rushing things. Also given everything going on, it wouldn’t have been the right time. But I got a lovely pendant with my birthstone and real diamonds, so I was very spoiled.

Christmas dinner was good and catered, and a lot of chaos and kids and presents, and I missed most of it because I had a pretty bad headache and it was just a LOT at once. But I was there for pictures, and everyone kind of accepts that I’m the future wife even without a ring, so I feel nice and included.

Sorry that this update is on a bit of a downer note, I know I don’t really sound like my usual upbeat self, but I’ll get back there once the holidays, seasonal depression, and STUFF is behind me. That’s why I saved my Thanksgiving post for the end, to hopefully go out on a high note.

The Thanksgiving recap:

Hi all! I get a lot of requests for updates, so I thought I’d share how things are going, now that gluttony day is behind us. Mike and I are happily cohabitating still, things are well on most fronts. I had a minor car accident a little while ago (I posted on my page about it) but I’m mostly healed up now. Mike’s family is still the absolute best, and honestly his mom is more motherly than mine has ever been. Sucks, but it is what it is. (See? That line right there, ouch.)

I’d been warned that Thanksgiving is sort of their BIG holiday, since a lot of the family spends time elsewhere on Christmas. And that it’s a bit of a spectacle. But Lord Almighty I was not prepared for this shit. So, things you need to know: there is some weird “battle of the sexes” thing they do. A few years ago Mike’s mom pointed out that the family kept getting bigger and it was harder to make enough turkey for everyone. So the kids got together (and everyone takes credit for the idea) and bought their dad one of those turkey deep fryers for Christmas. So Thanksgiving rolls around again (I so wish I’d met Mike sooner to see it myself) and thanks to the combination of beer and “I’m sure we can figure this out” ….apparently their dad set fire to the lawn. At least no one was hurt, apart from pride. But after that there was sober practice, and now mom’s turkey vs dad’s turkey is this whole THING. Like there is literally shit talk the whole day. People are set up into camps.

I joked we needed team shirts and I think they actually want to do that next year.

It was all pretty hilarious and casual, and they had like three damn tables set up. Don’t worry, reddit! I made sure no teenagers were being parentified or unliked inlaws were being forced to sit at the kids table. (Actually I was low-key jealous, they got crayons and coloring books.) The food was all amazing and all hands on deck except for me because his mom refused to have me on my feet even though my leg is basically fine now. Mike kept bringing me stuff, it was so cute y’all. I can’t even put into words how much golden retriever energy this boy has.

If you’re wondering who made the better turkey? Ooh man it’s hard. Mike’s mom does a brine (Alton Brown is the GOAT) but there is something about fried turkey skin that is just next level. So I’d say it’s a tie, and that’s not just me being diplomatic. I ate so much that I barely had room for dessert. It was fantastic. I never fall asleep in the car, but I was passed out on the drive home. We had kind of a second Thanksgiving at home the next day from the leftovers, and I probably just put on 50 pounds. No ragrets.

Anyway I’m off to sleep the bird off, I hope you all had a wonderful turkey day and a great Christmas coming up!


**New Update - 1 year Anniversary**

Hello once again, reddit friends! Sorry to anyone who saw my mini-update and felt cheated of the story. Things have been crazy busy since the start of the year.

TL/DR for those who say “I ain’t reading all that” (like you have anything better to do on the shitter): Mike proposed!

I am officially slated to be Mrs. MikeWithTheWheels some time in the next year or so. I will absolutely give you the deets, BUT, first a little on why I haven’t updated or responded much lately. I absolutely love the comments, well wishes, and private messages telling me how much our story has moved them. I can’t believe how many strangers I feel so close to because you’ve gone through similar tough or lonely childhoods, or have/had inlaws that aren’t amazing. I don’t usually respond (shockingly, this isn’t my regular reddit account) but I read them and appreciate you.

On the other side, I’ve gotten some toxicity too, though fortunately not nearly as much as you might expect with the internet these days. A lot of people ask for pictures and stuff, and I’m sorry but that’s not happening. I’ve already given enough details and this has spread far enough that someone doxxed me (they were nice enough, and young, and didn’t realize just how absolutely weird and invasive that was) but it definitely made me step back a little. I don’t mind sharing updates into our life when there’s something to talk about, but I’m still a real person with a real life and I don’t want to be some kind of influencer or whatever. You also won’t see any kind of go fund me or panhandling, I’m not broke, student loans are being paid down, and Mike is rocking his career too. We have enough to be comfortable. If you want to contribute in some positive way to our lives, I recommend making a donation to the Wheelchair Foundation, they do great work and not every family is like Mike’s and could afford a good chair when he was a kid.

And please don’t dox me, it’s already weird enough having Jess laughing at me while playing a Tik Tok of someone reading my writing.

So, back to the mushy crap.

Mike and I have been pretty upfront about the idea that we both want marriage and think this is the real deal, but aside from that, there wasn’t a timeline. Our anniversary was on a different day of the week, and we did take out, but the next Saturday he suggested we go to the same bar we met at and recreate our first date. I thought it was the cutest idea for a date night (yes, I am an idiot.) He brought a book and everything! So, things are stupidly cute, and I’m feeling silly and giddy. And then he tells me about this book he’s reading, would I like to see? And I’m like “Of course!” The cover wasn’t important. What WAS? This boy ordered some Etsy made hollow book. And there it is, THE RING and “Will you marry me” on the inside cover.

Y’all the way I went from bubbly to SOBBING. I had no idea it would hit me like that, I guess even with talking about it somehow I just didn’t expect it? He came over and called me sappy and I babbled something about “YES OBVIOUSLY” and so now there’s a ring on my left hand. We don’t have a date set, but I’m thinking something in the fall, probably. Your girl here gonna get a white dress and everything.

If you’re wondering, (remember back when this was about her?) Jess SCREAMED when I told her and asked if she can wear a suit and give me away and while hilarious, probably not. It would be funny though. She’s doing good though (living at my old place actually) and staying single while she gets her head back in the best shape possible.

So yeah, there it is, he asked, I said yes, and I will be Mrs. Wheels some time in the next year or so! Thanks for all the well wishes and support and love, you have all made my lonely little world brighter the same way Mike has.

Kanina, bigla na lang namatay yung ilaw sa kusina habang nagluluto ako. Pundido na yata. 

Ewan ko ba, bigla na lang tumulo luha ko. I don't usually cry about something that trivial, but it was a small reminder of how I can't seem to catch a break these days. 

Last month, napundi rin yung sa banyo. Nanghiram pa ako ng ladder sa landlady ko kasi hindi ko naman abot yung kisame. I also had to search thoroughly kung ano'ng pwedeng ipalit na ilaw dahil wala akong alam sa gano'n. Hassle na naman. But when you live alone, these are things you just can't put off.

Ang hirap maging independent. Sometimes, I think about how nice it would be to come home to a meal somebody else prepared for me. When work gets overwhelming, I wish somebody else can do the chores and errands for me so I can focus on the tasks at hand. Kahit nga lang taga timpla ng kape, para hindi na ako nangangarag in between meetings to fix myself a cup of coffee.

I can take care of myself, but I allow myself to be vulnerable at times and admit that I would also love to be taken care of.

She’s a Chinese immigrant, thoughtful, emotionally reserved, image-conscious, and very self-critical. She asked for my instagram after I impressed her with my intelligence in class. I asked her out for coffee and she accepted, she said she likes me but recently left a toxic relationship and was clear she doesn’t want anything long-term this year, though she said, “anything can happen.”

I confessed my feelings (through poems and direct conversations), she got emotional, said she felt “fortunate” someone like me had feelings for her, but wasn’t ready. Said we’d “break up in 3 months” if we dated now—not because of me, but because she’s not in a place for a relationship. She’s emphasized not wanting to lose me, said she values me, and that I’m different from other guys she’s dated.

We are currently on other sides of the country a couple months because of placements but will be back on campus together soon, during this time: 
- We message daily and she intitiates about 20% of the time. 
- She asked to read my poems and said she’s using them to learn English—sent me handwritten notes.
- Said she'd coom Chinese for me when I return (but specified that she didn't want it to be romantic).
- Hearted my suggestions of weekend trips together.
- Said our coffee date was more meaningful than any date she’s had.


She’s dated casually before (via Hinge), but she’s also reserved—doesn’t like big crowds, prefers bars to clubs, and values deep connections. I don’t think she’s sleeping around, but she does enjoy attention and has a wide social circle. I also told her I’d be patient and take things at her pace, and she’s never shut that down—only thanked me.

I’m emotionally invested, but grounded. I’ve done the inner work to regulate my anxious attachment, and I’m trying to honor her boundaries while staying connected.

My question:
Does it seem like there’s actual potential here if I continue being patient and present? Or am I investing a future that doesn’t exist? Has anyone been in a dynamic like this—emotional closeness, but blocked by timing and avoidance?

1k2om6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1k2om6r/3_months_off_ffs_and_never_going_back_what_helped/,3 Months Off FFs and Never Going Back (What helped me Quit Personally),"Been clean off FFs after 2.5-3 years of daily use, peaking at 10-12 a day. And I know for a fact I’m never going back. I won’t go into my past struggles with it, just know it was really bad and I felt hopeless like I’d never be able to quit, now here I am on the other side, I’m just here to provide a list of everything I did that helped me quit, and what I’m doing now to help me get off regular kratom and kava that is currently working as well and would likely help with quitting FFs too.

1. This the biggest and most important thing, some would say “don’t substitute, it’s not good to just gain a different habit”. Well, not everyone can do it without substitution to be real, so just incase you’re like me and can’t just go straight sober, or if you just want to make it much easier on yourself, this is what will help quit the most. And as many FF addicts who have done much harder drugs like meth, heroin, alcohol, etc, they say this is the hardest thing they’ve had to quit. So replacing it with another habit is not a bad thing. Especially if the new habit is cheaper, and safer. So I started buying powder kratom in bulk, green for the day time and red for the night for sleep. Whenever I’d start feeling withdrawals, I’d dump a bunch of powder kratom in a cup, mix with water and chug it all, if I needed more I’d do more, but this WILL keep the withdrawals at bay, you’ll still feel down and depressed, but you won’t be feeling the physical withdrawals which are the hardest part for most of us. Green for the day, red for the night. I’d also buy kava drinks from local Kava bars, I found I was way more addicted to the kratom than the kava so I didn’t need as much kava per day, but it still helps and it might cause other issues just CTing kava so I’d recommend keeping it in your system. If there’s no kava bars in your area get kava powder as well in bulk. Has to be instant kava though if it’s not “instant” kava you’ll have to do a bunch of work to prep it so you can drink it. Instant kava just needs to be mixed in water. 

2. Supplements also important, ESPECIALLY magnesium. Magnesium is also insanely good for restless leg syndrome which for me personally and many others is the absolute worst part of WDs. Just keep a bunch of magnesium supplements on you and whenever you start feeling discomfort physically pop one of those and down it with some kratom/water mixture. Also don’t forget to stay hydrated and drink water constantly. I was taking magnesium-potassium which works better because the potassium makes your body absorb it better and quicker. I also had just regular magnesium since I had both already. I also took a couple Ashwaghanda and Vitamin D at the beginning of the day and personally didn’t need to take more through out the day, but if you feel the need to, do it. Ashwaghanda lowers cortisol in your body/brain and cortisol is responsible for stress, it’s known as the stress hormone so this will help alleviate anxiety and stress. Vitamin D will help with the depression. You’ll definitely still feel depressed but it won’t be as bad as it could be. And take melatonin for sleep at night, as much as you need.

3. Coffee. Kratom and maybe kava, but definitely kratom are in the coffee family. For me personally it helped me crave kratom and kava less, and still does. And since it makes you more wired/jittery, it makes the restlessness less u comfortable and more natural since you’re kinda matching that energy by ingesting caffeine. And I heard from someone who owns a natural medicinal store with kratom and all types of other herbs, she said  allegedly FFs have some caffeine in them which is part of why the withdrawal are so brutal. You’re not just withdrawing from kratom and kava apparently, but also caffeine. So drinking coffee will completely mitigate the caffeine aspect. 

4. SEA MOSS. Forgot to put this in the supplement section, but this is so helpful that it deserves its own section anyways. When I discovered that natural medicine store where I was told about the caffeine in FFs. I told them I was trying to quit FF and they said they help sooo many people get off them. She gave me some free sea moss powder, said to just take a tea spoon of it (I took more cuz why not). I was on day 3 of WDs and was feeling so down. She gave me some of that, and IMMEDIATELY felt so much better and every day after that became 10000x easier. Sea moss has like 70 essential minerals and stuff like that that you’re low on from the withdrawals and according by to her are heavily depleted from the caffeine. Either way, getting all these minerals and stuff from this sea moss was a MAJOR game changer. 10/10 recommend it ended my depression on day 3. 

5. Exercise. Not going to lie, I didn’t do much of this. But I did a little bit and it helped. It keeps you busy and distracted and will make you tired/relaxed so you can fall asleep easier. And it pumps dopamine/endorphins that will make you feel good, but since you’re withdrawing will just make you feel better.

6. I didn’t do this to quit FFs, but I’m currently doing this to get off kratom and kava and it’s working, if I tried harder I’d be off them by now but I’m kind of slacking. Not because it’s hard, but because I’m just being an indulgent POS lol. But anyways, ADHD meds like Adderall or Vyvanse will COMPLETELY get rid of your cravings for kratom and kava (FFs too I’m sure). My first day taking it I didn’t drink any at all and didn’t feel any withdrawals. So it lowers cravings completely, and you also won’t feel WDs whatsoever. It does lose its magic the longer you take it. But it still makes it way easier, it’s just a matter of not chasing a high, but if you do do too much it will only be because you wanted to, not because it was unbearable. Cuz you may kind of adopt the “I wanna keep this party going” mentality from taking these stimulants. I kind of have that but am able to control it mostly. If you have been prescribed these before and can get them again I recommend it. It’s really easy to get prescribed them even if you’ve never been previously diagnosed with ADHD, just describe symptoms of ADHD and they will give you them. Don’t mention using it to get off FFs. If you have very and I mean VERY poor self control and an EXTREMELY addictive personality, I wouldn’t recommend this. It’d be terrible for you to just add another habit and not improve on the other or drop it. So know yourself, be objective and decide if this is something you can do. ADHD meds are way easier to get off of WD wise. You just get really tired and kinda depressed/irritable when u stop taking them, but no physical withdrawals. I’m down to 9gpd of kratom now after a couple months when I was doing 25-30gpd of kratom powder prior to starting. Could be done completely or lower than 9gpd if I tried harder. And only doing 4 doses of lava a day on average which could also be done or lower if I tried harder. It’s been magic for me personally but this would be last resort tbh. It does work great though (for me).

7. Being around people, especially loved ones. Making plans with loved ones not only keeps you busy, and feeling better cuz you’re spending time with loved ones, but you may be somewhere you can’t leave for a while and may be far from a location where you can buy FFs, so you’ll have no choice but to stay put and enjoy yourself as much as possible with loved ones/friends. I personally when around family or friends would try so hard to hold it together because I don’t want my friends or family to stress and I want them to have a good time, which made me be stronger so I wouldn’t ruin their fun. That’s just me though.

8. This the MOST important mental trick that helped me. All of us addicts when thinking about quitting are thinking about how long it will take right? How long the withdrawals will last? So we’re in the gutter thinking about how it’s going to take weeks, maybe even a month. Which makes us give up. But if you just concentrate solely on making it through the day. It’s so much easier. Just live on a day to day basis, like the rest of your life is the rest of the day. Just look forward to falling asleep, try and distract yourself every moment you can until the time passes and you’re going to bed. Then do it again, and again. And after day 3/4, especially with these other things I suggested you do, it will be easier and you’ll think “if I made it through the day those other 3 days, I can definitely do it today”. Everyday gets easier after the first few days. Just take it day by day, one day at a time mentality, don’t think about the whole “2 week” thing other people say. Also don’t think about how long it’s been since you quit, that gives it more power, you can go off memory (which eventually will be wrong) but if you have a tracker or something and are putting enough mental energy and effort to remember exactly how long it’s been, it’ll make you more likely to go back. Just try and forget about it as much as possible.

9. Accept the depression, and understand it’s not permanent. Just think of it like “I stole happiness from my future by trying to make myself feel even better by taking this, this is the happiness I stole from myself, so once I pay my dues, I’ll be good again”. The depression you’ll feel from quitting will be over with sooner than if you keep doing these FFs, don’t forget that. Combined with everything else I said the depression won’t be THAT bad, but still will suck. You’ll get through it though and it won’t be forever just remember that. Accept the sadness and understand sadness is part of life anyways and it’s impossible for you to be sad forever. 

That’s everything. The most important things I’d say are drinking powder kratom and kava, taking magnesium and sea moss, and taking it day by day and not thinking long term only on a day by day basis. And staying busy as possible. I promise you, you got this. I thought maybe I’d never quit, and thought maybe I’m one of the unlucky ones who’s too weak to quit, you might think that too but I promise you’re not. You ARE going to quit, trust me. Just get a bunch of powder kratom and kava, magnesium and sea moss, and watch yourself win. Pick and choose what you want from this guide but those things I just mentioned are a MUST. I PROMISE you you will succeed. Hope this helps🤝

I started working for a cell phone company almost 2 months ago. The job is inside Walmart, and I sell prepaid cell phone plans and phones. (I’ll call it Company A). There is a different competing phone company (I’ll call it Company B) who sells postpaid cell phone plans, but we work alongside each other in the same department. 

A week after I started, a new rep for Company B came to my store. I’ll call him Evan. He was very friendly and professional and in his 40s. We developed a good working relationship and over the course of a month and a half I would have considered him somewhat of a friend- not close, but we did talk at work and he would text me if I missed work to check on me. When I got to know him I learned he’s freshly out of prison for DUIs and lives in a sober home. I always respected him and it seemed like he had gotten his life on track, and he never made me feel uncomfortable. 

Last week, he started talking about wanting to move out of his sober home because of lack of privacy. He asked what I pay for rent, and I gave him information about my apartments. I even sent him a text from my complex talking about a referral program, and he said he wanted to try and move there. I thought nothing of it. 

A few days go by and I get a call from him at 9pm. He asked me if he could stay at my house that night because he was no longer staying at the sober home. I told him I would, but that I didn’t have room- my apartment is a studio and I don’t even have a couch, just bar stools and my bed. He told me he didn’t mind if we had to share a bed. I wasn’t comfortable and just said again that I didn’t have room. Still, alarm bells weren’t really going off because he seemed casual about it. 

I came to work the next day and found him sitting in front of the bathroom. I noticed that he looked like someone had hit him in the face. I could immediately tell he was drunk and he was slurring. I felt sad for him because I didn’t want his life to go off the rails again. 

He got increasingly weird throughout the day. It was blatantly obvious. When I came back from lunch, he pushed me to make a statement on the intercom about phone deals. I told him that the script was from Company B, not my own. He was incredibly persistent though and was kind of standing over me, he touched my back. I wanted him to go away so I made the announcement even though it wasn’t mine to make. 

Directly after this, Evan started talking about his manager, who I’ll call Steph. Steph also gave him rides to and from work, and to my understanding he was going to stay at her house. He started talking about how hot Steph was, and how “he’d go for it if she weren’t gay”. Then, he said “why are there so many gay women in this town? Why are you gay? Did a man hurt you?”

I’m gay myself and he never acted like it was a big deal or a problem, so this shocked me. I told him no and that I was just born like this. He said “You don’t like dick at all?” After I told him no he said it was a waste. He asked why I wouldn’t let him stay over the night before. I repeated that I didn’t have room. He said “I could have kept you warm with my breath!” 

I found the Walmart employees I work alongside and found out that he’d been creepy that day with three of them (hugging them, touching them). They didn’t know him hardly at all, he didn’t usually talk to them. He said to one of them “I know you don’t like me but I can tell I’m growing on you” and touched her lower back. He also showed her something on his phone and porn was visible. I also found out that he had gotten into a fight with 4 people at the sober home, which explains his facial injuries. 

We reported him to the Walmart manager, took statements, and waited while they told him he had to leave. Immediately as this was happening, I got two texts from him. They were pretty innocent- he just sent me a smiley emoji, and in the next message just said “Coffee?”

I feel super uncomfortable with all of this. I never responded but didn’t want to block him, because I want to be vigilant and know if he’s trying to contact me. At 1am that same night, he sent me another message that just said “U up?”

I talked to HR today and an investigation was being done. They removed him from my store but he might be at a different Walmart. His own manager was in store today and complained about how a “super aggressive Company A rep got one of my guys thrown out of the store”. I just  laughed it off, I didn’t want him to know it was me. The funny thing is that I’m the most non confrontational person I know- almost pathologically so to be honest. 

I feel so on edge and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. He knows the apartments I live in, but he doesn’t know my apartment number. I feel so many things- mad at myself for trusting him and being naive, scared, guilty because he might lose his job. He’s never been overtly threatening, but it still just feels so jarring. I’m the only coworker he’s texted out of work. 

Is it overreacting to be so paranoid? I don’t know what the safest steps to take are. Should I continue to ignore? Or block? Or set a boundary? I haven’t explicitly told him I’m uninterested. I’ve never experienced anything like this. The other manager made me feel like I shouldn’t have gotten him thrown out. ",1,1745038361.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Ji And Jasmine Join Bambi, As The Slave Welfare Check Crew.","Mary's perspective

I walk out into the hallway to see Layla facing Roz, who has her arms around the younger half mummified woman squeezing and kneading her firm dark, naked behind. The slave's back is to me, Roz, a head taller winks at me as I stop to watch with amusement.

Intimate touches and sex had to be consented to, in writing and recorded, for our file. I had consented to sexual intimacy with Roz, even though QOM and her Executive Domme were willing to give me a pass after my rape and exploitation by Daci. The thing is, every slave knew if you didn't ""consent"" to sex with Roz, she tried to make your time, especially on Beta Slave duty in the Domme Lounge, even more unbearable.

Layla had held out for her first couple times here, which were only a few days at most. But when she found out her ""friends"" on the Perseverance set had volunteered her and Sheila for a two week opening after they'd shot all her relevant scenes for the next few episodes, she quickly capitulated and asked for a consent form and a recording session.

Roz is usually discrete about slave sex, but she liked to trumpet her conquest of Layla, maybe because her fellow former marine held out on ""consent"" longer than any other Beta. And she knew being groped, tweaked and sexualized by a butch dyke in public was more humiliating then being yelled at and whipped. No actual sex in public, but Roz liked to fondle Layla, like now, and talk about what she was going to make her do later in private, in front of others. Too be fair, sex with Roz ranges from very unpleasant (Eating her ass) to very nice at times (She knows all the sweeter spots).

""My sexy little Beaner, are you ready to serve Mistress Roz real good, honey?"" I winced in sympathy as I saw the Butch's grip on the dusky girl's butt become vise tight, that had to hurt. To Layla's credit, she stood at perfect attention facing her bigger Mistress's ample breasts and belted out ""Yeph, Iswees Oz!"" with admirable conviction.

The retired Marine Bar manager wasn't impressed. Her grip got even tighter on the poor, cute little Mexican's butt. ""You call that sounding off, Marine? You sound like a duck quacking for handouts! Try again!"" 

""Yeph, Iswess Oz!"" I have to admit even I'm  impressed at how sharp her reply is, for a gagged, obviously under duress, girl. 

Roz rolls her eyes and sounds annoyed. ""I guess that'll have to do, Marine. We got a lot to do, so I don't have time to calibrate your dumb, delicious Mexican butt. Though I am going to recommend to your friends that I get you for Extended Domme's Lounge duty during the summer shooting hiatus. Though if you want to wimp out, maybe they can spare your cute little half gook writer friend for the position.""

I saw the shudder run through that restrained, sweet little body of hers. She knew weeks as Roz's Bar Slave in the Domme's Lounge would be horrid. And that's just the days. At night she'd know doubt be Roz's little fetish plaything...steamy, hot and humiliating...
But she wouldn't chance Sheila consenting, even insisting on doing it out of stubborn pride. And even with all of QOM's protections, that could trigger traumatic flashbacks to her time as a non-comsensual helot...

A loud double slaps on Layla's ass breaks me out of my reverie with a gunshot crack.
Even the tough Latina former Devil Dog lets out a cute little squeal that makes her Mistress smirk.

Then she whirls her prisoner around and shoves her forward. ""To the Domme's lounge, march, Marine!"" I know she makes Layla march out in front of her to look at that sexy, dusky ass and make crude comments. to be honest, I can't blame her.

As Border Bunny passes me, I notice the slightest flick of her eyes at me that could be taken as a hateful glare. Most non fetish players would never catch it. Most of my Junior Domme's wouldn't catch it. But when you've played both roles for years, you know a quick slave side-eye when you see one. I blow her a kiss as her eyes quickly flick back forward.  I trade another wink with the veteran, rugged bartender. Border Bunny and Zero are going to have a looong day.

When they're gone, I can still hear strict marching commands from Roz, interspersed with crude innuendos about the slave's butt. I chuckle, then turn my attention to business.

I'm dressed in my ""Dark Rommie"" uniform of Charcoal gray blouse, black slacks, and black Jackboots. On my collar is my fictional Stellar Compact Navy rank, on my breasts all Captain Rommie's awards and medals, with the Stellar Compact POW medal added.

The official story about Rommie's return is she survived the crash of the Soul Crusher on Botany Bay colony planet. She was taken by a N'Docc garrison on the isolated continent where it crashed. They recognized she was more valuable alive, so stabilized her medically and managed to clandestinely ship her to an N'Docc""/Amazonian Alliance POW camp during the chaos of early Liberation. The N'Docc"" ran the camp. They felt she fought and endured the disgrace of being a Whipping Girl honorably and was more valuable as a hostage, so they forbade the Amazonians from making her into a Whipping Girl again. She was later rescued by a beyond Top Secret special ops group. She started working for them, which explains the uniform she wears and her promotion to Commodore.

The cover story is a deception. Through means that may be disclosed in a later episode, Commodore Rommie is from the universe of the brutal Star Hegemony. She led a successful campaign to eradicate the Amazonians and the N'Docc. The shadowy Special Ops group, The Knights Of Right, brought her over from her universe to do the same thing in ours.

The first part of the plan is to send a cloaked Perseverance as a vanguard of a cloaked Navy fleet. They're supposed to hold the Felenoid N'Docc home star, Cattus, hostage and negotiate a surrender. Of course, Dark Rommie and her new pals fully intend to launch a Hanuman Sun Crusher torpedo into Cattus before the fleet even arrives.

The crew catches on quickly, despite her being given convincing ""false memories"", that this isn't THEIR Rommie. She drops hints, both intentionally and unconsciously of who she really is and where she's really from. The crew have to decide if they risk charges of mutiny, maybe worse, by challenging and unmasking the imposter.

A fun return to my show, with enough parallels between my real life and fiction. Cast into abject slavery and forgotten, only to be given a Dark Phoenix rise from the ashes.

I feel a spring in my step as I head to the Domme's Lounge for breakfast.

Bambi's perspective

I'm riding Dave's Limo, with two Perseverance cast members, Mistress Jasmine Jamshidi and Mr. Ji Soo Hyun. I find Mister Ji, Dr./Lieutenant Commander Kang on the Perseverance, to be engaging and affable. Jasmine seems like an irritating little mean girl twit, sulking because the handsome Mr. Ji would rather discuss technical details of the script and show with me, then pay attention to her.

Too be fair, she's also in a snit that her role is being recycled from an Amazonian Princess to a wide eyed Ensign. Amazonian Princess Machit is defeated and enslaved in parts unknown, but Mistress Jasmine insisted on another role. So she got it, Ensign Fatima Abdullah, Abdul to her friends. A big Rommie fan girl who's treated with contempt by the dark other universe version. Ji just told me they're  going to try and sell with different hairstyles and make up. It worked for twentieth century Star Trek...

She doesn't like that I asked they be dressed in their Khaki working uniform costumes. I think they look sharp, Ji says it reminds him of his South Korean Army Days. Miss Bedouin Thang thinks they look like ""cos playing geeks"".

Of course there visit also serves a dual purpose as the ""visitation crew"" for Slaves Border Bunny and Zero at Queen Of Mean's compound. Their assignment is to make sure all the slaves needs are met, check their psychological well being, and make sure they're getting their care packages from the Perseverance set. Ji seems like a kind and wise gentleman, but why they'd send Jasmine is beyond me. Either they see good qualities I don't, or they're hoping Ji's will rub off on her. Looking at her staring sullenly out the limo window, occasionally glaring at us huddled over a tablet with Perseverance's specs, and an actual paper Perseverance Technical Manual Ji helped Nora publish, I doubt that.

""So only the Medusa class Dreadnaughts were supposed to carry the Hanuman Nova missiles, do they explain how Perseverance can carry one?"" I'm actually interested in his response, despite the ""nerdy"" subject matter.

""Yes, well, it's explained that a quick mod of the centerline Shuttle bay can accomodate a torpedo, along with it's associated launch and telemetry equipment."" I follow his tapping finger on the tablet, as interested in his technical explanation as his dreamy, sexy voice. Jasmine glares over at us, mutters ""Nerds."" and looks back out the window practically pouting. 

""Did anyone come up with a technical explanation of how one relatively tiny torpedo can make a stable star go nova?""
Ji warms to his topic, though he humbly deflects credit. ""Nora dreamed this up for the Perseverance role playing game, before that Sheila and Dave told me the Hanuman was just ""unexplained sci-fi magic"". The missile houses a microsingularity-a mini black hole- contained by an axion particle containment field. when the missile gets closer to the star the outer casing disintegrates, while the axion contained black hole continues to the star's core. The blackhole consumes all the star's hydrogen fuel, growing bigger in seconds. The  star's helium expands and blows off the outer layers, like a helium burning main sequence star would do at the end of it's natural life cycle, causing a nearly instant artificial nova. Pretty potent weapon of mass destruction.""

""So there's a black hole hanging in space where a normal star used to be?"" I question. Ji smiles ""Nora covers that too, the blackhole consumes fuel rapidly, evaporating with residual traces of Hawking radiation the only evidence it existed. It's supposed to leave a husk of a brown dwarf that still exerts limited gravitational influence on the systems planetary bodies. Though either the possibility of a blackhole in place of the star or a system's star just disappearing are plot points we could use in future episodes. Lara will appreciate the idea, young lady."" Ji will certainly attribute the idea to me when he brings it up to Chief Screen Writer, Lara Gupta.

Jasmine butts in ""Your both cool, hot and you look like you've always been popular. Nora at least has an excuse for her nerdiness, she's a dork who transformed into a cool, hot fetish star and domme, but some old habits die hard, to be fair. But what are two rizzed up beautiful people like you two doing talking like you're sitting at the isolated junior high school nerds' table?"" She looks aggrieved, like we offended some natural order, instead of two people just discussing a Sci-Fi shows techno-babble.

I want to keep ignoring her, but Ji looks like he's had about enough of her mean girl crap. He pins her with a baleful glare which makes her shrink back a little. ""Young lady-"" He begins.

Then the Limo driver calls ""Mr. Ji, Miss Jamshidi, Miss Sux, we're here!"" Here being QOM's compound. I pull out my compact to check my make up. Ji gathers the tablet and the hardcopy technical manual into a compact black briefcase.

Jasmine asks Ji to check her uniform for proper wear and positioning of rank insignia. It makes sense, as the former military man seems an expert on sharp appearances whether military or civilian.
Personally, I think she wants some personal attention from the hunky Asian man. But they both act professional as he gives her last minute pointers on wearing her uniform correctly. I close my compact and take a deep breath. Not my first time at this compound, but last time I came here with the Perseverance women, we got catcalled by some of QOM's dykes like new fish in a bad women's prison movie. Most of the Perseverance women glared back defiantly, but I huddled with Nora in the center, both of us unerved by the sexual taunts.

Stacy, QOM's second in command, assured me she had put out a reminder about proper professional courtesy to all QOM dommes. Plus, the prescence of a man this time might not scare them, but at least throw them off. Hey ho, let's go!


Mary's perspective

As always, Roz's efforts are top notch. The interview will be held in a luxorious red velvet dining nook. Normally, the Domme's Lounge menu is very minimalist, one laminated white sheet, though the food is always the best.

But Roz has gone all out with three page fancy menus, with gold glitter lining and ornate script. Plus Korean dishes for Ji and Persian dishes for Jasmine if they're interested. My place is center with Bambi to my right, Ji to my left, and Jasmine to his left. Perfect lighting and good acoustics, as per my request. Thanks, Roz

I look at where the still vet wrapped Border Bunny and Slave Zero are standing at attention, getting a stern lecture from Alpha Slave Ann, walking back and forth in front of them slapping a crop in her  hand for emphasis. Amelia stands to the right, hands on hips, smirking. Despite her casual stance, I know she'll give me a full report on her evaluation of Ann's performance.

I think she's doing good, so far. I look at little closer at the bobcut blonde. She reminds me a little of Nora towards the end of the First Season, still nervous, but growing in her role as Alpha Slave. When I got demoted beneath her she was a little beast. I hated her for it at first, but I've come to blame Sheila and Layla for not supervising her properly. And those bitches sure reaped their due Karma, not just under Nora's thumb now, but mine.

My phone buzzes and I check my text.

Mistress Downey: Good Morning, Mistress Mary. I've greeted Master Ji, Mistress Jasmine and Mistress Sux and verified their identities. Are you ready for me to escort them them to the Lounge?

Mistress Mary: Yes, Mistress Downey, I'm ready for them, bring them here at once.

Mistress Downey: On my way.

A minute later,  A handsome Korean man in a futuristic Khaki Officers working uniform enters, flanked to his right by a fake titted, bleached blonde in a Vera Wang blouse, Gucci slacks, and Armani flats. To his right is a pretty dark Persian girl in a slightly less ornate Khaki uniform.
Ji, Jasmine, and Bambi.

Border Bunny and Zero's eyes widen when they see Ji. They know him well, but visitation is normally done by the women, Top Domme Constance (My former roommate here when we were both slaves), Chief Screenwriter Lara Gupta, Chief Disciplinarian Nora, or Sheila's younger sister Sandy. Ji is unexpected.

Their eyes quickly lock straight ahead as Ann starts shouting at them about what the fuck do they think they're looking at. Amelia jumps in, walking behind the slaves to scream in their ears about not polluting guests with their scummy slave gaze. She punctuates her scolding with flicks of a metal studded red flogger on their bare butts.

The guest party stops to watch. Ji's jaw tightens, and his fists clench, it takes all his discipline not to intervene. He's good friends with Shelia, they even played chess over coffee together the First Season. And he respects Layla from working with her. He knows he has no cause to interfere, but hates the spectacle of two people he holds in high esteem being publicly disgraced.

Bambi's face is a mask of observant professionalism as she jots notes furiously in a paper notebook. She got on well with Sheila and Layla as free women, but a story is a story. And the fall of two hot, well known dommes in our industry is a scoop. I aim to make it a big one for her.

Jasmine has her arms folded, smirking at the spectacle, looking like she's itching to join in. Her complaints about the Perseverance set being too soft on and familiar with slaves is well known. I remember Constance telling me spending Christmas day with the Perseverance crew, dommes and subs roles shelved as equals for the holiday, softened some of her attitudes a little. But this is more like what she's used to.

She's a ""loaner"" domme from Mistress Katie's Fetish Entertainment And Productions to the Perseverance set. Mistress Katie's attitude towards fetish roles being a rigid hierarchy more closely aligns with QOM's philosophy. I should ask Stacy if we can approach her with an offer of some Domme Apprenticeship training. Sandy and Nora have taken Junior Domme training with us, even Dave admits it's improved their abilities. Jasmine would probably benefit even more then those two, she's a perfect fit for our mean girl Junior Domme clique.

Mistress Downey, a twenty two year old long haired brunette, tactfully but firmly directs the guests away from the spectacle of slave discipline. Ji's eyes soften as they fall on me. We're old friends from when I was Dave's girl, from even before the Perseverance. He even joked if Dave got tired of me, he'd take me back to Korea with him. How I wished he was there when I was Nora's bitch. It all worked out, though.

I bow, per Korean protocol, as Ji approaches, the custom is women must bow deeper and first to men. Ji bows back, slightly shallower. Then he holds out his hand to shake. This is also Korean custom, Western women warrant a respectful handshake after bowing, to acknowledge their respect for Korean cultural protocols.

""Mary! I heard you ran into a bit of trouble after I left in the first season! Glad to see you doing well, young lady! Still wish Dave had told me he was irate with you, I'd of flown in just to bring you back with me.""
He squeezes my hand warmly to demonstrate his sincerity in his offer.

As I release his hand I laugh. ""Ji, you old flatterer, I can't believe even you would have the audacity to bring a round eyed barbarian women into the heart of Chosun as your concubine. Though if you did I'd have been happy to go! Anyway, as you see, every thing worked out for the best.""

Now his face sobers as he looks back at the slaves. ""I do see..."" Amelia is putting a collar on a stoic Bunny. Ann is attaching bells to the clamped nipples of an impassive Zero. His tone says what he sees doesn't persuade him every thing has worked out for the best...at least not for everyone.

Jasmine steps in, hand out. ""Mistress Mary! I'm so looking forward to working with you. Heard they did you dirty after the First Season, Boss Bitch Sheila wrote you as an expendable prop during your captive Amazonian Whipping girl story arc. Then she wrote you out in the most humiliating way possible. You're sure showing her with your comeback!"" She looks over her shoulder with a grin. Ann is at Sheila's right side, cupping her right breast and playfully whispering something in her ear. The former boss bitch's face is pure granite, but her eyes blaze with anger at whatever her Alpha is saying.

""Yes, well, my former colleagues, Sheila and Layla, know how fast roles can switch in this business. I treat them with the same degree of professionalism they treated me when our roles were reversed. But this is just fetish show biz, nothing personal, Mistress Jasmine."" Jasmine turns back to me with a conspiratorial smile, hearing the subtext. ""Call me Jaz, all my friends do. Mistress Jasmine is for the slaves."" She waves a hand dismissively at Sheila and Layla without even looking at them. Ji looks between us, then back at the slaves, his frown deepening.

""Call me Mary, please, dear. I think the title Mistress can be used respectfully by anyone, but I prefer my friends call me Mary."" We exchange looks that confirm we're kindred souls.

Then I turn to Bambi, her head cocked at an angle, looking at me a little too thoughtfully. I remember a rumor in the fetish industry that her odd mannerisms and dippy behavior are caused by Asperger's syndrome or some other form of high functioning autism. That may just be a rumor, but I know even at our first meeting the dumb blonde persona is deceptive, she's one sharp cookie, for a bimbo reporter. Got to be careful around her.

I hold out my hand ""Bambi Sux, aka Gail Crosby, your reputation proceeds you. I heard FNN brought you on to be eye candy for their fluff pieces, and now your a nominee for the Excellence In Fetish Journalism award. And the girl who blew one hundred guys in a day just to prove she could during her porn star days.""

Her shake is firm, though she's a little off guard at how much homework I've done on her. Still, she smiles gamely ""I don't recommend blowing that many dudes to anyone, my throat was sore for a week, I had to use text to voice and notes to communicate."" 

Ji actually looks a little shocked, while Jasmine smirks. ""Guess we know why your stage name is Sux. Never met a nerdy ho before, were you the girl blowing the chess club while the rest of us were sucking football player dicks?""  

Bambi shrugs modestly. ""Hey, those boys didn't get much pussy, so they made the most of it when they did. Plus nerds can have suprisingly...large...dicks."" She licks her lips suggestively and winks at Jaz. The Persian girl looks deflated at how easily her dig was deflected by Miss Silicone N Bleach.

I slide into my center nook as I invite my guests to take seats. They have Fancy gold lettered name placards next to their menus for ease of seating arrangements. I pick up the silver bell in the center of the table and ring it. Amelia and Ann whip and prod Border Bunny and Zero to our table with their flogger and crop. When they arrive I say ""These will be our primary serving crew during our interview. Mistress Amelia?""

On her cue, Amelia bows and says ""Ladies and gentleman, welcome to Queen Of Mean's Domme Lounge. I'm the head of your serving crew, Mistress Amelia. You have any trouble with this lot,"" She gestures and glares menacingly at Alpha Slave Ann and the Betas. ""You just call for me to straighten'em out. They'll behave after I redden their cute little bums for'em. Alpha Slave Ann?""

Ann gulps a little nervously that the domme's threat covers her as well as her charges. But she sounds steady. ""Mistresses  and Master, I'm Alpha Slave Ann. I'll be running these two"" She gestures absently at Zero and Border Bunny with her crop. ""For your comfort and amusement. If you have any issue with these two little bare butts, please ask for me before you bother Mistress Amelia. I'll straighten them out."" She glares murder at her two wards. They look sensibly wary of her authority, but two BDSM veterans aren't scared easily by some puffed rookie. I smirked, at least, not yet. Just wait, girls.

Ann barks at them ""Greet the nice Mistresses and Master like I taught you, slaves!"" They both chorus ""Eeetings, Iswess an aster. aves ero n order hony ur eaer ooo erve ooo!"" Greetings, Mistresses and Master. Slaves Zero and Border Bunny are eager to serve you!""

Ji quickly replies ""Thank you, ladies, Mistress Amelia, Alpha Ann, Zero and Border Bunny."" Then he narrows his focus ""Sheila, Layla my apologies we didn't get the word I'd be doing the visitation. All of the trusted female staff are very busy, only Jasmine was available. As Miss Jamshidi is inexperienced at welfare checks, I volunteered to accompany her. I realize QOM doesn't prioritize keeping slaves informed. No offense Mary, Amelia and Ann, just a cultural difference. But if this happens again I'll personally ensure you get the word. We have a private check in at 3pm today, we'll speak more freely then.""

Amelia, Ann and Jasmine all looked offended at this man who has the temerity to talk to slaves like real people and actually apologize to them. Bambi kept scribbling, while looking eager for more.
Jaz spoke up first. ""Do you have their infraction books? I'd like to inspect them."" Ann almost tripped in her eagerness to offer them to the visiting domme. ""Here they are Mistress Jasmime."" She held out two small black books labeled ""Slave Zero's Infraction book"" and ""Slave Border Bunny's  Infraction Book"" in gold lettering. Jaz accepts the offering graciously ""Thank you, Alpha Slave Ann.""
Ji looks at her a bit annoyed.

Jas glares back at the older man ""What, dude? It's part of our job to see how well they're holding to another outfits discipline when we loan them out. That's from Chief Disciplinarian Nora, approved by Lara and Constance."" Ji sits back with a sigh, he knows it is true, he'd reviewed the standards in a meeting with Constance, Lara, Nora and Sandy.
Buoyed by her small victory, she turns to the slaves. ""I think I'm going to take pictures of some of the pages with the most demerits and text them to Nora. She's been in a mighty foul mood lately. You girls might have some nasty suprises waiting for you when you get back.""

Now the slaves do look really nervous. They'd both suffered, sometimes excessively, under Nora's strict discipline. While a lot of training and accountability rules had blunted her sadistic streak, they knew she could cook up imaginative and brilliantly cruel punishments for erring slaves. And she had plenty of time to get her proposals approved by the current Perseverance hierarchy.

Jasmine has her focus, now to get Bambi and Ji, focused on me. ""So, Bambi, I hear you're really interested in the Dark Rommie story arc. Was there something specific you'd like to know?""

Bambi turns eagerly to me, and Ji breaks his focus on Jasmine's review of the slave's Infraction logs to follow our conversation. The sexy old nerd can't resist an opportunity to geeks out on sci-fi lore. ""Tell me more specifically about ""Dark Rommie"" and her place in the power structure of the mirror universe's Star Hegemony?""

As I start to expound, I side eye Jasmine casually inspecting the slave's Infraction books, phone in hand, camera app no doubt online. She looks so relaxed and at ease, while the slaves look tense and nervous, I can imagine the sweat beading their foreheads under the vet wrap. I mark the Persian girl as a subject of the next leadership meeting on our Domme Apprenticeship program. This little gal has potential.

1k2ogzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildofHoarder/comments/1k2ogzd/just_realized_my_mother_was_a_hoarder/,Just realized my mother was a hoarder,"I’m in a bit of a weird headspace. I don’t really know how I came across this subreddit, I think just following a series of links. As I started reading past posts, I gradually and inexplicably grew more and more uneasy, but comforted in the community’s responses to people’s stories and experiences.

My mother was mentally ill. Symptoms started developing after my little brother was born, I was five at the time. I don’t recall much of how it started, but from what I’ve been told she accused my father of placing mics in outlets and having her followed. She began using meth and that made her much, much more unstable. Eventually Mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My parents got divorced and she lost custody rights when she insisted on testifying on her own behalf. She disappeared for about a year and came back clean, but at that point totally lost in her illness. 

To be clear, Mom loved my brother and I more than anything in the world. She never intentionally harmed us and despite her illness, tried to be the best mother she could be. Dad facilitated us staying with her for a few days a week when things were calm (e.g., there wasn’t a risk that she’d take us to a different state or let us miss days of school). She moved into public housing and dad never saw the inside of her apartment; he’d wait in the parking lot for us to come out to him.

In hindsight, I don’t think he would have let us stay with Mom overnight had he seen what things were like. The walls were made of cardboard boxes and old books Mom had collected when she was healthy. She’d earned a bachelor’s degree on her way to a career in social work before she met my father and settled down. There were bowls full of days-old cereal and oatmeal perched on the back of the couch and slid under the piled-high coffee table. Those were from my brother and I; I think she was scared to ask us told clean because she felt we preferred our father’s house and didn’t want to alienate us by giving us chores. She didn’t have the capacity to clean much on her own. 

She got my brother and I two kittens, Puff and Francis, I think for a similar reason. Trying to tip the scales to make ‘Mom’s house’ as appealing as our father’s so we’d be happy and want to stay. The litter box sat at the top of the stairs because it was one of the only flat surfaces available on the floor, so cat litter got kicked around and carried to almost every other area of the apartment, including the beds and couches. Rooms gradually became inaccessible as they accumulated relics from a brighter past that Mom wanted to keep for whenever the forces conspiring against her were finally defeated and she returned to a normalcy that she knew was lacking, but didn’t understand was probably lost forever. 

There were toys everywhere, she and my little brother slept on a bed of them in a room with walls he covered in crayon. I was lucky to have a room to myself that I tried to keep as clean as possible. It was the only tidy area of the house besides the ubiquitous car litter, and I later found out mom slept in there when we weren’t over. 

One night when I was around 11, she came into my room, hugged me, and started sobbing. I remember her saying she hated living in “this rat hole.” We talked for a while, but I remember not being able to sleep after with the knowledge that she actually recognized how bad things were. It was profoundly upsetting and scary for reasons I still can’t articulate. More so because she never expressed sentiment again, which made it feel like a bad dream.

Mom passed away when I was twelve, and I don’t think I’ll ever fully resolve the guilt I’ve felt for the twinge of relief that came with the sorrow. As people in hazmat suits cleaned out Mom’s apartment, my brother and I got used to living in stability and cleanliness full-time, but without Mom’s bedtime stories, movie nights and laugh.

As I was reading some people’s reflections tonight, though, I noticed I could empathize in a way I haven’t in the past. A lot of bad things happened back then, but I think my memories of Mom’s apartment have come to represent all of it. I’ve hated that thought in the past because I perceived it as being upset at “the mess,” which might seem trivial to someone who hasn’t experienced the same thing. People described the same things I felt back then: the embarrassment that they could never have friends over, the lack of security in knowing their caregiver(s) couldn’t provide something fundamental, the weight of feeling like they needed to be an adult because in at least one crucial aspect, nobody else would or could. 

My heart goes out to everyone who still has to live with “the mess,” and thank you all for what you’ve written in the past. Intentionally or not, you’ve helped me a lot.

* South Florida, USA

During my trip to the ER the vet took xrays where a cyst was spotted along with fluid like substance (possibly chyle) in his lungs. They removed 800ml of fluids from his right lung. The fluid was mostly pale yellow with a really light undertone of red. They made several suggestions including pyothorax, empyema, or Chylothorax with the latter being my guess after countless hours of personal research. Friday i took him to another vet to get  a second opinion, where the Dr. opinioned Chylothorax. They couldn't perform an ultrasound because the doctor who is in charge of ultrasounds was in surgery and not available until Monday. He prescribed 500mg amoxicillin 2x daily and recommended Rutin 500mg 3x daily, which i  ordered overnight. He also recommended a no/low fat diet. Which ive implemented by cooking him chicken breast and various vegetables. His stole seems normal.

Is there anything more i could give him to help his breathing? Or help/speed his recovery?

Are the underlying facts consistent with Chylothorax?

How soon with his his new treatment plan could i see him get better?

Side note: he consumed a full bag of pumpkin and chai seed treats that my daughter left on the coffee table. Which is high in fat being part of the seed family. Could this have anything to do with his current state/condition?",0,1745037714.0,AskVet,2,0.5,False

And I drank and WOAH... The bitterness was more amplified and more ""RAW"" yk, and i couldn't finish it once, took 5 to 10 minutes of breaks for just ""sips"", almost 30 mins just to finish ½ of the cup and my mouth was full of bitter and I was hitting ""the peak"", then it just took 15 mins to finish the rest. Still feeling the bitterness, and the energy boost. I really don't mind the bitter taste cuz I got used to it and made to a point where i like it now, it's almost like taking a dr*g and reaching the peak, then it fades slowly (taking hours) which makes it even more addictive.

How do I (24f) come to terms with this?,"Boyfriend (25m) and I (24f) have been dating for over 6 years. Over the past few years he has progressively become more introverted and anti social. I thought this was fine at first given that I wasn’t a big people person myself. Though, it has gotten worse overtime. He pretty much will turn down any time I ask him if he wants to go out, visit friends, or family. But he’ll go out any time if it’s for food or small new activities as a couple like we went to see a cave couple months ago and are going horseback riding next week. His social battery is also very low, he will go out with just me and after about 2 hours, he just feels done and wants to go back home. He will spend his time gaming a lot. At most 6-8 hours in a day (not daily but frequently). The things he will do with me at home are cook, watch anime, and game (I’m not a big gamer so I’ll spend at most, a little over 1 hour gaming). He also spends a lot of time on his phone so I’ll try to prompt questions or bring up random topics to talk about to spark a conversation. Sometimes it works, other times he’s not interested. We’ve had many talks about my thoughts and opinions on all this and he was able to share his perspective which is usually “Yeah I’d like to do more things. But also, I can’t live without my phone the way you can, it’s just not how I operate with my career and things.” But anyways. I’ll invite him out to coffee, the park, visit some friends, the answer is normally no (a yes comes at a 5% probability). It does break my heart, he wasn’t always like this. The first 2-3 years that we dated, we were always going out and he was always engaged. Not so much anymore. I told him it felt like the relationship was put on the back burner to which he said that he’s just really burdened financially and gaming helps him escape. He loves the relationship, he’s just stressed out. I try to help him through this by having daily talks about his day, a gentle massage, and any other things that could help relax him. But I know it’s up to him to want to change and manage his stress. It just hurts. I told him I do feel alone. I have already accepted him saying no to my invites. Although I’ll never stop asking him.

1k2o2z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatnotapp/comments/1k2o2z1/reviews_on_liquidation_sellers/,Reviews on liquidation sellers,"I was perusing a particular liquidation sellers reviews today for fun. To be fair there were a lot of 5 stars but they could have been givvy winners or something. I wish more buyers would think twice before swiping on used and return items thinking the value is anywhere close to retail. These were taken from just the last few days. 

**Machine doesn’t froth. No manual. Sticky residue all over the machine. Won’t buy again!**

**I couldn’t give more than 3 stars for this (and that’s being generous) because the simple fact that what I ordered vs. what I got was very unexpected. I understand Open-box but I did NOT expect it to be so disgusting and used, like to the point it shouldn’t even have been sold like that. It was clogged with cat hair/debris , which my family is DEATHLY allergic to and is a serious health risk sending customers such harmful item**

**Don’t ever buy from these guys I got an air fryer and it was used and the bad thing was it was not even cleaned. There’s still grease in it so watch out when you buy from these guys not happy at all. I don’t see how they’re the number one sellingstreamers on this platform selling crap. And it took over two weeks to get here. And the packing sucked in a oversized box with a handful of peanut**

**It was dirty and still had food and mold on the item very disappointing. I expect it to be used but I expect it to be clean**

**Used dirty item . I knew it was an open box item but never was it specified the item was used. I’m talking about USED not slightly either…. Buyers be careful some items can potentially be used without your knowledge upon purchase.**

**Is a used filter. Wet filter and water inside water container. Garbage. I want a refund.**

**Was supposed to be anew Cuisinart. Coffee grinder as shown on video. Instead was sent a used piece of crap off brand coffee grinder that smells burnt out!!!**

**Instapot came damaged and broken. Can not use lid for safe cooking. Never had an issue before on other items I purchased. I hate this happened. Shipping was delayed due to them being suspended.**

**I went on a spending frenzy with AL & have been disappointed after receiving each purchase. I just took the L & moved on but the item I received today has got to be a joke. The seller mentioned brand new, which is the only reason I purchased it; received the item today & it is filthy. I don’t even bother sending messages bc I don’t get any responses. I’ve also made plenty of purchases on whatnot & have experienced the worst shipping times with AL. Not looking forward to whatever else I have coming in.**

**Terrible toaster. It burns one side of the toast while the other side is barely brown. And it was overpriced.**

**Boxes were taped together ruining the boxes. I received the wrong item entirely. Several boxes inside were also damaged. They were not disclosed as damaged prior to shipping so it may have happened during shipping. They need to slow down a little bit explain items run the auction and label that item. They are rushing and rushing screws up orders.**

**I am upset because I over paid on the toy it had a price of $10 on it. I don’t feel like I am saving anything.**

**Item did not work. Looked used. Thought it was the bigger one but definitely was not, This part is my fault but I over paid by triple the price. 2nd issue I've had with them. Seem to be good people just not the best product.**

**I wish they would have let us know that the item was used and dirty. If I would have known that I wouldn’t have purchased it**

**I’m only picking one star because I have to I would give a 0**  
  
**5 out of 7 products are plain trash**

**The press on nails are used 😵‍💫 theres literally layers of nail on these… you guuuyyyyysssss! I wish I could post pictures… 😭**

**I am so completely disgusted!!! Does no one even bother to look at the contents? This has got to be some sort of health code violation. You sent me a USED toilet lift seat I ordered to give to my aging father. It has has what appears to be BLOOD on the seat! I don't even want to touch it to dispose of it. I will never order from you again. You need to be shut down until you learn how to run your operation in a way that doesn't pose a health risk to people. I'm horrified.**

**Said open box but both products were used and in the applicator’s wand. It should have said used**

**Product was trash not worth 17 that I paid for should have been more like 5 bucks**

**This coffee pot was used. I knew it was open box, please it should be clean! Uck I never would have bought two used coffee makers for the price paid!**

**Keychain was nice. The rice cooker is missing the lid. This is the second purchase from them. The first one was a humidifier that was completely useless. It was so dirty and nasty inside, like somebody returned it. Well used and then now the rice cooker without a lid. This is unacceptable. sell It as open box, so that means you should be looking in them to make sure everything is good before selling.**

Saved this one for last. Whatnot probably lost a customer because of them.

**This item was very used. This is the second time I’ve gotten an item that was more than just an “open box” ..actually a used items. Reason why I’m deleting this app.**",2,1745036725.0,whatnotapp,1,1.0,False

\--------------------

Vergil stood atop the walls and watched the horizon. A clear blue sky stretched above the Cauldron, promising a day that could be if not warm, at least not freezing anymore. Still, his breath misted in the chill. It felt like forever since he’d actually enjoyed seeing the open sky and all the colours of daylight.

His first weeks in Valen felt a lifetime away, as if they’d happened to someone else and not him. He did not want to think much on the rest.

The cave. The ratmen…

He’d killed several beastmen before the sun had risen and Tallah had left. These had climbed the walls like cockroaches and been cut down. He and Arin had been tasked with patrolling the lower bastions, part of a force aimed at keeping the monsters from reaching the higher landings.

Some of those daemons had rat features and stank worse than Vergil remembered the creatures. Horvath had pointed out they weren’t the same kind of monster. Ratmen and rat-like daemons bore little resemblance to one another aside from their physical features. They fought differently. Did not speak. Had no structure.

Still, it had felt good to wet his new sword on their blood. The more he swung Promise, the more comfortable he felt doing so. Its grip fit his hand. He’d earned the weapon on his own. And he’d bathed it in the blood of monsters.

Life, for a short moment, felt good. Even the ache in his back and shoulders felt good, earned through effort and blood spilling. Part of him worried at where the appetite for blood would lead, but was ignored.

Arin came to stand next to him on the wall, also staring out into the Cauldron.

“Heard you had sharp eyes,” the soldier said.

“Something like that.” Vergil nodded, not pulling his gaze away from the still thawing vista.

Tallah was somewhere towards the east, inside the ravine, past the forest. Snow sloughed off the tallest trees there. It made small rainbows in the light.

“Searching for Cinder’s path?” Arin took off his helmet and dabbed sweat off his brow. He’d been carrying messages across the many bastions that lined the Rock’s walls, bent to the task since first light. Vilfor rode him and the others hard.

“Yep.” Vergil blew out his cheeks and let out a thick plume of white vapour. “Fool’s hope, I know. I can’t help but worry.”

Arin laughed and elbowed Vergil lightly in the ribs. “I don’t think she’s the one you ought to be worried for. If anyone can make the crossing, it’s Cinder. She’s a living legend.”

That, Tallah was. But Vergil had seen her at the ends of her strength and knew her to be as human as he or Arin. She had a plan for this mission—and he’d seen her handing off the second shard to Sil earlier—but still, he couldn’t help but worry. She might’ve had some down time recently, but he doubted the sorceress was anywhere near her full strength anymore. She’d not been allowed in the fight for two nights but had that even been enough to replenish her strength entirely?

If he’d known of the scouting force heading into the forest, he would’ve offered to join as well, go and see what sort of monsters roamed the daylight.

“Not really talkative today, I take it?” Arin said, back leaning against the same parapet.

Vergil shook out of his reverie and turned to the soldier. “Sorry. Just worried. I can’t help but expect something terrible to happen. It’s like it’s in the air.”

The night’s assault had been too light. Too easy. He’d barely fought and the soldiers had barely bled. Whenever things worked out so well, he was certain something, somewhere brewed. It was never nice.

His plan and Tallah had worked well in Valen until the prince showed up.

They’d crossed the chasm in the Crags fine, until the earthquake nearly sent them plummeting to their deaths.

Exploring Grefe had gone reasonably easy, until the spiders ambushed them.

Maybe it was the combined influence of Horvath and Tallah, but he was beginning to see threats in every corner and shadow.

“Are you done with your missions?” he asked Arin, more to distract himself.

“Aye. Delivered all missives. Got none back. I’m scheduled to go and rest now but can’t say I’m tired enough to do so.”

They turned and walked off together, following the line of the wall towards the stairs. The Cauldron was quiet. The Rock, not so much. Men called out the repairs that were still underway and the siege equipment being serviced. Soldiers were out near the walls, burning corpses and building fresh pyres for the night. It was as busy as Grefe after Erisa’s death.

The thought had him wondering where Luna had gotten to. The spider hadn’t returned for quite some time, busy as it was exploring the gargantuan fortress. He only hoped it hadn’t gotten itself into some trouble, but was reasonably certain that sight of it would stir enough of a bother that he’d hear of it.

“I’m heading into the ward to see if Sil needs anything. Won’t say no to having company,” he ventured toward Arin. “Join me? They have decent coffee.”

Arin shuddered. “Vergil, I’d rather pick up dung, soak it in water, and drink the resulting mixture, than risk another taste of the healers’ brew. I had it once. Felt I was dying for two days after. Couldn’t sleep for three.”

Vergil laughed as they descended. They had to wait on the first landing for a group carrying weapons to head up.

“I don’t think it’s quite that bad,” he said. “Sil has this tonic that’s far, far worse than the coffee. You wouldn’t believe the things she added to it. Kept us upright and marching for three days straight.”

“She’d better not show it to Kor or to Commander Vilfor. I wouldn’t put it past them to have us on rotation for two days straight if we could.”

The Rock was alive and it was vital. The attack inside the city had come and gone. The attacks on the walls washed off them harmlessly. There was cheer in the air, faith that the tide could turn now.

*Funny how that works.* He was still getting used to the strange optimism of the place. They’d been a step away from total disaster before, but a couple of victories had been enough to bolster morale and improve everyone’s disposition. He even saw some of the adventurers working down there, applying their skills to help prepare for the next push.

One of the men in the courts, he was certain, was Cram, Licia’s companion. The bald man was halfway out of armour and hammered nails into some wooden assembly. They were building fresh siege engines, ready to chuck more stones out and over the wall.

Word had spread of Tallah’s mission. As they approached the soldiers in the courtyard, Vergil caught snippets of conversation.

“—going to unite the Rock and Anvil. Finally, a workable plan.”

“More men, more mouths to feed—”

“More hands to bear arms you mean. We can break their backs!”

“Tunnels still sealed. How will we get there or them here? Fool’s quest.”

“Tunnels got blown when the distillery exploded. No way out but the ravine, and that’s been sealed.”

“Healers got a break. Haven’t lost a soul recently.”

“Damin died.”

“Damin was an idiot. He fell on his own blade—”

Cautious optimism mingled together with a pragmatic attitude towards survival and various other anecdotes of living at the Rock. Resting soldiers spoke of Cinder’s old exploits. Vergil stopped Arin and they eavesdropped for a time.

“Heard she’s earned the moniker after what she done on her first mission here,” a grizzled old bear of a man said to his companions. They were busy oiling crossbows. “Heards it from Vilfor’s old commander. Cinder came with the rest. There was a bad infestation that thaw. She didn’t want to go out and fight openly. Had men digging holes and trenches. Filled them up with kindling and night’s blood.” He chuckled to himself. “She blew them to smithereens on that night. Killed scores with a single fireball. Dirty tactic, but worked.”

Vergil smiled. It sounded like Tallah alright, though these days she preferred a more head-first approach most of the time. They moved on as other men picked up the storyteller’s role.

They found Sil hunched over her alembics and other assorted glass apparatus, carefully measuring some fine powder on a mechanical scale. She scooped it up and added it to a boiling clear solution. It immediately turned ruby red, a bit like blood. She used a pair of metal tongues to removed the glass vial off the flame and set it aside. The scary girl from before—Vergil struggled remembering her name—was next to the healer, taking notes. She had a whole array of glass tubes next to her, together with stoppers.

“After it cools, pour exactly ten drops in each vial. It should be sufficient for an adult. Top off with the alcohol mixture and let set it on the flame again until it turns orange.” She thought for a time while she waited for the girl to finish writing. “If you ever brew this for a child, use as many drops as summers the child’s lived. More and it can send the patient into fits. Nothing fatal, but kids can bite their tongues off.”

She noticed them in the doorway when she turned.

“Unless one of you is wounded, I’d rather you don’t take up space for nothing,” she said, crisply.

Both Vergil and Arin got out of her way as she swept out and into the triage ward, checking on those that hadn’t received the goddess’s blessing. Vergil trailed after her as she stopped to talk to the sick and hurt. Unlike on other days, more healers were now free to work on the less severe cases.

While the treat still loomed, only those in the worst condition could receive the goddess’s healing or any of the accelerants.

Vergil felt slightly ashamed of himself for how many of those he’d wasted in Valen.

“I just came to see if you need anything, Sil,” Vergil said. Arin remained behind in the outer hallway, taking the warning to heart. “Also, I need some coffee.”

“Bucket’s past the alchemy tables. Grab a mug. Dip it in. Get out.”

“Do you know anything about Tallah?” he tried. Sil wore the shard in a small bag tied around her neck. He could see its cord. “Did she contact you?”

“Shards don’t work that way, boy.” She checked the pulse on a wounded woman, then inspected the bandages on her arm. “I have draughts in my thigh pouch if she does return and is wounded. All is in hand. Go and see to your own duties.”

“I don’t… have any,” he said. “Everyone’s busy. Nobody needs my help.”

“Then go rest. Drink with that elendine or something. Don’t hover about.”

He didn’t want to go down into the city proper, not if Tallah could somehow return at any moment. Watching the Cauldron got him antsy. Going to drink would make his anxiety spike. He had a bad feeling but didn’t know how exactly to articulate it.

“Can I help you with anything?” he asked as Sil moved on from the wounded soldier to a wounded civilian. He’d lost an eye somehow and his face was swollen.

“Get out of my ward and out of my hair. I don’t need anything.”

When she walked, her new mace swung on her hip and it was easy to imagine her drawing it out and using it on him.

“Can we talk then?” he insisted. “About the other day? When you got wounded? I’m worried about you.” Her scars were still bright pink on her arm, the skin bunched together, like fabric not settling right. He saw how she struggled to make a fist sometimes.

Sil finally relented, slowed, and gave him a more patient answer. “Look, Vergil, I’m as anxious as you are. But you being here and bothering me is not going to help Tallah on her mission. You’re just making me antsy and I don’t like it.” She made a shooing motion and added her disquieting smile into the mix. “Go and drink your coffee, find a place to sit down and be quiet, and just wait. That’s all we can do.” She ignored the rest of his questions.

• *Grab the wee lass wi’h ‘he scary eye.*

• *She’d go fer a tumble, I bets.*

• *Or that elend whelp down below!*

Vergil blinked away the dwarf’s less-than-subtle ideas and nodded slowly. He wouldn’t leave things like this for long. A shadow had laid on Sil ever since she’d killed Erisa and she wasn’t speaking either to him or Tallah. But trying to wring more out of her here wasn’t likely to lead to anything but a mace to the ribs.

He found Arin waiting for him in the antechamber, two tin mugs in hand filled to the brim with the suspiciously-produced coffee. Vergil took one of the mugs and they stepped outside and away from the medical ward.

“I might be wired wrong,” he mused as they walked.

“I don’t know how you can be… wired,” Arin said, carefully. “Never heard that one.”

“Something from where I am. I have a moment to relax, when nothing’s happening, and instead of resting, I’m pacing and fretting. What’s wrong with me?”

Arin didn’t answer. Instead, he put his arm around Vergil’s shoulder and guided him away from the main road leading down into the city.

“Arin of Lorrat’s House!” a shrill voice called behind them. They stopped and turned. The scary girl was in the ward’s doorway, hard eyes pinning them from beneath a scowl that would make even Tallah proud. “You don’t bring back those mugs, and clean, I will personally make you eat them. Do you understand?”

Both Vergil and Arin looked at their mugs then back at the girl. They nodded gravely and she disappeared back inside with a huff.

“She is scarier than Sil,” Vergil finally said. Then he noticed that they were standing in the middle of the mud path, with people streaming past, forced to avoid them. “Where are we going?”

“Come, I’ll show you,” Arin said. His voice shook as he took a sip of the coffee. “She’s sewn me back together several times. She’s really nice once you get past the thorns.”

“Cactus flower and all that?”

“I’ve never heard of a cactus,” Arin said. “But Adella’s really nice when she’s not on duty. Likes beer. Tells lovely faer stories. She just doesn’t have a lot of patience, is all.”

I helped build [LucidRem](https://www.lucidrem.com/), a minimalist dream journal that actually does something with your dreams. Rem a free platform where you can record dreams, analyze them, browse what others are dreaming about, and join conversations. You can post privately or publicly, and it’s built to feel simple, comfortable, and a little more like a real place than a blank text box.

I wanted something that felt personal, but also social. Rem is a place for people who dream vividly, lucid dream, or just enjoy writing about their night mind.

Would love for you to try it out and tell me what’s working and what’s not. I'm still improving the design and features, so honest feedback is super welcome.

a man comes in today and orders a couple of drinks. he orders a flat white, a cappuccino, and a mocha. when we take people's orders here, we ask them if they know where they will be seated (tables are first come first serve) and this man was unsure, so we said okay and that we will come find him. he gets his first set of drinks, then comes to the front again and orders the pour over that retails at $17, but this time lets us know that he has found a seat outside. when ordering drinks ""for here,"" they are usually served in ceramics, EXCEPT for when people are seated outside. if a customer were to bring a ceramic cup outside, it's nbd, but when it's avoidable, we give in to go cups. 

the barista that makes the pour overs is separate from the baristas at the espresso machine as they focus on keeping up with the cold brews, hot brews, etc. mind you, it is extremely busy and we are all over the place, but the job is getting done and customers are satisfied up to this point. the pour over barista finishes the drink and serves it to him outside. 

it isn't until i head outside to make sure everything is okay that he stops me and goes, ""why the fuck did you guys give me all my drinks in ceramic cups except the expensive drink i pay for?"" at this point i freeze because im not sure what to do. i let him know that i am truly sorry and that i will be out with a ceramic cup for him, that is after i complete other tasks that were asked kindly by other customers. i'm confused because when serving pour overs, it is required to give a description on how the coffee is to be drank (it's given with a side of hot tea) and the history of the beans. if he had concerns with the cup, why not tell the barista who served the drink? not even a minute later, he walks back inside and yells at all of us, to the whole store, and goes 

""i pay 30 dollars for a coffee and you guys don't even give me in a ceramic cup? why do you guys do this???"" and then he proceeds to say, ""im waiting for the ceramic cup and now my coffee is getting cold"" and throws it on the counter where it spills all over the floor. i'm just like... if it's getting cold maybe ?? start??? drinking ??? it???? his drink was also NOT 30 dollars & he clearly wanted to cause a scene loud enough for other people to hear. 

he was a french tourist so idk if they do this stuff in france but im sorry to all the french baristas out there xx ",5,1745036227.0,retailhell,0,1.0,False
