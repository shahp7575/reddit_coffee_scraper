1p1vwtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hotels_India/comments/1p1vwtx/a_new_boutique_property_near_t2_mumbai_hotel/,A new boutique property near T2 Mumbai - Hotel Iconiqa a review,"My general use case in Mumbai is I stay for 3 days. Prefer a hotel that's near metro lines (esp Aqua as I have a few meetings in Nariman point), best T2 and also equally accessible to Bandra / Powai as I meet friends there in the evening. 

Till 2 years ago I used to book into the Leela (really really outdated rooms), J W or Grand Maratha but since then the later 2 have really upped prices and it's honestly (in my humble opinion) not worth spending 15-20k / room night for whats essentially used only to sleep in. I shifted my custom to the Fairfield Marriot. Lovely new small hotel, overlooks the runway (like literally) and works for me. 

Booking myself in for my trip in Nov, saw a new name, Iconiqa. Reviews seemed okay and I was like what the heck might as well give it a shot. 

Location - 700 M from T2 arrival if you walk, about 1.1 kms by auto (take an auto, it's faster. You get there in the time it takes you to wait for an uber / ola). It's also about 800 M from the Aqua line so that's a bonus. For me it's a 5/5. 

Check in - my flight landed at 1055, I requested that they complete my check-in process and allot my room whenever they can as I would only return by 6 pm. Check in was smooth, took me 5 mins total. Checked in my luggage and left. In the evening a room had been allotted and my suitcase moved into it. The guest service lady remembered me (nice touch) and said that rooms were done and suit case moved in. 

The room itself - small (but it's Mumbai so that's acceptable), clean. The bed is on the slightly firmer side , pillows too soft to my taste. The shower cubicle is big and the overall toilet tastefully done. I do have a major issue here though, the water pressure is not that great and the water will be tepid at best. 4/5 for the ambience etc but 2/5 on account of the other issues. 

The room has a 40 odd inch smart TV (hallelujah) and could login to my own apps and watch my tv. Rather than generic set top box nonsense. Why more hotels don't do this is beyond me. Including 5* marquees. 

The most interesting bit about the room is they have an LG steam closet. I thought it was just PR but it works of sorts. I put in my socks (along with my jacket, travel shirt etc), in 40 mins it was steam dried. The clothes were neatly pressed of sorts and it did get most of the odours including perfume smells out. You can't substitute it for a proper laundry but it definitely works. 


The view is.... interesting. Got a decent skyline view of sorts, can see the runway clearly but...cast your eyes down and there's a horrible nullah running below you. Not much the hotel can do about it guess. 

The window glazing is heavy and city noise didn't filter in. Not a bit. 

Breakfast - spread was so so. The usual South Indian continental combo that's de rigueur these days in India, taste was normal. Service was attentive but slow. Took them 15 mins to arrange ice for my water. One drawback here is that the coffee shop is tiny (by 5* or even 4* standards) and even at 0745 it was full. I had to sit outside, which in what passes for winter in Mumbai is okay but monsoons? Summer?

Their gym is functional (I only run in the treadmill anyway) and they have a small swimming pool that I didn't use so can't really comment. 

Overall I would 100% recommend this for anyone looking at a short stay / transit option. 

Since the property is new the team are 100% attentive to feedback, and they seem to even be overly staffed.

She was fun to talk to but in small doses specially when her kids were around. So I am like my dad who always helped the less fortunate and I am always helping people like when I don't need anything I give it away to the neighbors, Salvation Army and and homeless shelters.

This friend A and her 3 pushy aggressive demanding needy kids want to eat everything and anything at other people's houses. They will grab anything edible without asking for permission. As giving as I am I can't tolerate that kind of behavior.

These kids also has no respect for anyone and acts like they are entitled to everything, they took advantage off me when I told them that they can't help themselves to things in my house and they need to ask which was a big mistake because they were over almost everyday and asking for money things to eat or drink and to come swimming.

I started telling them no and they all screamed bloody murder while the mom looked on and seemed mad that they were denied things. She has money to smoke the most expensive cigarettes and buy alcohol and beers and wines. She could spend some on getting her kids snacks which she claims the kids wipe out in a day when she does buy it.

They moved out a year or so ago and it was such a relief. I saw them from time to time. Last Easter 🐣 which is also my close friend's son's birthday, she had a party at a park close by. My husband and I took our little kids there. We stopped by at a coffee shop and I got myself small chai latte. A was there with her kids, we exchanged some pleasantries and the oldest son 14 tries to hand me a solo cup,i said why are you giving this to me, he said I want some coffee. I said it's tea and I am not sharing it because it's a small drink that I was craving. He goes haywire and says didn't you think that I would want some and gotten a bigger drink? I was pissed and told him even if it was a large drink i would not share with someone so unappreciative.

I set my tea down at sometime to pick up my daughter. I went to get my cup it's not close to my side but it's clear across the table where this 14 yr old is standing. I loudly said how did my cup get there? He shrugged and another lady who I had never met told me that he picked it up and drank some. I was livid and took the cup and drained it on the ground and threw the cup in the trash can.

He starts screaming that I could have just given it to him instead. His mother (A) was scowling at me. We just decided to leave, no apologies nothing. So 3 days ago I get a call from A making small talk and then she asked me if they can move in with us into our new house with her kids? I told her no that it won't be a good idea then her 14 yr old monstrous child comes on to let them to stay at our home till they find a place for them to get. I kept saying no and that I would not be talking to him and to put his mom back on. She put the caller on speaker and the  kid just wouldn't shut his mouth and that how helpful they would be to us....I had to hang up and block their phone number.

They also called many of our other friends to ask the same and we're told no, they don't help at all and they are burdens to everyone else. They got evicted from their place because they had a filthy apartment and they had mice and roaches...",1,1763619520.0,EntitledPeople,0,1.0,False

One was a year ago and the other was just a few days ago (with a different doctor). In both cases, I didn’t like the results — my teeth still have that yellowish tone, and I want them to be fully white (without having to get veneers). Why does this happen?

The last doctor wanted me to book a second appointment and do the same thing again for a “whiter” look.

Carefully observe the fusion state when milk and coffee are merging.

Previous mistakes were due to pouring latte art before they were fused, resulting in milk and foam layers being too thin.

This caused the lines to be unclear and the color too light. You need to use the foam layer for distinct lines.

My first table was a really sweet older couple in their late 70s. Well-dressed, very polite, the kind of guests you’re happy to get. They ordered a dozen oysters to start. I put in the order and decided to go to the coffee station to get some water to start the night. My trainee was following me around with that “overwhelmed but trying to look calm” face.

When I walked back into the dining room, something felt off. I looked over and saw a huge guy, about 6 feet tall, standing behind my elderly lady guest, doing the Heimlich. She was choking. Her husband was frozen, eyes wide open. Then she coughed, the food came up, and she started breathing again.

The big guy checked if she was okay and calmly went back to his table like nothing had happened. It turned out he was a personal bodyguard for a very rich guest sitting about ten tables away. Pure luck he was sitting right next to the lady’s table.

I went over, checked on them, brought water, napkins, whatever they needed. I asked gently:  
Can I get you anything at all?

The husband reply: I’ll take a Manhattan.

I put in his Manhattan, we comped the oysters on the house, and tried to make the rest of their time as calm and comfortable as possible. After some time I went back to check the table. The gentleman downed his drink and asked for the check. He paid the bill, tipped on top of the 20%, and left.

My trainee just looked at me like, Is it always like this?  
I told her, Nah… sometimes it’s worse. See you tomorrow, right? LOL

.(T) 25 f single  and I 60 m widower have  been with her after 4 months several coffees ,breakfasts, clubs and movie dates, officially are bf,gf.  We have yet discussed long term relationship. She seems to e happy with that.  We haven't slept together . Nor had sex. Lots of holding and kissing.
I am semi retired she works full time . 
I told ( T) I was going fishing for a couple of days and we would go out when I get back. She said. She use to love fishing with her family when she was younger. If you are going alone can she come with me and fish? 
I had a big smile and said ok you can handle fish? YES, Can you clean and cook a fish
 YES, Can you bait your own hook ,YES,  Ok then would love to have you. She  gave a little squeal  and gave me a big hug. I said I'll pick you up in the morning around 8:00am. She said great I haven't camped in ages. I told her nope there is a nice State Park where we can rent a cabin for the night. That's even better she said.
 
I loaded my boat and picked (T) up the next morning. We chatted, and sang songs off the radio along the way. I was surprised she knew the words of some of the old songs. She told me yes my dad listen to this.
I looked at her out of the corner of my eye, smiled and shook my head a little. Her dad huh, I thought.
When we arrived I dropped  the boat at the dock and went to our cabin to unload and change cloths.  As I was changing (T) kept coming to the door. Knock knock...I have something to show you.. me,  show me when I come out..... knock knock,,  I have something to give you ,, ok when  I come out..I got my shoes on and came out and said what do you have for me. She had a pocket flash light, and 2 lures she gave me. I give her a light kiss and says thank you.

We went to the docks got in the boat and went to find a good spot.  We found one  dropped our line she  cast her lures ,I used live bait. 
In the first 15 mins. (T) catches 3 fish. An hour later I catch one she catches 3 more. 
She said I will bait your hook for luck. I laughed and looked at her smiling face. No thank you I am really an expert. She puts her hand up and says no.. don't say it. I don't want to hear you say your  a Master Baiter. I hate that old joke . My brother use to say that.  
 I brought my pole in and get a two beers out of the cooler and go set on.the padded  bench at the back of the boat.  I offered a beer to (T)  she puts my arm around her and opens her beer and leans on me. We chat and laugh as she rubs my thigh. She looks at me and says thank you for letting me come. You treat me like a lady, an adult and I feel I can be me without your judgement. I love you for that. I smiled the biggest smile and said I love you too (T). She kisses me. 
Then puts her beer down and straddles me. Gives me the biggest ,deepest, and longest kisses. We continue this for over 45 mins . She grinds into me and whispers I know you are aroused I can feel you against me. You want me don't you. I.put my hands on her hips to continue the grind. She says it again. I stopped her movement and said yes I'm a man I would be dead if I didn't. Just then she kisses me deeply again when a strong wind picks up. I look up and dark clouds start to move in. I said I need to get the boat back to the dock before he storm comes in. 
The temperature drops quickly as I tie the boat up (T) grabs the equipment and places them in the car. I get the net and empty the fish out of the live well and get into the car. 
When we get to the cabin the first bolt of lighting flashes across the sky  and the rain starts.  I told (T) to leave the gear and get into the cabin. I started a fire iin the fireplace and we can get out of these wet clothes. I start the fire and put on a pair of sweatpants  and Tee shirt. I sit on the couch and warmed up . (T) comes out in a pair of sweats also and a lap top.  I told (T) they have wi- fi here and pointed to the router. I go in the kitchen and fix some sandwiches and sodas  I brought for us while we dry. As I set down (T) lays in my laps looking at her computer and eating.. 
 
I said to her,
(T) we haven't slept together well except on your couch watching a movie. I'll give you the bed and 
 I 'll sleep out here.
She  looks up and says I'll sleep out here with you. I said there is no room. She  said I'll sleep on top of you then. I chuckled and said that's won't work. She said I came here to be with you that means sleep as well.  She get up and goes into the bedroom room makes a little noise and drags out the blanket and bedspread from the bed. She lays them on the floor infront off the fire place.She lays down there and opens her computer and starts a movie. I come down and lay next to her to watch the movie.  She said I brought an old movie. Inferno with Tom Hanks.
I said have you seen this before she said no. So 
 We laid down to watch.
About 50 mins. Into the movie (T) s rubbing my back her hand under my shirt the tactile touch of her hands against my skin issues so soothing. She whispers doesn't that feel good I answered uh huh. Would you like some more , of course I said. She climbs on my back and straddles me , she starts sliding my shirt up over my head and tells me to take it off. I did what she said.  Feeling of her hands just touching me is intoxicating. I am so relaxed enjoy the moment. Briefly I m thinking my wife never did this for me. She stops and set back on my hips. In a moment she throws her shirt in front of me, lay against me and kisses my neck . I. feel the warmth of her breasts against my back I see goose bumps forming on my arms. (T) wanted me to turn over on..my back..she. says she wants my lips . 
She briefly gets off me as I turn over. I lookbat her face in the light of the fiire. She climbs back on and my eyes immediately go to her breast . Lovely  smalll and firm  . I feel a twitch  in my crotch as she rubs her hands on my chest. She lays on.me and  kisses my chest , licking around my nipples lightly biting. I am so aroused.
I stopped her as my breathing quickens. I have these mixed feelings running through my mind. 
She asked me is something wrong did I do something wrong. I set up and hold her and said no it me I haven't had these feelings in so long it is overwhelming to 
My  senses.  We rock back and forth as we hold each other.
I whispered to her let's go to bed.. she squeezes me and says yes..  . We get up she holds my hand and leads me into the bedroom, we undress and pulls the cover over us..

Can I truly do this can I satisfy her. Will these 4.months end tonight . What am a I doing.

I m not going into detail. We made love including breaks till  5:am. Where she fell asleep on my chest. When I woke up at 10 am she was still on my arm holding it like she didn't want to let go..",0,1763618530.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,0.33,False

I could cry with how lovely he sounded, that he was glad to hear from me (he even said that too…) he was still so sweet and kind… he wants us to get coffee soon.

I know I shouldn’t have but I lost my mom a few weeks ago from cancer (I let him know that during our call…) and I’ve just been feeling so sad and depressed.. while at the same time relieved that she’s no longer in any pain and suffering, and reunited with my dad. It fucking sucks that both my parents are gone and I’m only 31. I feel like my safety nets are gone and I’m falling into the world all alone, I don’t know how I’m going to make it truthfully. I’m overly stressed about money and jobs and keeping the house… I’m truly terrified

My ex knew me better than anyone else, I could truly be myself, let loose, be a silly goose around him, unmask, and he was just as silly and sweet too. He did specific little thoughtful things that meant so much to me and that it touched my soul in a way it never has before. I miss our connection, that special feeling. I miss his affection too.. 6’5 with the best bear hugs :(

He was the only man that I dated that was respectful, a gentleman, affectionate, loving, gentle, calm. Unfortunately he checked out our relationship and cheated on me. He’s got childhood trauma that I don’t even think he sits and reflects on. 

This all happened in January, when my mom got diagnosed too, so it’s been such a shit year. Grief puts so much into perspective and death is so weird. One minute someone is here, the next they’re gone. 

I don’t want to go through life with regrets or to severe the connection.. I kept thinking what if I had lost the only person I could truly be myself around too. I had thought about reaching out for weeks and did it today. I don’t regret doing so but I’m not going to expect anything from him. But my heart has yearned for him still. I’ve done a lot of self reflection and healing and awareness since the no contact though..

So I (17F) have sbeen going to beauty school for the past 2 months. In our beauty school we have ""levels"" like freshmen, junior and senior. Im a freshmen, but Im supposed to level up next month.


Im incredibly overwhelmed. I go to school full time, 8:00 to 4:30. But I live an hour away, so to me its more like a 7:00-5:30. Which is fine. Its hard, and I wake up every morning at 6:15 AM on the verge of tears because Im tired. But I wake up and its ok. But still hard. (Compared to before, I was getting up at 11-12 PM sometimes even later)


Its the fact I am incredibly behind. I need more live models, I need to do my bookwork. And I dont have a lot of time to do bookwork, because I am so busy with maniquin work. Sincr Im supposed to level up next month. And I go home, and Im exhausted. But I dont get to relax. Sometimes I have to do even *more* bookwork. I have to shower, make lunch for Tommorow, clean my coffee cup. Eat. I just want to sit in my room and doomscroll on my phone. But I cant. Now its 10 PM, and I have to get up in 8 hours and 30 minutes. And I have yet to get my lunch ready, take a shower. Instead I spwnt most of my time in my phone because Im TIRED. And Im doing my bookwork now. Or supposed to do. Because I have a test on friday, and I wont have a lot of time tomorrow. 


I like my school! I like doing hair, even though most of it is maniquin work. But it's HARD. I wake up tired, I dont want to go to sleep because when I sleep ill have to wake up at 6 AM. And I desperately need more time to just... chill. Decompress. And my weekends arent long enough, I barely feel any form of relaxation.

Creatures come around and sniff and look at it.

Something will grow there one told me.

“Something more valuable than anything in the Universe.” a bird squawked.

…

The ""Neo-Advaita"" scene where people sit around drinking coffee, smiling vacantly, and saying, ""There is no me, and there is no coffee."" is spiritual dissociation. 

They are using non-duality as a bypass to avoid the pain of being human. They talk about the Abyss like it’s a vacation spot.

Those cupcakes can't handle the truth.

It ain’t bliss. 

It’s darkness and gnashing of teeth. 

Boo!

They haven't met the Minotaur and walked the maze; they've just read the brochure.

If you put up a sign that says ""DANGER: High Voltage,"" 99% of people will walk away.

The 1% who are already electrocuted, or who are so desperate they are willing to die to find the source, will climb the fence.

Mystics are aberrations. 

Mad clowns 🤡 

When the ""I AM"" realizes itself through a specific body/mind, that realization includes an impulse to express itself.

The Absolute enjoys the irony of using words to point to silence.

It is a cosmic joke, and the mystic is the punchline.

Farid ud-Din Attar writes: “If you don’t arrive with a wounded heart, the Beloved’s glance will pass over you… true lovers know each other by their scars.”

St. Teresa of Avila describes an angel piercing her heart with a fiery lance of love, leaving her “utterly consumed by the great love of God” a vision of blissful agony.

“To serve God in fear is good; to serve Him in love is better,” Eckhart said, “but he who is able to behold love in the midst of fear does best of all. A life of rest and peace in God is good; a life of pain in patience is still better; but to have peace in a life of pain is best of all.”  —Meister Eckhart

Hallaj the Sufi expressed the non-dual realization that only the One Reality exists, speaking from the merged perspective of the divine and the self. Yet this utterance was heard as blasphemy by the orthodox authorities, and it led to Hallaj’s imprisonment, torture, and execution. In Sufi lore, Hallaj had “divulged the secret that silenced al-Junayd and Ibn ‘Arabi”, breaking the esoteric code of silence.

He uttered ‘I am the Truth’ and opened a hole that could be closed only by his execution.

“This path will cost you everything.”

Turn back now. 

You don’t want to look into the Abyss really, do you?

You will have to make a terrible choice. 

It will be your end.

I couldn't help but pursue Being.

I’m a loon. 

When I was on the precipice of vision, I was shot through with an arrow of light and I died.

I don't regret this.

I died willingly.

I understand Gurdjieff's profound warnings now.

“Blessed is he who hath a soul, blessed is he who hath none, but woe and sorrow to him who hath it in conception.”

“Love has pierced with its arrow the heart of every lover. Blood flows but the wound is invisible.”

“The soul is satisfied now with nothing less than God.""

“Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receive the resurrection while they live, when they die they will receive nothing.”

--The Gospel of Philip

I had no thought of resurrection.

I will not speak of that. 

I was looking for no promise of any reward.

I accepted there was none, but yet said, I offer myself still, and that was the reason I was pierced I know.

Only then could the hunter hit its mark. 

“It is not possible for anyone to see the king unless he becomes the king.”

You realize how full of shit you are and how you have been bargaining and looking for an angle.

No more bargaining.

Only the soul that enters the Fire with no demand is pierced by the Fire.

Hallaj:

“Kill me, O my friends,
for in my being killed is my life.”

Eckhart:

“He who seeks God for reward seeks something of God, and not God Himself.”

There is no soul. 

I was dying, pierced through my mind and heart by a flaming sword and arrow.

I was in total darkness.

No hope of anything but to carry the pain of the wound.

I thought I was lost, but I was alone with the Alone.

You must willingly lay down the last hope of salvation, continuation, specialness.

The soul’s encounter with ultimate Reality can feel like being slain by a celestial arrow.

God was the archer and he hit right in the center of me.

The wound will remain open to forever remind me...God is hunting us...and I was his prey.

We shall feast on rabbit tonight!

YUM 😋 

And then, like a light switch, everything inside me was illuminated, all at once.

Now the wound is glowing.

Love ❤️ grows there now.

so my suggestion: scroll to centre the part of the counter you need while you're waiting for the transitions. i have an example here for any given drink:

1. drag portafilter to appropriate grinder
2. fetch cup while portafilter transitions to needing to control grinding amount
3. grind beans
4. scroll to centre the cup and grinder while portafilter transitions again
5. drag portafilter to coffee machine
6. scroll to centre the cup and milk while waiting for machine to transition / drag cup to the slot closest to steamer mug (provided you've dragged the portafilter closest to the steamer mug to the portafilter)
7. tap green button to start pouring
8. fill steamer cup with milk
9. tap green button to end pouring
10. drag cup to bench
11. scroll to centre steamer mug, cup with coffee and vanilla—choc syrups
12. drag steamer mug up to start airation
13. while airating, dispense the syrups (you will have enough time to do this for one cup provided the syrup is vanilla, strawberry or choc, even if the machine has been fully upgraded to max speed. lavender and pumpkin syrups need a bit more speed on your part but is still absolutely possible, i do this regularly)
14. drag steamer mug up fully to begin heating milk
15. wait or add another syrup
16. drag steamer mug down and then to the cup, do latte art
17. drag cup to centre cup in the middle of all needed toppings so you dont need to scroll to reach furthest ones / dont need to waste time on slowly dragging the cup to reach the furthest ones. dragging cup and falling short, then scrolling is quicker

1p1vdxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1p1vdxm/i_feel_taken_advantage_of_by_my_friend/,I feel taken advantage of by my friend.,"Lately I have felt quite disgruntled and kinda taken advantage of my best friend.
She has a lot of money issues, mainly that her income is not enough for all her bills. She does support her two elderly parents, which definitely contributes to financial issues, however she also in my opinion takes on unnecessary costs and isn't super smart with her money. 
For example, she struggled with paying bills in the past, but in the last few years, she has taken on two car loans, and student loans. 
One of my frustrations with her is that I buy her stuff all the time, not that she asks me to (gift giving is my love language), and I don't necessarily expect anything in return, but anytime I do get anything in return it pales in comparison. For example, I will spoil her on Christmas, sometimes spend well over $100, and she will get me a $5 bath set. 
Which is fine, whatever, I get it she's broke.
The other issue I have though, is sometimes she does ask to borrow money. And she's usually pretty good about paying me back, but the last few times she hasn't. 
There was one time I let her $40; she didn't ask me for it, but she was telling me about a bill she was short on, so I offered to lend her the money. 
She never sent it back. I chalked it up to, she's busy, and she didn't ask me I offered, so she just forgot about it. 
And then again recently, I let her $25 at her request. She clearly said when I lent it to her ""you know I'm good for it"".
I mentioned her one day that she hadn't sent it back, and she looked confused and said that she was pretty sure she sent it. 
I have double checked, gone through my whole banking, and I never received either amounts back.
That in itself makes me feel taken advantage of. The other part is that, she knows I will lend her money, she knows I have more money than her, and she knows I like spoiling people.. 
And I have also said to her in the past that I easily forget when people owe me money and she could just not tell me and I wouldn't know any different.
And she is always talking about how broke she is, or how she can't pay a bill, or how she has to ask her parents put gas in her car, so I feel bad asking for money back when she has none. So I end up just letting it slide.
All of these things together have me worried that she's taking advantage of me. I don't want to think that, she's been good friend for many years, and part of me thinks it's just stress, she has a lot going on, she's just as forgetful. But the other part of me worries that I've said an done too much and now, she knows if she says nothing I'll forget, or that if she says ""I wish I had money for coffee"" I'll offer to buy coffee..
I'm not completely broke but I'm not raking in cash either.
I know I'm just as responsible if I am being taken advantage of because I let things slide. ",1,1763617731.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

There's a lot of layers here. A while ago, I sorta planned a vacation with my high school friends. At the time, I was about to graduate from university, and when I told my university friend group (lets call them friend1 , friend 2, and friend 3 lol) about my possible upcoming trip, friend 3 revealed that their parents own a property at that same place. Then the group said we should do a graduation trip. I politely told them that I couldn't afford 2 vacations, and would be sticking with my main plan. It kinda rubbed me the wrong way that my friend revealed the beach house only after I told them about my plan. 

I graduated and neglected to look for a job cause I wanted to chill until the trip and then get serious about job hunting. Time goes by, and my high school group goes radio silent about our vacation. I started using my savings for my day-to-day activities, including the money I had reserved for the trip. During this time, I told everyone who asked that I wasn't working yet cause I had a vacation coming up. At this time, I started to feel depressed cause it became obvious to me that I was stalling and had lost time making excuses instead of working on building my career- one of those excuses being this now nonexistent vacation. I was barely leaving my house. I didn't want to see anyone cause I felt like I had nothing going for me, nothing new or interesting to say. 

A few days after that, I gathered the strength to go out with my uni friends (1 and 2)(3 couldn't attend). Friend 1 picked me up, and I yapped for 15 minutes about my doubts and fears for the future, but also about hope and working on my mental health. Initially, it felt great, like I was crawling out of the hole I had dug. Sadly, that feeling didn't last; once we were dining, they suddenly started grilling me about my vacation. It felt very aggressive. *""Are you even going?"" ""You should have bought the plane tickets already."" ""It's too late, everything is going to be super expensive."" ""Do your friends even have their PTO approved?"" ""Why did you even plan a vacation at the time of our graduation? This should be our graduation trip!"" ""We're clearly at the bottom of your priorities.""* I thought to myself, ""I should have stayed home"". I was bummed out. But still tried to hide it and did my best to answer to keep the peace, I admitted that it could very well get cancelled, I said something like ""Yeah, maybe we're not going. I dunno"". Then they responded with a *""Well, we are going in November""* like it was a grand reveal. The mood changed, and I got quiet. I didn't care, but the way they said it stung, especially after berating me with doubts about my own plans. WE ARE GOING. It was also a clear sign that they had made another group chat and had been using it for a while. After all of that they said ""*If that plan falls through, you're more than welcome to join us. Just make up your mind soon, we're buying the tickets this weekend.""* I got quiet and then they switched to saying they were hurt I didn't want to join this graduation trip cause it would be the perfect way to end our uni days. That they cared for me and that's why they wanted me to share my time with them. 

The mood changed, but I held it together until the end of the function. I got home, and this immense sadness took over me. Cried for an hour while venting in my journal. I thought seeing my friends would lift my spirit, but I felt humiliated instead. At that point, I lost all interest in joining them, even if I somehow gathered the funds for it. 

I talked with my HS friends and we scrapped the whole thing. For the upcoming year, maybe. After that disastrous reunion, I actively went silent with my uni friends. Friend 1 started to suspect they were too intense cause they kept messaging me about anything for a week. I didn't reply to any of those messages. Friend 2 didn't contact me at all. And I felt like venting, so I told friend 3 about the whole thing. Friend 3 is the most sensitive, I would say. That's also why I trusted them. We talked, and I decided to confess to friend 1 how their comments made me feel. All 4 of us went out, and friend 1 gave me a small gift and apologized. Friend 2 remained clueless about all of this. 

The problem was solved at this point. I made peace with having no vacation and my uni friends going on theirs. Water under the bridge.... UNTIL.

I went for coffee with friend 3, and they told me what days they would be out of town for the vacation. The twist? out of all the days in the fucking month, they chose the week of my birthday. It's worth mentioning that none of them need PTO. One is self-employed, one works with their family, and one works remotely and would be doing so from the beach. I didn't say anything at the time. But in a conversation with my family about my celebration with friend 3 present, they said ""Yess, let's get 2 cakes"" and I said ""You're not even going to be here for it"" and that's when they realized. After this, on different occasions, friend 1 and friend 3 told me I could still join them. But I declined. 

Felt terrible then, but whatevs I thought. I guess the news made it to group chat 2, cause suddenly friend 1 and friend 2 were eager to plan something with me the weekend before leaving. I made excuses and didn't see them. 

They went away for their trip. I chose to silence their stories and posts for my peace of mind. The day of my birthday came, and I woke up feeling gloomy and sad. I could see it in my own reflection too. Watery eyes at the thought of them. Friend 3 sent me a happy birthday text at 00:01, friends 1 and 2 also did during the afternoon. I ignored them cause the tears and sadness were resurfacing. I replied to friend 3 at 11 pm with the explanation of my silence. I made sure to mention that this infamous taking place on my birthday felt like a slap to the face, and made me relive the dinner fight. Friend 3 apologized and said they felt sorry for the way this unfolded for me, that they suspected I might be sad, and that they understood if I needed my time.

Today marks a week since then. Friend 3 told me they accidentally revealed to the other friends that I only replied to them, but lied about my detailed response and said I was busy and just said thanks, and that's why I didn't also thank them. Friend 1 messaged me a few times, but I remained silent (deja vu lol). I was planning on just saying ""Thanks"" and dealing with my motions privately. But they just got back, and now friend 2 is also asking me if I'm ok, so saying nothing feels weird now. But bringing it up feels like overreacting. 

I talked to my mom, and she said I should have just gone with them with borrowed money from her and buried my pride. But I reminded her it wasn't about the trip, I was ok about missing the trip. The problem was why out of all of the days in the month they chose my birthday? and she agreeed with me on that.

They're pressing me for answers,15 messages and a missed call from friend 1 and 5 texts from friend 2. I dont know If I should just invent some bs excuse, say nothing but thanks, or really tell them how terrible they made me feel. I know for sure all of them would've given me crap if the roles were reversed.

1p1vcho,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1p1vcho/how_much_does_nordvpn_cost/,How Much Does NordVPN Cost?,"NordVPN costs between $2.99 and $16.59 per month, depending on which plan and subscription length you choose. The cheapest option is the 2-year Basic plan at $2.99/month, while the most expensive is the monthly Prime plan at $16.59/month.

With four different plan tiers and three subscription lengths, NordVPN's pricing can feel confusing at first glance. This guide breaks down exactly what you'll pay, what's included in each plan, and how to get the best deal in November 2025.

# NordVPN Pricing Overview: All Plans at a Glance

NordVPN offers four subscription tiers: Basic, Plus, Complete (or Ultimate in some regions), and Prime. Each tier is available with three different commitment periods: monthly, 1-year, or 2-year subscriptions.

# 2-Year Plans (Best Value)

All two-year plans currently include 3 extra months of protection for free as part of Black Friday 2025 promotions, with discounts up to 73% off.

* **Basic**: $2.99/month ($80.73 total for 27 months)
* **Plus**: $3.89/month ($105.03 total for 27 months)
* **Complete**: $4.99/month (varies by region)
* **Prime**: $6.99/month (US only)

# 1-Year Plans

* **Basic**: $4.59/month ($68.85 total)
* **Plus**: $5.49/month ($82.35 total)
* **Complete**: Varies by region
* **Prime**: Available in US only

# Monthly Plans (Most Expensive)

Monthly subscriptions cost between $12.99 and $16.59 per month, depending on the plan tier. These don't require long-term commitment but cost significantly more over time.

* **Basic**: $12.99/month
* **Plus**: $13.99/month
* **Complete**: $14.99/month
* **Prime**: $16.59/month

# What's Included in Each NordVPN Plan?

All NordVPN plans share the same core VPN features, but higher tiers add extra security and productivity tools.

# NordVPN Basic ($2.99-$12.99/month)

The Basic plan gives you access to 10 simultaneous device connections and all of NordVPN's essential VPN features. This includes:

* Protection for up to 10 devices
* Access to 7,200+ servers in 118+ countries
* Unlimited bandwidth and data
* Industry-standard encryption and security protocols
* Kill switch and leak protection
* 24/7 customer support
* Basic Threat Protection (ad and malicious domain blocking)

**Best for**: Users who only need VPN protection without additional security tools.

# NordVPN Plus ($3.89-$13.99/month)

The Plus plan adds Threat Protection Pro (malware protection, ad blocking, and tracker blocking), along with NordPass password manager and Data Breach Scanner.

Everything in Basic, plus:

* **Threat Protection Pro**: Advanced malware and tracker blocking
* **NordPass**: Cross-platform password manager
* **Data Breach Scanner**: Monitors if your credentials are compromised

**Best for**: Most users who want the sweet spot of useful extra features and affordable pricing.

# NordVPN Complete ($4.99-$14.99/month)

Everything in Plus, plus:

* 1 TB of encrypted cloud storage (NordLocker)

**Best for**: Users who need secure cloud storage alongside VPN protection.

# NordVPN Prime ($6.99-$16.59/month)

Only available for US users at the time of writing. Everything in Complete, plus:

* NordProtect identity theft protection service with up to $1 million in coverage

**Best for**: Users who want comprehensive digital security and identity protection.

# Which NordVPN Plan Should You Choose?

The right plan depends on your needs and budget:

**If you only need a VPN**: The Basic plan covers all essential VPN features without extras you won't use.

**If you want well-rounded protection**: The Plus plan is recommended for most users, as it costs about $1 more than Basic but includes NordPass password manager, which alone costs $1.39/month as a standalone service.

**If you need cloud storage**: The Complete plan makes sense if you'd otherwise pay separately for secure cloud storage.

**If you want maximum protection**: Prime offers comprehensive security but only if you're in the US and willing to pay premium pricing.

# How to Save Money on NordVPN

# 1. Choose Longer Subscription Periods

Switching to a yearly plan cuts your average monthly price down to nearly a third of the standard monthly rate, with two-year plans offering savings of more than 60% compared to paying monthly.

**Example**: The Basic plan costs $12.99/month on a monthly subscription but drops to $2.99/month on a 2-year plan—that's $360 per year vs $80 for two years.

# 2. Take Advantage of Current Promotions

With Black Friday 2025 promotions, all two-year plans include 3 extra months free, bringing the actual monthly cost even lower.

# 3. Look for Special Discount Codes

NordVPN partners with digital creators and influencers who share special promotional codes with their audiences, often matching official campaigns but with extra free months or bundles.

# 4. Student Discounts

NordVPN offers a student discount for those enrolled in school or university, which reduces the price of long-term plans.

# 5. Consider Bundle Value

Choosing a bundle like the Complete or Plus plans can save money if you need extras such as NordPass and NordLocker, which would be more expensive if purchased separately.

# NordVPN vs Competitors: Price Comparison

# How Does NordVPN Stack Up?

**NordVPN** (2-year Basic): $2.99/month **Surfshark** (2-year plan): $2.19/month with unlimited devices **ExpressVPN** (12-month plan): \~$6.67/month **CyberGhost** (2-year plan): $2.11/month

NordVPN's main limitation compared to some competitors is that it only allows 10 simultaneous device connections, while services like Surfshark and Private Internet Access offer unlimited connections, usually at lower prices per month.

However, NordVPN's pricing is competitive for what it offers, especially when you factor in the quality of service, server network size, and additional features in the Plus and Complete plans.

# Payment Methods & Money-Back Guarantee

# How Can You Pay?

NordVPN accepts major credit/debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), and regional payment methods.

# Is There a Free Trial?

While NordVPN doesn't offer a traditional ongoing free plan, all plans include a 30-day money-back guarantee, allowing you to try the service risk-free. You have a full month to test it and request a refund if it doesn't meet your needs.

# Can You Buy NordVPN at Retail Stores?

Yes, you can purchase NordVPN from retailers like Best Buy and Target if you prefer paying in cash for additional anonymity. However, prices may vary for physical products—NordVPN typically costs less when ordered directly from their website with special deals.

# Hidden Costs & Renewal Prices

# What Happens When Your Subscription Renews?

One important consideration: promotional pricing typically applies only to your first subscription period. When your plan renews, you'll pay the regular (higher) renewal rate unless you lock in another promotional deal.

**Pro tip**: Set a calendar reminder before your renewal date to check for new promotional offers. You can often contact customer support to apply a current deal to your renewal.

# Are There Any Hidden Fees?

No. The price you see is what you pay—there are no hidden activation fees, equipment rental charges, or surprise costs. Your subscription covers everything listed in your chosen plan.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Is NordVPN worth the cost?**

For most users, yes. NordVPN offers robust security, fast speeds, and a large server network at competitive pricing, especially on 2-year plans. The Plus plan offers particularly good value with its included password manager.

**Can I change plans after subscribing?**

Yes, you can upgrade to a higher tier at any time by paying for the difference, which extends your current subscription. To downgrade, you'll need to cancel your current subscription and purchase a new one.

**Does NordVPN have a completely free option?**

No, NordVPN doesn't offer a free tier. However, the 30-day money-back guarantee lets you test the service risk-free.

**How does the upfront payment work for long-term plans?**

If you choose a two-year plan, you must pay for the entire period upfront. For example, the 2-year Basic plan costs $80.73 total, paid immediately, which breaks down to $2.99/month.

**Which plan do most people choose?**

The Plus plan is considered the sweet spot, hitting the balance between useful extra features and affordable pricing. It's the most popular choice for users who want more than just basic VPN protection.

# Bottom Line: What Should You Pay?

**For most people**: The 2-year Plus plan at $3.89/month offers the best combination of value, features, and commitment length. You get excellent VPN protection, malware blocking, and a password manager for less than the cost of a coffee.

**If budget is tight**: The 2-year Basic plan at $2.99/month provides solid VPN protection without extras.

**If you're unsure about long-term commitment**: Start with the 1-year Plus plan to test the service with a reasonable commitment, then lock in a 2-year deal when it renews.

**If you only need short-term access**: The monthly plan works for temporary needs like travel, but expect to pay 4x more per month.

Whatever you choose, take advantage of the 30-day money-back guarantee to ensure NordVPN meets your needs before you're fully committed.

""Is that so? Aww, puppy, you're so adorable, you didn't want me to get more stressed because of you? That's so precious, I'm glad you were looking out for me. But I want to look out for you, too. You'll make me feel like I'm not putting in enough work in our relationship.""

Granted, people may not hear you because of the music, that's true. But I know you, and you know you. The excitement of you being in your most vulnerable state around so many people may just. Make you melt, in a sense. May make you what's the word.. Needy? Now that may not be true, however. I also know that people are too distracted, and there's not much light in this corner. So I don't think they'd notice me slowly moving my hips along you now, would they?""

""Mhm, so be a good boy and enlighten me, what did you say?""

**\[Pause\]**

""Oh, is that true? Me being yours is enough for you? My, my, what a sweet talker. Why was that so hard to say? Does the fear of prying eyes scare you that much? It's okay, puppy, I'm here for you. Nothing is going to happen to you with me around, well. Nothing you wouldn't enjoy anyway.""

*\*Soft laughter\**

""Why are you so red, darling? Something on your mind? Maybe, someone?""

**\[Pause\]**

""What? I'm not cheating, well, maybe I am a little. It has been a while since I've been on top of you like this, and maybe seeing you all shy and red beneath me while you hold my hip, unable to resist the urge to move them up and down my curves. You're teasing me, too, you know. You can't get mad at me when you're doing essentially the same thing to me in your own, adorable way.""

**\[Pause\]**

""Shh, it's okay, no one's looking. Surprisingly, everyone is either too drunk or too busy trying to get lucky to pay attention. So, stop worrying about everyone else and just focus on me. Listen to your heart pound in your chest, feel my body heat radiate against you. My breath is getting warmer and warmer as I get closer and closer to you. Before you can focus and feel on nothing. But my lips, against yours.""

*\*Soft kisses\**

""Shh, you're doing a good job of following the rules. But quiet down, puppy.""

*\*Whispers into the listener's ear\**

""Because if you listen well enough, you can hear me make my own noises too.""

*\*Soft laughter into kisses\**

""You know, you're always on my mind. But after that day, I couldn't seem to spend a single second not thinking about you. The night we had after I figured out the extent of the noises you could make was one of my favourite nights I've ever had.""

**\[Pause\]**

""Yes, really. Not only did you sound amazing, but you felt amazing. It honestly felt like the world was against me when we suddenly got so busy. Figuring out you could make those adorable noises, and then you were pulled away from me like that. God, I couldn't stop thinking about you.""

**\[Pause\]**

*\*Soft Laughter\**

""No, I'm not kidding, love you are the most important thing to me. The most important thing in my life, from you being disrespected at that stupid party to where we are now. You seem happier, calmer. More shy, which is what I personally love. To top it all off, you just get more and more addicted to me. The more time we spend together, the more time we spend apart. It just makes me crave you more.""

*\*Soft kisses\**

""Umm, haha. I know I said I wanted to spend time with you at this party to be able to see each other again and be able to take a much-needed break. But, do you want to go and have some fun of our own?""

**\[Pause\]**

""Where? Well, I mean, your car is outside.. We could take that somewhere if you want?""

**\[Pause\]**

""Yeah? Good answer.""

*\*Soft kisses\**

""I wonder if you're able to follow the rules in the confined space of your backseat.""

*\*Soft laughter into kisses\**

""Okay, puppy. Be a good boy for your mistress and follow me..""

Tips for Navigating Kohl's Black Friday Shopping Experience
-----------------------------------------------------------

As Black Friday approaches, shoppers everywhere prepare for the frenzy of holiday deals. If you're planning to shop at Kohl’s this Black Friday, it’s vital to navigate the experience strategically. With so many deals and crowds, having a plan can make your shopping more efficient and enjoyable.

Start by researching Kohl’s Black Friday ad. Typically released a few weeks before the event, these ads detail the special promotions and discounts you can expect. Take the time to review which items are on sale and prioritize your shopping list based on what you really want. This prevents impulse buying and allows you to focus on deals that matter most to you.

https://itrendworld.com/kohls-black-friday/  
  
Another essential tip is to leverage the Kohl’s app. The app often provides exclusive discounts, adding to the savings you will encounter in-store. You can also check current promotions and track your Kohls Cash, which is crucial during the holiday season. Sign up for notifications to receive alerts on your favorite items, ensuring you don't miss out on any fantastic deals.

The early bird gets the worm! Planning to shop early on Black Friday can help you beat the rush. Stores typically open early in the morning, so arriving as soon as the doors open gives you a better chance to grab the best items before they sell out. The atmosphere can be chaotic, but getting there ahead of time allows you to navigate the aisles with less competition.

https://itrendworld.com/kohls-black-friday/  
  
Consider shopping online as an alternative. For those who want to avoid the long lines and crowded aisles, Kohl’s online store is a convenient option. You can shop from the comfort of your home, and many of the same deals available in stores will also be online. Plus, if you're worried about items being out of stock, online shopping gives you a chance to buy quickly without the rush.

Don’t forget about Kohl’s Cash! Kohl’s often runs promotions where, for every $50 you spend, you earn $10 in Kohl's Cash valid for future purchases. This can be a great way to save more money during the holiday season. Keep track of your earned Kohl’s Cash, as it can be used on your next shopping spree. Just remember to check the expiration dates so you don’t miss out!

https://itrendworld.com/kohls-black-friday/  
  
While you’re shopping, stay organized. Bring a shopping list and a pen to mark off items as you go. This will prevent you from forgetting any gifts and help you stick to your budget. Also, don’t hesitate to ask store associates for help. They can guide you directly to the items on your list, making your shopping experience smoother and more efficient.

When shopping in-store, keep an eye on your surroundings. With multiple shoppers vying for the same deals, it can get a bit wild. Stay calm and focused; remember that patience can go a long way. If you see an item you want, grab it when you can, but always be respectful to other shoppers. Sharing the space helps keep the atmosphere friendly during this busy time.

https://itrendworld.com/kohls-black-friday/  
  
Be prepared for checkout delays. Black Friday can lead to longer wait times at registers, so budget some extra time for checkout. Ensure you have your payment method ready, whether it be a credit card, Kohl's gift card, or even cash. If you plan to use coupons or apply Kohl's Cash, have those ready too!

If you think of gift wrapping or other services, check with Kohl’s. Some locations offer gift wrap services during the holiday season. This can save you time and effort at home, allowing you to feel more prepared for the holidays.

https://itrendworld.com/kohls-black-friday/  
  
By following these tips for navigating Kohl’s Black Friday shopping experience, you can maximize your savings and enjoyment during this exciting time. With a little preparation and the right mindset, your shopping day can be not just effective, but truly fun. Get ready and happy shopping!

### Conclusion

As you gear up for this year's Kohl's Black Friday event, remember that the best deals are often found in several categories, from home goods to fashion items. Focus on the key products you want, like cozy sweaters or popular kitchen gadgets, and don’t forget to check for exclusive discounts and Kohl's Cash promotions.

Navigating the busy shopping atmosphere of Kohl's on Black Friday can feel daunting, but being prepared can make all the difference. Arriving early can help you snag the best deals before they're gone. Be sure to come with a clear list to avoid overspending on items that may not be on your wish list.

1p1v1kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Gensact/comments/1p1v1kl/top_android_app_development_services_for/,Top Android App Development Services for User-Centric Apps,"Ever opened a new app and felt that ""wow, this app gets me"" feeling? Or have you used an app that felt so easy and natural that you wondered how it was made? Most of the time, it is because the app was built with the user in mind. Today, people uninstall apps in seconds if the experience feels confusing or slow. That’s why successful Android app development is all about making the user feel seen and understood.

The Best Services Focus on Deep User Needs  
So what are the top Android app development services that actually put the user first? The best services today focus on three big things: Deep User Research, Intuitive Design, and Agile, High-Performance Development.

Top services don't just write code; they become User Experience (UX) architects. They start every project by talking to actual users (not just the client) to uncover real problems and habits. This focus on user-centric design is non-negotiable. They use modern tools like Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Firebase to make apps feel instant, personal, and smooth. The goal is to make the app feel so natural that users enjoy using it every single day.  
These services also help businesses grow by delivering a frictionless experience. For example, a shopping app with a neat layout and quick checkout can increase sales. A fitness app with smart reminders and easy tracking can build strong daily habits. When developers design with users first, apps become more useful, more trusted, and ultimately more successful in the long run.

**Insights**

**Why User-Centric Design Matters**

If an app is hard to use, users leave quickly. A user-first approach keeps the experience smooth, which is critical for growth and staying competitive in the crowded app market. When an app feels made for YOU, people open it 5 to 10 times more often. Happy users tell friends, leave five-star reviews, and spend more time inside the app.

**How the Best App Development Teams Work**

The best teams begin with coffee chats and sticky notes, not code. They study user behavior and test simple designs to understand what feels natural. They build features that help users complete tasks faster, like quick search or one-tap actions. This iterative development ensures that the final product, whether built for GEO specific needs or SEO optimisation, is truly what the users want, not just what the developers thought they wanted.

**A Real-World Perspective**

Think of a food delivery app that saves your past orders or a music app like Spotify whose home screen changes based on what you listen to. Both are Android apps built by teams obsessed with ""how does this feel at 7 am on the bus?"" These companies focus on little delights, making the experience easy and almost joyful. That is user-centric design in action.

**Simple Fact**

Apps with great user-centric design have up to 200% higher retention after 30 days (according to Google's own studies). A boring app gets deleted in three days. This proves that a strong, positive first impression driven by smart app development is absolutely essential.

**Micro Takeaway**

Great Android apps don’t just work; they feel like they were made only for you.  
Smart businesses choose app development services that help them build Android apps users love to use.

**Discussion Question**

What is the one feature you think every Android app should have to stay user-friendly?

**About Gensact**

Gensact is a premier consulting firm specialising in Android app development that places the user at the heart of the process. We start with in-depth audience research to define clear user needs and then apply the best of modern design principles to create intuitive, fast, and highly secure applications.

1p1uz0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaTea/comments/1p1uz0v/the_az_of_tea_caffeine_and_chemistry/,⚗️ The A–Z of Tea : Caffeine and Chemistry,"Tea feels gentle, soothing, and comforting…

yet it sharpens focus and clears the mind.

How does one plant create both calmness and alertness at the same time?  
The answer lies in caffeine and chemistry.

# 🔋 Caffeine in Tea — Not What Most People Think

Tea contains caffeine, but **not like coffee**.

|Drink|Typical Caffeine per Cup|
|:-|:-|
|**Coffee**|90 – 110 mg|
|**Tea (average)**|20 – 60 mg|
|**Matcha**|30 – 80 mg|
|**Herbal / Tisanes**|0 mg|

But the effect is not only about **how much caffeine**, it is about **how caffeine behaves**.

# 🧘‍♂️ L-Theanine — The Calm That Balances Caffeine

Tea contains an amino acid called **L-theanine**.  
It crosses the blood–brain barrier and promotes:

* relaxation
* mental clarity
* reduction of stress hormones
* alpha brainwave activity (calm focus)

This is why tea gives **smooth, steady alertness** rather than coffee’s **spike and crash**.

>L-theanine is present in tea, but only in modest amounts. I**ts effects are gentle, not dramatic.** Research shows it can support mild relaxation and slightly soften the sharper edge of caffeine, giving tea a **smoother, steadier alertness** rather than a big “calm and energy” effect.

# 🍃 Which Tea Has the Most Caffeine?

Tea chemistry is complicated.  
You cannot look at leaf color to guess caffeine.

General pattern:

|Higher Caffeine|Lower Caffeine|
|:-|:-|
|Buds and first leaves|Older leaves|
|Shade-grown teas|Sun-grown teas|
|Spring flush|Autumn flush|
|Matcha|Brewed green tea|

So **white tea is not always low caffeine**  that is a common myth.  
Young white teas made from buds can be **very high in caffeine**.

# 🔥 Processing and Caffeine Release

Caffeine **is already present in the leaf**.  
Processing does not change how much caffeine the leaf contains, but it affects **how fast caffeine moves into water**.

|Tea Type|Rate of Caffeine Release|
|:-|:-|
|**Green and Yellow**|Fast release|
|**Black and Dark**|Gradual release|
|**Oolong**|Slow and rounded release|

This is why green tea can feel **sharp and buzzy** if brewed too hot,  
while oolong feels **softer and longer lasting**.

# 🧪 Other Flavor and Body Compounds

Tea chemistry is not only caffeine and L-theanine.  
Here are the major players:

|Compound|Contribution|
|:-|:-|
|**Catechins**|Astringency and antioxidant activity|
|**Theaflavins**|Brightness and strength in black tea|
|**Thearubigins**|Depth and body in black tea|
|**Polyphenols**|Overall taste complexity|
|**Essential oils**|Aroma and aftertaste|

They interact differently depending on how the tea is processed.",1,1763616330.0,IndiaTea,0,1.0,False

Nalimutan ko na, basta for a local coffee shop. Simple lang naman dapat: deliver three initial design concepts.

Pero ewan ko ba, na-pressure akong patunayan na worth it ako, so lumampas ako nang todo sa scope. Hindi lang ako nag-sketch ng ilang options—nag-deliver ako ng five fully developed concepts. From a three-concept brief, ginawa kong parang full design buffet na pang-sampler lang ang bayad.

Pag-send ko, doon ko narealize na classic rookie mistake ’yun: overdeliver to the point na nawawala na yung profit margin mo.

Tapos biglang tumawag si client, super energetic pa. Sabi nila hirap daw sila with previous designers kasi hindi nila ma-visualize yung options, and yung “sobrang dami” kong concepts finally helped them articulate what they actually wanted. Translation: na-solve ko problema nila, pero at my expense.

Thrilled sila. Ako naman, nasa likod ng utak ko iniisip: okay, masaya kayo... pero sana next time proportionate rin ang bayad sa amount of work na binuhos ko.

Hindi ko na uulitin ’yun. Three concepts is the boundary. Anything beyond that, paid add-on na or higher-tier package. Overdelivery works once in a while, pero hindi kung nagiging unpaid labor na naka-costume na “extra effort.”

No one informed us that lymphedema was a possible side effect of radiation. If we knew that it was, and what having lymphedema was like, we might have thought twice about radiation. (In my mom's case, radiation was recommended just to ease pain, not necessarily to treat the cancer.)

I'm very surprised that the radiologist never mentioned anything about lymphedema. She told us that a quick 5 rounds of radiation would be a walk in the park, no need to worry about anything, e.i. burns, side effects, etc. Maybe a little diarrhea, due to radiating the pelvis. When we asked about burns, she said we wouldn't need to worry.

Unfortunately my mom's experience with radiation was not at all a walk in the park. It caused horrendous nausea, she did wind up with a pretty bad burn right on her tailbone (ouch!!) but worst of all, a chronic swelling which has reduced her mobility to almost zero.

At least before lymphedema, she could walk a little bit, using a cane or walker. She could at least get to the kitchen and make a coffee. Now, she's completely bedridden and needs a wheelchair at all times. Not to mention, she can't even keep her feet down for more than 20 minutes. 

We finally got an appointment with a lymphedema specialist, coming up this week. That was not easy by the way, and all the specialists in our area are always booked out for weeks!

Would love to hear if anyone has any suggestions or experience with this. I'm lowkey kind of mad at the radiologist, but I don't want to approach the situation that way... I did let her team know, and they basically said just find a specialist! 🙄",3,1763616306.0,breastcancer,8,1.0,False

I usually add my collagen powder to my morning coffee, and it mixes pretty smoothly without affecting the taste much. At first, I was worried that the heat would reduce its benefits, but hydrolyzed collagen is generally heat-stable, so it holds up fine in normal coffee or tea temperatures.

I just avoid boiling it directly and simply stir it in after the drink is ready. For me, adding it to coffee has been the easiest way to stay consistent because I never forget my morning cup. It’s a simple routine change that actually helps me take it daily without feeling like I'm forcing a supplement into my schedule.

I finally hit my limit this year and decided I was going to quit for good, cold turkey. I knew it was the only way I’d be able to kick the habit permanently. Here’s how I did it successfully:

-In the very beginning (first 1-2 weeks), I irrigate my sinuses twice a day, once in the AM, once in the PM. 
-At night I use a handheld humidifier/facial steamer with a mask with a menthol pad. 
-I use saline twice a day, once in the AM before work, once in the PM before bed.
-I temporarily increase my Zyrtec intake to two pills daily (this is short term). 
-I cut out all cow dairy and switched to a milk alternative for tea and coffee (if I really want cheese, I ate only sheep or goats milk cheese).
-I use a magnetic nasal bridge device that is more effective than strips. 
-I cut out nightshades and inflammatory foods, as well as corn and wheat (you may not need to do this, but it certainly helped my recovery 10,000%).
-I increase my water intake drastically (I already drink a lot of water, but I doubled that amount over a 24 hour period.

I still use the irrigator a couple times a week and use the saline, humidifier, and nasal bridge magnet every night. I also haven’t reintegrated inflammatory foods into my diet yet. I’m not craving them and manage fine without them.

For context,I barely ​go out ​​ like twice a month max and even then, we’re all busy adults so our schedules only match at night. And we’re not doing anything wild. We literally just eat, get coffee, and catch up. My friends are responsible, successful people, and we don’t party or flirt or get wasted. It’s chill.

I​ was actually having a good time for once… until my dad messaged me asking what time I’d be home. I said maybe around 12AM. Suddenly he tells me NO, I have to be home before 10PM. And then he starts spam-texting.

S​tuff like:

“What’s wrong with you?”

“Do you even think about us?”

“You’re only good when you're with your friends.”

“You don’t care about your family.”

“We can’t sleep without you.”

J​ust straight-up guilt-tripping me while I’m literally just sitting in my friend’s car as a passenger. I wasn’t even planning anything crazy, ​just wanted ONE peaceful night out.

M​y mood immediately died. And it was embarrassing because I couldn't just suddenly ask my friend to drive me home early, th​ey’d have to cut the whole hangout short because of me.

S​o I snapped. I told my dad they're being too much, that I’m an adult and I know what’s right and wrong, that we’re always careful, and that nothing bad is happening. I didn’t yell, but I finally said what I’ve been holding in, t​hat I feel suffocated by how strict and dramatic they get whenever I’m not physically at home.

N​ow my parents are acting like I'm the​​​ unreasonable one. They say I “talked back,” I “changed,” and I “value my friends more than my family.” But honestly? I’m exhausted. I go out twice a month. I’m always home. I’m not doing anything stupid. I’m not asking for money. I’m just… trying to live like a normal adults.

s​o Am I the jerk f​or finally stepping out?

It’s filled with hope, sure, but let’s be honest, it can also be incredibly nerve wracking for everyone involved. The structured, safe environment of the treatment center is replaced by the familiar, and sometimes triggering, world of home. This transition is where many struggles begin, and it’s precisely where the support of a sober companion becomes invaluable.

Think about it. You can’t live in rehab forever. Suddenly, the person in early recovery is faced with the same old streets, the same daily stresses, and maybe even the same social circles that were part of their previous life. It’s a lot to handle. This is where a [sober companion](https://recoverycarepartner.com/recovery-services/) steps in, not as a warden, but as a grounded, professional presence. They’re like a bridge between the intensive work of rehab and the challenge of real-world living.

A sober companion provides more than just accountability, though that’s a big part of it. They’re a real-life guide for navigating the mundane stuff that can feel overwhelming. They can help fill the empty hours that used to be dedicated to addiction with new, healthy routines. Maybe that means going to a meeting together, hitting the gym, or just being there to talk through a tough moment over coffee. It’s that consistent, calm presence that makes all the difference.

For families, this support is a lifeline. It takes the immense pressure off you to be the constant watchdog, a role that is exhausting and can harm your relationship. Instead, you can start to just be a family again. The sober companion handles the tough conversations about triggers and cravings, allowing you to focus on rebuilding trust and connection.

Ultimately, the goal of a sober companion from a place like Recovery Care Partner isn’t to create a dependency. It’s the exact opposite. They provide the tools and confidence so that the individual can eventually walk their path independently. They help turn a fragile recovery into a resilient one, making the four walls of a house feel not like a trap, but like a true home, a safe foundation for a new way of living. It’s about making sure the incredible progress made in treatment doesn’t get lost in translation at the front door.",1,1763615877.0,GoodContent,0,1.0,False

1p1ulth,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelSolutions/comments/1p1ulth/main_perspective_to_cultivate/,Main Perspective to Cultivate,"Howdy everyone,

Just a quick tip that I think would really reframe and benefit many men's perspective.

The reason (or at least part of the reason) that some women may prefer a man with ""experience"" either sexually or in a relationship is:

**Because they want someone who already knows how to have fun and relax in a romantic dynamic. (They also -- on average -- want a guy who is willing to both initiate and plan interesting dates).**

That's kinda it, though -- I know everything else is important, but my point with this post is this:

**You can literally just flirt and have fun. The main thing women are looking to do is find men they trust and respect to have fun with -- in whatever capacity.**

Men who have been in a relationship before/have had sex before know that it's just having fun with a date and then escalating once you have privacy.

Sex just kinda happens, I know that might sound a bit odd -- but the key is learning how to plan a fun date and guide the interaction to an extent.

Mark Manson mentions this in his book Models, and I think it's great advice.

Try to plan 3 things to do on a date once you've somehow gotten an opportunity to set up a date with a woman you're attracted to/excited about getting to know (ideally walking distance apart -- but you can also drive them or drive separately or whatever).

An example of this is my first date with my now-girlfriend.

I invited her to meet me at a bouldering gym. We climbed for a little bit, then I drove her and I to a coffee shop with live music (she and I knew each other a bit before going on this date, so she was comfortable riding in my car).

After we did the climbing gym and coffee shop, we decided to go for a walk at a nearby park (walking distance from the coffee shop).

We ended up cuddling on a bench at the park and chatted for a few hours.

Please feel free to ask me any questions about topics I may be able to give perspective on. I can really understand the frustration of literally nobody giving you the time of day. It is extremely frustrating.

Before anything else, I would frankly say:

Get off the dating apps -- at least for a little while. I can expand on this a lot -- if anyone likes, but I suggest you just trust me and commit to getting off them entirely for 3 months.",2,1763615104.0,IncelSolutions,2,1.0,False

I don't want to miss my ex this much since he was so resentful and angry at me at the end, but here I am crying in whats now my new bed in my new home, feeling so out of place and still waking up confused about this new space.

I miss his hugs. I miss the way he'd hold my hand while we drove. I miss his arms pulling me close in bed. I miss how he'd laugh when something stupid would catch him off guard. I miss the excitement I felt when I heard him coming through the front door. I miss the soft way he'd call me ""babe"". I miss the way his hair smells. I miss the way his face relaxed when I gave him massages and back scratches. I miss the way he looked at me with pride when I'd draw something just for him. I miss making a mug of coffee for him in the mornings. I miss watching stupid bullshit together on our couch. I miss the way his lips felt on mine, and how his hands felt perfect on me. I miss the way his hair would weave into my shirts when I did the laundry. I miss his clothes on the floor, the socks kicked off in the sheets of our bed. I miss making lunch for him during particularly stressful work days and seeing him visibly relax upon taking a bite. I miss the too many pillows on the bed, and how his body heat made me too sweaty in the middle of the night. I miss tripping over his shoes. I miss the random slaps on my ass that would catch me off guard. I miss emptying the dishwasher together. I miss him, so fucking much. 

but I don't miss the lack of communication. I don't miss how he would take out his depressive anger on me even when I didn't do anything wrong. I don't miss how he expected me to read his mind when he was doing mentally unwell, and how nothing I did to try and help was ""right"". I don't miss my own mental health tanking every time his mental health tanked. I don't miss how he said he didn't know if he loved me or not but still tried to use me for intimacy and sex. I don't miss how he fixated on someone else in an inappropriate way and then got mad at me for trying to talk about it. I don't miss him getting mad at me for talking about these things with other people, just trying to work through my emotions. I don't miss the way his eyes looked at me at the end, so full of anger and resentment. I don't miss how he saw me cry and said I was making things about myself. I don't miss crossing boundaries that were never communicated to me before he snapped. 

I don't miss what undiagnosed bipolar did to him. but I miss him. 

I knew him before things got bad and I knew him during. I want to know him when he's properly diagnosed and medicated, and if it works out then I'll be so happy but if it doesn't work out then at least I tried and now I know. maybe I am a fool, but I think it would be worth it to try again (with specific circumstances, of course)

I find myself making wishes at 11:11 and on dandelions when I take a walk, that his new meds help him not just stabilize into a better place but also help him find his way back to me. I hope he can break out of his manic depressive episode and that he can push through the shame of acknowledging the shitty way he treated not just me but several others as well

I think he has been trying to cautiously reach out to me again. I've gotten a few messages from him this past week, nothing significant just one here and one there, but it means a lot to me. and I see him occasionally typing something in our chat, only to see it stop and receive nothing. I don't know what to expect right now since it's still early into our breakup and his diagnosis, but I hope he takes his time in finding himself and his words. ",9,1763614752.0,BipolarSOs,6,1.0,False

- (2 cafes were closed at first visit even when their FB page says they were open on these hours....)
- some shops that i visited changed their flavor (downgraded) also i think its bec they just changed their barista/cook
4) Daghan kwartahan sa butuan but they prefer going to mall cafe/resto, mga subok na so your target market majority students to middle income (updated sa social media trends, aesthetic place- invest in one, so your price must be affordable to your target market that even the rich can say- Lami siya ha bisan barato for them)

The biggest thing weighing on me is that my closest friend and I aren’t really talking. We’re on okay terms, but the last time we hung out we were, or at least I was, drunk, and I guess our personalities don’t match because we got into a fight. Idrk how. She just snaps and seems to raise her voice at every little thing. It’s tiring and a part of me is okay with us drifting apart because I don’t feel good around her anymore. And we have opposite personalities so it’s not like I want her to have to deal with me who is more passive on things. I do think that maybe she doesn’t like parts of me that would rather talk things out than just be blunt and cut things off. But it just seems like she gets upset and escalates things before she has a chance to think about it, and then she’ll reset like nothing ever happened after I defend myself (for things like she swears I forgot something she texted me and then will get mad that I forgot and I’ll put up our chats and there will be no mention of said thing at all and then she’ll just laugh at herself and not realize she just pressed me for no reason). It’s been multiple instances like that. I’ve been trying to pinpoint when she started to “just be blunt” about things but idek when. I stopped driving her around to have more time to myself and we gradually stopped hanging out. I feel like the effort I put into things isn’t appreciated, especially not with the way she snaps at everything. She’s been consistently doing c*ke for over a year and when she’s sick asf coming down from a high, calling me up crying and saying she thinks she needs to go to the ER she doesn’t see me snapping at her or lecturing her. I pick up the phone and let her talk, come over and make her food and rub her back. Like, I do love this girl. But when I get quiet or have a hard time expressing myself, it’s the hugest hindrance of her life and she wants to get irritated with me in front of friends and drag me out of bars to uber us home bc she just can’t take wtv it is she thinks is happening. And it’s literally just me being quiet or in my own world or the one time being so drunk off my ass that I don’t even know what to talk about. I can’t be vulnerable with her anymore and while I’m sad to be thinking like this, I think I’m okay with us not hanging out as much. 

But besides that, work is good. I have a nice gov job where I’m learning great skills for my resume. I finish my associate degree next spring. I’ve been celibate for 100 days and 39 days w/o alcohol. It’s not an issue, I actually hate drinking. But after the last evening that involved drinking and me getting yelled at I got so irritated I swore off alcohol for… idk how long but it’s gonna be a long time lol. I get lonely sometimes but it’s given me time to reflect on my last relationships. I look forward to moving after my degree so I would ideally like to wait to break celibacy until after I move. My birthday is coming up soon and there’s always mixed emotions there but I think I’ll take some time to myself and maybe go camping. I went out of my comfort zone and did a pole dancing fitness class with a co-worker which was super fun. After that she took me to a Turkish cafe and I had some amazing coffee. I started up with training sessions at my gym and have been taking myself out on request movie dates, especially bc of all the great anime movies this year lol. I talk to a ton of ppl at work so my social battery is very full. People like my Bleach funko pops on my desk. I had a tinyyy work crush haha. There’s some really good things in my life right now. It’s been very mundane and repetitive but taking myself out on solo dates has been really nice. I look forward to walking around malls and hiking and trying new restaurants. I genuinely think I’m doing okay. I just wanted to get that all out before bed :) ",1,1763614122.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

    Aiyana is immortal, powerful, and possibly the most exhausted woman alive. After a few hundred years on earth, she's learned one universal truth: nothing fixes a crisis like a fresh cup of coffee.
    
    Unfortunately, she's about to need a lot of it.
    
    When a magical mishap summons a T-Rex into the city (yes, a real one), Aiyana finds herself juggling panicked civilians, clueless humans, and the most chaotic magical mess she's dealt with in decades. With Mason, part golden retriever, part man, and Sonja, who definitely knows more than she's saying, Aiyana must keep the world from falling apart.

**The Game** 

Travel around the county playing weird little shows in weird little  venues meeting weird people and having a chill time. You and your  friends are in a lo-fi band, making chill beats to study to and touring  around in a big van.  

**What I Like About This One:** 

I’m trying to find ways to get more ‘cozy’ role-playing games into my  life. The vast majority of role-playing games have huge epic stories  that span the world stopping the Apocalypse Dragon from raining hellfire  down upon the unsuspecting people of Vale Innocen or whatever, but  there’s seldom enough focus on the sorts of cool experiences people have  all the time.  

I played in some cover bands when I was a young man. Didn’t do a ton  of touring but played a few shows, and it was pretty formative for me in  a lot of ways.  

There’s no way to actually fail in this game. You always do what you  set out to do, but sometimes it comes with a setback or ruins your vibe.  And I feel like that’s an ideal way to handle personal, emotional stake  rather than worry about whether or not you can pick a lock to stop the  Doom Minotaurs from flaying your friends.  

**What I’d Do Differently Next Time:**

I’d probably expand on song seeds and songwriting mechanically. I kinda liked the idea of just having a little nugget of a song, a thing you can carry with you out of the game, but songwriting is such an integral part of the band experience that I think it deserves to be represented mechanically.",1,1763613447.0,onepagerpgs,0,1.0,False
1p1u2cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1p1u2cw/disaster_dating/,Disaster dating,"Hello Everyone! 

I just want to vent about a recent disaster date I experienced a few days ago that really discouraged me in regard to finding a like-minded man in the Christian faith. 

So here’s the story. For the ease of the story I will use simplified names. In July I meet a guy on Upward named “J”, he seems to be kind, faith-centered, stable and confident. We meet for coffee on the first date and it goes great. We will go on to have six additional dates. 

Date 1: Coffee (meet & greet)
Date 2: We set up a dinner, I pick the place
Date3:  I invite him to comedy show with me 
Date 4: He invites me to dinner and picks place 
Date 5: I invite him to dinner to celebrate his birthday 
Date 6: He invites me to dinner, I pick the place
Date 7: He invites me to the movies (THE DISASTER) 

Date 2, 
He invited me to a restaurant and we chat over food. He’s attractive and I’m enjoying his company. I had just got over Covid and it was nice to end the dreaded quarantine. We eat, talk,  laugh and then walk outside to sit by the still water. We sit in silence for a bit just enjoying the moment and I turn my head towards him and he takes advantage of the moment to put a big smooch on me. I’m uncomfortable, one because I don’t know him and two because I just got over COVID. I pull away, blaming it mostly on Covid but internally I know he crossed a boundary for me. We sit for a few moments longer and then he walks me to my car, offering to come to my home and help in my garden at 10PM. I question him, reiterating if he is trying to help in the garden tonight? He nods, but the Holy Spirit gives me discernment that this man is on a quest for cookies. So I end the night, thanking him for dinner and heading home. 

Date 3 
He reaches out to me, I have plans to attend a comedy show solo. I invite him to attend because I know he is new to the area and in some way I am still interested in getting to know him more as a person. I try to honor the three date rule because we are all imperfect and I don’t want to always be on a quest for the next best thing. We attend the comedy show, he comes late and he buys the incorrect ticket. I have to talk to the manager and I’m able to get him into this sold out event by grace and grace alone. He takes very little accountability and arrived about 15 mins late. Later that night, I share with him my discomfort with kissing prematurely. He says he understands. 

Date 4 
We go to a Mexican restaurant near his home. His conversation is dry, but I attribute it to the market (finance guy), his introverted personality and his level of work stress. 

Date 5
He tells me a few days before that his birthday is approaching. I find out his favorite cuisine and I’m on a search to find the best place in town. After all he is new to the area and I don’t want him celebrating alone. He’s turning 33 in a new city without a ton of friends. I’m not sure who he is to me yet, but as a human I respect him and I want to do something kind for him. I make reservations to a beautiful venue to celebrate him, cover dinner and buy a card with a customized leather bookmark as a gift because he loves reading. 

Date 6 
We go to a cute intimate restaurant for dinner. We have great discussions regarding our values, my creative projects and our friend groups. I also share with him that I am a cancer survivor. He’s a little shocked, because by the grace of God I don’t fit his stereotypical narrative. I leave this date, feeling as if we may have finally dug deep enough to create a bond. 

Days go by, no phone call, nothing. This entire time we have never spoken on the phone, not even once. He says he doesn’t talk on the phone when I asked him early on. We text to arrange dates or shall I say meet ups, pointless meet ups. 

Date 7 
He invites me to the movies. I agree to go with him, planning to enjoy his company and have a discussion regarding our communication, or lack there of. Up until this point, I thought he may have been just socially awkward or a late blooms in some ways. After the movie, he invites me to his place, it’s walking distance. I grab a game from my car on the way. We go to his place and it’s a studio apartment, so I sit on the floor because the bed is the only other option. We start playing the game and I have to ask him the question “If I could lose one of my senses which one do you think I would give up voluntarily and why?” He responds, “touch, because you are not affectionate at all.” He goes on to say I am the least affectionate person he has ever dated and he has dated women that are “more Christian” than me. He names female pastors and so forth. I listen, and I judge internally. The next question down the line for me to pose to him was “What is something you would like for us to experience together?” He responds, “intimacy.” I laugh, because he knows that I am sold out to the Lord and it’s no chance, but to think after 7 dates with no communication in between is just comical. We have spoken 7 times over the course of 4 months and apparently I owe him my body on a platter. 

He went on to say:
 “I shouldn’t have to teach a 34yo woman this”“You are not competitive in the dating market and I’m trying to teach you how the real world works”
“I don’t call because we don’t have intimacy”
“ It makes me wonder if you’re selfish, this is a red flag”
“I don’t want you to be 50 and not get the outcome you want”
“I really like you, I just want you to think about what I’m saying”
“My ex and I didn’t have sex, but we did other things”

Talk about a nightmare from someone I thought was a Christian brother devoted to the faith asking me to compromise for his sexual pleasure’s.  I was nothing but kind to this man even after this interaction, but I would be lying if I didn’t admit it was discouraging. 

Are others experiencing similar stories? If so, how do you stay encouraged?

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1p1tytz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p1tytz/i_blindsided_my_abusive_ex_and_i_still_feel/,I blind-sided my abusive ex and I still feel guilty 8 months later. Any advice?,"8 months ago, I blind-sided my ex with a break up text at 5 AM while she was sleeping and blocked her on everything. 

It was a long distance relationship with her in San Diego and me in SF. I work somewhat remotely so I would live down there with her a lot. 

Numerous times in our relationship, she would drive recklessly, 110+ mph in the car while I would be crying. 

Her family told her that she was pushing me away, but I was unfortunately the type of person (and still am) that believes in trying everything you can to make a relationship healthy. 

Back in February, 3 days after Valentine's day, she wanted to be more active for her health and go on a hike, which I fully supported and so we went. She tried parallel parking and accidentally hit a car in front of us and then blamed it on me for not guiding her. That did upset me and I went to the trailhead and she stayed in the car not wanting to do the hike. 

She eventually texted me if I don't come back that I will have to find a way home, I walked back to the car and she began screaming at me and driving to find a new place to hike while saying things like ""Don't worry about the Valentine's day gift I made you, I'm going to tear it in half when I get home"" all while tears were coming down my face and I remained silent. 

Eventually, she pulls over and cries and apologizes for how she treated me and that I deserved better. I'm an empathetic person, and just hugged her and said it was ok and that people say things they don't mean. 

This was a repeated scenario for 6 weeks I lived with her in San Diego where she would scream and then cry and apologize, and I would just comfort her. 

The last time I saw her was on March 15th, we were driving back from her parents house outside LA back to San Diego and she was late for class and was driving 110+ mph down the interstate while I was pleading with her to slow down she would just call me being sensitive. 

I texted her sister that she wouldn't slow down and her sister tried calling her but wouldn't pick up. 

After she got back to campus, she asked me why I wasn't talkative and I said it's because she put my life in danger for the third time in our relationship, to which she called me sensitive again. 

I drove back to her apartment and packed my bags and fed her cats and changed my flight that same day. While at the airport, I sent her long texts giving her reassurances that I wasn't breaking up with her and I still loved her, but that I needed space. 

10 days later, I decided to blind-side and break up with her after my closest friends had heart-to-heart convos and concern about me. 

I wished her the best in the text and told her it just was not working and that I still love her and that she would do amazing things in her life. 

A month later, I saw her sister at church and got coffee with her sister. Her sister apologized for her how abusive my ex was and gave me a hug and tears were shed from both of us. 

Back in August, my ex's mom randomly texted me saying they miss me and that their house is my house any time. 

I told her mom I wished them well but kept the text vague to not open up doors and to also just be respectful of me and my ex's healing. 

I became really close with my ex's family. Her dad was disabled and I helped take care of him by myself one week. I helped my ex move to SD for school, I helped her parents move, and helped her sister move. 

I do miss the relationship I had with them but my ex went on a smear campaign that is still on-going on social media about me. It hurts a lot seeing it, and I know I'm just pain shopping when looking at it and should stop.

I know I was abused, but is it normal to still miss your abuser at times? Maybe it's just because of the holidays and I'm alone. But yeah, I just needed a place to vent. ",1,1763613087.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Then I saw something super weird: A waitress literally took an elderly lady's phone, types on it for 30 seconds, handed it back, and then ran to reprint the receipt (I was observing because I wanted some water).

I couldn't figure out what was happening. Then, when I got back home I found a Yelp review. Everything makes sense now!

These tiny tweaks turn any mundane topic into something you actually want to read:

1. Add *""""What's the hidden story behind...""** 

Suddenly everything has intrigue. 

> ""What's the hidden story behind office coffee machines?"" 

Boom - corporate psychology, addiction economics, social hierarchies.


2. Use **""What would an alien anthropologist notice about...""** 

Gets you that outsider perspective that reveals the weird stuff we ignore. 

> ""What would an alien anthropologist notice about LinkedIn?"" 

Pure comedy gold.


3. Ask *""""What's the conspiracy theory version of...""** 

Not actual conspiracies, but the connecting-dots thinking. 

> ""What's the conspiracy theory version of why meetings exist?"" 

Uncovers power dynamics you never saw.


4. Try *""""How is [boring thing] secretly a survival skill?""** 

Evolution angle makes everything relevant. 

> ""How is small talk secretly a survival skill?"" 

Turns awkward chitchat into advanced social intelligence.


5. Flip to **""What would happen if we took [thing] to its logical extreme?""** 

Pushes ideas to their breaking point. 

> ""What if we took remote work to its logical extreme?"" 

Reveals both possibilities and problems.


6. End with **""What does this reveal about human nature?""** 

The psychology angle that makes everything profound. Every mundane topic becomes a window into who we really are.

The trick works because it hijacks your brain's pattern-seeking mode. Instead of seeing isolated facts, you start seeing systems, stories, and connections everywhere.

Best part: This works on literally anything. Tried it on ""filing taxes"" and got a fascinating breakdown of social contracts, trust systems, and why we collectively agree to this madness.

Secret sauce: Combine multiple angles. 

> ""What's the hidden story behind email signatures? What would an alien anthropologist notice? What does this reveal about human nature?""

Even grocery shopping becomes anthropologically fascinating with these prompts.

(WOOD) — Foxtail Coffee is set to replace the Starbucks inside the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel in Grand Rapids.

The Starbucks inside the downtown hotel will close Nov. 30, AHC Hospitality said in a Wednesday release. After renovations, Foxtail Coffee will open in the spring of 2026.

“We’re thrilled to welcome Foxtail Coffee to the Amway Grand Plaza,” Ross Bartlett, general manager of the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel, said in release. “We pride ourselves on delivering exceptional hospitality and creating memorable guest experiences. Foxtail’s warm, inviting atmosphere and quality coffee make it a perfect complement to our hotel.”

The coffee shop will offer extended evening hours and a streetside patio, the release says. On the menu will be coffee drinks, teas, pastries, breakfast sandwiches and gelato.

It will be the seventh Foxtail Coffee location in West Michigan.

Also want to add english is not my first language so i apologize for any typos and/or bad formulation.

Backstory:

I (F22) have been with my boyfriend (M26) for approximately 3,5 years, we met at my housewarming party through mutual friends. At first at thought he was kind of a jerk but once we started talking we clicked instantly. Our mutual friends have since said that we were like magnets, and they had never seen anybody that enamoured with each other within minutes off meeting.I love my boyfriend so so much, and we currently live together with my dog and our cat that we got after he moved in to my first apartment.

When we moved in i was 19 and he was 23. Our apartment was pretty big and very close to the downtown area off our island our place was the designated pre-game spot. At one off our parties we ended up being quite a lot off people (15-20 people) due to friends inviting friends who invited friends, but everybody got along great, and they all asked before inviting people so we truly didn't mind, we ended up having such a great time that we didn't even go out clubbing, we just stayed at the apartment the whole night. At this party i met a girl (F 21, now 23) who we will call Clara (fake name) i have truly never met someone so like my self in every way. I mean we are both the same height, hair and eye colour, similar facial features, same style, similar tattoo styles and our personalities were so alike it was scary. We got along great and she ended up becoming my very best friend. A few week later we had another pre-game at our place and i invited her and some other friends, when i introduced her to my bf i leaned that they had dated previously, this truly did not bother me as it was very clear that my bf was not interested in her anymore, he only had eyes for me. After having a few more drinks she started asking about a threesome (me and Clara are both bisexual), i normally wouldn't mind but since me and bfs relationship was so fresh at this point i felt it would be a bad idea.

2 years later:

Me and boyfriend are still living together and are very happy, and me and Clara are still the best of friends. She has moved to a nearby city but we FaceTime about once a week and the calls usually last from 3-5 hours (we both have adhd so we tend to ramble on about anything and everything.) We didn't meet that often because there is about a three hour boat ride from the island were i live to the city, but we did meet up about once a month. She has been talking to a guy (Matt) for some time and she is starting to fall for this guy, they have been friends for years and she has always kind of hoped they end up together so i was super happy for her! About a month later and they are officially boyfriend and girlfriend. I met Matt for the first time a few weeks after they got together due to them living the city. We got along great, we had a lot of shared interest (gaming, weightlifting etc.) Matt, Clara, me, my boyfriend and three other friends ended up becoming a group.

A few months later me, my bf, Clara and Matt go to my family's camping site. I know many people will think off a small tent in the middle of nowhere when they read camping but it's not like that i swear. We have a big caravan with bunk beds, two double beds, kitchen and bathroom, we also have an insulated all-year awning (awning is not the right word but i can't think off a better one sorry.) And there is a huge patio, if i had to guess id say about 70m\^2. Anyways that's not really important lol. We go ""camping"" for a week and we all had such a great time, and get a lot closer friends all off us.

Skip forward to my 22nd birthday party:

I didn't want to go out for my birthday, because all the bars here kind of suck, so we ended up having a small get together at Claras house with the group mentioned above. We played boardgames, listened to music and drank until like 5am. At this point in time me and Matt are very close friends, we workout together from time to time when he is on the island visiting his family. Back to the birthday- we all mingle and talk and i taught we all had a great time. The next day i get  text from Clara telling me she was uncomfortable with the way i was acting with Matt, looking back i now i spent the a lot off time talking with him but that is mainly because we were sat next to each other, and also we are great friends. Anyways i text her back saying it wasn't my intention to make her uncomfortable and i was truly sorry, if it made her feel better i told her i was willing to cut back contact with Matt but she said it wasn't necessary but asked that in the future i didn't ""cling "" to him so much, which i honestly didn't, i always acted the same way towards him as i did my other male friends, although i didn't say this, i just said i was sorry and that i wouldn't do that in the future.

A few weeks later Clara called me crying because Matt had broken up with her, i stayed on the phone with her for hours talking and trying to console her, at the end of the phone call she asked me how i felt about it which i thought was a bit strange but answers truthfully that i felt very sorry for her because they were so good together and i know how much they loved each other, she asked again about the situation it but me in, and i told her it would be kind of awkward since they were both some of my best friends and i didn't want to compromise either of the friendships. we talked some more after this until we both had to go to bed. i texted Matt telling him Clara told me what happened and that i was here for him if he needed to talk, which he said he appreciated and would let me know.  in the following days i called Clara everyday asking how she was doing and just letting her vent on me. in these phone calls she would often ask me the same question as earlier and i would give her some variation of the same answer i gave her in the first phone call. one day she texted me saying she needed time away from me because she felt i was making their breakup all about me, and said something like ""why are you always bringing up the position it puts you in, what about me? why don't you understand what I'm going through!"" when i literally only mentioned it when she asked i replied that it was not my intention to make it about me i only wanted to be honest with her when she asked, and that i would stop and try to be a better friend to her. after this things cooled down and we started talking like normal again. that was until i got a text from her saying that she didn't want me and Matt to have so much communication going forward, which i get cuz she was still heartbroken, but at the same time i have a boyfriend who i live with and i very much am not interested in anything other that a strictly platonic friendship with Matt. but i texted her to tell her that i wanted to respect her wished and would cut contact with Matt until she felt comfortable with us talking again. she also asked me to let her know every time Matt texted me , which i did. I thought everything was fine between us now, and we had another 4 hour FaceTime session were we barely spoke about the breakup. after we hung up i fell asleep and woke up the next morning to like 6 paragraphs from her on text saying basically that she felt i disrespected our friendship and that she didn't want to deal with people like me in her life and that she no longer wanted us to be friends. i was dumbfounded, i had literally done everything she asked of me and then some, i even ordered her favoritt coffee to her door and tried my best to be there for here in the way she told me she needed. i texted back that that i was very sorry it had to go this far and apologized for my part in our friendship falling apart, and that i understood she needed time to heal from this and even though she did not want me in her life i would always be there for her if she ever wanted to try and be friends again.

about a month after this i texted Matt and told him that since me and Clara no longer talk, and its been a while if he thinks it would be okay if we started talking again. he didn't see an issue with it and i was so happy, i had missed my friend. he moved back to the island and we started working out together a few times and it became more and more frequent, ended up at 4-5x per week. Clara had found out we were working out together at told Matt she sins like it and wanted us to stop, Matt called me and let me know to which i said it was up to him what he wanted, i ofcourse didn't want to lose our friendship again but couldn't exactly force him to hang out with me lol. he said he wanted to respect what she wanted to which agreed.

TW: MENTION OF SUICIDE ATTEMPT

about two weeks later/ two months ago i had a family emergency, i won't go in to much detail but my mother tried to take her own life. she has a bunch off issues and this kind of thing had been going on for years, but this time it was a whole different story for reasons i won't explain here.

after a week of downward spiraling on my end i ended up texting Matt letting him know i was having a very hard time and i needed my friends, and asked him if we could have one gym session, he instantly agreed and after that we started working out regularly again.

i found out last week that Clara had moved to a different country, so i honestly don't feel that bad about this but i could be wrong.

so reddit, am i the asshole here?

Clara had found out we were working out together at told Matt she sins like it and wanted us to stop, Matt called me and let me know to which i said it was up to him what he wanted, i ofcourse didn't want to lose our friendship again but couldn't exactly force him to hang out with me lol. he said he wanted to respect what she wanted to which agreed.

TW: MENTION OF SUICIDE ATTEMPT

about two weeks later/ two months ago i had a family emergency, i won't go in to much detail but my mother tried to take her own life. she has a bunch off issues and this kind of thing had been going on for years, but this time it was a whole different story for reasons i won't explain here.

after a week of downward spiraling on my end i ended up texting Matt letting him know i was having a very hard time and i needed my friends, and asked him if we could have one gym session, he instantly agreed and after that we started working out regularly again.

i found out last week that Clara had moved to a different country, so i honestly don't feel that bad about this but i could be wrong.

so reddit, am i the asshole here?

1p1ts61,https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1p1ts61/tips_for_christmas_in_rome_food_and_sites/,Tips for Christmas in Rome? (food and sites),"I’ll be staying in Rome over Christmas (24-27), and I’m looking for local recommendations for food and activities, especially since many restaurants and sites will be closed or require reservations. 

My group of 4 is pretty adventurous with food, but we don’t drink alcohol or coffee. I’ve gotten a lot of pasta recommendations (although feel free to send more), but I’d also love recs for some lighter meals and breakfasts. And of course good dessert.  I don’t speak Italian so I’m nervous about understanding menus (working on duo lingo and restaurant vocab), so if there are specific dishes you’d recommend from a place let me know! Or spots where everything is good and I could essentially choose at random and trust it’s good. 

We have tickets to the Vatican the morning of the 24th, and are hoping to score tickets to the C0losseum (plus underground) and other ticketed locations for the 26 or 27.  But what are the places we should wander and see on Christmas Eve and the 25th when many places are likely closed?

  
Or if you have any other tips for Christmas in Rome, send them my way!",1,1763612510.0,rome,1,1.0,False
