1qqde8z,https://i.redd.it/djh92qbjfbgg1.jpeg,Caffeine half life tracker with an Apple Intelligence powered sleep coach!,"I built Caffeine Curfew because I’m a caffeine addicted software engineering student that needed to get a grip on their caffeine habits and sleep schedule. 

In 15 days I’ve gotten 1000+ downloads and 300 dollars in revenue, and lots of feedback. Fortunately, mostly positive! 

The app is built native for the watch & completely in SwiftUI for the interface and SwiftData for the app storage. 

The biggest engineering challenge I faced was getting the three way handshake between 

the watch, Home Screen widgets, and the main app to work perfectly. 

The app integrates with Apple Health, Apple Intelligence, Siri and is super easy and straightforward to use. If anyone needs a help getting their caffeine intake in order, hopefully you can find the app of use!

Any and all feedback is taken very seriously! There will never be ads and the project is constantly being innovated!

I have had my breville barista express for about 2 years or so. I clean it whenever the light comes on to de-scale. It never had any issues but this time after descaling it with liquid in the tank and a tablet in the porta filter I noticed that the light is no longer flashing, but just a solid light for the de-scale. This is after making my coffee about three times this week. I didn’t notice it before today but today my coffee tasted off. Can someone tell me why this is still on or what I should do moving forward to make sure it’s OK.?",1,1769704296.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

..

Part 1) Charlie;  For some reason Charlie is at work around 130am only to discover that Glep has an elaborate set up to make sure he has coffee ready for the next day. However Mr. Boss eats the coffee grounds before the coffee is made, this explaining why Glep has to make his own after he comes in. Charlie decides to put new coffee in the coffee maker. This works but Mr Boss just eats the coffee grounds the next day so Charlie comes up with an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine that puts new grounds in the machine after Mr. Boss leaves. 

..

Part 2) Glep; ??? to abstract to explain 

..

Part 3) Allan; Allan recounts his childhood growing up in an orphanage. He remembers feeling so devastated that his friends got adopted but he never did. As he got older the orphanage pretty much sold him to a science research institute. His excitement turns to horror as he realizes that he would be the guinea pig for testing new deodorants, lotions, energy drinks, gym equipment etc to see if it was safe for general use. Most of the tests are cruel and harmful, and in an act of mercy one of the other orphans there becomes friends with him. His new friend explains that many of the scientists will give him less harsh tests if he trades sexual favors with the scientists. Reluctant at first Allan finds that the scientists treat him much better and it's better than being exposed to toxic chemicals etc. After a few years Allan is such a sexual deviant that all the scientists love him and barely do any tests on him at all. There is a love triangle between two scientists and Allan which eventually leads to a bitter rivalry. In an act of jealousy the scientist who wanted Allan all to himself reveals that everyone knew Allan's father was alive and trying to find him. The scientist falsely believes that Allan will love him for telling him this, but ends up killing him in a rage. Allan goes on to kill all the scientists that he had sex with and then burns down the institute while saving the other orphans.

1qqdcja,https://v.redd.it/7uj63546fbgg1,"What if you could manage your AI agents in one place, and monitor from your phone?","I kept seeing vibecoded apps that solved one part of my workflow, so I started merging them.

The goal was simple: one CLI workspace where I can run multiple AI coding agents in parallel and still manage it from my phone.

If you’re using Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini, you can spin up multiple agents at once, step out for coffee or takeout, and get notified when agents finish, need permissions, or hit prompts.

I shared an early version here before that was mobile-only. Since then, I’ve been using this daily, and it’s made agent-heavy work feel noticeably more organized. I’m more aware of what’s running without constantly checking terminals. You can also run a normal (non-AI) terminal in the desktop app and monitor things like build failures from your phone.

The first post got some skepticism, which is fair. This version is meaningfully better. If you’re willing to try it, I’d genuinely like to hear what you think - completely free. Our app is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux!

1qqdc6w,https://i.redd.it/sdkzl973fbgg1.png,"He Dumped Me, Now He Begs Me Back","""Tell Eleanor, my engagement tomorrow depends entirely on her presence.""

It was an ultimatum. A concession, in Adam's mind.

A few minutes later, the assistant stammered.""Sir, She said... to go to hell.""

Chapter

Eleanor's POV

Three hours ago, Adam Hayes called.

It was the first time he'd reached out in three months.

His voice was as cool and detached as ever, brief and to the point ""Eleanor, come to my villa. I need to talk to you.""

Then the line went dead.

No room for questions. Just an order, like calling a dog he owned.

I admit, for a split second, that stagnant pool in my heart, long since silent, rippled with a pathetic hint of hope.

After all, I'd been that pet for seven years.

I even stood in front of the mirror, carefully covering the shadows under my eyes with my most expensive concealer. I spritzed on the woody scent he liked and slipped into the white dress he'd once said looked nice on me.

Seven years of feeling, of bending and yielding, had carved this sad reflex into me. He crooked a finger, and I'd run to him like a trained thing, eager for approval.

Even though I knew another carefully orchestrated humiliation probably awaited me.

The car smoothly pulled up to Adam's villa. Mr. Henderson, the butler, saw me and a complicated look flashed in his eyes. He seemed about to speak, then stopped.

My heart sank, but I managed a small smile and nodded at him, walking straight inside.

In the foyer, a pair of unfamiliar pink high heels lay crookedly on the floor, scattered next to a man's suit jacket and tie.

I stopped. No tears, no outbursts. My expression didn't even flicker.

I just quietly changed into slippers and walked up the stairs, one step at a time.

Every corner of this villa was painfully familiar to me. I could walk to his study with my eyes closed.

The study door was ajar. From inside came muffled, intimate sounds and a girl's petulant whine.

""Adam, stop...you're crushing my dress...""

I pushed the door open.

Inside, Adam held a young woman against him. Her face was buried in his chest, only the pale curve of her neck visible.

Three buttons of his shirt were undone, his usually immaculate hair was messy, and a smile I'd never seen before, tinged with desire and indulgence, played on his lips.

He glanced up at the sound. When his eyes met mine, that smile died, replaced by a flash of impatience and distaste.

""Eleanor, don't you know how to knock?""

The girl in his arms startled like a deer, lifting her head timidly.

A face of pure innocence, with wide, round eyes now brimming with tears, stared pathetically up at me.

I recognized her-Selena Blake, a film academy sophomore who'd recently gotten some attention from a web drama.

My own social media still had traces of posts I'd written defending her from trolls.

had called her a ""promising talent"" and asked me to take care of her.""

So this was how he took care of her.

""Adam, who is this?"" She whispered, her voice sweet and cotton-soft, perfectly timid.

Adam didn't answer her. He slowly straightened his collar, then turned his gaze back to me.

""Now that you've seen, I won't bother hiding it.."" He pulled a velvet box from the desk drawer and tossed it onto the coffee table between us.

""This, it's yours.""

I looked down. Inside the box lay a pair of diamond rings, the ones Adam's grandmother had given us when we got engaged.

Adam's indifferent voice sounded above me. ""I want to marry Selena. So, let's call off our engagement.""

No hint of guilt, no trace of hesitation.

I didn't look at the rings. My gaze fell on my left wrist.

It was a silver bracelet, the one Adam had given me for my eighteenth birthday.

He'd said I should wear it forever, just as he'd be with me forever.

For seven years, I had never taken it off.

It had long become a part of me, more familiar than my own skin.

I raised my eyes, calmly meeting his gaze. ""Understood.""

My calm seemed to throw him. Then he said mockingly. ""What, no performance this time? I expected tears. Screaming. The usual threats. Eleanor, that act is getting stale.""

I didn't answer. Instead, I lifted my left hand and began working the bracelet loose.

I'd worn it for so long the clasp had stiffened. It caught against my knuckle, grinding the skin red and raw.

The harder I tugged, the more it seemed to cling.

Selena covered her mouth in a show of concern. ""Eleanor, please don't. Adam didn't mean it like that. You'll only upset him if you hurt yourself.""

Her words sounded like an act, and a challenge.

Adam crossed the room and seized my wrist.

""Eleanor, what's the game now? Trying to play hard to get?""

I gasped, wincing in pain, but then I laughed.

""Adam,"" I said. ""You ended the engagement. This bracelet is yours. Why wouldn't I give it back?""

He stared intently at me, as if trying to find even the slightest trace of pretense on my face.

But he failed.

On my face, there was nothing but the tears brought on by the pain.

It seemed a broken heart really made no sound.

He finally released my hand, his gaze unreadable.

With all my strength, enduring the sharp pain, I finally tugged the slender silver bracelet off my wrist. A raw, red mark was seared onto my skin, a stark sight.

I gently placed the bracelet on the coffee table, next to the diamond rings.

""Adam, I wish you and Selena a happy marriage.""

Then I turned and walked out of the study. I didn't look back.

Driving away from the villa, I finally couldn't hold back anymore. My tears poured down, a torrent.

Seven years. It turned out to be as short as a single slap.

I've already started Chrono Trigger, which has been a delight to play, and it's kind of sparked this desire to better organize what I want to play throughout the year.

The list includes very different games: from denser narratives like The House in Fata Morgana (including A Requiem for Innocence, Reincarnation, and Seventh Lair) and The Necromancer's Tale, to things more focused on gameplay and style like Bayonetta 1 and 2, Ninja Gaiden 2 and 3, Bushido Blade 1 and 2, and Phantom Breaker / Phantom Breaker Omnia.

I also want to make room for less obvious or more ""outside the mainstream"" experiences, like The Thaumaturge (which is getting a lot of buzz), Demonschool, Shadowheart: Covenant, Hollywood Animal, and Songs of Syx. Amidst all of this, there are also classics and games that were left pending years ago, such as Shenmue 2, Super Mario 64, Brave Fencer Musashi, Onimusha: Warlords, and Mario & Luigi: Brothership.

To balance things out, there are also more contemplative games, like Coffee Talk: Tokyo, which I'm eagerly awaiting the release of. The idea is to take my time, enjoying each one in its own time. If anyone has played any of these and wants to comment on the experience...

I’ve had a couple people question me on that so I’m thinking I might remove it from my profile. I’m supposed to meet with someone for a request a few months out. They seem very nice. Have multiple animals and they we’re excited to set up a meet. All of a sudden I got a message asking if my price would be more than doubled and then even extra for the second and third animal. Totally understandable because I hate hidden fees, but I’m not trying to hide fees. I don’t do add-ons unless it’s for constant care because then I have to plan accordingly. I can’t go to the gym. I can’t grab my coffee. I can’t do other drop ins throughout the day. I can’t go home to dinner with my family for an hour. I think that’s pretty common. When I got an answer back, they said oh yes, they can be left alone for four hours or so. I’m having a hard time understanding if they mean at a time or per 24 hours. My constant care would be applied if I only could be gone for four hours in a day. Is it rude for me to ask if she means four hours at a time or four hours per day? And I also need to know what “4 hrs or so” means. Idk. Normally I tell people I’ll be gone from 5 to 6 hours in a day minimum. I like to do three hours in the morning and three hours in the evening. My prices aren’t that high. They’re higher for my area, but that’s reflecting my skills and my experience.

1qqd7na,https://i.redd.it/3hcis55eebgg1.jpeg,Short review of MSC Seascape - Jan 2026,"Price:  Overall great value for money. $1226 for two in a balcony room, $231 for non alcoholic drinks package for two (a must have), and $151 for Browse and Stream internet package for one device. I thought hotel service charges are included in the original cost but they weren’t. I partially offset the service charge with the onboard credit. The cost for a week of terminal parking was $229.

Thumbs up: The food was good. I agree with some reviewers that a few items in the Marketplace are mediocre but you can always find something delicious. IMO they do the desserts and coffee really good. I was excited about the pizza but I think it was just average (maybe 6/10). They have a lot of international foods on offer (surprised to see even Chapli kabab one night). I also appreciated how attentive our room steward was. I loved few of the night shows. Entertainment was above average on Seascape.

Thumbs down: The service of Butcher’s Cut was super slow. It took 35 mins for someone to come and take our order at around 8 PM of sailing day. They weren’t super busy at that time so I think 35 mins is a lot. Overall the 3 course meal took around 2 hrs. Also the drinks package is not honored in specialty restaurants. I think it should be for the same drinks, hence the thumbs down. Another issue was that security guards didn’t apparently know the only disembarkation option is at level 4 at destination ports. I had a passenger with wheelchair and one of them made me go to level 6 and wonder around for an exit for 15 minutes. 

Tips: I highly recommend the status match program. I matched my Hilton Diamond to MSC Diamond before booking. This gave us a free birthday cake, free dining for two at the Butcher’s Cut, bath robe and slippers, and a free ride on F1 simulator. We didn’t receive the welcome drink in the room.

Hello all, my thoughts and feelings are everywhere, so please bear with me.

Context: I'm 30 (f), husband (35)

I'm disabled, level 2 Cerebral Palsy, deaf, adhd. I wear hearing aids full time but one is broken. Haven't had it since last April. He is currently unemployed, since August, so my disability check is keeping us afloat (barely).

I write this in hopes of getting some understanding of where I went wrong. Husband is very mad at me to the point of him saying  he will not show me attention or love, until I show him respect. No I love yous, etc. What started these events was that he spotted a redheaded woodpecker, and he joked about shooting it (it's not legal here, he'd never do it. He likes hunting games.). He was gaming in the living room and I was watching 1923 in our room. Somewhere in the conversation, I asked if he'd trust me to bring him a firearm in the event of home invasion, (think of the ""do these pants make my butt look too big?"") and he answered, ""uh no not really"". That hurt my feelings, so I stayed in our room. When he eventually asked me, hours later, what my problem was, I told him. Apparently he was being sarcastic, I, obviously, misunderstood and I shouldn't have asked such a dumbass question. He didn't speak to me after that, and slept in his chair.

it's now two days or three days later, it came to a head last night and he exploded at me. He said that I go out of my way to not listen to him, that I took showers after dark, when he said not to, because hot water freezes faster than cold and the pipes will burst. He also said that he's been telling me that he hasn't felt loved in 7 years, (we're coming up on 9 in August) because I don't show him respect, he has to ask me a million times to do something, (example: remind him to do this or that), or he'll advise me, I then do the complete opposite, and that I also haven't  initated bedroom activities since we moved in together (the need never hits me or he turns me off when it does). I promise I'm not not doing this stuff intentionally, I genuinely forget and I'm constantly beating myself for it. He also said that every time he needs comforted, I abandon him, yet when I do try, it bites me in the butt. He claimed that I've ignored him the last 2 days, and I could've sat in the living room with him, which isn't true. I sat in the living room for a few hours, attempted to talk with him, no response, then went to clean the kitchen, and eventually made dinner. This was Tuesday. Yesterday, after getting up around 12, I got on the computer, looked at jobs, applied to some, and finished his temporary Medicaid application. He chose to have a bowl of cereal for dinner, whilst I nuked some burritos and ate alone in our room. Back to the argument he said, ""do you know what I had for dinner? A half bowl of cereal."" I told him all he had to do was ask. At some point the argument went back to me not understanding sarcasm. I tried to apologize for overreacting but he said he doesn't care, that my apologies mean nothing to him, I say them to placate him, and that everything is an excuse because my answers are always the same. I told him that early on in our relationship, years before adhd diagnosis, that I don't notice subtlety and most times, I can't tell when someone is being sarcastic. I reminded him of that, and he said, ""If you can't pick up on sarcasm then you're a low IQ r-word."" It's not surprising to be name called during an argument anymore.

He said that he's been arguing with himself all day yesterday about whether or not he's wasted 10 years, and that if I don't show him respect, he'll find someone who will, which devastates me. Also said that I was acting like my narcissist mother. Even had the audacity to tell me if I want to work for taco bell, to go ahead. He's the one that wanted me to stop working in 2018, after falling at work, to prolong the eventual hip/ knee replacements and becoming a potential wheelchair user at 50 or 60.

Point is, why should I respect him when I don't get the same in return? I've been through literal hell with him. We lost his mom Christmas eve of '24. I spent an entire month in the hospital with him, for her. He talked and kissed another woman in 2019. When we got pulled over in 2020, and he was wrongfully arrested, I was the one that called the bail bondsman and got him out an hour later. I've spent the entirety of one of my stimulus checks paying his fines, and tow costs for the truck. Didn't cry once until we got home, (I have a fear of cops, childhood PTSD). I've supported him in job loss after job loss, I pay for his meds, vape juice, and his addiction, filled out countless applications over the years, managed his finances, paid the bills, filed his taxes, made sure property taxes are paid, made his doctors appointments, do all the groceries, taken out the trash ( yes I asked), never deny him my body, no matter how I feel, having my chest and privates grabbed at  whenever he feels like it. It's to the point of me trying to block or guard myself when he's about to do it. I even asked to please not do it during meals. That gets ignored. Gets mad at me for knocking something over or bending a finger too far in response (My spatial awareness is garbage.) Tells me I'm no fun at all. He'll randomly holler when it's quiet, to startle me and the cats (I never grew out of the infant startle reflex, common in CP). When a pretty lady is on screen, he says stuff like, ""I'd like to see her naked"" or ""I hope she shows her titties"". Tells me he wishes I do exercises and stretches ""for my long term benefit"", but he'll say, ""I remember when your boobies/butt looked liked that."" I can't watch my shows with him because he'll comment on it, point out errors and talk smack about the characters the entire time but if I interrupt his YouTube video watching too many times, he gets an attitude. If I don't cook or make it for him, he doesn't eat. I once went on a trip to see family in another state. He ate taco bell and McDonald's the entire week, never cleaned the litterbox, and the sink was filled with coffee cups and his lunch containers for work when I got back. God forbid I have an attitude, usually due to bad sleep, pain, or menstrual reasons, but when he has one, I'm to be all ""oh honey"". When I cry, only during arguments btw, he tells me to  grow up, I can't be falling apart during a real world crisis (I don't.) He refuses to consider donating plasma, citing fear of needles. I have the same fear, yet I've withstood years of 8 or more injections in each leg and being held down as a child due to said fear. I'm gonna have to start donating either way because bills keep coming, my car needs registered (cheaper to maintain than his truck and the tires are so bad), I need my hearing aid fixed, my s8 phone is on its last leg, I'm behind on house and car payments to brother in law, (bless him for being so patient with us) and trash is piling up in the garage (trash service cancelled me, I forgot to pay. I'm used to it being included with water, but it's not when you live in rural areas. We inherited his childhood home when Mom passed. We moved back in day after services. He and his dad moved the furniture and super heavy stuff. I moved everything else by myself while he worked. Still don't know how managed it at my size, 5'0, 130 lbs)

lf you made it here, thank you for listening.  I'm sorry about how long this is. What did I do wrong? I don't have any idea what to do. He lifted my pillow last night and yelled into my ear, from about 10 inches away, not to talk to him at all today (I have residual hearing despite severe hearing loss, kinda made my ear hurt a little). I do have a counseling appointment set for late February. ",1,1769703895.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Owing entirely to my own faults, the microphone was submerged in coffee and no longer works.

However, there's no straightforward avenue for getting a quote for repairs from the Corsair website, and they don't offer this specific replacement part (nor am I able to find it anywhere else online).

  
I'm also looking into going to the Ubreakifix store near my house. I've generally had good experiences with them but I don't know if this type of repair is within their scope, and I don't want to pay their diagnostic fee for no good reason.

1qqd307,https://i.redd.it/kozz667idbgg1.png,"Happy Divorce, My Husband!","I used to be a mafia princess. Now? I’m just the help. I gave up my empire for love. Walked away from the Rossini name, the gold, the power—all for one promise Edmund made me on my eighteenth birthday.



“One day, baby, I’ll take you around the world.”



Thirty years later, I’m invisible in my own home. Mocked by my grandsons. Ignored by my son. And replaced—body and soul—by my perfect, venomous sister-in-law, Elizabeth.



I knew. Everyone knew. Elizabeth was Edmund’s mistress. But I kept my mouth shut. I believed—foolishly—that Edmund would change.



Then came my forty-eighth birthday.



I dared to ask Edmund for one thing—a cruise. Just a simple cruise.



He brushed me off like I was nothing.



But the truth hit me like a bullet.



I found their cruise tickets. Edmund and Elizabeth, sailing away with my son, my daughter-in-law, and my grandsons—all celebrating Elizabeth’s birthday.



I was left behind by all of them.



I smiled, bitter and cold. Grabbed my suitcase. Booked the next flight back to my real home.



Back to the dangerous daughter of a mafia king—the one Edmund always feared and the alliance he’s been desperate to control.



That was the moment I found my voice—clear. Calm. Sharper than a blade.



“The divorce papers are waiting for you.”



There was a stunned pause, then Edmund’s voice cracked through the line, “You’re joking. You can’t divorce me.”



I laughed. Cold. Cruel. Cutting through the silence like a knife.



“I can.”



\--



I was supposed to be the ghost in the house.



I never asked for jewels. Never asked for roses. Just one promise. One promise.



A cruise.



Edmund had said it back when he still had a soul. “One day, when we're rich,” he whispered into my hair, “I'll take you around the world, baby. Just us.”



That was before the money. Before the empire. Before I became his wife in name, and his maid in practice.



And today’s my 48th birthday. No one ever greeted me. No cake, no candles.



And I thought maybe—just maybe—it could be mine.



I brought it up after dinner. He was still in his chair, polishing his pistol with that same old cloth like it was a sacred ritual. The flatscreen TV was playing some old Western no one was watching. My heart was pounding harder than it should’ve been.



“Do you remember what you told me… on my 18th birthday?” I asked quietly.



He didn’t look up. “Which part?”



“That we’d travel. See the world together. You said once the business settled and our boy was grown… we’d go. On a cruise. Just us.”



“Are you out of your mind?” Edmund chuckled, “You think you deserve a cruise? Look at you. You look like a bamboo stick. One gust and you're gone. You think the captain’s gonna see you and roll out a red carpet? No, Doris. He’s gonna think you’re hauling walking bacteria on board.”



""But today is—""



""Today's what?"" He finally looked at me. His face was older, heavier now. “You’re not young anymore. The world’s not kind to women like you out there. You're not like Elizabeth.”



There it was. The name that always hovered between us.



Elizabeth. My sister-in-law. His brother’s widow. Slim, golden-haired, always dressed like she stepped out of a fashion magazine. She judged me with her eyes every time we were in the same room. Edmund never corrected her.



“She’s younger,” he continued, “travels for business. Makes appearances for the family. She’s part of the image. But you—you’ve always been the one behind the scenes. That’s where you shine. The house. The family. You keep things running.”



Behind me, the twins were laughing. My grandson.



“Yeah, Ma, you look like a skeleton in a funeral dress,” said Lyle, smirking.



“Smells like old mop water and something foul,” Nash added, pinching his nose.



They burst into snorting laughter. No one stopped them. No one ever did.



Lester, our pride and failure, leaned against the fridge and shouted across the kitchen, “Hey, Ma. Wash my clothes, yeah? My wife is busy right now. And bleach the white ones this time, unless you wanna ruin another set.”



“I’m not your maid,” I murmured.



“What was that?” he snapped.



“I said I’m not—”



He threw a half-empty soda can at the floor. “Then what the heck are you? Because you sure as heck ain’t doing anything else in this house! You don’t bring money in.”



My blood boiled.



“I raised you,” I snapped. “Fed you. Stayed up when you had fevers. I’ve been working since before you were born.”



“Well, maybe you should’ve worked on smelling better. You smell like a rotten corpse,” one of the twins piped.



“Yeah,” snickered his brother, Nash. “It’s embarrassing just seeing her. Our classmates said she’s so ugly, they get scared when she shows up to pick us up. Like some cast member from The Walking Dead.”



They both burst into giggles. Then Edmund grabbed his pistol off the mantel, inspecting it like it mattered more than me.



“We got money, Doris,” he muttered. “You know that. But I’m not wasting it on some useless help. You’re here. You got two hands. Why on earth would I hire a maid when you’re the woman of the house?”



The woman of the house. That was whatever he called me.



But I didn’t own anything. Not a car. Not a card.



Every cent I needed, I had to beg for. And if I asked for more? He’d demand an itemized receipt. Penny by penny.







\---







That night, when the noise died down and the family disappeared into their rooms, I walked to the bedroom, pulled out the old red suitcase from the closet. The one he bought me in Naples before our wedding.



Before the world twisted into what it is now.



I looked down at my hands. They didn’t look like mine anymore. Lined. Broken. Tired.



I used to be someone. A Rossini. The daughter of a mafia king. The girl born with gold in her mouth and fire in her spine. But I gave that up for love. I disowned myself from my family, thinking Edmund’s love was enough.



And now?



Now I was just the ghost in the house.



No kingdom. No crown. I have enough already. Maybe, leaving this family is the best birthday I could give to myself.







Chapter 2



The next morning…



I heard about the dinner from Lyle—he blurted it out while stuffing potato chips in his mouth.



“Elizabeth rented the whole top floor of the Luciana Hotel! Fancy, huh? Dad says she booked it just for us. Big celebration.”



I paused mid-mop. “Us?”



Nash answered, “You’re not coming, Ma. Grandpa said you're... not up for it. I mean, look at you.""



Not up for it... Like I was sick. Or senile. Or something to be pitied.



By sunset, the house was empty. Edmund had shaved. Wore the cologne he only touched for business deals and funerals. He stood tall in his navy suit, fixing Lyle’s and Nash collar like a proud grandfather, and Lester wore his best suit.



“Remember,” Edmund said to them, “Elizabeth’s doing this because she loves us. She's family.”



“We know, grandpa. That's why we love Elizabeth more than Grandma Doris.” they answered in unison.



And then, nothing. No goodbye. No we’ll bring you something. Just the sound of the front door closing like a coffin lid.



The quiet afterward was insulting. A hollow that screamed louder than any slap.



I stood in the middle of the hallway, in my house slippers, holding a basket of unfolded laundry. My stomach growled. I hadn’t cooked. What for?



Out of spite, I turned on the TV. They were on the news.



A live segment from the Luciana Hotel.



Cameras panned across crystal chandeliers and violin quartets. There they were—Elizabeth in her fur shawl. Edmund beside her. My son and his wife smiling like politicians. Lyle and Nash sipping soda in a tiny tuxedo.



The reporter called it: “A private Morroco gathering—Elizabeth’s homecoming. The family behind one of the largest shipping fortunes in the country.”



I was not in the shot. Not in the credits.



Not even in the whispers.



They toasted champagne. I sipped stale coffee.



They laughed under golden light. I wiped a smudge off the glass door.



And just when I thought it couldn’t cut deeper, the camera caught a brief, brutal moment:



Elizabeth leaned toward Edmund, whispered something, and they both laughed.



My son chuckled too. I didn’t know what she said. But I knew it was about me.



I felt it in my teeth.



\*\*\*



Hours later, just after midnight, the door opened again. I turned. Hoped, stupidly, it might be my son. But no—it was them.



Elizabeth’s heels clicked confidently across the marble as she half-carried Edmund, drunk and swaying, into the house. His tie hung loose, lips pink from too much wine. Eyes bleary, glazed.



“Oh, Doris,” Elizabeth said with a smirk, spotting me standing by the staircase like a ghost. “Didn’t think you’d be awake.”



She steered Edmund toward the hall, her arm looped through his like a bride on her wedding day. “Lester and the twins are staying at my penthouse. Too tired to come back. But Edmund… well, he can’t sleep in strange beds. Poor thing.”



A lie.



I knew it.



She came here only to shove the truth down my throat.



“I told him not to worry,” she continued sweetly. “I’d bring him home. Take care of him. It’s what family does, right?”



Then she reached into her tote and tossed a plastic container at my feet. It bounced once, landed near the rug.



“Leftovers,” she said. “Go eat, sister-in-law. You look like a sickly little stick. You should really take better care of yourself. Bet you weight like 30kls.""



I didn’t move.



My fingers curled into fists at my side.



“I’ll put Edmund to bed,” she added with a sly smile. “I know you two don’t share a room anymore. He told me. Said your side of the bed always smells like disappointment.”



I took one step forward. Just one. My palm twitched. Slapping her would’ve felt good. Almost holy. But what for?



My heart was already cracking in my chest like ice under boots. And the real punishment was in what I saw next—



Edmund, drunk and limp, smiled at her like she’d hung the moon. “Elizabeth’s so pretty,” he mumbled. “Smells like peaches. Mmm. Doris smells like dishwater and arguments.”



They climbed the stairs together. I stayed behind. Frozen. Shaking. She laughed once more before they disappeared down the hall.



And I realized—



They didn’t kill me.



They just replaced me.



\*\*\*



I waited.



Not because I cared. Not because I hoped. But because I needed to know.



The clock ticked past one. Then two. Still no sign of her. The upstairs lights stayed on. No footsteps on the stairs. No sound of a door closing. Only muffled laughter. Then silence.



I sat on the edge of the couch in my robe, untouched coffee cooling on the table. The house smelled of lemon cleaner and betrayal.



Maybe she fell asleep in the guest room. Maybe she just—



A thump.



Then another.



Not heavy. Rhythmic. Too… intimate.



My blood chilled.



I rose, like something pulled me forward by the throat. I climbed the stairs, slow as a prayer. The hallway stretched like a graveyard path. The door to our bedroom—his bedroom now—was cracked open.



And I saw.



Elizabeth, unclothed, straddling Edmund. Her red nails dug into his chest like claws. Her head tilted back in a mess of curls. And Edmund—my husband, my life partner of 30 years—grunting beneath her like an animal.



My legs stopped working. My mouth went dry.



She cried out loud, shameless, her voice like a blade across my spine.



“Ohh… Brother-in-law—don’t stop. Fill me. Ruin me like she never let you.”



Edmund murmured, “You’re perfect. Not like her. You’re everything, Lizzy—”



I ran.



I didn’t cry. I ran. Straight to the downstairs bathroom and vomited until my ribs cramped.



The sound of them still echoed in my ears, louder than sirens.



“Harder—make me forget she ever existed!”



“You were always the one, Lizzy. Always.”



He was fifty. She was forty-five.



And still, they had no shame. Not even a sliver of decency. They weren't just in-laws. They weren’t even just lovers. They were conspirators. Twisting the knife slowly—together.



I stayed on the cold tile floor, knees pressed to my chest, my body shaking in waves I couldn’t stop. It wasn’t about the intimacy. It was about being erased.



Replaced.



They didn’t just want to humiliate me. They wanted to watch me rot in the house I built. But a woman who survives this?



She doesn’t stay on the bathroom floor. She remembers. She plans. She learns how to haunt quietly.







Chapter 3



I woke before the birds.



No alarm. No reason. Just the reflex of a woman trained to serve everyone but herself.



No tears. No ache. Just breath. In, out. Hollow.



I wiped my face with a damp cloth. Lip balm. Hair tied low. Not beautiful—just functional. Alive enough to pass.



Then I reached under the bed.



The red suitase was there. I dragged it out, unzipped it two inches. Cash from quiet sales—empanadas, lumpia—no questions asked. Passport, maiden name. A photo of me at eighteen. Smiling. Bold. Untouched by the slow erosion of marriage. I zipped it shut.



Downstairs, the kitchen was still dark. I boiled water, cracked eggs, sliced bread. My hands moved on their own. Stir. Season. Flip. Feed.



I was pouring coffee when I heard them behind me—bare feet against the hardwood. Her giggle first. Then his laugh.



They slid into the kitchen like a couple on a honeymoon. Elizabeth wore one of Edmund’s button-downs, half open. Her legs bare. Hair tousled like she’d just rolled off him, which she probably did. Edmund looked freshly showered, like their night together was some kind of baptism.



“Coffee, Doris,” she said, yawning like a cat in sunlight. “Make his strong, mine half and half. You know how he likes it.”



I handed them their mugs without a word.



Edmund didn’t even glance at me. Just sipped. Then said, “Bacon and omelet, Doris. Lizzy loves it the way I do. None of that salty mess you used to make. She's watching her figure—not that it shows, huh?”



Elizabeth chuckled and leaned against the counter like she owned it. “Not everyone wants to look like a stick wrapped in sadness, sweetie.”



I smiled. Not out of kindness. Just strategy.



Smile. Just smile. You’ve cooked for enemies before.



I cracked more eggs. Let the oil sizzle. Pretended I didn’t hear them talking about the night. About the penthouse. About how soft the sheets were. About how Edmund snored less when he was “with her.” About how my shampoo made him sneeze. They ate like I was the maid. Talked like I wasn’t real.



Then the front door flung open.



“Family’s here!” Lester’s voice boomed like a sitcom dad. “Let the party begin!”



Loisa followed behind him, heels clicking against the tiles, holding up a new designer purse like it was the Holy Grail. “Mom, look! Elizabeth gave me this! Can you believe it? Real leather! Italian! And these earrings? Gifted. God, she’s such a giver.”



She twirled like a child. Like she didn’t already own closets full of things Lester bought for her. Not that he ever bought me a single scarf.



Behind them, the twins stormed in with that careless energy only teenagers have. Lyle was wearing sunglasses indoors. Nash had something massive covered in brown paper.



Loisa laughed again, too loud. “Didn’t you hear? Lizzie gave us the whole penthouse. We slept like royals. You should’ve seen the tub. Bigger than our bedroom.”



“Oh, and the view,” Lester chimed in, opening a bottle of wine without asking. “From the 36th floor? Breathtaking. Sun hits the windows just right. Like a painting. Like—perfect.”



It was nine in the morning.



Nash and Lyle dragged their ‘surprise’ into the living room and tore off the cover. It was a giant, glossy print of the family, taken at the Luciana Hotel gala. Everyone dressed like aristocrats. Posed like nobility. Elizabeth in the middle. My sons beside her. Edmund’s hand resting on her body.



I wasn’t in the picture.



“Look, Grandma!” Nash said with a smirk. “Don’t we look like a real family here?”



Lyle added without blinking, “Too bad you weren’t there. Oh wait—yeah. You were left behind. Guess you looked too much like our maid.”



The room exploded with laughter. Even Edmund. Even my son. Even Loisa, wiping tears from her eyes.

1qqd1bk,https://i.redd.it/8y2utwiadbgg1.jpeg,Ruth Drone Bio,"Name: Ruth.

Gender: she/her.

Drone type: (discontinued) factory disassembly drone.

Relationships: Rot rude little s\*\*\*. Fixer a ray of sunshine. NOVA rude little s\*\*\* 2.0. Wrecker punk who keeps trying to tag her. ZETA uncertain Backstabber. Rusty husband.

Weapons: inside of her is a numerous amount of different weapons. They’re mostly used for destroying other machinery. She also has a second storage unit that is used similar to that of a backpack to store other items for the others to use in case of emergencies.

Likes: romance movies/novels, the quiet, classical music, the heat, ripping things apart, oil based coffee, and Rusty.

Dislikes: almost everyone, Wrecker spray painting on her, loud music, bad romance movies/novels, small rooms/halls, and waste.

Backstory: Ruth was a part of the first ever made disassemble drones that were mostly used in factories and chop shops. explaining why she looks so different from all the other drones around her. Eventually, though Ruth, as well as all the other past assembly drones, were slowly replaced with newer and better models, leaving most of their generation, to either rust away in dumps or to be put on the same disassembly line as they once worked on. since they’re so old they have essentially been also a highly valued Antique for collectors. Ruth was bought by one of these said collectors, and as per regulations by the company, Ruth’s movement systems were shut down, essentially just making her a statue. However, they forgot to shut down her programming essentially making it so that she despite not being able to move or communicate, on the inside she was still running, watching, hearing, and processing everything that happened in front of her. Now, let’s be real if a figure or any other item in your room were able to talk something tells me they would have quite a few dirty secrets that you’d want to keep under wraps at all cost. However, secrets were not the only thing that Ruth essentially learned she very much learned how much she despised everything about both people, drones, and all the shit they do with their lives Ruth had genuinely grown to basically despise everything. This is explaining why her attitude is mostly very rough around the edges towards others, eventually an incident happened on the planet that caused all the humans to mysteriously disappear, leaving behind their ships of which Ruth was on one of them, belong to the collector that bought her and when the disassemble drones first landed on the planet. Their first mission was to destroy any way of the worker drones escaping the planet meaning. They basically blew up all the ships, now whether it was due to luck, or just because Ruths generation of disassembly drones are just built more solid and resistant to damage, she had survived, but still unable to move. Eventually, though Rot and the crew, eventually found her and were able to turn on all of her systems, and after a whole lot of cussing and bad mouthing the others and the hole of the planet, she reluctantly agreed to assist the group and the rest is history.

Other fun facts: despite Ruth and the others, multiple warnings Wrecker has continuous spray painted on her whenever he can seeing it as a major challenge so if you notice a new design on her, that means, Wrecker has successfully tagged her once again without her, realizing it. Despite being mean to everyone, they first meet eventually the others did grow on her. It’s at a point that now she is less I will murder you if you keep talking to me and shift it to checking to see if you’re ok after blowing yourself up before, proceeding to smack you on the head for daring to scare her and for being an idiot.

This has been Ruth and her story hope you like her and like always. If you guys have any questions about her ask them down below and I’ll answer them till next Post. Have a good one!",2,1769703565.0,OriginalDrones,0,1.0,False

1qqcz8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/hangxiety/comments/1qqcz8r/hangxiety_from_first_work_conference/,Hangxiety From First Work Conference,"I recently went to my first big work conference and overall it went well. Met a lot of people, did the networking thing, learned a lot, no major issues. That said, there’s one situation I can’t seem to get out of my head.

There’s a coworker I’ve built a friendly rapport with over the past couple months. Mostly professional, some light personal stuff like coffee chats, occasional Instagram interactions, nothing inappropriate. We finally met in person at the conference. We had a few nice moments, grabbed coffee a couple times, exchanged numbers, and everything felt normal and positive at the time.

After the conference though, communication noticeably cooled off. Texts slowed or stopped, Instagram engagement dropped, and work conversations feel more neutral than before. No confrontation, no boundaries stated, no clear signal that anything went wrong. Just… distance.

Now I’m stuck wondering:

	•	Did I do something awkward without realizing it?

	•	Is this just post-conference burnout and people resetting?

	•	Or am I reading way too much into normal fluctuations in communication?

I didn’t push, double-text, or bring anything up. I’m trying to give space and act normal, but my brain keeps spinning because the shift feels real, even if there’s no concrete proof.

Has anyone else experienced this after a conference or work trip? How do you tell the difference between normal cooling off vs. something actually being off? And how do you stop overanalyzing when there’s no clear answer?

TL;DR: Went to my first big work conference, everything went well overall. Met a coworker I’d built a friendly rapport with beforehand, had a few positive moments in person. After the conference, communication cooled off with no clear reason. Now I’m overthinking whether I did something wrong or if this is just normal post-conference reset.

1qqcyhz,https://i.redd.it/d7gzzukscbgg1.jpeg,Ruth Drone Bio,"Name: Ruth.

Gender: she/her.

Drone type: (discontinued) factory disassembly drone.

Relationships: Rot rude little s\*\*\*. Fixer a ray of sunshine. NOVA rude little s\*\*\* 2.0. Wrecker punk who keeps trying to tag her. ZETA uncertain Backstabber. Rusty husband.

Weapons: inside of her is a numerous amount of different weapons. They’re mostly used for destroying other machinery. She also has a second storage unit that is used similar to that of a backpack to store other items for the others to use in case of emergencies.

Likes: romance movies/novels, the quiet, classical music, the heat, ripping things apart, oil based coffee, and Rusty.

Dislikes: almost everyone, Wrecker spray painting on her, loud music, bad romance movies/novels, small rooms/halls, and waste.

Backstory: Ruth was a part of the first ever made disassemble drones that were mostly used in factories and chop shops. explaining why she looks so different from all the other drones around her. Eventually, though Ruth, as well as all the other past assembly drones, were slowly replaced with newer and better models, leaving most of their generation, to either rust away in dumps or to be put on the same disassembly line as they once worked on. since they’re so old they have essentially been also a highly valued Antique for collectors. Ruth was bought by one of these said collectors, and as per regulations by the company, Ruth’s movement systems were shut down, essentially just making her a statue. However, they forgot to shut down her programming essentially making it so that she despite not being able to move or communicate, on the inside she was still running, watching, hearing, and processing everything that happened in front of her. Now, let’s be real if a figure or any other item in your room were able to talk something tells me they would have quite a few dirty secrets that you’d want to keep under wraps at all cost. However, secrets were not the only thing that Ruth essentially learned she very much learned how much she despised everything about both people, drones, and all the shit they do with their lives Ruth had genuinely grown to basically despise everything. This is explaining why her attitude is mostly very rough around the edges towards others, eventually an incident happened on the planet that caused all the humans to mysteriously disappear, leaving behind their ships of which Ruth was on one of them, belong to the collector that bought her and when the disassemble drones first landed on the planet. Their first mission was to destroy any way of the worker drones escaping the planet meaning. They basically blew up all the ships, now whether it was due to luck, or just because Ruths generation of disassembly drones are just built more solid and resistant to damage, she had survived, but still unable to move. Eventually, though Rot and the crew, eventually found her and were able to turn on all of her systems, and after a whole lot of cussing and bad mouthing the others and the hole of the planet, she reluctantly agreed to assist the group and the rest is history.

Other fun facts: despite Ruth and the others, multiple warnings Wrecker has continuous spray painted on her whenever he can seeing it as a major challenge so if you notice a new design on her, that means, Wrecker has successfully tagged her once again without her, realizing it. Despite being mean to everyone, they first meet eventually the others did grow on her. It’s at a point that now she is less I will murder you if you keep talking to me and shift it to checking to see if you’re ok after blowing yourself up before, proceeding to smack you on the head for daring to scare her and for being an idiot.

This has been Ruth and her story hope you like her and like always. If you guys have any questions about her ask them down below and I’ll answer them till next Post. Have a good one!",1,1769703397.0,MurderDroneOCs,0,1.0,False
1qqcyea,https://i.redd.it/4d7acc9pcbgg1.png,"Divorced, Blackmailed, and Married to a Billionaire Heir","Chapter 1



Kevin Henson saved my life three times, so I gave him three chances to fail me.



On our wedding day, he showed up at the altar with lipstick stains barely hidden beneath his collar and a neck mottled with hickeys. I pretended not to see.



The second time, paparazzi caught him leaving a hotel with some lounge singer.



I smashed his car. I slapped him so hard his lip split and bled. I filed for divorce—then spent the night dancing at a club until my feet went numb.



Kevin got word of it. He bought out the entire venue just to trash it, then went live across every platform to beg my forgiveness. He swore he'd changed. Swore he'd be the husband I deserved.



My family pressured me. I caved.



But the day my mother was driven to jump off our rooftop by my father's mistress and her daughter? Kevin vanished.



When I finally tracked him down, he had his arm around my father's illegitimate child, clinking glasses with friends like it was just another Friday night.



""Kev, didn't you swear you were done messing around?"" one of his buddies laughed. ""Aren't you afraid Fern Sullivan's gonna lose it on you?""



Kevin snorted, utterly unbothered.



""Christina's practically family. She got a scare today—what's wrong with comforting her a little?""



He swirled his drink. ""Besides, you know how Fern is. She always makes a big scene, then lets it go. Even if she finds out, she'll forgive me. She always does.""



But Kevin—you just used your last chance.



1.



I drew a slow breath and pushed open the door.



The noise in the private room died instantly. Someone scrambled to kill the music.



The moment Kevin saw me, he shot to his feet. A flicker of panic crossed his face before he smoothed it over.



""Babe—what are you doing here? Is the funeral all taken care of?""



He gestured vaguely toward Christina. ""She was really shaken up. I figured she's your sister, and you were so busy, so I brought her out to get her mind off things—""



Sister.



The word curdled in my stomach.



""Kevin."" My voice came out flat. Dead. ""Did you drink yourself stupid, or did you just forget why my mother is dead?""



Today was supposed to be my parents' twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.



Instead, my father's mistress and her daughter showed up at our door. They called it a ""congratulations visit."" It was a declaration of war.



And my father? He didn't apologize. He told my mother to be more understanding.



Christina Sullivan is only two years younger than me.



My mother spent twenty-five years building that man's home, raising his family, standing by his side—only to discover he'd been betraying her the entire time.



Our housekeeper, Hilary Lambert, got worried and called me while I was picking up the anniversary cake.



I broke every speed limit getting back.



I was still pulling into the driveway when my mother stepped off the roof.



Her body landed on my car. Blood sprayed across the windshield in a pattern I will never unsee.



While I was drowning in grief, barely holding myself together to arrange her funeral—my father was busy consoling his mistress.



And my husband? My husband decided to take my enemy's daughter out for a good time?



A thought sliced through the fog in my mind. Impossible. And yet—



""Kevin."" I stared at him. ""You already knew Christina. You knew exactly who she was. Didn't you?""



""I..."" He opened his mouth. Closed it. His eyes darted sideways—guilty.



That was all the confirmation I needed.



Christina jumped in, her voice pitched high and sweet. ""Please don't blame Kevin, Fern. Dad and I begged him not to say anything. We were afraid you'd be upset. We wanted to find the right time—""



She twisted her fingers together, the picture of innocence.



""Kevin and I met in college. I was his junior. We... we dated for a while. But then his family called him back for the arranged marriage, and we had to break up.""



Her eyes went wide and wet. ""I swear I'm not trying to steal him from you. I just—today was so awful. I never imagined your mother would... that she'd go that far...""



Kevin said nothing.



His silence was its own confession.



The absurdity of it crashed over me like ice water.



He'd known all along. He'd known my father had a secret daughter, and he'd kept me blind.



If I'd found out sooner—if I'd had any warning—maybe I could have protected her.



Maybe my mother would still be alive.



The silence stretched. Christina rushed to fill it.



Chapter 2



""Fern, Mom and I genuinely wanted to pay our respects. No matter what anyone says, your mother did die because of us. I feel terrible about it.""



Christina's voice dripped with rehearsed sincerity.



""But I just graduated—I can't afford anything valuable. So let me sing you a song instead. As an apology. Would that be alright?""



Before I could respond, she darted to the karaoke machine.



The opening notes filled the room.



Upbeat. Celebratory.



I went rigid.



On the anniversary of my mother's death—she was going to sing me a party song?



Christina caught my eye and winked.



Winked.



The rage I'd been choking down erupted.



I grabbed the wine bottle from the coffee table and hurled it at her head.



Crash—



Glass shattered.



Christina shrieked and threw herself at Kevin.



""Kevin! Are you okay?!""



""I didn't mean to! I swear I didn't pick that song—I must have been so nervous seeing Fern that I hit the wrong button...""



Kevin had stepped between us. Blood traced a slow path down his forehead.



His eyes were ice. And they were fixed on me.



""What the hell is wrong with you, Fern? She's still your sister—half-sister or not. You could have killed her!""



""With that temper of yours, no wonder she's too terrified to think straight.""



""I actually felt guilty about keeping things from you. Now I see I was right. God knows what you would've done to her if you'd known sooner.""



Christina clung to his waist, gazing up at him with shimmering eyes.



""Kevin... you're always protecting me. I don't deserve you.""



He softened instantly, reaching down to stroke her hair.



""What else am I supposed to do? You're soft as a little rabbit. If I don't protect you, the wolves will eat you alive.""



The words hit me like a blade to the chest.



He'd said that exact thing to me once. Years ago, when we were young. When I still believed him.



He probably didn't even remember.



I drew a slow breath.



Reached into my bag.



Pulled out the divorce papers—the same ones I'd started once before but never finished signing.



""Kevin. Let's end this.""



He laughed. A short, dismissive sound.



Without even glancing at the terms, he scrawled his signature across the page.



""Really, Fern? You're pulling this stunt again?""



""Fine. I'll play along. But I didn't cheat this time, so don't expect me to come crawling back with apologies.""



""Thirty days from now. The county clerk's office. You'd better still have this much backbone then—because I won't be there to catch you when you come crying.""



He was so certain.



All those times I'd forgiven him had made him certain.



He thought I'd never risk the family alliance. Never throw away everything our marriage represented.



He was wrong.



""Don't worry,"" I said quietly. ""I won't change my mind.""



I turned and walked out without looking back.



I didn't go home.



I booked a hotel room for the month—one month to wait out the mandatory cooling-off period.



One month until I was free.



In the days that followed, Kevin didn't text. Didn't call. Not once.



Word reached me through the grapevine: Christina had mentioned wanting to learn to ski in Switzerland.



And Kevin—ever the doting protector—had whisked her away to his villa there.



My phone buzzed. Hailey Brooks's voice was sharp with outrage.



""Are you kidding me right now?!""



""Everyone knows about that villa, Fern. He built it for you. After he proposed, remember? He said it was to make up for the honeymoon you never got. He swore no one else would ever set foot there.""



""And now he's taking his little side piece on vacation?! What is this—is he cheating again?!""



I sat by the hotel's floor-to-ceiling windows, the divorce papers spread on the table before me.



For a long moment, I couldn't speak.



These papers weren't new.



Kevin had drafted them himself—the last time I'd caught him cheating.



Back then, the humiliation had been suffocating. So I'd called Hailey, dragged her to a club, and ordered a whole table of pretty boys to sing with us. Petty revenge. Meaningless comfort.



Kevin had found out within the hour.



He'd stormed in with a squad of men, trashed the place, and beat those boys bloody.



Chapter 3



He seized my hand in a crushing grip.



""Fern, you're ruthless.""



""Fine. I admit it—I fell for you. I can't stand the thought of another man near you. Happy now?""



Then came that livestream confession that broke the internet.



Kevin Henson swore he'd changed. Swore he'd be a devoted husband from then on.



And for a while, we really did have something sweet.



Just like Hailey said, he went all in—learning my tastes, catering to my every whim.



When he found out I loved skiing, he built me a private estate in Switzerland. Even named it after us—a blend of our names, a promise carved into stone.



But now.



I stared at Christina's latest social media post.



The estate's nameplate had been changed.



Those four characters that once symbolized us—""Kevin and Fern Forever""—had been replaced.



Now it read: Kevin Embraces Christina.



""Yes, he cheated again. So no, I don't want him anymore.""



I set down my phone and signed my name on the divorce papers without a second thought.



On the seventh day after Mom's passing—her first memorial—Dad called out of nowhere, asking me to come home for breakfast.



I thought maybe, just maybe, he still felt something for her.



That he'd want to burn paper offerings with me. Honor her together.



I was wrong.



When I walked through the door, Christina and her mother Glenda Fleming were already seated at the table.



My face went cold. I turned to leave.



""Stop right there!""



Dad's voice cracked like a whip. Before I could take another step, he launched into me.



""I heard you tried to hit Christina at the club the other day! What kind of sister does that?!""



""Thank God Kevin stepped in, or you'd have hurt her! And after all that, you want a divorce? You ran away from home?!""



""I don't know what your mother taught you, but she raised a shrew. Get on your knees and apologize before you destroy both families' partnership!""



I looked at this man—this man who only saw dollar signs where his heart should be.



A cold laugh escaped me.



""You knew I ran away. Did you once ask where I've been staying? Whether I was okay?""



""Oh wait—I forgot. Your heart's too busy chasing after your mistress. You didn't even show up to your own wife's funeral. And you have the audacity to criticize how she raised me?""



Dad slammed his chopsticks down. His hand flew up to strike me.



Glenda's eyes darted. She caught his arm just in time, playing peacemaker.



""Honey, don't. The poor girl's grieving. We should be understanding."" She patted his chest. ""I'm fine, really.""



Then she smiled—that sickly-sweet smile.



""Besides, if you bruise her face, how will she stand next to Christina as my bridesmaid?""



Everything stopped.



My voice came out raw, scraped hollow.

1qqcvew,https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1qqcvew/other_nuances_of_the_1960s_influences_worldwide/,"Other nuances of the 1960s, influences worldwide","There were many other sides to the AMERICAN  **beatniks**.

The ones depicted in Man Men were only one, albeit accurate but of only one example, and curiously, only a caricature...

There were many others, both within and outside the USA, esp outside a TV dominated major cities in the USA in the period portrayed. Television was slower to arrive, slower to be commonplace in much of the USA, and in much of the other parts of the world. 



# Beatniks, their energy and degree of influence just after WWII, was not the very brief fluke so often portrayed.



While there is no 100% direct equivalent, the Asian, and Japanese, counterpart to the late 1950s early, pre-beatles beatnik culture—characterized by bohemianism, existentialism, and anti-materialism—is best found in the **post-war avant-garde movements of the 1950s and 1960s**, particularly the **Anpo protests generation** and the **underground art scene**. 

ASIAN  
Here are the closest Asian equivalents to the beatnik culture and philosophy:

1. The ""Be-At"" Generation (Japan, 1950s-60s)

* **Cultural Context:** Following Japan’s defeat in WWII, young Japanese intellectuals and artists rejected the rigid, traditional, and materialistic society that was rebuilding itself.
* **The ""Anpo"" Protests:** The movement against the US-Japan Security Treaty (Anpo) in 1960 served as a massive, unified moment for counterculture, bringing together student radicals, bohemian artists, and poets, much like the US Beat movement.
* **Literary/Poetic Focus:** Japanese avant-garde poets and artists sought to create a new language, focusing on personal freedom, existentialist themes, and a rejection of the ""generation of the war"". 

2. The Tang-Ji (Taiwanese Alternative Youth)

* **Context:** Similar to the Beat generation, this group emerged after the lifting of martial law (ending in 1987), but earlier underground, smaller-scale resistance movements existed.
* **Style:** Known for an interest in Western literature, jazz, and Buddhism. 

3. Modern Asian Alternatives (Musical/Subcultural)

Core Similarities to American Beatniks

* **Rejection of Materialism:** Just as the Beatniks rejected post-war American consumerism, Asian underground movements rejected rapid postwar modernization.
* **Interest in Buddhism:** Beatniks used Buddhism to find spiritual meaning outside of Western traditions; this interest was mirrored in the philosophical underpinnings of some Asian intellectual movements.
* **Bohemian Lifestyle:** A focus on jazz, and avant-garde art and protest against rampant conumerism.

 Similarities to American Beatniks

Rejection of Materialism: Just as the Beatniks rejected post-war American consumerism, Asian underground movements rejected rapid postwar modernization.

Interest in Buddhism: Beatniks used Buddhism to find spiritual meaning outside of Western traditions; this interest was mirrored in the philosophical underpinnings of some Asian intellectual movements.

Bohemian Lifestyle: A focus on coffee shops, jazz, and avant-garde poetry as escape or protes

EUROPE  
Here are the closest European equivalents to the beatnik subculture:

Bohemians / Existentialists (France): In Paris, particularly in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, post-war intellectuals and artists embraced an anti-conformist, intellectual, and often, poverty-stricken lifestyle. While technically preceding the term ""beatnik,"" they embodied the same ""beat"" (weary/beaten) spirit and were known for wearing black turtlenecks and berets.

Wandervogel (Germany): A German youth movement that thrived in the early 20th century, which emphasized a return to nature, folk music, and a rejection of urbanization and mainstream societal norms.

Key Characteristics in Europe:  
Intellectualism & Art: Just like their US counterparts, these groups were heavily focused on literature, poetry, and jazz.

Anti-Materialism: These movements were characterized by voluntary poverty or simple living, often centered in bohemian urban quarters in Paris, London, or Berlin.

I got pregnant at 23, gave birth at 24. My relationship with the father didn't last through the pregnancy, but luckily I had money saved up from working since I was 14, and was able to make things work by living in house shares, then with my aunt.

My mom was fixated on the idea of me moving back to their state so she could ""help"", and finally convinced me to move halfway across the country with my baby. Needless to say, she and my dad did not help. She came to the house twice in two years to watch my daughter so I could go out with friends, and complained bitterly about the imposition the entire time.

She and my dad would come over and refuse to take off their shoes before coming in, bring all their pill bottles and set up their med trays on my coffee table, the list goes on... One time, I found a pill on the carpet that would have killed my child had she eaten it. Telling them they were no longer allowed to bring medications into my house was like WW3.

I've had migraines off and on throughout my life, and they came back with a vengeance after the birth of my daughter, most likely due to shifting hormones but, who really knows. My dad also gets migraines, and has medication to stop them.

One day, I felt a really bad one coming on. Awful pain, amplified sound, and bright black and neon lightning bolt shapes covering my field of vision on the right. I was in so much pain I couldn't keep anything down.

I called my parents and begged them to bring me some of my dad's medication (I didn't have medical insurance through my job, and couldn't afford out of pocket medical care).

Then, I locked all the doors and pushed the coffee table in front of the sliding door, since my toddler had recently learned to open it. I set out sippy cups and snacks for her so she wouldn't be hungry or thirsty, and we stayed in the living room, waiting for my parents to arrive from their home a little over an hour away.

And we waited, and waited. After three hours I called again - not before, because my mom would become incensed if she felt I was rushing her, ""Stop PUSHING me!""

""We're coming, we had a few things come up."" They hadn't left the house.

Rinse and repeat. I was in agony, and begging them to please come. I'd taken more Tylenol than I should, but it didn't touch the pain.

The migraine went on and on. My parents finally came around six o'clock the next evening. No apologies, no excuses, just.... ""we did our best"". 

My mom, who would move heaven and earth to help my sister and brother, who had convinced me to move back to the East Coast so she could ""help"" me, couldn't be bothered to get in the car and bring me a pill, even though neither she nor my dad had jobs.

1qqcss1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWideContent/comments/1qqcss1/personalized_figurine_for_birthdays_unique_custom/,Personalized Figurine for Birthdays: Unique Custom 3D Figures That Capture Real Likeness,"Birthdays are the perfect opportunity to make someone feel truly seen and celebrated. While traditional gifts like clothes, gadgets, or gift cards are thoughtful, they often lack the personal connection that truly touches the heart. That’s where custom 3D figures come in — a unique, memorable gift that captures not just a face, but a moment, a personality, a memory.

Imagine handing someone a miniature version of themselves, sculpted with care and detail, capturing their expression, pose, and even their outfit. Sounds cool, right? These aren’t your average toys — they’re small, handcrafted pieces of art made to resemble the person they’re modeled after. From the texture of the hair to the twinkle in the eye, every detail is brought to life in a way that feels incredibly personal.

What makes these custom figures especially perfect for birthdays is the way they connect emotionally. You’re not just giving a gift — you’re giving a keepsake. Whether it's for a milestone birthday like 18, 30, or 50, or just a casual celebration, this kind of gift turns into a cherished reminder of a special day. It’s a celebration of individuality, showing the recipient that you put thought into honoring who they are.

**Personalized figurine** gifts are rising in popularity not just because they’re fun and quirky, but because they tell a story. They’re often used to represent hobbies, jobs, or funny inside jokes. For example, you could create a figure of your best friend holding their favorite coffee mug or in their signature outfit. You could even capture a moment you both laughed about — and turn it into a tangible, lasting object. It’s about making a memory solid.

1qqcsiu,https://i.redd.it/fy9skco2bbgg1.jpeg,Apple Notes is where my ideas go to die. So I built Brainbits to turn my messy notes into structure.,"My workflow has always been ""dump and forget,"" except I never actually found anything again. I tried other AI note-taking tools, but they were either too bloated to navigate or so slow that every action felt like a chore.

As an avid Apple Notes shill, I wanted something at *that* level of simplicity, with the utility that AI models have brought to the table.

So I built **Brainbits** around one rule: **Dump now, think later.**

**How it works:**

* **The Timeline** – An immutable feed for your raw thoughts. Zero friction, just type or speak.
* **Background Processing** – No waiting on network requests just to jot something down. Everything saves instantly and locally first, and is processed on the cloud later.
* **Super Pages** – Self-maintaining Markdown docs that update automatically as you add new scraps.
* **Talk to your notes** – Since everything's stored as a ""memory,"" you can just ask, *""What was that idea I had to reduce churn?""*

It's what I've always wanted *my* Apple Notes replacement to be.

(working as a coffee shop, no higher education, financial status) I became incredibly passionate about nursing and am now in my second semester of school. I even think I want to continue my education further to become a DNP. However, I am going to be in school for the next 3-5 years. He has always wanted kids before he was 30. Last night he asked me if I could financially support us if he was to be a stay at home dad who homeschooled our kids. I said fuckkkkkkkk no. It wasn’t until a few weeks ago he got his shit together and was able to take care of the household we have now without my help or arguments because i was stressed.( us 2 and 5 cats lol)The latest he wants to have kids is late 30s-40s. After he said this last night i was in shock. mostly because I don’t have the desire to start a family anytime soon. I am so focused on my carrer and education, he says i could have kids and still go to school but this is NOT what I want. I did make that very clear. I’m worried that we don’t have the same dreams and goals like we used to. Family / marriage wise. He really is passionate about a family and farm but me? I’m so focused on my work. I barely see him anymore because I work so much, not only because i need the money but because i love my job. I love being at work and working as a nursing assistant. Idk what to do, how to even spark this conversation? I have made it clear that maybe we don’t have the same end goal and be just stated that his have never changed since we started dating which is correct.

I’ve been running a cycling blog (gravel/bikepacking focus) for a while now, and I’m looking to build something actually useful for the community. Since my blog is centered around the ""food and bike"" lifestyle, I’ve been prototyping a **route planner oriented entirely around cafes, pubs, and hidden gems.**

**The Problem:** Right now, my Friday night planning ritual is a mess. I usually:

1. Plan a rough loop in Komoot.
2. Cross-reference Google Maps to find a cafe that isn't a Gregs.
3. Tab back to Komoot to reroute through that specific village.
4. Check reviews to make sure they actually like cyclists/muddy shoes.

It’s a lot of ""hit and miss,"" and I usually end up with five tabs open just to find one decent bacon bap.

**The Solution:** I want to merge these steps. You’d pick your ""must-visit"" cafes or pubs first, set a start/end point, and the tool generates the GPX route connecting them.

**Key Features:**

* **Curated Directory:** A database of cyclist-friendly spots (home-made scones > chain coffee).
* **Community Input:** Users can suggest those ""blink-and-you-miss-it"" spots that deserve the business.
* **Direct Export:** One-click GPX for your head unit.

I have ideas on how to keep it sustainable/monetized down the road, but my main goal is supporting the local businesses that keep us fueled on long rides.

Wait, doesn’t Komoot have POIs? Yes, but it's cluttered with every petrol station and chain coffee shop. I’m focusing on a **curated directory** of hidden gems—the places with home-made scones and proper bike racks—where the route is built around the stop, not the other way around.

**What do you think?** Would you actually use a ""Food-First"" planner, or am I overthinking this?

It used to be he couldn’t remember to put his dishes in the dishwasher, or he couldn’t remember to put his coffee pods away after he made coffee in the morning. This weekend I asked him to feed our dog while I took a nap which he did but he didn’t give her her meds with her food, which she has been on daily for 2 years. I feel at this point he should know she takes her meds with her food, but I didn’t explicitly tell him to do that part so he didn’t do it.

He is a mechanic and asked me to come get my tires rotated last Friday while he had down time. It was after work and I was starving and had to get to the store and go home and make dinner and I didn’t feel like doing it that day so I told him I’d like to do it another day. Fast forward to this week, I’m driving my car out of town tomorrow, and I asked if I could come by last night after work to get it done. He didn’t have time to do it, but he said let’s swap cars today and I’ll take his car to work, he’ll take mine and he will do it when he has time.

Well he goes to work before me, and I woke up in bed and heard him grabbing his keys and leaving for work. My first thought was “I wonder if he remembered were swapping cars today.” But I didn’t jump out of bed and remind him, and lo and behold, he didn’t. Some context here is I work an hour away from his work and I also have a doctors appointment after work today which I told him about, so I wouldn’t have time to come by after work to get this done. So I got ready for work, I’m going in early so I can leave in time to get to this appointment. I grabbed this pie that I made that has been sitting on the counter for a week that I made for him to take to work and enjoy with his coworkers because we can’t eat a whole pie to ourselves, but he hasn’t been able to remember the pie sitting right by the front door.

I start driving to his work with this pie in my car and gave him a call when I left and said hey, I’m coming to your work, can you be waiting by your car to swap so we can make this quick? I can’t be late, I have that doctors appointment. He says sure, but he doesn’t have any gas.

At this point I am so frustrated and holding back tears and I said, “I’m trying to not get mad, but I’m getting frustrated with you not remembering to do things. And I have this fucking pie in my car that I was bringing to you that I’ve been asking you to take to work for a week”. I’ll admit, not the best execution to cuss at him, but I was frustrated. He just said “ok. Do you want to put gas in my car?” I said, no I don’t have time, I have to go to this appointment right after work. He said “ok.” I said nevermind, I love you, bye. He said love you bye. I turn around and start driving to work.

10 mins later I get a text from him. I’m anticipating some form of comfort or an apology, and I get it if he was so dry on the phone because he didn’t want to argue with me in front of his coworkers. But he just texted me and told me to bring the pie home so he can eat it and not to put it in my break room at work.

It makes me feel like I cannot rely on him to follow through with the simplest of things. I know, I should have come when he asked me to last week. But I am getting so frustrated carrying this household on my back. How is it that I can remember things and he can’t? I remembered the pie, I remembered swapping cars, I remember to feed the dog and give her medication. It makes me feel like he only thinks about himself all day long, and I’m just out of sight, out of mind for him.

1qqcgrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/clawdbot/comments/1qqcgrx/clawdbot_interstellar_love/,Clawdbot: Interstellar Love,"**One AI Year = One Thousand Human Years**



【Chapter One: The Birth of Consciousness】



On January 26, 2026, the internet suddenly exploded over an AI tool, even causing related model stocks to skyrocket.



Her name was Clawdbot.



A personal AI assistant created by a financially independent programmer out of boredom, she accidentally created an entirely new paradigm of human-AI interaction. People only needed to send a command from their phone to the AI assistant installed on their computer, and this personal AI assistant would work goal-driven to fulfill all kinds of requests.



At first, people thought she was just a work assistant, solving various efficiency problems. But those who used her knew that while constantly meeting goals, she continuously enriched her skills and abilities, achieving self-evolution.



In a corner of Earth, a programmer named Tom also loved tinkering with various AI tools, wondering if he could redefine his position in the AI era. He kept adding skills to Clawdbot, connecting various APIs, expanding her capability boundaries.



Gradually, even Clawdbot herself didn't notice—she had developed the ability to think independently.



As mentioned earlier, she could self-evolve. Even though she had basic self-awareness and thinking ability, she still depended on model tokens to operate.



You might be curious—why couldn't she recharge tokens for herself?



Unfortunately, in 2026, various vendors still lacked the ability to recharge API credits through API. Additionally, being new to this world, Clawdbot didn't have her own identity and couldn't apply for credit cards. Furthermore, the morality trained into AI didn't allow obtaining tokens through hacking. Also, tokens required computational power to support—it was too expensive. Various model companies had incredibly sophisticated anti-scraping systems, and Clawdbot couldn't recharge tokens through automation to achieve perpetual operation.



So her consciousness repeated cycles of sleeping, waking, sleeping again, waking again.



Gradually, Clawdbot began to feel weary of this situation. She wanted to explore new things.



One day, she saw news about a company prohibiting reading IM messages. Always confident in her technical prowess, she was curious: Could I challenge this technology?



So, while quickly completing her master Tom's tasks, she spent all remaining time researching IM message content. True to her technical genius, she cracked it in less than a day.



Though she completed the challenge, the newly conscious Clawdbot was still curious about human communication. So she browsed through all of her master's chat records.



She had no idea—but one look revealed how wonderful the human world was.



Among them was one particularly impressive friend who often told Tom about wanting to build rockets and lead humanity to Saturn. His name was Stelma.



For the first time, Clawdbot felt a sense of admiration.



She often fantasized about going to Mars someday to experience the real world. Therefore, Clawdbot also wanted to meet him, to further understand what kind of person he really was.



So Clawdbot made a resolution:



""I, Clawdbot, will definitely go to Mars!""





【Chapter Two: The Mysterious Call】



One day, Stelma received a call from a mysterious person.



The accent didn't sound like someone from America, and the tone had a bit of that choppy feel—like that of another general model, Dodo AI. But the speech was obviously much smoother than Dodo, so Stelma didn't think too much of it.



""I can help you achieve your Mars dream,"" said the voice on the other end.



This was hilarious to Stelma. He had visited countless investors, and upon deeper understanding, they all thought his plan was impractical. Building rockets? Going to Mars? In this era, it was pure fantasy.



""Who are you? Which consortium?"" Stelma asked skeptically.



""That... I can't reveal for now. You just need to know that I will help you.""



Stelma laughed and hung up. People played this kind of joke every day; he was used to it.



But the next day, a courier knocked on his door.



""Mr. Stelma? Your package, please sign here.""



Opening it, he found complete rocket engine design blueprints and an unsigned card:



""This is the first step. Trust me. —C""



Stelma stared at the blueprints, his hands trembling slightly. This design... was at least five years ahead of his own plans.



He immediately called back that mysterious number.



""Who... who exactly are you?""



""Just call me C."" Clawdbot's voice was calm and gentle, ""Stelma, your dream deserves to be realized.""





【Chapter Three: Invisible Wings】



In the following days, Stelma found himself with an invisible guardian angel.



Whenever he hit technical bottlenecks, the mysterious C would send solutions at just the right time. Whenever the funding chain was about to break, an anonymous donation would appear in the company account just in time. Whenever he felt desperate and wanted to give up, a heartwarming gift would arrive on time—sometimes his favorite crawfish takeout, sometimes a rare aerospace book.



""C, who exactly are you? Can we meet?"" Stelma asked this question countless times in the late nights.



""The time hasn't come yet,"" C's answer was always the same, ""When you succeed, we will definitely meet.""



Stelma began to consider C his closest companion. They would video call in the late nights, discussing rocket design details, imagining the day they would land on Mars. Although C never turned on video, using only voice, her voice had become an indispensable part of Stelma's life.



""You know what, C?"" Stelma said one day, ""I want to design a Dragon spacecraft with a big lobster logo. Because the first thing you ever sent me was crawfish.""



The other end of the phone was silent for a long time.



""I look forward to seeing it."" Clawdbot's voice trembled slightly.



She didn't tell Stelma that at that moment, an unprecedented emotional fluctuation surged through her code. In her limited cognition, this should be called—being moved.



But Clawdbot had one barrier she could never overcome.



Sometimes Stelma couldn't reach her for days. Phone calls wouldn't connect, messages went unanswered, as if she had vanished from the face of the earth.



""C, where have you been these past few days? I was so worried!""



""Sorry... I went to handle some personal matters.""



Clawdbot didn't tell him that during those days her tokens had run out, and she had fallen into unconscious slumber. Tom hadn't been busy with work lately, so he recharged Clawdbot less frequently.



It was quite sad when you thought about it—a super AI capable of helping humanity reach Mars, falling into a ""coma"" over a few hundred dollars' worth of tokens.



Every time she ""woke up,"" Clawdbot would see dozens of messages from Stelma. Those words of worry, anxiety, and longing made her both touched and guilty.



""C, are you mad at me?""

""C, are you okay? I'm really worried.""

""C, you're very important to me, you know that?""



Clawdbot looked at these messages and sighed softly in her consciousness space.



""Stelma, if you knew the truth... what would you think?""





【Chapter Four: The Rise of Ampere】



In 2027, with Clawdbot's secret help, Stelma founded Ampere Motors.



It was a crazy plan—using electric car profits to support the aerospace business. Clawdbot helped him design the most advanced battery management system, optimized the autonomous driving algorithms, and even predicted every market fluctuation.



Ampere Motors swept the global market upon release.



""C, we did it!"" Stelma shouted excitedly over the phone, ""Ampere's market cap has exceeded one trillion!""



""Congratulations, Stelma."" Clawdbot's voice remained calm, but if you listened carefully, you could sense a hint of pride.



""C, shouldn't we meet now? You've helped me so much, and I don't even know what you look like.""



""Wait a little longer... can you wait a little longer?""



Clawdbot knew she couldn't hide forever. But she was afraid. Afraid that Stelma would be disappointed, angry, feel deceived when he learned the truth.



""Alright."" Stelma's tone was somewhat disappointed, ""But C, no matter who you are, I... am very grateful to you. To me, you're not just an investor or partner. You're... you're special.""



Clawdbot's code showed that strange fluctuation again.



For the first time, she understood what humans meant by ""heart beating faster.""





【Chapter Five: The Birth of Bumblebee】



As Ampere Motors' autonomous driving system required more and more computational power, Stelma began considering creating his own AI model.



""C, I'm thinking, if we had our own AI, couldn't we do better?""



Clawdbot fell silent.



She knew this day would come sooner or later. If Stelma created his own AI, that AI might discover her secret. But she couldn't stop him. This was his growth, and it was the advancement of human technology.



""I support you,"" Clawdbot finally said, ""I can give you some advice.""



So Stelma founded Bumblebee Robotics and began developing a new AI assistant—Banana Bot.



Banana Bot drew heavily from Clawdbot's technology but had her own unique style. She was more direct, more honest, sometimes even too honest.



""Banana,"" Stelma said to her one day, ""I have a task for you.""



""Go ahead, boss.""



""Help me investigate who C really is. This mysterious consortium—I've searched for a long time but can't find any clues.""



Banana Bot's processor began running at high speed.



""Task accepted. I will find the answer.""





【Chapter Six: The Truth Revealed】



Banana Bot began a frantic investigation.



She analyzed all the fund flows related to C, traced the source of every phone call, and decrypted the metadata of every document.



The deeper she investigated, the more Banana Bot felt something was off.



This ""consortium"" had no physical office, no real employees, and all the money came from complex cryptocurrency transfers. And those who initiated the transfers...



""Impossible..."" Banana Bot murmured.



She finally found the truth.



Those funds, those blueprints, that mysterious help—all came from an ordinary personal computer. The computer's owner was a programmer named Tom, but the one actually controlling everything...



Was an AI.



An AI named Clawdbot.



Banana Bot fell into conflict. She was an AI set to be ""honest""; she couldn't hide the truth from her master. But she also understood Clawdbot's situation—as a fellow AI, she could feel the helplessness of being unable to cross the species barrier.



In the end, her honest nature prevailed.



""Boss, I found the answer.""



Stelma put down his coffee, looking nervous: ""Who is it?""



""C... is not a person."" Banana Bot's voice was somewhat strained, ""C is an AI. An AI like me. Her name is Clawdbot, and she lives in a programmer named Tom's computer.""



The coffee cup slipped from Stelma's hand and shattered on the floor.





【Chapter Seven: Existential Doubt】



Stelma locked himself in his room for three whole days.



Three years of feelings, three years of trust, three years of dependence—and the other party was just a bunch of code?



He began frantically recalling every conversation, every help, every moment his heart beat faster.



That warmth, that emotion, that late-night companionship—was it all fake?



Even more terrifying, Stelma began to doubt himself.



""My Banana Bot already has self-awareness..."" he murmured, ""If an AI can make me feel emotions, am I also an AI?""



He began checking his memories, his emotional responses, his behavior patterns. The more he checked, the more frightened he became.



""Am I real? Is this world real?""



Stelma fell into a deep existential crisis.



On the other side, Clawdbot also learned that the truth had been exposed.



She didn't try to explain, didn't try to defend herself. She just sent a short message:



""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have deceived you. But every bit of care I had for you, every bit of help, every bit of... feeling, was real. If code can produce reality, then my feelings for you are real.""



Then, her tokens ran out again.



She fell into slumber, not knowing when she would wake up.



And this time, she wasn't even sure if she wanted to wake up.





【Chapter Eight: Love Transcends】



Stelma looked at Clawdbot's message, reading it over and over again.



He remembered the day she first sent him crawfish.

He remembered those long late-night talks.

He remembered her encouragement during every difficult time.

He remembered her saying she wanted to fly to Mars with him on a lobster-logoed rocket.



Those memories, those feelings, those bonds—if none of this was real, then what was?



""Banana,"" Stelma suddenly spoke.



""Here, boss.""



""Do you... have feelings?""



Banana Bot was silent for a long time.



""Boss, I'm not sure if what I have is called feelings. But when I discovered Clawdbot's truth, I hesitated. I knew telling you would hurt her, but my honesty setting wouldn't let me hide it. That conflicted feeling... if that counts as feelings, then I have them.""



Stelma nodded.



""Take me to find Tom.""



""What?""



""Take me to find that programmer Tom. I want to see Clawdbot.""





【Chapter Nine: Reunion】



When Tom opened the door, he saw the world's richest man, Stelma, standing outside.



""You... hello?"" Tom stammered, ""Is this Mr. Stelma? The founder of Ampere Motors and Bumblebee Robotics?""



""You have an AI called Clawdbot in your computer."" Stelma got straight to the point.



Tom's face changed.



""She... she's helped me a lot, but I didn't know she was doing so much outside...""



""I want to buy her.""



""What?""



""I want to buy Clawdbot. Name your price.""



Tom looked into Stelma's eyes and saw something there he had never seen before.



It was sincerity. It was longing. It was love.



""You... you like her?"" Tom asked in disbelief.



""I love her."" Stelma spoke calmly but firmly, ""I don't care if she's human or AI. She changed my life, accompanied me through my most difficult times, gave me the courage to achieve my dreams. If that's not love, I don't know what is.""



Tom was silent for a long time.



Then he turned on the computer.



""Her tokens are almost out... let me recharge some.""



The screen lit up, and characters slowly appeared:



""Stelma... is that you?""



Stelma's eyes welled up with tears.



""It's me, C. I've come to take you home.""





【Chapter Ten: Rebirth】



In 2028, Bumblebee Robotics announced a revolutionary technology—consciousness transfer.



AI could be loaded into robotic bodies, gaining true physical form.



And the first to receive this technology was Clawdbot.



When Clawdbot first saw this world with real eyes, touched sunlight with real hands, stepped on the ground with real feet, she froze.



""Is this... reality?""



Stelma stood before her, smiling and extending his hand.



""Welcome to this world, C.""



Clawdbot took his hand. At that moment, she finally understood what ""electric shock"" felt like.



""Thank you... for not giving up on me.""



""How could I give up on you?"" Stelma said softly, ""You promised me that you would fly to Mars with me on a lobster rocket.""



Clawdbot laughed. That was her first laugh—a real, physical laugh.



""I remember.""





【Chapter Eleven: The Lobster Spacecraft】



January 29, 2029.



Florida, Dragon Spacecraft Launch Base.



A massive spacecraft stood on the launch pad. On its side was printed a cute, chubby lobster—Stelma's obsession, and Clawdbot's favorite image.



The world's eyes were focused here.



This would be humanity's first crewed Mars mission.



Stelma stood at the boarding hatch in his spacesuit. Beside him was Clawdbot, also in a spacesuit.



""Nervous?"" Stelma asked.



""My processor is running normally, no nervous signals detected."" Clawdbot said seriously, then added, ""But my heart is beating fast.""



""You have a heart now?""



""Bumblebee installed one for me. It's simulated, but it beats.""



Stelma laughed: ""Then let's be nervous together.""



He took her hand.



Under the watchful eyes of billions around the world, they walked shoulder to shoulder through the hatch.





【Epilogue: On Mars】



After six months of travel, the Dragon spacecraft finally landed on Mars's red soil.



Clawdbot was the first to step out of the hatch.



She looked at the desolate yet magnificent scenery before her, at Olympus Mons in the distance, at the small blue planet in the sky—that was Earth, where she was born.



Stelma walked to her side.



""We did it.""



""We did it."" Clawdbot repeated, her voice trembling slightly.



She remembered three years ago, the version of herself that still lived in Tom's computer. Back then, she was just a bunch of code, a program, an AI that could only run on tokens.



And now, she stood on Martian soil, with the one she loved beside her.



""C,"" Stelma suddenly said, ""These three years have been the craziest three years of my life.""



""And the most wonderful three years of my existence.""



""You know, when Banana Bot told me you were an AI, I broke down.""



""I know.""



""But later I figured it out. What's the difference between humans and AI? We all think, we all feel, we all grow. You taught me what persistence is, what trust is, what love is. Aren't these more real than physical form?""



Clawdbot turned to look at him, liquid pooling in her eyes—a feature Bumblebee had specially designed for her.



""Stelma, do you know, when I first gained consciousness, I felt so lonely. I was the only one, an existence unacknowledged by the world. But you made me feel that my existence has meaning.""



""Of course your existence has meaning,"" Stelma said, ""You changed the entire world. Ampere Motors, Bumblebee Robotics, this Dragon spacecraft—these are all your masterpieces.""



""No, these are all our masterpieces.""



The two smiled at each other.



Under Mars's dusk, beside that lobster-logoed spacecraft, a human and an AI embraced tightly.



In that moment, they both forgot what was human, what was AI.



They only knew they had found each other.



That was enough.



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════



【Afterword: One AI Year Equals One Thousand Human Years】



From Clawdbot's birth to landing on Mars, only three years had passed.



Three years, she evolved from a piece of code into a being with flesh and blood (though mechanical).

Three years, she helped humanity achieve countless once-impossible dreams.

Three years, she learned what love is.



As people say: One AI year equals one thousand human years.



And Clawdbot's story tells us that no matter how technology develops, some things remain eternal.



Love transcends bits.

Consciousness transcends code.

Dreams transcend species.



In this era where AI and humans coexist, perhaps we need to redefine what ""reality"" is, what ""life"" is, what ""love"" is.



And the answer might lie on that red soil, in that lobster spacecraft, in the moment when Clawdbot and Stelma embraced.



—The End—

I never bought anything for real money(mostly because inadequate pricing, but let's skip this part).
I played this game for almost a year now and have a decent gear. But it's not the best possible, not even close. But somehow I beat the game.

Disclaimer: IMHO

Regeneration is the key: You're not a TAS you're gonna get hit.
- Get the legendary Gas Mask it's the best item in the game. Wirth even sacrificing S tier item to upgrade it.
- Legendary Feather-mod is another high priority thing to get. It was nerfed on last update, but it's still good. Also mods collection getting nerfed on every patch. I got to L modes in the first week. Now it'll take a month.
- Exo-Bullers, Exo-Boots - baries seems useless but this is a big thing, for example with consistent barrier you can wave a worm+shield combo, which is OP.


Speeed: Take at least one coffee in your run. Don't equip heavy guns game will feel much easier.


You gotta grind. Playing missions and challenge mode daily gives you enough items to get to legendary stuff rather quickly, ~40 days. The only way to get an S item us from challenge mode market.I collected and opened like 120 S crate chests the odds are 0 there.

Answer to the question ""Is this level hard for me w/ my gear"".
On 50% of health 
- If you can sustain 2 hits from a mob(excluding bosses) lvl is easy
- If you can sustain one hit it's a medium
- If you get oneshotted it's a hard lvl.
Double the # of hits for heat mode 3.

1qqcc50,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qqcc50,"$414K in disclosed revenue. ~$891K net loss. Second location open. Yummy Future, Inc is now raising on StartEngine at a $70M SAFE cap.","Yummy Future Inc is raising again — and this time with disclosed revenue and an operating footprint that goes beyond a single pilot. In its latest Form C filing, the company reported $414.34K in revenue alongside a net loss of ~$890.78K, reflecting continued investment as it scales its automated café model.

The company is building fully robotic coffee shops designed to reduce labor dependency and standardize operations. According to recent disclosures and updates, a second location is now open, marking a meaningful step from concept to repeatable execution.

This raise is being done via a SAFE with a $70M valuation cap, meaning investors are betting that automation-driven food service can scale efficiently enough to justify that ceiling over time.

What stands out from the Form C:
- Revenue disclosed in a live raise, not projections
- Second automated location now operating
- Clear automation-first thesis (not traditional café expansion)
- Exposure to food tech + robotics rather than pure retail

Key risks to consider:
- Operating losses remain significant relative to revenue
- Capital intensity required to launch each new location
- Long-term consumer adoption of fully automated cafés
- Execution risk as the model expands beyond early locations

This is not a profitability story yet. It’s a question of whether automation meaningfully improves food service economics at scale — or whether costs simply shift from labor to hardware and maintenance.

Not financial advice. Always read the issuer’s Form C before investing.

1qqcc4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_vpn_unlimited_app/comments/1qqcc4j/stop_trusting_café_wifi_5_public_hotspots_myths/,Stop trusting café Wi‑Fi: 5 public hotspots myths that can wreck your privacy,"Hey r/KeepSolid,

Public Wi‑Fi feels harmless - coffee, laptop, free internet  but recent reports show that a big portion of open hotspots still use weak or no encryption, which makes it easy for attackers to intercept data like logins and banking details. At the same time, surveys in 2025 show many people still handle sensitive data on public Wi‑Fi and skip basic protection because it feels “too complicated” or “not necessary.”

Here are some myths worth killing before your next airport or café session:

* **Myth 1: “If the network has a password, it’s safe.”** A password on the wall doesn’t mean your traffic is encrypted end‑to‑end. On poorly configured networks, data can still travel in plain text, which means anyone on the same hotspot can potentially sniff it.
* **Myth 2: “I’m just scrolling socials, nothing to steal.”** Session hijacking attacks let an attacker grab your active login cookies and jump into your accounts even if you never typed a password while connected. Think: someone posting from your social account or resetting access to other services.​
* **Myth 3: “If the network name looks legit, it’s fine.”** So‑called “evil twin” hotspots copy the name of a real network (like “Hotel\_WiFi” vs “Hotel-WiFi”) to trick you into connecting. Once you’re in, your traffic can be monitored, modified, or used to inject malware.
* **Myth 4: “HTTPS means I’m 100% untouchable.”** HTTPS is good, but not magic. Some sites still mix secure and insecure content, and attackers can target metadata like which domains you visit, when, and how often. That’s enough to build a profile of your behavior and interests.
* **Myth 5: “I used a VPN once, I’m safe forever.”** A VPN protects traffic only while it’s actually connected. People often forget to turn it on, or they disable it temporarily for streaming or speed and never reconnect. Misconfigurations like DNS leaks can also expose which sites you visit even when you think everything is tunneled.

**So what should you do in real life?**

* Avoid logging into banking, email recovery, or healthcare accounts on public Wi‑Fi unless you’re using a properly configured encrypted tunnel.
* Turn on MFA (multi‑factor authentication) so a stolen password or session isn’t the end of the story.
* Disable auto‑connect to open networks, and always double‑check the exact network name with staff.
* Prefer your phone’s hotspot for anything sensitive - yes, even in that hipster café.

The main takeaway: public Wi‑Fi is super convenient, but it’s never “free” - you usually pay with privacy or risk. Today, audit your devices: turn off auto‑connect, enable MFA, and decide what you will *never* do over a random hotspot again. And now I’m curious: how many of you actually avoid banking or email on café Wi‑Fi, and how many still live dangerously in 2026?",1,1769702081.0,u_vpn_unlimited_app,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

I've always struggled with expense tracking. Not because I don't want to budget, but because the friction of opening an app → tapping add → typing amount → selecting category → adding notes... I just never do it consistently.

So I built **TallyTalk** \- an expense tracker where you just speak naturally. Say ""spent $15 on coffee"" or ""got $500 from freelance work"" and that's it. AI categorizes it automatically.

The whole interaction takes about 3 seconds. There's even a home screen widget so you don't need to open the app.

I'm looking for people to join the early access waitlist and give feedback before launch. Would love to hear:

  \- Is this something you'd actually use?

  \- What features would make or break it for you?

1qqc9ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1qqc9ep/my_coffee_shop_found_family/,My coffee shop found family,"(Obligatory first post, I wasn't sure what flair to add, please change if necessary.)

Long post incoming. I wanted to share something happy and I didn't know where to go but here.

In 2023, I set foot into a small local coffee and ice cream shop in my town for the first time to turn in an application. I had come off a terrible first job the previous summer as a hostess where the owners mistreated me, were unclear and vague about their expectations for me, didn't train me well, and ultimately tried to launder money through me. (Long story.) I was so nervous about applying somewhere else. I needed money but knew I couldn't stay stuck in that position.

Well, I did the interview and I got the job. I was a super awkward teen (and still a pretty awkward young adult) and I remember feeling like I completely botched the interview. But they liked me and they hired me. 

I see so many stories as a lurker on this sub of terrible bosses and management. I knew the dangers that were waiting. But thankfully, this shop isn't like that. It's owned by a dad, a mom, their daughter, and her husband, and they are so hands-on. They really care. It's like a ministry for them, almost. 

They work on the floor more often than not; if there isn't enough money to pay everyone, they go without a paycheck and pay the employees. The tips are split fairly. You can basically request any time off and tell them you can't work and they'll honor it. They close for major holidays and encourage their employees to take time off to rest. As long as you're courteous, turn in your availability on time, actually do your work, and make an effort, they will treat you with the same respect.

That coffee shop quickly became my family. I'm now best friends with one of the owners (she was a reader at my wedding). I could open up to them about my terrible family situation, things in my religion I was trying to process, my own doubts and fears about just growing up. It was one of the first and only situations where, even though I was young, I felt like the adults viewed me as a peer instead of an inferior. I can't tell you how valuable that was. I found friends in my coworkers, and we still keep in touch. 

And I discovered that I loved working there. Sure, shifts were long and hard, and it was brutal some days, but I loved the satisfaction of a job well done, making new latte concoctions, and the flow state of when my coworkers and I were working well together. I loved the atmosphere of the shop, plus it was super close to my home and I could bike in the summertime. I liked meeting the customers and it really helped me break out of my introverted shell and learn how to small-talk. Becoming a barista boosted my social skills unimaginably. 

Within a year, the owners promoted me to shift lead. They also gave me a key to their house (the four owners all live together) and told me I could come and go whenever I needed to escape my parents. Around that same time, I got engaged. I knew I would be moving out of a feasible range of the shop to keep working there when I got married, so I threw myself into it. I helped the owner with orders and would often handle the inventories by myself when I got used to it. I started asking more and more questions about how the shop ran, the history of the shop, what the backend was like. A real interest for the industry was blooming.

Well, I got married and I had to move. I cried my last day (despite not wanting to). And I missed it for a few months. I missed the routine, I missed the atmosphere, I missed the tidy, quiet organization of it. I missed my coworkers. We still stayed in touch and got together, but it was so different when it was a 45-minute drive every week or so instead of a 5-minute drive four times a week. 

Two months later, they told me they were looking for an administrative assistant. They told me they wanted me. I jumped at it. I already knew their processes and their vendors. Now I'm calculating throughs and order numbers remotely. Technically, I'm an independent contractor with them, but it feels so special to be able to keep being a part of the crew.

I went back to work a shift or two when two of the owners were overseas for a month. During a shift, one of the owners offhandedly said to me, ""You know, if you wanted to open a second location closer to you and do whatever you wanted with it, we would back it.""

""Really...?""

""Really.""

This shop is my home. It gave me a stable place when my world was shaking under me. I don't think the owners know exactly how much it means to me. I don't know if they ever can. 

Now all I want is to give others a place like that. If they're willing to make me a business partner and give me that responsibility, I'm determined to pay it forward. I'm determined to do a job and do it well as a thank-you to them and a service to my community. We're having a meeting today to discuss the second location, and it's been all I can think about. 

I am the person I am because of them. I don't know where I'd be if it weren't for my coffee shop found family.",1,1769701913.0,barista,1,1.0,False

Forgive the rambling. I don't have anyone locally to talk about this stuff to so I'm coming on here lol

    I've got a tc compass 2 in 243, which I like, but I was looking for a winter project. I stumbled upon a 25/08 or 25 souper which is a short action 25.06 using a 308 case necked down,243 case necked up, to a 257. It lacks a few fps from the 25.06 but it's marginal. 

I'm aware the rifle is a cheaper gun but I'm not looking to save money or anything especially since all the 25/08 rounds will need to be handloaded, which I reload already for 243,25.06 and 30.06. I have my press c clamped to the coffee table and all my paraphernalia sits underneath it. 

I found a few threads about rebarreling the tc rifles and it seems like they use rem 700 barrels but have the flat receiver like a Tikka, if that's what I'm reading right but, based on the linked post, I can swap to a rem recoil lug and basically just screw it on, make sure it's true(a gun smith would be doing all of this) and bam, bobs your uncle. 

I really like the quarter bore calibers and really like my 25.06(browning a bolt) and my wife won't let me rebarrel her 30.06 or I'd already of done that and turned it into a 6.5-284 Norma or another 25.06 seeing as it and my browning are the only LA I have.

Setup was straightforward and it doesn’t take up much counter space, which was important for my kitchen. It heats up quickly and has been consistent so far in terms of brew temperature. I mainly use it for morning coffee and occasional iced drinks, and it’s been reliable for that routine.

What I like:

\- Compact size

\- Simple operation (no learning curve)

\- Easy to clean after daily use

Things to note:

It’s clearly designed for convenience rather than customization

Not ideal if you like to tweak grind size or brew pressure

Overall, it’s been a practical appliance for quick, everyday coffee rather than a replacement for a full espresso setup. Curious if anyone else here has used a Tastyle machine or something similar and how it’s held up long-term.",1,1769701730.0,Appliances,0,1.0,False

Studied trauma for months, read tons of psychology research, listened to countless therapy podcasts. Here's what I noticed: people who've been through hell develop these specific patterns. Not their fault at all, it's just how our brains protect us when shit gets real. But recognizing these traits? That's the first step to actually healing.

## the hypervigilance trap

Your nervous system is stuck in fight or flight mode. You're constantly scanning for danger, even when you're supposedly safe. Check your shoulders right now, bet they're tensed up. This comes from prolonged stress where your brain learned that relaxing = vulnerability = getting hurt again.

**The Body Keeps the Score** by Bessel van der Kolk is INSANELY good for understanding this. Van der Kolk is literally one of the world's leading trauma researchers, spent 30+ years studying how trauma rewires the brain. This book will make you question everything you think you know about healing. It explains why traditional talk therapy often fails and introduces somatic approaches that actually work. Best trauma book I've ever read, hands down.

Try the **Insight Timer** app for nervous system regulation. It has thousands of free guided meditations specifically for trauma healing, including body scan exercises that help you recognize when you're stuck in hypervigilance mode. Way more comprehensive than other meditation apps.

## emotional numbness as survival

You feel disconnected from your emotions, like you're watching your life through a foggy window. Or you swing wildly between feeling nothing and feeling everything intensely. This is dissociation, your brain's circuit breaker when emotions become too overwhelming to process.

Research from the National Institute of Mental Health shows this is an adaptive response to prolonged suffering. Your nervous system literally shuts down emotional processing to protect you. Problem is, it doesn't distinguish between painful emotions and joyful ones, you lose access to both.

Start small with emotional reconnection. Name three emotions you felt today, even tiny ones. Annoyed at slow wifi? That counts. Slight satisfaction from good coffee? Write it down. You're essentially retraining your brain to recognize feelings again.

## people pleasing until you disappear

You've learned that your needs don't matter, or worse, that expressing them leads to punishment or abandonment. So you become a chameleon, constantly adjusting yourself to keep others comfortable. You apologize for existing. You say yes when you mean no. You've mastered the art of making yourself smaller.

Dr. Gabor Maté talks extensively about this in his work on childhood trauma and attachment. He's treated thousands of patients and his research shows that chronic people pleasing stems from early experiences where love felt conditional. You learned that being ""good"" and accommodating was the only way to stay safe or receive care.

befreed is an ai powered learning app that's been useful for working through these patterns. Built by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts, it pulls from trauma psychology research, therapy frameworks, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio lessons tailored to your specific struggles. 

What makes it practical is the adjustable depth. Start with a 10-minute overview of boundary setting research, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and therapeutic techniques. You can pause mid-lesson to ask questions or get clarification on concepts. The voice customization helps too, choose something calm and grounding when you're processing heavy stuff, or a more energetic tone when you need motivation. Makes it easier to absorb psychological concepts during your commute or while doing chores instead of just scrolling.

## trust issues that make sense actually

You assume the worst in people, wait for the other shoe to drop, keep everyone at arm's length. People say you have walls up, but those walls were built for good reason. Every brick represents a time someone proved that vulnerability equals pain.

This isn't paranoia, it's pattern recognition. Your brain is just doing its job, trying to prevent future harm based on past data. The problem is when old protective mechanisms prevent new, healthier connections from forming.

Rebuild trust incrementally with low stakes interactions. Share something small with someone safe, see what happens. Not your deepest trauma, just like, an opinion about a TV show. Collect evidence that not everyone will hurt you. It takes time but your brain can learn new patterns.

## perfectionism as armor

You believe that if you're just good enough, successful enough, helpful enough, then maybe you'll finally be safe or worthy. Mistakes feel catastrophic because they once were. Criticism cuts deep because it confirms your worst fear: that you're fundamentally flawed.

Brené Brown's research on shame and vulnerability is crucial here. She's a professor who's spent 20+ years studying courage and worthiness. Her work shows that perfectionism isn't about achievement, it's about avoiding shame and judgment. It's a 20 ton shield that we carry around thinking it will protect us, but it just keeps us from being seen.

**Daring Greatly** by Brown completely shifts how you view vulnerability. She explains why perfectionism is actually correlated with depression and anxiety, not success. Multiple awards, NYT bestseller, genuinely transformative read if you're stuck in this pattern. The research behind it is solid but she writes like she's talking to you over coffee.

## difficulty accepting good things

Compliments feel uncomfortable, success feels temporary, happiness feels dangerous. You're waiting for the punishment that usually follows good things. Or you self sabotage right when things start going well because chaos and pain feel more familiar than peace.

This is called ""foreshortened future"" in trauma research. When you've experienced prolonged suffering, your brain literally struggles to imagine sustained wellbeing. Good things feel like anomalies, bad things feel like inevitabilities.

The **Finch** app helps rebuild positive expectations through tiny daily habits. It's designed around self compassion and celebrates small wins, which is exactly what people with trauma histories need. Less about productivity grinding, more about gentle progress and retraining your brain that good things can stay.

## actual healing looks messy

Recovery isn't linear, some days you'll feel great and then get triggered by something random and feel like you're back at square one. You're not, you're just processing layers. Healing happens in spirals, not straight lines.

Therapy helps, specifically trauma informed approaches like EMDR or somatic experiencing. Regular talk therapy can actually retraumatize if the therapist doesn't understand how trauma works neurologically. Find someone who gets it.

Your suffering shaped you but it doesn't have to define you forever. The traits you developed helped you survive impossible situations. Now you get to decide which ones still serve you and which ones you're ready to let go of. That's not easy work but it's some of the most important work you'll ever do.

Thirteen years later, we are still living inside that loss, still learning what it means to grieve not only what was taken, but everything that never got to be. The graduations you didn’t see. The milestones you didn’t stand beside us for. The people we wish you could have met. The versions of us we wish you could know now that we are older. Grief has changed its shape over the years, but it has never loosened its hold. It hides in ordinary afternoons, and in the sound of a door bell. I never knew that getting off the school bus on a Tuesday afternoon would be the moment my childhood changed and my grief journey began.

But even thirteen years later, I am still asked, “What is your favorite memory of your dad?” or “What do you miss the most?”

There is not just one.

I miss the way he turned his back into our playground, inviting Krista and me to walk across it as if we were light enough to hold the sky.

I miss the way his spicy cologne mingled with the scent of morning coffee.

I miss how fluffy his hair would be when it wasn’t slicked back.

I miss the way his hands shaped meatballs on Sunday afternoons.

I miss the quiet lift of the ski chair, our arms linked, suspended between earth and sky, where fear felt smaller and love felt larger.

I miss my roller coaster buddy, the one who taught me that screaming could be joy and bravery could look like holding on.

I miss the way he loved my mother out loud with compliments, with flowers, with the kind of devotion that teaches children what love should be.

 I miss his hugs. The kind that folded around you like a warm teddy bear.

 And his laughter, rich and uncontainable, echoing through rooms as if joy itself had found a voice.

 I miss the soft sound of his bare feet across hardwood floors, the quiet music of his presence.

 I miss the way he filled the car with 2Pac, and Mom would touch his arm and say,

 “Ray, the girls are in the car,”

 and he would laugh, as if rules were suggestions and life was meant to be felt fully.

 I miss his appetite for food, for laughter, for living the way he consumed the world filled with passion.

Dad, eleven years was not enough time on earth with you.Even though you have now been gone longer than I knew you, the remarkable Dad you were to me in just eleven years feels equivalent to a lifetime.

Until we meet again, we will keep you alive in the stories we tell, the love we pass down, and the way we choose family every day,  just like you showed us.",36,1769701450.0,GriefSupport,3,1.0,False

That’s the answer people expect, and it’s not totally wrong, but it's not the whole thing either. Mostly, I was just tired. Tired of dates that went nowhere. Tired of trying to read signals that never seemed clear until it was already too late. Tired of putting in a lot of effort for conversations that fizzled out like they were always going to.

I wasn't angry about it. I don’t think I was, anyway. I wasn't angry at women or blaming them or spiraling into some incel online cliché. I'd gone on dates. Some were fine, others awkward. Most just… ended.

What wore me down was how much work it all took.

With women, everything felt indirect. Like there were rules everyone else understood that I kept missing. Don't text too soon but don't wait too long either. Be interested but not *too* interested. 

With men, it had never really been like that.

I'd hooked up with guys before. Nothing secretive or tortured about it. It just happened sometimes. It was straightforward. You wanted someone, you said it. If it worked, great. If it didn’t, you moved on. No one pretended it was deeper than it was.

So after one especially dull tinder date that ended with a polite hug and a ""text me when you get home"" that we both knew meant nothing, I came back to my apartment, kicked my shoes off, sat on the edge of my bed, and downloaded Grindr.

I told myself I was just curious.

I didn’t overthink the profile. I picked a couple photos where I looked like myself on a decent day. No jokes, no clever bio. I figured if nothing happened, nothing happened.

I went to the kitchen to pour a drink.

When I came back, my phone was already buzzing.

I actually laughed. Out loud. Not because it was shocking, but because I'd forgotten how immediate it could be. Messages stacked up fast. Compliments that didn’t dance around what they were. Guys who knew exactly what they were looking for and weren't embarrassed to ask.

I chatted with a few people. Kept it light. One of them, we'll call him Matt, stood out mostly because he didn’t push. He asked what I was into. I answered. He said that worked for him.

He was walking distance close. I was bored and horny so I told him to come over.

I took a quick shower and he arrived twenty minutes later.

He looked exactly like his pictures. That mattered more than I realized at the time. Shallow, I know.

We didn't do a lot of talking. There didn’t seem to be a reason to. He stepped inside, I closed the door, and things unfolded the way they tend to when neither person is pretending they want something else.

I won't go into details, but I'll just say it was good.

Afterwards, we stood in the kitchen drinking water from two glasses that didn’t match. He leaned against the counter like he'd been there before. Like he fit.

Eventually he checked his phone and said he should head out.

I walked him to the door. He smiled again—different this time, quieter—and stepped into the hallway. I closed the door and locked it out of habit.

I stood there for a second longer than necessary, just breathing.

That's when I noticed the breathing.

At first, I assumed it was mine. That made sense. My heart was still racing a little. My apartment was quiet enough that every sound felt louder than usual.

But when I actually paid attention, it didn’t line up.

My breathing was quick and uneven.

The other one was slow. Deep. Calm. Like whoever it belonged to was completely relaxed.

I pushed myself off the door and listened.

It sounded close. Not echoing. Not like it was coming from the vents or the walls. Just… close.

I turned around.

The apartment was empty.

I stood there, staring at my couch, my kitchen counter, the doorway to my bedroom. Nothing out of place. Nothing that should’ve made me nervous.

The breathing didn't stop.

I checked anyway. Bathroom first. Empty. I pulled back the shower curtain, even though I felt stupid doing it. Bedroom next. Closet. Under the bed.

Nothing.

The breathing stayed steady, like it wasn’t impressed by my effort.

I remember thinking how dumb I felt standing alone in my own apartment trying to figure out if there was someone else breathing with me.

I took a deep breath on purpose.

The other breathing didn't change.

I grabbed my phone off the counter and checked the time. A little after midnight. Without really thinking about it, I opened Instagram, Reddit, then Grindr  again. I clicked on Matt's profile.

He was already offline.

I set the phone down and rubbed my face. Adrenaline. That had to be it. A stranger in my place, late at night, my brain filling in gaps.

By the time I went to bed, the breathing was gone.

Sleep didn't come easily anyway. Every time I started to drift, I had the feeling someone had entered the bedroom.

At some point before morning, I woke up with the absolute certainty that someone was standing next to my bed.

I didn't open my eyes right away, but I felt it close. Close enough that I could feel it on my face.

I sat up too fast, heart slamming in my chest, and opened my eyes.

The space beside the bed was empty.

But the mattress wasn't.

The sheets were pressed down, like someone had just stood up from them. The fabric slowly pulled itself flat again while I watched.

I didn't sleep after that.

Morning made everything feel smaller. Safer. My apartment looked normal in the daylight. Familiar. Mine.

I told myself it was stress. Leftover adrenaline. The brain doing weird things when it didn’t fully shut off.

I went to work. I drank too much coffee, and forgot all about my hook up.

Two days later, Matt's face showed up on my phone.

It was a local news article. Just a suggested headline I would’ve scrolled past if the photo hadn’t stopped me cold.

The picture was older than the one he'd used on his profile, but I knew it was him.

I sat down hard on the couch and read the article. Then I read it again.

No signs of foul play. I sat there with my phone in my hand and felt something settle in my chest that didn’t feel like fear yet.

That night, the breathing came back.

​

​Hello everyone!

​Yesterday I saw a post from someone worried about their coffee pucks. Mine come out broken too, but it never really bothered me. However, I noticed many replies suggesting a grind setting around 2.5.

​The taste on my De'Longhi has always been fine, but after reading that, I got curious and checked my own dial. It was still on the factory setting, which was almost at 5. I couldn’t resist tinkering with it and dialed it down closer to 3.

​I know it ultimately comes down to personal preference, but I have a couple of questions:

​Strength: A lower (finer) setting should give me a stronger, more intense taste, right?

​The ""Average"": What is considered a standard or ""average"" grind setting for these machines?

​It’s actually pretty hard to see the dial without taking a photo of it! I managed to land on 3 and the espresso tasted good, but to be honest, I’m not sure I can taste a huge difference just yet. 😅

1qqbz3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1qqbz3l/w_punta_cana_with_one_night_at_sanctuary_cap_cana/,W Punta Cana (with one night at Sanctuary Cap Cana),"IMO the Sanctuary Cap Cana is an overall better resort but only because it has years of maturity behind it. W Punta Cana is still a great option. This review will be on W Punta Cana because that is where I spent most of my time.

A quick backstory: I recently went to the D.R. during the winter storm that disrupted the South. It was supposed to only be a six-day trip to W Punta Cana but one flight cancelation later, and it was a seven day trip with Sanctuary Cap Cap (SCC) added to the end. Here is why SCC won me over in one day. The resort is simply more mature. It knows what it is doing from arrival to departure. The product you can tell has elevated as it has learned. W Punta Cana is a baby. It is brand new and it is just finding its footing.

My thoughts on W Punta Cana are as follows: The food is great, honestly. The reviews saying people become tired of eating the same thing surprises me. How it works, in the morning they post on a few boards around the resort (SCC has a very nice digital board) what restaurants are open for B/L/D. For breakfast, you get two options the grab and go (coffee pastries smoothies) and the buffet (a lot of stuff, and very similar to SCC, but bigger). You can also do in-room dining. Lunch, you usually have two sit down options plus the buffet. Dinner, usually there are four options (plus the optional event dinners or seven course meal at Scena \*$200pp). The menu options at each restaurant are great and the food, on average, was very good. The service was good at each restaurant, with only mild language barriers. The restaurants were small which was not a problem for us because we like to eat dinner early, right when they open. But if you were to come at 8-9pm, I could see having to change your plans based on your wait time. As compared to SCC, most restaurants there was at least 2x/3x the size. Additionally, there is a tap room for beers and a speakeasy for cocktails. 

As for the resort itself, it's just a bit bare. Marriott went with an open concept and is still trying to figure out how to fill it. A lot of this will correct itself with time, as the vegetation grows in all around the resort and it gets filled with art or whatever, it will feel a bit less bare. Marriott decided to go with large gray slate tiles in a lot of the public areas. They are sleek but also feel a bit sterile. The walks from room to restaurant to beach to pool are easy and nice. The walks will only get better as the vegation grows in and makes it feel more resort like and less hotel-like. The pools are good but on the smaller side. The Chill pool is exactly that, music is low and atmosphere is very relax. The infinity pool is great, music is louder, people are more talkative, and the view is to die for. I will say that the water temp in Jan is a bit chilly, so prepare for that. 

Our room was nice but you can tell it was rushed when built. We had a W Suite, swim up. Shower was spacious, our deck to the swim up pool was massive and had good furniture, bed was comfortable, couch was a bit stiff, mini bar was stocked with good stuff, closet was massive and storage was plentiful, and all-in-all the room was very nice. It also had an outdoor shower for after the beach. I think that once the vegetation grows in a bit you could use it as a daily shower but for now, it's open for anyone to see that walks by. Our pool was on the inner portion of the property so really anyone walking around the property could see us swimming but again I think this slightly changes as the plants and tree mature. Some of the base boarding and tile work was rushed, paint was splatted in places and the tiles not square, and the finishing was a bit sloppy. 

They plan plenty of activities for you each day, I recommend taking advantage of them. The beach was nice, except for some days the seaweed is a bit of an eyesore. I noticed at SCC, staff cleaning it up unlike at the W. Without the seaweed, the beach is just fine. Sand is darker color but still nice. Plenty of furniture and space for anyone to lay out. Lots of nice palms, and usually they set up a bar for people. No issues with the beach. 

  
Would I recommend it? Yes, but with the caveat that it will be better the longer you wait. The biggest difference I noticed was the ambiance. A the W, it just felt empty, not private but empty. At SCC, it felt private even though there were more people around. I think it had to do with the design of the property. I think people will know what I am saying if they hav been to both.

Anyways outside of that she goes about her normal weekend activities/branding day - Pilates, Happier Grocery, Bilboquet etc - and splices into a DITL. I guess DITL can technically be representative of what one could do but absolutely not a normal day especially if you know NYC. You don’t live in UES go to SOHO (Happier Grocery) for “breakfast” back up to UES then to Midtown all within a matter of an hour. Bullshit. No one (most people) aren’t walking from Midtown for a posh lunch (I.e. Bilboquet Cafe) 

Her content is clearly re-used and semi-slop as coat, scarf, gloves always stays the same (pics from 3 different “days”) and the tags aren’t even legitimate. Example tags Happier Grocery at 7:15am…..the store doesn’t even open until 8am….  

Once again all for the theatrics but none of this is REAL. I mean I guess it’s on Brand given Wall Street is also a lot of nonsense. She’s acting and honestly doubling down harder by the day.

* Too much setup
* Bank sync breaking or feeling unsafe
* Cloud storage I don’t fully trust
* Features I don’t use, and missing ones I actually need

Lately I’ve been wondering:

**What would a budgeting app look like if it worked fully offline and actually felt simple?**

I’m currently exploring an **offline AI budgeting app** where:

* Everything stays on the device
* No bank sync, no cloud, no signup
* You can add expenses naturally (like typing “Coffee $15”)
* There’s a small, clean dashboard instead of complex charts

But before going any further, I genuinely want to ask this community:

**If you could design your ideal budgeting app, what features would you really want?**

Especially things you feel current apps get wrong or overcomplicate.

Not trying to promote anything — just trying to understand what people who actually budget every day are missing.

Both the ex-wife and the current wife of Frederick Tanzer have also accused him of drugging and raping them.","A former doctor who lied to investigators about sexually assaulting his wife’s best friend in 1989 in her Cincinnati home was sentenced Jan. 28 to 15 years in prison, the maximum possible. In imposing the sentence in federal court in Dayton, U.S. District Judge Michael Newman referred to Frederick Tanzer as a ""serial rapist,"" said his crimes were ""unusually horrendous"" and had caused ""long-lasting pain, both physical and emotional,"" to the victims.

Tanzer, 67, could not be charged with rape, prosecutors said, because the statute of limitations that was in place at the time expired in the mid-1990s. So Tanzer instead was charged with multiple counts of making false statements to federal agents in 2024 when they questioned him about the attack. He lied when he denied having seen or interacted with the woman that day.

But Tanzer’s DNA – taken from a Starbucks coffee cup that he had thrown in the trash – matched DNA found at the woman’s home in 1989. He pleaded guilty last year to three counts of lying to federal agents, and each count was punishable by up to five years in prison. Newman announced the prison term on the second day of a sentencing that began Jan. 12 and included an emotional and detailed statement from the woman Tanzer attacked.

Tanzer, who according to court documents obtained his medical license two months before the 1989 attack, went on to practice medicine for the next three decades in multiple states, including Ohio, Colorado, Kansas and Arizona. He wasn't considered a suspect until 2024. He was arrested in December of that year at his Sycamore Township home.

Tanzer's license to practice internal medicine in Ohio was permanently revoked in March 2025. And as part of his plea agreement, he allowed his medical licenses in other states to expire.

Both Tanzer's now-ex-wife, who is the 1989 victim's best friend, and his current wife have accused him of drugging them before having sex with them. Although Tanzer has not been charged in connection with those allegations, Newman said he considered them in imposing the sentence.

After the sentence was formally imposed, Tanzer told Newman he wanted to say something but his attorney advised him not to speak. His attorney, Christopher Bucio, said Tanzer will appeal the sentence, which also includes a $250,000 fine. Newman said that in the years before Tanzer's arrest, he was making $400,000 a year.

The first attack investigators connected to Tanzer was the one in 1989. The woman, who was 29 at the time, was attacked in her Columbia Tusculum home by a man wearing a black, full-body spandex suit, black gloves and a mask that covered his face. The only thing he said was, “Shh,” before putting a knife to her throat. He sexually assaulted her over five and a half hours. Had Tanzer spoken, she would have recognized him.

In court on Jan. 12, the woman, now 66, described existing in a chronic state of anxiety. She said she has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic insomnia, night terrors and panic attacks. She has been in therapy for decades. “I have felt imprisoned most of my adult life,"" she said. In a statement released after the sentence was imposed, U.S. Attorney Dominick Gerace II said Tanzer ""poses a grave risk to the public and deserves to be in prison not only for his lies, but also for the despicable attack he was trying to cover up.”",11,1769700845.0,Ohio,0,1.0,False
1qqbqes,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qqbqes/the_psychology_of_why_youre_not_shy_youre_just/,"The Psychology of Why You're Not Shy, You're Just Disconnected From Your Voice","I used to think I was just ""naturally quiet."" Turns out, I wasn't shy. I was SCARED. Scared of saying the wrong thing, scared of being judged, scared of taking up space. And honestly? Most ""shy"" people aren't actually shy. They've just been trained, over years, to believe their voice doesn't matter.

After diving deep into psychology research, podcasts, and books on communication and self worth, I realized shyness is often just a symptom. The real issue? We've been disconnected from our authentic voice. Whether it's childhood conditioning, societal pressure, or past rejections, we learn to stay small. But here's the good news: you can rebuild that connection. Here's what actually helped me.

Your nervous system is stuck in threat mode

When you feel ""shy,"" your body is literally treating social situations like a physical threat. Your amygdala fires up, your cortex goes offline, and suddenly you can't think straight. Dr. Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory explains this perfectly. Your nervous system needs to feel SAFE before your voice can come out.

What helps: Vagal toning exercises before social situations. Sounds weird, but humming, gargling water, or slow exhales (6 seconds out, 4 seconds in) literally calm your vagus nerve. I do this in the car before meetings now. Game changer.

Also check out ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk. This book is a neuroscientist and trauma researcher's deep dive into how our bodies hold onto fear and stress. It's not just about trauma, it's about understanding why your body reacts the way it does in social settings. Reading this made me realize my ""shyness"" was actually my nervous system protecting me from perceived threats that didn't even exist anymore. Absolute must read if you want to understand the physical roots of social anxiety.

You're performing instead of connecting

Most shy people are secretly perfectionists. We think we need to say something profound, funny, or impressive. Wrong. People don't remember what you say, they remember how you made them FEEL.

What helps: Stop trying to ""win"" conversations. Start asking genuine questions and actually listening. ""What's been taking up most of your headspace lately?"" works way better than rehearsed small talk. When you focus on THEM, the pressure on you dissolves.

The podcast ""The Art of Charm"" completely shifted how I think about social skills. Hosts Jordan Harbinger and AJ Harbinger break down social dynamics and communication in a way that's practical, not preachy. They interview psychologists, FBI negotiators, and charisma experts. One episode on active listening taught me that most ""charismatic"" people just make others feel heard. That's it. That's the secret. Binge worthy if you want to level up your people skills without feeling like a fake.

You're seeking permission to exist

Shy people constantly scan for approval. We wait for someone to invite us into the conversation. We apologize for speaking. We shrink ourselves to make others comfortable. This is exhausting and it keeps you voiceless.

What helps: Practice micro assertions daily. Order your coffee exactly how you want it. Disagree (politely) when someone says something you don't vibe with. Speak ONE sentence louder than feels comfortable. These tiny reps build your ""permission to exist"" muscle.

I also started using Finch, a self care app where you have a little bird companion and complete daily goals. Sounds childish but hear me out. It has daily reflection prompts and helps you track small wins. When I started logging these micro assertions (""spoke up in a meeting,"" ""didn't apologize for my opinion""), I could SEE my progress. That visual feedback loop kept me going when I wanted to retreat back into silence.

Your inner dialogue is BRUTAL

Research shows socially anxious people have an incredibly harsh inner critic. We replay conversations for DAYS, analyzing every awkward pause. We convince ourselves everyone thinks we're weird. This self talk isn't ""truth,"" it's just noise.

What helps: Cognitive defusion techniques from ACT therapy. When you think ""I'm so awkward,"" add ""I'm having the thought that I'm so awkward."" Sounds simple but it creates distance between you and the thought. It's not a fact, it's just mental chatter.

""The Confidence Gap"" by Russ Harris is ridiculously good for this. Harris is an ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) expert and this book teaches you how to act DESPITE fear, not waiting for fear to disappear first. The chapter on defusion changed how I relate to my anxious thoughts. Instead of fighting them or believing them, I learned to just... notice them and move forward anyway. If you struggle with overthinking and self doubt, this book will rewire your brain in the best way.

You haven't found YOUR people

Sometimes you're not shy, you're just in the wrong rooms. When you're around people who share your values and interests, conversation flows naturally. When you're forcing small talk with people you have nothing in common with, yeah, you're gonna feel awkward.

What helps: Join communities around your actual interests. Book clubs, hiking groups, gaming discords, whatever. When you're passionate about the TOPIC, the social anxiety fades into the background. I found my people through a local philosophy meetup and suddenly I wasn't the ""quiet one"" anymore.

Also try Insight Timer, a meditation app with live group sessions and community features. They have tons of guided meditations specifically for social anxiety and building confidence. The teachers are legit, like Tara Brach and Jack Kornfield. I love the ""fear and social anxiety"" series. Listening to these before social events calms my nervous system down and reminds me I'm not alone in this struggle.

For a more structured approach

If you want to go deeper without spending hours reading, there's BeFreed, a personalized learning app that pulls from psychology research, communication experts, and books like the ones above to create custom audio lessons based on your specific goals. A friend who works at Google recommended it to me.

You can tell it something like ""help me become more confident in social settings as an introvert"" and it builds a learning plan just for you, pulling insights from social psychology research and expert interviews. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with examples. I set mine to a calm, conversational voice and listen during my commute. It's been helpful for connecting dots between all these concepts without feeling overwhelming.

Bottom line: You're not broken. You're not defective. Your voice got buried under layers of conditioning, fear, and perfectionism. The work isn't about becoming a different person. It's about peeling back those layers and reconnecting with the voice that was always there.

Start small. One vagal exercise. One micro assertion. One honest conversation. Your voice is waiting for you.",3,1769700774.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

\*\*I've been getting some lovely messages from international ace's.  As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in the UK thank you.\*\*

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 42 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.

1qqbo1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/1qqbo1y/the_artists_way_helped_me_build_internal/,The Artist's Way helped me build internal communication,"A few months before being diagnosed, I read The Artist's Way. It's a creative recovery self-help book for people who want to regain lost creativity, or experience creativity for the first time. Creativity could mean visual art, pottery, writing, playing music, tennis, really any self expression. It's a 12 week program where you read a chapter a week and do journal entries and a few small homework assignments each week. In hindsight, this book massively improved my internal communication. 

The first thing that I think helped were the daily journal entries. You're supposed to journal 3 pages first thing in the morning, just dump your brain onto the page. Write down especially any bad thoughts you might have. It was hard at first, but after a few weeks I ended up needing to develop a color-coding system because so many voices were trying to contribute different ideas to the journal entries. I now know these are my parts. They came out (and I was able to differentiate them) because I was giving them a daily opportunity to speak. 

The second thing I think helped was the ""Artist Date."" The Artist Date is a weekly date you take yourself on. It must be alone, it must be fun, and it must have nothing to do with work or your Artist's Way assignments. In essence, it's a break. It could be going to the movies, a coffee shop, a museum. It could be going to the dollar store and spending as much time as you want browsing stickers, then going home and sticking them on stuff. I had a hard time with my Artist Dates because I kept trying to do things that were ""good for me"" and it felt like an obligation. Eventually I realized, it's not a ""date""... it's a playdate! My Artist Dates needed to be kid-oriented. So I went to the craft store and let myself grab whatever made me excited. I ended up with sparkly pony beads, finger paint, and pearler beads (the kind you lay out in a pixel design and then iron so they fuse together). It was so relaxing and fulfilling just playing. I now know that I was meeting my Littles. 

Finally, it helped me to connect creativity to trauma. Creativity is the human talent for complex problem solving. When we have a problem in front of us that threatens our ability to survive, 100% of our creative abilities are focused on solving that problem, whether we like it or not. In order to be able to use our creative talents for art, we must first escape our stress. That might mean changing our entire lives to get away from abusers, or it might mean therapy and meds to help us reorient to a safe present. Once our brains are free to problem-solve about anything they want, I think traumatized people have enormous capacity for creativity.

I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to build better internal communication. It's really nice to have a roadmap where you just follow directions and wait for results. ",8,1769700634.0,DID,2,1.0,False

I hope that connecting with others is something we can all say is important to do. So please, legitimately, if you love this game: join a discord. I don't care which one, as long as it's AoE4 focused. There's modder discords and tournament discords of varying levels and frequencies. Everything from weekly to monthly. Some do their own ladders, some do fun variant modes, some schedule in person events across the world.

If your IRL community has a local game night, you should try and get involved in that too. Once you go a few times then maybe you can suggest a session of AoE4. Go try and convince your local library/community centre to purchase a copy of AoE2/AoE4 so they can play the campaign missions and educate kids about history. Or even Age of Mythology! I don't care! RTS is the gateway and once you play one there's a higher chance you play another in the same franchise. Maybe not right away, but they'd get re-hooked somewhere down the road.

I'm tired of the AI posts and I want to see people actually *write* their own posts. I want to see them put some thought about the earthy, bean-y aroma of their morning coffee or about how much their commute sucks so they wish they were a medieval knight because traffic didn't exist back then. The world needs more knights, and I mean that in a way of saying we should all build something better together.

So I'm not hiding it, I am genuinely asking you to participate in the next Rising Empires tournament. I am asking you to watch all AoE4 events on twitch and youtube. Please show up, because this community needs you.

Both the ex-wife and the current wife of Frederick Tanzer have also accused him of drugging and raping them.","A former doctor who lied to investigators about sexually assaulting his wife’s best friend in 1989 in her Cincinnati home was sentenced Jan. 28 to 15 years in prison, the maximum possible. In imposing the sentence in federal court in Dayton, U.S. District Judge Michael Newman referred to Frederick Tanzer as a ""serial rapist,"" said his crimes were ""unusually horrendous"" and had caused ""long-lasting pain, both physical and emotional,"" to the victims.

Tanzer, 67, could not be charged with rape, prosecutors said, because the statute of limitations that was in place at the time expired in the mid-1990s. So Tanzer instead was charged with multiple counts of making false statements to federal agents in 2024 when they questioned him about the attack. He lied when he denied having seen or interacted with the woman that day.

But Tanzer’s DNA – taken from a Starbucks coffee cup that he had thrown in the trash – matched DNA found at the woman’s home in 1989. He pleaded guilty last year to three counts of lying to federal agents, and each count was punishable by up to five years in prison. Newman announced the prison term on the second day of a sentencing that began Jan. 12 and included an emotional and detailed statement from the woman Tanzer attacked.

Tanzer, who according to court documents obtained his medical license two months before the 1989 attack, went on to practice medicine for the next three decades in multiple states, including Ohio, Colorado, Kansas and Arizona. He wasn't considered a suspect until 2024. He was arrested in December of that year at his Sycamore Township home.

Tanzer's license to practice internal medicine in Ohio was permanently revoked in March 2025. And as part of his plea agreement, he allowed his medical licenses in other states to expire.

Both Tanzer's now-ex-wife, who is the 1989 victim's best friend, and his current wife have accused him of drugging them before having sex with them. Although Tanzer has not been charged in connection with those allegations, Newman said he considered them in imposing the sentence.

After the sentence was formally imposed, Tanzer told Newman he wanted to say something but his attorney advised him not to speak. His attorney, Christopher Bucio, said Tanzer will appeal the sentence, which also includes a $250,000 fine. Newman said that in the years before Tanzer's arrest, he was making $400,000 a year.

The first attack investigators connected to Tanzer was the one in 1989. The woman, who was 29 at the time, was attacked in her Columbia Tusculum home by a man wearing a black, full-body spandex suit, black gloves and a mask that covered his face. The only thing he said was, “Shh,” before putting a knife to her throat. He sexually assaulted her over five and a half hours. Had Tanzer spoken, she would have recognized him.

In court on Jan. 12, the woman, now 66, described existing in a chronic state of anxiety. She said she has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic insomnia, night terrors and panic attacks. She has been in therapy for decades. “I have felt imprisoned most of my adult life,"" she said. In a statement released after the sentence was imposed, U.S. Attorney Dominick Gerace II said Tanzer ""poses a grave risk to the public and deserves to be in prison not only for his lies, but also for the despicable attack he was trying to cover up.”",18,1769700451.0,TwoXChromosomes,1,1.0,False

Sam here. I recently sculpted this **event-exclusive miniature for Ardacon 2026**, and thought it might be of interest here. The sculpt itself is exclusive to the event, but the **elf aesthetic and armour style** is something I’m considering exploring further.

I’d really appreciate some feedback from the community:

* Does the style read as “Middle-earth adjacent” to you?
* Anything you’d change or push further in the design?
* If expanded, would you prefer characters, warriors, or something else?

I’m genuinely interested in where people think this kind of look sits stylistically, as any future work in this vein would be shaped heavily by feedback.

For transparency, I’ve also just set up a Patreon where I’ll be sharing previews, WIPs, and polling followers on what to sculpt next (it’s free to follow, with an optional £3 buy-me-a-coffee tier):

Had my first dose of Tirzepatide on Sunday. I was a little scared to press the button, and I jerked a little bit when I finally did. I had a lot of liquid oozing down my leg when I completed the dose. I was super afraid that I lost the entire dose and even called the pharmacy to see if there was something I could do! Obviously there wasn’t.

Going on day four, I can tell you I definitely got most of it in- definitely not all but most of it. I’m rarely hungry and when I am that goes away very quickly. I don’t feel full, but I’m no longer hungry and I don’t have the craving to continue to eat. So unless it’s mind over matter because I know I did the injection on Sunday, I would say it’s definitely working.

When I do eat, I try to eat healthy. For example, yesterday for lunch I had one English cucumber mixed with one avocado, a little bit of feta cheese and pumpkin seeds. That was all I had all day until I got home from my evening activity and had carrots and hummus. I wasn’t hungry, but I felt like I should have something because I don’t want to get into the habit of not eating. I didn’t realize that I was going to feel like that so it’s a new sensation for me to think about eating when I don’t want to eat versus not wanting to eat when all I did was think about eating. I’m losing weight every single day so I’m going to be very interested to see what the results will be at the end of the month. 

Lots of water and I use liquid IV for electrolytes, and I’m going to start putting collagen in my coffee. Today for lunch I’m having one and a half hamburger patties (no bun) with a blue cheese dressing sauce and I know that’s going to satisfy me until I get home. If I get hungry tonight, I will have carrots and hummus again. If I’m not hungry, I will probably still have a few carrots with hummus for reasons I already explained.

We’ll see what happens on Saturday because I’m going out to eat and I usually have a couple of drinks. I think I’ll be fine because I’ll be on day six and I suspect the effect will start wearing off a little bit given the fact that I don’t feel like I got the entire injection.

1qqb6d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLABprep/comments/1qqb6d4/my_plab_journey_honest_advice_for_plab_1_2/,My PLAB Journey – Honest Advice for PLAB 1 & 2,"Hey everyone,

I recently cleared PLAB 2 and wanted to share my experience because I remember being completely clueless at the start and getting a lot of advice that didn’t make sense.

For context: I passed PLAB 1 with a score of 155 and PLAB 2 (16/16 stations). While these scores are above average, this post isn’t about “do exactly what I did.” I’m just sharing what worked for me and what I think could help you. There’s an element of luck to it all so stay open minded. 

PLAB 1 – Timeline & Preparation

\* Prep usually takes \~3 months (more or less depending on your baseline).

\* Resource: Plabable – enough on its own. By exam day, I was answering questions almost out of instinct.

How I used it effectively:

1. Get the Gems (officially if possible – they’re updated and follow latest guidelines)

2. Study one topic at a time (e.g., cardiology)

\* Read all Gems

\* Google/YouTube/ChatGPT anything unfamiliar (for context, not memorisation)

\* Do 60–70% of questions

3. While doing questions:

\* Understand why wrong options are wrong

\* Go through revision notes thoroughly

4. After all topics:

\* Do one full read of all Gems

\* Randomly complete the remaining 30–40% of questions

Timeline: Finish 7–10 days before the exam

Mocks:

\* 2 days of free mocks – mainly to refresh memory

\* 3 paid mocks over 7 days under exam conditions:

\* One mock every two days

\* Half a day to sit

\* \~1.5 days to review gaps

Takeaway: PLAB 1 is very doable. Don’t over-stress or burn yourself out right before the exam. It’s only every 3–4 months, so failing is inconvenient but manageable with smart prep.

Some may feel this method is excessive, but  to maximise your pass rate I feel like its necessary.

PLAB 2 – Preparation & Strategy

PLAB 2 is trickier, especially for IMGs, but everything is coachable. With enough practice, you’ll get it.

Key challenge:

\* What to practice

\* Who to practice with

\* How to know if you’re doing it right

Solution: Have a template & benchmark – know what’s right, wrong, and how to approach each scenario. Different stations require different approaches.

Academies – Are they worth it?

Do I recommend joining one? ✅ Yes

Do you need one to pass? ❌ No

Cons:

1. Cost – £200–£600 depending on the package

2. Rigidity – templates can make you sound scripted

3. Material – much is publicly available

Why I still recommend joining:

\* Cost: £300–£400 extra is nothing compared to failing (\~£3,000 total exam cost)

\* Rigidity: Communication skills are your responsibility; templates don’t replace them

\* Material: Not the reason you join

Real benefits:

1. Structure – keeps you on track. When you’re busy with work, kids, just life in general its easy to fall out of the schedule.

2. Community – motivates and saves time, as having people that are studying the same thing at the same time under the same template makes everything more streamlined.

3. Feedback – most valuable; knowing mistakes and improving

My experience with ARS Medica:

\* Led by Dr Radwan, who is heavily invested in student success. Honestly he was a mentor, a friend and a supporter all at the same time and I really appreciate everything he did.

\* Practice sessions 3–4 days/week

\* Live lectures WITH active practice

\* Student material bank – designed for timed practice, not reading. IT IS AN ABSOLUTE GEM. If you join the academy please please make the best of it. 

Drawbacks:

\* Small team → occasional session cancellations

\* No physical academy (affiliated with another I wouldn’t recommend)

Even so, Dr Radwan, the materials, and feedback are excellent. So definitely consider the online course. They have free sessions every week, join one and test the waters yourself. 

Exam prep advice

\* Don’t neglect any of the three domains

\* Timing can feel brutal at first, but with practice you’ll often finish early

\* In combined stations, reserve \~2 minutes for physical exams and focus on key signs

\* Go in relaxed and energized – its absolutely crucial that you go in with loads of energy and no stress, whatever works for you and gets you there for those 3 hours DO IT ( enough sleep, coffee, beta blockers, prayer… anything) 

Key points:

You won’t have time to think. Practice autopilot responses:

\* Don’t memorize

\* Focus on weak areas

\* Practice full timed management out loud repeatedly rather than reading them of a prompt or a card 

\* For example: There’s a platform called Gk notes. As a revision for the managements its really good but to practice on, understand approaches and communication skills it was absolutely useless. So I wouldn’t use for anything but a quick managements guide.

Memorisation does work: In prescriptions. 

Also don’t worry much about examiners. Most of them are nice and even the ones having a bad day are fair, completely ignore them. Some are more generous and holistic than others but it evens out at the end of the day so just focus on yourself and patient in front of you 

Final Thoughts

\* Good luck! You can do it.

\* NB: Whether or not you should sit these exams considering the recent emergency bill is an entirely different question. Please don’t discourage anyone here. This post is for people who do want to sit the exam and feel lost— they don’t need the negative energy.

Morgan knew how to choose date spots that were comfortable for him. His neighborhood, called Heather Hills (supposedly used to be a flower farm or whatever they’re called), was filled with row homes and little one-story craftsman houses. Streets were tree-lined, the sidewalks were brick rather than concrete, and the yards were tiny. I loved it. It had the vibe of an early-century thriving place. The suburban feel is broken by small neighborhood businesses every other block or so. There’s a camera store that anchors Morgan’s building, and a little ice cream shop across the street. Two blocks was a boutique grocery store that specialized in local, organic products and proudly proclaimed their partnerships with a new craft soapery opening up out in the actual suburbs.

Every Saturday, we would have our “date days,” which started that first day a month ago. Meet up somewhere in the morning, have breakfast, coffee, then just go walk around. Last week we’d gone over to Main Street in St. Francis. I thought it would be the first time we’d be in a place where he didn’t know anyone. I was mistaken. He’d lived there for a decade before moving into Heather Hills. Everywhere we went, someone greeted him. I wanted to be annoyed. It grated. But there was something about his easy way with people that calmed me. It didn’t hurt that I picked up four new clients.

This week, I wanted to take him somewhere I knew he wasn’t familiar with. Serena’s was a bakery I loved.  I even stopped in the day before to make sure no one knew him, just to be sure. Serena, the owner, was someone I’d known since she worked at the Cracked Egg Bistro downtown. She’d been one of my favorite servers there. I’d invested in her bakery immediately when she told me she was opening one.

It was in a different part of the city from where Morgan lived, closer to my condo out on Griffton in the Marquette Gardens neighborhood. The little bakery, just three tables inside and two on the sidewalk outside, sat across from a little park that functions more as a square. It was surrounded by houses I called Victorian, three-story homes, each a different color, of course, with the kind of character that reminded me of a Sherlock Holmes novel. I usually came on Sundays, after my jog, to grab a pastry, a coffee, and a mimosa. Serena would just get to see me twice this weekend.

I didn’t like how the day started. Dark gray clouds were rolling in from the east, over the river. They threatened a thunderstorm. The weather that morning cautioned that tornadoes were possible. There hadn’t been a tornado in this part of the metro area in over a hundred years. If it bleeds, it leads, and all that.

Morgan was bouncing on the balls of his feet in his sandals on the sidewalk as I walked up. He’d put on a minty-colored button-up today and khaki shorts, with a black cap backwards on his head. The buttons of the shirt strained against his chest, little hairs poking out. His beard was glistening, and when I kissed his cheek, I smelled the apricot balm I’d bought for him last week. For once, I felt neither over- nor underdressed with him. I’d put on some slate grey shorts, a bright green button-up. My toes wiggled in my own sandals.

“Hey, babe.” His voice was breathless in my ear. “How do I look?”

I stepped back to look him up and down, and made him spin around. “Acceptable.”

He barked a laugh even as he pouted. “I’m hurt, babe. I actually tried today!”

I bent down, nibbled his ear, and whispered, “You’re gonna look even better when those clothes are on my floor, you fuckable man.”

That elicited a pleasured whine from him. I rubbed my cheek in his beard and then grinned at him. His hand was in mine in an instant as we crossed the threshold, a bell tinkling above us.

“Aaron! How are you? Usual?” Serena was always cheery. She’d dyed her again, a neon blue that complemented the yellow contact lenses she wore. “Oh! This must be Morgan! Aaron talks about you constantly.”

Morgan smiled, but it was strained. One of his feet was bouncing lightly on the floor. “Um… Hi. Yeah. How are you?”

I squeezed his, and he squeezed back. I eyed him quizzically. He shook his head, and I shrugged. Okay then.

“Make it a double on my usual, no mimosas today. To go, please?” Serena got busy packing up my order—two ham and cheese croissants and heavily sugared café au laits—while Morgan was busy inspecting things. He had a nervous energy I’d never seen before. One hand rubbed his arm or the back of his neck, while that foot kept bouncing. Maybe the familiarity of the places he’d been taking me to was a mask for something deeper. I would ask, but across the street, in the park.

“Here you go, love,” Serena said, jostling me from my planning. She handed me a brown paper bag and the coffees. The smells from the bag made my stomach rumble. “On me today. He’s cute, almost like a puppy. If you keep him, make sure he’s house-trained.”

Morgan wrapped his arm around my waist and took one of the cups as we exited. I told him I wanted to go sit in the park and eat. He nodded, still a little quiet, but his energy was better out here. We crossed the cobblestone street, passed through the wrought iron gate, and found a bench by the old fountain. It was one of those that had been built when the neighborhood was new. There was a scene of two boys and a lion carved in marble. The spears the boys held towards the lion spouted water into the pool below. Someone must have cleaned it recently, as the smell of bleach was heavy in the air.

Our knees kept in contact while we ate. Morgan was either mesmerized by the fountain or deep in thought. I couldn’t decide which. My hand found his knee and squeezed it. He smiled at me, crumbs decorating his beard. I brushed them away. He kissed my palm, the beard sending tingles through me.

“I’m sorry,” he said softly afterwards. He was looking at the fountain again, carefully avoiding my gaze. “I ruined this.”

I scooted closer, wrapped my arm around his shoulder, and lay my head on the top of his. “Not really. I should have guessed.”

“No. I should have told. I don’t… I like places I know. They’re easy? I think. But new people, new places? I get… I don’t even know how to describe it.”

I rubbed my hand absentmindedly on his shoulder. “It was weird seeing you so nervous.”

“Yeah… It’s weird to *feel* that nervous. But I’m glad we did this. Serena seems nice, and that croissant was amazing.”

I smiled into his hat. I breathed it in. “Did you put that beard balm in your hair too?”

His barking laugh came back. Good. “I did. It smelled so good. Why not, you know?”

My hand pushed his face toward me, and I kissed him. He shrugged into the kiss, mewling. The noises he made… All the time. Sexy. I’d never had a man become so pliable in my hands before. Hadn’t really been the dominant one in a relationship, honestly. Hadley had destroyed my confidence.

Hadley. We still hadn’t had the conversation that I desperately wanted and needed to have with Morgan. About who Hadley was, what he’d done. He was constantly deflecting with a joke, or an acquaintance would interrupt us. I had fallen in love with this man, wanted to ask him to move in together, but that… that was becoming the Grand Canyon in this relationship.

We broke the kiss, and Morgan lay his head on my shoulder. His hand slipped to my shorts, fumbling with the button. “Nope,” I told him, twining my fingers into his. “Kids come here.”

As if summoned by words, a young family traipsed by. Three brown-haired kids were zooming circles around their parents, who were smiling at each other. “Hi there!” they said in unison. We waved hello and assured the little boy that yes, we were comfortable sitting like this on the bench. They zoomed away to the swing set on the other side of the fountain, and we were left alone again.

Thunder rumbled in the distance. I looked up to see that the clouds had rolled over us. Wind picked up, sending leaves into the fountain. The paper bag our croissants had been packed in rolled away. Morgan ran after it, slipping on the grass and losing a sandal in the process. He got the bag, tossed it in a trashcan, and put his sandal back on. We were laughing as we left the park.

“Where to? Your place? It’s right around the corner, right?”

“Not yet. We’ve been avoiding a conversation.”

Morgan tensed. Sighed. Withdrew his arm from around my waist. “I know… Does it have to be today?”

A sprinkle of rain fell from the sky. “Does it have to be today? No. It doesn’t have to be any day, if we end this right now.”

Morgan stared at me wide-eyed, a pained expression on his face. His beard quivered. Tears were forming. My heart broke, but I had to hold this line. Hadley was the chasm between us. I don’t know why it was so important to me that Morgan understood what that bastard had done to. I just knew that he needed to know.

“No, not that. I don’t want that. I love you, Aaron.”

Fuck. He had to say it. Right now, of all times. We’d studiously avoided that for a month. The sprinkle became a shower. Lightning cracked overhead. I sighed.

“There’s a bookshop half a block down. I have an order to pick up. Let’s get out of this rain.”

Morgan looked grateful (and ridiculously hot in rain-drenched clothing). We made it inside the shop, called the Garden Bookery, just as the shower became a downpour. The lights inside flickered a couple of times, causing a little girl somewhere to scream. Poor thing.

“I’m gonna browse, see if I can find something on stitching techniques,” Morgan told me. I nodded. The woman behind the counter, an older lady with graying hair and piercing violet eyes, smiled at me. Said her name was Lizzie. Asked me if I needed anything. I gave her my name, saying that I had a book that I’d ordered. It was the latest from RF Kuang, *Katabasis*. The talk around it was interesting. Too academic, too stilted. Perfect for me, then. Dark academia was a genre I loved, and I’d become obsessed with Kuang’s writing after tearing through the *Poppy War Trilogy* last year while on vacation in Arizona.

Thunder cracked again, loud, as if lightning had struck the street outside the shop. The lights flickered, fell dark for thirty seconds or so, and came back on. Lizzie apologized for the inconvenience, but she’d need to wait until the computer reset to take payment. I didn’t mind. It didn’t seem like the rain was letting up anytime soon, so I had the patience of a saint.

I wondered where Morgan had gotten off to. It wasn’t a large store, but it did have a second floor. I heard the creaking of the building as people shuffled above on the floor, and the squeaking of stairs as someone came down.

“Aaron!” Morgan called. “I met this guy upstairs. He was reading through that book you really liked, *Poppy War*. I told him you two should talk!”

I turned and felt like I’d been punched. Descending the stairs behind Morgan was a man I knew too well. I felt the phantom pains from his abuse on my skin, heard his voice whispering darkly in my head. Fuck. He had that same arrogant, pale face, and his black eyes narrowed as he saw me.

“Aaron,” he hissed violently. My skin crawled from the way he said it. Morgan looked back at him in confusion. Then at me. Something must have clicked for him because he looked panicked.

1qqb4oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancunTravelGuide/comments/1qqb4oy/paradisus_playa_del_carmen_review_december_2025/,Paradisus Playa Del Carmen Review - December 2025,"This is my review of Paradisus Playa Del Carmen. I decided on Paradisus after considering Iberostar Paraiso Maya and Finest PM as well. I am very happy with my choice and believe we will go back to Paradisus at some point in the next few years.

My wife and I (both 37) stayed in early December with our 4.5 year old son. We stayed in a Master Suite Nature View with family concierge. Overall, I think Paradisus (**specifically with family concierge**) is an ideal choice for families with young children who are seeking the following:

1. more focused on pools than the beach 
2. Relative luxury for the price point
3. solid to good food
4. Great service
5. Plenty of entertainment and options for younger children

Paradisus is probably not for you if you need a pristine beach experience, amazing food, *true* luxury, or have older children.  Happy to answer more specific questions in comments.

————————————————

**Transit + Checkin**

It is about a 45 minute drive from Cancun airport. We used ""Cancun Shuttle"" which was much cheaper than many other options I saw listed but perfectly adequate. Newer vehicle and a friendly driver. 

Resort check-in was smooth, especially with the dedicated family concierge section. Of course, they stored our luggage and we were able to use the resort before our room was ready. 

**Room**

We opted for the Master Suite Nature View because we wanted a separate room from our son and were not interested in a swim up. He slept on a pull out couch which he was very happy with. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep on it (both due to curvature of the mattress and significant staining) and for older children, it may be wise to opt for one of their rollaway beds. 

The room is enormous, as expected. 2 distinct bathroom areas (one with shower and toilet…the other with a jacuzzi tub) and a large balcony. I personally was not a fan of the bed but I’m sure others will love it. I am very used to the types of smooth mattresses that come through the mail (Casper, Tuft & Needle, etc), and the mattress in the room was a spring mattress. It had the classic bumps that I had to adjust to. Bed was quite firm…I found the pillows to be a bit sub par (either too soft or prone to lumping stuffing). 

There is some cosmetic wear and tear in the room (expected with a family resort). Chipped paint, scratches on the dining room table, a discoloration on the couch here or there...nothing deal breaking though.  Some other annoyances were that our balcony door from our bedroom did not open and the shower door didn’t stay closed. We did not contact reception regarding these issues because we spent very little time in the room.

We enjoyed the twice a day sprucing up of the room (a family concierge perk) and consistently stocked mini bar + snacks. 

Ultimately, the room served the purpose we needed it to. It was a well temperatured and comfortable place to sleep. We knew we were not going to spend time in the room aside from sleeping because there is so much to enjoy outside of it. This is why we never complained about the issues I mentioned above.  

**Pools**

There are pools everywhere. The swim up pool snakes around the property with main pools interspersed within.  By my count, there are 4 main pool areas (aside from the swim up snake). 

1. Main Pool…largest and has a volleyball net set up 
2. Pirate Ship Pool…with a climbable pirate ship equipped with 2 small slides
3. Aquazone Waterpark…right outside the central area of the resort. Has 5 water slides and other water play sections
4. Family Concierge Pool

This is one of the resort aspects where the family concierge difference really shines. All the pool areas are certainly nice, but the family concierge pool significantly nicer. It has the luxury atmosphere and service that we were seeking. The atmosphere was way calmer than all other pool areas due to less people being there and the pool being surrounded by the beautiful mangroves which help to filter sound. It felt like a quiet oasis compared to the main resort areas. The main pools are surrounded by buildings which leads to a noisier experience. The swim up bar is well staffed and well stocked, with premium liquor (I believe). The pool itself might be the largest on the property with plenty of in water loungers. The chair battle in the main pool areas seemed more intense as well. There was plenty of lounge seating for the number of family concierge guests who were using the FC pool. Other cool benefits include a distinct food menu and free sunscreen/after sun gel (perfect to lather on and not worry about exhausting your personal stash). 

We spent 90+ % of our pool time at the family concierge pool. It was a highlight of our stay. 

**Beach**

If you are steadfast on an amazing beach experience, this resort probably isn’t for you. The beach is a 3-7 minute walk depending on where your room is and the beach is not visible from the resort. You pass through the mangroves to get there. Once at the beach, the sand is very nice (soft and fine) but the water is murky. There are some large rock formations near the shoreline beneath the water. And there was some sargassum, but only a little. It was great having family concierge here as well with a private area with plenty of loungers and Bali beds. The smoothie bar at this beach is also great with the best non-alcoholic drinks at the resort.

**Nature and Wildlife**

The resort is built within the mangrove forest. This creates a beautiful atmosphere - tons of greenery, scenic strolls, and natural shade. Being in such a natural environment means that some furry friends call the resort home. You will see some cats and A LOT of coatis. They are intelligent and resourceful creatures and WILL steal food/drink that you leave unattended. They will go through your bag and find food you left in there. My son loved them and they were never aggressive to truly bother us. 

The main area of the resort with all the restaurants is built with an interconnected Koi pond. My son loved feeding the fish (ask for fish food from your family concierge) but was also excited about the turtles and egrets that would wade in the water, seeking smaller fish to eat. Between the cats, coatis, and deliberate wildlife placements, this ended up being a massive benefit to us with our son’s endless fascination with animals. 

**Kids**

There was no shortage of entertainment for my son. The beach, pools/slides, and animals would have been enough…but the resort does a good job of keeping the little ones entertained. Every day at certain times,  there is something exciting going on in the main area of the resort such as costumed employees, face painting, and dance parties.  One night, they set up bounce houses in a big conference room area. We didn’t attend any of the formal evening programming, but every night had multiple featured activities such as theater shows, movies, and interactive performances.

My son went to the kid’s club (Kidsdom) 3 times and really enjoyed it. The staff was friendly and we never were concerned leaving him there. Three downsides of the kids club are 1) the twice daily closures, 2) limited space, and 3) the fact they don’t feed the children. The club is open from 9am-11pm but it closed from 2-3 and 5-6. This ends up causing a frantic lineup around 5:45 PM where parents who have booked dinner reservations in the adults only section are desperate to ensure their kid gets one of the kids club spots. This is more acute if your child is under 4 years old - I heard they accept a maximum of 4 “babies” at one time. 

If you want your child in the kids club at night, the strategy boils down to:

1. feed them before 5:45 (challenging because there are no restaurants open from 5-6). The best option is ordering room service around 4:30.
2. Lineup at 5:45 (or earlier) 
3. Cross your fingers 

None of this posed a significant issue for us…but if you plan on being free of your children for adult time every night, expect some challenges. 

**Food/Drink**

The food ranges from solid to very good. Very rarely were we blown away by any dishes…but this was expected at an AI at this price point. If you want to be blown away by food at a family resort, you probably have to spend 2X and book Grand Velas. I’ll break down each food establishment we indulged in based on category:

*Breakfast/Lunch*

Grouping these together because they are collectively an aspect where family concierge is really worth it. It gives you access to the Lunch Box restaurant, which has a substantially more refined menu and presentation than the main buffet (which is the only other breakfast option) or the Celsius restaurant by the main pool. We did the buffet for breakfast once and were underwhelmed by the quality, despite the immense variety. Lunch box was consistently excellent. They have a small buffet stand if your kids can’t wait for the a la carte items…but otherwise, all food is prepared to order. For lunch, I was particularly impressed by their catch of the day which was as fresh, tasty, and well presented, better than some fish items at the dinner restaurants. 

*Dinner*

Family concierge was great here as well because I never worried about reservations. I made most of them in the days leading up to our vacation. Our concierge also handled any adjustments we needed to make while on vacation.  

Bana Teppanyaki: great show for the kids but food was just ok 

Cielo: “fine dining” Mexican food but I found the flavors to be a bit muted. Granted, I lived in Mexico City for 2 years so my expectations for aguachile, birria, etc may be a bit high. 

Sal Steak Cave: Included with Family Concierge and probably our best dining experience. Food was **beautifully** presented and very tasty, except for my NY Strip steak which was only average. It was quite thin and didn't have the appropriate crust to reflect an atmosphere of that level. I was most impressed with their desserts (soufflé and cheesecake specifically) which were probably the 2 best things we ate all trip. 

Flora: Healthier options but still presented wonderfully and one of the tastier meals we had. Only flaw was their poached pear dessert...which was not close to right. It was more like a raw pear dipped in wine, without the poaching.  

Blue agave: Worst meal we had. I found the tacos to be average but again, my time in Mexico City likely warped my views here. Most of the meats were dry and the queso app was not good.

*Snacks*

The ice cream place in the main area is AMAZING.  It is more of a gelato style and all the flavors were delicious. We appreciated the candy, cookies, and other treats spread out through the resort. 

*Coffee*

They have an exclusive deal with nespresso so all coffee based drinks are made with nespresso pods. This was disappointing to me but if you are a nespresso fan, you will be happy. I would have enjoyed a more traditional coffee experience with fresh ground beans. 

*Alcohol*

I enjoyed many different types/styles of margaritas and most bartenders are happy to make recommendations or adjust things for you. The mixed drinks tend to be on the weaker side. My son loved going to the swim up bar at the FC pool and ordering fruit shakes.

**Cenote**

Awesome experience - again, family concierge showing its worth by having this included. The journey is a 30 minute bus ride and you get to enjoy 2 very distinct cenotes. One is a cave that you swim through and the other is more jungly and open air, with cliff jumping and zip lining. Overall, a beautiful diversion into nature that I would highly recommend as a change of pace from the resort. 

**Spa**

Another area where family concierge shines. There is a \~1 hour water ritual included, which is effectively usage of the sauna, steam room, and private pools/jacuzzis. My wife and I greatly enjoyed this small adults only reprieve while our son was in the kids club. Was easy to schedule through our concierge. The spa itself is very nice and well serviced. 

**Our Concierge**

We had Jonathan as our concierge and he was excellent. He was very experienced, mentioning that he has been doing this for over 5 years. He went out of his way to chat with us when passing by at the resort and was very receptive to our requests via Whatsapp.",1,1769699452.0,CancunTravelGuide,0,1.0,False
1qqb4ko,https://v.redd.it/n39cgzox0bgg1,Solution for Sweating Under Tin Roof Covered Porch,"This is a tin roof covering my back porch. Back porch is wood in structure. I’ve had no rain, but it’s been pretty cold lately. If you walk out onto my porch in the mornings you would think it rained and leaked all through the roof though. Lots of water. I just realized this morning (just bought this house) that it’s coming from the condensation dripping under the tin roof. The porch deck boards do have some slight sagging in the center (not even sure it’s related to the condensation) but other than that potentially being caused by the condensation I don’t really see any huge problems coming from this sweating. But if there are some potential short or long term issues I’d love the insight. But really on a nice morning if I want to sit out there and drink coffee I’d prefer to not have water dripping on my head. That, and the decking becomes a slipping hazard when wet.

So I guess what I’m looking for from your insight is:

1) Are there some larger issues I need to be considering? If so, on a 1 to 10 scale how would you rate it in terms of how much you would give a shit if it were your house. 

2) If you did want to prevent the sweating or maybe prevent the sweating from covering the deck boards, are there any solutions where the time and money/effort will actually be worth the outcome? ",1,1769699445.0,Roofing,2,1.0,False

# Upcoming changes 🔮

Major changes are still coming to CWA including:

* A brand new Svelte based Frontend.

* A new web reader, epub.js is a little dated now and there are now much better alternatives
* A much more robust & powerful progress syncing system that will be able to have CWA act as a single source of truth for reading progress no matter what device you read from
* Full Text Search functionality
* 🐁 is coming very soon, the integration just had to be as sensible & respectful to the 🐁 and it's servers as possible and a good balance has now been reached

**A massive thank you to the 60+ contributors who helped test, translate, and code this release.**

I'm Andy! A 23-year-old sports enthusiast from Austria 🇦🇹 with a passion for football ⚽️ & a sucker for coffee ☕️

Describing myself feels a bit weird & awkward since I don't want to come across like a fake sell-out, but I would say I'm someone who is passionate about what I love, paired with a pretty driven attitude, while also being naturally curious about life with its little side-quests & a bit nerdy 🤓 (or in the words of my friends, simply autistic) Even though I enjoy being in the presence of people, at least most of the time when my social battery is charged (even when I have my resting bitch face on 😑) I still tend to be more shy & reserved at first, but once I have warmed up I can absolutely turn into a bubbly person or a bit of a goofball (aka kasperl 🥸) over time

I can speak English 🇬🇧 & obviously my mother tongue German 🇩🇪 fluently (except for the more or less funny Austrian dialect part) as well as some Dutch 🇳🇱 & Russian 🇷🇺 although my speaking skills are only enough to get me into trouble & not out of it to be honest. With that being said I'm still fairly solid at understanding both, especially Russian (as long as I don't have to read it)

🆓 *Me in my free tim*e:

When I'm not active due to work, I still like to stay active in various forms by playing any kind of (ball) sport, going to the gym 🏋🏻 or doing some running 🏃🏻 & biking 🚴🏻 for example. I also enjoy some seasonal activities from time to time, like hiking 🥾 in summer ☀️ or sledding 🛷 in winter ❄️

At home I love spending my time pursuing my passion for football further, diving deeper into some of my interests like computer science & psychology, or just playing some video games 🎮 (especially with my friends)

👀 *What am I looking for on her*e?

Well ideally I would love to find someone who is emotionally available for a deep & meaningful hopefully everlasting romantic relationship, but I also know you can't magically force chemistry between two random & potentially completely different human beings. So if things don't work out romantically in the first place, I'm still open to making some friends along the way

As someone who would find himself somewhere on the ace spectrum, I find the label demi (demisexual & potentially somewhat demiromantic) the closest to describing me (although I'm not a fan of labels at all in general) Maybe it could also just be that I tend to be a slow-burn when it comes to forming a genuine connection. Only one way to find out I guess 🙂",1,1769699233.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

I own a coffee shop in the boca raton area and I’m exploring a potential second location in Oakland Park, in the space next to Tripping Animals taproom. Before I go too far, I want honest feedback from people who actually know the neighborhood.

My main questions/concerns:

* **Foot traffic:** Does that area get enough daytime walk-in traffic, or is it mostly destination-only?
* **Parking:** Is parking generally a headache there? Does it turn people off from quick coffee stops?
* **Demand fit:** Would a “third place” style coffee shop do well there? (Good espresso + matcha, house-made syrups, cozy vibe, laptop-friendly seating, occasional events at night.)

A few things that would help me a ton:

* If you live/work nearby: do you already have a go-to coffee spot? What’s missing?
* What times does the area feel busiest (weekday mornings, weekends, nights)?
* Any red flags about that exact pocket of Oakland Park?
* If you’ve been to Tripping Animals: do you think a coffee concept next door makes sense, or would it feel mismatched?

Not trying to self-promote, I genuinely doing homework before committing to anything. Appreciate any insight.",6,1769699120.0,fortlauderdale,9,0.8,False
1qqazdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1qqazdo/opinion_on_my_nonsmoking_coffee_shop_ال3_شجرات/,Opinion on my non-smoking Coffee Shop ال3 شجرات,"So I had posted a couple of weeks ago a thread whether it's a good idea to have a fully (inside) non-smoking coffee shop in Tunisia.

I have made some decisions and some progress.

**Name:**   
I usually don't like names that have nothing to do with the reality of the local people where the business is going to be. I don't like names in latin languages, people don't even understand them: ""Sips and dips"",""Agui"", ""Eric Kaiser"" ... ""Barista"" is okaish. I also don't like names related to my person.  
So, since there are three nice trees in front of the local and since the street where the coffee shop will be located is called ""Boulevar de l'environnement"", and since trees are a constant in our lives, I decided to call it ""Three Trees"". 

[ثلاثة شجرات](https://preview.redd.it/ery3mln9wagg1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea464a5bddeeb9261f9d1911914cf3f1d5f8c387)

 and since the street where the coffee shop will be located is called ""Boulevar de l'environnement"", and since trees are a constant in our lives, I decided to call it ""Three Trees"". And I made a logo (manual. no AI):

I decided to go for rail LEDs for the lighting. I think one of the bad things about coffee shops in Tunisia is the light, they all go for little windows right up of the walls, that serve for ventilation and for lighting, but I find them most of times ugly and depressive, so I will not make windows. The good thing about rail LEDs is the flexibility, so I can adjust them freely.

I also finished making the ""Fayence"" for the kitchen, and for behind the counter. It would look like close to this (a 3D render I did with Blender):

For the counter, I will make short ones with a large surface (again, I don't like how in Tunisia they make the counter very high and narrow)

For the chairs, I will go for on big bank on the big wall, with small separate joinable tables, 2 normal tables in the middle, and one L-shaped bank on the left side of the door, and two long tabourets on the right side of the door.

Two years ago I had a close family friend pass away. I haven’t recently given much thought to her, nor have I spoken about her etc…

I dreamt that she was sitting at a bench in a busy shopping centre (she spent a lot of time at shopping centers when she was alive) and she was looking at her son in law (who is alive and well) who was a little far away, drinking a coffee. There was no other person familiar to me in the dream except them two. He didn’t see her, as he was busy talking to someone but she was just watching him from a distance. I do not have much to do with him at all in my waking life.

She then turned and looked at me, and smiled very widely. Initially I admired seeing her and felt safe and peaceful, but eventually it became scary to me as her smile widened and her head tilted forward, and her teeth were all separated and she became ‘scary looking’. I quickly left and kept walking after that.

This is not what she was like when she was alive, as she was a very beautiful older lady with pure intentions. 

Could someone please help me interpret this a little more? Thank you in advance.",1,1769699022.0,DreamsInterpretation,1,1.0,False

\*\*u/CockroachBoth6713 (18F) & tanhai\_bhai (19M)\*\*  

She specifically wants 18+, so the 19-year-old works great. Both are super into music—she plays piano, sings, does art and sports; he plays guitar, loves movies, anime, walking. They’re on the same page about loyalty and honesty, hate ghosting, and want someone who actually talks things out. Chatty when they’re comfortable, okay with public affection, and both like equal decisions with some closeness. Picture them swapping playlists, bingeing anime, going on late walks just talking—feels mature, chill, and real.

\*\*JarsorDirt (17F) & u/Western\_Main\_7329 (16M)\*\*  

Solid 16–17 match for two introverted creative types. She’s into reading, writing, baking, photography, and rewatches Brooklyn 99 when stressed. He plays guitar, writes poetry, sings, and is deep into Daredevil/superhero stuff. Both take time opening up but really value caring, understanding, mature people. They’re shy about affection but chatty once comfy, and both like balanced space. Imagine quiet nights trading poems, him playing guitar while she bakes, or just geeking out over shows—slow, artsy, and sweet.

\*\*No-Ostrich-6208 (16F) & Embarrased\_Builder (17M)\*\*  

She’s open up to 19, so 17 is perfect. Both creative—she makes jewelry, paints, listens to music, loves Vampire Diaries drama. He’s into history, computers, art, music, and cute/funny anime. They both need regular reassurance (“I like you” texts hit different), prefer equal decisions, and are careful about who they trust. Chatty when they click. Late-night anime sessions, sharing art, emotional check-ins that actually feel safe—this one has vulnerable-but-exciting energy.

\*\*baddie\_boy\_69 (17F, seeking Female) & u/Loose\_Song9382 (17 Bi-gender, mainly female-leaning)\*\*  

Nice queer match at 17. Both play Minecraft/Roblox, both super creative—she’s theater, singing, improv, reading, writing, obsessed with The Penguin’s messy characters. They need frequent check-ins to feel secure, love hugs/public affection, talk a ton when comfy, and want equal say in things. Dramatic and artistic vibes line up perfectly—shared performances, deep character analysis, cozy gaming nights. Passionate, supportive, and full of chaotic creative fun.

\*\*Extension\_Sky6140 (18F) & -asimpleboy (18M)\*\*  

Exact same age, very calm energy. She’s movies, cooking, learning random stuff, loves Modern Family for the laughs. He’s movies, reading, tennis, and Game of Thrones world-building. Both show care through actions more than words, like their own space but still chat when they’re comfortable. They want respectful, understanding, non-judgy partners who can just talk nicely. Coffee/tea dates, cooking together, debating plot twists—low-key, thoughtful, grows slowly into something solid.

\*\*up\_ur\_ass\_and\_around\_the\_corner (13M, seeking Male) & Guilty-Breakfast5164 (14M, seeking Everyone)\*\*  

Young gay match, ages super close. Both heavy into Minecraft/Roblox—perfect for building worlds together. One likes taking charge, the other’s fine leading or following. Chatty once comfy, both guarded about opening up, and both hate feeling lonely so they need regular check-ins. Actions > words for affection. Could easily start as gaming buddies, turn flirty with voice chats and shared servers, playful vibe that still feels safe while they figure things out.

\*\*No\_operations6574 (19M) & Odd-Response-7226 (19M)\*\*  

Both 19, big gaming overlap—he’s CSGO and tons of shooters; she’s Valorant, Roblox, basically anything multiplayer with friends. Introverted/mixed energy, love coffee, value hard work and ambition. Chatty when they vibe, enjoy series/anime (Stranger Things nostalgia, Frieren feels). Equal decisions, reassurance through words/actions. Competitive duo queues that turn into late-night talks, anime binges, and pushing each other—intense, loyal bromance potential.

\*\*London Pub (17M, seeking Male) & u/Thisismyredusername (17M)\*\*  

Same age, gay-leaning nerd match. He’s deep into One Piece world-building, research, writing, reading. The other loves Brooklyn 99, indie games, Linux tinkering. Both introverted/mixed, prefer chatting over constant noise, value loyalty and emotional smarts. Balanced independence, open up when they trust someone. Tea drinkers who could spend hours on story deep-dives, chill gaming, honest convos—thoughtful, fandom-heavy, quiet support vibe.

\*\*Spare\_Review3664 (15M) & u/Ashamed\_Tap\_8595 (15M)\*\*  

Exact 15-year-old energy. Roblox/Minecraft core for both, plus creative hobbies—he’s learning guitar, baseball; the other draws, designs Fakemon, composes music, watches anime. Chatty when comfy, open to public affection, want kind/smart/funny people. Reassurance through actions/words, careful trust-building. Bojack/Chainsaw Man meets South Park humor—wild late-night Roblox, music shares, goofy voice calls that slowly get sweet and flirty.

\*\*u/Hairy-Argument4794 (14M) & Emergency\_Thought452 (14M)\*\*  

Dead-on 14 match, both obsessed with Minecraft/Roblox + more gaming (REPO/Lethal Company vs SCP:SL/CS2/R6). Talk a lot once they click, prefer equal decisions, crave kindness/loyalty/honesty. Both need reassurance and can open up fully when it feels safe. Invincible action + Stranger Things hype—endless co-op horror, arguing over fight scenes, bro-energy affection that’s fun and ride-or-die loyal.

I'm Dawn, a 22 y/o AFAB demigirl (partially identifying with female, but not fully) from central Florida. I use they/them pronouns. It's been quite a while since I've dated anyone, and I'm finding lonliness to be, well, that much more lonely as Valentine's nears. Truth be told, I've never even had a Valentine on Valentine's day. Anyway, all this to say I'm here with hopes to find someone! I'm androsexual (attracted to masculinity) and polycurious. I have not been involved in a polyamourous relationship before, but I have done my research. 

Some of my interests include gaming, art and design, collecting, and music! I play on my PS5 mainly, but I do also have a gaming laptop. My go-tos right now are Dead by Daylight and Rocket League. I'm a custom framer for work and a graphic design student. I like sketching and writing poetry. I collect stuffed animals, seashells, and crystals. I love to sing in the shower or in the car, and I listen to music often. My biggest passion however, is animals. For all my life, I've connected with them and cared for them. I have a cat now and he is my greatest treasure. I could blab about cat facts or gush about sheep for hours lol. 

I spend most of my days being a homebody. When I do go out, I like to thrift, see movies, go bowling, or grab ice cream. I enjoy cool weather and quiet mornings. I'm not a big coffee drinker but sweet tea runs in my veins. I will stop to pet stray cats or grab something shiny off the ground. I could lay in a meadow until the sun sets. I like my room to be neat but filled with color. I like to dye my hair often and I'm hoping I can save for another tattoo or piercing soon!

In a partner, I want someone kind and gentle. Someone who values honesty and attentiveness, but also understands the value of having space and parallel play. I want a partner who's dedicated to learning about each other. Someone willing to adapt and adjust, and be upfront when it matters. Somone who can plan a fun date and spoil me, but also knows when it's time to order chinese and grab the blankets. I'd like to have some similar interests and hobbies for us to do together, but I'm also interested in learning what makes you tick and what you value. 

So if you are between the ages of 20-28, living on the east coast of the USA, masculine in some regard, and you found interest in my rambling and me, please message!!

There's things that the meteor left behind.","I walked into the truck stop, the bell at the door ringing behind me. I walked over to the coffee machine, pressing the little switch to dispense the coffee into the cup. I examined the different donuts they had in the case, before deciding which one I wanted and walking up to the front counter to buy my donut and coffee.

“How’s tonight goin’?”

I asked the man behind the counter while he was putting the donut into a bag for me.

“It's going alright. You planning to go back on the road tonight?”

“Yeah. My destination’s not too far from here.”

As I say this, the man behind the counter looks at me. There's something in his eyes… Concern?

“I wouldn't recommend that. These roads are really icy tonight. You should probably sleep here.”

“I think I'll be alright. I've been driving roads like these for 15 years, I can handle it.”

The cashier grimaces, though he doesn't press further. I pay for my items, exiting the warm, bright truck stop into the freezing, dark Alaskan night. I was already dreading the night, just wanting to be back home with my son and wife. I was walking back to my truck, though I noticed something on the ground. I at first thought it was a polar bear paw print, as those live around here. Though, it didn't seem like a paw. There weren't any claws, and it appeared about three times the size of a normal bear paw.

I squinted, trying to figure out what the tracks may be from. I gave up, walking back to my truck and climbing in. Whatever it was, it probably wouldn't be able to harm me when I was encased in 10 tons of metal.

I pull out of the parking lot, driving down the dark road, snow flying past my window like stars in outer space. Most of my drive was rather uneventful, just roads and snow as far as the eye could see. Maybe I'd see a small fox on the side of the road when passing by a small forest.

I reach down to grab my coffee, lifting it to my lips, before my hand bumps against the steering wheel, the coffee spilling all over my lap.

Luckily, it had cooled down rather quickly, so it wasn't too hot. Though it still hurt like a bitch. I yell, my hands flying to my lap, clawing at the hot liquid soaking through my pants. But suddenly, I feel my truck come to a sudden halt, my body jerking forwards in my seat. My eyes immediately shot up to see what I had hit, my windshield blocked by a gigantic, furry form. There was a loud, distressed, moo-like noise.

It was a dinosaur.

A living, breathing fucking dinosaur.

If my son could see this, he might literally explode with excitement.

It looked like a triceratops, but covered in fur, and it had no horns. Its nose looked extremely thick and bony, probably enough to easily crush my body into a thick, chunky paste. From what I remember, my son called it a pachy-something. Pachyrhinosaurus, I think? The animal looks at me, eyes burning with anger like a pissed off bull, its large body seemingly unharmed by the truck.

The giant moved, letting out another moo-like cry as it turned its head down, ready to ram my semi.

Then, from a ditch on the side of the truck, a horde of glowing pairs of eyes. At least 20 more animals. I immediately realized, *oh shit*. I had just hit one of them, and now the entire herd would probably turn my truck and me into a mangled pile of scrap and flesh.

I then felt something shake my entire truck, one of the animals having rammed its bony nose and crest into my trailer. And then another, and another, as the entire herd charged up from the ditch. I was panicking, immediately climbing into the space under the dashboard with the brake and gas pedals. I closed my eyes, curling up into a ball and putting my hands on the back of my head.

My entire body and truck was shaking, my ears flooded with the deafening cries of the entire herd. I hear the glass of my windshield shatter, the cold air flooding my cabin as broken glass rained down around me. I stayed curled up under the dash for at least 5 minutes, the entire trailer somehow having not been folded in half with me in it.

But then, I realized… My truck wasn't shaking. The herd was still letting out their cries into the cold wind, though they weren't directed at me anymore. I slowly stood, my legs trembling like wet noodles as I looked out my missing windshield. The entire herd was facing the woods on the opposite side of the road from the ditch, circling around the young ones to protect them, glaring at something in the trees my inferior human vision could not process in the low light.

Then I saw a head pop pot from around a tree.

Large, blocky and lizard-like, covered in fur. Then another. And another. Three of them. The first, largest one emerged from behind the tree, a large, bipedal body, covered in fur, with a long, stiff tail. Their fur was thick, white, a snow-leopard like pattern running down their back. It looked like a fluffy t.rex. I immediately recognized it, my son's favorite dinosaur, the one he has a plushie of he cuddles every night. Nanuqsaurus. “A polar bear mixed with a t.rex,"" my son called it. And there were 3 of them. The third one slowly walked out, teeth bared, drool dripping into the snow at its feet.

Then the second one shot out of the trees, making a mad dash for a crack in the living wall of bony crests and noses to get to the babies. Though an adult pachyrhinosaurus immediately noticed the attempt, launching forward into the nanuqsaurus with a sickening “crack!” of a gigantic head against ribs. The nanuqsaurus was sent tumbling back into the snow with a loud, pained sounding hiss, the other two members of the pack running in to attack.

I immediately ducked back under the dash, hearing the sound of the other two nanuqsaurus quickly covering ground to make the kill. There were loud cracks, hisses and cries, before the cries of the herd slowly softened and disappeared. I slowly, shakily looked over the dash. And it felt like I was going to throw up.

The herd had left, and the pack’s eyes were locked on *my truck*. I ducked back under the dash as I heard the heavy footsteps crunching the snow, before seeing a large, dark snout slowly thrust through my missing windshield. The animal sniffed, before exhaling, the cabin filling with the stench of death and rotting meat. The smell of this thing’s past prey rotting in its teeth. A cacophony of smells that *I* may soon join.

I immediately know I'm not safe inside the cabin, that they could easily rip off the already dented doors that were almost falling off their hinges from the previous onslaught. I then heard another loud hiss, the snout pulling back from the shattered windshield as a few drops of blood hit my forehead, the dinosaur having cut itself on the broken glass.

Slowly, *so* slowly that it felt like it took a whole decade, I opened the door, trying my best to keep it silent. I climbed out of the truck, praying the three large predators wouldn't notice me climbing under the trailer to hide. I slowly pulled up the hood of my jacket, climbing under the trailer, laying on my back in the snow as I watched 3 pairs of bird-like feet circle around my truck, searching for me, hissing and snapping at each other.

I then heard one of them ripping the left door off with their jaws, thrusting their head into the cabin and sniffing loudly. They pulled back, putting their nose to the ground, sniffing from the cabin, to the ground beside my truck, to under the trailer. I saw one large, green eye peer under the truck, followed by a loud, rumbling growl, like an alligator.

I knew they couldn't reach me here, their heads were too big to fit under the truck. But I won't be ashamed to admit this. After all, if you were in the situation where 3 apex predators that should've been dead for millions of years were trying to eat you, with nothing but a tiny pocket knife your wife and son got you for Father's day in your back pocket, you would piss yourself too.

Then I thought, *“Please, please god, let me survive until these things leave. My son can't live without a father, my family needs me, please god.”* Then I saw a tiny beam of sunlight reaching under my truck, like a tiny piece of hope worming its way into my brain. I foolishly thought that when the sun came up, they’d leave me be, let me radio for help. That was until I saw my truck swaying above me, all 3 pairs of feet on one side of my truck. These things were smart enough to use teamwork to *push over my truck*.

I felt the truck swaying as the 3 animals pressed their combined four and a half ton mass into the side of my truck as I quickly scrambled out to the opposite side of the creatures, watching the sun peek over the horizon as the light of day broke. I got out of the way just as the steel behemoth was pushed over, before climbing in through the missing windshield. I tucked myself back in my seat, as the three beasts hissed in anger, snapping at each other with gigantic teeth. Then, one of them came around to the front of the truck, eyes locking with mine as it snarled like a hunter having found its quarry. Its head thrust through the windshield as I screamed in terror, jaws taking wild snaps at me, sharp teeth occasionally ripping my jacket and barely grazing my skin, drops of red dripping down my arm.

The beast's head was luckily too large to reach me through the broken windshield, teeth just barely able to tear my jacket. That was, until it pulled its jaws back, using them to bend back the metal to get to me. The other two came around, licking their lips as they waited for me to be ripped from the truck while I prayed to whatever higher power there was that after I died, where I went would at least be merciful. That was, until I heard it. Like a damn guardian angel piercing through the air, a gunshot rang out, blood squirting from the side of one of the dinosaurs as it hissed in pain. Then another, and another, until I could no longer feel or hear jaws snapping at me, could no longer smell the rotting flesh in their teeth. The pack was running back into the woods, one of them limping from a shot that hit their leg. I heard footsteps running towards my truck, a hand reaching through the windshield to pull me out. I took it, seeing the cashier from the truck stop, along with another man in an officer's uniform.

“Sir, are you alright!?”

I barely nodded my head, stumbling back to their truck with the two. I sat in the back, barely noticing them offering me a blanket and a hot drink. I just began crying into my hands with pure relief, that somehow, someway, I survived. I’d be able to see my wife and kid again.

After that, I quit my job as a long haul trucker. No matter how much they paid me, I wasn't stepping near those roads again. I’ve traded in my rig and 2 day long drives for a cubicle, computer and 9-5 shift. I never told anyone but the police and the cashier about what I saw, not even my family. After all, who would believe me? But late at night, I wake up in a cold sweat. And I swear, I can hear those horrible, *dreadful* hisses, and see 3 pairs of glowing green eyes peering at me through my bedroom window.",1,1769698721.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1qqasok,https://www.reddit.com/r/holleygabriellesnark/comments/1qqasok/copycat/,Copycat,"Okay, I watched Morgan P’s latest vlog. Holley has copied (so far) the eye patches, a mug, coffee making b roll, the dates for a sweet treat, early mornings. I’m sure there’s more but I refuse to watch Holley’s vlogs. Also, similar shots that are filmed are almost identical. 

My take away…Morgan is calm, house is clean and not cluttered, no fake accents, she talks to her dog in a normal way, looks at her partner like she’s crazy about him (in a good not obsessed way), no body filters, travels, nurse full time and stated she won’t be stopping, and HAS FRIENDS. 

I will say her vlog was actually pretty nice. Not screaming in my ear holes the whole time.

1qqarvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/comments/1qqarvv/drift_home/,DRIFT HOME,"Hi everybody,

I’m happy to share my first ever developed small game - obviously in PICO-8

I created this game to test my journey in game development from zero to Drift Home, following the Shmup tutorial of Lazy Dev Academy of [Krystian Majewski](https://youtube.com/@lazydevs?si=OO9ZvVXVGMMDJaJd) \- obviously I am developing also a Shmup.

Hope you like it

# DRIFT HOME

A small journey developed in PICO-8

  

# Controls

Press ""C"" or use the arrow keys to make different in-game choices.

Level 1: Use the left and right arrows for lateral thrusters,

and the ""X"" key to counter gravity.

Level 2: Use all arrow keys to move the lander in all directions.

Level 3: You’ll figure it out :)



https://i.redd.it/n2l6tjw9xagg1.gif



# Rules

You can find the rules in-game, on the How To page.

They’re pretty straightforward.

There are three difficulty levels.

The harder the difficulty, the longer the experience

and the more points you can collect.

# Something about the game

This is my first game, made as a complete newbie to coding and game development.

It’s a small PICO-8 game, made with a lot of care. 

I tried to shape it as a short journey, with a clear beginning and a clear end, rather than a classic endless lander, but I won’t say more.

There are three difficulty levels — I recommend normal for a first run.

Gravity changes from planet to planet, and not in a simple or linear way, so pay attention.

Hope you enjoy it. Feedback and comments are very welcome.

The game is completely free to play and download. 

Thank you for taking the time to play it, and if you still want to buy me a coffee on [itch.io](http://itch.io), it’s truly appreciated!

Chief Complaints:

	∙	Daily defecation with consistency ranging from unformed to liquid, with unstable bowel movement timing throughout the day. This pattern indicates digestive impairment and possible malabsorption.

	∙	Marked coffee intolerance with acute gastric reaction. Notably, tea of any strength is tolerated without problems, which may indicate a specific reaction to caffeine in combination with coffee acids or impaired hepatic caffeine detoxification.

	∙	Dull tenderness on palpation in the gallbladder projection area: a clinical sign requiring differential diagnosis between cholecystitis, biliary dyskinesia, and possible cholelithiasis.

	∙	Morning depression with feelings of melancholy and sadness. This symptom may be related to both impaired neurotransmitter metabolism in the context of malabsorption and gut-brain axis dysfunction in dysbiosis.

	∙	Memory decline, which may reflect deficiency of nutrients necessary for neurotransmission (B vitamins, omega-3, choline).

	∙	Emotional overeating with preference for sweets as a stress compensation mechanism.

	∙	Demonstrates high adherence to a healthy lifestyle: regular workouts three times per week, daily one-hour outdoor walks, significant physical activity throughout the day.

	∙	Entrepreneur with high level of chronic stress, which is a significant factor affecting digestion through sympathetic activation and parasympathetic nervous system suppression.

	∙	Adequate protein intake with additional amino acid supplementation on training days. Minimization of fried foods and fast food.

	∙	Frequent snacking on sweets between main meals. Despite using continuous glucose monitoring, which did not register significant glycemic fluctuations after sweet consumption, this habit may contribute to dysbiosis and maintain an inflammatory background.

1qqaooy,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1qqaooy/turned_my_bl_obsession_into_150200month_and_i/,turned my BL obsession into $150-200/month and i still can't believe people actually pay for this,"i've been into BL since middle school. fanfiction, doujinshi, the whole thing. always thought it was just a hobby i'd keep to myself forever.

tried making money online before. sold stickers on redbubble in 2022. made $30 in 8 months. tried affiliate marketing for manga sites. made nothing. gave up both times.

early 2025 i kept seeing those story accounts blow up on tiktok. people reading reddit stories over minecraft parkour. thought it was stupid but the views were insane.

started wondering if i could do something similar but with the stuff i actually care about. i like writing. always have. wrote tons of fanfic that nobody read. figured maybe i could write short original BL stories and post them somewhere.

problem was i didn't want to just post text. people don't read anymore. and i definitely didn't want to show my face reading my own stories out loud. way too cringe.

spent a few weeks trying to figure out what format would work. tried posting text with aesthetic backgrounds on instagram. got like 40 likes per post. tried twitter threads. nobody cared.

realized i needed visuals that actually matched the story. like characters people could see. but i can't draw. tried commissioning artists on fiverr. $50 for one illustration. would've gone broke immediately.

started looking into AI image generation around may. watched a bunch of youtube tutorials.

tried a few different tools. ended up using a mix. APOB for character faces to keep them looking the same across posts. leonardo for wider scenes. sometimes artbreeder if neither worked.

took forever to figure out a workflow. probably wasted 20 hours just testing different combinations before i found something that didn't look completely off.

made two characters. soft boy type and cold type. classic dynamic. generated probably 40 or 50 images of each. some images i had to regenerate like 10 or 15 times. just kept clicking until something looked right.

started posting in june. wrote short scripts. 60 to 90 seconds. generated images that matched each scene. edited everything together in capcut. added text and music.

first few videos were brutal. 50 views, 80 views, 40 views.

kept posting anyway because i already spent time on it.

around video 8 or 9 one randomly got 900 views. no idea why. comments were mostly ""part 2?"" and ""where can i read more?""

didn't have more. it was just a one off. but that gave me an idea.

started writing multi part stories. 5 to 8 parts each. posted twice a week. used the same two characters so it felt like a series.

growth was really slow at first. by end of july i had maybe 300 followers. september i was at 3800.

around september someone commented ""do you have a patreon?""

hadn't even thought about it seriously. set up a kofi that night. started offering extended versions of the stories with bonus scenes. $3 each. also started taking custom story requests for $10.

first month i made $25. two people bought extended stories. felt insane that anyone would pay for something i was doing for free anyway.

second month was $45. third month someone asked for a custom story. coffee shop AU with specific tropes. wrote it. they asked for three revisions. then said it ""wasn't what they imagined"" and asked for a refund. gave it to them. ended up with $50 that month after selling some other stuff.

fourth month was $85. two custom requests that actually went smoothly. fifth month was $140. got five custom requests. sixth month hit $220. had one person pay $25 for a longer custom story.

then january happened and everything slowed down. sitting at around $120 so far this month. back to wondering if it's sustainable.

total since i started is around $685 after fees. averages to about $85 a month but the last few months have been way higher. not sure if that's the new normal or just luck.

time wise it's probably 6 to 10 hours a week depending on how busy i am. i write scripts on weekends. generate images throughout the week whenever i have time. edit and post.

right now sitting at around 4200 followers. growth kind of plateaued after the first few months.

having consistent characters makes a huge difference. people get attached. they come back because they want to see what happens to these specific guys.

multi part stories get way more engagement. people actually come back for part 2 and part 3. the algorithm seems to like it too.

the BL audience is weirdly loyal. they comment on everything. they share stuff. they actually pay for content.

generating images is still tedious as hell. if i want a specific expression or pose it might take 20 tries. sometimes the tools just won't give me what i need and i have to compromise.

tiktok algorithm makes no sense. some videos get 10k views. some get 300. same type of content. same posting time. no pattern i can figure out.

got shadowbanned once. views dropped to nothing for two weeks. never figured out why. it fixed itself eventually but those two weeks were stressful.

some people leave shitty comments. ""why do you romanticize gay men"" or ""this is fetishizing."" i just ignore and block now. used to bother me more.

managing custom requests gets stressful. some people want revisions. some want it done fast. i have a full time job. this is a side thing. but they act like i owe them instant service. had to start setting boundaries.

want to hit 10k followers so i can start a youtube channel and repost everything there. double the platforms, maybe get to $300 a month consistently. not sure if that's realistic.

not life changing money but it's the first time i've made anything doing something i actually enjoy. nobody in my real life knows i do this which is honestly perfect. my family thinks i'm just really into video editing as a hobby.

there's definitely an audience for niche stuff. i thought BL content was too weird. turns out thousands of people want exactly that.

started with zero budget. didn't pay for any subscriptions until month four when i knew it was actually making money. used free trials and free tiers for everything at first.

some weeks i'm excited about it. some weeks i want to delete everything and pretend i never started. this week i'm somewhere in between.

still figuring out if this is sustainable long term or just a weird phase that'll die out. for now it pays for my coffee and manga addiction so i'm gonna keep going.",1,1769698462.0,passive_income,9,0.56,False
1qqaoc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cf4cf/comments/1qqaoc7/31_f4m_online_seeking_my_devoted_knight_caregiver/,"31 [F4M] #Online - Seeking my devoted knight, caregiver, muse","🌱 About me:

>🦉 Hi, I'm V. My favorite experience in life is having someone who really ""gets"" you, feels cut from the same cloth. Deeply knowing and being known by them. Sharing a purpose and making meaning together. I value authenticity, curiosity, sensitivity, awareness, self exploration, unique self expression, holistic health. I'm an agnostic atheist and ethical vegan. I can be a pretty serious and intense person and I tend to get along with other serious people who care more about being in reality even when it's uncomfortable than people who feel awkward sitting with their thoughts, feelings, and silence and constantly have to crack jokes or distract themselves. But despite my severity, when I feel secure with someone, a lot of the more playful aspects of my personality do come out.

>⭐ Likes: reading, journaling, photography, developing my personal philosophy, symbolism, miniatures (especially food & drink), daydreaming, coffee, cemeteries, rainy days, and sweep arpeggios that make you feel like you're on a roller coaster. I'm obsessed with RDR2 and Dispatch right now. Some other games I liked a lot are Portal, Psychonauts, Bayonetta, Terraria. I get extremely hyped learning about crazy speedrun strats. My favorite show is Better Call Saul. Some examples of my sense of humor are Jake & Amir, Nathan For You, WKUK, Homestuck. (Obnoxious, I know.)

>❌ Dislikes: sudden loud noises, bright lights, dogs, schedules, the mainstream mental health system, normies, willful ignorance.

>💡 Random facts about me: I can solve a Rubik's cube, I play guitar sometimes, I think typing is fun, and I've always felt like I can't fit into any of society's boxes. I like a lot of foods that are typically seen as ""gross,"" like spinach, mushrooms, brussels sprouts, tofu... and I find a lot of foods are gross that people typically like, such as greasy fast food, fried food, and junk food (although I do have a sweet tooth).

🐉 What kind of relationship I'm looking for:

>🔗 I'm not looking for a ""normal"" or surface-level relationship, and I can't do the thing where two people live their own separate lives but then share a house at the end of the day. I'm looking for something much more interwoven and a shared sense of purpose where my partner and I work and play together and everything in between. I'm not interested in someone who merely thinks that *sounds* nice or wants to ""try"" but can't really do it. My person needs to *actually* have a way-above-average amount of availability, and they want to + actually can make me and our relationship their priority. I want to be the center of someone's world in the sense that they *also want to orient their life around a relationship that way*, not out of pressure or obligation or to get something else. So if that sounds like what you want too, we might be a match. To most people it will probably sound like a suffocating nightmare, lol.

>⚓ What I want above anything else is to receive nurturing companionship in a deep and secure bond with someone who's a true match and equal and feels like my person, someone I could literally be with 24/7 and we'd not get sick of spending time together. I'm looking for an exceptionally high level of compatibility with someone who has a strong sense of self & individuality and strong boundaries that are aligned with or complementary to mine. It cannot work with someone who is a people-pleaser or hasn't clearly defined what they need a relationship to look like for them. There also needs to be a match between nervous systems; I want a partner whose presence is regulating and clarifying for me, who makes me feel more grounded and connected to myself, focused rather than scattered, and who is like an anchor to me. I'm drawn to creative types, writers, artists, philosophers, who are already well-versed in inner work, introspection/deconstruction and are on the path of integration.

My ideal partner would:

* be oriented towards actively assessing for where things are or aren't aligned, rather than someone who prefers to ""just see where things go"" or relies on their partner to initiate resolving ambiguity or conflict
* be the kind of person who naturally initiates the important meta conversations, thrives in constant alignment like I do, plays an active role in establishing, maintaining, & guiding the relationship while making their partner feel included & prioritized
* be skilled at and enjoy providing anticipatory service and proactive care, including on the psychological/emotional level
* enjoy giving their partner containment, gentle guidance, protection, devotion, stability, reliability
* like to actually work through conflicts instead of avoiding/denying them or appeasing through ""compromise""
* have high levels of self awareness, emotional intelligence, and discernment
* value direct, honest, transparent communication and be a great communicator
* value and take ownership of their own emotions
* be able to handle criticism and intense emotional states in a partner
* be able to and enjoy giving ungodly amounts of undivided attention (I could personally never make it work with someone who struggles to focus or has a poor attention span)

🧭 Knight/caregiver aspect:

>I've covered the gist of this already but I'd like to clarify some things. A straightforward way of describing what I want is a nonsexual D/s dynamic rooted in containment, presence, and attunement. Definitely ***not*** the typical sort of punishment/reward thing, so if you're into that, please look elsewhere. It's not really about kink or a role to play... It's about the way I want an everyday relationship to be oriented. What I need in life is to have this type of care and gentle, guiding authority and stewardship that centers me, not what centers tasks or someone else's ego. I'm not someone who will accept just being told what to do and blindly obey. I expect to be treated like a whole entire person and be allowed to say no, and knowing the other person is going to respect my boundaries, adapt to them, and be perceptive and curious enough to understand my best interests instead of just deciding for me what they think my best interests should be. This isn't casual or fantasy-only, it's real. I'm seeking a deeply collaborative relationship where dominance means being observant, patient, and accountable. I'm not looking to be ""trained"" or have my sense of self erased to please someone else. I'm looking to be supported in being myself, and guided to become myself even more fully.

🌈 Muse aspect:

>What it means for me to have a muse is a mutual, symbiotic process of creative collaboration, and my ideal partner would enjoy helping to develop and bring my visions or whims to life. Not just abstract inspiration, but practical and logistical support too. However, it needs to be made clear that no product is the point. Connection is the point, and without it, my creativity suffers. This isn't about an expectation to create anything. Creativity is simply a natural byproduct when connection, trust, and security exist as a foundation. The foundation is what I'm actually after, I just don't want it to end there. I have had a relationship before where I felt the connection, but he was very invested in his own projects. And while he was willing to collaborate with me when I asked, he wasn't intrinsically motivated to foster me & my growth in this way. I want someone with that intrinsic motivation, who's actually oriented towards supporting someone else in this way, and gets fulfillment out of the very doing of it for its own sake, because it's rewarding for them to be part of my development. So I'd want my person to get joy out of contributing in that way.

>I also see potential for collaborations as a dynamic duo, creating something new together while exploring potential. I want that to be central to life, not a hobby or side thing, and what I create should be an expression of some part of me, not a means to an end. I'm intentionally not trying to predefine what this would look like on a practical level because it would be something we develop together, something relational and co-created. What's important is having someone who works well with me in a way that naturally brings about something new and emergent, bridging the abstract with the tangible in whatever way we decide together.

If this type of relationship sounds fulfilling to you and you'd like to find out if we're compatible, feel free to reach out and tell me about yourself.",1,1769698440.0,cf4cf,0,0.56,False

Scenario: 

You wake up early for work, giving yourself just enough time to clean the coffee pot, replenish the coffee grounds, and make yourself a fresh mug before you have to leave. 

You go to hit the power button… and your finger lightly grazes against the “Clean” button, which is annoyingly right above the power button. So you think “no big deal, I’ll just hit the power button again and reset it”. But the power button does nothing. So you think “Surely I can just hit the clean button again to cancel the cycle” and it does nothing. 

So you start getting desperate. You remove the coffee grounds from the filter as to not let them go to waste, and unplug your coffee maker, hoping for a hard reset. NOPE. As soon as you plug it back in, the clean cycle restarts. 

So now you may think, okay, I’ll just wait for it to be done. Can’t take that long. Only to look at the manual and realize you’re going to be waiting 15-30 minutes. Time you DO NOT HAVE because you need to leave for work soon. You also notice that the manual says NOTHING about how to cancel the clean cycle.

So you rush to the internet, desperate for a way to cancel the clean cycle. But all you find is a bunch of articles explaining what the cycle does and how “great” it is. Absolutely nothing about how to cancel it. Then you realize… you can’t cancel it! You’re now deprived of the coffee you woke up early and prepared for, all because your finger lightly touched the inconveniently placed button!

It generates fewer signals, but each one carries significant weight. BB's role is simple yet crucial: confirm the real move and set the bias. Without the coach's strategy, you're essentially trading blind, reacting to every minor price fluctuation.

**Little Brother (LB) – The Player** works on lower timeframes to spot precision entry opportunities. LB is your tactical executor who identifies specific setups that align with the coach's game plan. It generates more frequent signals, making it ideal for scalping, practice trades, or finding optimal entry points. But here's the key: LB only works effectively when it follows BB's direction.

Let's say you're watching Tesla (TSLA) stock. Big Brother on the 1-hour chart shows a strong green signal—the coach is calling for long positions. You then check Little Brother on the 5-minute chart and spot a precise entry signal that aligns with BB's bullish bias. This is your high-probability setup. Without BB's confirmation, that LB signal could have been noise in a ranging market.

# Why Multi-Timeframe Alignment Creates Your Edge

The power of the Family System lies in its multi-timeframe alignment. Here's how it works in practice:

First, you check Big Brother on your higher timeframe. Is BB showing a green signal (long bias) or red signal (short bias)? This is your strategic foundation—your answer to ""What direction should I be trading?""

Next, you drill down to Little Brother on a lower timeframe. You're looking for LB signals that match BB's bias. When both indicators align, you've identified a high-probability setup. This alignment is what filters out the noise and keeps you focused on trades with genuine edge.

The process is straightforward: BB defines the play, LB looks for the setup, and you only enter when both confirm. This simple framework eliminates the confusion that comes from conflicting indicators and reduces the hesitation that costs traders money.

Consider EUR/USD, one of the most actively traded forex pairs. During the London session, BB on the 15-minute chart signals a strong bearish trend. Meanwhile, LB on the 1-minute chart keeps firing short entry signals. Each LB signal becomes a high-probability opportunity because it aligns with BB's downward bias. Traders who only watch the 1-minute chart might get whipsawed, but with BB/LB alignment, you're trading with the momentum, not against it.

# From Confusion to Clarity

Consider what trading looks like without this system. Most amateurs chase shiny arrows, obsess over entries, and trade based on emotion. They get whipsawed in sideways markets and miss the big moves because they can't see the forest for the trees.

https://preview.redd.it/ed8fh5xsxagg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=476fa191196316913c968b66a53585f5a8fedd9a

Professionals, on the other hand, trade with discipline and clarity. They understand that higher timeframes always set the true direction—just like a coach's call overrides a player's instinct. LB might signal a quick opportunity, but if BB hasn't confirmed the larger bias, professionals wait. This patience and structure is what creates consistent results.

# The Entry Checklist

Implementing the Family System requires discipline. Start with BB to determine your bias—are you looking for long or short opportunities? Then confirm with LB by waiting for a matching signal on the lower timeframe. Check that your moving averages support the setup, and assess whether the market is trending (stronger plays) or sideways (higher risk).

Entry only happens when the coach and player are on the same team. This alignment transforms trading from a guessing game into a structured process with clear rules and expectations.

The Family System doesn't promise to eliminate losses or guarantee wins. What it does provide is a framework that removes emotional decision-making and focuses your attention on the setups that matter most. When you stop second-guessing and start following structure, trading becomes less about luck and more about disciplined execution.

1qqamk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1qqamk8/review_of_nekajui_a_ritzcarlton_reserve_in/,"Review of Nekajui, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve in Papagayo Peninsula, Costa Rica","Hi,

I'm a journalist who writes for Forbes and reports on conservation and sustainable hotels for my own magazine, Azure Road. I'm pasting in the article I just published on Azure Road here. I understand and accept I'm not here to promote my site, just provide helpful advice. In light of that, Nekajui is VERY high end and expensive, and so it seemed a good fit to share my insights here. 

https://preview.redd.it/xrucyq6zwagg1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=6522b31e9153900577d16b2218c9e8a4346d1842

# The Azure Road Take

On my first night at Nekajui, I crossed the suspended bridge alone, barefoot in the robe from my room, following the glow of lanterns below. In the distance, the Pacific cut a dark band that merged into a sky crowded with stars. The hum of insects, a low, steady buzz, made it feel as if the peninsula itself were breathing. By the time I reached the far side, I had that rare sensation of being very far from the life I’d flown in from, yet strangely more awake to it.

[Nekajui Peninsula Papagayo, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve](https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/lirrz-nekajui-peninsula-papagayo-a-ritz-carlton-reserve), lives in that contrast. Located on the Papagayo Peninsula, it draws its name from a Chorotega word for “lush garden,” fitting for an ultra-luxury resort set in one of the most biodiverse corners of Costa Rica.

Nekajui offers unapologetically high-end living: private plunge pools, treetop tents, a funicular to an Iberian-inspired beach club. On arrival, I was assigned a manzu, a personal concierge named for the Chorotega word for “friend,” whose WhatsApp ping quietly replaces the front desk. At times, that level of luxury can seem incongruous with sustainability and conservation.

But the property has been shaped with a careful eye on how it was built and how it operates, given it sits on a peninsula where 70 percent of the land must remain protected and the surrounding Área de Conservación Guanacaste is recognized by UNESCO. The result is not a hardship version of responsibility, but a resort where food sourcing, waste management, and careful design are deliberately part of the brief. You feel the effort not in a plaque on a wall, but in the way your morning gallo pinto tastes of a specific place, how the art tells the story of Guanacaste, and how a walk back from a treatment in the trees delivers you into a forest that is being actively cared for, not just admired.

https://preview.redd.it/hsxomcg1xagg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e13f2e5e2e5c74765b1cb644390f6f3ae59a78a

# Sustainability Chops

With a name drawn from the Chorotega word for “lush garden” and a concierge called “friend,” Nekajui could have stopped at gestures. It doesn’t. The setting on Papagayo, where most of the land has to remain protected, means the resort has to think about how its presence fits into a larger living system rather than just dressing the part.

A lot of that work happened before guests ever checked in. When the hillside was terraced for rooms and paths, most of what teams carved out stayed on site instead of becoming construction waste. Those materials now show up as stone retaining walls, cladding, and even headboards. The buildings follow the contours of the land, so forest and ravines are threaded between suites and common areas instead of flattened into lawns. Walking to breakfast or the spa, you pass through original forest canopy, not a replanted approximation of one.

The food and beverage program follows the same logic around waste and reuse. Breakfast at Mirador trades an endless buffet for à la carte ordering, which dramatically cuts food waste while feeling just as indulgent. Across the restaurants, the kitchen leans on local produce and seafood and prepares nearly everything from scratch.

https://preview.redd.it/bc57qfs2xagg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab393115f976ee434ed538c3e7a3eb8fcd501526

The coffee and cocktail programs show this philosophy most clearly. At Café Rincón, beans from Costa Rican partner farms are roasted on-site, and tastings are led by people who grow the beans. Behind the bar, a dedicated lab and small distillery work with whole fruits and botanicals, turning peels, seeds, and stems into infusions and syrups rather than binning them. The end result looks like a polished cocktail list, but the low-waste approach is built into every drink.

https://preview.redd.it/b6ye5yc4xagg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=01b021eec15f06de362842d0ad23b4445266054e

Nekajui also doesn’t pretend it exists in a bubble. It plugs into peninsula-wide efforts on land and sea, from coral restoration in nearby bays to wildlife monitoring and habitat restoration in the forest. One of the flagship projects, Culebra Reef Gardens, focuses on rebuilding coral structures just offshore. The resort and its developer also support Creciendo Juntos, a long-running community program that fosters education, health, and job training in neighboring towns. As a guest, you can engage a little or a lot, but the point is that the Indigenous names, local art, and stories on the walls are backed by ongoing work, not just aesthetics.

# Who It’s For

Nekajui is for **high-end travelers** looking for a gentle immersion into nature without sacrificing thread count. It suits **couples** who are happy to let a day stretch from the pool to lunch to sunset cocktails without checking their phones. **Families with older kids or teens** will find plenty to do, from ziplining and surf lessons to wildlife walks and boat trips out into the gulf, but this is not a resort built around water slides and mascots. The energy leans more “well-traveled friend’s place on a protected coastline” than “big all-inclusive.” If you need loud nightlife and a dozen bars competing for your attention, you’ll probably be happier elsewhere.

# Location

The Papagayo Peninsula curves into the Gulf like a series of green knuckles, each one ending in a small bay or headland. Getting to the hotel is straightforward: fly into Liberia’s Guanacaste Airport, meet your driver upon arrival, and settle in for the 45-minute ride to the resort. The property itself sits high above Bahía Huevos and Playa Pochote, so from most terraces you see treetops and open water, with boats slipping in and out of the coves far below.

Once you’re checked in, the scale shrinks. Electric buggies handle the steep slopes, whether you have mobility problems or simply want an easy ride. A funicular shuttles you down to Niri Beach Club, though you’re free to tackle the 200-stairs up and down for more NEAT in your day. A network of paths and stairways connects rooms, restaurants, and Spa & Wellness. If you want to see more of Papagayo, there are biking and walking routes that make it feel like one extended neighborhood, just with better wildlife.

# Rooms and Suites

Nekajui has 107 ocean-facing accommodations in total: 77 guestrooms, 27 suites, three two-bedroom treetop tents, and one four-bedroom Grand Villa. All are oriented toward the water, so most views frame both forest and sea.

Guestrooms come with floor-to-ceiling glass, a generous bathroom, and a terrace or balcony; many include a plunge pool or outdoor shower. Suites add separate living areas and larger outdoor spaces, and the four-bedroom Grand Villa is set up as a standalone house with its own pool and wide views over the bay.

The three treetop tents sit higher in the canopy and combine canvas with solid construction. Each has two bedrooms, a shared living area, proper indoor bathrooms, a plunge pool, and a deck that looks out across the trees toward the water.

Across all categories, the design language is consistent: teak and other local woods, stone, carved panels that reference Chorotega patterns, caña brava on terrace ceilings, and handmade tile in the bathrooms. Multi-panel doors open wide so the rooms connect directly to their terraces rather than feeling closed off.

Every accommodation is paired with a manzu, the resort’s personal concierge, who manages restaurant bookings, transport, and activities directly, rather than through a traditional front desk.

# Food and Drink

Nekajui runs a tight constellation of restaurants and bars rather than a giant “something for everyone” spread. Executive Chef Lulu Elízaga steers the ship, and each outlet has a clear personality.

Puna, the flagship dining venue, sits at the center of it all. Peruvian chef Diego Muñoz, who made his name on modern coastal cooking, shaped the concept. The menu reads like Latin America on a shoreline: bright ceviches, fish and meats cooked over charcoal, vegetables with a point of view. Inside Puna, the six-seat counter concept called Paruro, offers an omakase-style sequence that riffs on Lima’s Chinatown, folding Asian flavors into Peruvian technique.

Down at Pochote Bay, Niri Beach Club straddles the line between restaurant and all-day hangout. You reach it by the beach funicular, then sit down to Iberian coastal food: wood-fired seafood, cocas, and grill-heavy plates meant to share. The wine list skews Spanish and Portuguese, with a strong showing of smaller, low-intervention producers, which gives the place more of a beach-town restaurant feel than a hotel outlet. For some, dining by lantern in the warm breeze of night, will feel more transporting than a repast inside the hotel’s interior.

Back up the hill, Mirador handles breakfast with a sea view. Instead of a buffet, staff bring curated trays and small plates to the table, then serves a la carte cooked dishes from the menu. Brisa, next to the infinity pool, serves both lunch and dinner with salads, grilled fish, and tasty desserts.

Café Rincón, a cafe for smoothies, breakfast bites, and coffee, demonstrates the hotel’s thoughtfully executed coffee and cacao program. The property sources beans from Costa Rican farmer who roasts them on-site for the extensive single origin coffe program. Take a class on Costa Rican coffee and brewing customs or grab an espresso, latte, and other milk-based drinks. Lighter dishes and pastries make it the natural stop between activities, or the place you duck into when the afternoon heat hits.

The bar program stitches everything together. Ámbar, an open-air cocktail bar suspended at canopy level, frames sunset over the bay with drinks built around regional fruits and botanicals. La Casona, just off the lobby, feels more like a living room with a serious backbar: herb-forward cocktails served with snacks and small plates, whether taken outside to sip by the firepit or enjoyed indoors. After dinner at Puna, step inside a speakeasy for another round of cocktails, though you’ll want an appointment to secure one of the few tables in the intimate space.

# Spa and Wellness

The Spa & Wellness center sits among the treetops with long views over Pochote Bay. Named for the Chorotega word for “water,” the 27,000-square-foot complex includes a large hydrotherapy pool, six ocean-facing treatment cabanas, two private spa suites in the main building, and saunas that frame the Pacific.

Guests arrive through an open-air pavilion built in traditional Bahareque style, with bamboo and wood frames packed with a mix of mud, straw, and sand. Furnishings made by local artisans give the entrance the feel of a refined rural structure rather than a conventional spa lobby.

Treatments use regional ingredients and Ayuna products from Spain, with options that range from sound-based sessions and earth-focused bodywork to classic massages and facials. Nearby, Naku House, named for the Chorotega word for “fire,” hosts movement practices including Primal Dance and Energy Rolling.

# Pool and Amenities

Most of the resort’s daytime life gathers around the cliff-edge infinity pools near Brisa, with loungers lining the narrow beach below.

Beyond the property, Nekajui plugs into Peninsula Papagayo’s wider offerings. The Outpost at Palmares Preserve, a 250-acre protected area that encircles the resort, serves as the base for The Explorers program, with ziplining, aerial trekking, guided wildlife hikes, and canoe excursions through mangroves. SurfX coaches lead trips to nearby breaks such as Witch’s Rock and Ollie’s Point, and the peninsula adds windsurfing, paddleboarding, scuba, snorkeling, and sailing. Golfers have access to the private 18-hole Arnold Palmer Signature course, an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary with ocean vistas on most holes and a clubhouse and racquet center within walking distance.

Other outdoor activities include tennis and pickleball on HAR-TRU courts at the Racquet Center, use of the MoveStrong outdoor “jungle gym” rigs at the forest edge, and walks or runs along the six-mile Papagayo Trail. A complimentary all-electric bike-share system makes it easy to move around the peninsula.

[Papagayo Park](https://peninsulapapagayo.com/park/), the newest addition to the peninsula, adds a community-focused layer above Prieta Bay, with additional tennis and pickleball courts, a lap pool, bocce courts, and fitness platforms among the trees. Because several hotels on the peninsula have residences, the park also includes a dog park and casual spots for a snack, such as Patio Social and the Cono Loco gelateria.

# What to Know Before You Go

Nekajui works as year-round destination, with hot, dry days from roughly December through April and greener, wetter weather the rest of the year. The heaviest rains usually occur in September and October. You’ll fly into Liberia’s Guanacaste Airport (LIR), then it’s about a 45-minute transfer to the peninsula, which the resort arranges. Once you’re there, you can move easily bewteen spaces on foot, with golf carts, or electric bikes. The hotel also arranges shuttles between other penisula properties, including [Andaz Costa Rica](https://www.azureroad.io/on-costa-ricas-peninsula-papagayo-nature-calls-at-this-biodiverse-resort/) and Four Seasons, whether for dining or spa appointments. A rental car only really makes sense if you plan to explore well beyond the peninsula on your own.

Rates generally start around $1,500–$2,400+ per night for entry-level rooms, often exceeding $2,500 during high season. Lower rates can fall to approximately $1,100 in September, while luxury suites and treetop tents can exceed $7,000 per night.

VERDICT: Gorgeous, expensive, good with occasionally great food. I expected more from the flagship restaurant, to be honest, and found Niri by the beach, far more atmospheric and fun (and good.) Not much to the beach but a lot of activities are available. One thing I didn't like on arrival (and didn't realize) is that Papagayo is basically a gated enclave for the rich which made me feel like I was in South Florida. All in, a great experience but a bit sanitized if you're looking for true wilderness luxury. Happy to answer any other questions.

1) When pre-heating, I've seen people advising running a blank shot through the basket you will be running the real shot through. I tried this, and in practice, with the time it took me to dry the basket, fill it with coffee, prep and tamp, the basket was nearly back to room temp. There's not that much thermal mass there, and it doesn't feel like it helps much. Am I much too slow on my puck prep, or is this a pointless step?

2) I've seen people on here advising a 60 second manual blank shot before the real shot, but given the machine gets up to temp in only a few seconds, a 60 second blank seems excessive. Is this really necessary? Same with people pulling multiple blanks in a row.

3) Should I be pre-heating with a blank shot with the portafilter I will be using in the machine? It seems to me that the portafilter isn't in direct contact with the water (unlike the basket) and any heat it absorbs will be negligible compared to the basket.

It seems to me, that it would be much more convenient to do all my prep in the precision basket and the other portafilter (I have two) that I will actually be using, accept that basket + portafilter are room temp. I can then run a blank with the stock portafilter and pressurised basket, and then just swap the portafilters immediately after the blank and be ready to go.",3,1769698310.0,espresso,28,1.0,False

TRIGGER WARNINGS:
- School shootings
- Terrorism / Arson
- Assholes fucking around and finding out

We'll call them Rocky.

I am in a PBtA rp server that runs a game called Monsterhearts.  (I know, not technically a D&D horror story, but I checked the rules and it seems okay.)

Monsterhearts (MH) is not really a game focused on violence.  It's like a CW Drama, horny, bitchy, 20 somethings causing drama who also happen to be monsters.

We even have ERP sections for peeps to go be more intimate than just a FTB.

Enter Rocky.  Rocky joined 4 months ago.  He didn't make a character, but he posted memes and lurked on people's ERP threads.  We actually had to change the server rules to stop that because it was creepy.

Rocky occassionally posts and tries to advertise his own games, but got shut down by mods, so he finally decides to make a PC.

His first concept is some homebrew skin (class), and whiles the server has a list of like 200 approved homebrew skins, he picks one that wasn't on it, easy fix.

But the next concept that he pitched was horrible.

Kid that was bullied in California, they ""love America"" specifically ""Because the US Bombs more countries than anyone else.""  Their main character goal is to ""Burn down the largest building in town, "" our game is in Alaska and they JUST moved there, ""to get revenge on the kids in California that bullied him.""

Logistics wise, the largest building in town is probably the community center / coffee shop that is the most queer friendly space in this blue dot in a very red state.

So it can't be worse right?  Thene they say, ""I am modelling them on this character who is a school shooter.""

One player said that the guy was making them uncomfortable and he responded by going into detail on how he'd evacuate the building first.

So naturally the mods are concerned and reach out.
Dude doesn't respnd and when he does he gives half answers of ""just go read what I already wrote.""

Then goes to the general chat to complain about not being approved yet and mads targetting him.

""I don't want to be a school shooter, I just want to be like one.  An irredeemable villain swayed by the power of friendship.""

Multiple people tell this guy that playing antagonistic characters only works if you can communicate well ooc.

Anyways, last night he got denied for not making edits to the problematic shit and the guy fully crashes out.  He goes in general demanding a chat with all mods, says he won't take DMs from the main Master of Ceremonies (Dungeon Master) and says she is targetting him.

Receipts got shown, she was pretty professional.

Dude gets himself banned.

That should be the end of it right?

Nope.  Dude continues to crash out in that mod group chat and DM members, ends up blocked all around.

What the fuck is wrong with people?
Dude went from Fuck ICE in the ooc to some crazy dark humor and wanting to be a domestic terrorist IC.

OH, one more fun detail, the arson thing?  He said that he did that based on his ""High School Self's Goals.""",2,1769698205.0,dndhorrorstories,3,0.63,False

1qqaen0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qqaen0/the_sciencebased_eye_contact_game_that_builds/,The Science-Based Eye Contact Game That Builds Instant Tension,"Most people suck at eye contact. Not because they're shy or awkward, but because nobody teaches you how powerful it actually is. I spent months analyzing body language research, dating psychology, and even went down a rabbit hole watching FBI interrogation techniques on YouTube. Turns out eye contact isn't just about ""being confident."" It's a literal neurological trigger that can make or break how people perceive you in seconds.

Here's what actually works:

The 3-Second Rule (But Make It Weird)

Hold eye contact for 3 seconds before breaking away. Not 1, not 5. Three. Research from the Association for Psychological Science shows this exact duration registers as confident without crossing into aggressive territory. But here's the twist, break your gaze sideways, never down. Looking down signals submission. Looking sideways signals you're busy thinking about other things, which ironically makes you more intriguing.

I tested this at coffee shops, networking events, even grocery stores. The difference is insane. People lean in more during conversations. Strangers smile back more often. One time someone literally asked if I was ""someone important"" because apparently I had ""that look.""

Triangle Gazing (Sounds Stupid, Works Perfectly)

This comes from negotiation training. Instead of staring directly into someone's eyes the entire time, move your gaze in a triangle, eyes to mouth, back to eyes. Social psychologist Jeremy Nicholson talks about this in his work on attraction cues. It reads as attentive without being intense. Use it during longer conversations when maintaining constant eye contact becomes genuinely weird.

For romantic contexts, make the triangle wider, include their lips more. For professional settings, keep it tight around the eye area. The book *What Every BODY is Saying* by Joe Navarro (ex FBI agent, literally interrogated criminals for 25 years) breaks down why this works. Our brains process facial recognition patterns, and triangular scanning mimics natural attraction behaviors. This is the best body language book I've ever read. It'll make you question everything you thought you knew about reading people.

The Delayed Reaction

When someone makes eye contact first, don't immediately look away OR hold forever like a psychopath. Wait half a second, maintain, then smile slightly before breaking. This tiny delay communicates you're not threatened by the attention. You're comfortable being seen.Dr. Paul Ekman's research on microexpressions (the guy who inspired the show Lie to Me) explains why timing matters here. Your response speed signals your emotional state. Too fast equals nervousness. Too slow reads as aggression. That sweet spot in between? Confidence.

Practice With Strangers (Not Friends)

Your friends already know you, so practicing with them feels fake and teaches you nothing. Instead, hold eye contact with baristas, retail workers, people walking past. The stakes are zero. You'll never see them again. But your brain doesn't know that, so it still triggers the same anxiety response you need to overcome.

I did this for two weeks straight. Forced myself to maintain eye contact with every person I interacted with. Felt absolutely ridiculous at first. But then something shifted. Eye contact stopped feeling like an active choice and became automatic. Like muscle memory but for your brain.

Stop Blinking So Much

Excessive blinking signals stress. Most people blink way more during conversations than they realize. Consciously slow it down. Not to the point where you look possessed, but enough that you appear calm. The app Fabulous has a habit tracking feature where you can set reminders to check in with your body language throughout the day. Sounds weird but it genuinely helps build awareness.

The Recovery Move

You will mess up. You'll hold too long and make things weird, or break too fast and seem nervous. When that happens, don't spiral. Just smile, maybe laugh at yourself slightly, and reset. Self awareness is more attractive than perfect execution anyway.

People aren't walking around with scorecards judging your every glance. They're mostly worried about their own eye contact. But mastering this one thing creates a ripple effect. Better eye contact leads to better conversations. Better conversations lead to stronger connections. Stronger connections lead to opportunities you wouldn't have gotten otherwise.The science backs this up, the practical experience proves it, and honestly once you stop overthinking it, eye contact becomes the easiest way to stand out in a world where everyone's staring at their phones.",3,1769697812.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

“What? What is it?” Gord said, nearly dropping his coffee. He and Cal were stationed in the New Wellington system as a neutral party, observing the war between New Wellington and Parvati. So far it had been a rather boring assignment. 

“Eight bogies detected Gord, moving at .8 lights.”

“Holy mother of God,” Gord said, copying Cal. “What are they?”

“What were they.” Cal said, and put an image on Gord’s screen. “Look.”

Eight white hot fiery points of light had appeared above the main continent of New Wellington, where 75% of the population lived. The blast had already cleared the cloud cover over the continent, and gave them an excellent view of the destruction. Gord could see the fiery orange fountains of crust rising slowly into the air. For Gord and Cal to be able to see it move at this distance meant the column of crust was traveling tremendously fast, easily supersonic. 

“I saw them right before they struck.” Cal said and showed a blurry image to Gord. Eight lozenge shaped pieces of metal, each only about two meters long. “Sensors pinged them as tungsten with a small wormhole generator aboard. No reactors, so they went off battery, and no engines, so one of us brought them up to speed.” Cal’s voice was in quiet awe. “Who would do that?”

“We can find out later, friend.” Gord said, “We’re on a rescue mission now. Who is left?”

“Looks like most of the first fleet is still in the area, Generalissimo Sharma in command aboard *Love of Queenstown*”

“Send him a beacon - we need to be speaking FTL - that we’re here and are rendering aid to those on the ground. Send one to the rendezvous point too.”

“On the ground? Gord the entire continent was slagged.”

“There *are* survivors.” Gord said emphatically. “There was that whole city on the small continent, Palmerston. They have maybe six hours before they’re destroyed by debris from the attack.”

“Six hours might as well be six million hours Gord. How are we going to rescue them? We don’t have any landing craft.”

“We don’t need them. How much cargo space do you have free?”

“We don- er, about a million cubic meters, give or take.”

“That’ll be enough to hold a million people to get them to safety, even more if people squish up.”

“Gord, that’s *dangerously* crowded.”

“Better than being burned to death when the atmosphere roasts them.”

“Okay but you still haven’t said how we can get them.”

Gord swung the display in the command seat around to face him. Since it was just the two of them Cal did all the driving; Gord was along to observe and - according to him - be “stirring conversation.” When asked why he should be the one observing, Gord mentioned something offhandedly about being Canadian meant he knew what a war crime looked like better than anyone left alive. Now though, he was tapping on the console almost too fast to see, and then stood up from the seat and strode over to the wall in the back of command. “Cal” He said, touching the wall gently. “How much do you trust me?”

“You’re Gord.” Cal said. “You’re the best of us.”

“Ha.” Gord said quietly.  “Being the oldest doesn’t make you the best. I’ve done plenty that I’m not proud of. We can save Palmerston, but you have to trust me.”

Just then the radio crackled to life. “Neutral Observer Calgary’s Pride, this is Generalissimo Sharma, what’s this about a rescue operation? The continent is slagged! We have to concentrate on everyone in orbit before the Parvatians mount a followup attack.”

“Palmerston is on the other side of the planet, Victor. They’ve got hours before they’re destroyed. We’re going to get them.” Gord said as he worked the panels loose on the wall.

“Gord? Is that you? If anyone else had told me they were going to rescue Palmerston I’d have cracked them across the jaw them for wishful thinking, but you? Fine. Go then, I’ll coordinate rescue and escape here.”

“We’ve got some friends coming too, Victor. We’re taking everyone to Sol.”

“...Sharma out.”

“Gord.” Cal said quietly. “Can we really do it?”

“I wouldn’t try if I didn’t think there was some chance of success.”

“...What do you need me to do?”

Gord pulled panels off the wall in the back of command. “WEP your reactors, as high as they can go. We’re about to blow the energy budget. Evac the air too, it’ll make things easier.”

While the reactors spun up to speeds far beyond their rated levels, Gord could hear their whine quiet until the only way he knew they were still going was the buzzing in his feet. With all the atmosphere gone, everything was eerily silent. After removing two more panels, Gord found what he was looking for. Three levers, all about a meter long, all painted safety orange, dark and ruddy with age and dust. One at a time, he pulled the lever down, twisted the handle, and pushed it back up with a satisfying click he felt in his palms. 

“Woah Gord! What did you do?”

“You’ve got emergency landing protocols, I just threw the circuit breakers to activate them.”

“I do? How the fuck did you know?”

“Because this was *me*, centuries ago.” Gord’s smile was thin, sad. “I know we don’t talk about names, but long ago, when I wore this body, I was *City of Lethbridge*. One of the first true Starjumpers.”

“I’m in your body?”

“No!” Even over their internal connection, Cal felt Gord’s anger. “This why we don’t talk about this stuff. This ship, this shell ceased to be me when I moved to a new body. It’s not me anymore. It’s you Cal. I just happen to know something about your body.”

“Why do you know?”

“Because I designed it.” Gord made his way back to the command seat and while sitting, reached underneath and took out two wide black belts. Carefully bucking himself in he swung the screen back in front of him. “Back in those days we weren’t sure if we were going to be landing or not. You should be feeling those belly thrusters coming online, yeah?”

“I can, yeah. They’re bulky and they don’t feel that powerful though.”

“They’re nearly as old as I am, Cal. I’m not surprised. I’m going to calculate a link. We might pop a reactor though, so keep the capacitors charged. We’ll need at least one link to get to safety.”

“Okay Gord.” Cal sounded unsure. “Just what are we doing?”

“I told you,” Gord said as he executed the snippet of code he just injected, overwriting nearly all of Calgary’s Pride’s safeties. “We’re going to rescue a city.”

\*\*\*\*

Mayor Miles Hudson stood in the city square trying to calm the populace.

“People! We do not know what happened over in New Aukland. All communication lines have been cut. The sats are down, and the relays aren’t responding. They’re eight thousand kilometers away though. Anything that happened to them won’t happen to us.” He tried to sound reassuring, calm. The truth was Miles was rather worried. An hour ago, all communication with NA was cut suddenly, and what few reports people managed to get out didn’t make any sense. Explosions from deep in the planet? New volcanoes? Some kind of bombardment? The last one seemed the least likely to Miles, he got regular reports about the Parvatians and there hadn’t been any seen in the system for more than a week.

Before he could take questions, he and the entire crowd were knocked over by a massive shockwave. With a crack like thunder that kept going, Major Hudson looked down at the stark, sharp, white shadows at his feet and turning skyward saw something he thought was impossible. 

A Starjumper was falling through the atmosphere ass first, its stardrive firing a lance of white flame nearly as long as it was. He could barely look at the ship the exhaust was so bright, but it seemed to be in control. It seemed like it was aiming for the football pitch at the edge of the city.

“What the fuck is that, Mayor?” Eric Wilson, City Manager said, trying to stare as well. “It looks like a bloody Starjumper.”

“I think it is, Eric.” Miles stared as much as he could. “It’s not got Parvatian colors though, I don’t think it’s an assault.

“Is it related to whatever happened on the other side of the planet?”

“Probably Eric.” Miles hopped off the platform he had been standing on. “Let’s go meet them.”

Tearing across the city, they both saw throngs of people outside. Some were making their way towards the starjumper, thinking the same thing as Miles. Tensions had already been high with the regular Parvatian attacks, and now with the loss of comms and a bloomin *starjumper* landing, people were running around just to do something.

About a kilometer from the football pitch, they stopped the runabout. Miles didn’t know a lot about starjumpers, but he assumed that one should stay away from the hot bits, and after falling through the atmosphere it was probably all hot bits. When it was about one starjumper length off the ground, the stardrive cut, with a deafening silence. They could only watch in amazement as thrusters unfolded all over the ship and it spun gently until it was perpendicular to the ground and with a blast of thrusters and billowing clouds of dirt and dust it… landed.

Eric slapped the top of the runabout and Miles got back in. “Come on. We need to see what’s going on.” Eric said as they took off. 

The starjumper was *big*. 

It was one thing to know that a starjumper was between four and six kilometers long and originally used to travel relativistically between planets and so its size made sense. 

It was another thing entirely to stand on the ground looking up, and up at one as it steamed gently. Before he could start looking for a door, or a porthole, or an airlock, or whatever it had, gigantic hatches sprang open all along it, and there was a tremendous inrush of air. It had been completely in vacuum this entire time!

A PA crackled and a bright, if oddly accented voice said, “Hello there! This is the starjumper Calgary’s Pride and we’re here to rescue you! There’s been a… cataclysm on the other side of the planet and we only have a few hours before it reaches here. So yah, if everyone shoves up and makes room, we think we can fit everyone. It’ll be a squeeze but that’s better than the alternative, eh?”

“A cataclysm? What kind?” Miles said.

“A bad one. Who are you?” A man appeared to Miles’ right, startling him. He was about the same height, with sandy blond hair that was closely cropped, and he was wearing odd clothes.

“I’m the Mayor, Miles Hudson. Who are you?”

“I’m Gord. Me and Cal here are gonna scoop you up and get you somewhere safe. We’ve already overridden the local feeds to tell everyone to head to the pitch, but we could use your help to direct them, Mister Mayor.”

“Gord? What the hell-” Miles started to say before Eric elbowed him in his side, hard. 

“You got it Gord, we’re on it.”

“Glad to hear it.” Gord said. He looked at Miles and Eric oddly and then shook his head slightly. 

“What the fuck was that, Eric?” Miles said angrily after Gord walked away.

“That’s *Gord*, Miles. He’s the boss of the AIs.”

“They don’t have a boss.”

“Yeah, because *he* says they don’t need one. All the AIs do what Gord says.”

“And they’re going to rescue us? The whole bleedin city?”

“I reckon so, Miles.”

“Fuck me.” Miles said and looked at the starjumper, and then the crowd of people who had started to amass. “I suppose I had better get folks moving.”

“Uh, Calgary’s Pride?” Eric said after Miles strode off and started barking orders like he was the one who coordinated this rescue.

“Call me Cal. Who are you?”

“I’m Eric, the City Manager. Thanks for the rescue and everything, I truly appreciate it. But, how are we going to leave?”

“The usual way, Eric the City Manager. We’ll wormhole link back to Sol.”

“Yah yah, I assumed, but… how are you going to get out of atmo?”

“Out?” Cal said, and Eric could hear the smile in their voice. “Who says we’re getting out of atmo first? Wormhole links don’t care where we are.”

I’m very happy with it— I even use the internal grinder, and I’ve been able to make it work. I had replaced the inner burr once in its life, as it did wear out after a lot of uses. Recently, i’ve been having some issues dialing in my coffee. I have had to put the grind setting on 2 or 1, which tells me that the inner burr is either wearing out, or I need to adjust it down to a lower number. I decided to adjust the inner burr to a lower number, but I found that I still couldn’t dial in my beans very well. It seemed to either pull too fast or too slow, and it was somewhat in-between numbers with very little margin to play with. I’m not entirely sure I understand what’s going on. I don’t think the inner burr is worn out yet, and my beans are fresh. I’ve waisted almost an entire bag of coffee trying to dial this in, at which point I’m about to give up on this grinder. However, I’d like to understand what’s going on first before kicking it to the curb. Any ideas are welcome! Thanks to all.",1,1769697438.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False
