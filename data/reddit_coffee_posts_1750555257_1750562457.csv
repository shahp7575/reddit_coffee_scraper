1lhe4ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/1lhe4ov/couples_how_did_you_do_it/,Couples - How did you do it?,"My husband and I are going to see a dietician together finally! 

We're both shorties. He's been in denial about his unhealthy TV and eating habits until very recently, but we both have struggled to eat well over the years. 

Main issues for us: 
- Overeating due to boredom, stress, large portions
- Eating unhealthy options at coffee shops
- Thinking ""we deserve it"" as an excuse 
- Too much TV (doing a TV-free June now to reset)

We're each about 15lbs away from a ""healthy weight"", but more importantly we both need to reduce our body fat by about 10-15% and lower our cholesterol levels.

I'd love to hear from other couples who went through this. What did you struggle with before and during? How did you make lasting changes together? 🤗 ",1,1750562269.0,PetiteFitness,0,1.0,False
1lhe45w,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1lhe45w/my_coffee_bean_holy_grail_found_it_at_costco/,My Coffee Bean Holy Grail? Found it at... Costco?!,"
After years of chasing the perfect bean from indie roasters, and large brands alike, (and ending up with a cupboard full of expensive, disappointing coffee 30-40% of the time!), I've finally found my muse in the most unexpected place: Costco.

I usually stick to smaller batches from specialty roasters, or big bags from well known brands but decided to take a punt on their Kirkland Signature Colombian beans yesterday, and wow. Just wow.

I've always been impressed with Kirkland products, but these blew my expectations out of the water, especially at £12/kg!

 * Better crema than Lavazza Supercrema
 * Zero harshness
 * Incredible depth of flavor

This is just my humble opinion, but I'm so genuinely impressed I had to share.

Using a Sage Oracle Touch, for reference.

Rain greeted them.

 

Their contact—a woman in her forties named Aiko Suda, formerly with Tokyo PD—met them curbside. Her tone was respectful

 

“Ill drive you to Yokota air base” As they loaded into black vans, Vega looked out at the mist creeping over the high-rises.

 

“This place feels… sad.”

 

Martinez added, “Get ready, boys. We ain’t in Arizona anymore.”

Lou’s reflection flickered in the glass, eyes locked forward.

Something ancient was waiting.

And it wasn’t afraid of them.

 

Scene: Yokota Air Base – Officer Housing, Late Night

 

A cold rain tapped the windshield as the military van pulled past the gates of Yokota. Security gave a quick nod to Martinez—who returned it with a two-finger salute and a grin.

 

“I saved the CO from getting caught cheating on a PT test back in the day,” Martinez explained with a shrug. “Dude owes me his life. Or at least his house.”

The squad filed Into a spacious, well-maintained officer home tucked at the edge of the base. The walls were lined with old samurai artwork and baseball memorabilia. The place smelled like cedar and coffee.

Nolasco dropped his gear. “A whole-ass house? Damn, Top. Usually we get a broom closet and a cot in the janitor’s shed.” Gonzales wandered into the kitchen. “Yo, this guy has a rice cooker that talks.” Vega, looking through the sliding glass door, pointed to the mist creeping over the trees beyond the base fence. “Yeah, it talks all right. Probably curses you too.”

 

Lou walked the perimeter first. Windows. Doors. Lines of sight. His mind ticked like a metronome.

 

He stopped by a small Shinto shrine just outside the back gate.

A fox mask hung on the edge. He stared at it a moment. “Probably decorative,” Medina muttered. Lou didn’t answer. He kept walking.

 

 

 

Squad Living Room, Later That Night

 

The squad was sprawled out. Vega tuned the TV to an old Japanese wrestling channel. They watched in silence as a masked wrestler got body-slammed through a table.

Martinez leaned over to Jane, handing her a warm canned coffee from a vending stash. “Most haunted vending machines on Earth, I swear. Anyway welcome to Yokota. You ain’t in the doghouse here.”

 

Jane gave a slight smile. “Thanks.”

 

Martinez nodded, serious for once. “Ghosts or not—we’re still soldiers. Don’t forget that.”

 

She sipped, eyes flicking to Lou—still outside, standing in the rain. Looking at something  beyond the base walls.

 

 

 

Outside – Rain Drizzling, Lou Alone

 

Lou stood in the dark, breathing slow. He could feel something watching. Not hostile—just curious. Ancient. He muttered under his breath: “We’re here now. Whatever you are… we’ll see you soon.” Lightning cracked in the distance.

Looking for ghosts: 

 

Lou gathered his team in the meeting room ""I need each of you to travel to Tokyo for this mission,"" he began, ""Once you arrive, engage with the locals—strike up conversations in cafes, and visit markets, and . Your goal is to gather as much information as you can about any immediate threats that could affect us.""

 

He paused for a moment, making eye contact with each team member. ""Remember, the key to our success is to be authentic. Approach this mission as if you are part of the community—listen actively to the people you meet and learn from their experiences. Their insights may reveal  details that we can't uncover from a distance.""

 

Scene: Streets of Tokyo – Late Evening

 

The team spread out across the alley-strewn districts of Shinjuku and Koenji. The smell of grilled yakitori, diesel, and rain saturated the air. Neon lights buzzed above them, illuminating the night in colors that felt both alive and surreal.

 

Vega leaned against a rail while munching on a skewer. A group of Japanese college girls passed by, giggling and whispering behind their hands as they looked back at him.

 

“Kakkoii…” one of them murmured, her cheeks flushing red.

 

Vega looked around, confused. “That… was about me?”

 

A vendor nearby grinned. “They said you’re cool. You are… a handsome man!”

 

Vega laughed nervously. “Man, I’m married. I have three kids and a mortgage. You all have the wrong dude.”

 

\---

 

\*\*Nearby – Local Baseball Park\*\*

 

Gonzales was tossing a ball with a group of kids on a dimly lit diamond. Their laughter echoed through the alley walls. One of the boys tried to pitch a fastball to him—Gonzales cracked it into the net.

 

“Sugoi!” they shouted. Gonzales just smiled, sweat glinting on his forehead.

 

“You guys ever see the Cubs play?” he asked.

 

The kids all shook their heads.

 

“You will. One day,” he grinned.

 

\---

 

\*\*Meanwhile – A Quiet Shrine Alley\*\*

 

Lou and Jane had stumbled into a tucked-away alley near an old Buddhist shrine. Paper lanterns swayed above them. An elderly man sat on a bench nearby, a long pipe between his fingers, dressed in soft brown robes.

 

“You two don’t look like tourists,” he said in perfect English.

 

Lou gave a respectful nod. “We’re… looking for someone. Or something.”

 

The old man chuckled. “You’ll find more than what you came for. But tell me… are you seeking justice or escape?”

 

Jane tilted her head. “What’s the difference?”

 

“Intent,” the man replied, his eyes flicking to Lou. “Some hunt to punish. Others to understand. Only one path ends in peace.”

 

Lou listened intently. The old man’s gaze was steady and ancient. There was something behind his eyes that suggested he knew more than he let on.

 

Jane stood beside him silently, watching Lou absorb every word.

 

\---

 

\*\*Elsewhere – Behind a Shady Bar\*\*

 

Martinez stood beside two Yakuza men in sharp suits, their tattoos peeking out from under their sleeves. They smoked and sipped cheap whiskey behind a ramen shop.

 

“So,” Martinez said, “these ghost stories—what’s real?”

 

One of the men, his face half-covered by a dragon tattoo, exhaled smoke. “A woman with a slit mouth. She asks if you think she’s beautiful.”

 

The second added, “Wrong answer, and she’ll cut you to match. But she’s not just a ghost. She’s cursed. Angry.” Martinez scratched his chin. “I’ve pissed off worse. Appreciate the tip.” He paid for the men's drinks and shook their hands.

 

\---

 

\*\*Finally – Dark Alley Near Koenji Station\*\*

 

Medina wandered, following an odd whistle. It was melodic. Familiar?

 

A woman stepped from the shadows, wearing a red mask over her lower face.

 

“Kirei?” she asked in a voice like silk.

 

Medina froze.

 

“I asked… am I beautiful?”

 

She removed the mask, revealing a gruesome, Joker-like smile carved from ear to ear.

 

Medina reached for his weapon—

 

—but she vanished.

 

Only the faint sound of the wind and the distant hum of lanterns remained.

 

 

Cut to: Rooftop – Squad Reconnect Point

 

They regrouped as the moon rose. Lou had his arms crossed, thinking about the old man’s words.

 

Martinez lit a cigarette. “We’ve got our lead.”

 

Gonzales was still carrying a baseball glove.

 

Vega looked spooked. “The girls asked for my Instagram.”

 

Jane stood next to Lou, quieter now. Focused.

 

Medina? He just looked… shaken.

 

“Medina,” Lou asked. “You good?”

 

“…She smiled at me, man. Something’s coming.”

 

Lou’s jaw clenched. “Then we hit first.”

 

Scene: Yokota Safehouse – Briefing Room

 

A storm drummed lightly on the rooftop. Inside, the lights buzzed over the table as the squad gathered. A case file lay open at the center — yellowed police reports, grainy photos, and mythological notes printed on glossy pages.

 

Lou stood at the head of the table, arms crossed. His eyes scanned the room. Jane sat quietly, observing. Medina, though a little pale, rocked in his chair, chewing on a toothpick.

 

Vega muttered, “All this for one chick?”

 

Medina shot back, “You weren’t the one who saw her smile.”

 

Lou finally spoke. “Here’s what we know.”

 

He tapped the file.

 

 

 

Case File: Kuchisake-onna – “The Slit-Mouthed Woman”

 

Origin: Japanese urban legend dated back to the Heian period, though modern sightings began around the 1970s.

 

Description: Appears as a woman in a surgical or demon-style mask. She asks a single question: “Do you think I’m beautiful?”

 

Response Triggers:

 

If yes, she removes her mask and asks again. A wrong or hesitant answer results in her slashing the victim’s mouth to mimic her own.

 

If no, the result is usually immediate death.

 

Abilities: Supernatural speed. Possible teleportation or manipulation of perception. Victims are often found mutilated or vanish completely.

 

Weaknesses (Unconfirmed): Old folklore claims certain answers or candies (like hard caramel) distract her momentarily. Some theories suggest she is tethered to a trauma site.

 

Lou looked at Medina. “You sure it was her?”

 

Medina nodded. “Red coat, weird mask, voice like a hot anime villain, then boom—BAM!—full Glasgow grin.” He paused, shrugged. “Honestly? Kinda hot. I mean, not wife material, but… y’know. Unholy smash, maybe?”

 

Gonzales choked on his drink. “You’re cooked, bro.”

 

Martinez smirked. “Of all of us, she picks Medina.”

 

“Because I got riz,” Medina smirked. “And apparently a death wish.”

 

Vega raised a brow. “You gonna be alright?”

 

Medina shrugged. “I got freaked out, yeah. But I’ve been stalked before. Once by an ex. Once by an insurgent with no legs. I’ll live.”

 

Lou: “We’re thinking bait.”

 

Everyone turned.

 

Medina raised a hand. “Boom. Me.”

 

Jane leaned forward. “You’d use yourself to lure her?”

 

“Hell yeah. Masked girl with knife trauma? Sounds like my last Tinder date.”

 

Martinez chuckled. “Alright, Deadpool, don’t get sliced.”

 

Lou, still calm but firm, nodded. “We’ll control the area. Medina walks the same path, same time. We’ll set up around him. If she shows, we contain.”

 

Vega: “And if she doesn’t?”

 

Lou: “Then we keep trying. This thing’s smart. And watching. Let’s give her what she wants.”

 

 

 

Scene closes on Medina looking at a photo of her in the file — a blurry shot where only half her mutilated face is visible. He exhales and mutters, “You better take me to dinner first.”

 

Scene: Tokyo – Late Night Alleyway, Set for the Bait Mission

 

The alley was narrow, sickly yellow light bleeding down from a flickering streetlamp above. Damp brick walls rose on either side, tagging from generations of hands both living and lost. Everything was too quiet. Even the usual city hum was gone — like the block had been swallowed by something older.

 

Lou adjusted his earpiece from the rooftop. “Medina. You good?”

 

Medina: “Peachy. Might get murdered by a ghost in ten, but vibes are immaculate.”

 

Lou sighed. “Jane’s with you?”

 

Jane (over comms): “Affirmative. Just walking. No action. I promised.”

 

She and Medina strolled down the alley slowly, the silence broken only by their boots scuffing the pavement. Jane’s eyes darted constantly. Something in the shadows made her skin prickle — an instinct not quite human.

 

Jane (low): “The air… it’s thick. Like syrup.”

 

Medina didn’t reply. His eyes flicked toward the deeper dark ahead. Then, suddenly, Jane’s head turned.

 

Jane: “Did you hear that?”

 

She peered into the dim mouth of an intersecting alley. Nothing. Just crushed cans and a flickering vending machine.

 

But when she turned back to Medina…

 

Medina’s shirt was already off.

 

She didn’t say anything. Just blinked.

 

Jane (dryly): “…Are you allergic to fabric or something?”

 

Medina: “Look, statistically speaking, if I die tonight, I’m not going out in a tight tee. Plus, ghosts respect pecs.”

 

They continued. The dread crawled higher now — like something brushing just beneath the skin. Jane’s breath caught. Her eyes scanned corners and rooftops. There was a pressure, like they were in a submarine taking on water.

 

Then—she appeared.

 

At the far end of the alley, like she had always been there.

 

Kuchisake-onna.

 

Tall. Silent. Hair black as pitch and long like grief. A red coat buttoned tight, her face obscured by a medical mask stained faintly dark. Her hands hung at her sides, as if deciding which one would kill first.

 

She stepped forward.

 

The sound was wet. Like dragging something heavy.

 

Jane tensed but remembered the promise. She gritted her teeth.

 

Kuchisake-onna’s voice cut the air:

 

“Am I… beautiful?”

 

Time froze. Jane’s grip tightened slightly — not on a weapon, but on the decision to let it be.

 

Medina was supposed to run. That was the plan. He was supposed to sprint and draw her into the team’s kill zone.

 

But he didn’t move.

 

He just looked at her. Deadpan. Then grinned.

 

Medina: “Honestly? You’re kind of killing it, lady. Creepy-hot, mysterious, low-maintenance vibe? Ten outta ten. You’re the whole horror baddie package.”

 

Jane’s mouth fell open slightly. “…what?”

 

Kuchisake-onna’s head tilted slowly — a cracked, bird-like motion. She raised her hand toward her mask, fingers trembling.

 

But she froze. Her fingers stopped just short. Her arm twitched. Something in her glitched, like a corrupted image. Her head twitched the other way. Her hand dropped.

 

She just… stared at Medina.

 

A squint. A moment of genuine confusion. Not anger. Not hunger.

 

Perplexed.

 

Like a woman wondering if a guy at the bar really just called her cursed scars “aesthetic.”

 

She blinked.

 

Then turned.

 

And walked away.

 

No fade. No vanish. Just…walked. Like she didn’t want to deal with whatever that was.

 

As she passed through the mist further down, she glanced back once.

 

Straight at Medina.

 

Her stare wasn’t hateful.

 

It was confused.

 

Almost offended.

 

Jane, still stunned, finally spoke: “You cracked her programming…”

 

Medina shrugged, sliding his shirt back on. “Sometimes, you gotta out-weird the paranormal.”

 

Lou (over comms): “…what the hell just happened?”

 

Jane: “She didn’t attack.”

 

Medina (smirking): “Guess she wasn’t ready for this much man.”

 

The alley stayed quiet as the squad began to regroup, but something had shifted — not just in the mission, but in the curse. In her.

 

A hairline fracture In something ancient.

 

Something might’ve started to break

 

Scene: Tokyo – Late Night Alleyway, Set for the Bait Mission

 

Scene: Quiet Street Outside a Vending Machine – Late Evening

 

Medina stood alone, sipping canned coffee under a flickering lamplight. The vending machine buzzed softly behind him. The air was calm, no supernatural chill, no dread creeping into his spine. Just the faint smell of asphalt and sakura leaves carried by a spring breeze.

 

Then… she was just there.

 

No whisper. No footsteps. No dread chord in the air.

 

The Slit-Mouthed Woman stood a few feet away, mask on, her hair cascading over her pale shoulders like silk soaked in shadow.

 

Medina blinked.

 

No flinch. No hand to his weapon. He just stared at her like someone who’d bumped into an old coworker at a grocery store.

 

She tilted her head. Eyes narrowed, not in anger — but in genuine confusion.

 

Slit-Mouthed Woman: “Why… did you say that?”

 

A pause.

 

Medina scratched his head.

 

Medina: “Thought I was gonna die. So, I figured… screw it. If I go out, I’m going out weird.”

 

She blinked. Processing that.

 

Then slowly raised a pale hand and touched her mask.

 

She hesitated… then lowered it just enough to reveal her disfigured mouth again — torn lips, carved cheeks. But something was off. The twisted smile wasn’t as raw… the flesh not as gray. It looked faintly… pink. Like blood had returned to her skin for the first time in centuries.

 

Her eyes met his again.

 

Slit-Mouthed Woman: “What does… ten out of ten… mean?”

 

Medina was quiet for a second.

 

Then he smirked.

 

Medina: “It means… you were the prettiest thing I’d ever seen.”

 

A long, long silence. Her expression didn’t shift much, but something behind those haunted eyes flickered — like a wall being questioned.

 

Then, she turned.

 

She didn’t vanish in smoke or screams.

 

She just walked away, long hair swaying, bare feet silent on the street.

 

Before disappearing around the corner, she glanced back.

 

No malice.

 

Just confusion… and a sliver of something human.

 

 

 

Scene: Safehouse, Later That Night

 

The squad sat around the kitchen table. A ramen pot bubbled on the stovetop. Medina sipped from a beer can, unusually quiet.

 

Martinez: “Alright, Candy Man. What now?”

 

Medina (still distant): “She showed up again. No threat. No aura. Just… there.”

 

Nolasco: “And?”

 

Medina: “She asked why I said what I said. I told her. Then she asked what ‘ten out of ten’ meant.”

 

Vega (raising an eyebrow): “What the hell?”

 

Gonzales: “You teachin’ English to yokai now?”

 

Jane leaned in, eyes sharp but intrigued.

 

Jane: “Wait. She wanted to understand something?”

 

Medina nodded.

 

Medina: “She looked more… human. Less corpse, more… I dunno. Sad girl on the street.”

 

A heavy silence filled the room.

 

Then Lou spoke up, voice low.

 

Lou: “That wasn’t just psychological warfare. You disrupted the curse logic. Her whole existence is based on a strict, horrific loop — ask the question, punish the answer. You gave her… something new.”

 

Medina: “A compliment?”

 

Lou (nodding): “Maybe. Or maybe… empathy. You jammed a humanity-shaped wrench in the gears.”

 

Jane (softly): “So… her curse feeds off fear and ritual. But you gave her choice.”

 

Gonzales: “Like a haunted record skipping ‘cause you played jazz over it.”

 

Lou stood, pacing slightly now, deep in thought.

 

Lou: “This changes things. We’ve been going in treating them like monsters. Hit lists. Traps. Kill zones. But what if some of these spirits… can be reasoned with? Not all. But some.”

 

Vega: “You wanna give therapy to demons now?”

 

Lou: “No. But I wanna understand what binds them. Break the curse, not just the creature.”

 

The squad sat with that for a beat.

 

Medina looked at his now-cold coffee. Then grinned.

 

Medina: “So what you’re saying is… I ghost busted a yokai with flirtation.”

 

Martinez (flat): “Don’t push it.”

 

Nolasco: “You’re never gonna live this down.”

 

Jane, staring at her drink, half-laughing, half-stunned: “You told a centuries-old spirit she was a ten… and she’s rethinking her life.”

 

Lou (quietly, almost to himself): “We adapt. We rethink. Not just how we kill… but how we save.”

 

 

Scene: Safehouse – Yokota Base – Tactical Briefing Room

 

The 13th Psalm squad sits around a small table littered with case files, printed maps, and energy drinks. A laptop connected to a projector flick through slides as Lou presents the newest mission dossier.

 

Lou (voice cold, focused):

“Target: Saeki residence, Nerima ward. Classified as an ultra-high threat spiritual entity. Based on what we know, we’re dealing with a grudge — a curse born of murder, pain, and hatred so powerful it spreads like an infection.”

 

The projector clicks.

A photo of the unassuming house appears: two stories, gray walls, overgrown weeds, all silent. It looks innocent. But everyone feels the weight in the room.

 

Jane (arms crossed):

“Looks like the set from The Grudge. I’m guessing that’s not a coincidence?”

 

Lou:

“It’s not. The movie franchise? Based on this house. Loosely. Some creative liberties have been taken but the foundation is real. The production crew visited the location in the early 2000s. Only a few people walked inside. Most of them died within six months. No one returned.”

 

Medina (sipping coffee):

“So we’re fighting a reboot?”

 

Martinez (flat):

“We’re walking into a meat grinder that inspired a horror franchise. Respect the source.”

 

Gonzales:

“What’s the curse spread like?”

 

Lou clicks to the next slide. A diagram of known victims — red string webbing from one person to the next.

 

Lou:

“It’s viral. The moment you enter the house, you’re marked. Doesn’t matter what you believe. Doesn’t matter who you are. You’ve been seen. And once you're marked…”

 

Vega (grim):

“…she comes for you.”

 

Gonzales:

“It’s not just her, right? The kid. Toshio. And the cat.”

 

Lou:

“Correct. Toshio was their son. Kayako’s son. Witnessed everything. His spirit is part of the curse. So is their cat, Mar. Everything that died that night is bound together. That’s what makes it so dangerous.”

 

Nolasco (arms crossed):

“Run us through it. What the hell actually happened in that house?”

 

Lou switches to an old police file. Photos show a woman’s corpse, her neck snapped. Scribbled notes reference obsession, domestic homicide, and ritual suicide.

 

 

 

Lou:

“Kayako Saeki. Mid-30s. Obsessive journal entries about a professor named Kobayashi. Her husband, Takeo, found them. Convinced she was having an affair, he murdered her by snapping her neck and shoving her body into the attic. Then drowned their son, Toshio, in the bathtub… and killed the cat for good measure.”

 

Vega:

“Dude went full psycho.”

 

Lou:

“He hanged himself afterward. But that moment — all the rage, all the trauma — created something. A stain on the world. That house became a breeding ground for spiritual decay. Anyone who enters… dies. Then the curse moves through them, like a virus.”

 

Martinez (staring at the house photo):

“Can’t punch that.”

 

Medina:

“And even if we burn the house down?”

 

Lou:

“It’s been burned before. Still stands. No scorch marks. Like time doesn’t apply.”

 

Nolasco:

“Then how the hell do we kill it?”

 

Lou (after a long pause):

“We don’t know yet. That’s the problem. Even the Vatican issued a red-tier containment rating. Everyone who’s ever tried to confront it head-on has failed.”

 

Gonzales (quietly):

“Marked means one of us might not make it back.”

 

A heavy silence.

 

Jane breaks it.

 

Jane:

“Maybe this isn’t about killing it. Maybe… it’s about breaking the moment that caused it.”

 

Vega:

“You mean… time travel?”

 

Martinez:

“Like therapy again? Worked for freakin’ caramel-boy over there.”

 

Medina:

“Hey. That’s Dr. Caramel now.”

 

A few chuckles. Tension breaks briefly — but the weight returns.

 

Lou (looking at the house photo):

“We don’t walk into this one half-cocked. We gather every lead, every file. We’re going to need a plan that doesn’t rely on brute force or bullets.”

 

Martinez:

“I’ll contact people. They might know priest on the area

 

Lou:

“Good. And no one enters that house. Not until we have something solid. We’re not losing anyone to this one. Not like this.”

 

The screen fades to black.

 

 

Psalm 13: The Kayako Investigation

 

Entry: The Quiet Before the Curse

 

 

 

\[Found in the 13th Psalm Black Files — Case 392: “Saeki House”\]

Compiled from audio logs, journal fragments, and an incident report.

 

 

 

\[Jane’s Journal – Handwritten Entry\]

“They warned me not to go. Told me the priest would refuse to speak. But he didn’t. He just asked if I’d dreamed of a woman with her head twisted like a corkscrew. When I said yes, he let me in.”

 

 

 

Jane’s path took her deep into the folds of Osaka’s older districts, where the streets still hold the memory of old blood and older ghosts. The priest she met didn’t live in a church, but a weather-beaten ryokan converted into a private shrine. His face was lined with age and fear. Not wisdom — fear.

 

“The woman you seek,” he said, “wasn’t killed. She was unmade. The moment she realized her husband no longer saw her as human, she unraveled. Spirit, flesh, soul — all became one curse. You cannot exorcise her. You can only understand her… and pray she understands you.”

 

 

 

He gave Jane a small Ofuda, a talisman soaked in sake and sealed in wax. She didn’t know what to do with it, so she kept it close — pocketed it like a confession.

 

 

 

\[Martinez – Bodycam Transcript\]

Location: Bar in Nerima District. Time: 2200.

 

Martinez leaned on the bar, sipping a warm beer, speaking to a local in half-spoken Japanese and all-charisma.

 

“The house? People don’t even look at it. Mailmen drop letters five houses down and say a prayer. Cops won’t respond to domestic calls there. The dogs won’t bark. You know what that means? Even animals know better.”

 

 

 

The man next to him said he lost a cousin who went urban exploring in 2009. He found him a week later, slumped in his bathroom with his face twisted into a silent scream. Martinez lit a cigarette, thanked him, and left.

 

 

 

\[Medina’s Research Notes – Tokyo National Library\]

 

“Noticed recurring glyphs in the pages of Takeo Saeki’s old art books. Scribbled between margins. Always the same shape. Like a spiral. Looks like something ancient. Might be linked to Yamato-era burial rituals — the way the soul is sealed by emotion.”

 

 

 

Medina left the library at midnight. When he closed the book, the spine let out a sound like a sigh.

 

 

 

\[Gonzales and Vega – Audio Recording, Unofficial Interrogation\]

Location: Nerima Hospital, psychiatric ward.

 

They visited Rei Hoshino, a former childhood friend of Toshio. She hadn’t spoken in ten years. But when they mentioned the name “Kayako,” she blinked — then started humming.

 

It was a lullaby.

 

Gonzales leaned in:

 

“Did something happen in that house, when you were a kid?”

 

 

 

She whispered:

 

“She never blinks.”

 

 

 

 

 

\[Lou – Unlogged, Unrecorded Entry – Location: Saeki Residence, 0400 Hours\]

 

Lou stood in front of the house.

 

No squad. No lights. Just wind scraping dead leaves across concrete. He’d been there for four hours. Watching. Thinking. Trying to imagine what the curse wanted.

 

He had one thought. One instinct.

 

“Fuck it.”

 

He walked forward. The door opened on its own.

 

 

Entry: THE MARKING

 

 

 

The house breathed.

 

That’s the only way Lou could describe it.

 

Every step on the dusty floorboards gave off a sound that didn’t match his weight. It echoed too long. He passed by a shoe rack with small child-sized slippers, perfectly aligned. A moldy portrait of a woman with her eyes scratched out. A hallway that seemed longer than it should be.

 

And then…

The creaking started.

 

The sound of something pulling itself along the ceiling, slow and deliberate. Lou drew his weapon, but it felt like trying to bring a gun to a drowning.

 

SKKKRRRRRAAAAAAAAAK.

 

 

 

The sound of fingernails on wood — but it came from above.

 

Lou raised his eyes.

 

Kayako was crawling upside-down along the ceiling beam.

 

Neck broken. Eyes wide. Mouth agape in an endless croak that didn’t end with sound, but with intent. A jagged, stuttering breath rattled her frame. Her body moved in jerks — not puppet-like, but as if physics forgot how to apply to her.

 

She stared at him, then disappeared.

 

No noise. Just gone.

 

That was when he felt it.

 

A pressure in his chest. Like his heartbeat suddenly didn’t belong to him. Like something else was watching from inside.

 

His breathing slowed. The hallway elongated. Doors stretched tall like monoliths. Whispers without a source drifted behind the walls.

 

A child’s voice.

 

Lou turned to see Toshio, pale and unmoving, crouched at the end of the hallway.

 

 

Lou, trying to keep control of his thoughts, muttered,

 

“Toshio.”

 

 

 

Toshio stared. Then vanished.

 

The house snapped back to normal.

 

Lou collapsed to his knees. Sweat dripping. But his mind — still intact.

 

Barely.

 

 

 

Outside, hours later:

 

The squad rushed in when Lou exited the house, drenched in sweat, eyes bloodshot but defiant.

 

Jane:

 

“What the hell did you do?!”

 

 

 

Lou (calmly):

 

“I invited the curse in.”

 

 

 

Medina:

 

“You’re marked, man. That’s suicide.”

 

 

 

Lou:

 

“No. It’s intel.”

 

 

 

He turned to Jane, breathing hard.

 

Nobody in her situation asked to be cursed like this. I need to determined the origin of this thing.

 

Martinez:

 

“Or this “thing” eats your soul while we watch.”

 

 

 

Lou:

 

“Then we’ll find another way to gather intel.”

 

 

 

 

 

Psalm 13: The Hauntings of Lou Phillips

 

Entry: The Spiral Deepens

 

 

 

\[Case File 392-A Addendum – Internal Memo, Medina to Martinez\]

“He’s not sleeping anymore. Keeps the lights off. Won’t talk. Whatever’s happening to him… it’s not just mental. The air around Lou feels wrong now. Cold, like it’s hiding something.”

 

 

 

NIGHT ONE

 

They found him sitting up at 2:43 AM, staring at the front door.

 

Gonzales said he’d heard Lou talking to someone. Thought he was on comms.

Only… there was no comms.

 

They asked him who he was talking to.

 

Lou just said,

 

“She’s trying to show me something. I don’t think I want to know what it is.”

 

 

That night, the bathtub filled on its own. Martinez went to turn it off, thinking someone was wasting water. When he reached the edge, he saw hair in the drain. Black, long, knotted. Still dripping, even though the faucet was dry.

 

Something exhaled behind him.

 

He didn’t turn around. He just walked out.

 

NIGHT TWO

 

Lou walked into the hallway of the safehouse at 3:12 AM. Jane followed — said she was worried. He stood there for twenty minutes, not blinking, not moving. Then he turned and whispered:

 

“He was on the ceiling.”

 

She asked who.

 

He didn’t answer.

 

Later, the squad found claw marks on the hallway ceiling — fresh, wet. Wood splinters scattered like fingernail shavings.

 

 

 

NIGHT THREE

 

Vega was monitoring infrared. Saw a thermal signature near Lou’s room.

 

“Looked like a kid. 4 feet tall. Crouched. Watching him sleep.”

 

 

 

When they opened the door, there was no one there. But Lou was wide awake.

 

“He’s not sleeping,” Jane whispered.

 

 

 

NIGHT FOUR

 

They heard Lou screaming.

 

Not yelling. Not shouting.

 

Screaming.

 

They broke into the room and found it empty — save for the mirror. The entire mirror had a handprint on it. But not just any handprint.

 

It had five fingers… and a thumbprint on the opposite side, like someone’s hand had wrapped around Lou’s head.

 

That was the first time Jane cried.

 

 

 

THE FINAL HAUNTING

 

 

 

Lou hadn’t spoken in two days. Not even to Jane.

 

He sat alone, in a pitch-black room, staring into a tall mirror. No weapons. No armor. Just his dog tags and the cross he always wore around his neck.

 

Drip… drip…

 

The sound of water. There were no pipes in the room.

 

He looked up.

 

Kayako was behind him.

 

Neck crooked, body twitching like broken marionette strings. Her hair slithered across the floor like it had a life of its own. That rattle — the death rattle — grew louder.

 

But Lou didn’t move. He stared into the mirror.

 

And the reflection changed.

 

It was Jeff.

Smiling.

Lips cracked. Eyes sunken. That terrible, mocking expression — pure sadism frozen in time.

 

Lou’s jaw clenched.

 

He didn’t blink.

 

Lou knew she was there but he didn’t look at her

 

Kayako looked into the mirror too… and froze.

 

She saw it.

 

She saw Jeff.

 

Her head tilted like a curious dog. Confusion ,Fear?

 

She reached out slowly. Put her hand on Lou’s head — almost gently.

 

Then her grip tightened. Violent.

She slammed his head into the mirrorly

 

Glass shattered — but Lou didn’t black out.

 

Instead… he saw.

 

 

 

THE VISIONS

 

 

 

The crawlspace of the Saeki house.

Kayako curled in a corner, writing in her journal. The words melt, smear, drip like wet ink.

Footsteps.

Takeo’s voice:

 

“You’re not even a woman anymore.”

 

 

 

The scream as he snaps her neck — it echoes forever.

 

She’s dragged. Broken. Left to rot with her son watching. He dies next. Soaked in red. The rage loops into eternity. The curse is born.

 

 

 

Then it shifts.

 

Afghanistan.

A concrete compound.

Women with black eyes and bruised arms whisper behind mesh veils. One looks at Lou. Her lips move.

 

“Why didn’t you help?”

 

 

 

Lou remembers.

 

He wasn’t allowed to intervene.

Command said it would “complicate relations.”

 

Then the woman’s face starts bubbling. Melting.

 

Her mouth opens like Kayako’s — a gaping black void.

 

Another woman. Another wife. Beaten. Crying.

 

Her face transforms too.

 

And another.

 

And another.

 

Each time:

Kayako.

 

 

 

Lou drops to his knees. Eyes bloodshot. His breath shaking.

 

In his mind:

 

“You saw it too. That’s why she chose you.”

 

 

 

 

 

AFTERMATH

 

They found him catatonic for four hours.

 

When he finally stood, his knuckles were bleeding. The mirror was in pieces.

 

Jane held him. She tried to speak — but he just shook his head.

 

Then he looked at the squad.

 

“She’s not just a curse. She’s grief, rage, betrayal. She’s a wound that never closes.”

 

 

 

Medina:

 

“You saw the source?”

 

 

 

Lou:

 

“I lived it.”

 

 

 

Jane:

 

“You’re not the same.”

THE BRIEFING

 

They were all sitting around Lou in the motel room. He hadn’t slept. He hadn’t eaten. Still, when he spoke, his voice had the kind of weight that couldn’t be ignored — like a sermon at a funeral.

 

Lou (quiet):

 

“I’m going back.”

 

 

 

The room went dead silent.

 

Gonzales:

 

“Back? Back where? Hell no, man.”

 

 

 

Vega:

 

“That house is a graveyard. And not a normal one.”

 

 

 

Nolasco:

 

“She tried to kill you, bro. I saw what was on your face. You’re tellin’ us you want more of that?”

 

 

 

Lou nodded once.

 

Lou:

 

“I saw something. She’s stuck in a loop. A wound. We’ve seen what happens when a ghost is angry. But what happens when it’s afraid?”

 

 

 

Medina:

 

“So what? You’re gonna walk into that house and ask her to cry it out with you?”

 

 

 

Lou (firm):

 

“I’m going to confront what she can’t.”

 

 

 

The room shifted. Martinez finally broke the silence.

 

Martinez:

 

“…We’ll be outside. Running overwatch. If you’re wrong, we pull you out. No argument.”

 

 

 

Lou (nods):

 

“Understood.”

 

 

 

 

 

LATER THAT NIGHT

 

LOCATION: Temporary Op Van, 2 blocks from the Saeki Residence

TIME: 0216 hours

 

Medina sat in the van. Alone. Watching the feed flicker. Then…

 

Footsteps behind him.

 

He turned.

 

There she was. The Slit-Mouthed Woman.

 

But… something had changed. Her mouth still hung open in that terrible Glasgow smile — but her eyes weren’t the same. They were human. Sad. Fearful.

 

She sat beside him, not moving, barely existing, like mist that had chosen to stay.

 

Medina (whispers):

 

“What do you want?”

 

 

 

She didn’t answer.

 

Her head turned slowly to the drone feed. Lou. Alone. Walking toward the house.

 

Medina:

 

“You’re afraid of him, too.”

 

 

 

No denial. Just silence.

 

Medina (soft):

 

“He’s been through more hell than most people could survive. Lost his parents. Brother tried to kill him. Watched women get beaten overseas and couldn’t stop it. Buried too many friends. He never got soft. Never turned bitter. Just kept fighting.”

 

 

 

The Slit-Mouthed Woman tilted her head.

 

Medina:

 

“I think… I think he took on this curse on purpose. Not to kill it. To carry it.”

 

 

 

She flickered — a twitch of emotion — like she wanted to say something but couldn’t.

1lhe177,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alibaba/comments/1lhe177/freight_forwarder_classic_scam_alert/,Freight Forwarder classic scam alert,"Hi everyone,

I recently purchased a large quantity of custom-printed coffee cups under my own brand. The supplier has been fantastic — responsive, professional, and easy to work with. However, they do not offer DDP shipping, so I had to arrange my own freight forwarding.

Once production was complete, the goods were handed over to **Shenzhen Yiluyouni International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd.** Initially, they quoted me $1.05/kg for sea freight, which is a little more expensive than some offers on Freightos. My Chinese friend has confirmed they are legal company, with 11 years of experience in exporting; plus their Alibaba store has been operating for 2 years, which is kinda rare for a forwarder, and 37 good reviews. In general, they look legit, I have searched and could not find any bad reviews about them on any forums. My billed weight is 2,500 kg, though the actual volumetric weight provided by my supplier is closer to 1800-2,000 kg. I understand some variation due to deformation during packaging is expected, but a 20–25% increase in volume seems excessive.

After receiving the goods, the forwarder suddenly revised the cost to $4,500 USD, which is nearly double the initial quote. They are also insisting on payment via bank transfer or cash, refusing to create an order on Alibaba — which leaves me with no buyer protection.

Notably, before they received my shipment, their communication was incredibly fast, almost too eager. Now that they have the goods in hand, they respond once a day at most and act as if they’re busy like a president.

At this point, I’m considering abandoning the shipment entirely. The total value of the goods is around $3,500 USD, and I have another supplier willing to reproduce the full order and ship under DDP for $5,000 USD. I’d rather spend more with someone reliable than let this current forwarder continue wasting my time. Plus, they can't profit from my branded cups — these aren't blank white coffee cups; they’re customized with my logo, so resale isn’t feasible as no one would want to buy them in bulk at a high price than myself.

I’ve bought and shipped multiple times through Alibaba and even Taobao without any issues — until now. This is the first time I’ve run into something like this, and it’s been a frustrating and eye-opening experience. I’ve learned my lesson the hard way. I take full responsibility for trusting them, and I’ve paid the price. I’m only sharing this now to warn others so they don’t fall into the same company.

If you’re ever considering working with Shenzhen Yiluyouni International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd., my advice is simple: Stay far away.

Thanks for reading — and I hope this helps someone avoid what I’ve gone through.

1lhe0n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1lhe0n0/grandma_gets_intense_about_breakfast/,Grandma gets intense about breakfast.,"So this happened a good while ago when I was still in High School. Every so often my grandmother would come to visit from another state and just take up residence with me and my mom for however long she decided to stay. No warning, just show up with some bags and let us know she was here to help. My mom worked for a hospital chain and was pretty well traveled and often I was left to fend for myself for a day or two which was not a big deal I was 16 at the time and my dad lived maybe 20 minutes away, but if grandma found out mom was going to be gone she would immediately appear to “watch the house and chaperone.” So it’s one of those times my mom is gone and it’s just me and grandma and I was a little extra put out by the intrusion in my house. Earlier that month one of my family members had found out I had come out and they proceeded to share this news with several other relatives who had no business knowing my business. My grandma was very very religious and I didn’t know for sure if she has heard anything. So one morning I am in the kitchen trying to figure out what I want for breakfast and grandma walks in and asks what I’m doing. I said “Trying to decide if I want cereal or just coffee.” Grandma suddenly gives me a very serious look and says “Some people find a cereal that is right for them and they have it every day faithfully for the rest of their lives. Some people struggle to find a cereal that is to their taste and they start to think they don’t like cereal at all. When really they just need to go out and try different kinds of cereals until they find the one cereal they are happy with for the rest of their lives. It’s just really important to not just give up on cereal all together.” And then she just walked away and never mentioned it again. ",1,1750561886.0,story,0,1.0,False
1lhdzkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Machupicchu/comments/1lhdzkb/9_days_in_peru_report/,9 Days In Peru Report,"This community was such a helpful resource to me while planning my solo trip, so hoping that my experience can provide insight for somebody else as well.

Some details about me:

* I'm a young female. For the most part I felt safe traveling the country myself (and met quite a few fellow solo female travelers along the way!)
* I was in Peru for 9 days/8 nights in early-mid June. The weather mostly aligned with Peru's dry season, but I did get one day of snow (see below!)
* I consider myself a budget traveler, trying as much as possible to save money where I can. However I did spend a good amount on booking a 2-day Inca Trail hike with a tour group. This was mainly because Machu Picchu tickets were sold out for my trip window and so I wouldn't have to handle all the logistics of getting there. The tour was successful in that regard.
* I thankfully didn't suffer much from altitude sickness. Don't know whether it was my approach (starting in Ollantaytambo rather than Cusco and taking it *very* slow in the beginning) or just the way my body works, but I was able to get through all my planned itineraries without being derailed. I brought Diamox with me and tested it in Lima, but didn't like the side effects (intense numbing over legs, arms, face). So I decided not to use it and basically rawdogged the entire trip
* I flew with LATAM and Sky Airlines and didn't have issues at any point with my carry-on luggage (I was pretty concerned about the size)

Day 1: Lima

* Had a redeye flight into Lima and a 6am flight to Cusco the next day so unfortunately couldn't spend much time here
* Took the Airport Express bus (\~$5 USD) to Miraflores, where I stayed. The stand is easy to find once you exit through the baggage claim and head outside toward the parking lots
* Visited:
   * Kennedy Park
   * La Lucha Sangucheria Criolla
   * Picarones Mary (beware the bees!)
   * Parque del Amor

Day 2: Cusco -> Ollantaytambo

* Booked Taxidatum ($7) for my early morning drive to the airport
* Once in Cusco, I made use of my Inca Trail tour company's airport pickup service (included in tour price) to get me to Calle Pavitos. From there, I boarded a colectivo to Ollantaytambo (15 soles) to start my acclimatization at a lower altitude
* I took it VERY slow and purposefully didn't schedule much this day so as to help my body adjust
* Visited:
   * Plaza de Armas
   * Casa de Cuyes
      * One of the highlights of my trip! Highly recommend if you're a guinea pig lover. Be sure to bring a tip

Day 3: Explore the Sacred Valley

* I asked my hotel front desk for a driver to take me to Moray, Maras, then back to Ollantaytambo. Negotiated the price down to 120 soles. It was a private taxi, and the driver waited for me for however long I wanted at each stop (although I tried to keep it around 30 min per stop which is standard). He took a scenic ""shortcut"" route up the mountains, which was absolutely breathtaking!!
* Visited:
   * Moray (70 soles in cash for Boleto Turístico Parcial Circuito III, valid for two consecutive days)
   * Salineras de Maras (20 soles cash for foreigners)
   * Had a good local lunch at Restaurante ""Doña Eva"" for 10 soles
   * Ollantaytambo Ruins (included in Boleto Turístico)

Day 4: Ollantaytambo -> Pisac -> Cusco

* Took a colectivo from Ollantaytambo -> Urubamba (a few soles)
* At Urubamba, transferred to a colectivo to Pisac (a few soles)
   * The first colectivo dropoff was a \~20 minute walk from the pickup to Pisac, and it wasn't super pleasant esp with my luggage. If I were to do this route again I'd ask the first driver if he'd drive me directly to the second pickup spot for 1-2 more soles
* Visited:
   * Ulrike's Tortas Y Mas Pisac: such a lovely family-run cafe with great carrot cake. They also allowed me to store my luggage there for the day while I toured the town
   * Mercado de artesanías and Nuevo Mercado Artesanal
   * Pisac Archeological Park (included in Boleto Turístico)
      * I took a taxi for 30 soles up to the top of the ruins and hiked for 2 hours back down to the town. This was easily the most stunning hike I went on but also super challenging. It's straight downhill so hard on the knees, and included many winding paths carved right into the mountainside, without handrails, and steep cliff dropoffs to the side. Wouldn't recommend if you're afraid of heights
* Took another colectivo from Pisac to Cusco (5 soles)

Day 5: Full day in Cusco

* Visited:
   * Mercado de San Blas
   * Three Monkeys Coffee
   * Plaza de Armas
      * Parades and festivities!
   * Had dinner at a local menú joint for 6 soles, Samaritano
* I had booked a free walking tour with Inkan Milky Way Cusco but ended up being the only person who showed up, so it was canceled

Day 6: Inca Trail Day 1

* I booked with Sam Travel Peru. Coordinated all logistics from Cusco -> Ollantaytambo -> start of hike
* Visited:
   * Wiñay Wayna: these ruins were absolutely stunning!! Would highly recommend seeing, but I believe you only can through doing the Inca Trail
   * Sun Gate
   * Machu Picchu route 1a with classic postcard view

Day 7: Inca Trail Day 2

* This was basically just a guided tour of Machu Picchu Circuit 3, \~3 hours
* Group return to Cusco

Day 8: Rainbow Mountain

* I booked an early morning tour through GetYourGuide with tour operator Chullos Travel.  I didn't hear from them until I reached out myself over Whatsapp the day before. They also flubbed my pickup location (said they would pick me up at my hotel but changed it to a plaza like 30 minutes before the time). The tour included transport up to the mountain and back, breakfast, lunch, but not the 30 soles cash entry fee.
* It snowed! The weather up there is expectedly unpredictable, so if you get precipitation you may not be able to see the colors clearly. But it was a worthwhile journey nonetheless.

Day 9: Cusco -> Lima -> Home

Tips:

* Most places prefer payment by cash. They might have the option to pay by card but will add a 5% extra fee. So always carry enough soles
* You can take out soles without fees by using Banco de la Nación ATMs. There were a ton in Lima and Cusco, but not in the smaller cities, so plan accordingly. You can withdraw max 400 soles in one transaction
* For Rainbow Mountain, if you're not fit to climb, I'd recommend bringing 80-100 soles in cash for a horse each way. There are plenty of opportunities to catch one along the hike
* Colectivos are a very doable, cheap way to get around, esp in the Sacred Valley. Make sure to bring coins and also consult Google Maps to find each pickup spot

1lhdz9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhdz9c/i_helped_my_ex_cheat_on_my_toxic_exbest_friend/,I helped my ex cheat on my toxic ex-best friend and I don’t feel guilty at all,"Hi Reddit. Throwaway because some people know my main.

TL;DR: Dated my high school sweetheart for years, broke up before college so I wouldn’t do long distance. While I was gone, my toxic best friend “comforted” him and they started dating. Years later, I moved back, we reconnected, realized we still loved each other, and he left her for me. I know I helped him cheat — but I don’t regret it one bit. I got my soulmate back and lost a fake friend.

I (24F) dated Tom (fake name, 24M) all through high school, from freshman year until the summer before college. We weren’t “never fight” perfect, but we were *good* perfect — supportive, honest, and genuinely in love.

My “best friend” Kayla (fake name, 23F) and I had been friends since 3rd grade. Looking back, she was incredibly toxic — manipulative, controlling — but I was scared of losing my friend group if I cut her off.

When it was time for college, I moved out of state and broke up with Tom. I told him I loved him and always would, but I knew long-distance would break me. We cried for hours. He respected it, but it wrecked us both.

While I was gone (getting my Bachelor’s in Biology and Criminal Justice), Tom stayed home and got his MBA. He fell into a depression after I left — and of all people, Kayla swooped in to “help.” They ended up dating.

Fast forward: I move back home 4 years later, get a job as a forensic analyst ($74k/year), and Tom’s business absolutely takes off — from 2 employees to nearly 100 in 4 years.

A year after moving back home, I run into him while grocery shopping. We were both so happy to see each other that we agreed to get coffee. Three days later, at that coffee date, he drops, *“Oh, by the way, I’m dating Kayla.”*

I was stunned. He used to hate Kayla — he always told me she used me and treated me like crap. I asked how it happened. He said, *“I was struggling after we broke up, she was there, we bonded… and we’ve been together about 5 years.”*

I asked if they were serious — he shrugged: *“Yeah, I guess you could say that. We don’t live together or anything.”*

I asked if he saw a future with her — another shrug: *“Sure.”*  
Finally, I asked if he loved her. He hesitated (like he always did when not lying, but not being fully honest) and said, *“Sure.”*

The non-enthusiastic *""sure""* hit me so hard I wanted to beg him to come back.

We kept meeting up for coffee and catching up for about 2 weeks. One day he asked, *“Do you still love me? Not just as a friend, but like how you loved me when we were teenagers?”* I didn’t answer at first, then I nodded. He nodded too and said, *“I still love you too. Honestly, I don’t even know if what I have with Kayla is love. She’s toxic and I’m pretty sure she’s using me.”*

I asked why he hadn’t left her. He said, *“I feel like I owe her. She was there when I was at my lowest, so I feel like I have to stay.”* That broke me all over again.

The next day, he texted saying he told Kayla we’d been getting coffee. She flipped — called him every name, called me a \[girl who gets around\], accused me of using him, spewed a ton of nasty stuff. He asked if he could come over. Of course I said yes.

We put on a movie, played games, and we ended up kissing. It felt like being teenagers again.

He told Kayla and broke up with her. She tried to “expose” me as a gold digger (which is ridiculous, since I don’t care about his money at all). She failed spectacularly.

Now, Tom and I have been back together for about a year, and we’ve been talking seriously about getting engaged.

Do I feel bad for helping him cheat? Honestly… no. Not at all. I got my soulmate back, and I lost the toxic “friend” I should have cut off years ago.",1,1750561759.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The finest cake teas reviewed are crafted from high quality black, green, or rooibos tea leaves, combined with natural flavorings.

**Base Tea Leaves**

The foundation of any great cake tea lies in the quality of its tea leaves.High-quality cake teas often feature a robust black tea base, such as Assam or Ceylon, known for their bold flavors that complement the sweetness of the cake-inspired ingredients. Green tea varieties, like Sencha or Dragon Well, provide a lighter, more floral foundation that pairs well with fruitier cake flavors. Rooibos, a naturally caffeine-free option, offers a smooth, earthy base ideal for those seeking a relaxing evening beverage.

**Natural Flavorings and Ingredients**

To authentically replicate the taste of cake, premium cake teas rely on natural flavorings. This could include cocoa nibs for a chocolate cake flavor, vanilla bean pieces for a vanilla cake essence, or freeze-dried berries to mimic the taste of fruit-filled cakes. The absence of artificial flavors differentiates high-quality cake teas from cheaper alternatives, providing a richer and more satisfying taste experience.

**Aromatic Blends**

Good cake teas also feature an aromatic profile of sweet and spicy scents such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger for a truly inviting and decadent blend. These notes help cut through the sweetness of the cake-inspired flavours and add depth to the tea.**caffeine content**

Many cake teas contain caffeine naturally present in the tea leaves (typically black and green tea).This can range from moderate to high depending on the specific base tea used.However, caffeine-free options using rooibos or herbal blends are also available, catering to different preferences and dietary needs.

Key features of the optimal cake tea include:

*   High-quality tea leaves
*   Natural flavorings and ingredients
*   Complex aromatic blends
*   Appropriate caffeine content for the tea type.

## FAQs Section

Many people wonder about the unique nuances of cake tea and the differences in processing and flavor profile as compared to other teas. Here are some common questions about cake tea:

**What type of sweetener pairs best with cake tea?**
The best type of sweetener depends on the specific flavor of the cake tea. Agave and raw sugar work well with flavours such as vanilla or chocolate. With lighter rooibos-based cake teas, honey may be the more appropriate solution.

**What are the optimal temperatures for brewing the perfect cake tea?**

The optimal brewing temperature depends on the type of tea. Green tea should be brewed at lower temperatures (around 175°F or 80°C) to prevent bitterness, while black tea can withstand higher temperatures (around 212°F or 100°C). Rooibos can also be brewed at higher temperatures. always check the specific instructions provided by the tea vendor for best results.

**how long will the cake tea stay fresh after I open it?**

Cake tea should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to maintain its freshness. Properly stored, it can typically last for several months without significant loss of flavor. However, it's best to consume it within 3-6 months for optimal taste.

So I’m recently experiencing really low views on my TikTok and I don’t understand why I use to get between 500-1000 view each post but since  last week I’ve only been getting 0-50 view maybe a 100 with only about 10 likes which is unusual for me. I’ve watch other TikTok’s with people having the same problem and tried to use creators search insights to help ,but the views are still pretty low. I’ve check my account status and it says I have a live violation for hate speech that happened a year ago and I couldn’t get it appealed (I’ve tried ). But since this problem is recent I don’t think it should affect my page right now since after the strike I was still getting a good amount of views and haven’t had any problems with any of my videos and iam still allowed to go live but I just don’t do lives because I’m not comfortable yet . My question is how can I get out of this super low views problem? And Is my content just not as entertaining to my community anymore ?

1lhdmsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarletonU/comments/1lhdmsk/question_about_residence/,Question About Residence,"So, I got a room in Lennox and Addington, a double traditional room, and I got into Mechanical Engineering. The questions I have are nothing serious so you don't have to bother yourself by responding, but if you want to, please do, any answers will help.

Now, I am mainly asking this because I don't want my expectations to get high, but in terms of space, how much do I exactly have? Like, I was discussing with my roommate, and we were talking about getting consoles for the dorm and everything, but now that I have properly looked at the room size after touring Carleton, I feel like I have really gotten my hopes up. I have been to some friends dorms and they were definitely bigger than Carleton, and we played VR, PS5, and Xbox, which was really fun so I really wanted to do that as well with my friends.

Questions:

1. Do I have space on the desk to have two monitor setup with my pc being under the desk?
2. Can I bring maybe a small TV in for the console? And is there a place to mount the TV where they won't get mad about?
3. Is it possible to do an Ethernet connection to my PC? (On their website they recommend to bring an ethernet cable, so that's why I am asking this).
4. Is it smart to have my own coffee machine in the dorm? Or am I going to hate it after a while because of the smell that can build up? (I have heard the air flow in the dorm is pretty bad, so I am asking this just in case).
5. Is there space to get my own chair for the dorm? (Like a gaming chair)",3,1750560616.0,CarletonU,4,1.0,False

1lhdggy,https://i.redd.it/o42m1hbr5e8f1.jpeg,Breville Barista Express > Bambino Plus > Dual Boiler & Niche Zero,"Wanted to share our experience with these machines in case anyone was interested or it helps someone in the decision making process.

We decided to upgrade our coffee machine (Breville Barista Express) to a separate machine + grinder combo, with a budget of around $900 AUD.

I read through many, many posts on this subreddit, YouTube, and other forums and reviews to determine the best value for money within our price range.

Eventually I decided that the Bambino Plus and the DF54 would be the right choice and a major upgrade to our existing machine. We liked the compact size of both these machines, the price, the appearance and the overall good reviews.

Due to lack of time, we bought the Bambino Plus first and decided to use the grinder in our BBE in the meantime.

Our experience with the Bambino Plus:
In comparison to the BBE, this machine felt much cheaper on first impression. We encountered several issues:
	•	Portafilter attachment - Tightening the portafilter was a horrible experience. As a small female, I felt like I was fighting to keep the machine in place while trying to turn the portafilter into the group head - even after the machine had warmed up and we’d used it a couple of times after turning it on.
	•	Vibration - The vibrations on the drip tray felt like a massive design/functionality flaw to us. We were not using small or light cups, but they were jittering all over the place the second the brew started, moving them away from the spouts and almost dropping off the machine completely. This machine was meant to be more convenient, yet we needed to stand there to hold our cup in place for 30 seconds? We ended up using a silicone mat which helped.
	•	Steam wand inconsistencies - My partner found the auto steam was inconsistent and often created big bubbles (understand it would be hard to get velvety foam but it was frustrating that it wasn’t at least the same each time). I used manual steaming but found the steam wand tip heated the milk a bit too quickly, and it was hard for me to get the milk consistency right.
	•	Espresso inconsistency - The espresso often felt inconsistent too, even with a scale, with different acidity and bitterness, and varying grams of espresso out. But this was whilst using the BBE grinder so that could have been a factor.

We wanted to love the machine, but it had so many downsides that after a month we decided to return it to the store.

Our final setup:
This then led us on our search again, to which we somehow ended up tripling our budget (a bit of a buy once, cry once scenario) and purchasing the Breville Dual Boiler and Niche Zero grinder.

And we have been extremely happy - the coffee has been far better than anything we’ve had from local coffee shops. Once we got the hang of the grind settings, it has been consistent with 18g in and 36g out. The BDB feels well built, heavy, and holds lots of water, and the 3-hole steam wand tip feels perfect - not too slow or fast. The heat up time is just a few minutes (or we use the auto timer for the morning). 

Love the Niche Zero - somehow the grinding sounds satisfying? And it’s been easy to adjust with no retention since the first couple of grinds.
It took us a while to get it right, but it’s been a major upgrade that we hope to use for many years and we’re extremely satisfied with this duo.

TL;DR
	•	Bambino Plus: Didn’t work for our needs despite good reviews (vibration, portafilter issues, inconsistent steaming)
	•	BDB + Niche Zero: Much higher investment but significantly better results and build quality
	•	Worth the extra spend if you’re serious about home espresso

I really liked him from the get-go, and he seemed to like me too. During our phone conversation, I found out that he goes back and forth to our home country a lot since most of his family is there. The last time I went is when I was two years old. My whole family is over here (in a western country). I have pretty severe travel anxiety and I asked him how often he goes and how often he expects his wife to go with him. He mentioned that he wants to go any time there’s a death or wedding and expects his wife to pretty much always go with him. He also loves traveling. I know myself - I’ve always hated staying places that aren’t home. When I have to, I always bring my own bedsheets, towels, etc., but it makes me super anxious regardless and I always try to go home early. It’s especially worse when durning my monthly cycle. I broke it off with him before things progress and it’s even harder to stop seeing each other. I can’t seem to shake the feeling of regret because I think I may have been catching feelings for him. I tell myself I was looking out for my future self but can’t help but feeling heartbroken and having second thoughts. My brain is telling me that this is as the best choice but my heart disagrees.

I get this deep feeling of despair when I see people enjoying life with friends and significant others. Outside my Los Angeles apartment at the pool I see parties going on. I'll sit at one of the chairs nearby just to absorb some of the energy, watching others relish in weekend celebrations. One particular group looked straight out of a sitcom, three beautiful couples in their 30's sipping cocktails and sharing stories about life. They were discussing plans for dinner and checking out an outdoor movie at the park. Just hearing this puts a pit in my stomach; its an evening I wish I could share with people. I do have friends spread around, but we are getting older, and with that comes new commitments, whether it be a wife or a baby or a strenuous job.

I have a decent job in the industry but it's all remote. The most socializing I get is through people online in discords (gross) or going to be local bookstore and coffee shops. And for those latter people, they always seem to contain some impenetrable layer, a veil they refuse to let me see past, as if to keep their social life free of my sclerotic energy.

The reality is these interactions are happening at such large capacities around the world at all times, it would be insane to think I am missing out by not being socially connected at all times. Yet logic doesn't  soothe the profound loneliness that I experience on nights like these. I just know these feelings are exacerbated by our current technological epoch, yet there doesn't seem to be a solution but to try your best to make connections at any moment. All I can do is continue to go outside and observe, perhaps find an opening to talk with a stranger. I've been successful a couple times, but many days are spent in silent observation, absorbing interactions that are not meant for me.

I'm going to go out and get a bite to eat, perhaps drink a beer, and partake once again in these rituals.If nothing comes from it, perhaps I will come home and have another.

1lhd5fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1lhd5fn/one_year_gone/,One year gone,"A year ago today, my Dad died. 

The night before, we had been sitting on the couch, laughing while watching a YouTube video that was giving all the highlights of each of the teams in the Euro 2024 tournament. He went up to bed, and I went to sleep on the couch because there wasn't air conditioning in my room. The next morning he collapsed in the kitchen, and it woke me up. It was 6am. I remember the sounds he made. I can't describe them, but they haunt me. I called the ambulance, they tried to give him CPR. I remember him sitting up for a second and wiping his hand across his face, his eyes open. The EMTs tried to get him to talk. But he passed out again. They took him to the hospital. I stayed behind and cleaned coffee creamer off the kitchen floor, put the shards of his favorite mug with my college logo on it that I had given him as a gift in the sink. I went to the hospital, and it wasn't long before they took us in that room. The one you see on TV. The one where you know the doctor is going to come in and give the bad news. We saw his body one last time in the hospital room. He just looked like he was sleeping. They gave me the plastic bag full of his stuff -- his pajama pants, t shirt, and his watch. I went home and sat on his bed and just stared at his stuff and sobbed.  

Last year was the worst year of my life. I had been unemployed over a year already when my Dad died. Laid off from a well-paid tech job that I loved after company restructuring. Someone I thought I had a connection with, who told me they wouldn't disappear, did exactly that. My world fell apart. It's a weird thing to have to try to move through life -- keep applying to jobs, cook, clean, exercise, get out of bed, etc -- when everything feels shattered.

Grief is a weird thing. No one knows what it's like until it happens to them. I see the looks on people's faces when I tell them and they haven't experienced it. They never know what to say. I understand that, and don't blame them for it. But it's isolating sometimes. Today's just another day for lots of people. First day of summer. It always used to be my favorite day of the year because it's the longest day. Now it's the hardest day. 

Something no one ever tells you about grief is that you don't just grieve losing that person. You grieve losing a piece of yourself. Maybe I'll be somewhat whole again one day. But I will never be the same. I miss the person I was 2.5 years ago. Someone who felt optimistic about life. Someone who felt joy. Someone who was thriving, not merely surviving. 

I scattered some of my Dad's cremains on a beach in Mexico not long ago. We've scattered some in a couple other countries, too. He loved to travel but didn't get to do it as much as he'd wanted. I don't know how many other places we'll scatter them, but I hope we can help him see the world even in death. 

I did nothing today. Sat in my room, still with no air conditioning, and talked to a friend on Discord. Talked to ChatGPT who's my therapist in a pinch (I have a real therapist that I talked to yesterday). Napped a bit. Played Rollercoaster Tycoon. And thought about my Dad. Everything's still a mess. Nothing ever feels right anymore. Somehow nothing is different but everything is.",4,1750559028.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

- i like to play video games a lot in my free time, like a lot a lot! some of the games i like to play with others are fortnite and roblox, and some that are single player that i love to play are fallout, Farcry, cyberpunk, terraria, borderlands, and minecraft as well! i play on a ps5, if you were wondering!

No big deal, I didn't pay attention to this neither and bought the food to the table, only for the customer to attempt handing the entire plate back to me, because they did not want the bread. I apologize about the fucking bread being on their plate and that it wasn't any extra cost to them to have it. You know, just don't eat it. But no, he wanted to physically reach into his plate to take away the bread and hand it to me cause he didn't want to eat it. 


This isn't the only time neither. The other it was my fault, I just started and forgot that calling an order over medium meant that it came with grits instead of just being on the side. Again, I have adhd s

Mika(C1) is running Noblesse with ER sands, C.Rate circlet and Fav(R5), that brings him to 66% C.Rate, which should reliably hit 84% with resonance bonus to proc the Fav.

Shenhe is on 2pc Shimenawa/EOSF with PJWS, I'm aiming for Mika and Shenhe to have enough ER to reliably use burst every rotation (especially Mika, since I do need Skirk to heal up to maintain MH buff).

So Mika heals to maintain MH buff, provides ATK buff and speed, while Shenhe provides NA/CA dmg bonus along with cryo res shred with burst.

Other options to consider:

* Yelan or XQ

I thought I was a normal human until that day I accidentally made my dorm senior passed out with a little push. It turned out I'm a Grey, a race of superhumans. In the Greys realm, I discovered my unique bloodline, super powers, and FIVE amazing partners—my soulmates.
**
“Wake up, Miss Banks,” a smooth voice says, the tone washes over me like a loving caress, and for the first time in a very long time I feel safe and it's not something I want to wake up from just yet.
I nuzzle my face into the warmth against my cheek. 
A grunt of disapproval ruins my contentment right before I am dropped unceremoniously onto my back. The landing is soft but still unpleasant.
“What the he-ll!” I curse, rushing to sit and take in my surroundings.
I'm on a couch in a dimly lit room, bright light suddenly floods the room making me squint against it. 
I shift my attention to the source of the light, fighting the urge to hiss at it like a feral vampire. 
A large figure is framed by the beaming sunlight that is flooding the room through a window that spans the entire wall.
The figure is fussing with the curtains that he's just opened and I quickly recognise him—the man who bailed me out of the police station and made me sleep in a second!
The events of the day come rushing back to me like a tidal wave of anger, fear and complete confusion.
“Who are you? How did we get here?” I demand, gesturing to the room and jumping to my feet.
“I don't have time to baby you through this, so here is the quick version,” he starts as he unbuttons his suit jacket and hangs it over the back of a large leather office chair. 
“My name is Deacon Collins, I am the headmaster of Grey’s Academy and you are the newest student here. Tell me, what do you know about your heritage?” he asks. 
My eyes are transfixed on his hands as he unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls up each sleeve to expose some impressive forearms. 
A throat clearing snaps me out of my trance.
“Oh… um,” I start, embarrassed at being caught staring. “Sorry, I'm a little lost here. I'm not feeling myself,” I say with a sigh and flop down onto the couch. I try to process what the he-ll is going on.
“Due to your circumstances, I am going to assume you know nothing. Here at Greys Academy, our students are gifted…” he begins.
“Wait, gifted?” I interrupt, “I think there's been a mistake. I'm not gifted, I got a pass in all my exams but nothing that makes me stand out,”
“If you'd let me finish Miss Banks…”
“Josie,” I correct, not liking the way he uses ‘Miss Banks’ in an inferior way.
“Miss Banks,” he reiterates, “If you would just keep quiet for two minutes and let me explain then you can be on your way. Our Academy is for what we call Greys. Greys are a race of superhumans. Whilst we are much more powerful than regular humans, we are also small in number. For this reason, we have created our own realm within the human one. This is safer for everyone to live in peace. Somehow, you have slipped through the net and grown up within the human realm. I will be launching a full investigation into how that came to pass, but for now, you are here and you are safe. Now I appreciate this is a lot for you to take in and you have a lot of catching up to do so I won't overwhelm you today. I will have my assistant assign you a dorm room and pair you with one of our more intellectual students to do extra studies with you outside of your regular lessons. I will also schedule some extra studies with our tutors here. Any questions?” he says without a flicker of a smile.
“Oh, you are good,” I laugh. “I love this show! I used to watch it all the time,” I say between bouts of laughter. 
I get up and start exploring the room to find the hidden cameras. I can't believe I'm on the prank show. 
I wonder who nominated me, it must have been Freya, my best friend from college. 
“Was it Freya that put you up to this?” I giggle.
“Miss Banks!” the actor playing Mr Collins shouts, slamming his hand down on the desk, which just makes me laugh harder.
I approach him and examine the buttons on his shirt, one must be a hidden camera. 
Then I start rubbing my hands over his shirt, feeling for the hidden wires. 
In a flash his hands wrap around my wrists, making me gasp in shock as he grips them hard, stopping my exploration. 
I look up at him and his eyes are intense as they stare back at me. “What the he-ll are you doing?” he asks in an almost growl.
“Looking for your mic?” I gulp.
“I don't have a mic, this is not a prank. You are new here and you've had a lot to take in so this once I will give you a pass, but if you lay your hands on me ever again there will be punishment. Do you understand?” he says in a low, scary tone. 
His heavy breathing makes me bite my tongue because I really want to taunt him about what this punishment might be. As if he knows what I'm thinking his eyes seem to flash blue. 
That's when I remember them doing that earlier, right before he demanded that I sleep, a demand I was powerless to resist. 
Panic bubbles inside me at the realisation. He's telling the truth, isn't he?
“You made me go to sleep,” I say with a shaky breath. 
He gives me a single nod in response. “What else can you make me do?” I ask. 
Fear at how vulnerable I am right now pushes me to ask the question.
“Anything,” he says in a husky whisper, and his face moves closer to mine.
His answer doesn't scare me like it should, if anything it excites me.
Then a door opens, breaking the trance he has me in, he drops my wrists and takes a step back as if I'm suddenly repulsive to him. I turn to see who the intruder is.
“I thought I heard voices in here. Is everything okay Dee?” a very attractive woman who looks to be in her thirties says as she walks into the room with a beaming smile.
Her hair is jet black and shines as the sunlight hits it. It's the sort of hair that should be in shampoo ads and just enhances her stunning blue eyes and flawless skin. She wears a skin-tight black dress that shows off her hourglass figure and black stilettos, with her finger and toenails painted bright red. She is the kind of woman that makes you feel insecure as soon as you see her.
“Yes. Clarrisa, this is Josie Banks, a new student I've just picked up from the human realm. Could you please assign her one of the single dorm rooms in Ruby,” Mr Collins says, whilst he takes out the file from his briefcase that the police officer had given him earlier and holds it out to Clarrisa.
“Are you sure? There's plenty of space for her in Amber or Saphire,” Clarrisa says, giving me an assessing look up and down before scrunching her nose a little.
“Put her in Ruby please and make sure she has everything she needs,” he says dismissively. Then he sits at his desk and opens up a laptop. I stand there unsure of what I’m supposed to do now. Mr Collins glances up at Clarrisa and then me. “That will be all,” he grunts.
“Of course Deacon, Josie follow me please,” Clarrisa smiles tightly.
With a sigh, I follow perfect Clarrisa.
We exit the office into a glass-lined corridor, Clarrisas heels click loudly on the cream marble floor. Everything feels too bright and shiny.
Clarrisa leads me to an elevator as I think about what is happening. I'm in freaking Hogwarts, and that makes Mr Collins Professor Dumbledore.
“Sorry, it's been a wild day,” I explain.
“I can imagine. Don't worry about Deacon, he was taking his morning shower when the call came in about you, he had to rush off without his morning coffee, he's grumpy without his coffee,” she laughs, a little too much for it to be real.
My mind is suddenly filled with thoughts of Mr Collins in the shower, then I realise what she said. If she was there when he got the call, that means she was there when he was showering. She's his girlfriend… or wife.
My heart sinks a little. I thought I'd felt some chemistry in our short encounter, but I guess it was a wro thought anyway. Students and teachers dating is a huge no. Why am I wasting time thinking about this when my life has just been completely obliterated?
“Wait!” I blurt. “What about my stuff? Can I go back for it?” I ask.
“Deacon will arrange for your belongings to get to you, try not to worry and just focus on making your new life here. I know this is a difficult time but I'm sure you will be happy here, we will work everything out to make this transition as easy as possible for you,” she says as we walk through a maze of glass and marble corridors. 
We exit the building into a courtyard with a huge fountain in the middle. The water comes out through four spouts. Above each spout is a large crystal. 
Clarrisa stops walking for a moment to let me look at it. “Each crystal represents a house at our Academy. You have been assigned to Ruby for the time being,” she motions to the red stone. 
“You can easily identify your fellow house students by the colour of their tie. Red for Ruby, green for Emerald, blue for Sapphire and yellow for Amber,” she explains as we walk on. 
I mentally roll my eyes at the thought of wearing a uniform again. I'm almost 19 years old and I feel like I'm going back to secondary school.
“Where are the other students?” I ask, taking note of how quiet it is.
“They are all in classes, they'll be finishing soon. We have just over 300 students here, it can get quite busy between classes,” she grimaces.
Clarrisa ushers me on and towards an old-looking stone building that's embellished with Rubies. “This is your building,” she says as we go through the door. 
I look around in awe. It's stunning. It's like an old castle inside but with everything you'd expect in a modern house. 
I follow Clarrisa up the stairs and down a hall, we pass two doors before she stops and hands me a key. 
“This one is yours, I'll give you some time to settle in and someone will be along shortly to show you around,” she smiles and walks away before I can even mutter a thank-you or get the door open.
I stand in the doorway of my new room open-mouthed. This must be a mistake. This is nothing you'd expect of a dorm. This is more like a hotel suite.
The bed is huge, king-size at least, and the pillows are like plush clouds that I just want to jump into. I almost squeal in excitement.
The whole place is a luxury that I've only ever seen on TV and I have no idea how I am going to pay for it because I don't think a part-time job around my studies is going to cut it.
After a hot shower, I feel a million times better. I wrap myself in the luxury robe and head over to the bookshelves to check out the selection. 
A book titled ‘Greys’ catches my eye and whilst it's not the fiction I was hoping for it looks like a good place to start learning about my new life. I climb into the window nook and start reading.
I learned that Greys are a superhuman race that possess powers that include but are not limited to; super strength, manifestation, teleportation, shapeshifting, superior speed, compulsion, telepathy and telekinesis.
I blow out a breath and close the book, already feeling overwhelmed and not sure if I can believe all this. 
Voices outside my window catch my attention and I lean closer to look down at the ground outside. 
There's a group of men heading towards my building, they push and shove each other playfully and as they get closer I notice how dirty and dishevelled they look. Maybe they were a part of the group that was combat training.
The men file into the door beneath my room and out of sight, except for one. 
From this angle, I can't see much of his features but he looks tall with a mess of blonde hair that's long on the top but shaved on the sides.
He seems puzzled as he turns around and scans his surroundings, maybe he's looking for someone.
I glance in the direction he's looking to see if I can see anyone he might be waiting for but there's no one else in sight.
I look back at the man and gasp, jumping back from the window when I see him staring straight at me. 
I swear his eyes flashed blue like Mr Collins had right before he'd used his powers on me.
Once I've composed myself I slowly edge back to the window, peeking over the sill to see if he's still there.
I blow out a breath when I find the courtyard empty once again.
A knock at my door makes me jump once again.
Why am I so jumpy all of a sudden? Actually, that's a dumb question.
I've literally been dragged from my life and dumped into a whole new realm, where the people have powers and can command me to do whatever they like. 
I need to keep my guard up and my wits about me if I'm going to survive in this place. 
I open the door expecting to see Mr Collins, Clarrisa or someone delivering my belongings, but the face that greets me is none of those. 
It's the blonde man I'd seen through my window.",1,1750558467.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1lhcz3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1lhcz3y/end_of_my_caffeine_free_exploring/,End of My Caffeine Free Exploring,"Today I ended my caffeine free journey of six months. 

Six months ago I stopped having my coffee in the morning. I used to make it very strong - three heaping teaspoons Turkish Style. 

First 2-3 months were tough - anxiety, poor sleep rapid heart beat, elevated blood sugar. 

After 3 months these things subsided. I went on low carb diet to deal with the rise in blood sugar. What I didn’t connect to caffeine free life - I started seriously overeating. I was loading on fats. Nuts, unlimited cheese, heavy cream. I was HUNGRY all the time. I started packing on weight. 

To stop and reverse this progression I embarked on calorie counting. When I decreased calories I was totally OUT OF ENERGY. I could not enjoy my hikes, I had no energy to do stuff at home. I thought it is age. Plus, I was HUNGRY all the time. I needed treats. 

Today after my walk in the morning I decided to have coffee to see if it will change my energy levels. I brewed it mildly and it simply fixed me. It felt as if I am 10 years younger. 

My husband said that he thought I am having a love affair! 😂 I went to a mall and tried all perfumes. I patiently chose foundation in Sephora. I forgot about hunger. Lately shopping was unpleasant due to constant HUNGER and dizziness. 

Will I sleep tonight? I think I will! I got plenty tired today since I was on my feet all day long! So unusual for me as lately I became extremely sedentary. 

It was interesting exploration to go caffeine free for six months and it taught me a few things about myself. I doubt I will go caffeine free again. To me it didn’t worth it.

1lhcxx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1lhcxx8/update_to_its_not_always_perimenopause/,UPDATE to It's not always perimenopause...,"I still don't know how to flair this.

There was a lot of interest in how I came to know that I have MCI & WMD. (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1lgu9vt/its\_not\_always\_perimenopause/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1lgu9vt/its_not_always_perimenopause/) for original post)

Here's my story. Bear with the two paragraphs of context. I can't figure out how to streamline this.

First, you need to know that people with higher levels of education and ""intelligence"" tend to be diagnosed with MCI and dementia much later than others. We tend to be able to mask and compensate well, so people don't know what's actually going inside our heads for the early stages \[Note: the Alzheimer's Societies of the US and the UK have really great resources addressing stages and progressions.\]

Second, you need to know that I'm highly educated and ""intelligent."" My work has always been very cerebral. My career focused on helping non-academics understand and work with complex scientific and engineering concepts in ways that made sense to them. Also, I've been in perimenopause for 10 years now. Next year will be 50 years since I first got my period.

About 3 or 4 years ago, I started noticing problems in a few cognitive domains. Concentration, processing and understanding new information (horrifying, given my livelihood), reasoning, basic math, and my sense of time all were increasingly problematic issues for me.

Signs were subtle and easy to dismiss at first. Hormones. Stress. Anxiety. Life upheavals. All that kind of stuff can seriously impact the quality of your thinking. After a couple of years, I kept telling myself that there were a million ""normal"" reasons why I couldn't remember without prompting events that happened more than 2 days ago. Everybody forgets the occasional word & whole dinner party, or calls a shoe a couch without noticing, right? My not being able to retrieve information and memories happens to everybody, right? Right? (pro tip - if you blank on a word, try to say it in a different language. This can jiggle your synapses enough for retrieval)

It was a slow slide downward. I kept everything to myself for a couple of years, half thinking I was a hypochondriac of the mind. I faked it so long and so hard until I just couldn't anymore. I finally told my partner when I accepted that I honestly was having trouble doing my work. It was probably another year before I told my therapist. She cajoled me into seeing a neurologist who specializing in dementia issues. From that point, things went relatively quickly. Because I'm me, I brought him tons of data, logs of everything that felt wrong in my head.

I was diagnosed with MCI by the neuro through in-office assessments. (A bit ironically, I cannot for the life of me remember any names for them. There was a clock and a story about a 3 alarm fire.) A brain MRI with & without contrast showed the evidence of both the WMD and my seasonal allergies. That cracked me up. The WMD is the cause of my MCI. Neither are reversible.

I appear to be one of the lucky ones, in that my WMD doesn't show signs of developing into vascular (or another) dementia. Essentially, the signs and symptoms I have is my new normal. After a lifetime of devotion to the life of the mind, I'm an airhead. But an airhead with a normal lifespan who needs someone to check her math.

My neuro's prescription for me going forward is getting good sleep and adequate exercise. Keeping my blood pressure and cholesterol under control is important. My partner has a list of behaviors and such to watch out for, as signs that my status has degraded more. I'm in speech therapy to learn additional compensatory strategies to support my cognition. Other than that, I'll get evaluated in a year.

A big help for me is established routines for ADLs. A specific landing pad in the kitchen for my coffee cup helps me not lose it so often. Multiple alarms and alerts for upcoming events get me places. Charging my phone at the same time lets me know that it should be next to the bed at night. That sort of thing.

I'm keeping the diagnosis very close to my IRL chest. Nobody but my nearest and dearest need know anything, especially because I'm not progressing downward.

Please be careful if you offer comfort to someone in my situation. There are no drugs to help my particular condition. Granted, some forms of MCI are caused by addressable chemical imbalances and some forms of early dementia might respond to drug therapy. That's wonderful news for those people. I'm very happy that that's the case for them. It's not for me.

I hope this is useful to someone. Let me know if there are specific questions I can address.",15,1750558330.0,Menopause,0,0.94,False

You could also mix 2 blends (one at a time) by going with half-cup option.

My cup of coffee was certainly better tasting than what I am used to in other Panera cafes and it seems like the company is trying to make some incremental improvements in its core hot beverage offerings.  I hope the new machines are not just for ""market testing"".  Btw, the location was a new cafe in Durham, NC, which opened on Wednesday June 18 according to the team member.

As a kid my parents were deep in addiction. I went through a lot due to this. I’m unsure of how I’ve been affected by the indirect things. 


To preface this-I won’t deny that the broken child in me still sometimes seeks validation for what I went through. It’s partly the reason for this post, it was downplayed and ignored for most of my life. If this fact bothers you, then please be kind and don’t read it.

 The things that happened to me were sickening, but happened TO me. So worse things could have overshadowed it?

I ran away at 16 and eventually moved a few hours away before my life finally calmed down.

1. There were a lot of people that moved in from a city and brought a lot of violence. I watched a man be stabbed and die in the street near my house. Not long after we watched another man get shot in the same place, but he lived. 

2. I watched my cousin hit a man in the head with the back of an axe because he robbed him.(still split his head open enough to squirt blood out like a horror movie) While pouring blood from his head my cousin walked him through the house to make him grab what he’d stolen. Past me and my 3 younger siblings. 

3. My mom left the house for a bit and my dad lost it. He used my school laptop and sat by the window to steal the neighbors internet to message her. He said my brother cut his foot and needed stitches. When he left the room I messaged that he was lying and it’s a trap and then I deleted it. He came back and told us “You’ve got 10 minutes to grab the things you need and love. I am setting this house on fire.” Then he gathered my mom’s belongings and set them on fire. 

4. My dad attacked my mom and punched holes in the wall around her head. I took my 2yr old sister to the basement and hid under a blanket with her. My mom followed and sat on the bed. My dad followed her and started smashing things with a baseball bat. The walls around us, the coffee table in front of us and everything on it. She chased him. He knocked her down and stomped on her ankle, breaking it. She ran back in the room, sat next to us, and pulled out a gun. They fought like this often. Maybe it’s not right to be mad at her for this. I thought rather than endangering us because they were high and stupid, she should have ran elsewhere. She shouldn’t have brought it to where I ran to hide with the baby.

5. As we sat on our front porch I watched one of my parents close friends get beat across the face with a piece of conduit. His face was flayed open. He had warrants and couldn’t go to the hospital so I watched some woman stitch his face up with a sewing needle. I watched him get his face sewn up like this when he was pistol whipped as well.

6. I watched my brother pull a gun on his girlfriend and take 4 shots around her head in our basement.

7. After fleeing from more of my parents drama I took my siblings to sleep at my aunts. I woke up to her screaming and pointing a gun at her boyfriend who was standing directly in front of where we were lying on the floor.

8. I watched my aunt stab my mom’s boyfriend 8 times in the back with a fork for beating on my mom. She stabbed it at deep as she could and shoved him down and stomped on it. Then my aunts boyfriend wrapped his arm around him and picked him up by his neck until he choked him out and dropped him on the floor. (Crackhead strength is real, he was awake and back at it within a few minutes.)

9. A woman that grew up down the street from us was coming down and losing it while trying to talk a guy into giving her more drugs. He wouldn’t so she took and exacto knife and stabbed and sliced herself multiple times so he’d have to come back to take her to the hospital. Honestly, the gashes were one of the most disgusting things I’ve ever seen.  The worst one was from the top of her thigh down to her knee, they were deep too. 

10. I watched my uncle pick my aunt up by her neck and repeatedly smash her against his truck in front of their toddler children.

11. I watched my dad beat my mom’s boyfriend within an inch of his life with a padlock. His eye was popped out onto his face a little. There was blood everywhere, we were covered. The ceiling, walls, floor, some even made it out the window. They made us go to church directly after. Traumatized sitting in the church noticing little specks of blood we’d missed while cleaning ourselves off. 

12. One of the other times he beat him was pretty bad, but it wasn’t so gory until they landed on something and his arm was sliced elbow to wrist. You could see the bone and it was all wide open and flapping. He shoved him out the window head first. I couldn’t see what happened from there, but there was blood EVERYWHERE. He came back the next day and I saw the aftermath and it was awful. 

13.My parents were fist fighting and my mom ran outside to the van and locked herself in. We were outside and my 3yo sister ran for her and hopped in the van with her. My dad came out and started smashing the van with baseball bats, pieces of metal, logs, anything he could get his hands on. Then he started grabbing dumbbells and throwing them at the door to the van. We lived in a bad area and cops came by pretty often. I stood behind the van hiding trying to wave one of them down, but he didn’t notice what I was doing. The first time in my life I’d ever called the cops because I was sure if he didn’t stop he’d kill my sister. (I’ve only called one other time because my sister was flashed by a guy on the street so I called for her) 

14. I watched my brothers and uncle kick the living shit out of a creepy guy that used to buy drugs from my dad. He hung around even after my dad went to prison and wouldn’t leave our house. He’d followed me and my little sister around saying super nasty things. 

15. I also watched them kick the shit out of my exs dad. When I started dating my ex, I didn’t realize I knew his dad. He’d pressured and supplied me with hard drugs when I was 14. I ended up moving in with them at 16 because we had nowhere to go. 

He blocked me in a room threatening to kill me screaming “the voices showed me a video of you in my room. You were wearing a yellow hoodie! I know you stole my things!” He said he’d drag me out by my hair. I can’t remember everything he said, but it was awful and terrifying. 

After this we talked to his family about it. They opended up and told us he molested his stepdaughter. He has charges against him for supplying a girl my age with drugs and then locking her up in the house around the time he’d pressured me into doing drugs with him. They sprayed mace down his pants and threw him down 3 flights of concrete stairs. 

16. I didn’t witness it, but I did see the aftermath of what they did to my uncle after he molested me. 
 

Although these are bad, there’s still so much more, some worse. I don’t know how these things affected me because they’re so overshadowed. 
When I think of my childhood trauma these aren’t even the things I think of. They had to have affected me in some way, I am just not sure how.

1lhclq2,https://youtu.be/ypu_rBbF31M,3 Very Scary TRUE Airbnb Cabin Horror Stories,"# ""Six Points, One Circle"":

I loved my cabin in the woods. It was my haven, a place where I could escape the grind of city life. Tall pines surrounded it, their branches whispering in the breeze, and a small stream gurgled just beyond the backyard. The cabin itself was warm and inviting—wooden walls polished to a soft glow, a stone fireplace that crackled with life when lit, and big windows that let in the dappled light of the forest. I bought it a few years ago, poured my heart into fixing it up, and started renting it out on Airbnb when I wasn’t there. It felt good to share its peace with others, and the extra income helped keep it mine.Last spring, I got a booking request from a group of five young men, all in their early twenties, looking for a weekend getaway. The leader, Tom, had a solid profile—four-star reviews, verified ID, and a friendly tone in his messages. He asked about nearby hiking trails and fishing spots, saying they wanted a “chill weekend in nature.” The other four had similar profiles, all with positive feedback from past hosts. Nothing seemed off, so I approved the booking and sent Tom the usual instructions: check-in details, house rules, and a reminder to leave the place tidy by Sunday afternoon. He replied, “Thanks! We’ll take good care of it.”The weekend passed without a hitch, or so I thought. I was swamped with work, so I didn’t check my phone much. No messages from Tom, no complaints from neighbors. Monday afternoon, I drove up to the cabin to clean and prep for the next guests. The drive was familiar, the winding road through the forest calming my nerves after a hectic week. As I pulled into the gravel driveway, the cabin looked normal. The porch was clear, the curtains drawn, no broken windows or obvious damage. I grabbed my cleaning supplies from the trunk and headed to the door.But as I stepped out of the car, a foul smell hit me. It was sharp and rotten, like spoiled meat left out too long. I gagged, covering my nose with my sleeve, and glanced around. Maybe a deer or raccoon had died nearby, I thought. It happened sometimes in the woods. I shook it off and unlocked the front door, but the smell followed me inside, stronger now, heavy and suffocating. My eyes watered as I set my bag down in the entryway.The living room was a disaster. Empty beer bottles cluttered the coffee table, some tipped over, leaving sticky rings on the wood. Pizza boxes were stacked haphazardly on the floor, crusts and grease stains inside. Chip bags and candy wrappers littered the couch, and a half-eaten sub sandwich sat on the armrest, ants already crawling over it. I groaned, my annoyance growing. I’d have to message Tom about this—they clearly hadn’t even tried to clean up. I snapped a few photos for evidence, just in case I needed to file a claim.I moved to the kitchen, hoping to find the source of the smell. The sink was piled with dirty dishes, pots crusted with food, and a cutting board with dried ketchup smears. But nothing was rotting—no spoiled meat, no forgotten trash. The bathrooms were messy too—towels crumpled on the floor, toothpaste splattered on the sink, but no obvious cause for the stench. I opened every window, letting the forest air in, but the smell didn’t budge. It was like it had soaked into the walls.Standing in the living room, I rubbed my temples, puzzled. Then it hit me: the crawl space under the cabin. I’d found a dead possum there once, and it stank for weeks until I removed it. Maybe something bigger had gotten trapped this time. I grabbed a flashlight from the kitchen drawer, a pair of gloves, and a scarf to tie over my face. The smell was bad enough to make me dizzy, and I wasn’t taking chances.Outside, I walked to the side of the cabin where the crawl space access was—a small wooden panel near the ground. As I got closer, the smell became unbearable, a thick cloud of decay that made my stomach lurch. I knelt down, my scarf pressed tight against my nose, and pried the panel open. The darkness under the cabin swallowed the light at first, but I aimed the flashlight and leaned in.What I saw froze me. Six dead deer lay there, arranged in a perfect circle, their heads pointing inward like the spokes of a wheel. Their eyes were wide open, glassy and unblinking, reflecting the flashlight’s beam. Their bodies were stiff, legs folded unnaturally, as if someone had spent time posing them. Blood had pooled beneath them, dark and sticky, soaking into the dirt. The sight was so wrong, so deliberate, that my brain couldn’t process it. I dropped the flashlight and scrambled back, my breath coming in short gasps. My heart pounded like it would burst.I sat on the ground, staring at the open panel, too shocked to move. Who would do this? Why? My mind raced—maybe it was a prank, a sick joke by the guests. Or something darker, something I couldn’t wrap my head around. I fumbled for my phone and called 911, my voice trembling. “Hello, I need help at my cabin. I found… six dead deer under it, arranged in a circle. I think someone did this on purpose.”The operator’s voice was steady, professional. “Sir, can you confirm your address? And stay outside, away from the scene. Officers will be there soon.”I gave the address, my eyes fixed on the crawl space, half-expecting something to crawl out. I moved to the porch, sitting on the steps, trying to calm down. The smell clung to my clothes, my skin, my mind. I kept seeing those deer, their lifeless stares burned into my memory.Two police officers, Davis and Martinez, arrived about half an hour later. Davis, a tall man with a serious face, carried a notepad. “You the owner?” he asked, glancing at the cabin.I nodded, standing up. “Yes. I found… it’s under the cabin. I don’t know what to make of it.”“Walk us through it,” Martinez said, his voice softer but firm. He was shorter, with a flashlight already in hand.“I rented to five guys for the weekend. They checked out yesterday, I think. I came to clean today and noticed the smell. I thought it was a dead animal, so I checked the crawl space. That’s when I saw the deer.”“You didn’t touch anything?” Davis asked.“No, just opened the panel and looked. I called you right after.”They nodded and went to the crawl space, shining their lights under. Martinez let out a low whistle. “That’s not something you see every day,” he said, his face grim. Davis took photos, the camera flash stark against the shadows.“We’ll need the renters’ details,” Davis said, turning to me. “Names, contact info, anything you have.”“I’ve got it all on Airbnb,” I said, pulling up Tom’s booking on my phone. “I can send it to you.”“Anything else strange inside?” Martinez asked, standing up.“It’s messy—beer bottles, food wrappers, dishes. I haven’t checked the bedrooms yet. The smell was too much.”“Let’s take a look,” Davis said. “You stay here for now.”I waited on the porch, my stomach still churning. The officers went inside, and I heard their muffled voices as they moved through the cabin. After a few minutes, they came back out. “Nothing obvious,” Martinez said. “But we’ll need animal control to handle the deer. This is… unusual, to say the least.”They called for backup and animal control, and I sat there, feeling helpless. The cabin, my place of peace, felt violated. I decided to clean inside while waiting, needing to do something. I started in the living room, bagging up the trash, scrubbing the coffee table. Under the couch, I found something that made my skin crawl—a small leather book, no bigger than a notebook, with strange symbols carved into the cover. I opened it, and the pages were filled with drawings: circles with arrows, triangles inside stars, and words in a language I didn’t recognize. Some pages had notes in English, like “center the focus” and “align the points.” It looked like something occult, but not supernatural—just creepy, like someone’s twisted hobby. I set it on the counter, deciding to give it to the police.I called my neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, who lived down the road. “Hey, Mrs. Johnson, it’s me from the cabin. Did you notice anything odd over the weekend?”She paused, her voice hesitant. “Well, now that you mention it, Saturday night was loud. Music, shouting, like a big party. I looked out my window around midnight and saw a few young men outside your place. They were carrying something heavy, wrapped in a tarp, toward the side of the cabin. I thought it was maybe camping gear or firewood, but it looked… odd. Bulky.”My blood ran cold. “Did you see anything else?”“No, it was dark. I went back to bed. Should I have called you?”“No, it’s okay. Thanks for telling me.”I hung up, my mind racing. A tarp? Heavy and bulky? It had to be the deer. But how did they get six deer, and why arrange them like that? I called Tom next, my hands still shaking. He answered on the third ring, his voice casual. “Hey, this is the cabin owner. Did we leave something behind?”“No, Tom, it’s not that. I found six dead deer under the cabin, arranged in a circle. Do you know anything about it?”He went silent for a moment, then let out a nervous laugh. “What? That’s crazy. No way, man. We just hung out, drank some beers, played cards. Dead deer? That’s not us.”“Did you have other people over? Anyone else at the cabin?”“Just us five, and maybe two friends stopped by for a bit Saturday night. Look, we got a little loud, left a mess, I’m sorry about that. But we didn’t do anything like… what you’re saying.”His voice sounded genuine, but there was an edge to it, like he was hiding something. “What about a tarp?” I pressed. “My neighbor saw you carrying something heavy, wrapped up.”“A tarp? Oh, yeah, we had some camping gear we moved around. Tents, sleeping bags. That’s probably it.”I didn’t buy it, but I didn’t push further. “Okay. The police are involved now. They’ll probably call you.”“Police?” His voice spiked. “Look, we didn’t do anything wrong. I swear.”We hung up, and I sat there, staring at the leather book. The police came back with animal control, who removed the deer. I couldn’t watch, but I overheard them saying the deer were killed elsewhere, likely with a knife, then moved to the cabin. The cuts were clean, precise, not like an animal attack. I gave the officers the book, and Davis flipped through it, frowning. “Could be nothing,” he said. “Or some kind of weird ritual thing. We’ll send it to the station.”The investigation didn’t go far. The guests all denied knowing about the deer, and there was no physical evidence linking them to it. The book was just a curiosity—no fingerprints, no clear connection. Mrs. Johnson’s story about the tarp wasn’t enough to prove anything. The police closed the case, calling it a “disturbing prank” with no leads.I couldn’t go back to the cabin after that. The smell lingered in my mind, even after professionals cleaned the crawl space. Those deer, their staring eyes, haunted my dreams. The leather book, the tarp, Tom’s nervous laugh—it all swirled together, leaving me with questions I’d never answer. Was it a sick joke, or something darker, something planned? I sold the cabin a few months later, unable to set foot in it again. My sanctuary was gone, replaced by a shadow of fear that still follows me.

  


# ""The House Wasn't Empty"":

I needed a break from my hectic life, so I scrolled through Airbnb for a quiet escape. A small house in a sleepy town caught my eye. The listing showed a charming place with a wide backyard, a porch swing, and a living room with a brick fireplace. The reviews glowed with praise—guests loved the “homey vibe” and “peaceful setting.” I booked it for the weekend, imagining long hours with my books and a glass of wine.When I pulled up to the house, it looked like the photos, but the street felt eerie. The neighbor’s house across the road had plywood over the windows, and the lawn was overgrown with weeds. A rusty bike lay abandoned in the ditch. I shook off the unease, grabbed my suitcase, and found the key in a lockbox by the door. Inside, the house was dim. The air smelled sharp, like bleach mixed with something sour, almost chemical. I wrinkled my nose and cracked open the living room windows, letting in a breeze.The place was cozy but worn. The couch sagged in the middle, and the coffee table had deep scratches, like someone had dragged a knife across it. The carpet had faint brown stains near the edges, barely visible unless you looked closely. I told myself old houses have quirks and started unpacking. I set my books on the table, plugged in my phone, and made a cup of tea. As I sat down, a low thump echoed from somewhere below. I froze, teacup halfway to my mouth. Another thump followed, then a dragging sound, like something heavy sliding across a floor.I checked the Airbnb listing on my phone. No mention of a basement. I walked through the house, looking for answers. In the kitchen, behind a faded curtain, I found a door I hadn’t noticed. It was wooden, splintered, with a rusty padlock securing it. The noises seemed to come from there. My pulse quickened. Why was this locked? Why wasn’t it in the description? I pulled out my phone and messaged the host.“Hi, I just arrived. There’s a locked door in the kitchen. Is that a basement? I’m hearing noises from it.”The host replied within minutes: “No need to worry! That’s just a storage area. Old houses creak and groan. You’re perfectly safe.”The message felt too cheery, like a canned response. I stared at the door, the thumping growing faint but steady. I tried to distract myself by unpacking my clothes into the bedroom dresser. The drawers stuck, and one had a crumpled receipt inside, dated months ago, for a hardware store purchase—nails and a padlock. I frowned. Was this for the basement door?I went back to the living room and opened my book, but the noises kept pulling me away. Thump. Scrape. Thump. I turned on the TV, cranking the volume to mask the sounds, but my eyes kept darting to the kitchen. I felt watched, even though I was alone. I double-checked the front and back doors, making sure they were locked.That night, I climbed into bed, but sleep wouldn’t come. The house was too quiet between the basement noises, which now sounded deliberate, like someone moving furniture. Around midnight, I heard a new sound—footsteps crunching outside. I slipped out of bed and crept to the window, peeling back the curtain. In the backyard, a man stood under the porch light. He was thin, his face hidden by a hoodie. He stared at the house, hands in his pockets. My breath caught. I ducked below the sill, heart hammering. When I peeked again, he was gone.I didn’t sleep after that. I sat on the bed, phone in hand, debating whether to call the police. But what would I say? A man stood outside? It didn’t feel like enough. At dawn, I went to the backyard. The grass was damp, and there were footprints—deep, uneven, leading from the fence to the back door and back again. My stomach twisted. Someone had been right outside while I slept.I messaged the host again: “There was a man in the backyard last night. I found footprints by the door. What’s going on here?”The reply took an hour: “That’s strange. Probably a neighbor’s kid playing around. I’ll ask around. Keep the doors locked, and you’ll be fine.”The host’s casual tone made my skin crawl. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was hiding something. I grabbed my laptop and searched the house’s address online. After a few clicks, I found a local news article from last year. My blood ran cold. The house had been an Airbnb before, and police had raided it after neighbors reported “suspicious activity.” They found stolen goods—electronics, jewelry, even car parts—stashed in the basement. The renter at the time had no idea, thinking the noises were just “old house sounds.” The article mentioned the host claimed ignorance, but neighbors said strange people came and went at odd hours.I felt nauseous. Were the noises I heard someone hiding stolen goods? Was the man in the backyard part of it? I went to the kitchen and stared at the basement door. The padlock looked old, but the wood around it had fresh scratches, like someone had pried at it. I grabbed a flashlight from my car and shined it on the door. The scratches were deep, and there was a smudge of dirt on the handle, like a fingerprint.I called the host, my hands shaking.“Hello, this is the guest at your rental,” I said when he answered. “I’m hearing noises from the basement, and I saw a man in the backyard. There are footprints. I found an article about a police raid here last year. What’s going on?”His voice was smooth, almost rehearsed. “You’re letting your imagination run wild. That raid was ages ago. The basement’s empty, just old junk. I’ll check on the property tomorrow.”“Tomorrow?” I said, my voice rising. “I’m scared now. Can you come today?”“I’m out of town,” he said. “Lock the doors, stay calm. You’re safe.”I didn’t feel safe. I hung up and paced the living room. The noises started again—louder, more urgent, like someone stacking boxes. Thump. Scrape. Thump. I grabbed my keys, ready to leave, but I couldn’t stop staring at the basement door. What if someone was down there right now?Then I heard a click. I spun toward the kitchen. The basement door was ajar, the padlock on the floor, broken in half. My legs felt like jelly. I backed toward the front door, eyes glued to the kitchen. Footsteps creaked on the basement stairs—slow, deliberate. I fumbled with the front door lock, my fingers slipping. The footsteps grew louder, closer.I yanked the door open just as a man appeared at the top of the stairs. He was the same man from the backyard, his hoodie stained with grease. He held a duffel bag, heavy with something inside. His eyes locked on mine.“Hey, wait!” he yelled, stepping forward.I screamed and ran to my car, slamming the door and locking it. My hands shook as I jammed the key into the ignition. The man stood on the porch, watching me. I peeled out of the driveway, tires screeching, and didn’t stop until I reached a gas station a few miles away. I called the police, my voice trembling.“Someone’s in the house I’m renting,” I said. “He came from the basement. I think he broke in. There’s stolen stuff down there, I read about it.”The police told me to stay put. They went to the house and called me later. They found two men in the basement, surrounded by stolen goods—laptops, cameras, even a car stereo. The men had been using a crawlspace under the house to sneak in, thinking the place was empty between rentals. The host swore he didn’t know, but the police were skeptical. They said I was lucky to get out when I did.I drove home that day, my heart still racing. I deleted the Airbnb app and vowed never to rent again. I can’t forget the sound of those footsteps, the smell of that house, or the man’s eyes staring at me from the porch. I was supposed to find peace that weekend, but instead, I found fear I’ll never shake.

  


# ""Don’t Open the Door"":

I needed a break from the city, from the endless grind of work and noise. My friend Emily suggested we try an Airbnb for a change, something unique to help us unwind. We spent hours scrolling through listings until we found one that caught our eye: a small, rustic cabin nestled in a quiet rural area, surrounded by dense trees. The photos showed a cozy living room with a stone fireplace, a tidy kitchen with wooden cabinets, and a bedroom with a quilt-covered bed and a large window overlooking a meadow. The reviews were glowing, praising the host’s hospitality and the cabin’s charm. The host, a woman named Lisa, responded quickly to our questions, her messages warm and welcoming. The price was affordable, so we booked it for two nights, excited for a peaceful weekend.We arrived at the cabin in the late afternoon after a long drive. The dirt road leading to it was narrow, lined with overgrown bushes that scraped the sides of our car. The cabin looked just like the pictures, with weathered wooden walls and a slanted roof covered in moss. A single flowerpot sat by the front door, where Lisa had said we’d find the key. I lifted it, grabbed the cold metal key, and unlocked the door. It creaked loudly as we stepped inside, the sound echoing in the stillness.The air inside was thick and musty, like the cabin hadn’t been aired out in weeks. I wrinkled my nose but figured it was normal for an old place like this. The living room was inviting, with a worn leather couch, a knitted blanket draped over it, and a small TV on a wooden stand. A stack of dusty board games sat in the corner, untouched. The kitchen was just off the living room, its countertops clean but cluttered with odd items: a cracked ceramic mug, a half-empty jar of pickles, and a single fork lying on a dishtowel. I noticed a chair at the small dining table had a piece of rope loosely tied around its back, the ends frayed. It looked out of place, like someone had been messing with it.Emily chuckled, running her finger along the rope. “What’s this? Someone practicing for a cowboy audition?”I forced a smile, but my skin prickled. It was such a small thing, but it felt wrong. We decided to explore the rest of the cabin before unpacking. The bedroom was down a short hallway, simple but cozy, with a double bed covered in a faded quilt and a nightstand holding a lamp with a crooked shade. The large window let in soft light, showing a view of tall grass swaying in the meadow. But at the end of the hallway was another door, heavy and wooden, secured with a shiny padlock that looked newer than the rest of the cabin. I tried the handle, but it didn’t move.“Probably just storage,” Emily said, shrugging. “Or maybe Lisa’s secret wine cellar.”I laughed, but my unease grew. Lisa hadn’t mentioned a locked room in the listing or her messages. We returned to the living room, and I pushed the door from my mind. We unpacked our bags, and I started pulling out ingredients for dinner—pasta and sauce we’d brought from home. As I filled a pot with water, I heard a faint sound, like nails scratching against wood, coming from the direction of the locked door. I froze, the pot nearly slipping from my hands.“Emily, did you hear that?” I called, my voice sharper than I intended.She was arranging her clothes in the bedroom but poked her head out. “Hear what? You okay?”“It sounded like scratching, from that locked door in the hallway.”She walked over, her sneakers squeaking on the wooden floor. “Maybe it’s mice. Old cabins like this always have critters, right?”I nodded slowly, but my heart was beating faster. Mice didn’t explain the slow, deliberate sound I’d heard. We went back to making dinner, but I kept glancing at the hallway, half-expecting to see the door creak open. The water boiled, and we ate our pasta at the table, the rope-tied chair pushed aside. Emily chatted about her plans to hike nearby trails, but I could barely focus. The cabin felt too quiet, like it was watching us.After dinner, we washed the dishes, and Emily suggested we watch a movie to unwind. I agreed, hoping it would calm my nerves. We settled on the couch, the TV casting a flickering glow across the room. Halfway through the movie, I heard it again—scratch, scratch, scratch. Slow and rhythmic, unmistakable, coming from the locked door. My breath caught in my throat.“Emily,” I whispered, grabbing the remote to mute the TV. “You heard that, right?”Her eyes were wide, her body tense. “Yeah, I did. That’s not mice.”We sat in silence, staring at the hallway. The scratching stopped, replaced by a low, muffled thump, like something heavy being dragged across the floor. My hands shook as I set the remote down. “We need to check it out,” I said, my voice barely steady.“Are you crazy?” Emily hissed. “What if it’s... I don’t know, a raccoon or something worse?”“We can’t just sit here,” I said, standing up. I grabbed a flashlight from my bag, its beam cutting through the dim light. Emily followed reluctantly, clutching her phone. We crept down the hallway, the floorboards creaking under our weight. The padlock gleamed, cold and unyielding. I pressed my ear to the door, holding my breath. Nothing. But the silence felt alive, like someone was holding their breath on the other side.I knocked lightly. “Hello? Is anyone there?”No answer. Emily tugged my sleeve. “Let’s call Lisa. This is too weird.”I nodded and dialed Lisa’s number. She answered after a few rings, her voice bright. “Hi! How’s the cabin treating you?”“There’s a locked door in the hallway,” I said, trying to keep my voice calm. “We’re hearing noises—scratching, thumping. What’s in there?”A pause, longer than I liked. “Oh, that’s just the utility room,” she said, her cheerfulness fading. “Probably the water heater or some pipes acting up. Old cabins make all sorts of noises.”“Pipes don’t scratch,” I said, my grip tightening on the phone. “Can you come check it out?”“I’m actually out of town,” she admitted. “But I can send my brother to look tomorrow morning. Just ignore it for now, okay? You’re perfectly safe.”I didn’t feel safe. I hung up, relaying the conversation to Emily. Her face paled. “Her brother? Tomorrow? What are we supposed to do until then?”I didn’t have an answer. It was too late to drive to a hotel, and the nearest town was over an hour away. We decided to lock ourselves in the bedroom for the night. I dragged a chair from the kitchen—the one without the rope—and wedged it under the bedroom door handle. Emily watched, her arms crossed tightly. “This feels like a horror movie,” she muttered.We climbed into bed, keeping the lamp on. Emily fell asleep eventually, her breathing soft and steady, but I couldn’t close my eyes. The cabin was silent, but my mind raced, replaying the scratching, the thumping, Lisa’s vague answers. I stared at the ceiling, the shadows from the lamp stretching across it like fingers.Around 2 a.m., I heard a new sound—a soft, rhythmic tapping, like someone knocking gently on the locked door. I sat up, my heart hammering. The tapping grew louder, more urgent. I shook Emily awake. “Listen,” I whispered.Her eyes snapped open, and she clutched the blanket. “What is that?” she breathed.The tapping stopped, and for a moment, I thought it was over. Then came the worst sound yet—a faint, raspy voice, muffled behind the door, saying, “Help... please... let me out.”My blood turned to ice. Emily gasped, pulling the blanket to her chest. “Did you hear that?” she whispered, her voice trembling.I nodded, my mouth dry. Was someone trapped in there? Or was this a trick, someone luring us closer? My mind spun with possibilities, each one more terrifying than the last. I grabbed my phone to call the police, but the signal was gone. Emily checked hers—nothing. The cabin felt like a trap, closing in around us.“We need to leave,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “Right now.”Emily didn’t argue. We scrambled out of bed, throwing our clothes into our bags. My hands shook as I pulled on my shoes, the tapping starting again, louder now, like a fist pounding. I grabbed the flashlight, and we moved to the bedroom door. I removed the chair, my heart in my throat, and cracked the door open.The hallway was dark, the padlock glinting faintly. As we stepped out, the locked door rattled violently, like someone was slamming against it. A loud bang echoed, followed by another plea, “Please... open the door!” The voice was desperate, but it sent chills down my spine.We didn’t wait. We ran through the living room, past the rope-tied chair, and out the front door. The night air hit us as we threw our bags into the car. I fumbled with the keys, my hands shaking so badly I nearly dropped them. As I started the engine, I glanced at the cabin. A shadow moved behind the bedroom window, tall and human-shaped, watching us.I floored the gas, the car lurching down the dirt road. Emily kept looking back, her face pale. “What was that?” she said, her voice breaking. “Who was in there?”I didn’t answer. I just drove, checking the rearview mirror every few seconds, expecting to see headlights or that shadow chasing us. We didn’t stop until we reached a hotel in town, its neon sign a beacon in the darkness. The clerk gave us a room, and we locked the door behind us, collapsing onto the beds. My hands wouldn’t stop trembling.The next morning, I contacted Airbnb through the hotel’s Wi-Fi. I explained everything—the noises, the voice, the shadow. They promised to investigate and issued a full refund, but it felt hollow. Later that week, I searched online and found a local news article about the cabin. Lisa’s brother, who was supposed to “check” the place, had been living there, struggling with severe mental health issues. He’d been locked in that room, unknown to guests, because Lisa thought he was harmless. The article said he’d sometimes call out to guests, thinking they could free him. Lisa claimed she didn’t know he was there during our stay, but the police were looking into her story.That weekend was supposed to be a relaxing escape, but it became a nightmare I’ll never forget. The sound of that voice, the rattle of the door, the shadow in the window—they haunt me. I haven’t booked an Airbnb since, and I don’t think I ever will.

I’m currently on mat leave and returning to work in August. My husband will be taking parental leave for six months when I go back (we’re in Canada and splitting 18 months of parental leave).

We live in a very small one bedroom house with a loft. We sleep in the loft and our son has the main floor bedroom. I work fully remote and prior to becoming a mum, my WFH setup was in the living room. But now that my husband and son will be home everyday, I don’t think I can reasonably work in the living room. I can be in meetings anywhere from an hour to six hours a day. I’m in management, so sometimes those meetings are sensitive, and I can’t be disturbed. I’m also worried about my productivity and, in general, my ability to do my job well if I’m constantly distracted.

I asked my HR team if there was any way to pay for a desk rental at a nearby co-working space through our benefits, at least until my son goes to daycare in a few months, and they said the expense wasn’t eligible. Any tips from mums who’ve been in a similar position? Do I just try to juggle it all? Give up my ideal setup and try to work from a coffee shop? Thanks in advance!

ETA: The loft is unbearably hot, so we have a portable air conditioner that runs all summer. It’s so loud I wouldn’t be able to take any calls up there. The walls are also very slanted since it’s an attic space, so I don’t have anywhere to put a desk. Old houses ftw 🫠 ",1,1750556998.0,workingmoms,4,1.0,False

Mariah is one sneaky kickass go-all-day doctor who can haul all the stuff. So when someone gets killed, and one of your crew run off, she's clearly the one to call. So the crew goes from 3. To a 4th we never meet, down to 3...one of whom (the apprentice it seems) has run off.

""Oh shit. So if you're not the killer...."" and now there are 2.

But the second mechanic mission rolls around where The Same Guy has run away. Man that last mechanic must be a bitch because with just her there, she's still bullying poor old Jayson who it seems has talent she isn't prepared to open her eyes to. Well if she's a B - come camp with us and I'll see what you've got.

After a bit of work - wow - he's a pretty dedicated guy, former railroad engineer who can suck a bowling ball through a garden hose...in order to get fuel from the most wrecked of wrecks.... got a keen engineering eye, but can swing a hammer like nobody's business. And seeing we're in the land of the big screen at Knights Drive In - well my previous ""good"" mechanic who's superpower is ""helping to put a smile on everyones face"" with +4 morale? Jayson gets to tell her there's only enough room for 1 mechanic around here.

Hearing the call from his bitchy exboss and knowing where she always wanted to go, Jayson goes and kills a whole chain of plague hearts (all the ones on the map plus one more just to the south), and claim the coffee shop conveniently located between the workshop, and the fast food joint (which for once does not have a plague heart in it). He rests up. Then of course HE goes and helps start the generator.

""Man this is hard work with just a crew of one"" - but you know what? She's cranking out advanced tool kits and vehicle upgrade kits like you can't believe. She doesn't mind charging, though, it's really keeping us broke.

1lhcb5r,https://i.redd.it/fd0hg1maud8f1.jpeg,Lana Lang Fragmented prose.,"1.      Suppose I start here: I think I loved a secret more than I loved the boy who kept it. Or maybe the secret *was* the boy. Is that too simple? Suppose I admit this necklace – green, dense, faintly humming – became the locus of that confusion. Worn right here, between the collarbones. A bruise made permanent.

2.      Saw a science program once. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds formed through interstellar collisions. Imagine. Beauty born from celestial violence.

3.      I trace the edge with my nail. Again. A nervous habit, maybe Its resilience reminds me of certain silences.  The mineral stubbornness pressing lines into my skin.

4.      His earnestness, a fragile shield against… what? Did we even know then? Just boys and girls playing dress-up with emotions too big for us. The necklace felt like part of that costume. Necessary ballast.

5.      I remember pressing it hard against my skin sometimes. Feeling the coolness, then the warmth leaching from my own body into the stone. What was I trying to do? Absorb it? Understand it by touch? A small, stupid ritual against the larger unknowns.

6.      Reading mother’s diary felt like this, too. Pressing my face against the page, trying to inhale her handwriting. Was I trying to *be* her? Or just prove I existed outside the shadow of the crash? The necklace, fragment of that same fire, felt like evidence. Exhibit A: Girl Tethered to Tragedy. Its green glow, a sickly nightlight against the darkness of her absence.

7.      He smelled of sun and hay and something else. Something electric, unsettling. Like the air before a storm. *This time, Lana.* His eyes would plead. My pulse, a trapped bird against the stone.

8.      Suppose I admit it: my primary orientation is towards a piece of rock. I love blue, but the world seems to be saturated with green. A point of cold pressure just below my throat. Sometimes I forget it's there, until I shift wrong, or the chain catches, it suddenly catches against the ordinary fabric of the day. An inescapable weight.

9.       I read that Meteorites carry traces of amino acids. Building blocks of life. Here, they brought death. And this fragment I wore? It seemed to carry only the echo of his pain. A building block of distance. Is that life?

10.  Performance becomes second nature in a town like Smallville. The Smile. The Tilt of the Head. The Appropriate Level of Grief. The Necklace was part of that uniform. I remember catching its reflection in the window of the Talon, superimposed over my own face. Which was the mask?

11.   She catches me touching the stone again. A flicker in her stare—not judgment, just… always noticing. My thumb hides the green. But she’s already turning away. What did she see? A souvenir, or the scar; maybe just the chaotic green I wear.

12.   Are the hinges of my apartment made of glass?  The coffee shop was supposed to be a serene space. It’s more like diorama of my entrapment: I’m like both prisoner and exhibit, serving lattes in a cage dressed as a Nilotic sanctuary.

13.  Is it a sin to crave the texture of truth? Even if it's cold, sharp-edged? This stone doesn’t lie. Its green simply *is*. Unlike the shifting landscapes in people’s eyes, the careful architecture of their smiles. This weight, at least, feels constant. But maybe that’s the biggest lie of all – mistaking mineral silence for honesty. My own pathetic fallacy.

14.  Is it possible to get used to poison? A low dose, every day, until your body doesn't register the sickness, just the constant unease. Until the green glow feels like normal light.

15.  What do you do when the person you love causes you physical pain, just by being near what defines *you*?

16.  Paris had soft light. Grey stone that absorbed sound. Stood before Monet’s Nymphéas for an hour. All that blue felt like a different planet. Could barely remember the colour green. A lie, of course. You never forget the feel of the cage.

17.  Took it off. Placed it in a cedar box Nell had made years ago. The sudden lightness felt wrong. Like an amputation.

18.  People talk about scars fading. Does embedded radiation fade? Or does it just become part of your cellular makeup, indistinguishable from the self? You carry the source within. Removal doesn't guarantee decontamination.

19.  From the sky-fire that took them. My parents. And I wear it. Daily. Is this piety, or a kind of morbid map-making? An attempt to trace the coordinates of absence, right here, against my own skin.

20.  The Talon. My messy, imperfect try at something real. Coffee grounds on the floor, the clatter of mugs. Then Clark would walk in, and the air would thicken. The green stone, even tucked under my shirt, felt suddenly loud. A tuning fork for his evasions. He'd promise. *This time, Lana.* And the stone felt like a lie detector against my own pulse. Steady, knowing beat: *No.*

21.  Is memory just choosing which bruises to press on? Over and over...or am I? This one is—cool and green; perpetually tender.

22.  He once gave me a rare orchid. Perfect, waxy petals. Unreal. He said its particular shade reminded him of my eyes. I think it reminded him of the necklace. Something beautiful, cultivated, and containable. Something he could eventually own.

23.  I confess I have built a life around a piece of green stone. A shard collected from the wreckage. It rests against my sternum now, always cool. They say remember the those we lost.  Suppose I admitted that some days, the coldness of it feels less like memory, more like the core of the loneliness itself.

24.  The feeling of the chain, thin against the skin on my neck. Sometimes catching a strand of hair. A tiny, persistent irritation. A reminder.

25.  Sometimes, it’s just green. Dull jade in the shade. Other times, caught in a certain light, it seems to pulse. A faint, unhealthy viridescence leaking out. Like poison trying to pass as jewel. Like a secret held so tight it glows.

26.   A man out by Hob's Pond swore he saw lights fall the night of the shower. Said they hummed a tune. People called him crazy. Maybe. Or maybe just observant.

27.  Do memories attach themselves to objects? Or do objects become anchors for the storm inside? Pressing the cool green stone against my temple. Trying to still the thoughts. A futile exercise. Like trying to map fog.

 

28.  Authenticity? Tried to find it in textbooks, in relationships, in independence. Is it something you find? Or something you are granted?

29.  That hard, phosphorescent green. The color of this rock, yes. But also oscilloscope screens. Digital rain in *The Matrix*. An unnatural energy. A signal from somewhere else, disrupting everything.

30.  And Lex. He arrived with answers. Not truths, perhaps, but answers. Plausible surfaces. Explanations like smooth, cool stones skipping over the murky depths Clark navigated. Lex didn’t carry a secret like a burden; he wielded secrets like tools. Or weapons.

31.  Hold it up to the window on a rainy day. Does stone absorb sorrow? It just refracts the gray light, dense and mute. I read somewhere about rocks holding magnetic memory. Perhaps this piece remembers the fire, the speed, the impact. Maybe I touch it hoping for transmission. A jolt of clarity. Am I simply assigning narrative weight to a random piece of cosmic debris?

32.  Does the green fade? Or just seep deeper into the bloodstream? Still waiting for an answer.

33.  That necklace, that small green thing, made his proximity agony. Think about that. Love as proximity-induced pain. The green glow, the color of an impossible equation.

34.  A snag. The chain catches on the wool of my sweater. Just a tiny, routine friction. And suddenly: the linoleum floor of the hospital, the smell of antiseptic, the sticky green soap in the dispenser. *That* green. This stone didn't create the feeling, it just gave it a locus. Something tangible to wear around my neck, a portable memento of the moment the world cracked.

35.  To find oneself irrevocably altered. Choiceless. Defined by an event, carrying its physical remnant. Its muteness. That is the point, perhaps. A constant, quiet assertion of the rupture. Maybe this uncomfortable persistence is the closest thing to truth I possess.

36.  My fingers find it without thinking. Stress, uncertainty, a sudden chill—the familiar smooth shape; the outline of its mineral stubbornness.

37.  How to describe Lex’s control? Not chains. More like… altering the magnetic poles. So all your compasses point toward him. Even your own body, a traitor collaborating with the narrative he spun. Phantom life. Sickeningly precise.

38.  His pain. A physical thing. A barrier woven into the fabric of the town, the air, the necklace. My closeness was agony for him. Love measured in excruciating proximity. Green was the color of that impossible space between us.

39.  What is this compulsion to touch it? Trace its edges until my fingerprint smudges its surface? Not like wanting Clark, the heat of that. No. This is different. A desperate, almost geological curiosity. What would happen if I put it in my mouth? Let the cold strangeness dissolve on my tongue? The *wanting* is there- Is it a strange thought? To integrate it somehow. To understand its alien indifference from the inside out.

40.  To want truth so badly you’d tear the world apart for it. Then realize you might be tearing yourself apart instead.

41.  Trust erodes like sandstone. Faster here. Each lie, each evasion, not a hammer blow, but water dripping. Persistent. Inescapable. You wake up one day and the foundation is just… gone. Replaced by suspicion. That hard, watchful green.

42.  Is it perverse to miss the weight of it now? The certainty of that specific pain? At least it was a map. A known territory of hurt.

43.   He made the lies physical, undeniable. Cellular. Suddenly the necklace seemed like a childish token. A surface secret. Lex dealt in biological truths, rewritten realities. His deception wasn't a weight; it was an infection. The green I wore felt clean compared to that invisible violation.

44.  I took it off. Put it in a box. Felt like burying a part of myself. The part that waited. The part that believed, maybe, that truth was graspable, solid like stone. It’s more like a tear now than jade stone.

45.  Loneliness can make you mistake control for comfort. I know that now.

46.  Heavier than stone, the weight of what it represented. The unsaid. The perpetually deferred truth. You get used to carrying it, adjust your posture. Until one day you try to stand straight without it and find you’ve forgotten how.

47.  Am I just cataloging grievances? Polishing the stone of my own hurt? Perhaps. But understanding the shape of the cage is the first step, isn't it? Even if you can't find the key.

48.  Sometimes, I dream in green. Not the soft green of new leaves. The hard, phosphorescent green of trapped energy. Of things that fell from a great height and shattered everything. It doesn't fade. That color. It just finds new surfaces to stain.",12,1750556217.0,Smallville,3,0.88,False

\**October 23, 2132, 2016 CST. Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, JSC, Houston, Texas.\**

Sarah Oberman bounded up the steps towards the CAPCOM station, twisting her body to avoid FIDO as he ran up the stairs towards the primary flight desk. She slid into her chair and checked the new notification, immediately pulling up the Garrack's transmission.

Skimming the words, she let out a disappointed sigh and queued the intercom to Flight.

“Flight.” 

“Go ahead.” Taylor radioed back, pulling back from the screen he was engrossed in.

“Transmission from the Garrack was just them saying that they’re on their way back. They’re out of supplies.” Sarah responded.

Taylor sighed again, simply pressing a button to acknowledge her station. She sat back in her chair and cradled her head, keeping an eye on her screen as she did so. Messages from other ships flooded in, all asking for updates on the Mayweather situation. A few interesting messages had been catching her eye, usually from international crews docked aboard the Renaissance station, which were requesting clearance from the US government to rebuild and reactivate the ACC-011 Dracula or Spacial Experiment 1633.

“Flight.” she called out again, looking over the messages.

“Go ahead.”

“What’s the official statement on the repair and reactivation of the Dracula?” she sighed, already knowing the answer.

“The official statement on the Dracula repair is ‘we’re not doing that, stop asking.’” he sighed back, clearly rolling his eyes.

“Understood. Follow up; What’s Spacial Experiment 1633?” she asked, trying to look into the ship on the internal records.

“Oh, that’s probably the AC-00. That’s the Kirk.” he responded, voice slightly lifted at the idea of explaining new information.

“I can’t find it on the intranet. Is it in with the Navy?” 

“No, SX-1633 is the name for the project that turned the Armstrongs into combat carriers. If they’re asking about reactivating SX-1633, they mean reactivating the Kirk.” Taylor chuckled, again clearly shaking his head, “That won’t happen. Not only is she in orbit of Mars as essentially a museum, but she also never received the changes the Harker and Reynolds got. She might not even have slipspace drives anymore.”

“Ahh, understood. Thank you. I’ll get that going out.” Sarah nodded, shooting a thumbs-up back towards flight’s desk.

She quickly wrote up and sent out a generic email to all of the people asking for the reactivation of the spacecraft before leaning back in her chair and sighing slightly. She waved to the man down her row of computers to get his attention.

“Ring me if something comes in. I need to go get some tea.” she mumbled, getting a thumbs-up from the man after. She muttered a word of thanks before leaving her chair and heading down the steps towards the main exits, giving a quick nod to a passing man as they moved past each other. 

With almost zombie-like movement she made her way towards the lounge and its two drink machines. Grabbing a paper cup and a tea package, she could practically taste the drink before it was even made. It had been nearly fourteen hours since she had eaten and even longer since she had last slept, with the stress of the Mayweather’s situation keeping her from sleeping well, if at all.

Inserting the packet into the machine and placing the cup underneath it, she waited as the drink began to fill the small container. 

“Sarah.” a female voice called out from behind, seemingly just as tired as Sarah herself was.

“Jacquie.” she responded, grabbing the cup from the machine when it finished, heading towards the fridge to grab cream.

“How’s it going on the flight deck?” the woman asked, grabbing her own cup and coffee packet.

“It’s going, alright.” she grumbled, mixing her drink and leaning on a counter nearby, “How’s it in the sims?”

“Well, based on the last gyro readings you guys got, we’ve come to guess that the Mayweather’s been bisected. We’ll give more information when we can, but I think we’re looking at a dead crew and dead ship.” she sighed, shaking her head slightly.

“Christ. Any good news?” 

“None we have right now.” Jacquie grumbled with a shake of her head, “We’ve got UNITF personnel in simulators for some manual ship flying, but I think they’re training to recover bodies more than lifepods.”

Sarah’s expression dropped as she sealed on the lid of her cup, though her attention was quickly brought to a man entering the room. He wore a dark gray flightsuit, the UNITF patch on his shoulder, just under the American flag. He looked at the two women momentarily before coming closer.

“Do either of you know who the current on-shift CAPCOM is?” he asked, voice somewhat rushed. Jacquie quickly pointed to Sarah, who nodded lightly. “Perfect. I’ve got a transmission for you to send out, at least when you’re done your drink.”

“We can go right now.” she nodded, motioning towards the door that led into mission control. 

“See you later, Sarah.” Jacquie waved, taking her coffee and heading back into the simulator area.

“Later, Jax.” she nodded, leading the man into mission control. She was unsure if he had been in Mission Control before, and was willing to show him around, but the man seemed very intent on moving for the CAPCOM station.

They had barely made it halfway up the main stairway before Taylor waved them down and pointed at the man.

“Michael. I didn’t know you were back on planet.” he called out, leaning over his console and looking at the UNITF Man beside her.

“Only about a week now, and I’ve been in simulators ever since, I’m briefed on the situation, but I’ve got a recommendation for a signal to send out.” he stated, waiting for Sarah to enter the CAPCOM station before he did, “Feathers is doing great, by the way. Not single anymore.”

“Good to know.” Taylor nodded, sitting back down, “Sarah’s good, she can help you with whatever you need. Just run it by me after.”

“Alright, ‘Michael’, can you tell me what to send and where?” she asked, sitting down in her chair and turning to look at the man.

“Alright, using Renaissance’s deep space communications system, transmit this package to the IXS Enterprise, then tell them to transmit it on carrier wave one-six-two-two. Tell SETI to listen for directed communications afterwards please.” As he spoke, he pulled out a USB stick and handed it to the woman, “This might get us some deeper scans into the area, if the Ma’pris are willing to play ball.”

“You’re asking the Ma’pris? Not even the government was willing to do that.” she asked, scowling at the man with a furrowed brow.

“They don’t have as many friends as I do there.” He chuckled, standing up from leaning on her desk and heading back down the stairs, “Thank you, Ma’am.”

She waited for the man to leave before queuing her intercom again and holding the USB stick.

“Flight, CAPCOM.”

“Go ahead, Sarah.” Taylor responded with near excitement.

“That ‘Michael’ just asked me to transmit something to the Ma’pris.” she sighed, rolling the USB through her fingers, “Should I-”

“Oh yeah, send that. He’s got connections there.” 

She paused for a moment and looked at the back of the UNITF man as he disappeared through the door, shaking her head at the idea that one man had connections on Xalantun.

“Understood, transmitting package.” she nodded, plugging in the USB and setting up the transmission orders. Within minutes, the SETI relay had the pickup request and the package was on the way to the Enterprise, leaving a confused Sarah at her seat. She waited for a brief moment of quiet and calm on the intercom before hovering her hand above the button, but hesitating to press it.

After a moment, she pressed the button and muttered to Taylor in a meek and embarrassed voice, “Flight… Who was that?”

The man was almost incredulous in tone, immediately laughing and heading off his chair towards her, “What, you don’t know?”

“No. Truly. I didn’t start that long ago.” she stated sheepishly, clearly realizing she should have some idea who that was.

“That was Nomad number two.” Taylor chuckled, coming up beside her and leaning on her console, “That’s Frosty-boy.”

Her head snapped over to the man beside her, then back down to the path the Marine had left through.

“That’s Nomad two?” She hissed incredulously, keeping her tone low.

“The one and only.”

She paused slightly, thinking for a moment before lightly shaking her head and snorting somewhat.

“I guess I was expecting something different.” she giggled, shrugging slightly and pulling the USB out of its slot.

“The hell else were you expecting?” the man beside her snorted, taking the USB as she offered it to him.

“I don’t know… more soldier-esque?” she muttered, turning in the chair to face the man better, “Definitely taller. Maybe more scars.”

“Oh, they’re hidden under the flightsuit.” Taylor snorted, pocketing the USB stick and beginning to ascend to his station.

“Taller then.” she giggled, turning back to her station, “Flight, be advised, Garrack is again venting nitrogen to cool themselves.”

“Understood, CAPCOM. Until we get more actionable intel, tell them we can’t exactly do anything, however.” he sighed, already back on intercom, despite not being at his station.

So I'm (28M) financially stable. My mom (50F) is on a more fixed income, and I worry about her having a financial cushion if something goes wrong. To give us both peace of mind, about a year ago I added her as an authorized user to one of my credit cards.
When I gave it to her, we had a very serious, clear conversation. I told her this card was to be used for true emergencies only: a major car repair, an unexpected and urgent medical expense, a plumbing disaster at her house, etc. It was meant to be a safety net so she wouldn't have to worry. She completely agreed and thanked me.
Yesterday, I was looking over my credit card statement online and saw a string of charges from her card over the last month. They added up to about $250. The purchases were things like new decorative pillows from a home shopping channel, a subscription box for fancy coffee, and a few items from an online clothing boutique.
I'll admit, I saw red. To me, these are the exact opposite of emergencies. I called her up, and I was pretty frustrated from the start. I asked her why she was using the emergency card for shopping. I reminded her of the very specific agreement we had, and I told her that it felt like she broke my trust.
She got very quiet and then became defensive. She said I was being disrespectful and that she was fully planning on paying me back when her next social security check came in. She said she'd had a hard month and just wanted to buy a few nice things to cheer herself up, and that I was overreacting and making her feel like a charity case. The call ended with her saying she couldn't believe I would get angry at my own mother over such a small amount of money.
She's been giving me the cold shoulder since then, and my aunt texted me saying I need to learn to be more gracious. Now I'm starting to feel guilty and second-guess myself. I feel like my trust was broken, but everyone is making me feel like I was too harsh.
So am I AIO? Was I right to be angry, or did I overreact and handle this the wrong way?",1,1750556018.0,AmIOverreacting,19,0.6,False

In the first post, roughly 2-3 hours before my final exam, I unpacked my abuse of Concerta (54mg’s) leading up to that particular exam. I consumed a 54mg Concerta every 4 hours with minimal sleep or food. 

In short, I was an absolute wreck. I became consumed in loneliness and anxiety that broke me down to almost nothing. After handing in my answer sheet, I broke down in tears in front of the Professor while exiting the room. As I was a senior in college at the time I could not care less who saw me in this state and went to get cigarettes and coffee before returning to my apartment. Once I was alone, I opened Reddit and read all the shocked/alarmed comments on my post. It was as if I finally could see the chaos around me. I called my father (a medical doctor) and told him in brutal honesty that I am on the verge of losing my sanity. He patiently listened to my frantic rambling and only asked one question when I had nothing less to say: “Do you know how long I have been waiting for you to open up to me?” An hour long discussion with the person I dreaded disappointing most in life, became the most important call, which ultimately “saved” me that day. 

Somehow, by the grace of God, I passed the exam. Within a week of completing exams I was looking at a very concerned psychiatrist after a very uncomfortable, but truthful, confession of my abuse of medication. I started from muddied waters and no intention of planning a future, and decided that living like this means dying every single day. 

I am now steadily recovering from numerous psychological disorders, with professional assistance. I fell back in love with exercising and completed my first marathon in 5 years in May. I still have the mental bruises, as well as an assortment of physical scars ranging from thin blue lines to thick purple “marks” reminding me of the worst time of my life, but I do not only see that version of myself anymore. To be honest I do not even recognize that person anymore. 

To conclude my annual update on what was then, and what IS NOW, I hope someone will find my story and know that no matter how far gone you are or how alone you think you are, just open your mouth and cry for help. The medication is GOOD if you use as prescribed! It is BAD if you start abusing it without anyone else being aware of your personal issues. It will become UGLY without you even realizing it, and when you eventually do realize it, the damage has already been done.

Much love to this community. You guys played an immense role in my recovery. 

P.S. I apologize for the info dump, I just really felt like I wanted to share an update.

For context, I (f27) went on a dinner date with another person, let’s call her G (f27) after talking on hinge for a week. We’re both neurodivergent as well, so social dynamics were a bit different but we had some common interests like tv shows, music and view on things. 

I rock up to our date at 6:30 which goes until around 11. It’s a dinner date which turns into a walk and icecream. It’s winter here so it was cold. A few awkward silences as she was doing a lot of talking (and I was processing all the sensory stuff + her talking) and asking some great questions which made me feel inadequate in terms of asking questions back but she kept going with my answers. Some jokes here and there and afterwards it got late so I dropped her home. It was absolutely silent in the car bc I was so overwhelmed and just wanted to go home and be warm.

We got to her house and as she’s leaving she wished me well for a conference I had the next day and I said thanks and that it was nice to meet her. I wasn’t fully sure if we had a spark but enjoyed our conversation. I wanted to get coffee today and also apologised for the silence dropping her home (gave her context around it) which I said to her in a vm the next day when I found a moment. She’s left me on read for two days which I found to be very odd and a bit rude tbh.

I just feel like if there isn’t a spark or you don’t even want to hang around in each others lives it’s decency to say that. I’m more disappointed and frustrated than anything that this person chose a less respectful route. 

Any thoughts and/or advice would be helpful?",2,1750555873.0,LesbianActually,2,0.75,False

1lhc117,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhc117,New #1: Strandberg Jazz Salen,"I've had this for almost 2 weeks and I still can't believe how good it is. I traded 5 cheaper guitars and opened a credit account for it, but it's mine now. 

Insanely comfortable and the Strandberg neck instantly felt good to me. Weighs 5.5lbs which is insane to me coming from a 355 with Bigsby as my (now) #2. 

Sustain sustain sustain. Notes have bell like clarity but dirty sounds have some attitude. 

Thornbuckers sound great, though I am curious how a hotter bridge pickup would sound, but I want to play it stock a while longer to really give the Thornbucker 2 a fair shake. It doesn't really chug right now but I don't want to ruin the in between split sounds and clean tone this guitar has right now.

I'm a huge Strandberg fan now and I'm sure I'll get another at some point. I think people somehow don't talk about just how portable these things are even though it's a big talking point. I've been taking it to coffee shops with an interface and working on tracks on my laptop and it isn't ridiculous or in anyone's way.

\
(Worthy Satire) - In a breakthrough for parents who always dreamed of designing their child like a luxury car, a genetics startup has launched a revolutionary service that ranks embryos based on IQ, height, and facial symmetry -- finally merging science with the moral clarity of a used car dealership.\
\
""Our test lets parents pick the embryo most likely to be a tall, good-looking genius,"" said Dr. Gene Pushmore, founder of BetterBabiez Inc. ""We call it eugenics, but with a tech startup font.""\
\
For just $29,999.99 (with Klarna financing available), expectant parents can now swipe left or right on their own fertilized embryos -- discarding the underachievers before they even form a spinal cord.\
\
Critics have expressed concern over the ethical implications, but Pushmore is undeterred. ""Look, we're not playing God -- we're just helping Him out. Maybe giving Him a little UX upgrade.""\
\
The company plans to expand its offerings in 2026 to include rankings for ""humor potential,"" ""TikTok charisma,"" and ""ability to resist gluten."" A loyalty program will reward returning customers with bonus embryos and a free coffee.\
\
Meanwhile, rival companies are already working on in-womb SAT prep, while Meta is reportedly developing the Zuckling, a pre-coded child optimized for metaverse engagement.\
\
When asked what could go wrong, Pushmore laughed. ""Please. What's the worst that could happen--elitist baby cults, genetic caste systems, and a generation that can't cope unless they're 6'2"" and know calculus by age 5?""\
\
Experts warn this is just the beginning. ""Next they'll be ranking grandparents based on inheritance potential,"" one bioethicist noted, weeping into his last shred of optimism.\
