As I understood it, you should buy 600 units at the beginning of each month as that is at the base tariff. 

My situation is that in winter we use around 1200 units per month. Wife and I work from home so PCs, dishwshers, kettles and coffee machine run more than normal. Also pool pump. Each of us often shower twice a day because sport. Only us at home. 

In summer we use zero units because we have solar geyser and PV solar panels.

As you can probably tell from my post history I am planning to open a coffee shop next year. Hopefully by early 2025. There are a few commercial spaces for lease in Rogers Park that I have been eyeing, however the locations are more in the residential area rather than a busy street like where Common Cup or Charmers is located. I don’t want to give away the exact addresses however I will say there are some other businesses neighboring the commercial spaces (sorry for being vague, I just want to keep the specific location as private as possible selfishly). 

Just for more info that may help whether or not this would be beneficial to this area:
I want to make it centered on community. Focusing on fair wages for staff and hosting various events. Some ideas I have had so far for events include open mics, tarot readings, and a small market event for local artists to sell their merchandise within a brick and mortar location. While Rogers Park has many events for artists, I have yet to see a cafe that’s branching out a bit more with the type of events they do (in this neighborhood specifically). On top of all of that, I recognize it could be a good work opportunity for people who live up here that don’t have a car. I know that taking the L farther south to find a job can sometimes be taxing. I don’t want to include my entire pitch here, but I will answer any question in the comments. 

I guess what I’m asking is, would another coffee shop benefit Rogers Park? If so, what would you like to see in a new coffee shop that maybe others are not offering? ",0,1728424658.0,AskChicago,2,0.5,False

1fzbske,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1fzbske/the_space_between_names/,The space between names ,"So I know when you first start going by a new name there is an adjustment period where your sense of self remains attached to your dead name and you have to adjust to your chosen name. But has anyone else experienced the space between names where your sense of self has fully detached from your dead name but has not quite fully attached to your chosen name? 

I've been going by Alexis, Lexi for short, for 10.5 months now. I'm at the point where my dead name feels alien to me, which is nice, but my chosen name doesn't fully feel like mine yet either. There's still a sense of disconnection, particularly with the short version. It feels like my old existence is fully dissolved but my new existence hasn't finished forming yet so I just don't currently fully exist. It's a bizarre place to be. And I feel more connected to Alexis from an internal protective but more connected to Lexi from an external one.

I think part of the reason is because I do have two forms of my chosen name. I also think that the reason Alexis feels more internally connected then Lexi is because Alexis is what I use in most situations of self identification. Like if I'm giving my name for a coffee order or to pick up pizza or when I sign something I refer to myself as Alexis, so that form of my name is sticking faster as a self identifier. On the opposite side of this, it feels like other people are referring to me when they call my Lexi, but there is a greater disconnect when other people call me Alexis.

Lexi is what the majority of people in my life call me and I only refer to myself as Lexi in specific circumstances, usually when I'm being cute with a romantic partner. Like I was cuddling with my boyfriend earlier and he said he had to get up and I told him that's gonna be hard with a lump of Lexi stuck to his shoulder. And the only people who call me Alexis are my sister, her boyfriend, and my coworkers.

It's like Lexi is who I am to other people but Alexis is to I am to myself. They're both me but because I am still in the process of fully connecting to my chosen name there is a gap between the two that is proving very slow to close. My dead name didn't have a short form and I never went by a nickname before so I wonder if this maybe has nothing to do with it being a chosen name and is just a normal thing that people who a short version of their full first name experience?

Originally it was supposed to be temporary till I graduate college but still while being temporary I’ve never had this much stress.

I get loaded with other people work and I get headaches every day while living off of coffee.
I’m miserable every day for 9 hours and then go home and have about four hours to myself but most of the time it’s dreading the next day.

It wouldn’t make me want to ram my car on the side of the road. 

The whole entire aspect of my current job is what I hate too, I have no coworker I really get along with, every time someone talks to me I want to punch them, I barely have the time to do what I want, and I’m exhausted all the time. I wanted to start looking for other jobs but that’s a whole job in itself and I’m exhausted already. Is it pathetic to take this much of a pay cut from a job that actually sucks the life out of me?

I've worked in a coffee shop before, used to using commerical machines. 

I'm after 'instagram crema'. Ultra thick, rich, orange looking crema (a shot that's largely crema) that persists.

I'm trying to dial in Square Mile Red Brick with a single dose. 

For a single shot trying \~10g in: 18.8g out in 0:31sec (maybe slightly faster than that, the scales are a little bit vauge on the timing). 

I'm at grind '5' on the Sage Smart Grinder (down from 4 when the shot looked a little too long and was dripping a little midway through). 

- How do I get more crema?

- These beans were roasted on 11/09. are they past their best? what's the best range for freshness? does this play a big part in the amount of crema produced? 

I'm doing some light WDT with a standard pin tool, and tamping lightly rotating after for an even bed. 

- how can I do myself a favour and get pucks that knock out dry? 

- how do I reduce the slight 'spitting' and spray I get from the bambino towards the end of the shot?

Then I texted him: 'how was your day?' and he left me on delivered for days. I saw today that he read the message but didn't reply. I thought we could at least be friends. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to mess with anyone's relationship. It's just confusing that he reached out to me only to ghost me afterwards

I feel really shitty right now and would like to know what you think of this. I know this sounds stupid but do you think he didn't reply to my text because he thinks I'm ugly? and unattractive? is this most likely because of my looks? Or is it because he is taken? I understand if this sounds bad and I know I shouldn't care but I'm confused why he reached out in the first place. There was 0 possibility of us bumping into each other again. Also confused why he's still following me on instagram.",1,1728422367.0,relationship_advice,3,0.67,False

Heidenskee, My recollection of the night Juliund reawakened, for I was watching.  
-The Watcher

File begins:

The sun had set, but not a soul in Heidenskee saw it go. How could they have? The sky died, as the locals liked to say. Something foul turned the white clouds over, and they lay dead up in the stratus, bleeding out weeks of heavy rain.

""Mr. Clark,"" Alex whispered. ""Can I go upstairs?"" 

Mr. Clark looked at the boy fondly.

""It’ll be my gift to you. I’ll come check in an hour.""

""Thanks!"" he shouted, darting for the backdoor and up the stairs. Mr. Clark watched him go. He wondered if it was healthy behavior for a twelve year old boy.

""Never was the best at parenting.”

He poured himself a glass and relaxed in his armchair by the fire. On nights like this, where the sky seemed to open up and beat the ground with everything it had, nothing felt better than resting beneath a roof. A knock came unexpectedly at his door. A shadow fell over Mr. Clark’s face. “I should have known someone would come.”

""Who are you?"" Clark shouted. ""And what do you want?"" The knock began again, and this time, did not stop. Clark ran to his dark window and stood inches from the glass. The knocks continued but grew stronger and more irregular, shaking framed pictures that fell to the floor and shattered. Glasses lined in the back clinked together.

""Tavern’s closed!"" he shouted.

Clark took his lantern and grabbed the handle to his front door. He pulled the bolt from the door and bared his teeth. ""Tonight, so be it.”

Wind ripped through the shop. Mist rose around the figure in the doorway like a crashing black wave. He smelled sweet death. It was coming from it. A man with the beak of a bird, sticky with dried blood, and furious eyes that burned red. The two kept their distance.

“Shrike. To what do I owe this visit?”

Then it was only a man. It stretched its mouth into a wide smile framed with thin cold lips. “May I come in?”

“No.”

The smile grew colder. “This is no way to treat an old friend.”

“How did you find me?”

“Relax…Kenny.” 

Mr. Clark’s full name was Kennedy Clark. He could not disguise his rage when the thing called him Kenny. “Why are you here?” he spat.

It inhaled deeply. “I followed the smell...I'm afraid your house is not well.”

“For once, I agree with you: you’re on my doorstep.”

“Aw, don't make me pout. I came here to talk.”

Clark shook his head. “No, not today Shrike. Not ever.”

“Do not shut that door.” It hissed. “Let me in.""

Mr. Clark scowled. “Why should I?”

“You are in grave danger.” 

“I’m not afraid of you.”

“You don’t need to tell me that. I surely know you aren’t, but listen to me very carefully. You should be…” It paused to shiver. “*Terrified*.”

“How curious. Are you desperate? What do you want to swindle me out of?”

“Don’t mistake my passion for weakness. You have no idea what I am hinting at.”

Clark simply began to shut the door once more. Shrike let out a horrible scream. “If you dare ignore me-”

“*Shut up.”*

Its hateful eyes bored into Clark's, making no attempts to hide its malice. “If you ignore me, old man, I won't even need to kill you.”

For whatever reason, perhaps the way it pleaded, Mr. Clark seemed disturbed. “What are you suggesting?”

“Can you feel it? *The apocalypse?* It began at the edges. Slowly stealing worlds. Now it is surging. It will destroy us all.”

Mr. Clark did not waver. “How is that my problem?” he asked coldly.

“Your problem?” it hissed. *“You monster.”*

“The best way to avoid a demon's trickery is to never give it the chance. I’ve already heard enough about your so-called apocalypse.”

“I’m different now.”

“I noticed. The old you would have never begged for anything. I think that’s why I’m wasting my time on you, Shrike. This is embarrassing.”

“No. I’m not the same.”

“What in the hell is wrong with you. Maybe you’ve lost your mind?”

*“I have gone insane.”* it shouted. *“I died!”*

“...What?”

“Have you felt death? Felt it grab you?”

“But you can’t…die.” It screamed again, falling to its knees on the doorstep. “I can,” it shook. “There is nothing that can stop this. We will all die.”

“Stand up. What are you talking about?

Tears leaked from its black eyes. “I am not immortal.”

“You've told me.”

“Did you know?”

“Of course not.”

“But you gave it up all the same.”

“I could not bear to continue on a journey without an end.”

It remained silent for some time. “Will you please invite me inside?”

“I will give you one chance to convince me you are not as horrible as I recall. It will not be easy. You have been warned. Shrike…you may come in.”

The two walked inside the tavern in silence. When you enter the belly of a home, you expect to feel some warmth. This empty tavern was hauntingly lonely. It had a high, ribbed roof, and tables scattered like wreckage. The storm outside raged against the walls and they creaked ever so slightly. Clark lit a lamp.

“Find a seat.” Clark said, waving his hand around the room. “There's enough empty chairs and empty tables. I'll go get us a drink.”

Clark turned and left, leaving Shrike alone in the middle of the room. It chose a seat overlooking the street through a dirty window. Carefully, it removed its trench coat and lay it across the back of its chair. Then it smoothed its suit with shaking hands, checked its watch, and drummed its fingers across the table. Clark returned shortly holding two mugs. “This is whiskey.” The greying man took his own seat across from Shrike, and scrutinized the creature harshly.

“Do you worst.” he said. “I'll listen.”

“Thank you. I’ll cut straight to the point because I’m running low on time. What do you know about Death?”

Clark gripped his mug, but only shrugged. “Quite a lot. But I don’t think I know what you’re talking about exactly.”

“But what do you know about Death itself?”

“Death itself...” his voice trailed off. ""Death is a force of nature. What are you suggesting, that Death is some kind of God?”

“Death is real.” Clark almost laughed. “You knock on my door...unwelcomed...to talk about fairytales.”

“Look at me,” said Shrike, leaning into the table. “Look at my face. Can you see how serious I am?”

“Fine. You are a fantastic liar.”

“I meant it. Look at me.” 

Clark leaned back. “I can see you just fine.” 

“I'm serious Clark, look at me.” Clark stared.

""I died.”

“So you say.” Clark waved his hands. “But I can see you here. Don’t play with me.”

“I am alive for no more than an hour.” It checked its watch. “No, even less. I am running out of time.”

Clark watched him closely. “You tell a good story, but I don’t have the patience for this.”

“How long have you known me? I was brought back from the dead.”

“That's quite literally impossible.”

“No. Almost impossible.”

“I'll need an explanation. Tell me exactly what happened. And if you are planning to lie? Save yourself the time and get out.”

“A week ago I felt a presence like no other in the outer ring. I spent days drifting through the void, trying to catch a glimpse. I landed on the white comet Epson. There I found something I never expected. The birthplace of a god.”

“That was Death?”

“No, something else. It wanted to destroy me, I knew it instinctually. I tried to escape, but I couldn’t.”

Shrike gripped the edges of the table so hard they splintered. Its breathing was shallower, and sweat rolled down its face. “Then I died.”

Clark looked amazed. “You make it sound so simple.”

“It was not a simple death.” it muttered darkly. “I fought like an animal. I thought, maybe I have a chance. Then it got bored and killed me.”

Mr. Clark raised his hand. “Forgive me for interrupting. You said you died. But here you are. So how did you come back…from the grasp of death that I’ve never known to let go. In all my years of learning.”

“I am not finished. When I died, that mysterious figure appeared to me. Said that he wanted to talk. It was Death. He led me to the afterlife and it was beautiful. An endless field of tall grass and a cool breeze. He told me I would wander around these fields until my soul gently fell apart like sand. It felt like home. But Death was afraid. I stopped him, told him to tell me what was wrong. And then he gave me a choice. I could choose to wander these fields and maybe it would be forever, maybe Death could find another hero. Or I could choose to return to my body. It would be painful, he said. The most painful thing that Death knew existed. It would be so painful that my body would fail and I would die again. I had an hour, he told me. And if I left the fields I could never return. My second death would destroy me completely and it would be like I had never lived at all.”

It began to laugh. “And I gave it all up. I may never get to the afterlife...but you can. Everyone else can. At least now I'll do something good in my life.""

Clark mulled over what Shrike had told him. “Even if that were possible, which, *it is not,* why would I believe you?”

The Shrike unclipped its wristwatch and handed it to Clark.

“What is this?” Clark asked, without bothering to take it. “Why is the time so wrong? Is it broken?”

“No. It tells me how much longer I have to live. I die when it’s made a full revolution.”

“Who gave you it?”

“Death did.”

“Enough. You can leave.”

Shrike grinned. “You invited me inside.”

“You won’t come back for a long time when I kill you. I can promise you that.”

“You can’t really kill me, Kenny. I’ve already died. So why would I care? Hold my watch.”

“Why? What’s the point.”

“It’s intensely potent, and quiet. Once you touch it you’ll feel it down to your bones. You’ll know I’m telling the truth.”

“Do you know why I'm here?” Clark raised his voice to ask. “In this shitty town? To get old and die.”

“I understand,” the demon assured him. “And I never understood before. When you're alive, it's so hard to let go. I always though you had lost your mind and now I've lost mine too.”

“You don't understand anything.” Clark muttered darkly. He grabbed the watch. “Careful-” Shrike began, but Clark hushed him. He slipped the watch onto his wrist, and stared at it hard.

“What do you feel?” the Shrike asked. Wordlessly, Clark handed it back. “What did it say?” Shrike asked again.

Clark sat in contemplative silenced. He sipped on his drink slowly. After almost a minute, he sighed deeply. “Can you prove it to me?”

“Prove that I'm dead? That I met Death? That I have under an hour to save the world?”

“Try that.” “Well I can't. I already told you my story. Do you believe me?”

Clark would not answer, he only sipped his coffee darkly.

“You've got to believe me-”

Clark raised his hand to silence the Shrike, casting a wavy shadow across its face. “I hear something. Who is that?” Clark asked. “Shrike, did you invite a friend?”

There was another knock.

""Who is at my door?”

""The police.”

""What?”

The demon could not look Clark in the eyes. 

""Listen you fucking parakeet, if you’re trying to get me arrested in my retirement I won’t just kill you, I’ll…”

It was shaking slightly. Then it looked back up, and Clark could see him grinning like a cat. It laughed so hard it doubled over in it’s chair.

“I KNEW YOU WOULDN’T LISTEN TO ME.” it shrieked. “I’m sorry it had to come to this, *Juliund,* but your life of crime is over.”

Mr. Clark frowned and walked quickly across the floor. He opened the door with a fake smile plastered across his face. “What can I do for you…?”

Mr. Dupont was a weathered man. His greying hair was slicked, exposing the scars that marred his face, and the heavy weight of experience.

“Name?”

Clark scowled. “Kennedy.”

“Kennedy Clark?”

“The very one. Can I help you officer?”

The man held a wet cigarette in his fingers. The rain pushed his soaked grey hair over his eyes but they smoldered anyway.

“You’re under arrest on behalf of the Empire."" The man flashed his silver badge. “I am with the Eldora Military Police. They ordered your immediate detainment until further questioning.”

Clark was really quiet. “I see.” He looked the man up and down slowly. “A single officer, sent to arrest a fugative of the Empire. They must have a lot of faith in you.” Then he chuckled. “Just an old man’s humor. Come inside, Freddy.”

“Frederic.” he snapped. “But…” his voice trailed off.

Mr. Clark loomed in the entrance. “I know the feeling. Please, come inside.”

They took a seat at the same table. Shrike and Mr. Dupont stared down Mr. Clark, who sat across from them.

“So, you’re going to arrest me?” he finally asked.

“What do you think he wants? Coffee and donuts?”

Mr. Dupont held up his hand. “Don’t get ahead of yourself. Shrike has conditions that I have been ordered to allow.”

“This is a new low for Eldora.”

“He simply asked to speak with you privately after I arrived. The Empire asked that we allow him to do so.” Mr. Dupont stood up and stepped aside. “This is not an opportunity to escape, Kennedy Clark. Your tavern is surrounded on every side. Don’t be foolish.”

After he was far away, it leaned in. “You’re not strong enough to escape alone.”

Mr. Clark scowled. “That’s what you say.”

“Because it’s true. You’ll never escape Heidenskee alive. Unless the two of us fight together.”

“Interesting.” He leaned back in his seat. “So what do you want from me? I knew you were trying to swindle me out of something the moment you knocked on my door. So don’t be shy, what do you want?”

“Search yourself, Kenny. You’ve known the answer for years.”

“What...no...”

”We must sacrifice your child.”

Mr. Clark choked back a cry. “My son?”

“There is no price too high-” *“Don't you dare play hero.”*

“One life...for every life. Every child and their parents. Every monster and every demon.”

“I will give you ten seconds to leave. Before I drag your corpse out of my house.”

“I knew it would be this way.”

“I SAID GO.”

“But I brought company.”

“You could bring all of hell to my front door but you better be ready to go back with them.”

“Very well then. Since you won't cooperate.” He stood up quickly.

“I'll kill you for this.”

“I know.” it said simply. Then it stepped aside. “Officer, you may proceed.”

Mr. Dupont stepped up with his hand on his belt and another holding a pair of glowing handcuffs. “Hands behind your back, face the wall.”

Mr. Clark did not move. Instead, he spoke softly. “Is this justice?”

“You have three seconds.” Mr. Dupont warned him.

“I have a son, officer. The moment you put those around my wrist, Shrike will go kill him. So I ask you again. Is this justice?”

“What?” Mr. Dupont muttered. “I know you have an adopted son. I was briefed on that. We’ll be leaving him under the care of the Empire, where he’ll grow up under the law. I will escort your son free of harm, you have my word.”

“No. Freddie, this was not our deal. I will be escorting his son to the Empire.”

The officer's eyes widened. “Why does it matter who escorts his son?”

“A deal is a deal.”

“Please Mr. Clark, clam down, there must be a misunderstanding-”

“There has been no misunderstanding!” Shrike shouted. “I need that child. Anyone who gets in my way will be destroyed.”

Clark faced Shrike. His eyes glowed yellow. “There is nothing in this damn world more important to me than my son.”

“HE IS A MONSTER.”

“Aren't we all?”

Shrike screamed and ran at Mr. Clark with its claws extended. Its suit ripped at every seam and the bits of cloth became black feathers. “I will kill your cursed child, Juliund!”

Mr. Clark's eyes were now blazing yellow suns. The two met in the middle of the room and the impact sent a ripple that flipped the table and threw Officer Dupont across the room and into the wall. Light fixtures shattered and glass bottles exploded. *“You bastard.”* the shrike screamed. He grabbed Mr. Clark by the throat and slammed him to the floor. *“You think you’re  better than me?”* Mr. Clark tried to respond but he only choked on his own blood. The Shrike wasted no time in peeling him off the floor and smashing him back down again. *“Just because you won't kill anymore? Does that make you a hero?”*

Across the room, officer Dupont was beginning to stir. His eyes flickered open in time to watch Shrike grab a chair and smash it mercilessly into Clark's face. The pressure in the room continued to build. Even the officer could feel it. It was as wet as humidity, or as obvious as wind. It hummed like a motor, growing louder by the second.

*“You are disgusting. Selfish. I will not regret taking your life.”*

Shrike took the shattered leg of the chair and impaled Clark's left arm, and then his right. He was pinned like a bug to the floor. Mr. Dupont heard Mr. Clark's awful inhuman screams and shivered in fear. Shrike raised the longest wooden leg and lined it up with his heart. *“Die.”* it said, plunging the stake down. It was a this moment that the static equalized into a perfect hum. Like a radio flipping through stations, then landing on the right one. Clark grabbed the the stake with one hand, stopping it instantly, and grabbed Shrike's neck with the other.

He grinned but his teeth were too sharp. “You've awakened something inside me, Shrike.”

It was simply silent.

“Don't beg for mercy.” Clark ripped his arms from the stakes pinning him to the floor and threw Shrike across the room. The change in his posture was obvious. His old age dissolved and left a grinning predator in its place.

“You’re evil…” it choked.

“QUIET.” Clark roared. His voice echoed around the room too long, the officer thought. Shrike just watched, clutching the edge of a flipped table with its fingers.

“He'll kill you,” it whispered. “Your “son” will kill you, don't you know?”

“I don't care.”

It clawed at its face. “What is wrong with you!” it cried in anguish. “You will die, avatar. Juliund, you are not invincible either. The boy will reach you too.

“My ways are beyond your understanding.”

“THEY ARE,” it screeched. “YOUR BELOVED “SON” WILL BETRAY YOU.”

Tears flowed down Mr. Clark’s beaten face. “Perhaps you are right. But that changes nothing.”

The Shrike howled as if it was on fire. He turned his attention to the Deputy, who stood on the perimeter completely enthralled and equally horrified.

“I am afraid I cannot leave with you tonight. I remembered that I have a son to protect. And I cannot let you leave here, either.” Clark shuffled his swollen feet, closing in on the cornered deputy. His eyes glowed yellow, set in dark circlet sinkholes. The veins in his neck and arms throbbed. Freddie Dupont fumbled for his gun.

“I'll never let you leave this room” he shouted, outstretching his trembling hand with a finger held to the trigger. One shot. Clark stumbled back. Another shot. Clark fell back, gushing blood. The third shot. All three punctured his gut, and the old man was knocked unconscious in a pool of his own tainted blood. Shrike had straightened up and and wasted no time. “Help!” he screamed in the voice of Mr. Clark. Mr. Dupont stared at it with a look of horror. “Help me!”

The backdoor swung open and a young boy stumbled out. He looked at the bird thing, and then to the dying body of Mr. Clark. He let out a strangled scream and slammed the door shut. It flew across the room to the door and rammed into it, yanking the locked handle and screeching with impatience. It began to claw at the wood of the door, blending it into a pulp.

“I'll get the boy. You finish the avatar.” it ordered.

Mr. Dupont watched as the door was ripped to pieces. He looked at the man he had shot three times, and then at the walls, staring off into the distance. “He's only a boy.”

“Does it matter?” it screamed as it dug into the door. The detective turned his gun and pointed it at Shrike.

“Yes. Because I’ve got some damned morals, so it *does* matter.”

Then he fired into the thing’s back. Its body went rigid and its bloodless body collapsed to the floor. Freddie held the transmitter button on his radio with shaking hands. “I need immediate backup. Bring an ambulance.”

1fzavq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fzavq9/weekend_plans_ruined/,Weekend plans ruined..,"AITAH?? I'm turning to the internet because although my friends and family are on my side, I'd still like to see if anyone has a different perspective and not just be biased.

Okay so I've been talking to this guy for 3 months now and we've been officially dating for 1.5 months. Were gonna call him John (28M). Everything was great, like as crazy as it sounds I (24F) actually fell hard for this guy within this time frame. So early on when we first started talking in July I told him about a concert in October and he agreed to go with me. It was a stretch because who knew if wed actually make it to October, but we did and everything was great. 

So fast forward to the week of the concert happening on a Saturday. Original plan was that I'd go stay over at his place since Thursday evening. I still live with my mom and she had been mad that I've been spending too much time with him and ""moving too fast"" with this guy. I understood her concern and told him about it and he said he understood where she was coming from. So new plan was that he'd pick me up after work on Friday and we'd drive over on Saturday afternoon to a town 3hrs away for the Saturday concert. 

John had moved into a new apartment recently and was still gathering things to fill the space up. My aunt happened to call me on Wednesday and asked if I knew anyone that needed a dining table so I said yes let me ask John. John liked the table and we planned on picking up the dining table on Thursday. On Wednesday he had stayed over and in the morning when he left he locked the front gate. It went over my head to tell him not to do that since my mom is the only one to have a key for it. I had no where to go after work, but now we had to wait for my mom to get back home from work until 8PM to pick up the table. Mother gets home and she jokingly said ""I hope you washed the dishes since you're so eager to spend time with this man"". Since my mom had a stern face when saying it, I took it as her being mad. John was pulling in but I told him ""No lets just go pick up the table, my mom is moody over the fact that I didn't wash 3 cups and 2 plates that are in the sink"". He scolded me over it but I just brushed it off as mother being dramatic. **For context:** I had told John that my mom often gets mad at me for not cleaning the house EVERYDAY. I get it, I'm living in her home, but cleaning a big house everyday is not 100% necessary in my opinion. I'll rather clean it thoroughly once a week.

We got the table, we set it up at his apartment and everything was adorable on that Thursday night. We had some coffee on the dining table and even said ""if this is how life is gonna be when were married, it'll be nice"". SORRY LOTS OF BACKGROUND INFO but I think it's important. Since we had agreed I couldn't stay over at his on Thursday and well I had work Friday morning, he dropped me off at home at around 2AM and he even said ""ill see you later"". I had previously stayed over his place but we could never enjoy sleeping in together since we both had work early in the morning. So both of us were looking forward to the weekend for this reason (maybe a bit cringe but we were genuinely excited). 

  
So now Friday is here and I knew that I had to clean the house and do other little things in preparation for the trip. I was gonna clock out of work at 12PM and mother wouldn't get home until 8PM, so I had plenty of time to clean the house and get everything situated. When I clocked out I was texting John that before I start doing all my chores I'd have something to eat. A couple minutes later, a friend invites me to get some lunch. I agree and I tell John about this and this is when it all starts going downhill. 

  
John starts going off about how I won't have time to do all my chores and how my mom is gonna be mad if she doesn't find the house clean when she gets home. I reassured him that ill have plenty of time and that there's nothing to worry about. He says ""this is why mother gets on you"". I kept telling him ""babe I'll have it all done, just trust me."" John says ""fine, but I'll be picking you up Saturday morning. I don't need your mom mad at me because I'm taking you away from something you need to do."" after this I still tried convincing him that id be done with it all, but he didn't budge because apparently he didn't want to be stressing over it. I start getting annoyed because dude... just believe me and lets go through with the plans we had, so I just tell him ""okay okay fair, fine I'll see you tomorrow(meaning Saturday morning) wtvr"". 

3 hours later I receive a message from John saying ""Hey. I don't feel like going anymore. start looking for someone else to go with"". At this point I had just finished bathing my dog and all I had left to do was pack for the trip. I reply ""are you done with work so we can talk on the phone"" and he wasn't. So I say ""call me when you're done"", to which he replies ""for?"" At this point I was getting more irritated that all the plans we had were just falling through, so I just said ""You know what nothing, I'll see who wants to go"". But me being me I couldn't just give up and wanted to still discuss this because how do we go from having such a lovely time the night before to this??? So we start discussing it over text (something I didn't want to do because we've had misunderstandings through text before, but I wanted to fix it as soon as possible). 

Long story short, he said that I was having an attitude about the whole cleaning thing after he brought up my mom being mad and how he didn't want to be on her bad side. I reassured him that I finished everything I had to do, so since that is what appeared to be his main concern I ask ""So what's happening? Are you still picking me up until tomorrow? Are we not going?"" and he says ""Im not going. I don't like how you dont take some things seriously, no matter how big or small it is (he's referring to the 3 cups and plates I didnt wash a couple days prior) You just laugh it off and then think everything is okay and it's not okay and like I said im not going to deal with it"". By this point I was defeated and didn't see any reason on continuing the conversation so I simply said ""okay"". 

  
3 hours later (it was already 6PM on friday by then) I ask to talk over the phone because why would we cancel our plans over something so petty? We talked and didn't really reach an agreement. I listed the concert tickets and they sold almost immediately so the concert was out of the question but I knew he had booked a room so maybe we could still make the best of it. I was still thinking he'd pick me up friday since I cleaned the house and I was good to go, but no he didn't say anything like ""well we can still go"". After all that my head was pounding so I decided to lay down and try going to sleep. I told him thats what I'd be doing and he said ""sure you are but okay"". I did intend on going to sleep but I ranted to my friends and they all agreed that he was being unreasonable and mean for no reason. They convinced me to go out and well I got drunk. I got home around 3am and I drunk called him wanting to talk it out or fix it, but instead this just made matters worse. 

John said ""why not instead of going out, you came to see me?"" A while back he had said something around the lines of ""I'm not gonna go somewhere I'm not invited"" so I told him that same thing and he said no this is different. BUT HOW? I apologized to him Saturday evening and that me going out was maybe bit too much (but looking back at it, I had nothing planned anyways since he canceled on me, so could he really get mad at me?) Anyways yeah this post is fairly long but we broke up. I am still a bit in shock because everything was great, but I guess the whole **3 month rule** proving to be true. Even after all that I still wanted to fix things and I even told him ""I'm the one that has been reaching out to you to fix all this and you were just nonchalant about the whole thing"". 

  
So AITAH? His whole argument was that I don't listen to what I'm told to do, and that ""my actions have consequences"".

I will be having a wedding ceremony from 10a-11am at a city hall, lunch will be 12-3pm. The lunch reception is about 2 miles/10 minute drive from the ceremony venue. The wedding ceremony cannot be done earlier or later as there are only two time slots per day (mid morning or mid afternoon). This leaves me with a rather weird 1 hour gap. It's too little to do something but too long to go straight to lunch. 

  
I was thinking about a mobile coffee vendor to serve warm drinks for about an hour outside city hall to help fill this gap as we mingle and talk for a little bit before making our ways over to lunch (pending clearance). Anyone else have any other ideas I could possibly look into as a contingency plan?

  
I had wanted to charter a trolley or two to take our guests for a spin around the city and then drop them off at lunch but it was a 4 hour minimum commitment. ",3,1728422025.0,weddingplanning,3,1.0,False

I’m gearing up for a 24-hour ambulatory EEG that’s scheduled for tomorrow and am looking for advice on safe ways to potentially trigger a focal seizure while at home. 

I’ll be in a relatively controlled environment, mostly in bed or on my sofa with another adult present. I’m supposed to start my period in a day or two and the test is tomorrow. I already had a seizure last night, and I didn’t sleep well, so I feel like I may have a good chance of actually catching something on this EEG.

Questions:

1.	Are there any safe activities, foods, or drinks you’ve found that have triggered focal seizures? I’m already planning to possibly have one cup of coffee and maybe do a brief workout when I get back from getting the EEG equipment put on (if I can). I may also try sensory overload/stress. Any other ideas?

2.	Video Camera Experience: For those who’ve had an ambulatory EEG with video, what was your experience like? Could you turn off the camera to use the restroom? Could you see your EEG activity or any technician notes on the monitor they send home with you?

3.	Other Tips: Any general advice for staying comfortable, protecting the electrodes/wires while sleeping, etc.?

1fzam23,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fzam23/help_with_financial_gap/,Help with financial gap,"My wife (29f) and I (27m) just had our second child. We now have a 22 month old and a 1 month old. My wife got a disability policy to help cover expenses while she is on maternity leave. The policy only covered 6 weeks for her and was a one time lump sum payout. She is returning to work in about 2 weeks but we will be short at least 1-2 of her paychecks until she gets back in line with payroll after returning to work. 

Would it be ill advised to get a small personal loan to cover bills for what we would have gotten if she had stayed at work?

Background:

 I make 66k annually with the opportunity for 30hrs of OT (paid at 1.5x) per week available, so long as I don't mind not seeing my family. I work 2pm-11:45pm normally and can work late or go in early as often as I want to. 

My wife makes approx 70k annually with additional monthly 'commission bonuses' that vary between $500 and $1500 per month. We try not to factor in the commission checks into our budget as they vary too much to be reliable. She has no opportunity for OT.

Both of our children are/will be attending day care 5 min away from my wife's place of work. Total outgoing cost for both children in the daycare is $1,000/week.

We have tried over and over to make a savings without compromising our standard of living, and each time we get a decent chunk, shit hits the fan and we have to use it all. First time was because an old daycare canceled on us and we had to find something last minute. Second time was emergency home repairs from our front porch stairs crumbling. Third was a flood in the basement and needed immediate remediation. Fourth was taxes. Fifth was emergency dental work. We're at next to zero in our savings because life keeps happening. 



We make enough together combined with me working occasional overtime to be successful and have positive income, but for the last 4 years we have essentially been paycheck to paycheck and never able to get ahead of the game. With sending our second child to daycare I have to work a minimum of 12 hours of OT per week to maintain our current standard of living.

All of our needs are met and we are moderately comfortable to the point where it's not an issue to get a coffee every few days as a treat but we definitely aren't in the Fancy Dinner every night demographic either. 

I am as diligent as I can be with our finances and have never missed a payment or been late on a payment. My wife had some money management trouble before we met where a credit card got canceled and a car got repossessed. After we met I took over her finances to help and we have successfully built her credit from 480 to 690. Mine is around 630 as most things are in my name except for her car,  and a credit builder account through a local credit union. 




Debts:

195k - House - $1,900/mo
30k - Car 1 (Mine) - $587/mo
30k - Car 2 (wife) - $583/mo
5k - Credit Card- $300/mo
10k - student loans - $200/mo
18.5k - Home repairs loans - $300/mo

Daycare - $4,000-$5,000/mo
Groceries/utilities/gas/pets/misc is all paid for with whatever we have left over.


When we stick to the budget I have worked out we are able to save roughly $1000 a month which is now going to go towards daycare and I will work additional overtime to provide for our ""frivolous expenses"".



Here's my question:

It's now the beginning of the month and with my wife not getting paid because of maternity we are in a bind. My check this pay cycle will cover the mortgage but that's it. There's still day care that comes out every Monday, and all of the rest of the bills for the month. My next check in two weeks will cover the cars and misc bills but won't cover day care, and my wife won't get paid this month. 

Is it ill advised to get a personal loan to help cover costs until she returns to work and gets her paychecks again? Possibly would also be able to consolidate the home loans and credit card debt into one loan as well. I have never missed a payment and don't want to start now 

Any advice is appreciated, I'm hanging on by a thread here. Also not sure when to bring this up to the wife as she has severe financial insecurity and assumes we are irrevocably doomed by even being close with money like this, and thinks we are mere days away from losing our house and living on the street",0,1728421540.0,personalfinance,7,0.5,False

And now, I can handle around 2 moka pot shots and it even makes me feel better with adjusting to the local altitude (at the very first days i felt like fainting until I decided to give caffeine a try), like a very steady rise of energy compared to what I've had at the sea level where I would have an instant rise and and instand drop.

 Does caffeine really help in higher altitudes, like does it have to do something with the blood circulation? And should I drink caffeine at the first place in that type of altitude? Is it helpful somehow? If you know any medical research on that pls share",2,1728421505.0,Biohackers,3,1.0,False

So, as a barista at Starbucks, I realized making perfect lattes is basically the same as coding. After whipping up some cappuccinos, I’m confident that emulating the GameCube on a smart fridge is just a few steps away. I recently played Wind Waker on my microwave and it got me thinking… fk.

I’ve already got Visual Studio Code installed on the fridge, and I’ve written some code. Haven’t tested it yet, but once I finish my shift, I’ll be booting into Melee on my fridge door. I’ll post a video of me playing before the ice cubes are done.

Here’s the blueprint: the user interface will be a touchscreen resembling the GameCube start menu. I’m also working on a feature to sync your Nintendo account with the fridge, so you can download games while you’re grabbing milk. Don’t worry, it’s totally secure—I’ll hack Nintendo’s servers later this week.

AI tools like ChatGPT have been guiding me through, and without them, I’d still be staring at my coffee grinder. I’ll set up a GitHub repo as soon as I figure out how to push code. Copilot’s got my back for that.

Let me know if you have any suggestions for fridge-based emulation. I’ll do Wii U after this.

I come from a background in literature/translation 😭

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hi everyone! A few days ago [I asked for help finishing my challenge list](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSimsBuilding/comments/1fx1sxq/help_im_writing_a_30day_tiny_house_build/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and after some amazing suggestions, it's finally done!

I'm a new sims builder and I want to challenge myself not only to build more but to learn new building techniques/styles. HOWEVER, I'm a super slow builder... I mostly end up doing tiny homes because of that, so I wanted to create a 30-day build challenge with only tiny houses. It's much more realistic to finish a build like this in a day than a whole standard house.

The list & basic ground rules can be found [here](https://mollymossy.notion.site/It-s-a-Small-World-30-day-Tiny-House-Build-Challenge-bf95424afd9a49f89f5fb2ffb5c8a571), and since there were people interested in it, I decided to make it public. To make it easier, I'm copying the list below:

# Build a tiny house

1. **Day 1:** with at least 3 levels using only ladders (no stairs)
2. **Day 2:** with James Turner’s [The Sims 4 Random Challenge Generator](https://jamesturner.yt/randomchallenge/tiny-home) (link directly to tiny house filter)
3. **Day 3:** based on a holiday (real world)
4. **Day 4:** using your favorite color(s)
5. **Day 5:** that is a loft for three college students
6. **Day 6:** based on your favorite world in TS4
7. **Day 7:** with an A-frame structure
8. **Day 8:** that is a shipping container (Eco Lifestyle-inspired!)
9. **Day 9:** for a profession in The Sims 4
10. **Day 10:** as a starter home for a couple
11. **Day 11:** using your favorite pack in TS4
12. **Day 12:** as a mini public lot: a mini spa, mini coffee shop, café, bistrô, a tiny lighthouse, a library, a park/wedding venue, a small bar…
13. **Day 13:** based on an EA build (turn it into a tiny house!)
14. **Day 14:** that serves as a vacation home (country, beach, mountain, cabin…)
15. **Day 15:** halfway point: free build! Do whatever you want! Repeat a challenge from before, mix and match two days together etc.
16. **Day 16:** 100% underground (theme suggestions: survivalist, serial killer, hoarder, hobbit, a zombie apocalypse bunker, an alien’s house, etc)
17. **Day 17:** based on a piece of media you love (a book, a song, a movie, a TV show, a video game)
18. **Day 18:** for an aspiration in TS4

I personally love the culture (things i have heard)- partying, going out, hanging out with friends, working out.  I have a monthly earning of USD 4K+ but our family also have assets in our home country that we are considering to sell and buying property in brazil to get PR fast. 

I understand that learning Portugese is a must and i am prepared To do that. Now the situation is 

1. I have the option to move to US for an MBA and have a job there. I got accepted in top 20 B schools and I worked remotely for companies there, so it will be less hard for me to find a job there but i don't want to get into that hustle. Income generation is not a priority to me. Rather having a great community and fun life is.

2. I heart says move to Brazil, work remotely or get a job in the tech sector as I have 3-4 years of programming experience as well as remote job experience in US firm. I know I have to choose a safe place to live in brazil as well as crime is a concern.


I love an active lifestyle but in my country there isn't much to do. I also love having friends for watching a game, inviting them to my house for bbq, throwing a party, going on trips. 

If i move to Brazil by applying for a digital nomad visa or an investment visa- will it be a wise choice? 

Can i bring my parents to Brazil as dependents later or apply as my family once i get PR/Citizenship. Will they be able to make friends with older people? Do they have things to do here as gringos?

Will i be able to make good number of close friends over time like in two three years? I am generally very friendly and have made a lot new friends after 30. I am 36 (Male).  ",1,1728420395.0,Brazil,8,0.67,False

But everything’s gonna be closed because it’s gonna be on a Sunday so even if I do save enough money, if I don’t leave my house in the morning to do stuff, I’ll get to go to Starbucks, get a birthday coffee, and that’s it lmao.  

I’m so tired of my older brother having cool birthdays and I’m tired of all the times I’d get dragged along to places I don’t wanna go for a gift that’s actually for someone else… but if they do it on my birthday, they can say it’s for me and then treat me like shit the whole time, make me sleep on the floor, never actually say happy birthday when it is my birthday, and do everything I said I don’t wanna do. I finally put my foot down about that because I’m fucking tired of being forced to do shit I don’t want and then having it over my head as some giant favour done for me and I should get down on my hands and knees and kiss the ground they walk on.

1fza3xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/1fza3xp/feeling_hopeless/,Feeling hopeless,"I posted in here a couple weeks ago about having difficulty finding a job here.

Well, it's weeks later and I've still not gotten a job.

I thought I was hired at a particular restaurant as a HOST (way below my experience but I'm taking what I can get at this point). I was told I'd hear from someone on Monday (yesterday) in regards to when I'm going to start and to fill out paperwork. Well, I heard nothing. So I followed up, only to be told ""hi, sorry unfortunately we decided to go in a different direction."" What? 

Had an interview at another place a few weeks back. Interview went really well. I felt I hit it off with the manager really well. She told me to come in for a stage the following week. Two days before the stage, she emails me that she'll need to reschedule and have me come in a different day. Even asks what other days I'm available. I email back immediately. Never heard back from her again.

I'm getting extremely disheartened. I don't even have money to get a coffee at this point. I'm doing everything to get a job, but no one seems to want to hire me. I don't do drugs, I barely drink. I don't understand what the fuck I'm doing wrong? 

I'm thinking I may move back to California (where I'm from) if this continues. I didn't move here to sit around and be unemployed.

1fza0se,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fza0se/how_to_stop_ramping_anxiety/,How to stop ramping anxiety ,"Hey guys,

Been feeling a bit down so I decided to write this here in case someone has any similar experience to chime in.

So last year I (28M) met Jane (28F) during a rotation at work (we work at different places, but did that internship together). We got along great, started flirting and eventually hooked up and started seeing each other.

As we progressed I learned more about Jane. She had had a long term boyfriend who cheated on her and with whom, after breaking up 1 year early, she started a FWB relationship despite harboring intense resentment.

Eventually, she met me and ended things with him but he was always a shadow in our relationship. We only dated for around 2 months but I was completely blindsided when she ended things. I had known she had her reservations about our relationship and about ""moving on"" so fast but things we're truly great when we were together. The thing is her anxiety caught up with her when we were apart and she eventually wanted to backtrack things and start again ""as friends"". This was hard for me. I felt her drifting away, she stopped answering texts and I couldn't control my own anxiety and took it poorly. She was avoidant and I became desperately attached...

Eventually, after 1/2 weeks of her back peddaling on the relationship she said she needed time and that she'd come for me if she ever thought she was ready.

I felt unloved and unnapreciated. Jane said that she did have feelings for me but somehow it wasnt enough (i understand that if she really did, we'd have stayed together).

And no, she did not leave me to go back to him.

The next few months were terrrible for me, I only contacted her 2 or 3 times due to issues related to the internship and eventually I moved to another city for a different internship. I always kept the idea of trying to get back together and was hurt when she didnt contact me before I left as she had implied she might...

When i was away. I did really work on myself. I worked out much more frequently, lost a bunch of weight I had gained, cooked for friends often, walked a lot, started journaling (not that often but I try) and even seeing a therapist (also due to other relationship trauma, which resurfaced during this ""break up""). Whenever we started therapy she'd always ask ""how I've been?"" and I'd always say great, truthfully.

Unfortunately, I sabotaged myself. I had always thought that once I came back I had to text Jane. To see where she stood and if she there was anything lingering there.

Last week, I moved back to city A and I did text Jane if she wanted to meet for coffee. She replied that she did but didnt set a date as she had a really hectic schedule (i know she does, we're both residents on a shitload of extra hours a week).

It's not been easy, The weather here is terrible, its been raining non-stop and I have been obsessing over her lack of definition. I know that if she really wanted this to happen she'd make it happen, but i also know that I showed up at a time after all the schedules are made and extra shifts distributed.

Nevertheless, despite knowing things will probably not workout the way I want them to, I still feel like I need to meet her.

How can I handle this anxiety and prevent it from ramping up so much? I keep talking to a few friends over this and they've been tireless but I would like to be able to control myself without having to impose on them...  I have a therapist appointment next week...

  
Edit: I know that even if we magically got together right now it would end terribly as I'm a pool of anxiety at the moment and the power dynamic in the relationship would be completely fucked.",2,1728420034.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1fz9zu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1fz9zu3/my_f37_boyfriend_m33_cant_set_boundaries_with_his/,My F/37 boyfriend m/33 can’t set boundaries with his ex F/35 and still says I love you to her  ‘platonically’,"
He  (m/33) says they say “I love you” platonically and that he loves her (f/35) but is no longer in love with her. The thing is, they were together for 8 years and engaged til they split up only a 2 years ago. They’ve been in contact since, they never stopped keeping in touch, only lessened the frequency. Never went no contact. They share custody of a pets and have many mutual friends She lives 2 hours away.

Last year he said he wasn't over her yet, so we began dating in the summer when he said he finally was and the tension was building between us.

They go into town to bring each other the pets for shared custody. Last time she was in town, she arrived at 2am, because 1 of their dogs had been cleared for surgery … and she was bringing the dog to my ex and she had a bunch of gear in her car. She was staying at her friend’s place about 25 minute drive from my boyfriend’s place. Her friend has a huge dog, so she couldn’t spend the night there with their tiny, sick dog. 

She told my boyfriend  that she’d need his help at 2am to bring the dog in since the dog gets hyper. And she’ll be super tired once she stops for the hand off and just wants to crash at his place. He said yes. She offered to sleep on the couch and he rejected it. Instead he gave her the bed sand crashed at his friend’s place nearby. 

I was trying to brainstorm ways to make the handoff/situation easier for everyone (ie. lockbox, etc), and when I did, he said “Ok I’ll call her to ask”… and then he’d message or call me back to say it won’t work for her, and that she needs his help when she arrives. I let him know I felt really uncomfortable with it, and he understood. 

So she spent the first night, as of 2am that night, at my boyfriend’s place with the small dog so the dog wouldn’t be too confused… and because she was too tired to drive the extra 25 mins to her friend’s place. So she slept in my boyfriend’s bed, while he crashed on the couch of his friend who lives nearby. He texted and called me when he walked home. He went over in the morning, the ex left for her friend’s place 25 mins away. 

My boyfriend was so exhausted the next day, he canceled plans to have coffee with her and they rain checked for the next time she’s in town. According to him, she knows about me. 

Thoughts? What should I do, break up with him or talk to him or her about this, and if so - how? 

TL;DR: my (F/37) new bf (m/33) has shared custody of pets with his his ex-fiancée (f/35) and he let her stay over at his place after she drove 2 hrs to be in town to bring 1 of their dogs to him, and insisted he stay up til 2am on a work night to help her. He crashed on his friend’s couch nearby while his ex slept in his bed with their dog. he can’t set boundaries with her, and they even still say “i love you” to each other but he says it’s platonic. Is this normal, should i dump him or talk to him about it

is it because i talk too much? i try to not talk about myself unless asked and not to brag or anything..and then i try to ask just as much back because i want to get to know them BACK lol

I got up she said ""thank you"" I replied with,  ""anything for you babe. You're my favorite person."" And after 10 years being together she said ""you're my favorite person."" I was stunned because she has never said that back to me. 

I fucked it up by asking her ""really?"" Then she said well my favorite adult. The kids."" 

Now I know it's not realistic to expect the same, but I live my wife like we're going to be alone together one day and our kids will go off and find their own favorite persons. I absolutely love our children. I'd give everything and anything I could for them. Except where my love and devotion to my wife. I love her first. 

When she responded initially I thought she was reciprocating the sentiment. And when she clarified all the air left my lungs and my heart sank. 

Now I have things to deal with feeling replaceable as a kid and what not. There's always work there. But I thought I was number one to somebody. And now I'm just kind of sad.

1fz9rpf,https://i.redd.it/hs5ox159eltd1.jpeg,Character: Qphiles,"{Character}

Name: Solif Luner
Nickname: Qphiles
Gender: Male (He/Him)
Equipment: Formal Suit & Tie
Weapon of choice: Martial Arts

{Abilities}

Martial Artist: The character is able to fight using just their body.

Acrobatic: Is able to jump and run around his environment in ways most people could only dream of. Also reduces the amount of energy consumed from doing physically exhausting actions by a small amount.

Tin Scribe: Can inscribe abilities onto an object that contains (or preferably is completely made out of) tin. The two most common abilities/inscriptions are [Barricade] which heavily increases the defense of an object and [Exaggerate] which exaggerates the effect from every other ability found on the tin except for itself.

(When these two are combined you get: [Exaggerated Barricade] This inscription makes the inscripted object **EXTREMELY** defensive and makes it so that if an attack doesn’t destroy it in a single hit, it will not receive **ANY** damage from that attack.)

{General Information}

[Info: Qphiles] An agent at a mercenary company that dictates the lives of the people of his world. His original goal before he learned who was responsible for killing his mother, was to try to become a leader as that was the goal his mother told him to aim for, since that was her goal before she let go of it to become a mother. After learning what actually happened during his mother’s assassination however, he made a new goal for himself: Destroy the company no matter the cost.

[Info: World] The world he lives in goes by the name of Duris. It is a world that contains powers both magical and demonic. Beastly abominations exist in this world, yet the worst thing it has are its people who are as cruel as they are greedy.

[Info: Laws] Duris is too chaotic, violent, and morally bankrupt to harbor any laws. It’s not that people haven’t tried to make them, it’s just that it’s more like a group of thugs threatening a local community to do what they want, as opposed to an actual law that could be used to aid people in need and prevent immoral actions.

[Info: Leaders] Duris has been ran by a worldwide mercenary company for literal generations at this point. The company has three leaders. These leaders can offer up missions the same as any other person, but the reward for those that complete these missions are much greater as they can range from receiving a ton of money, to receiving public acknowledgment from that leader, or even being invited to special events that others would normally not be allowed to join. These missions tend to be high ranked though, so it’s likely going to be a difficult and life threatening task.

[Info: Missions] A mission is any request made by another person that can range from simple work or manual labor at low ranks to public bounties and beast hunting at higher ranks. Ranks are used to determine how hard a job is to complete with low ranks being easy and high ranks being hard. The higher rank the mission is the better the reward that is offered in return for its completion.

[Info: Qphiles’ Mother] His last name Luner came from his mother. Qphiles’ mother was a master in martial arts, she would strike targets down even when the stars were the only thing remaining in the night sky. She single handedly raised and trained Solif on both how to survive this world and how to end the life of those who would take you away from it. She would do this until she was assasinated.

[Info: Qphiles’ Father] His first name Solif came from his father. Qphiles’ father was a rouge, a person who could make a fool out of you even when under the scrutiny of the suns’ light. Qphiles’ never spoke much with his dad as most of the time, his father was too busy doing missions to spend time with him. One day his mother and father got into a fight both verbal and physical, the fight ended with Qphiles’ mother telling his father to never return. From that point on Qphiles’ never saw his dad growing up.


{Lore}

[Chapter: The Young] When he was younger, he showed an interest in Tin Inscripting. His mother would deny this from him forcing him to spend his time training in martial arts, but he didn’t really have much of an interest in it. Qphiles took an interest in very little things, however he did find reading books to be quite entertaining. When his mother realized this she decided to create a book about martial arts to interest her son, this worked and made him get invested in martial arts and acrobatics. His mother would keep him hidden from the public eye due to the very cutthroat and cruel nature of the world they lived in. He only showed up in public the day his mother died, where he found her bloody corpse floating in a nearby pond.

[Chapter: The Rookie] Once his mother died the only one who could fend for him, was himself. So he went to the “HQ” and starting looking for missions to fulfill. They were mostly low rank missions like bringing a merchant to an area safely or killing a weak beast. However most of the time, to make ends meet he would have to make coffee for the other agents in the HQ. He hates doing this and views it as demeaning to his abilities. This goes on for a while, he eventually climbs the corporate ladder and goes on higher ranked missions, he even has a few assassins try to kill him showing that he has become a somewhat influential figure, yet the one thing that still seems to be consistent is that he still makes coffee for the other agents.

[Chapter: Bruce] One day, while making coffee for the agents, he meets a man by the alias of Bruce. Bruce was as strange as any other man, he wore a brown trench coat, had a mask on his face, and in general was just another jerk who thought they were a hot shot. However, Bruce got along shockingly well with Qphiles, granted this relationship was mostly one sided since Bruce would ask for coffee from Qphiles viewing him as a “pal” and Qphiles could honestly care less about the dude for the most part, but they would go on missions together aswell as split the rewards evenly between each other, showing that there was SOME trust between them. However, one day Qphiles rises up the ranks again, he hasn’t heard from Bruce in a while, when he is suddenly attacked by the traitorous man. They have a long winded fight when suddenly Qphiles ends up breaking his mask, only to see a face he thought he would never see again, it was his father.

[Chapter: False Family] While continuing to fight Qphiles demanded to know what was going on. Why was his own father fighting him and why would they hide themselves from their own son. It was at that moment he realized who was responsible for his mother’s death.

Back when he was younger Qphiles’ father learned about how Qphiles’ mother was swiftly rising up the ranks, so he made a plan. He planned to privately propose to her, then betray her when she had reached her prime, so that he could obtain her bounty, this failed leading to the fight between them.

When Qphiles had meet “Bruce” he was down on his luck, slowly losing relevance among the company. Seeing his son, he realized that he might just have another chance to climb the ranks, so he took it. After a long fought battle Qphiles eventually wins the battle killing his father.

[Chapter: Aftermath] Qphiles has been through some tough stuff during his life, this isn’t even the first time he has been betrayed. But having his own father betray him and learning that they were willing to marry and have a kid with someone JUST so they could kill them as if their relationship meant NOTHING to them for no reason other than greed. That really put a lot about this companies influence into perspective in Qphiles’ mind.

He realized that as long as this company exists, people will continue to commit worse and worse extremes for the company in hopes of one day becoming a leader.

Qphiles needed to destroy that company, even if it meant returning his people to the land of nothing but pure anarchy it was hundreds of years ago. No matter the cost, he must put an end to the hellish cycle that his people have been going through for literal generations.

1fz9rj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1fz9rj7/i_feel_like_youre_looking_for_a_mother/,"""I Feel Like You're Looking for a Mother""","Dear You,

Hi, it's me, the girl you didn't like. I met you 11 years ago this time in your living room. I brought you chocolates from the grocery store. I didn't want to show up empty-handed. I wanted to make a good first impression.

Your family was different from the other families in that region, or so I thought. I thought it was a miracle that I met you. Your son went to college, never went to jail, and he didn't have any children. I thought I had hit the jackpot. I was 25, and I knew I had been ""on the shelf"" for too long. I knew most of the other women had already been married or at least had children. I felt like a weird child in an adult's body. 

When I met your son, I thought there was hope for me. I really liked meeting you, as you seemed really, really nice. I had been praying for a really nice future mother-in-law. I thought you were the answer to my prayers. I was really excited--it felt like it was finally my turn. 

I was eager to get to know you and befriend you. I heard about all the cool little day trips you planned, like the little spa or the wine tours. There was nothing I wanted more than to be included. I lived alone, far from away from my family and friends. I spent almost all of my holidays alone. I cried every single day. I didn't really have anything, and I got lots of food and other things from dumpsters. 

Around the time that I met you, I found out my biological mother committed forgery in my name. One of the biggest loans was for $68k with a 13% variable interest rate. There wasn't a day when I didn't want to end it all. It couldn't have gotten any worse.

As our relationship took off, I was granted the opportunity to get a second job, which resulted in my hours to about a minimum of 70 hours a week, having no days off for weeks or even months. I fell asleep on the toilet many times. I just wish you understood that my whole life revolved around paying off the debt.

There was one Sunday in the early Spring when we all went to a restaurant. You gave me a letter and a check for $1800 as a blessing. I used 100% of it towards the debt. I'll never forget that blessing. To this day, I bless people in any way I can. I remember then that I would pay it forward, and I've kept my word.

It turned out I didn't get to go to the cool woman family meetups. It seemed as if my presence was a bit of an issue. Your oldest daughter was attached to your son, and I felt like I was some kind of imposition. It certainly wasn't my intention--we were all adults in our 20s. I saw a serious relationship as something to be excited about.

You had the cool little spa day with your daughter and your boyfriend's daughter. I didn't get to come. I wanted to go so bad. I guess it worked out because I go to fancy spas quite often these days.

Your daughter would get into very sour moods, so we changed lots of things to suit her. Your son would take her out to run errands and spend time with her. All of our dinners revolved around including her and what she wanted to do. When she wanted to watch a television show, I offered to go to the grocery store for her. I worked 7 days a week. The last thing I wanted was to do things for your adult daughter.

To be honest, I thought the whole thing was ridiculous. Your daughter was almost 30, not working, and living at home. Still very desperate to be liked and included, I even would clean your large house. I organized your closet, vacuumed the leaves off your rug, rearranged furniture, and even scooped out the litter box. I wish you had any idea how exhausted I was. Your daughter often watched TV and ate candy. I thought it was so strange.

There was another Sunday we went to an Italian restaurant. I remember we had to be there at 2, but we arrived at 2:15. It was my fault. I had to go to the store and get a new pair of non-slip shoes. The soles of my shoes came off and I had a shift at 5. I wasn't trying to be rude. I'm sorry. Your daughter huffed and puffed and played the silent treatment game. I didn't mean any harm. Could you possibly see why I might have been late? Could you possibly see the bigger picture?

A few months later, your niece was randomly expecting and had a baby shower. I barely knew her, but I bought her a nice gift. To be honest, that was a bit of a sacrifice for me. That was almost one whole shift at the restuarant. She didn't even send a thank you. Still, I kept doing anything in my power to be liked and included. Don't worry--I'm noticing the recurring theme.

I really, desperately wanted to get to know you, the way it seemed like everyone else get to. It seemed like everyone was very special and I was, really, just this servant figure. I just wanted to spend time with you one on one. I don't know, maybe getting a coffee? It didn't have to be anything big. I was convinced that if you just gave me a chance, you'd see some good in me. I knew I was an outsider--my makeup, my accent, my hair, my clothes, my home region, and my brand of Christianity. I knew I stuck out, I was very self-conscious about it, but I was hopeful you would see beyond that. Maybe you'd have come to the conclusion that we aren't so different after all. 

I when how I really wanted to look at baby photos of your son, but I guess your daughter was there. We never looked at them together, but you let me take the albums home.

I eventually got to move two hours away from you. I'll never forget that day. It was the best day of my life. I was finally moving up in the world, but I didn't want to settle. I knew I was made for bigger things. I was still convinced that maybe if you gave me a chance I could finally get what I thought was ""having it all"". 

We all decided to meet halfway--you, me, and your son. You were clearly not happy that I wanted to spend one evening getting to know you without your adult daughter. I felt like she dictated everything. I wanted you to get to know your son and I. I wanted you to take an interest in us. I was so, so excited. I wanted you to be a part of it. I never had any intentions of harm. I think you thought of me as some kind of monster. I feel really misunderstood.

It was a small middle eastern restaurant. I was surprised that kind of food even existed where we met, but okay. You sat across the table from me and you took my hand. You looked me dead in the eye and said, ""I feel like you're looking for a mother.""

I never forgot those words. In spite of you and your little day trips and little group, I ended up making my dreams come true. I moved across the world, even after you put me down in front of everyone at your mother's funeral saying I'd never be able to do it. Remember the times I let you cry on my shoulder? I'm older now and I understand that hurt people hurt people. The problem wasn't me.

Yeah, I did it. I moved across the world. I got more money and better looking. I met some incredible people and saw some fascinating places. I could absolutely write a book. If you saw me now, you wouldn't even recognize me. I'm not eating food from dumpsters. I go to Michelin restaurants and I hop on planes to different cities. I'm not walking around the sad Walmart aisles anymore.  

Your son came with me, but I left him after the umpteenth bender. I couldn't save him from his drinking. To give you some credit, you eventually met my biological mother across the world so we could organize our mutual stuff from a storage unit. You apologized to my mother on behalf of your son. 

I remember how you would email me before I left him, how you wanted to travel but was too afraid to. I sat there and wrote you emails to help you. At my core, there was nothing I wanted more than to just be liked and accepted by you. It was an insatiable need. I so desperately wanted to ""win"" that I put up with your son's drinking problem and bent over backwards for your family.

I admit I looked you up on Facebook to see if you're still alive. Apparently, you very much are. Years have passed, but I haven't forgotten you. I think of where I came from and where I am now.  

I'm finally getting married, and his mother is an angel. I didn't have to do anything to prove myself. She loved me just because.

I wish you well.

","I (26m) was social with girls while in school, but since 16, I've had the mindset of all women hate me. The reason being is that I don't have friends who are women and I don't socialise with women.

Whenever I see an attractive women, I think ""what's the fucking point?"". Even sitting in the local coffee shop is agonizing due to the cute women who work there, I'd love to be able to turn my brain off and enjoy a coffee, but it's too much.

I have plenty of guy friends, an active social life and fun hobbies (in my option). But whenever a pretty women enters the picture, I start to feel shit about myself.

I see the way that some women flirt with my friends, or how their eyes light up when my friends walk into the room, it's enough to ruin my fun night. I used to cry myself to sleep on weekends when I used to drink alcohol, I've since stopped for mental health reasons.

I'm not a virgin (lost it at 24) but I got incredibly lucky, I've never had sex with a women due to my own confidence, and I hate myself for that.

I'm not an incel, I don't hate women. I fully understand that I'm the problem and that women don't want to spend time with a sad/depressed guy like myself.

I'm a decent looking guy who takes care of the basics such as style, hygiene, grooming etc. (photo of profile, if you'd like to look). But none of that matters if you're so mentally broken that you can't even envision having a relationship, or even having a women be interested in you.

I makes me physically sick when I see guys who are players, fucking and chucking women because they're bored. I've seen some of the sexting on my friends phone, they have women begging for sex, and I can't even look a women in the eyes without feeling nervous, and FUCK ME I feel like a complete loser of a man.

Logically, I know the solution is to talk to women, and keep doing it until I learn what works and what doesn't, but I genuinely don't even have balls to talk to women, unless it's work related.

1fz9p2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/1fz9p2w/a_comparative_review_of_3_chez_pierre_dupes_with/,A comparative review of 3 Chez Pierre dupes with the originals they’re based on,"It’s something I wanted to do for a while now. That is, see how specific dupes compare one-on-one with the originals, and see how they hold up. Last week I got ahold of these 3 Chez Pierre frags, so this is my take on them

**1 Million, Paco Rabanne | Million Dreams by Chez Pierre** — I think Million Dreams captures the essence of 1 Million remarkably well. To a large extent, it mirrors the original with just the right balance between the upper fresh notes (mandarin/peppermint) with the warmth of cinnamon. It all combines really neatly into a base of patchouli/leather. It also has an impressive longevity and pretty strong sillage. It lasted me last weekend (on a night out) pretty much the entire evening and I could still feel it well into the morning. The *only* major difference I found was that the original had a lighter afterglow, while the dupe was slightly sharper. In any case, it’s probably my favorite fragrance for more formal evening occasions

Personal rating: 9/10

Opening: Excellent, transitions well after \~30 into the middle and base notes

Longevity: 7-8 hours



**Hacivat, Nishane | Golden Ray by Chez Pierre** — It has the core of what makes the original Hacivat great, offering the same “bright” upper notes in the opening before following into the more earthy notes of cedarwood (with a twist of patchouli). In particular, this one stood out to me because of how well the lighter citrusy notes (i.e. pineapple) combine with the jasmine + patchouli base. Still, I think that the original puts a bit more emphasis on the jasmine while the dupe has a more mellow touch of that pineapple afterglow. It’s got a pretty strong presence overall while also being very durable. Solid choice for an everyday summertime fragrance since it’s inoffensive enough that you can easily have it on whatever the occasion

Personal Rating: 8.5/10

Opening: Solid, I could still feel the citrusy notes after \~1h

Longevity: \~6 hours



**Black Opium by Yves Saint Laurent | Magnificent Black by Chez Pierre** — My wife’s favorite brand so this is also a love letter of sorts to her taste. Quite faithful to the original as it’s got that same “seductive” quality people love about it. The sweetness of the floral notes (plus pink pepper) blends really well into the vanilla base while also having that specific warmth of coffee mixed with orange (without actually being citrusy). It has a really nice projection and it lasted me about as long as the original. Black Opium smells slightly more musky, while the dupe has a lighter sweetish smell, which is the main point of difference I could find. Altogether, it’s a very good budget-friendly alternative to Black Opium, and probably lasts the longest. Some people recommend that you should wear this only in the evening but I think it’s a solid day perfume as well, depending on how much you put on



Personal rating: 8/10

Wife’s rating: 100/10

Opening: Very spicy, transitions after \~20 min. into the muskier notes

Longevity: \~8+ hours



Personally, I’m quite satisfied with all three, even though my favorite is probably the 1 Million dupe. Minimalistic bottle design, great smell, solid longevity — all in all, very good cheap alternatives to the branded stuff.

Every year some friends and I make a list of Christmas movies that look bad and/or weird and marathon them with appropriate amounts of nog. The real bright spot of the run every year is that we give our friends and family a handful of really terrible looking rom-com-ish films - the kind that look sweet and cozy but are actually insanity on film - and let them vote on which one we'll watch. They usually pick the worst. 

To give you an idea of what we're looking for, past home runs in this category have been - 

- **How Sarah Got Her Wings** - Lindsey Gort gets pancaked by a bus and gets refused entrance into Heaven until she helps her ex-boyfriend back on Earth find a new girlfriend

- **Last Christmas** - Emilia Clarke almost died once, so she's become a *really* unlikeable couch surfer ever since. She never does laundry once in the weeks we follow her, nearly puts her boss, Michelle Yeoh, out of business, and falls in love with an incredibly predictable twist ending \*

1fz9m4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1fz9m4a/brain_fog/,Brain fog? ,"So needing to provide some backstory: July 5th I went to urgent care because I had heartburn for days no matter what I ate. I've always been someone who doesn't get heartburn unless I had something really sour or incredibly fattening. The dr told me after hearing about my symptoms that he suspected I had gastritis. Prescribed a PPI for two weeks, took it, had constant burning in my stomach, heartburn, etc, even with immediate diet changes. 

About 3 weeks ago my stomach pain almost completely subsided and I haven't had heartburn in a long time. As of late, my symptoms are occasional indigestion, slight lump in my throat, hoarse voice, very seldom regurgitation of foods, but the worst symptom has been brain fog. I'm still very careful with what I eat, but not as restrictive as I was in august because I was losing too much weight. I haven't had coffee, anything spicy, anything citrusy or any high fat foods since June. 

Can anyone tell me why I'm still getting these symptoms? I don't get brain fog every time I eat, but it seems to be random. I was just eating some chicken breast (nothing but salt) and have the worst brain fog I've ever had. I feel like I'm in a simulation.
I can't avoid triggers because I have no idea what they are and it's happening with foods that have been safe foods for months.  

For more diet info: I don't eat dairy or gluten currently and haven't for months. I only eat chicken and turkey. I eat most vegetables (wasn't able to do this when my stomach was on fire still.) for breakfast I usually eat gluten free bread, sun butter and nondairy yogurt. 

Would love it if anyone could help! My GI has left me in the dark. I had an endoscopy on Friday and am waiting for results. Nothing was said to me after the procedure about inflammation or anything. They just sent me on my way without telling me anything and said biopsy results should be here within a week, so I don't currently have an official diagnosis but all signs point to gerd and (possibly healed?) gastritis without h pylori.

1fz9hy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PopularSupplements/comments/1fz9hy3/a_new_chapter_how_sight_care_transformed_my/,A New Chapter: How Sight Care Transformed My Vision and My Life,"In a small town nestled in the heart of Ohio, I found myself sitting in a diner, staring at my coffee cup, contemplating my future. At 58, I was experiencing the telltale signs of aging, particularly with my vision. It all started with minor inconveniences—street signs appeared blurred, I struggled to read the newspaper, and the vibrant colors of life seemed to dim with each passing day. I knew I needed a change, but I had no idea where to start.

It was during a casual lunch with my friend Sarah that everything began to shift. Sarah, a health enthusiast, had been raving about a supplement called Sight Care that she claimed had drastically improved her vision. I listened intently, a mix of skepticism and hope swirling within me. ""It's not just any supplement,"" she explained. ""It’s designed to support eye health with natural ingredients and even help with age-related issues like macular degeneration and cataracts."" Intrigued but cautious, I decided to dig deeper.

That evening, I returned home and began researching Sight Care. What struck me was the glowing testimonials from users who had similar experiences to mine. They shared stories of how their vision had improved significantly, allowing them to rediscover the beauty of life. I found myself wondering if this could be my solution.

As I explored the science behind the product, I learned that Sight Care was packed with key ingredients like Lutein and Zeaxanthin, known for their ability to filter harmful blue light and protect the retina. It also contained powerful antioxidants to shield the eyes from oxidative stress—something that had never crossed my mind before. With every new fact I uncovered, I felt a flicker of hope that perhaps I wasn’t alone in this battle against fading eyesight.

A few days later, I took the plunge. With a heart full of optimism, I ordered my first bottle of Sight Care. As the days turned into weeks, I began to take the supplement as directed, two capsules a day. The first week passed slowly, with little change. I began to worry that I had fallen for yet another gimmick, but I pressed on.

[Sight Care](https://preview.redd.it/lmrl1myh2itd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=92c7f23be3fcdc4018a9d457f3ec09c355719b5e)

By week three, I noticed something incredible. Colors around me seemed to regain their vibrancy, and I found myself squinting less often. It was subtle but undeniable—a shift in my perception. During this time, I decided to share my journey with my family, hoping they would join me in exploring this newfound possibility. My daughter, Emily, was particularly interested. ""Maybe it can help Grandma too,"" she said, recalling how my mother struggled with her vision in her later years.

Fast forward a few months, and I was due for my routine eye exam. Nervously, I entered Dr. Miller's office, my optometrist, unsure of what to expect. After the usual tests, he examined my eyes closely and raised an eyebrow in surprise. “Your vision has improved,” he said, astonished. “I can’t explain it, but whatever you’re doing is working!”

My heart swelled with joy. I shared my experience with Dr. Miller, describing the journey I had taken with Sight Care. He nodded thoughtfully, appreciating the evidence behind the ingredients that promote eye health.

As I continued taking Sight Care, I delved deeper into its ingredients. Astaxanthin, for example, caught my attention. It was known to improve stem cell strength and protect the retina, a game-changer in preventing macular degeneration. The more I learned, the more empowered I felt about my health. I realized this wasn’t just about vision; it was about taking control of my life.

My experience didn’t just stop with me. Emily began to notice the changes in my demeanor—how I approached life with renewed enthusiasm. Inspired, she began researching natural health solutions for herself. Together, we attended workshops and engaged in discussions about holistic health, a journey we hadn’t embarked on before. The bond between us strengthened as we explored these new avenues together.

One evening, as we prepared dinner, I noticed how vivid the colors of the vegetables looked. “It’s incredible, isn’t it?” I remarked, slicing a bright red bell pepper. “I can actually see the details again.” Emily smiled, understanding the weight of those words.

This journey with Sight Care transformed not just my vision but also my outlook on life. It sparked conversations about health within my family and encouraged us to adopt healthier habits. We started going for evening walks, discussing nutrition, and even cooking healthier meals together.

Reflecting on my journey, I realized that my experience with Sight Care wasn’t just about taking a supplement; it was about reclaiming my life and inspiring those around me. My vision improved, yes, but more importantly, I reconnected with my family and learned to appreciate the little things again—the colors of a sunset, the laughter of friends, the intricate details of everyday life.

**For anyone out there who feels the fog of declining vision, I urge you to explore what Sight Care can offer. It’s not just a supplement; it’s a step towards a brighter, clearer future. Our eyesight is a precious gift, and taking care of it is an investment worth making.** [**https://sightcare.com**](https://freezegluco.com/sightcare.html)

Over the past year, I’ve gained 80 pounds. I used to be a vegetarian for five years, but I stopped when I got into a healthy relationship. We cooked, baked, and indulged in all kinds of sweet treats, and now I’ve gained almost 100 pounds. When I look at myself in the mirror, my face is puffy and round. Last year, people used to call me ‘miss’ everywhere I went. Strangers would hold doors for me, strike up conversations, ask for my number, and tell me how pretty I looked. Now, I go unnoticed, and I hate it. I miss feeling good about my body. I miss being outgoing, but now I’m stuck inside, wanting to hide from the world.

I can’t believe that back then I thought I was fat. I look at old photos and can’t believe that was me. Now that I’m back to being a vegetarian, I’ve tried to go back to how I used to eat. I remember how I’d eat a small vegetarian meal, like a rice bowl with cauliflower, avocado, broccoli, green onions, and Sriracha, and it would fill me up for the whole day. Then, I’d binge on food, throw it up immediately after, and that’s how I stayed so skinny. I didn’t work out. I barely ate, drank a lot of coffee to stay awake, and vaped to avoid cravings.

All I want is to lose 50 pounds. I’m thinking of going back to my old ways, but instead of ordering takeout, I’ll cook my own favorite foods since I know how to cook now. Plus, I don’t want to spend $50 on takeout. I just miss being skinny. I miss my body. I miss my curves. I was perfect in every way. It was ridiculous how pretty I was, and I can’t believe I took it for granted. I’m not exaggerating—I was gorgeous, and I can’t believe I didn’t appreciate it at the time.

I’m writing this as a reminder that I need to lose weight, and I don’t want anyone telling me, ‘love your body the way it is.’ No, I don’t love my fat body. It’s ugly, and it needs to be fixed. I want the attention again. I want the compliments. I want it all back, and I will get there. I’m tired of being called ‘ma’am.’ I miss being called ‘miss,’ especially since I’m in my early 20s. It’s so frustrating! Just because I’m bigger doesn’t mean I’m old, and I still have a baby face, which makes it even more confusing. I’m just sick of it. So I’ll get there. Five months from now I’ll be back to normal. I’ll be hot again. Also if anyone wants to give me tips please do I’ll take it all in. Thanks!",1,1728418671.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I'm looking to get a DR650, the question is simply new vs used. Originally I was leaning towards used but I want something fairly recent with low miles/kms. On FB and kijiji there's only a couple bikes like this and at the end of the day the price difference to getting a new one isn't huge. Everything below is Canadian dollar.

Used 2023: \~3000km (\~1900 miles), upgraded seat, acerbis tank, foot pegs, windscreen, luggage rack. Bike is in excellent shape, still has over a year left on factory warranty. Downside is I'm on the road for 4.5 hrs each way. Owner is asking $6500 firm. In Ontario we pay 13% sales. Add in \~$200 in gas and coffee/food and I'm looking at about $7600 for the bike.

New 2024: \~$8250 out the door

Is the $650 difference worth going new? In terms of mods, I know I'll want the upgraded seat bringing the difference to about $1000, but everything else is take or leave for now as I'm a new rider. Mechnically I know I'd be happy with that used bike. It's in fantastic shape, but there's also something really nice about having something brand new. What do you all think? Should I stick with new, or would you guys go new for \~$650 more?

I 1000% have an alcohol intolerance. I used to be able to drink 10+ drinks with no hangover the next day, but now one sip of alcohol triggers severe cramping, diarrhea, chills, and nausea within hours of consumption. Nothing has changed in terms of medication (been on lexapro and birth control for years and was able to consume alcohol just fine). Suddenly when I turned 21 I couldn't drink alcohol without experiencing these symptoms every time. Rum is the worst by far. I had about a 3 x 1 x 1 inch piece of a rum soaked cake and had liquid, green diarrhea for hours after. Horrible. 

I also seem to have some sort of caffeine intolerance. Coffee drinks like lattes and regular coffees have always hurt my stomach and triggered diarrhea so I have avoided them. Recently, I have appeared to develop an intolerance to other caffeinated drinks like refreshers and chai lattes from Starbucks. I experience stomach cramping and diarrhea within hours of drinking them (usually venti sized). I can drink a diet coke and boba drinks just fine, so what is the difference? Is this normal?

For background, I am 24F and have previously been diagnosed with anxiety and health-related OCD which don't help the stomach aches. They don't trigger them anymore as I've worked on exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, but if I get sick from food or something I can have anxious thoughts.
