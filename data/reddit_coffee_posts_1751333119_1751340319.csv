Here’s a little about me to help you decide if you'd like to reach out!

Music is my passion—it's the core of my life. I’ve curated a playlist that spans around 20 hours, featuring everything from Big Band classics to SZA!

I'm an avid reader and a huge fan of audiobooks. Since I travel frequently, listening to books is a convenient way for me to enjoy stories. Plus, I love the experience of being read to! I often listen at double speed, so if you want to chat about literature, I’d be thrilled.

Movies are another love of mine, especially dramas, rom-coms, musicals, and some thrillers and comedies. The last film I caught in theaters was ""Materialists."" I enjoyed it, although it wasn't as romantic as I expected—so I might see it again with a fresh perspective.

Theater, ballet, and opera . I adore dressing up to witness exceptionally talented performances—it’s always a magical experience.

When it comes to food, I enjoy dining out and experiencing new restaurants. While I can cook and do enjoy it, I’m currently in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner spots with friends is my preference. I’m a big fan of iced coffee and enjoy sharing too much champagne with good company! 

I'm looking for someone aged between 26 and 50, located in the United States, who shares my preference for voting blue. Connecting with like-minded individuals is essential for me.

1lord2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/1lord2x/i_broke/,I Broke,"It's 11 PM. I had tried to sleep most of the day. I know the only way out is through. But I just couldn't do it any more.

When I went psychotic five years ago, they took me to jail instead of a mental ward. The guards beat the shit out of me. They broke my back and ruptured one of my lungs. Then they hogtied me and dragged me through the jail. They held me up in front of other inmates so they could also beat me. Then they stripped me naked and sprayed me with freezing water, and then dumped me in a freezing cell. An inmate raped me through the bars. I laid there for four days, drifting in and out of consciousness, shivering uncontrollably from hypothermia. There was no food and the water had feces in it.

I know, in my heart of hearts, that I died that night. I died, but then I came back. I remember begging God to not let me die in my own urine. Then, I passed out for the last time and woke up in the hospital.

That was five years ago. It broke me. It broke me straight down the middle.

I just couldn't take it any more tonight. I have smoked four cigarettes and had three cups of coffee and a glass of caffienated tea. When I feel I can stand it, I'm going to lay down again with the lights on and try to just rest the best I can, knowing it won't happen. But at least I know I won't pass out like I did in jail.

I have never felt this level of fear before. I am afraid I will literally lose my mind and my wife will have to drag me to the psych ward because I won't know what day it is or who the President is.

I'm sorry it ended this way. My goddess Hecate, she who called me, she who was with me in jail, is the only thing I have left to give me hope.

I need lots of support and hugs. My alter K is almost fully psychotic. The only positive I can say is that I'm not going to kill myself.

Now I feel emotionally trapped and guilty pulling away.,"I (23F) posted on a local subreddit a while ago asking for dating advice. At the time, my DMs were off, but I later turned them on. A guy (28M) messaged me with some advice. I accepted the message because the way he wrote made him seem older and mature.

He kept texting me. At first, I didn’t reply, but eventually I started responding. He was very articulate, and I enjoyed how well he expressed himself. I found out he doesn’t live far from me.

Over the 5 days we talked on Reddit, he would subtly flirt, but whenever I confronted him about it, he’d deny it. I told him I was planning to delete Reddit because it was becoming a distraction, and he asked if I could add him on Snapchat or Instagram. I eventually added him on Snapchat (it’s been 2 weeks now), but I clearly told him I only wanted to be friends.

After that, he started texting me constantly. When I said we were texting too much and I couldn’t keep up, he acted like I was disrespecting his time. He’d say things like, “I won’t bother you anymore,” or “I don’t want to stay where I’m not respected,” making me feel guilty. It felt like he was emotionally manipulating me. Every time I tried to create space, he’d make a scene out of it.

The more we talked, the more emotionally pulled in I started to feel—even though I never intended to get close. Then he brought up the idea of meeting in person for a “friendly coffee” and even offered to pick and drop me. I said no. Later, when the topic came up again, I reminded him that no girl would just get into a stranger’s car. He said I could choose the place instead. I told him I didn’t want to meet at all, and he replied with, “Maybe you’ll want to someday. I’ll wait.”

Now I feel stuck and unsure. I never wanted this connection to get so intense. It’s hard to pull away without feeling like the bad person, but I also don’t feel comfortable continuing this.

TL;DR:
I (23F) talked to a guy (26M) on Reddit for 5 days, then added him on Snapchat for 2 weeks. He became emotionally intense and guilt-tripping, even after I set boundaries. Now I feel emotionally pulled in and unsure how to pull back without guilt.",2,1751339925.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

I’m 21 and recently moved to Delhi from Punjab for my first job at Bank of America. It’s exciting, but also… really really lonely. I’ve always had a good group of friends back home. But now, some of them have moved abroad (Canada, Australia—you know how it is), and the ones who stayed, I’ve drifted from over time coz they shit friends.

My girlfriend lives in the same city, and while she’s always there for me emotionally, she’s going through a lot herself at home, so I don’t want to lean on her too much. I understand her situation, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss having someone to talk to, hang out with, or just chill with on weekends.

I’m not looking for anything romantic—just genuinely platonic friends in Delhi who’d be up for coffee, movies, exploring the city, going to events, or just talking about life. It’d be nice to have people around who are also in their 20s because in my office as well i cant seem to connect with my colleagues bcz all of them are older than me (in their 27s or 30+) 

If you’ve been in the same boat, or if you’re also new to the city and wanna build a little friend circle, pleaseeeeee feel free to DM me or drop a comment coz it’s really lonely:’).

1lorb1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lorb1o/i_dont_think_anybody_could_understand_the_depth/,"I don't think anybody could understand the depth of my loneliness. It is so depressing that subs like this one exist, or that there are people who mean well and try to help, yet that inner loneliness remains untouched.","

People don’t understand the inner source of my loneliness—nor that I’ve truly tried to connect with others. Right now, I’m both physically and psychologically alone. The only people I talk to are my family, who live elsewhere, but I don’t feel a real sense of connection with them.



I think my loneliness goes much deeper than most people realize. Some genuinely mean well and want to help, but they don’t understand that their kind of loneliness might be very different from mine.



You’re probably reading this thinking it’s just my problem—that it’s all in my head. Or maybe you think I’m just another isolated person who believes their loneliness is somehow unique. And you’re right: I haven’t really given you any evidence of what makes me different.



But that’s the problem—my inability to explain it.



I’m convinced it goes back to my childhood, maybe even to infancy. These are the kinds of feelings most people can’t access. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like death. Well—not death exactly, but dying. It has that horror element. That sense of powerlessness. That sense of finality.



So when someone online says, “If we lived closer, we could go out for a drink or a cup of coffee,” it feels like telling a dying person to take a Tylenol.



Dying is actually a pretty fitting metaphor—not just because it’s terrifying, but because it’s inherently lonely. You die. Yes, we all eventually die, but when it happens, it’s just you. It feels random, out of your hands.



Maybe if you’ve lived a long, full life, accomplished everything, and it’s happening slowly—you’re prepared. Maybe at 120, you’ve done it all, and it’s painless. Maybe God told you it would happen in your sleep, and you’ve been healthy, surrounded by loved ones, truly valued.



That’s one in a million—the best-case scenario. But even then, I think there’s still horror. The horror of something happening to you that you can’t stop. The horror of slipping into darkness, of not knowing what comes next. Of losing everything. Never again saying hi to your loved ones, never tasting your favorite food, never watching the sunset again.



It is horrifying.



We didn’t will ourselves into existence. Life itself is kind of terrifying and strange. Humans are strange. We pretend this is normal, but it’s not—it’s bizarre. Me typing this is weird. You reading it is weird. That we have a soft, mushy organ in our heads that “thinks”—that’s weird. That we eat, digest, and shit—that’s weird too.



But it’s a weirdness that’s become familiar. It took a long time. We fill our days with tasks and distractions just to forget how strange and unsettling it all is. And in that, I feel disconnected—from anything solid, anything truly understandable.



What does it mean to be someone’s child? Someone’s spouse? What does it mean to love, or be loved?



I feel like I’m walking blindfolded—and I’m painfully aware of it. I think we all wear it, but maybe others don’t notice it as much. Maybe theirs is looser. Maybe it’s genetics, maybe upbringing. Some people seem able to relax into life. I can’t. Every step I take feels like I’m about to fall. When people try to hold my hands, they feel like aliens pawing at me.



I feel too existentially self-aware. That’s what drew me to religion. But I couldn’t find solid ground there either. Not even in the idea that change is the only constant. We know nothing.



And every day, I’m falling. I’m dying. I see the loneliness of existence—the fingers of Death in every breath, every hello, every sunrise. No one could ever hold me and say, “It’s going to be all right.” Because it won’t be. Even when two people die together, they’re still dying alone.



I know, I’m all over the place. In some ways, I’m saying I’m just like you—that this is the human condition. But I’m also saying maybe I’m more self-aware. Or maybe something happened to me in childhood. Honestly, I don’t know.



All I do know is the depth of my loneliness. The pointlessness of making posts like this. Of having tried it all, said it all, heard it all, read it all. Of becoming exhausted. Jaded.",1,1751339818.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I (24F) went on a date with a man-child coworker (23M) just to get him to stop asking.


A few months ago, I joined a large agency. It was my first time working in a big shit creative agency. I was new, overwhelmed, and just trying to survive.

During one of the first office hangouts, I met this guy let’s call him Ayaan. He was wearing a Swiggy delivery jacket as a joke. I remember looking at him and thinking, “He’s too polished to be a delivery guy,” which he caught and laughed at. That was our first actual exchange. I casually asked him if he sings, he asked me “Why’d ask that” and I said “You got a nice voice” (I was very serious here, and not flirtatious) 

Apparently, that one compliment was enough for him to latch on.

The very next day, he asked for my number and before I could say anything, he pulled it from our office WhatsApp group without my consent. He also stalked my Instagram even though I hadn’t shared it with him. He started messaging me constantly asking me out for coffee, lunch, dinner, hangouts after work.

I said no to everything, consistently and politely. But he just would not stop. Every day, a new excuse to text or corner me at work. I didn’t want to be rude, I was still new and didn’t want to create unnecessary awkwardness but he kept pushing.

Eventually (after a month or so), I said yes to a movie. Not because I wanted to go — I didn’t. I just thought if I gave him that one chance, he’d finally leave me alone. I was tired and honestly just wanted it to stop. Also I kinda felt guilty for some reason. 

The date was horrible. He showed up high, red eyes, reeking of weed. Afterward, we grabbed food. There all he did was talk about his exes, his childhood trauma, how many girls he dated, how he even dated an actress but she turned bi and I was like Ok?!? And I dropped multiple hints that I wanted to go home. Told him it was getting late. Said my mom was calling. Even stood up to leave.

He ignored everything. Brushed it off with jokes. At one point, he said, “Let me talk to your mom, I’ll tell her I’m taking care of her daughter.” I was creeped out.

When we finally left the restaurant, I walked to my car, got in, and even started it. He walked up and literally stopped me from leaving. Then stood around outside smoking a cigarette and dragging the goodbye for another 20 minutes while I stood there, deeply uncomfortable.

He kept texting afterward. Begged me to watch Minions with him insisted on coming to my house late at night. I said no. He pushed. “Your family’s in town? So what?” When that didn’t work, he asked if we could FaceTime and watch it together. I kept refusing, but he wouldn’t let it go. Eventually, just to make it stop, I gave in once. And that was my mistake. I thought giving him closure would end it. Instead, it made him believe he had access.

And then it crossed into another line of disrespect.

And when I eventually ended all of it by saying “ I can’t do this, I don’t want any part of this”. He had the audacity to ask me “like you don’t want a part of this ever? Like you know I can easily pester you but I don’t. Are you sure, you don’t want this?” And I said “Yes, I don’t”

Things just escalated after this. 

He found my private YouTube channel something I use to post skits and reaction videos, a space I deliberately keep away from work. He not only watched it, but loudly called it out in front of the whole creative team: “Your video popped up in my recommendations,” he smirked. Everyone turned to look. He knew exactly what he was doing.

After that, the taunts started.

He gave me a made-up nickname from one of my videos “Jabudaya.” Said I looked like a 14-year-old boy. Mocked my work. Interrupted shoots I was leading. Tried to outtalk me in meetings. When I told him to stop, he said it was all just “fun.” But it never felt like fun. It felt targeted.

One time, right after lunch, he looked straight at me from across the room and yelled, “Catch!” then threw two rotis at me wrapped in foil. I was shocked and disgusted. I didn’t catch them. He walked over, placed them on my desk, and said, “If you don’t want them, feed them to the dogs.”

I told him, “I’m not taking that. Keep it away from me.”

He just smirked and said, “Well, J asked me to give it to you, so if you have something to say, go talk to her,” and walked away like it was all one big joke.

There were people around. I felt humiliated.

This is someone who brags about drinking, smokes weed constantly, and once told me, “I can’t even poop without smoking first.” He trauma-dumps constantly. Talks about how no girl sticks around. On our one and only date, he told me about how he’d tried to get with other women at work too.

After me, he moved on to an intern. Then another girl.

Why am I sharing this?

Because for the longest time, I thought maybe I was overreacting. Maybe I should’ve been firmer. Maybe it was my fault for saying yes to that one date. But here’s the thing I said no over and over again. He didn’t care. He took my number without consent. He stalked my social media. He mocked me publicly. I tried to keep the peace, and he took that as an invitation.

I’m done trying to justify my boundaries.

If anyone out there has ever felt like they were “too polite” or “too nice” to be taken seriously you’re not the problem. The person ignoring your boundaries is.

# Best Summer Braces Colors 2025: Ultimate Guide

Choosing the right braces colors can make a significant difference in your overall orthodontic experience, especially during the summer months. Your braces become an expression of your personality, a reflection of the season's vibrant energy, and a confidence booster as you enjoy all the fun the summer has to offer. This guide explores the best color combinations, trending shades, and practical considerations for selecting the perfect summer braces colors in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

Selecting the perfect braces colors involves more than just picking your favorite hues. Understanding the color wheel, considering your skin tone, and factoring in the potential for staining are all crucial elements in making an informed decision.

**Color Wheel Considerations:** The color wheel is a essential tool in understanding color relationships. Analogous colors (those next to each other on the wheel) offer a harmonious and subtle look, while complementary colors (opposite each other) create a bold and contrasting statement.Choosing analogous colors, such as light blue and green, can evoke a sense of calm and nature often associated with summer. Conversely, complementary colors, like orange and blue, can add a pop and vibrancy to your smile.

**Skin Tone Compatibility:** Your skin tone plays a significant role in how your braces colors appear. Individuals with warm skin tones (those with yellow or golden undertones) often look best in earth tones, golds, oranges, and reds. Cool skin tones (those with pink or blue undertones) tend to be complemented by blues, purples, silvers, and pinks. Neutral skin tones have the advantage of working well with a wider range of colors. Pairing colors that complement your skin tone will lead to a more aesthetically pleasing and confident smile.

**Staining potential:** Certain colors are more prone to staining than others. Clear bands, while initially appealing for their subtlety, can easily discolor from food and drinks like coffee, tea, and berries. Light colors, such as white and light yellow, also tend to show stains more prominently.darker colors, like navy blue and deep purple, are less likely to stain and can maintain their vibrancy throughout your orthodontic treatment. Keeping staining potential in mind and prioritizing good oral hygiene habits can help your braces colors stay fresh and appealing.

**Seasonal Trends:** Each summer brings new color trends in fashion and beauty, shaping popular choices for braces colors as well.Expect to see a rise in pastel shades,such as lavender,mint green,and powder blue,reflecting the light and airy feel of the season.Neon colors, like bright pink and electric yellow, can also make a statement, especially for those seeking a bold and playful look. Traditional favorites, like patriotic combinations of red, white, and blue for holidays like the 4th of July, will likely remain popular as well.

**Personal Preferences:** While all the above factors are valuable, personal preference should ultimately guide your final decision. Your braces colors are a reflection of your unique style and personality. Consider your favorite colors,hobbies,and the overall aesthetic you want to convey. Experimenting with different color combinations, consulting your orthodontist for recommendations, and visualizing the colors on your smile can help you confidently choose colors that make you feel happy and confident throughout the summer.

key features of choosing Summer Braces Colors in 2025 include:

 understanding color principles
 Considering skin tone
 Factoring in staining potential
 Staying updated with seasonal trends
* Prioritizing personal preference

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right summer braces colors can have several benefits beyond just aesthetics. From enhancing your confidence to expressing your personality, the right colors can make your orthodontic journey a more positive and enjoyable experience.

**Enhanced Confidence:** selecting colors that complement your skin tone and personal style can significantly boost your confidence. When you feel good about your appearance,you're more likely to smile,socialize,and engage in activities you enjoy. The positive effects of increased confidence can extend to various aspects of your life, from social interactions to professional opportunities.

**Expression of Personality:** Braces colors offer a unique opportunity to express your personality and individual style. Whether you opt for a bold and vibrant combination or a subtle and sophisticated palette,your braces become a statement about who you are. this can be particularly appealing during the summer months when self-expression is often celebrated and encouraged.

**Improved Mood and Motivation:** Surrounding yourself with colors that you find visually appealing can have a positive impact on your mood and motivation. Choosing braces colors that evoke feelings of happiness and energy can make the orthodontic process feel less daunting and more manageable. This can also encourage you to maintain good oral hygiene habits, leading to better overall results.

Addressing common questions about summer braces colors can help alleviate any concerns and provide valuable insights for making the best choices.

**What are the best color combinations for a patriotic look?**
A classic patriotic look involves combining red,white,and blue. You can opt for alternating red and blue bands, or create a tricolor pattern with red, white, and blue. Consider using silver instead of white for a more subtle, less stain-prone option. Always consider your orthodontist's advice for optimal aesthetics and hygiene.

**How can I prevent my braces colors from staining?**
To minimize staining, avoid or limit consumption of staining agents like coffee, tea, red wine, and deeply colored fruits and juices. Brush your teeth after every meal,and consider using a whitening toothpaste specifically designed for braces. You can also use a straw when drinking staining beverages. Regular visits to your orthodontist for cleanings are essential in maintaining the vibrancy of your braces colors.

**What colors make my teeth look whiter?**
Darker colors, like navy blue, deep purple, and emerald green, create a contrast that makes your teeth appear whiter. Avoid white or clear bands, as these tend to highlight any existing discoloration. Consider asking your orthodontist about specific shades that best suit your tooth color for the most flattering effect.**Can I change my braces colors mid-treatment?**
Yes, you can typically change your braces colors at each appointment. This allows you to experiment with different combinations, follow seasonal trends, or simply switch things up for a fresh look. Discuss your preferences with your orthodontist at your appointments.## Competitor Comparison

1lor0o3,https://youtu.be/Apu2CNCZW2Y,3 Real Horror Stories from Travel Apps | When Travel Goes Wrong,"# ""Offline"":

I’d been dreaming of this trip for months—a solo escape to the mountains, far from the noise of the city. I wanted silence, fresh air, and a chance to unplug. So, when I found a cozy cabin on a popular travel app, I didn’t hesitate. The listing promised a “rustic retreat with modern comforts,” nestled among pines with a lake nearby. The photos showed a charming log cabin with a wide porch and a rocking chair, and the price was half what other places charged. It seemed too good to pass up.

I booked it instantly and set off, letting the app’s navigation guide me. The drive started out fine, with rolling hills giving way to dense forest as I climbed higher into the mountains. My phone signal weakened, dropping to one bar, then none. But the app had downloaded the route, so I wasn’t worried. The directions took me off the highway onto a narrow, unpaved road that twisted through towering trees. The sun was dipping low, painting the sky orange, and the deeper I went, the more isolated it felt.

After an hour on that winding road, I spotted the cabin. It matched the photos perfectly: a sturdy log structure with a stone chimney and a porch overlooking a clearing. I parked my car, a beat-up sedan that had seen better days, and stepped out, breathing in the crisp pine-scented air. The silence was almost too perfect—no cars, no voices, just the faint rustle of leaves.

The host had said the key would be under a rock by the door. I found it easily and let myself in. The inside was just as advertised: a cozy living room with a stone fireplace, a plush sofa, and a small kitchenette stocked with basics. A fire was already burning in the hearth, which struck me as odd since I hadn’t started it. I figured the host must have set it up to welcome me, a nice touch for such a cheap rental.

I unpacked my bag, tossing my clothes into a drawer and setting my laptop on the table. It was getting dark, so I decided to take a quick walk around the property before settling in. The path behind the cabin led into the woods, and I followed it for a few minutes, enjoying the crunch of leaves under my boots. The forest was dense, the trees blocking out the last of the daylight. I didn’t go far—maybe ten minutes—before turning back. I didn’t want to get lost out there.

When I returned, the cabin door was slightly open. I froze. I was sure I’d closed it. My heart gave a little thud as I pushed it wider and stepped inside. Everything looked the same: my bag on the floor, the fire crackling, the kitchen untouched. Maybe I’d been careless and left it ajar. Shaking off the unease, I shut the door firmly and locked it.

Then I heard it—a rustling from the bedroom. Not loud, but deliberate, like someone moving around. My pulse quickened. I grabbed a heavy iron poker from the fireplace, its weight cold in my hand, and crept toward the bedroom door. My boots creaked on the wooden floor, and I winced at the sound. I pushed the door open slowly, holding my breath.

There, by my open suitcase, was a man. He was rummaging through my things, his back to me. His clothes were dirty, his hair matted, and he smelled faintly of sweat and smoke. My stomach dropped.

“Hey!” I shouted, gripping the poker tighter.

He spun around, eyes wide with surprise. For a split second, we stared at each other. His face was weathered, with a scruffy beard and a scar across his cheek. Then he bolted, shoving past me so hard I stumbled against the wall. The poker slipped from my hand and clattered to the floor. I scrambled up and ran after him, but by the time I reached the porch, he was gone, swallowed by the dark forest.

I stood there, panting, my mind racing. Who was he? A thief? A squatter? I went back inside and checked my suitcase. My wallet was missing—cash, cards, everything. My phone was still in my pocket, but when I pulled it out, the screen showed 5% battery and no signal. I couldn’t call for help.

I remembered the app mentioning a small town about twenty miles back. If I could get to my car, I could drive there and find a police station. I grabbed my keys and ran outside, but when I turned the ignition, the engine sputtered and died. I tried again. Nothing. The battery was dead, though I could’ve sworn it was fine when I arrived.

Panic started to set in. It was fully dark now, the forest a wall of black around the cabin. I went back inside, locking the door and dragging the sofa in front of it for good measure. My phone died completely, leaving me in the flickering light of the fire. I sat on the couch, clutching the poker, every creak of the cabin making me jump.

Then I heard it—footsteps outside, crunching on the gravel. Slow, deliberate steps, circling the cabin. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might burst. I strained to listen, hoping it was an animal, but then I heard a low whisper, too faint to make out words. Was it the man from before? Was he back with others?

I crept to the window, peering through a gap in the curtains. I couldn’t see anything, just darkness. The footsteps stopped, and for a moment, there was silence. Then a loud bang on the door made me jump back. The sofa shuddered but held.

“Who’s there?” I called, my voice shaking.

No answer, just another bang, harder this time. I backed away, gripping the poker so tightly my knuckles turned white. I scanned the room for another way out. There was a small window in the bedroom, barely big enough to squeeze through. I ran to it, fumbling with the latch. It opened with a creak, and I looked out. The drop was only a few feet to the ground, manageable.

Another bang on the door, and I heard wood splintering. I didn’t wait to see what would happen next. I climbed through the window, scraping my arm on the frame, and landed hard on the grass. I didn’t stop to check for injuries—I just ran, plunging into the forest, the poker still in my hand.

Branches scratched my face as I stumbled through the dark, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I didn’t know where I was going, just that I had to get away. The forest was a maze, and I kept tripping over roots and rocks. Behind me, I heard shouts, faint but growing closer. I ducked behind a tree, crouching low, trying to quiet my breathing.

The voices passed, moving deeper into the woods. I waited, counting to a hundred in my head, before creeping back toward the road. It took what felt like hours, but I finally saw the outline of my car. I didn’t dare try to start it again. Instead, I followed the road on foot, keeping to the shadows, praying I’d find help.

Dawn was breaking when I saw headlights in the distance. A pickup truck slowed as it approached, and I waved frantically. The driver, an older man with a kind face, rolled down his window.

“You okay?” he asked, eyeing my disheveled state.

I poured out the story—the cabin, the intruder, the dead car. His expression darkened.

“That place hasn’t been rented out in years,” he said. “Folks around here know it’s been taken over by squatters. They’ve been trouble for a while.”

He drove me to the town, where I reported everything to the police. They said they’d investigate, but warned that the squatters were hard to track down. Later, I checked the travel app, but the listing was gone, like it had never existed.

The man, who turned out to be the real property owner, explained that someone must have hacked the app or created a fake listing. He apologized profusely, offering to cover my losses, but the money didn’t matter. I was just glad to be alive.

I never used that app again. Now, I double-check every booking, call the host directly, and always have a backup plan. That night in the mountains taught me that technology can fail you when you need it most, and sometimes, the scariest things are the ones you can’t see coming.





# ""The Itinerary"":

I’d always been a bit of a loner, so the idea of a solo trip to Europe both thrilled and scared me. I wanted everything to go smoothly, so when I found a travel app with glowing reviews, I thought it was perfect. It promised cheap flights, cozy hotels, and personalized itineraries. I downloaded it, eager to plan my dream vacation to Paris.

I entered my details: name, address, passport number, credit card info. The app’s sleek interface assured me my data was “encrypted and secure.” I booked a flight and a hotel in the heart of Paris, near the Louvre. The app even suggested cafés and museums based on my love for art. I felt ready.

A few days before my trip, my phone pinged with an email. The sender was blank, and the subject read, “See You Soon.” I opened it, and my stomach dropped. It was a photo of me, standing outside my apartment, taken from across the street. I didn’t remember anyone taking it. The message below said, “Paris will be fun.” My hands shook as I deleted it, thinking it was a prank.

More emails came. “I know where you’re going.” “Can’t wait to meet you.” Each had a new photo—me at the grocery store, me walking my dog. I checked the travel app, but there was no customer service contact, just a chatbot that kept saying, “All bookings are final.” I tried replying to the emails, but they bounced back. I told myself it was just spam and focused on my trip.

When I landed in Paris, I was tired but excited. I took a taxi to the hotel address the travel app gave me. The driver dropped me off at a quiet street, but there was no hotel—just an empty lot with a faded construction sign. I double-checked the app. The address had changed to a different hotel, one I hadn’t picked, in a part of the city I didn’t know. I called the app’s support number, but it was disconnected. My emails from the travel app had vanished from my inbox.

My phone was at 10% battery, and I was alone in a foreign city. I found a small café nearby to charge my phone and think. As I sipped coffee, I noticed a man across the room. He wore a dark coat and stared at me with a cold, unsettling smile. When our eyes met, he stood and started walking toward me.

I grabbed my bag and bolted out the door. I glanced back—he was following me, his pace quickening. My heart pounded as I ran through crowded streets, dodging tourists and vendors. I turned into a narrow alley and hid behind a dumpster, my breath ragged. His footsteps echoed closer, then stopped. I held my breath, praying he’d leave. After a long silence, the footsteps faded.

I needed help. I remembered Clara, a friend I’d met on a travel forum. We’d never met in person, but she lived in Paris. I called her, my voice shaking.

“Clara, it’s me,” I said. “I’m in trouble.”

“What’s wrong?” she asked, her voice sharp with concern.

I told her about the emails, the fake hotel, the man following me. She gasped. “Stay where you are. I’m coming to get you.”

I gave her the street name and waited, scanning the alley for any sign of the man. Clara arrived 20 minutes later, her face pale. She was tall, with short brown hair and worried eyes.

“We need to get you somewhere safe,” she said, grabbing my arm.

As we walked to her apartment, she explained, “I’ve heard about that travel app. It’s a scam. They collect your data—passport, credit cards, everything—and sell it. Sometimes they lure people to fake addresses for worse things.”

My blood ran cold. “Like what?”

“Robbery, kidnapping, who knows,” she said. “They target solo travelers like you.”

We reached her small apartment near the Seine. I started to relax, sipping tea she made me. Then came a loud knock on the door. Clara peeked through the peephole and froze. “It’s him,” she whispered.

Before we could react, the door burst open. The man from the café stood there with two others. One held a knife, its blade glinting. “Give us your passport and cards,” he growled, pointing at me.

Clara stepped forward. “Leave her alone,” she said, her voice steady but scared.

The man laughed. “Stay out of this, or you’re next.”

I fumbled for my phone, trying to dial the police without them noticing. My hands trembled. Just then, laughter echoed from the street—a group of tourists passing by. The men exchanged glances, nervous.

“Let’s go,” one muttered. They backed out, slamming the door.

Clara locked it and turned to me. “We’re going to the police. Now.”

At the station, I told the officers everything. They took notes, their faces serious. “We’ve seen this before,” one said. “These apps can be fronts for criminal networks.” They arranged for me to stay in a safe house, a small apartment outside the city.

That night, alone in the safe house, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak made me jump. I deleted the travel app and changed my passwords, but the fear lingered. Those emails, that man’s face—they haunted me. I learned later the police were investigating, but the app’s creators were hard to trace, hidden behind fake names and servers.

I cut my trip short and flew home. Now, I double-check every app, every booking. But sometimes, when my phone pings, I freeze, wondering if it’s him, watching me still.





# ""No Signal, No Escape"":

I’ve always loved hiking, chasing the thrill of new trails and untouched scenery. When I heard about a travel app called TravelApp, which promised to uncover hidden gems off the beaten path, I couldn’t wait to try it. Users raved about its ability to find secret spots, and with glowing reviews, it seemed perfect for my weekend trip to Redwood National Park. I wanted a quiet trail, far from the usual tourist crowds. The app suggested “Whispering Pines,” a path through ancient redwoods leading to a hidden waterfall. It sounded like a dream.

I packed my backpack with water, snacks, and a first-aid kit, made sure my phone was fully charged, and set off early Saturday morning. The drive to the park was smooth, but when I reached the trailhead marked by TravelApp, I noticed something odd. The parking lot was empty, and there were no signs for “Whispering Pines.” I checked the app again, and it insisted this was the right spot. Shrugging it off, I figured it was just a lesser-known trail. I laced up my hiking boots, adjusted my backpack, and started following the app’s directions.

The trail began as a clear path winding through towering redwoods. But after about a mile, the trail faded, replaced by thick underbrush. The app’s voice calmly instructed, “Continue straight for 0.8 miles.” I pushed through, branches scratching my arms, but trusted the app. After all, it had thousands of five-star reviews.

Then I hit a fork in the path. The app said, “Take the left fork in 100 feet.” But there was no left fork—just a wall of thorny bushes. To the right, a faint path snaked through the trees. Confused, I hesitated. Maybe the app meant the right path? I tried to push through the bushes, but they were too dense, snagging my clothes and drawing blood. I took the right path instead, hoping it would reconnect.

After what felt like hours, I stumbled into a clearing. In the center stood an old, abandoned cabin, its windows boarded up, the door hanging off its hinges. My stomach twisted. This didn’t look like part of any hiking trail. The app still urged, “Proceed straight for 1.2 miles.” I glanced at the cabin, its dark windows like empty eyes, and hurried past, my heart beating faster.

The forest grew denser, the trees blocking out most of the light. It was only midday, but it felt like dusk. I checked my phone—no signal. My battery was at 60%. I kept walking, but the path was gone, forcing me to climb over fallen logs and wade through shallow streams. My boots were soaked, and my legs ached. The app’s directions grew erratic, telling me to turn where there were no turns.

Then I heard it—a low, guttural growl. I froze, my breath catching. Was that an animal? I scanned the trees but saw nothing. “Just your imagination,” I whispered to myself, but my hands shook as I gripped my phone. I hurried on, the growl echoing again, closer now. My pulse raced. I needed to get out of here.

I opened TravelApp, but the screen flickered, the map glitching. My battery was down to 20%. Desperate, I turned back, trying to retrace my steps, but the forest looked the same in every direction—endless trees and shadows. I couldn’t find the clearing or the cabin. Panic clawed at my chest. I was lost.

Stumbling forward, I tripped over a rusted metal sign half-buried in the dirt. I brushed off the moss and read, “Danger: Unstable Terrain. Do Not Enter.” My blood ran cold. The app had led me into a restricted area? I looked around and saw cracks in the ground, sinkholes hidden by leaves. One wrong step could send me plummeting.

The growl came again, louder, closer. I spun around and saw yellow eyes glowing in the bushes. A mountain lion, crouched low, its muscles tense. My heart pounded as I remembered what to do: make yourself big, make noise. I raised my arms and shouted, “Get back! Go away!” My voice cracked, but I kept yelling.

The lion didn’t move. It stared, unblinking, its tail twitching. I backed away slowly, eyes locked on it, praying it wouldn’t pounce. Then I turned and ran, branches snapping under my feet, my lungs burning. I didn’t care where I was going—just away from those eyes.

I ran until I collapsed against a tree, gasping for air. When I looked up, I was back at the abandoned cabin. Impossible. I’d been running in the opposite direction. My phone was at 5% now, the screen barely responsive. I sat on the cabin’s sagging porch, trying to calm my racing heart. Maybe I could wait here until morning, hope a ranger found me.

Then I heard voices—faint, human, coming from the trees. Relief washed over me. “Hello?” I called, standing up. “Is anyone there?”

The voices stopped. I called again, “Please, I’m lost!”

Silence. Then, footsteps crunching on leaves. A figure emerged from the shadows—a man in tattered clothes, his face smeared with dirt, his eyes wild. He held a knife, its blade glinting faintly.

“Who are you?” he rasped, stepping closer.

I backed up, my voice trembling. “I’m lost. My app—TravelApp—it led me here. I just want to get back.”

He laughed, a harsh, barking sound. “TravelApp? That app’s been sending people here for months. You’re not the first.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, my throat dry.

He grinned, showing yellowed teeth. “Lost hikers make easy pickings. Nobody knows you’re out here.” He lunged, grabbing my arm with a grip like steel.

“Let go!” I screamed, twisting free. I stumbled back, but he was faster, blocking my path to the trees.

“You’re not going anywhere,” he growled, raising the knife.

I bolted toward the cabin, slamming the door shut behind me. The smell of mold and decay hit me, and in the dim light, I saw something in the corner—human bones, scattered across the floor. My scream caught in my throat. This wasn’t just a cabin. It was a trap.

The man pounded on the door. “Open it, or I’ll break it down!”

I scanned the room, spotting a trapdoor in the floor. Maybe it led to a way out. I yanked it open, revealing a dark, narrow tunnel. The pounding grew louder, the door splintering. I had no choice. I climbed down, the air cold and damp, and pulled the trapdoor shut.

The tunnel was pitch-black, my phone’s light barely cutting through the darkness. My battery was at 2%. I crawled forward, the walls closing in, my breath echoing. Behind me, I heard the trapdoor creak open. He was coming.

I crawled faster, ignoring the pain in my knees, until I hit a dead end—a pile of rocks blocking the way. I was trapped. Footsteps echoed closer, and I heard his voice, low and mocking. “No way out, hiker.”

My phone died, plunging me into darkness. I pressed myself against the rocks, heart pounding, as his footsteps stopped right behind me. I braced for the worst, my mind racing with regret. Why had I trusted that app?

Suddenly, a loud crack echoed through the tunnel—not from him, but from above. The ground shook, and rocks tumbled down, blocking the tunnel behind me. I heard him shout, then silence. The unstable terrain had collapsed, trapping him—or worse.

I clawed at the rocks in front of me, desperate, until my fingers found a gap. I pushed through, emerging into the forest. Dawn was breaking, and in the distance, I saw a real trail sign: “Visitor Center, 2 miles.” Tears streamed down my face as I stumbled toward it.

At the visitor center, I told the rangers everything. They searched the area but found no cabin, no man, no bones. It was like the forest had swallowed it all. They said the “Whispering Pines” trail didn’t exist in their records. The app had led me somewhere it shouldn’t have.

I deleted TravelApp and warned everyone I knew. I still don’t know if it was a glitch or something more sinister, but I’ll never trust a navigation app again. The scratches on my arms, the bruise on my head, and the memory of those bones remind me: technology can lead you straight into danger if you let it.",1,1751338943.0,horrorX,2,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best French vanilla cappuccino mixes stand out due to a combination of factors, including flavor profile, ingredients, ease of preparation, and overall value.

**Flavor Profile:** A great French vanilla cappuccino mix should capture the classic flavors of rich coffee, creamy milk, and sweet vanilla. The vanilla flavor should be authentic and not artificial or overpowering. Blends that strike a perfect balance between these flavors will provide the most satisfying and enjoyable drinking experience.

**Ingredients:** The quality of ingredients plays a vital role in the taste and texture of the cappuccino. Premium mixes use real milk powder (or suitable vegan alternatives like coconut or oat milk), high-quality coffee extract, and natural vanilla flavoring.

The instructions should be clear and straightforward,allowing you to prepare a delicious cappuccino in minutes with minimal effort. Packaging that allows for easy scooping and portioning is also a plus.

The mix should contain ingredients that promote foam formation when mixed with hot liquid. some mixes even include extra foaming agents or stabilizers for a longer-lasting and more luxurious foam.

**sweetness Level:** Preferences for sweetness vary greatly, so the sweetness level of the mix is an important consideration. Some mixes are heavily sweetened, while others are more subtly sweet, allowing you to adjust the sweetness to your liking with added sugar or sweetener. Brands that offer both regular and sugar-free options cater to a wider range of consumers.

**Packaging and Shelf Life:** The packaging should be designed to protect the mix from moisture and light, preserving its freshness and flavor.

You can adjust the strength of the coffee by adding more or less mix, experiment with different types of milk (dairy, almond, oat, etc.), and add extra ingredients like chocolate syrup, whipped cream, or spices to create your own unique cappuccino creations.

**consistent Results:** With a good cappuccino mix, you can achieve consistent results every time. Unlike homemade cappuccinos,wich can vary depending on brewing techniques and milk frothing skills,a pre-mixed powder ensures a reliable and predictable outcome in terms of flavor and texture.

1loqz6v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loqz6v,"32F, Ohio","About Me:
I’m into abstract painting, drawing flowers, and slowly turning my house into something that feels like the English countryside (or at least a Pinterest version of it). I love vanilla lattes, trying new coffee shops, and wandering through art museums—even if no one wants to read the placards with me.

I’m sarcastic and a little sassy by nature, but never mean. I’m also an introvert (INTJ) who loves quiet, cozy spaces and real conversation over small talk.

I love clean sheets, fireflies at dusk, and being at home. I’m not someone who’s constantly planning my next trip, but I’d love to visit the Cotswolds or explore the Pacific Northwest someday.

Unpopular opinion: the top sheet should absolutely be tucked in at the foot of the bed.

Jesus is everything to me. I get it wrong more than I’d like, but I know I’m loved, forgiven, and not walking through life alone

What I’m Looking For:
Someone who genuinely loves Jesus and shows it in how they treat people. I’m drawn to guys who are steady, kind, and thoughtful—bonus if you’re into tech or fixing things. Curiosity is attractive. 

I’d love someone who shares what they’re into and takes an interest in what I care about too. You don’t have to love art museums or hikes, but I hope you’d come along anyway sometimes. Also, you should probably be able to handle a little sass.

I’m looking for something honest, solid, and centered around Jesus. Ultimately my best friend. ☺️

He is an indoor cat but is given various forms of enrichment, including going outside on a harness, and doesn't show signs of stress other than the spraying. He's also been marked healthy by the vet and doesn't spray or pee anywhere else outside the litterbox.

A while ago I noticed he'd begun spraying by the front door, and would go back no matter how much I cleaned and removed the scent. I realised that one of the local neighbourhood cats (also male, not sure of age) has been peeing on the outside of my door when I caught him in the act one day. It turns out they've been having this back and forth of territorial marking. I'm concerned because not only does it make the place stink of pee, but it must be stressing my boy out.

I've tried physically blocking my cat's access to the front door, but this can only be effectively done when someone is home because of course we can't place anything directly against the inside of the door from the outside. I've also tried leaving a pot of coffee grounds near the door as I've heard the smell is a deterrent. 

Is there anything I can do to truly stop this? I assume the neighbour's cat would have to stop spraying on the outside of the door, but I have no idea how to stop him. I live in a terraced house with neighbours' front doors right next to mine, so something like a motion-sensor sprinkler isn't an option. I also don't personally know his owners, I just know they live on a nearby street.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I've looked at some of Jackson Galaxy's content but haven't found a solution to this specific problem. ",1,1751338611.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

I'm a flight simmer, so when my PC is running, it's usually utilizing 90% of the GPU (4K TAA). I have an eye on my temps, and they're more than okay, nothing over mid-70s. Yesterday, my first day with the card, I did a flight, and in the sixth hour, my breaker flipped while my lights were on (I'll get to this). This was super unusual, I was running a 5080 before, and had never run into these issues. I have an ATX 3.1 1000V power supply with a dedicated 12V cable, and no individual cable seemed hotter than the rest, so none of that classic 5090 drama. I know which outlets run on my breaker, and I unplugged everything but my two monitors, my pc, my router, and my Alexa; that's it. Everything went smoothly. Today I was doing another flight, around four hours in, but then, as soon as I turned the lights on, the split second I did, everything went dark. My Hue lightbulbs have been acting strangely recently (one of them sometimes flickers, changes color, and is never the same color as the other lightbulb on the same setting). So, at this point, I assumed I had found the cause of the issue, a faulty lightbulb that's causing an arc, setting my AFCI off. However, I experimented. I went into the game, loaded into the most intensive place I could, stayed there for around 20 minutes with my GPU running at 99%, and slowly started plugging things back in. My kettle, my coffee grinder, almost everything I thought was causing a circuit overload. I even turned them on. Nothing, no issues. Then, towards the end, I expected that when my lights turned on, it'd go dark. But they didn't. My lights were on, everything was plugged in, my game was running great, and I was pulling so much power from my circuit with 0 issues. This was a stark contrast to having around 70% GPU util and the power cutting from me turning the lights on. The only thing I did in between after the second trip was to click the white ""test"" button on my 15a AFCI breaker. As of now, I can't reproduce the issue, but I was just wondering if anyone else with this type of hardware has ran into this type of stuff and how I can mitigate it. Is it possible that the ""test"" button does something like reset the sensitivity of the AFCI? Is it possible that my lightbulbs may just arc at random points in time?

1loqwiv,https://i.redd.it/tptsol6rg6af1.jpeg,Local SEO Strategies for Edmonton Entrepreneurs,"For people who own a business in Edmonton, being found online in your area is not just some big word — it really matters if you want to grow. More and more, people use Google to look for things close by... so showing up high on that list can be what helps you win or just get by. And with more people starting businesses in the city, it’s getting harder. So, if you want to stand out, you need to use smart and good ways to show up first when people look you up near them. Here’s what you should do.

Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GBP)

Your Google Business page is often what people see first—sometimes, it’s all they’ll see before picking up the phone or coming by. First step: say this page is yours and prove it. Make sure your name, where you are, and your phone are right and the same everywhere you show up online.

Add a good line or two about what you do, using words people in your town search for—like “Edmonton yard work” or “Downtown Edmonton food.” Put up great photos often. Change your hours and what you offer when it’s needed, like for holidays... or when days get cold. This tells both Google and people looking for you that your place is open, real, and ready to help. Not a bad look.

Local Keyword Targeting: Think Like an Edmontonian 

Winning at local search means you gotta know how people in Edmonton look for things online. Try tools like Google’s one for finding words—or Ubersuggest. See which words people use a lot in your town. Go for longer words that sound like real questions in your area, like ""best plumber near South Edmonton"" or ""Edmonton home fixer people.""

Then, just drop those words into your main pages, question pages, and blog stuff. Like, you could write something called ""Top Winter Roof Tips for Edmonton Homes""—that’ll hit both local people and what they’re needing now. And that’s just what Google likes… easy win.

Build Local Citations and Directory Listings
Mentions.

When your business gets named on good sites—help more people find you and trust you. First, go to big Canada sites like Yelp, YellowPages, 411, and ProfileCanada. If you do special work, like teeth, building, or care, put your name on sites for those, too.
You have to be the same everywhere. Names and numbers that don’t match can mess things up and push you down. So, check every single one—don’t miss any.

Get Local Reviews and Respond to them.

Customer reviews not only influence potential buyers but are also a confirmed ranking factor for Google’s local search results.
Encourage your satisfied clients to leave reviews on your Google Business Profile. Make it easy by sending direct links or follow-up emails. Always respond thoughtfully to both praise and criticism.
This shows you value feedback and reinforces your credibility.
You can even repurpose glowing reviews as testimonials on your website or social media platforms, adding social proof and trust.

Create Edmonton-Focused Content That Resonates.

One of the best ways to improve your local SEO is by creating content that reflects your deep ties to the Edmonton community. This isn’t just about dropping in keywords — it’s about showing real local engagement.
Write blog posts that speak to local challenges, like how to prepare your home for harsh Edmonton winters, or highlight events such as the K-Days Festival or the Old Strathcona Farmers' Market. Build neighborhood-specific pages that cater to areas like Mill Woods, Whyte Ave, or St. Albert, helping your site show up in hyperlocal searches.
You can also boost credibility by interviewing local experts, featuring customer stories, or showcasing collaborations with other Edmonton businesses. Not only does this content connect with your audience, but it also supports Google’s E-E-A-T standards — proving your experience, expertise, authority, and trustworthiness in the region.

Make Sure Your Website Shines on Mobile 
It’s no secret.

Edmontonians are searching on their phones more than ever. Whether someone’s looking for a nearby coffee shop or a same-day electrician, if your site isn’t mobile-friendly, you’re losing out.
Ensure your website loads quickly and looks great on all screen sizes. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix any slowdowns. Buttons should be easy to tap, text should be readable without zooming, and your contact info should be front and center.
Remember, a seamless mobile experience not only improves user satisfaction but also boosts your ranking in local search results.

1loqurm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loqurm,Beggars can't be choosy,"My mom (68) sprained 2 tendons while at my grandpa's (93) graveside service.😔🤕 

He was an amazing man. He was an actual genius 🧐 He cowrote engineering math textbooks used by MIT and Mercer University. He was on an engineering team that designed and fabricated a solar car for the SunRayce, in '92 I believe. Man, I could go on for days. He will be missed but not for a generation or two 😉

Our family is myself (52F), my youngest son (23) and my mom. We all came home from the funeral weekend in relatively good spirits. He knew he was going, we knew he was going, his doctors knew he was going and thankfully he lived in a state where he could choose when to die. There was no drama, very little pain and with the amazing technology we have today (thanks to people like Gpa) he got to say goodbye to every person that he held dear in this life.

It was actually pretty neat.

We're sad but we're good. Mom's on crutches but she can work from home and is all cozied up in her bed and we're taking good care of her. I'm the head nurse/café and my son is the heavy lifting nurse. My mom is nowhere near heavy but I only have one working arm at the moment and that's a whole other story so... We got this.

On 6/19, I awaken at 6:19 am to the sound of my mom yelling. Not really screaming...wth am I hearing?? Jump outa bed, almost ran my son over and find her on the floor in the Not Dining Room (iykyk). 
She had stumbled with her crutches in the living room on the way to letting her dog outside and get some coffee. (Mom had been recuperating nicely and had started venturing out and hanging in the living room.) She managed to ricochet about 11 ft before she lost the fight and went down. 
When I come around the corner and see her on the floor she says, ""I think it's broken."" I can see a bit of blood on the floor. Shes nowhere near death's door but the amount of blood is a little concerning. So, I look and she has a clean split about an inch long but all the way through. ""Yep, you're gonna need stitches, Mom.""
She says, ""I think I did an Allen (nrn my eldest 28M)"". Oh crap! Me, ""Mom, did you hit your head?""
Mom, ""No, I think I broke my elbow.""
Me: 🤬
Mom moves her arm a little. ""Nope, not doing that again. Yep, I did an Allen. It's broke."" Guess what my eldest did a little over a year ago? 🤦‍♀️

Bear with...

By the time all is said and done, she has her left foot in a boot, her right foot is bruised and has a couple of swollen toes and her right arm now has a bracket and 4 screw. Oh! And 3 stitches. 
After a week in the hospital, our options are a wheelchair or a rehabilitation center. The kind that you stay at until you can safely navigate your own home. 

Our house isn't exactly wheelchair friendly. Its a small house with 3 adults and 4 obnoxious pets and we've lived here for 40 years. That's why we have a Not Dining Room (iykyk).

So...she's in rehab. And she hates it. The facility is half rehab clinic and half long term patient care. The biggest issue is is that they treat everybody like a dementia/alzheimer patient, which is annoying as heck after a few days. The woman works at a global card manufacturing company. Her plant printed the original Pokémon cards in the US back in the late 90s! She works in the CAD/prepress/ design department. Yeah, still works and the staff was treating her like she is one of their dementia patients. 
And don't get me started on the food. Dietician on staff my ...😡

She's done. 

So we figured out a way to get her home and make it safe. She reached out to her church group and already have a wheelchair on the way. I've measured spaces and we're moving furniture around. Oh! And a guy in her group, that we had just helped by sending homemade potato soup (and I'm a damned good cook) just happened to have a couple of extra safety bars and was more than happy to come install them. 
More than happy. You could see how much joy this older man got from being able to reciprocate the care that we had shown him. And I thanked him profusely for doing so. I really want to get my Mom out of there. (That food is atrocious.)

I can't wait until she is all better and I can remove these things 🤭

If she doesn't dislocate her shoulder first while trying to get off of the potty 🤦‍♀️

🤷‍♀️ We got this.

Out of all the patients at Brookhaven Psychiatric Hospital, it’s these three that has the Director in a tizzy. James and Maria are urbexing the abandoned building to track down a wayward Laura. Whilst trawling its four floors looking for keys, codes, and puzzle items, we pick up important context clues that explain what happened to each patient, and why they matter. 

Three patient files are found in the Director’s Office:

* Patient #0050, in room C1.
* Patient #0090, in room D1. 
* And Patient #0130, initially housed in room S1, but later moved to L1. 

Each patient has their own unique symptoms, diagnosed treatment regimes, and living conditions:

Patient #0050 has sudden aggressive outbursts, and has both visual and auditory hallucinations. His file has the most written corrections and agitated notes from the Director - his social skills had been improving and mood swings diminished, but then mysteriously regressed. Water-based therapies “used” to have a calming effect. His room is small, bare, and has unique bars over the door window. 

Patient #0090 requires constant surveillance, which likely refers to a high risk of self-harm. He refuses food and water, requiring forced feeding and bathing, and has trouble sleeping even with medication. Written notes on the file say in all caps, “delusions persist”. His room is on the third floor, across from the radiography, and is locked with a combination dial lock, not just a door key.  

Patient #0130 suffers from extreme generalized anxiety that has evolved into “full-blown paranoia”, exacerbated by visual hallucinations. Her medication dosage has recently been increased, and she can’t be left alone so she was moved to the large L1 room, whose key you need to first get from the Nurse’s Lounge. There, under the gentle care of (presumably) a nurse, she has found some relief and even offered a smile. 

I’ve used specific pronouns for each patient, because as you traverse the hospital, you find notes and memos recalling various actions of the three. The first two are described using the “he” pronoun, and the third is explicitly described as a “girl”. 

Using context clues from their files, you can gather up the rest of Brookhaven Hospital’s notes and environmental storytelling, and piece together a bigger, clearer picture. From there, we can assign them each of the Patient Medical Bracelets, and also which of the three represent James, Eddie, and Angela. 

Patient #0050, who has “a family to feed”, at one point causes something called “Incident #071”, where he had suddenly sprinted from the pool, through the garden, and into the pharmacy, cutting himself in the process and leaking blood everywhere, dropping the pool pump Maintenance Key into the pharmacy’s floor drain. In an interview interrogating him about this incident, he describes being in the middle of a pool hydrotherapy regime when he felt a “him” stare from very close, prompting him to book it with this “him” still at his heels. *“So I made him stop. Now I’m empty again.”* He then asks to be taken back to the pool. 

[Signed in the same color ink as its written corrections.](https://preview.redd.it/mbqfs0otb6af1.jpg?width=444&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0196c0a528527845516bd111e8232c237573ad5e)

You find this written transcript by looking behind a conspicuous poster taped to the wall of his room, where an eye has been drawn and a small hidey-hole chiseled into the pupil. And when you drain the pool, that same eye motif has been scribbled multiple times upon the wall of the pool’s deep end, the biggest having a deeper, darker chiseled hole in its pupil that leaks a mysterious dark goop. There, you find the Bloodstained Bracelet; dotted with fresh red splatters and several lacerations into the plastic. 

He had written a 5-day journal on a piece of loose-leaf. It had rained the whole time. He stares out the window and talks with staff, mired in self-hatred. He describes himself as weak, a bother, selfish, how it’s all too hard, and wanting to run instead of standing his ground. He doubts the authenticity of the staff’s efforts to help him. By the 5th day, he’s told he’ll be discharged for some inexplicable reason and expected to go home soon. But he’s terrified, not happy. He can feel himself teetering on the edge of some precipice, and is unwilling to take the plunge. Immediately after James collects this journal page from some shed on the Hospital Roof, Pyramid Head jumpscares from behind him, grabs him by the throat, and slams him through the rickety wooden floor down to access a previously-inaccessible location. Thanks, old pal. 

Patient #0090 has the least amount of memos, either written by him or referring to him. His saga starts second-hand in the kitchen, where staff had taped a notice about a spreading mold problem next to a truly disgusting garbage disposal. James picks up a bottle of spray fungicide, which he will later use to clean up a moldy radiograph. You find this radiograph sitting in one of the three bathtubs of the Treatment Room, two of them filled with just the nastiest swamp ditchwater, the empty one lined with filth and barnacle-looking growths with the radiograph abandoned at the bottom. Black bugs crawl all over the room, dissipating after you pick up the radiograph and a familiar heavy scraping sound is heard somewhere else in the building.

In that same room, a note is found with unique handwriting, describing in detail being forced fed *“garbage and rotting meat, crawling with maggots”*, being bathed with *“blood and piss and bile”*, vomiting out of disgust, pleading for it all to stop. The writer then says that afterwards, “they lock me up with him \[...\] and the rot/it comes with him/it goes within/it becomes me”. Unless Brookhaven is pulling a Pennhurst, these have to be the ‘sensory delusions’ this patient suffers from, and why he resists food, water, and bathing. He feels unclean and tainted by a spreading filth exacerbated by food and water. In his room, James dramatically unveils the bedsheets to reveal a large, smelly, chunky stain on the mattress where the Filthy Bracelet is found. The black bugs crawl around here, too, and there’s the mold-like texture all over the walls and fixatives. 

Now, the radiograph you find is the last piece of an x-ray-themed puzzle with three radiographs backlit on the board, but the etched code is missing that fourth sheet. The radiographs are of: a skull with a healed childhood head trauma, a pelvis with an X near the crotch, a ribcage, and the hand with two “old finger fractures” on the left pinky. The marked pelvis refers to Angela and her abuse, the ribcage James and his affinity with drowning and suffocation, the skull we’ll touch on in a bit, and the fractured pinky hand with Eddie and his use of handguns.

Lastly, Patient #0130 writes one handwritten note, found near where the Marked Bracelet is; *“Why won’t they help me/why do they keep me in here with him”* in a very shaky hand. To get there, you first snag her room key from the Nurse’s Lounge (and next door in the Women's Locker Room is where someone stashed the hospital Shotgun in their locker), which reveals room L1 to be large and lined with white bedsheets and random furniture, like a makeshift storage room. A Mannequin enemy is shuffling quietly in the far background. Past the corner cubicle where you find a sympathetic note written by the girl’s caretaker, there’s a cute little pillow fort made out of a bedsheet tent, but it’s empty. 

You need to go past that to see a small, pried-open hole in the drywall perpendicular to the floor, where the sneaky Mannequin is spotted hiding and scurrying away before James himself has to squeeze inside. The hole is barely big enough for him, he ends up breaking through the smashed wood infrastructure and trapped between the walls, only escaping ‘cause there was an exit hole blocked by a storage closet. 

This leads to the Medical Records, where another pillow fort is found, and also where you get said Marked Bracelet and a shaky note. Finally, the Mannequin reveals itself to be killed. The bracelet has been crudely doodled on with what looks like black felt tip ink, there’s tight spirals and hatching. 

You put the three bracelets on one hand - the severed wrist and hand of what looks like a drowned cadaver because of its peeling skin - using the faint marks of blood, lacerations, black ink, and moldy crap that stains the corpse’s wrist to line them all up and reveal a numeric code. All three bracelets on one corpse’s wrist that bear traces of all their woes. 

https://preview.redd.it/96sy36zyb6af1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27bce954c2a7099716c284b5a3a20af42d8fcf17

The hand opens to a key, the key opens to a book spine puzzle of an aligned arrangement on the bookshelf revealing the decal of a lion devouring the sun, and a bunch of alchemical symbols. THEN you take all that, and input the numeric code into an esoteric safe translated into the book’s alchemical symbols: 92, 45, and 71 with the buttons for the Squared Circle/Philosopher’s Stone, Lead/Saturn, Iron/Mars, Gold/Sun, Quicksilver/Mercury, and Vitriol/sulfates. 

Inside? The Director left the key to the roof, and a note addressing the reader that *“their images have become blurry/melting together \[...\] not sure if I can do it/but maybe you can”*, and that the key will take us to where we need to go, but not necessarily where we want to be. 

The roof is where we get Patient #0050’s diary, and where Pyramid Head body slams us to meet Laura (and the Flesh Lips boss battle), by the way. As stated before, James had hit a dead end and wouldn’t have been able to progress without Pyramid Head lending him a hand. 

It’s no secret that Pyramid Head isn’t a true antagonistic force. He’s a dangerous one-hit-kill boss fight, but his actions all correlate to pointing James towards the ugly truth that he had forgotten. All three of Brookhaven’s patients make vague comments about a ‘him’ - #0050 feels like he’s watched and chased by ‘him’, #0090 gets locked up with ‘him’ and contracts his mold problems from this him, and #0130 questions why she’s trapped together with ‘him’. 

We may not have to like the heavy-handed method Pyramid Head employs, but sometimes the brutal truth is what’s needed to break through a foggy, broken mind. To quote from *Silent Hill’s* biggest cinematic inspiration *Jacob’s Ladder*, “If you're frightened of dying, and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. If you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the Earth.""

But this isn’t the end of the patient’s saga. Come the next level, it’s the same hospital but Overworld-toasty now. And there’s a new patient file: a Patient #3141, whose only symptom is “hyperfocus”, and a handwritten note to “STOP AT NOTHING”. This Overworld Hospital gives us a few new notes about all four patients, plus more environmental clues. There’s a lot of loose memos typed in typewriter font (and indeed, there was a typewriter on the Director’s office desk), one using the metaphor of a partnered dance to represent medical procedures, one a rambling promise for no more pain, one is on the back of a different handwritten note (or perhaps more accurately, a handwritten note was written on the back of this typed memo) that says *“So close.”* Another one that says they won’t rest and even forgot how to rest, one is titled ‘Dissociated Note’ and indeed is this wack paragraph that doesn’t make sense, and finally the last memo found in the Hospital is typed, *“It is done. Sick no more.”* Perhaps the fourth skull radiograph - the one with the healed childhood trauma scar - is meant to be this guy and his maniac drive to cure three specific wretches.

Now, we can assign the known cast members to the previous three patients. 

James is #0500:

* Affiliated with water.
* Has the chest - aka lungs - radiograph.
* Hallucinations and sudden, inexplicable spells of aggression.
* The eye symbol in his room and in the pool is on the same tombstone where the Book Of Crimson Ceremony is found in New Game+, for the Rebirth ending. 
* He’s got a family, according to his journal.
* This male patient writes about himself with very little esteem, and thinks of himself as a selfish coward.
* This journal is found within a neat little ‘Entry-Describes-Hesitating-Over-A-Precipice, Pyramid-Head-Throws-James-Off-The-Roof’ chain of events. 
* His Bracelet is stained with blood. 
* There’s jail-like bars on his door window. 
* The alchemical symbols of his section of code is the Philosopher’s Stone and Lead - a mythical substance that could turn base elements into valuable ones and grant eternal life, and the infamously heavy and poisonous metal.
* Has the most notes, memos, and clues, especially expanding to the Overworld level counterpart.
* And for some reason, the Director seems to be most obsessed with him. 

Eddie is #0090:

* Has an eating disorder and self-care problems.
* Has ‘sensory delusions’. All delusions involve the senses, his being all five and not just visions or auditory. 
* His moldy x-ray of an injured hand vs. Eddie’s affinity for handguns. 
* The school-like combination lock for his door, and not a proper key. 
* His nasty bracelet was found in the midst of his mattress mold stain - he either simply left this residue whilst lying there, or he melted away into goop. Keep in mind, his other symptom is insomnia. 
* The moldy bugs scurrying away from Pyramid Head’s scraping noise, and also from James’ flashlight. 
* His alchemical symbols of mercury and sulfates, both highly deadly in their vapor form.
* Him being introduced to James by throwing chunks into a toilet while a rotten body is stuffed into a fridge nearby, all in close hand with this emphasis on dirty bathwater and mold.
* Eddie’s boss fight being surrounded by refrigerated, butchered, hanging animal bodies as he reveals himself as an opportune murderer - the only one of the three with the most (theoretical) rotting corpses in his wake. 

And Angela is #0130:

* The female out of two males. 
* Paranoia and traumatized, only opening up to an implied female staff caretaker.
* Pillow forts and blanket shelters in her room. 
* Seemed to have broken through a wall to make a hole fit for a smaller figure, running to the floor below to make more pillow forts, this same path mimicked by a Mannequin monster from James’ perspective. 
* This is in comparison to Angela’s boss fight having tight, broken-through hidey-holes in the apartment walls that are lined with newspaper and house a teddybear toy, seemingly a manifestation of where Angela would hide from her family IRL.
* The radiograph of a pelvis/hip area, and a marked X at the bottom, close to the crotch. 
* Her written note about the ‘him’ is explicitly questioning the staff’s decision to keep them in the same area, as opposed to passively accepting ‘his’ presence like the other two. Like she knows there’s something especially off when you take into consideration her condition versus Pyramid Head’s attributes. 
* Her alchemical symbols of iron and gold, both male zodiac symbols, and amongst the most valuable. 
* Her bracelet has been defiled with purpose, not just incidentally splattered with blood or grown dirty with mold. 

And enter our surprise player, Patient #3141. I propose that this patient represents the hospital Director - going off of the symptoms and the typed font memos we find in the Otherworld - but there’s even more to it. Some clues point to #3141 also standing for James. Some point to a more meta ‘This Is You, The Player’ direction. Maybe he also represents the forces of Silent Hill itself. 

The Otherworld Hospital level takes place in the same building, but there’s a new puzzle to tackle, and the architecture has been altered. James needs to break three chained locks on a mysterious ornate box:

A numerical cylinder lock takes you past the Angela-Patient room of L1, to a suspiciously-quiet block of rooms where a diary page gives you clues concerning a handful of pills in the sink, a blinking light, and dreading when the clock strikes a certain hour. The handwriting of the diary being the same as the bloody gameplay hints you had found in the beginning of the game. When you rotate the clock hand to a specific hour, a deafening alarm draws swarms of enemies to you, like how you’d dread the return of an abuser coming home from work. 

An electronic pinpad has you trawl back to the Director’s Office and above it, to find an ECT device where Flesh Lips used to be, and it needs to be powered back up. The generator will be found after re-exploring the padded cellblocks and Radiography (where the bulletin will now only show the skull and hand, chains wrapped around the throat and wrist). Turning on the ECT machine will burn the combination numbers into the surface of the bed. 

And the actual keyhole of the box will take you to the James-Patient’s room area, where the eye graffiti has been obscured by its pupil-hole expanded to obscure it. Some rooms away sit a cowering dummy in a wheelchair. You use a mallet and orbitoclast set - lobotomy tools - to access its left eye socket and retrieve a Lapis Eye Key. Getting these tools requires a return to the kitchen and cafeteria area, now even grosser. 

So, you can see some connections already. But they’re seemingly not as self-contained to Angela, Eddie, and James. More accurately, they all pertain to James first and foremost, with some aside nods to the other two. The numerical cylinder lock answer takes place in the Angela-Patient area and has references to dreading the arrival of an hour signaling a change in the lighting and an antagonist force, but the note has handwriting laterally adjacent to James - the early-game street memos of Eastern Southern Vale were presumably written by the disfigured corpses lying nearby, all of them sharing James’ clothes and model. “YOU’VE BEEN HERE FOR TWO DECADES” indeed. 

[Dr. Walter Freeman described one 29-year-old woman as being, following lobotomy, a \\""smiling, lazy and satisfactory patient with the personality of an oyster\\"" who could not remember Freeman's name and endlessly poured coffee from an empty pot.](https://preview.redd.it/lqls9wbbd6af1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=175d711b1f0024a39177fe925d372493c1504bfa)

The electronic pinpad’s answer is where Eddie-Patient’s room is, plus also where the only few clues referencing #0090 were, but they also center around the Director’s Office and the Flesh Lips boss battle. The use of an ECT machine reminds us of an execution by electric chair, especially with the way they set it up in that room, all spotlit and hooked up like a spider’s web. Next to it, a staff’s note says that it was Patient #0050 (James) that had snuck into the room, and he also mysteriously knows how to turn it on. But notably, he was NOT scheduled for actual ECT treatment. You then flip the paper over to see the obsessive Director’s typed notes, *“So close. It will happen. Has to.”*

And you get the key by exploring the moldy kitchen area again, but the dummy itself sits where James-Patient’s room was. Much like how the in-game ECT method had been obsolete since the 1950’s, lobotomies had been obsolete since the 1960’s. Their modern evolutions (like TMS and Corpus Callosotomy) are much less violent and more effective, while their in-game counterparts would have been inhumane. Both were prescribed to mentally ill patients in vain, ill-informed efforts to reduce harmful symptoms of psychotropic disorders, but they were also done to ‘treat’ pandemic victims like tuberculosis patients, and also were a systematic abuse forced upon marginalized people - women, people of color, disabled people. ECT forces the brain to have seizures, while a lobotomy damages the frontal lobe. 

The town of *Silent Hill 2* has been dated to roughly be stuck in a late 1980’s-1990’s period, with a wall calendar dating to 1982 at the earliest, and the few computers resembling something between a Commodore 64 and a Packard Bell. There’s printed copy paper notes, but also typewriter ones. The pharmacy uses glass containers rather than the plastic amber vials of today. Cars are all real-world 70’s and 80’s models. Videotapes, VCRs, and camcorders weren’t mass market until the late 80’s. 

By the end of the 80’s, both the spike-through-the-eye lobotomy thing and the metal-colander-helmet method were long out of date. If the Otherworld Hospital wasn’t a complete Freudian hallucination dream journey to the center of the mind sequence, it’s conceivable that a crazed Director dragged out old tools from storage out of desperation. 

Either way, your given rando ‘knows’ that lobotomies and ECTs are one step above torturous mutilation. They were literal punishments in all but name. A cheating husband commits his wife to hide his infidelity, and she gets forever brain damaged. Incarcerated Black activists are arrested and institutionalized to have their skulls fried under the guise of ‘treating’ their ‘aggression’. You’re autistic and struggling because your parents insist on running the dishwasher every night at 7pm, boom. You’re a troubled teen ‘cause of domestic abuse, zap. You fight back against the bullies at school, bang. 

All three of the cast - James, Angela, and Eddie - might have been subject to these ‘treatments’ under different circumstances. Even the pills themselves could have been an abuse, as medications of the past could involve highly dangerous amounts of barbiturates, bromide, etc, leading to poisonings, addiction, cancer, and more. The punishment motif is clear. 

It’s also in these trappings of medical malpractice that we begin to really turn the spotlight solely on James, and shift away from Angela and Eddie. After going through all this rickamaroll to open this alleged miracle box, it’s unlocked to reveal … nothing. James’ expression is a clear “FML”, hilarious to see. Immediately afterwards, the curtain behind falls away to reveal the Lady Of The Door and her two rings being the true key forward. You do all this bullshit to try to find the solution, try to unravel the twists and turns of a troubled mind, and you don’t get an answer. James had been acting in the shoes of this Director. 

What does give James the true out? Finding a spider-adorned copper ring on a white linen covered pedestal and putting it on the right hand of the statue, and taking a skull-adorned lead ring from a rotten refrigerator and putting it on her left. The valuable and conductive copper one, analogous to marriage. Maria pops back up out of nowhere right after James takes it from its white pedestal, and he even spins around with a joyous “Mary!” at her voice. The heavy and poisonous lead one, Maria has to help you lift the lid off of a toppled fridge that resembles a metal sarcophagus, and she’s the one who spots the ring amongst its rotten insides, gives a quip about how ugly it looks, and hands it to James. Right before, James and Maria walk under a magically-raining hallway to the pool area. And right after, this lead ring goes on the left hand, which is traditionally the hand that bears the wedding ring.  

[\\""Not very cute, is it?\\"" she says, verbatim about James' marriage\/wife.](https://preview.redd.it/lndme93bc6af1.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934f72b0a5e88692890a7a1c897eae4dd440342a)

The door opens. The Director’s final note: *“It is done. Sick no more.”* Maria hesitates to follow him down, and for good reason, ‘cause this is where Pyramid Head chases her down and slays her. 

This was the true out. The true path forward, and a nod to James’ truth. If Pyramid Head isn’t actually an antagonistic force, Maria isn’t actually a helpful ally. For every path forward Pyramid Head surplexes you towards, Maria makes an effort to redirect you away. 

And there you have it. Those three patient files had plenty of significance, but ones that require a player to do some digging and re-digging to reveal. Like all fan theories, this is all largely speculation, and my conclusion is just my own. I do like the idea of a nonsentient Silent Hill having a bit of self-reflective irony in portraying itself as a struggling Director on the verge of a mental breakdown, trying its best to ‘cure’ its ‘patients’. Or would that be a reflection of James’ subconscious view of Silent Hill? 

I do not think Silent Hill is meant to be a sapient entity. I wouldn’t be surprised if James’, Eddie’s, and Angela’s experiences are great outliers, and Silent Hill’s weird powers are usually reserved for cult-affiliated people and them alone. I don’t think *Silent Hill’s* message is one of morals or redemption; Asia has Christian population percentages in the single digits, and game devs would most certainly draw from Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist, Shinto, and folk beliefs before they’d pull from a nebulous understanding of bible stuff.

Pyramid Head isn’t an individual. The various monster types aren’t species or races. Silent Hill 2 isn’t the literal. It’s a dream sequence. A look through the eyes of those enchanted.

1loqss4,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1loqss4/coffee_saga/,Coffee Saga,"This story spans years. My current roommate (28m) is one that I've lived with for four years now, split up. We lived together for two years then separately for a year and have now been living together again for two more years. 

We are friends but tend to have friction. He's unclean and needlessly rude at times but we're the kind of friends that fight and then go back to normalcy like it never happened. To be honest, I only moved back in with him out of necessity, but I can mostly deal with it. Until it comes to our coffee. 

When we lived together the first time, my parents got me a stovetop Moka pot for Christmas. I brought it home and started using it in the mornings. Not long after, my roommate asked to try some and I let him. It then became him asking if I had any leftover every single morning. And that turned into him asking me to just make enough for him to have some. And then him just using it without asking. At first I decide it wasn't a big deal, telling him he just had to pitch in for the coffee. But then it got worse.

He'd never clean the pot. Whenever I'd grab the pot in the morning, I'd find his cold, wet, gross coffee grounds leftover from the previous day. I confronted him and just asked him to rinse the pot out after he used it. At first he said he would, but never did. After repeated confrontations about it, he admitted he thought I was making a big deal out of nothing and that it didn't matter if he left the grounds in it. I told him it did matter to me and that I wanted him to do it. And he still never did. 

It got to the point of the Moka pot being stained inside and outside and smelling bad even after a cleaning. I eventually stopped using it altogether. When I moved out, I let him keep it. I was mad about all of it but at the end of the day I wasn't that pressed about keeping it, especially after it got gross.

Cut to a couple years later, and we move back in together. At the time, he was still using the crusty old Moka pot every morning, the one that my parents got me for Christmas. I had gotten myself a small pour over set that I would use from time to time, but I work at a coffee chain and would usually just get coffee at work. Eventually though I went back to school and decided to get myself a coffee machine. Nothing fancy, just a cheap coffee maker so that I could brew multiple cups at a time to sip on during days I was at home doing schoolwork. And I get free bags of beans from my job, so it seemed like a great idea. But then it started.

One day he asked if he could have what was leftover in the pot. I should have said no. But I didn't. A week later and he's expecting me to have enough brewed for him when he wakes up. Then he's brewing coffee for himself using my coffee maker and my beans when I'm not there, the Moka pot sitting unused in the cupboard. And again, I decided it wasn't a big deal. I got the beans for free anyway.

But hey guess what, he would never throw the filter full of grounds away. He'd never rinse the coffee pot out. He'd never even dump what was leftover. So I told him he needed to just throw the filter away and rinse the pot out after using it or he couldn't use it anymore. At which point he laughed in my face and told me ""nobody in the world rinses the coffee pot out after every time they use it."" And I told him I didn't care, it's my coffee machine and my coffee and if he wants to use it he needs to clean it. So then he started pointing out things in the apartment that we share that are his and saying I couldn't use them anymore. We fought and didn't talk for a day and then everything went back to how it was.

I decided to just try not to care but I always did. Especially considering how he started using more of the beans than me. And would then pester me to bring more home when we ran out. Eventually I told him he had to start buying his own coffee. Cue freak out. I'm selfish because I get it for free etc. I drop the subject. I stay mad and he stays getting my coffee.

I finally stopped though. I don't drink coffee at home. I don't bring beans home. He can use the dirty coffee pot all he wants if he buys beans  himself. It's not a win I guess but at least I'm doing it on my own terms. Am I the crazy one? Am I over-reacting? Should I share my free coffee unconditionally? I'm kidding, I know the answer, that's why I'm posting here. Just feels good to get it off my chest. A years long silent battle finally over. 

I have countless stories with this guy though. One time I came home to him napping while our kitchen ceiling had water streaming out of it. And when I asked why he came home from work, saw it, walked around it, didn't do anything, and took a nap, he got mad and said ""What would I have done?""

1loqsr9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loqsr9,AIO Boyfriend broke up with me for texting a male friend,"Me (F28) and my boyfriend(M38) started dating a few weeks ago. Last week, we went out to a coffee shop and everything seemed fine until I asked him to take pictures of me. He was obviously annoyed with me and questioned if I was really “interested in him”. After, we headed back to his place and talked a little. He decided he wanted to clean both of our cars. We then went out and cleaned our cars for about 30+ mins. We headed back inside and I began to watch YouTube on the TV. I pulled my phone out to check it and he started a conversation. I then realized every time I was on my phone he would start a conversation. He kept asking me if I was really interested in him or do I even care what he was  talking about. The thing is he wasn’t talking about much and would only say something if I got on my phone. I wasn’t even on my phone that much!! Fast forward to 3am I woke up and joined him in the living room as he was watching TV. Everything was going good until he noticed a text message on my phone. He was upset that I was texting a male friend, even saying it felt as if someone punched him in the chest. He asked if I was willing to show him the messages. I felt super uncomfortable and thought he was overstepping. Still, I agreed to show him the messages. The messages were a friendly conversation between best friend’s. He was angry after reading due to the time we were texting. My best friend works overnight and I so happen to be up and texted him back. Well, my bf did not care and asked me to leave at 4am. Two days later he broke up with me because he could not look past it. I am so sad and haven’t heard from him and he’s ignoring me. I would like to know if you guys believe he overreacted or do you guys believe he’s reasoning is valid?  ",1,1751338249.0,AmIOverreacting,15,1.0,False
1loqsmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1loqsmt/partner_search_fxa/,Partner Search | FXA,"She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

I've always had mood swings that weren't too bad, like I'd be happier for a couple hours out of the day, but it's been getting worse over the past 2 or 3 years. I started to experience my mood swings on a monthly basis, where for a month I'd be happy and motivated to get my life in order and would be really grateful for the people around me, and the month after I'd be reconsidering everything I'm doing in life and all the friendships I have, coupled with lots and anger and bitterness towards all my relationships and some SI, with small spurts of happiness lasting anywhere from 1-3 days. This year started off with a 3 month long depression followed by 2 months of, well not depression I guess. Starting at around mid-late May though it's just been nothing but depression, and the small bit of happiness I do get just feels like a baseline and nothing more, it'll only last me like 1-3 hours out of the day. The only thing that brings me anything close to ""true happiness"" anymore were the ADHD meds I've been trying (I started stimulants in February, my first one being ritalin, which made me practically hypomanic), and even then I still feel like shit on them. I can't engage in my hobbies anymore without feeling anything but anger, worry, and frustration and I'm pushing what little relationships I have left away from me. I quit my job earlier this month leaving on a very negative note (the work-environment caused by corporate was too much for me to handle), I'm taking a summer math class right now that I'm doing surprisingly well in but I think that's only because of my current medication (Dexedrine) I only take it when I have homework to do. Sometimes I'll take it if I'm really desperate to get my head to shut up but it rarely helps with that. 

I don't get it. I don't have issues with getting out of bed for the most part, and hygiene has never been an issue for me. Sometimes I'll forget to brush my teeth at night, but that's just from being tired from staying up. I've been getting coffee with my mom a couple times a week (I'm usually the one inviting her), and I'm kinda decent about running errands. I plan on going to a local thrift store tomorrow. But I just can't feel anything but either bitterness or emptiness for most of the day. I just started therapy a couple weeks ago but I haven't felt any better. Maybe my ADHD meds are making things worse/causing me to feel this way? I don't know. My psychiatrist suggested antidepressants/anxiety meds but after a bad experience I had with Wellbutrin 2 years ago, I'd really rather stay off them. Though recently it's been getting to the point where I'm desperate and might consider starting them. I know no one on this subreddit is gonna have the answers I need/want, I just want to put this out there if it'll make me feel a little bit better. It's so weird because I started the day off feeling meh, got coffee with mom, was feeling alright and an hour after I got home it was just nothing but negative thoughts and wanting to die until I started writing this, and now I'm at a baseline. And even then as I was writing this I could feel my mood fluctuate. I've had concerns that I might have some kind of underlying bipolar but I've never had a manic episode before.

I have two close friends and things are rough with both of them. One of them ... our friendship has been increasingly a weird mutual celebration of how special and complicated we are. And that's fine, we are both special, complicated people, but that's not all friendships should be. There should be much idle chatter over coffee as much as there are deep lifechanging conversations, and there hasn't been.

The other one, is in a circumstance. And I tried to force her to make good decisions to get out of her circumstance. And that was stupid. That's all there is to it. No good will ever come of forcing anyone to do anything.

The thing is I **know** it's possible for me to have a normal social life. I've done it before. Twice, actually. Both times my brain ruined it, once by unexpectedly deciding to go to law school and once because I embarassed myself because I couldn't get high (see my other posts) when everyone else could.

There's a pretty obvious solution -- go more places that have people. Try more activities, and keep building the personality I've been building which is interested, normal, and non-pushy. Making progress. Winning the argument. Getting better.

It's going to be okay. Both in regards to my friends and in general. But right now I'm lonely, and it sucks.

We're not talking shag carpets and velvet couches here, but rather things like a nubby linen throw on a simple sofa, a woven basket for storing blankets, or a ceramic vase with a matte finish.

Another thought is to play with natural materials. Think a live edge wood coffee table (if that fits yoru minimalist aesthetic), a sheepskin rug (a smaller one!), or even just incorporating house plants with different leaf textures and shapes. Light also plays a huge role; bouncing light off different surfaces can highlight subtle textures you already have.

My girlfriend thinks I overreacted but honestly I'm not sure.

I went to this local diner by myself around 2pm on Saturday. Nothing fancy, just wanted some pancakes and coffee. The place wasn't busy at all, maybe 3 other tables occupied. My waitress looked like she was in her early 20s, seemed nice enough when she took my order.

Everything was going fine until I needed to use the bathroom. It's one of those places where you have to walk past the kitchen area to get there. As I'm walking back to my table, I hear my waitress talking to another server near the kitchen. She's pointing in my direction and says something like ""see that guy over there? Total weirdo vibes. Keeps looking around all nervous and shit. Probably lives in his mom's basement.""

I froze. Like literally stopped walking. I have social anxiety and yeah, I probably do look around a lot when I'm eating alone because I get uncomfortable. But hearing someone just tear me apart like that when I'd been nothing but polite? That stung.

I went back to my table and finished my food in silence. When she brought the check, she was all smiles again asking if everything was okay. I just paid the exact amount on the bill and left. No tip.

Now here's where it gets complicated. My girlfriend found out what happened (I told her why I was upset) and she thinks I should have still tipped because ""that's her job and she probably makes like $3 an hour."" She says what the waitress said was wrong but I shouldn't have taken it out on her paycheck.

But I don't know man. I tip well usually, like 20% minimum. I've worked food service before so I get it. But this felt different. She was making fun of a paying customer for no reason other than I seemed awkward to her. That's not okay in my book.

Part of me wonders if I should have said something to her directly or asked for a manager, but confrontation makes my anxiety worse. Walking out without tipping felt like the only way I could respond.

Should I have sucked it up and tipped anyway, or was walking out justified?",12,1751337490.0,AITAH,27,0.83,False

Did you just pull a 6 star or 5 star piece and want to color match other parts of your outfit but the regular palettes just don't work? Well, this one's for you! I'll include visuals as well to make it easy to do! First, this requires X-palette unlocked. Don't fret, this can be F2P-friendly too! Let's say you have a 4-6 star item you want to style with, but you want to incorporate some 3 star item(s) in your fit, first, unlock X-palette on any of your 3 star pieces, then click X-Palette, then tap or click an empty area to back out of that part selection. Find your other piece you want to match the color from, then you copy the color code from that. After you do that  go back to your 3 star item (or any other item you unlock X-palette for) and paste the color code you just copied! Depending on the material the color should match exactly or you may need to make micro-adjustments on the color wheel. This is super helpful for those of us who want to perfectly match parts of our outfits or if you have that perfect shoe you want to match something else! Also, you don't NEED to unlock X-palette on the 4-6 star item to do this. Just open X-palette on the item you DO have it unlocked for and then you can freely select another item to grab the color code. Happy matching! :) I used this tip to match an unrelated skirt to a 6 star top at the end of the screenshots!",13,1751337489.0,lifemakeover,2,0.94,False

""Would you like something to drink?""

- ""Fresh fruits.""

""Do you have a favorite?""

When the customer finishes his filter-coffee, the waiter, feeling fulfilled, further queries:

- ""So, how was the coffee?""

- ""Freezing, feeble, fetid, filtered through a faulty filter, floating formicans, forming foolish fables.""

Then the waiter decides to challenge him to test how far he will go.

- ""What is your name?""

- ""Felipe Florêncio Farias Filho.""

- ""Where are you from?""

- ""Fortaleza.""

- ""Do you work?""

- ""Formerly a farrier.""

- ""Formerly.""

- ""And your wife?""

- ""Fell dead.""

- ""From what?""

- ""Listen here, if you say ten more words with the letter F, you can get up and leave without paying the bill.""

- ""Fantastic, friend! Forfeiting fees, freely, fairly, frequently, I'll forever frequent!""

We didn’t have rules. We had chaos, giggles, and an endless supply of energy. Our matches were daily rituals, usually ending with someone crying or something getting broken. That particular day started off like any other—pillows flying, feet thudding on hardwood floors, laughter echoing against the walls. But then came the fork. It sat innocently on the coffee table, left there after lunch. My brother, in the middle of our epic toddler skirmish, lunged for it—not out of malice, but with the wild creativity of childhood imagination. To him, the fork was a sword. A mighty weapon. Unfortunately, it didn’t stay imaginary. In one poorly aimed move, he jabbed it into the side of my head. There was no pain at first. Just confusion. Then warm liquid started dripping down the side of my face. I looked at my hand—red. Blood. A lot of it. My brother froze. I wailed. Blood hit the floor, the couch, the rug, my pajamas—everywhere. It was like a horror movie set designed by toddlers. My parents burst into the room and immediately panicked. My mom screamed. My dad scooped me up and wrapped my head in the nearest towel, yelling something like “WE NEED TO GO—NOW!” as he bolted to the car. At the ER, everything felt surreal. Bright lights, masked faces, cold fingers poking gently at my scalp. They stitched me up quickly, and gave me a bandage that I wore like a crown—proof I survived toddler warfare. Nurses gave me juice and stickers. I felt like a hero. My brother, on the other hand, faced serious consequences. He was grounded. No cartoons. No toys. Dessert? Forget it.

*Dragonfruit Iced Tea:* Oh, she stopped doing dance. 




*Mocha Latte:* No! Why? She was so talented and she seemed to really enjoy it, no? 


*Dragonfruit Iced Tea:* The environment was not our vibe. The moms would sit through every single practice watching and being passive aggressive. Lan wanted to take ballet and wasn’t interested in jazz or hip-hop. We caught a lot of weird flack about that. It’s like “I’m the paying customer here. Just give me the services I pay for.” At the end of the day, she’s a kid. I don’t want her working 12 hours a day between school and extra curriculars. 



*Mocha Latte:* That’s insane. It’s like something you’d see on TV. 


*Dragonfruit Iced Tea:* It was worse in a way because that stuff is staged and this was all real. 




*Mocha Latte:* Can’t you just go to a different studio? 


*Dragonfruit Iced Tea:* We tried the new one that just opened over there by the ShopRite. The instructors were perfectly nice girls but the rest, the students or rather their parents, it was more of the same. The parents were talking about “Oh she needs to do this and that or she’ll never be on broadway, she’ll never be in music videos.” One lady even talked about how her daughter’s dance bucket list included dancing at a Vikings Super Bowl. It’s like… Your daughter is eight. Is this real life? A woman complained she couldn’t pull her daughter out of school to dance full time until she was “past her prime.” I don’t need my kid around that. 



*Mocha Latte:* That’s insane. I’m so glad I have boys. 


*Dragonfruit Iced Tea:* Hey if she wanted to play football I’d have a whole new set of worries.

1loqbj0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loqbj0,I've found that hardly anyone visits Wuhan～,"Though not a typical tourist city, Wuhan boasts convenient transportation and a wealth of delicious food. Whether you're traveling south from Beijing, east from Xi'an and Chengdu, or west from Shanghai, you're likely to pass through here. However, it rarely appears in people's travel plans

From my own experience of visiting Wuhan several times, I can say that Wuhan in autumn is truly wonderful. The golden fallen leaves🍂 paired with the setting sun over the Yangtze River is really beautiful (Figure 1)

📍In the Northwest Lake area of Wuhan, there are many small and long-standing shops. For example, the café in Figure 5 has been open for over 20 years. ☕️Coffee enthusiasts gather here every day to chat. I highly recommend it for coffee lovers! The adjacent hamburger shop is also delicious (Figure 4), and the bakery in the city center (Figure 6) always has a long queue. People from other provinces come to try it. Lastly, there's the Baocheng Road Night Market in Wuhan (Figure 7), which is bustling at night with a variety of goods and many street food stalls



By the way, Wuhan's breakfast is very diverse. There are several streets (such as Shanghaiguan Road) full of food. A bowl of hot dry noodles in the morning is really delicious😋 I recommend this hidden gem of a city to everyone. It can be an alternative to Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, or Shanghai. (Let me add that Wuhan's various museums are also well worth a visit)

We share so many similarities like humour and stuff but a big one is music. We both love metal music so much. Her favourite band is ghost mine is Metallica (that’ll make sense later). We’ve sent nudes and stuff to each other and gotten to know each other really well. We’ve both confessed we’ve caught feelings for each other. I honestly trust her with my life and so does she. But only yesterday the 30/6 I bought some tickets to a metal concert which is in the city next to her about 20 min away. The tickets come in a 2 pack so I could on buy the 2 and not one. So I asked her if she’d like to come to the concert with me. We’ve not met at this point either. But she’s on a trip and only comes back the day before the concert and on the night they are celebrating a friend’s birthday. So I thought fair enough it would be a tight schedule to be able to go but still possible. She said she’d love to go but then she come out with “I’m very scared to meet you yet 😅” of course I reassured her it would be okay and that we’d have an amazing time and I’m doing all the heavy lifting going to her. I understand it can be a bit nerve racking but I told her it doesn’t scare me and I’d make sure she’s okay and it’s not awkward. Personally I think it’s an amazing opportunity to break the seal and meet as it’s something we both enjoy and is fun so will remove the awkwardness like a coffee meet up or something. Both our favourite bands are also playing. I just can’t wrap my head around why she wouldn’t as she has been constantly telling me for months she’d love to meet me. It just seems like the perfect chance. Either way I told her I respect her opinion and don’t wanna make her feel forced or pressured too just thought it would be fun.

1loq5jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1loq5jh/sf_sleep_paralysis/,[SF] Sleep Paralysis,"""What was the last dream you had?""

I try not to look into Dr. Klein's eyes. They have a piercing quality I don't enjoy. Gentle but piercing, the worst combination. It makes you feel bad for trying to fight it.

""There was a cave of some sorts. It kept going, long and hot and warm, uncomfortably so. I could still sweat back then, I could still overheat, so I was drenched. I kept walking down it, heading towards my fate.""

She writes in her notepad, nodding her head. Her blonde ringlets bounce as she nods, full of that prom night volume. When she closes her little brown eyes, I wonder what she dreams of. I try to focus and look up at the ceiling as I continue.

""At the end of the cave, he was there. The god of fire. I think he knew what I wanted. I couldn't talk to him but he knew, and he gave it to me. He held me in his embrace, like hugging the sun, and that was the last time I woke up. I miss that feeling."" Breakfast isn't breakfast anymore. It's not energy for the day, I'm not breaking anything. I can eat whenever I want. It's a calculated mixture of vitamins and proteins. I don't get tired anymore, so now instead of needing calories I just keep myself looking okay.

""You miss waking up? More so than dreaming?"" Dr. Klein looks unsurprised despite the polite questions. Her eyebrows are carefully done. Not too thin, not too thick. Despite being a natural blonde she colors them in brown, same color as her eyes. Her makeup is usually light. On bad days, you can tell she overdoes it because her neck and her face are an octave apart in shades. Today she looks good.

I shrug. ""I didn't dream a ton before I got my powers. I slept through most nights peacefully. Waking up is something you do every single morning, and it gives you a start. Makes you feel a break, you know? I'll do it tomorrow doesn't have the same vibe to it when you don't have a conscious reset. It just makes you more aware that you're wasting time.""

She thinks on that for a moment. ""Yes, I recall us discussing how you felt about productivity and the need to be doing more. In the past few months you've gotten better at using thought exercises to put yourself in and out of motion. I think we're in a good place there."" 

She smiles.

I smile back, working hard to look at a point above her forehead, above her soft hair. ""I think so too. I guess something else has been bugging me. You were right, the structure I gave myself helps. But it was nice to have breakfast because I was hungry and needed to wake up. There's something really satisfying about taking care of yourself on a deeper level, you know?""

Dr. Klein shakes her head. ""Gil, I don't mean to interrupt your train of thought, but I think we've discussed that plenty too and I'm not sure it needs to be revisited. We can discuss it more of course, but I don't think that's why you're here, frankly."" She smiles again, and I try not to pay too much attention so it doesn't get weird. ""After all, you're paying me extra to only see you at these odd hours.""

She gestures at the clock on the wall, displaying 4:36 AM, right above the coffee machine I got her a couple of weeks ago. I'm glad she's getting so much use out of it. The smell of tonight's cup lingers in the air. Swiss coffee. She's been making use of that membership I got her too.

If I'm making her go through the trouble, I might as well make it bearable.

""Well, during the day I'm busy, you know? Helping people, complying with government tests, plowing fields sometimes for old man Anas. He keeps trying to set me up with his daughter, Heba? She works at that Starbucks on Fifth."" Rats, I'm rambling. Slow down, slow down. ""Not that I'm interested too much. Can't mix work with that stuff, and I don't really know her that well."" I cough politely. ""Say, did I tell you they're trying to use my DNA to make a vaccine for-""

""ALS, yes."" Dr. Klein chuckles. It's like wind chimes. ""Gil, let's not beat around the bush. You've caught me up on every aspect of your life, really. And I'm happy to know you're doing well, don't misunderstand me. Every doctor loves to see their patients thrive, and especially so in a case as unique as yours.""

She purses her lips. Fuck. I know what this means. ""But meeting me at these hours, the gifts, the things we've talked about...""

I look away. All the time awake you spend, you entertain yourself learning how to do solo activities. I can play symphonies on the piano that would blow her mind. She knows that. I can compose fairly well too, although it's not a god given gift. She's heard my best compositions. I've read every book anyone has ever recommended me and more, because when I'm done reading it's 3 AM and there's no one to tell about it except folks online in Japan or China or any of the countries around the world whose languages I've bothered learning. And she knows that, sometimes during our sessions I help her practice the French she's learning. I'm probably the best Tekken player in the country. I ran a three month long marathon with people dropping in and out to cash in on my fame. ""We ran with Gil,"" they say. They don't even know what Gil is short for and half of the ones that do can't pronounce it.
But Dr. Klein remembers. Dr. Klein asked me how to pronounce it. She's pretty amazing. She even knows a bit of Sumerian. 

Unfortunately, Dr. Klein is also incredibly honest and isn't afraid to tell it to me like it is.
""Gil, you're lonely.""

Like that doesn't make it worse.

""I don't think you're really into me all that much. I care for you, and I charge you the same rates I charge everyone else outside of the odd hours."" She takes a sip of that delicious Swiss coffee. It's cold now, though. ""But I think you're in a place where you're working out a lot of problems well and you're feeling restless solving a more external one.""

I shake my head. ""All of my problems are external now. Having infinite time to fix them, double the time to work on them... I can't just keep throwing time at being alone. I have so many hobbies."" I sigh. ""I know we've talked about how hard dating is for me because eventually they have to sleep and I'm alone again, and I know you told me I tend to get a bit manic about spending time with someone because of that... it's just...""

She shakes her head. ""You can't keep me awake forever. And I can't be at your beck and call just when you're lonely, Gil.""

I roll my eyes. ""I mean, it's kind of your job right?""

Dr. Klein raises her perfect brow at me. ""I'm your therapist, not a prostitute.""

Yikes.

""I'm here to help you deal with the issues of your unique situation. If you start deifying me and using me as a conduit for your desire for companionship, things will get messy Gil.""

""So what do I do? Download Tinder again and get up at midnight to run a marathon while they sleep? I can't really help that I just... sort of like you."" 

Imagine me, basically a god, sounding this cringe and telling my therapist I want to be with her. Except apparently I don't.

""Your needs distort your perception. You only feel that way due to proximity. I'm glad you feel understood, but what you seek shouldn't be with me."" Dr. Klein gets up and hands me a paper. ""This is a list of support groups for insomniacs. I'm not telling you to go out and flirt with every woman in these groups,"" she chuckles, ""But you might find people you can connect with. You have the gift of them always being able to reach you during their time awake. That comes with a caveat of course, of searching for emotional regulation and the responsibility to help them too.""

I sigh and take the paper and sneak a look while she sits back down. ""So this is what I have to look forward to? Being the support and finding friends there?""

""You're pursued creative and intellectual endeavors alone for the most part in your time awake, Gil. Just because you're worried about people sleeping and thinking of you as a workhorse when they wake up doesn't mean they will. Time to get out there, meet some artists and EMTs."" Dr. Klein writes in her pad again. Now she's just mocking me. ""Remember, they can't just share your schedule. Look for the signs of good regulation. You've told me your history in dating is quite short, and that makes it scary, so you latched onto me in a safe space. We need discomfort to grow.""

""I am uncomfortable being alone every night, doc.""

""I would venture you've grown too comfortable in your endeavors because you have endless time to work on them the next night. People aren't so simple. They'll change, adapt, regress. The engines you've learned how to build always stayed the same until you came back to them, but that's not the case here."" She gets up and puts away her now empty cup, sitting at her desk. ""I think we can call it a night for now. I look forward to seeing you in, ideally, a few weeks. Preferably not sooner."" 

Dr. Klein looks at me with her stupid piercing brown eyes. ""And please, Gil, no more gifts.""

I get up and fold the paper up, sticking it into my back pocket. ""Fine, fine. I'll give it a try. Two weeks then?"" She smiles at me, warmly and then looks down stifling a chuckle. Maybe the old Gil charm might still work.

""Let's try for three.""

It moves pretty fast, but the dude in front of me keeps on bending over, showing full-on plumber's crack, as he rifles through his backback over and over. The line moves and he stands up, moves, and then is back to rumaging around while the gaps get longer and longer... usually three people worth.

He has a hat that says something about former military, and looks OK despite looking a little older (late 60s maybe) and a cut on his elbow that he is wiping up. Up and down, up and down. This whole thing repeats itself about three times until we are two people away from the agent and the gap is now at least five people. It is a huge amount of space and time to go, so I skip him.

A few seconds later he is behind me and says pointedly, ""That was rude!""  I simply said, ""You were holding up the line"". 

I stuck my ID in the scanner and moved to the conveyor belt. He wasn't behind me from there, so he probably was one of those people without Precheck who is asked to get in the other line.

He said I was rude, and I did skip. I'm a proponent of keeping it moving at the airport (have your cell phone out of your pocket, stay to your right on the people mover, know what coffee you are ordering, etc.). Maybe a ""You good? I'm gonna squeeze by you"" would have been more appropriate?

It's good, and very very strawberry, but after having it a few times now it's almost too much strawberry. I love a juicy/fruity coferment but the 94C almost tastes artificial after a bit.

Doctors say it’s better—but rarely explain *why* ascorbic acid alone isn't enough. So, let’s clear that up.

# Ascorbic Acid ≠ Whole Vitamin C

Ascorbic acid is the isolated molecule that scientists first identified as curing scurvy. It is essential—but calling ascorbic acid ""Vitamin C"" is like calling caffeine ""coffee."" It's only part of the full picture.

Whole fruits contain a **complex matrix** of cofactors that work alongside ascorbic acid, including:

* **Citric Acid**
* **Bioflavonoids** (like rutin, quercetin, hesperidin)
* **Tyrosinase**, a copper-containing enzyme
* **Polyphenols** and **organic acids**

These cofactors affect how long ascorbic acid lasts in the body, how well it's absorbed, and how effectively it functions once it's inside you.

# Clinical Observations Support This

Doctors often notice that people who take ascorbic acid supplements tend to **burn through it quickly**, especially during stress or illness. In contrast, those who consume **whole fruits**—particularly citrus, acerola, or berries—seem to experience **longer-lasting, more potent effects**.

# History Supports This Too

This isn’t just nutritional folklore. Early scurvy studies, like those from Lind’s era, used **whole foods**, not isolated compounds. If ascorbic acid alone had been the only effective component, those food-based cures would have failed *unless* all the other cofactors had already cleared from the sailors' systems. But they worked—even when given late in the disease.

This demonstrates the **synergy** between ascorbic acid and its accompanying cofactors. The cures were effective not because of ascorbic acid alone, but because of the complete nutrient complex found in food.

# So, What Counts as “Vitamin C”?

Yes—ascorbic acid is *necessary*. But it’s **not sufficient**. True ""Vitamin C"" is a **biological complex** found in nature, not a single lab-isolated molecule.

That’s why whole fruits work. That’s why your body knows the difference.

# What If You Can’t Eat Whole Fruit?

If you have medical conditions that make it difficult to chew or swallow fruit—or for any reason can’t eat whole fruit—then **100% juice** is a decent alternative. It lacks fiber, which is important for **blood sugar regulation**, but fiber isn’t directly involved in vitamin C metabolism.

A few extra notes:

* **Black currant juice** is *extremely high* in complete Vitamin C, but it’s very potent—basically like a medicinal extract. Even when needed, drinking too much can cause **side effects**, so consuming only a very small amount is key.
* However, black currant juice could make an **excellent ingredient in a lozenge** for vitamin C supplementation, thanks to its potency and full spectrum of cofactors, as well as the fact that a lozenge can only contain a very small amount of juice, perfect for vitamin C from **black currant juice**.
* Also, not all fruit equals a good vitamin C source, apples, for example, have a very low amount of Vitamin C, but citrus fruits, and the fruits known to be high in ascorbic acid, these ones are the best regarding Vitamin C content, because remember, Citric Acid is a part of Vitamin C, it's what makes it complete, meaning you get more vitamin C than you would normally assume from fruits high in citric acid, like for example, **passion fruit**.",1,1751335390.0,AlternativeHealth,0,0.67,False

(Repost because I wanted to change a few things)

Name: miko Inaba.   Mi-(beauty) ko-(child) miko-(beautiful child) in-(cause/reason) ba-(banner) inaba-(banner of cause)

Age: 17

Year: 2nd

Grade: grade 1

Height: 5'4

Appearance: Miko is a petite girl with short, black hair. She has a slim build but little to no muscles. Most of her power comes from a high cursed energy output. She wears her uniform properly when she is excorzing curses. Outside of work, she wears casual wear mostly baggy hoodies and jeans.

Personality: Miko is a reserved, soft-spoken, and private person who struggles with social interactions and embarrasses easily. Though she has few friends, she is warm-hearted, emotionally sensitive, and deeply caring. Diligent and responsible, she excels in her studies and enjoys spending her free time reading mystery novels and playing video games. She values solitude and often dedicates time to studying or her personal hobbies. She loves coffee, visiting her favorite cafe rach day before going to jujutsu high. Miko is a very dedicated Sorcerer, one of the best in the modern era other than gojo satoru, kenjaku and ryomen sukuna. Miko was taught how to lie by aoi todo who was her teacher. Miko grew a bit detached without her friends, because the higher ups found her best when they needed a defective Sorcerer or curse user to die. Despite her technique, Miko does not believe in karma.

Base technique: karmic retribution.

Miko calls the base technique ""prarabdha"" which is karma being collected in one moment. This technique is first activated once miko snaps her fingers. This enters miko into a counter state that lasts 1 second. If she is attacked during this period, the attacker has their attack reflected into the same spot for equal damage. Miko is invulnerable during this period. The damage that is reflected is not the damage dealt to miko, but the damage that would have occurred if they hit themselves with their own attack. During this period, she cannot attack anything without the counter. This technique has a 10 second cooldown.

Binding vow: No mercy, No shield

This binding vow removes the seconds of invulnerability, in return for miko doing extra damage when she counters.

Extentions: 

Agami (current actions that cause karma to be collected later): this delays the counter hitting an attacker for 1.2 seconds, allowing miko to attack before the counter hits.

Sanchita (past karma): this redirect the counter to another target. Used best against multiple enemies.

Reversal, good karma: This reversal instead of countering an attack, it increases miko's cursed energy output for 5 seconds. It increases more depending on the strength of the attack.

[Hollow technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/s/r3UCtnE8S3) (hollows are way easier in her world) madhyama pratipad: this technique uses up almost all of her Cursed energy to use. She snaps both fingers, activating the counter state. In this counter state, if she is attacked the attacker will be hit by their attack three times over at extra base strength depending on the power of the attack she was hit by. It grows exponentially with power.

Cursed tools: 

""Moment of clarity"" is a necklace with beads on it that glow red. Once per fight these beads can restore her cooldown

""Karma's echo"" is a dagger with three stars on it. Once somebody is cut by the dagger they become marked. If a marked target attacks miko both will get hit at the same time. The counter is weaker than if miko snapped. Karma's echo has three charges.

# The Golden Goose

The countdown had just reached zero when my father's voice cut through the cheers and champagne toasts like a blade through silk.

""You're a burden! Get out of my house. I've had enough of you leeching off us!""

The party guests - neighbors, family friends, even my own siblings - fell silent in that awful way that happens when someone crosses a line you can't uncross. Confetti still hung in the air from moments before, golden and silver pieces catching the light like tiny accusations. I stood there in my mother's living room, holding the torn handle of my old suitcase, feeling the weight of twenty years of wire transfers and sacrifice collapse into this single, humiliating moment.

After sending them millions for years, working myself into the ground, missing my own life to fund theirs - this is how it ends? With me standing on the sidewalk, holding a suitcase with a broken zipper, on New Year's Eve. The irony wasn't lost on me. New year, new me, I suppose.

But let me back up and tell you how I became the golden goose in the first place.



I was the eldest daughter who got out. You know the type - the one who left for college and never really came back, except for holidays and emergencies. I'd built a solid career in corporate finance, working my way up through international firms, living in cities where nobody knew my family's history or expected me to solve their problems.

For fifteen years, I'd been the family's unofficial bank. It started innocently enough - a wire transfer here, a check there. Mom needed surgery, so I covered the medical bills. Dad's business hit a rough patch, so I quietly paid his debts to keep the creditors away. My younger brother wanted to go to graduate school, so I handled his tuition. My sister needed a wedding, a down payment on a house, a car when hers broke down - I took care of it all.

The requests always came disguised as family updates. ""Hey, just calling to see how you're doing! Oh, by the way..."" became the soundtrack of our relationship. I'd answer my phone during lunch breaks in London or Tokyo, listening to carefully orchestrated sob stories that always ended the same way: with my credit card number being read over international phone lines.

I told myself I was being a good daughter, a responsible sister. I was proud of being the one who could help, the one who'd made it. But the truth was simpler and more painful: I was their golden goose, and they needed me to keep laying eggs.

The sacrifices were quiet ones, the kind nobody sees or celebrates. I lived in cramped studio apartments when I could have afforded luxury, saving every extra dollar for the next family crisis. I worked double shifts and took on consulting projects during vacations. I skipped my own health checkups because every spare moment was spent earning more to send home.

I missed birthdays, holidays, and my own life, always promising myself I'd catch up once everyone was stable. Except they never were. There was always another emergency, another need, another crisis that only my bank account could solve.



When I finally came home for what I thought would be a brief recovery period, I wasn't expecting much. I'd been working in Singapore for three years, and the stress had finally caught up with me. The doctor called it severe burnout, but I knew it was something deeper - a kind of spiritual exhaustion that comes from pouring yourself out for people who never seem satisfied.

I'd hurt my back in a stupid accident at the office, slipping on some spilled coffee and landing wrong. Surgery, physical therapy, months of recovery - it was the kind of injury that forces you to slow down whether you want to or not. For the first time in my adult life, I couldn't work. I couldn't earn. I couldn't send money home.

That's when I learned what I was really worth to them.

The New Year's Eve party was supposed to be a celebration, a fresh start. I'd been home for two weeks, sleeping in my childhood bedroom, trying to heal both my back and my spirit. The house was full of laughter and music, neighbors and family friends toasting the future. I felt hopeful for the first time in months.

That's when I made my mistake. I asked if I could stay for a few more months while I recovered.

The explosion was immediate and public. Dad didn't pull me aside for a private conversation. He didn't wait until the guests left. He wanted an audience for my humiliation.

""You've been a burden long enough!"" he shouted, his face red with something that looked like years of pent-up resentment. ""We took care of you as a kid, now it's your turn to leave. This is my house!""

The silence that followed was deafening. I looked around the room at faces I'd known my entire life - people who'd eaten meals I'd paid for, neighbors who'd admired the renovations my money had funded. They all found sudden interest in their champagne glasses.

But it was my family's reaction that broke something inside me. Mom turned away, suddenly fascinated by the appetizer table. My younger brother actually smirked, like he'd been waiting for this moment for years. My sister kept scrolling through her phone, pretending she wasn't witnessing my destruction.

Nobody said a word in my defense. Not one person.

I picked up my suitcase with its broken handle and walked out into the cold January night. Behind me, I could hear the party slowly resume, voices growing louder as if my absence had lifted some invisible weight from the room.



The bus station at 2 AM on New Year's Day is a special kind of loneliness. It's all harsh fluorescent lights and hard plastic chairs, filled with people who have nowhere else to go. I sat there for three hours waiting for the next bus to anywhere, thinking about all those wire transfer confirmations I'd saved over the years. Each one had felt like a small victory then - proof that I was successful, needed, loved.

Now they felt like receipts for my own stupidity.

The bus ride took six hours, winding through small towns I'd forgotten existed. I watched the sunrise through smudged windows, thinking about how I'd spent fifteen years of sunrises in office buildings, missing this simple beauty because I was too busy earning money for people who saw me as nothing more than a walking ATM.

Grandpa's farm appeared through the morning mist like something out of a painting. I hadn't been there since I was a teenager, but it looked exactly the same - weathered barn, wraparound porch, chickens pecking in the yard. The only thing that had changed was me.

Grandpa answered the door in his old flannel robe, looking me up and down with those sharp blue eyes that never missed anything.

""Finally stopped playing hero, huh?"" he said, taking my broken suitcase without another word.

He cooked me breakfast - real eggs from his chickens, bread he'd baked himself, coffee that tasted like comfort. We didn't talk about what had happened. We didn't need to. Grandpa had always been able to read people like open books, and I suppose my story was written all over my face.

That night, I slept deeper than I had in years. No phone calls asking for money. No emails about family emergencies. No guilt eating at my dreams. Just the sound of wind through old oak trees and the distant lowing of cattle.



Over the next few days, I found myself telling Grandpa everything. Not just about New Year's Eve, but about all of it - the years of sacrifice, the constant requests, the way I'd shaped my entire life around their needs. He listened without judgment, occasionally nodding or making a thoughtful sound, but mostly just letting me pour out fifteen years of stored-up hurt.

On the fourth day, he disappeared into his study for an hour. When he came back, he was carrying a wooden box I'd never seen before.

""Got something to show you,"" he said, setting it down on the kitchen table between us.

Inside were letters. Dozens of them, all addressed to me, all bearing his careful handwriting. The postmarks went back years - some as far back as my college graduation.

""Your father's been collecting these,"" Grandpa said quietly. ""Told me he'd make sure you got them when the time was right.""

My hands shook as I opened the first one. It was dated three months after I'd started my first job abroad, and it changed everything I thought I knew about my family's financial situation.

The letter explained that when my grandmother died, she'd left a substantial inheritance - not to the family as a whole, but specifically to me. Grandpa had been the executor, and he'd tried for years to reach me directly about the trust fund that had been set up in my name. The money was meant to give me freedom, security, a foundation for my own life.

Instead, my father had intercepted every letter, every legal notice, every attempt at contact. While I'd been working myself into the ground to support them, they'd been living off my inheritance. My own money had been funding their lives while I sacrificed mine to send them more.

I read letter after letter, each one revealing another layer of betrayal. Grandpa had tried to reach me through my job, through mutual friends, even through my college alumni association. Dad had blocked it all, telling him I was too busy with my important career to be bothered with ""small family matters.""

The trust account was still there, still in my name, grown substantially over the years through careful investment. I was looking at financial freedom I'd already earned but never knew I had.

""Why didn't you try harder to reach me?"" I asked, though even as the words left my mouth, I knew the answer.

""Because he convinced me you knew,"" Grandpa said simply. ""He made it sound like you'd chosen to help anyway, out of love. I thought you were just that generous. Took me years to figure out the truth.""

I sat at that kitchen table and cried for the first time since New Year's Eve. Not just for the money, though that was part of it. I cried for all the years I'd spent feeling guilty for not doing enough, for all the dreams I'd deferred, for all the ways I'd made myself smaller to make their lives bigger.



Recovery, I learned, is both physical and spiritual work. My back healed slowly, through gentle stretches and long walks around Grandpa's property. But healing my heart - that took longer.

I stayed at the farm through spring, helping with planting season and discovering muscles I'd forgotten I had. There's something profoundly satisfying about working with your hands after years of corporate meetings and spreadsheets. Every morning, I'd wake up to roosters crowing instead of phone calls asking for money.

Using my finance background and newfound capital, I started small. Grandpa had always grown the most incredible tomatoes, but he'd never thought to market them beyond the local farmer's market. Together, we developed a farm-to-table business, partnering with restaurants in nearby cities who were hungry for truly local, organic produce.

I handled the business side - contracts, marketing, distribution - while Grandpa managed the farming. It was the first time in my adult life that I was building something for myself, not sending money to fill someone else's holes.

The day I opened my first business bank account - the first financial account my family had no knowledge of or access to - I felt something I hadn't experienced in years: pure, uncomplicated pride.



Back home, the wheels were starting to come off.

The first text came six weeks after I'd left. It was from my sister, all casual concern: ""Hey, haven't heard from you! Everything okay?""

I didn't respond.

The next week brought a call from my brother: ""Dad's been asking about you. Maybe you should call him?""

Then Mom started texting: ""We're all worried. Can you at least let us know you're safe?""

I watched the messages pile up on my phone like snow accumulating on a window. Each one revealed their growing desperation as they realized the golden goose wasn't coming back to the coop.

By summer, the pretense was dropping away. Dad's business - the one I'd been quietly subsidizing for years - was failing without my regular infusions of cash. Bills were piling up. The house needed repairs they couldn't afford. My brother's lifestyle, funded by my guilt and his entitlement, was unsustainable without his personal ATM.

The messages grew more desperate: ""We're family, right?"" and ""Can you help just this one time?"" and ""Dad says to ask you nicely... please?""

I left them all unread. For the first time in fifteen years, their emergencies weren't my emergencies. Their poor planning wasn't my responsibility. Their financial crisis wasn't my crisis to solve.



They came to the farm on a hot July afternoon, driving up the dusty road in Dad's truck like they were coming to collect a debt. I was in the garden when I heard the engine, and something in my stomach tightened with old, familiar anxiety.

But I was different now. Stronger. The work and the time and the truth had changed me in ways I was still discovering.

Dad got out first, trying to arrange his face into something that might pass for fatherly concern. He'd always been good at that - switching between anger and manipulation depending on what the situation required.

""There's our successful girl,"" he said, spreading his arms like he expected a hug. ""Look at you, playing farmer. This is nice, real nice.""

The rest of them climbed out behind him - Mom looking uncomfortable, my siblings hanging back like they weren't sure this was a good idea. Only Mom had the grace to look ashamed.

""We've been worried sick,"" Dad continued when I didn't move toward him. ""You just disappeared on us. That's not like you.""

I stood there in my dirt-stained jeans and work boots, feeling more like myself than I had in years. ""What do you want?""

The mask slipped just a little. ""Now, that's no way to talk to your father. We came all this way to see you.""

""To ask me for money, you mean.""

""We've all made mistakes,"" he said, switching tactics. ""But you're successful now, and we're family. Maybe you can help us out, for old times' sake?""

When I didn't respond, his voice got harder. ""We raised you. You owe us.""

That's when Grandpa appeared on the porch, not saying anything, just standing there like a silent reminder that I wasn't alone anymore. His presence gave me the courage to say what I'd been practicing for months.

""You raised me to serve you,"" I said quietly. ""That's over now.""

The silence stretched between us like a bridge burning. Dad's face went through several expressions - surprise, anger, desperation - before settling on the cold calculation I remembered from childhood.

""You've changed,"" he said finally. ""This isn't who you are.""

""You're right,"" I said. ""This is who I am. You never knew who I was.""

They left without another word, driving away in the same cloud of dust they'd arrived in. I stood in the garden watching their taillights disappear, feeling something lift off my shoulders that I'd been carrying so long I'd forgotten it was there.



The local paper ran a feature about me in October - something about women entrepreneurs and the revival of family farming. The photographer caught me laughing with Grandpa on the front porch, both of us covered in dirt from the harvest, both of us genuinely happy.

I framed that picture and put it on my desk in the little office I'd set up in Grandpa's study. Every morning when I sat down to work on our growing business, I'd see it and remember what contentment actually feels like.

The requests from my family had stopped by then. They'd finally realized that the golden goose wasn't coming back, wasn't laying any more eggs for them to collect. I heard through mutual friends that Dad had filed for bankruptcy, that my brother had to get a real job, that my sister was learning to live within her means for the first time in her adult life.

I felt something about their struggles, but it wasn't guilt. It wasn't responsibility. It was something closer to sympathy - the kind you feel for strangers whose problems aren't yours to solve.

One evening in late fall, Grandpa and I were sitting on the porch watching the sunset paint the fields gold. The air smelled like woodsmoke and the last of the season's apples, and I felt that deep satisfaction that comes from a day's honest work.

""You know what's funny?"" I said, watching a red-tailed hawk circle overhead.

""What's that?""

""I spent fifteen years thinking I was the problem. That I wasn't doing enough, giving enough, being enough for them.""

Grandpa rocked in his chair, waiting for me to finish the thought.

""Turns out,"" I said, smiling as the hawk caught a thermal and soared higher, ""I was never their burden. They were mine.""

He laughed then, that rich, rolling laugh that had been missing from my life for too many years. It was the sound of approval without conditions, love without price tags, family without strings attached.

For the first time in my adult life, I was home.

Humiliated and heartbroken, she quietly left, determined to rebuild her life. Eithan, confident she’d return, was stunned when she disappeared for a month. Desperate, he called her, only to hear her high school sweetheart’s mocking voice on the line. As Kiara navigates her newfound freedom and reconnects with her past, Eithan’s arrogance begins to crumble. But when old feelings and new temptations collide, will Kiara find the strength to truly move on—or will she fall back into the life she escaped?

# Chapter 1 - The Silent Departure

My husband thought I couldn’t live without him, but after I disappeared for a month, he frantically called me.

After ten years of marriage, he claimed I was past my prime and turned his attention to a younger, more glamorous woman.

His friends placed bets on how long I’d last this time. But I didn’t shed a tear or cause a scene; I simply booked the earliest flight and left. Eithan sneered, “She’ll come crawling back to me within two days.” A month later, I was still nowhere to be found. He finally panicked and desperately dialed my number. My high school sweetheart answered with a chuckle, “Ex-husband, have you lost your mind?”

==============================

In the tenth year with Eithan, I always believed I was special. On our anniversary, I gathered the courage to bring up marriage. Hoping to surprise him, I came home a few minutes early. Unfortunately, I overheard his conversation with friends outside the study.

“You mean Kiara? She’s already over the hill,” one of them laughed.

“Good, I thought you’d changed your taste,” another chimed in.

Eithan replied casually, “Ten years, she’s past her prime. I only kept her around because she’s obedient. Otherwise, I would’ve kicked her out long ago.”

The room erupted in laughter.

“Ten years, Eithan, Kiara gave you the best years of her life.”

“But honestly, Kiara’s still stunning. You used to cherish her. How can you let her go?”

Eithan said indifferently, “So what? I’m bored with her.”

That night, I stormed out of the house, making up some excuse about being swamped with work. Eithan’s tone was cold, completely indifferent to me. But the thought of divorce grew stronger in my mind.

Not long after, Eithan’s scandalous affairs were all over the news again. He was pursuing a college junior, an aspiring actress who had just won Best Supporting Actress.

He always went all out when chasing women. Lavish displays, trending on Instagram, piling up cars, houses, and jewelry like mountains to win her over.

The girl, naive as a blank canvas, had never seen anything like it. Within days, they were together.

Meanwhile, I was genuinely busy with a project at work. This project would determine whether I could become the company’s Vice President.

A friend organized a gathering, inviting a circle of close acquaintances. Having been with Eithan for so long, I didn’t want to embarrass him.

But I didn’t expect Eithan to show up with her. The moment they walked in, the room fell silent.

# Chapter 2 - The End of an Era

Several of my close friends looked at me with concern.

I shrugged, “Why are you all staring at me? I’m not the center of attention today.”

Eithan Wells had his arm around a girl and, as if on purpose, sat down next to me. He took a sip of his coffee and said with a smirk, “Kiara Meyer, let’s clear the air today.”

“Go ahead,” I replied.

“We’ve been together for so many years, and honestly, the spark’s gone. Let’s just call it quits.”

I clenched my fists so tightly that my nails dug into my palms. But I didn’t feel any pain. It was as if my consciousness had floated away, watching this charade unfold from above.

Eithan opened his mouth, seemingly ready to continue. I raised my hand to stop him.

“Fine.”

He stroked the girl’s hair, seemingly impressed by my decisiveness, and said in a patronizing tone, “After today, we can still be friends. If you ever need anything, just let me know. There’s nothing I can’t handle around here.”

I shook my head. “Let’s not.”

“Since we’re nothing to each other now, it’s better not to stay in touch. I wouldn’t want the girl to get the wrong idea.”

Eithan raised an eyebrow in surprise, then nodded. “Sure.”

I let out a light laugh and stood up. “Well, you two enjoy yourselves. I’ll be going now.”

“Let the driver take you home.”

“No need. I’ll grab a cab.”

As I walked out of the room and closed the door behind me, I overheard the whispers inside.

“How long do you think Kiara will last this time?”

“Two days? Definitely not more than 72 hours.”

“But I feel like her reaction was completely different this time.”

Eithan glanced at the slightly ajar door and sneered, “I bet she’ll come crawling back to me by the day after tomorrow.”

“This act has been going on for years. I’m tired of watching it, even if she isn’t.”

I didn’t stay to hear the rest. Gripping my phone tightly, I hurried out.

I returned to the apartment I used to live in. Looking at the familiar layout, I couldn’t help but laugh mockingly.

# Chapter 3 - A New Chapter in P-town

The joy I felt when I first moved in was now matched by the humiliation of moving out.

I didn’t take much with me—just my personal belongings. Everything else stayed behind.

I gently placed the divorce papers on the coffee table.

Before leaving, I took one last look at the apartment. Every brick, every tile, I had chosen myself.

I booked the earliest flight to a distant city, P-town.

I had once imagined coming here for a honeymoon.

Being in a foreign land gave me a sense of freedom I had never experienced before.

That evening, I found myself at a small gathering in a bar, surrounded by strangers.

After a few drinks, the door opened, and a man walked in.

The girls around me immediately perked up.

“He’s really hot!”

“Go ask for his number!”

“You go, I’m too shy.”

Returning from the restroom, I spotted him immediately.

He was even taller than Eithan, dressed in a black coat with a casual suit underneath.

What caught my attention the most were his impossibly long legs.

I squinted, realizing he looked familiar. Then it hit me—he was my high school classmate.

My smile froze, and I quickly looked away.

We had left each other with some unpleasant memories back then.

Lorenzo’s gaze swept across the room and landed on me.

Feeling uncomfortable, I excused myself and stood to leave.

One of the girls grabbed my arm and called out to Lorenzo.

“Hey, handsome! You seem like a good guy. We’re all a bit tipsy. Could you make sure Kiara gets home safely?”

I looked up at Lorenzo in surprise.

After a few seconds, he nodded.

“Sure.”

The girl pulled me back down, whispering in my ear.

“Kiara, you’ve only been with one guy. It’s not fair.”

“Your ex is out there playing the field. Why can’t you?”

“Look at him. With all these girls around, he only has eyes for you. It’s obvious he’s interested.”

“Besides, with a guy like that, you’re not losing out.”

She winked at me, and I shuddered.

==============================

Lorenzo drove me back to my hotel.

When we arrived, I unbuckled my seatbelt and stepped out of the car.

Standing outside, I politely thanked him.

Lorenzo turned to me. “You’re being too formal.”

I turned to head inside but suddenly remembered what the girl had said.

Almost instinctively, I looked back. “Want to come up for a drink?”

In P-town, inviting someone up for a drink was a clear signal.

Lorenzo looked surprised but nodded.

In the elevator, he kissed me.

I was already a bit drunk, and his intensity left me breathless.

“Wait… there’s a camera,” I gasped, my cheeks flushed.

My legs were weak, and I clung to his waist for support.

Lorenzo glanced at the camera, then turned, shielding me as he kissed me again.

When we reached the door, he held me tightly.

“Kiara, do you remember who I am?”

I looked up at him, my fingers playing with his belt as I pulled him closer.

“What’s wrong, my childhood sweetheart? Are you scared now?”

Lorenzo chuckled, his fingers tracing my side.

“Don’t cry later.”

Our first time, Lorenzo didn’t even make it to the bedroom.

The rough wall scraped my back, and I bit his shoulder, choking back tears.

“You’re a beast!”

His rough hands cushioned my back.

Then he bit my collarbone hard. “You’re a temptress.”

# Chapter 4 - The Echoes of Regret and Renewal

Half an hour later, I lay in bed.Tears welled up as I teased him.“Lorenzo, how long has it been since you’ve been with a woman?........

**Found my new obsession and it's giving me ALL the feels 😍**

**""He's The Billionaire In Disguise""**

Listen, I thought I was just picking up a light romance but this book has me INVESTED and I need everyone to experience this emotional rollercoaster with me!

**The premise:** Chrislynn is a hardworking woman who finally bought her own house (through installments because we love a realistic queen), but it's falling apart. Enter Kirst - the most gorgeous ""construction worker"" she's ever seen who keeps helping her fix things. Plot twist? He's actually a billionaire heir going undercover to handle his family's business problems. The DRAMA when she finds out! 💔

**Why I'm completely obsessed:**

* Chrislynn is SO relatable - orphan who worked her way through college and bought her own house
* The way she's trying not to obviously stare at this godlike ""construction worker"" sent me
* Kirst giving up his Cebu business trips to help his dad shows he's not just a pretty face
* 167 chapters of slow-burn perfection with a 4.6 rating
* The setup is giving me major ""when she finds out the truth"" anxiety in the best way
* Mount Maria Makiling as the backdrop is giving me Filipino romance novel vibes that I'm HERE for

**What's killing me softly:**

* Chrislynn working multiple jobs to afford her dream house but it's literally falling apart
* Kirst's mom trying to set him up while he's about to fall for someone ""beneath his class""
* The way he immediately offers to fix her toilet without being asked - GREEN FLAG BEHAVIOR
* That moment when she sees his face and almost drops her coffee cup 💀

**Fair warning:** This is setting up for major class difference angst and potential heartbreak when the truth comes out. But the chemistry is already *chef's kiss*

**Rating: 5/5 stars** for pure romance perfection ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Anyone else reading this? I NEED to know how long he can keep this disguise up and how devastating it's going to be when she finds out. Also drop your best ""secret billionaire falls for regular girl"" recs because I'm clearly in that mood! 🔥

Alright folks, let’s be real for a second. Are you tired of the constant hustle, the endless sharing of your face on social media, and the pressure to stay trendy? I mean, what even is “influencing” anymore? It feels like we’re all just stuck in this whirlwind of trying too hard to get noticed, right? 😅

But here's a killer thought: what if you could build an online presence and generate income without becoming the next TikTok star? Spoiler alert: **Faceless Growth is the answer**—and it’s taking over faster than your morning coffee!

So, let’s break down what we mean by Faceless Growth and why you should hop on this train **before it leaves the station**:

**Why You Should Care:**

- **Less Pressure**: No more worrying about how you look in that next post. Seriously, it’s all about the value you bring to the table, not how flawless your selfies are!
  
- **Freedom of Creativity**: Your content can be centered around your passions without the need to film yourself talking. Think blogs, automated content, or even AI-generated material.

- **Focus on Quality**: Ditch the quantity over quality mindset. With faceless methods, you’re free to create top-notch, valuable content without feeling the need to grind daily.

**Fun Fact**: Did you know that there are already successful YouTube channels that don’t show a face? They thrive on visuals and strong scripts—perfect for anyone who doesn't want to be in the spotlight!

**Ways to Start with Faceless Growth**:

1. **Leverage AI Tools**: There are amazing resources like [this helpful guide](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) that can turbocharge your content creation process. Think about automating those repetitive tasks!

2. **Find Your Niche**: What’s something you love or know a lot about? Maybe it’s tech, DIY crafts, or even something quirky like obscure 90s cartoons! Your niche is your best friend.

3. **Social Media**: Create accounts solely for sharing content (not your face). Use graphics, quotes, or curated content. You’d be surprised how engaging it can be without you standing there, saying “like and subscribe!”

4. **Build a Community**: Engage with others who share your passions. This isn’t just about you; it’s about creating a dialogue without having to put yourself front and center.

5. **Personal Branding Through Content**: Establish your “voice” but remain unseen. People are drawn to ideas and stories, not just faces. Your words can create strong connections!

Now, sure, this isn’t to say that the influencer lifestyle is irrelevant – some folks thrive on it! But if you’re feeling like it’s just not your vibe, there’s a whole world of **faceless growth** waiting for you.

So, what's the hold-up? What’s stopping you from stepping back and discovering new ways to express yourself? Remember, this is your journey—find what works for you and make it yours! Who knows, you might just discover a whole new version of you while letting go of the grind. 🌟

I’m visiting Honolulu from August 11th to 18th to see a friend, and I’d love to get some local insight on how to make the most of my stay.

I’m originally from Berlin, Germany, and while it’s definitely less tropical (and less touristy) than Honolulu, I really value learning about places beyond just the surface-level attractions. I’d love to experience O‘ahu from a more local or grounded perspective - whether it’s cool coffee spots, historical places, hikes, or anything nature-related that you think I shouldn’t miss.

Also, I genuinely want to be a respectful guest while I’m there. Are there any cultural norms, local etiquette, or even small things I should be aware of that people often overlook? I’ve read a bit, but I’d rather ask directly: What can I do - or avoid doing - to be a good visitor to the island and the community?

Thanks so much in advance. Any suggestions, tips, or warnings are appreciated!

1lopikr,https://www.reddit.com/r/phhorrorstories/comments/1lopikr/whispers/,Whispers,"I’ve always preferred solitude. Some men chase the lights of the city, the buzz of crowded streets. Me? I like the sound of my axe biting into old oak, the rustle of wind weaving through the pines. Been living out here in the Appalachian Mountains going on twelve years now. My cabin’s about twenty miles from the nearest town—a crooked place called Mill Creek, where folks talk more to their whiskey than to strangers.

The days out here are good. Honest. I wake before the sun, eat black coffee and dry biscuits, and head into the woods with my axe and a hand cart. I chop what I need, stack the logs by the cabin, and patch whatever the wind and rain have tried to tear down. It’s a simple life, one I chose.

But lately… things don’t feel simple anymore.

It started subtle. One evening, while stacking firewood, I caught a flicker of movement between the trees. Could’ve been a deer. But something about the way it moved—too smooth, too deliberate—itched the back of my skull. I brushed it off. The forest plays tricks when you’re alone too long.

Then came the sounds. Footsteps crunching through the underbrush outside my window at night. A slow, deliberate pacing. Not the skittering of raccoons or the heavy stomp of a bear. These were human footsteps.

I keep a loaded shotgun by the door. Always have. First time I heard the steps, I threw on my boots and stepped out onto the porch. The night was ink-black. The woods, dead quiet.

“Who’s there?” I called out.

Nothing.

Just the wind stirring the pine needles.

I walked the perimeter, lantern in hand. Didn’t see a soul. But as I was heading back inside, I heard it—three slow knocks on the back of the cabin. Wooden. Hollow. Like knuckles on bark.

I spun around. Nothing there. I circled the cabin again. Empty. And when I made it back to the front, there were fresh prints in the mud. Barefoot. They trailed off into the woods.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Over the next few days, it escalated. Sometimes I’d hear tapping on the window after midnight. I’d jerk awake, heart thundering, but when I’d look, there’d be nothing. One morning, I found strange carvings on a tree near my cabin. Shapes I didn’t recognize. Twisted lines that hurt to look at, like they weren’t meant for human eyes.

I stopped working as deep in the woods. Started cutting closer to the cabin, kept my axe sharper than ever.

Then came the voice.

It was dusk. I was sitting on the porch, nursing a tin cup of strong coffee, when I heard it.

“James…”

My name, carried on the wind. A woman’s voice, soft, almost singing.

“James, come here.”

It came from the tree line.

Problem is, I ain’t never told no one my name since I moved out here. Folks in Mill Creek know me as Red, on account of my beard.

I didn’t move. I just gripped my shotgun so tight my knuckles went white.

“James,” the voice called again, sweet and coaxing. “Please help me.”

I stood up, scanning the trees. “Who’s out there?”

Silence.

Then the voice came again, from the other side of the clearing. “James, I’m hurt. Please.”

It was mimicking emotion, but it didn’t sound right. It was too flat. Like it knew the shape of the words but not the weight behind them.

I backed into the cabin, bolted the door, and sat in the dark with the shotgun across my knees.

The knocks came again that night, louder, more insistent. Sometimes on the walls, sometimes on the windows. Once, I swear to God, it knocked from the roof.

I didn’t sleep.

I don’t know how long this went on—days? Weeks? Time’s a slippery thing when fear gnaws at you.

One night, I snapped. I heard the voice again, calling me deeper into the woods.

This time, I followed it.

Lantern in one hand, axe in the other, I walked into the black mouth of the forest. The voice weaved around me, always just ahead.

“James, please hurry.”

I walked until the trees swallowed the sky and the air turned cold.

And then I saw it.

It was crouched near a tree, facing away from me. Long limbs, joints bent wrong. Its skin pale and stretched thin like old leather. It wore a patchwork of animal hides, and clumps of matted hair hung from its head like stringy moss.

Slowly, it turned its head—too far, unnaturally far—and its face…

It was wearing one. A human face. Or what was left of one. Stretched over its own. The lips twisted in a grotesque grin, the eye sockets empty, but something shimmered behind them.

“James,” it crooned, in that awful woman’s voice. “I found you.”

I stumbled back, axe raised. It didn’t chase me. It just laughed—a dry, scraping sound that rattled in my bones.

I ran. I don’t know how I made it back. I barred the door, windows, chimney—anything I could.

I don’t go out after dark now. I keep the fire burning all night, shotgun always within reach.

The mission was technically complete, with the minor exception of a quick trip back to the moon that I was about to take with Jarl, Rosa, Susan, and Lynn under the direct observation of a clearly irritated Auggie. The only nice thing about this trip is we would be in void suits instead of prison coveralls. We were responsible for what Captain Victor and the powers that be back at Terran HQ decided was graffiti, and so we were sentenced to clean things up before the TEV Ursa Minor left the system.

“I find an irritating correlation between bureaucrats and a lack of sense of humor,” Rosa grumbled as we performed final safety checks on our void suits. “Rather than let the majority smile, they demand everybody reduce themselves to satisfy the lowest common denominator who might be offended if you smile in excess of blandly.” 

“I once saw a sign at a store that said, ‘Unattended children will be fed to tigers.’ The owner even decorated the place with tigers, and had a tiger mask to chase children around the store,” Susan chipped in. “A few negative Nellies complained, but most folks enjoyed the humor and even threatened their children with what would happen if they didn’t behave. After all, the sign was posted so the store owner could do it! If threatening kids with tigers didn't bring out the pitchforks, I don't understand why it's such a big deal that we asked Haasha to leave behind a little art, science, and culture.” 

I didn’t know what a tiger was or why it would be funny to feed children to one, but I agreed with the overall sentiment. There’s always that tiny vocal minority of sapients with their tail shoved where the stars won’t shine who ruin the fun for everyone.

Before the discussion could continue, Auggie pointed his finger at the shuttle. 

“Time to go, delinquents!” Auggie called out and hurried us on board. “We’ve got a schedule to keep so we can be back for the party and awards ceremony.”

And with that, we all trudged with slumped shoulders onto the shuttle. We took a few moments to strap in while Auggie headed to the cockpit.

“Tac-1! Rock and roll for the cockpit, elevator music for the delinquents,” Auggie called out in a tone that would crack rocks.

*Understood, First Officer Jacque. Commencing playback.* 

Have you ever heard Under Pressure played slowly and with a flute in place of the vocals? Let’s just say the flight down to the moon most definitely qualified as cruel and unusual punishment.

Auggie chose the racetrack I had stamped into the moon’s surface as the first location to clean up and he beamed the shuttle’s exterior camera feed to us so we could observe my work before landing and obliterating it. 

“The bottom of the boot is a little wider on the turns than the actual course, but overall really quite accurate,” Jarl commented sadly knowing that we would soon be responsible for the destruction of one of his favorite racetrack designs.

Upon landing, Auggie marched us out of the shuttle. This is when we got a clue how this clean-up operation would operate. 

“Alright, folks. I need you all to line up on the starting line pointing that way,” Auggie ordered, and we complied. Jarl and I looked at each other and shrugged. Auggie was lining us up the wrong way, as if we would run the track in reverse. In enough trouble already, neither of us wanted to correct him. We would likely be walking a line of shame, so why not in reverse?

“Let’s see how well you guys can follow orders. I’ll keep it simple and slow so there are no misunderstandings,” he started with his most authoritative tone. “You have all been sentenced to a week each of refresher cleaning while the captain and I discuss your final punishments. Failure to follow instructions here will result in immediate assignment to clean out buildup in the waste reclamation systems. Are we clear?” 

We all looked at each other for a moment, then nodded and mumbled, “Yes, sir.”

“Stay in the lines. First person around the track gets their refresher cleaning days transferred to the loser. So I don’t recommend going slow,” Auggie stated in a tone that would not accept any backtalk. 

“Go,” he then said maintaining his stern tone.

We all stared at each other blankly for a moment, then back at Auggie. He simply pointed at the track and looked at us like we are all idiots. 

Chaos ensued as the full-size adults started jostling to run down the track. Rosa and I used our diminutive sizes to avoid the scuffle and take off down the track.

I knew the racing line and started to head towards it, but surprisingly so did Rosa. We ignored the pileup behind us, and I hoped the early advantage in a clean start would help get me to the finish line first. After all, this would be a test of speed and control, and Susan, Lynn, and Jarl had much longer legs. 

I abandoned my skip in favor of traditional running form; upper arms tightly held into my body and back straight. It's less fun and didn't look as cool yet offers far more control and I needed everything in low-g to win the race. Rosa chose long strides for the longer sections but switched to bunny hops in the tight corners for increased control. The bunny hops cost her speed but also was pretty effective at blocking me from the racing line. As a result, we kept tight together around the track as I never quite got a clear opportunity to pass.

Coming into the final straight Rosa was slightly ahead thanks to her bunny hop cornering, but it seemed to have caught up with her. She made a final bunny hop out of the corner and stopped. I figured she was tired, so I took the inside line and aimed towards the finish.

I could see the toilet wand in someone else’s hand. Susan? Lynn? Jarl? I didn’t care! Every sapient for themselves here, and I would… 

…get stiff armed by Rosa off the track.

As I crashed down to the ground watching Rosa sprint to the finish, I took a long look at Auggie.

Frustrated, I called out, “What the heck!” 

Auggie responded over coms with amusement, “Valid to crash someone in Supa-Dupa Cart, valid here. Rosa takes the win!”

Amusingly enough, Jarl came in last. You’d think with all the racing games he played he would know the racing lines and how to get around them, especially on one of his favorite track designs. The problem is the big man got a little over excited and pushed too hard. Those well-muscled legs turned out to be great for two things. First, lifting heavy things – which wasn’t applicable in this exercise, unless you counted the big man himself. Second, powerfully propelling him off the track in almost every tight corner. All horsepower, no cornering.

This let Lynn and Susan just jog the track and keep their runs clean after the starting tussle. They actually finished by jogging arm in arm with each other so neither of them went off track. Lack of experience in low-g conquered by effective teamwork! And Jarl's inability to appropriately control himself.

Jarl’s fate decided, we then proceeded to stomp around the entire area and hide the evidence that a track ever existed. In the end, the area just looked like a shuttle landing site where a bunch of people had done random stuff.

Site one down, four more to go. We were about to be reminded why everybody loves Auggie. Except when he hasn’t had coffee. Or when you spill his coffee. 

Site two! The mathematical fallacy I had stomped into the moon at Rosa’s request was erased by a series of races. Susan and I each got one of our refresher cleaning days knocked off and picked up by Lynn.

Site three! Shakespeare got trampled under the feet of all six of us playing a human game called flag football. We played two games, and it came out in a 1-1 tie at the end. No cleaning days earned or lost.

Site four! Auggie enlisted the help of Tac-1 for music and instruction using our coms and helmet holodisplays. Einstein’s face learned what it was like to have five spacers learn to line dance in low gravity.

And finally, my public service announcement. As the shuttle approached, Auggie took a much longer and slower approach so my companions could get a good look on their helmet holodisplays. After all, they had no idea this one existed. There was my little box with the arrow pointing it, and the declaration that “Haasha pooped here.” 

Jarl, Lynn, and Susan burst out with stunned expressions that matched their faces.

“What the…”   

“Say what?”  

“For real?” 

Rosa was the only one who remained calm and decided to make the key inquiry. “I desire to know the veracity of this statement.”

Tac-1 betrayed me. 

*I can only confirm that data was collected at this site. The nature of the data collected is subject to privacy regulations.*

While everyone else burst out laughing, I simply crossed my arms and looked away. 

At this site, Auggie had a different plan. We marched in a straight line to the box with me at the center. After all, nobody else wanted to step where I might have pooped. Once there, Auggie had everyone lock arms and baby step around in a circle with me as the pivot point in the center. We then moved out on the straight line to the outermost circle and baby stepped another set of circles around the inner ones he had us create. We repeated this process until all the text and my oversized arrow were obliterated and covered by concentric circles with just a single straight line breaking the pattern.

With my public service announcement deleted and replaced by a series of concentric circles, Auggie had us load back onto the shuttle. We were all a bit confused, but it was Lynn who actually asked. As she was stepping onto the boarding ramp, she looked at Auggie and asked the simple question on everyone’s mind. “Why?”

“I’m fine with leaving a crop circle. Or at least something close to it,” was all he said.",13,1751333994.0,HFY,4,0.94,False

So I'm a product design student and currently working on a coffee table model. The tabletop is milled from 22 mm MDF and measures 110 x 60 cm. It has a continuous 10° bevel along the edges, and each corner has a radius of 150 mm (please refer to the technical drawing; The cutouts aren't relevant for my question right now).

I'd like to veneer the entire thing, including the sides, with the grain running horizontally. The issue is that, due to the bevel, the corner radii are larger at the top than at the bottom (resulting in a slightly conical shape of the tabletop), which makes wrapping a straight strip of veneer around the corner very difficult. The veneer would need to stretch at the top and compress at the bottom...something it probably can't do, I guess.

What's the best way to deal with this? I'm worried the grain won't line up with the straight parts and will look weird at the transitions

After finishing the lengthy procedure, he opened up the pantry and found what looked like enough food to last him a year: MREs, canned beans and meat, bread, peanut butter, jelly, and a variety of other long-lasting foods you’d expect to find in a doomsday shelter.



“All this money and you couldn’t pack me some better food?” Michael asked.



He ate three peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, drank one more jar for good measure, and walked downstairs to go to sleep on the couch.



With all the lights off, he couldn’t even see his hands in front of him. There were no electronics in the house outside of the arcade games, and even as someone who was fine being alone the majority of time, Michael couldn’t help but feel much too cut off from the outside world.



“It’s your first day,” he whispered to himself. “It’s too early to be thinking like this.” But he couldn’t shake the feeling that he might spend eternity here. Something felt wrong about the jars that healed severe injuries instantly. Technology like that should have been widespread use, available in every pharmacy around the country, or hidden by the government, or sold to millionaires at hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop. Not shown for the first time ever in a YouTube challenge—one that he, a random wanna-be-influencer, was starring in.



But… well, maybe this was the biggest YouTube video ever. Maybe the creators of that purple drink were the sponsors, and they needed a real, normal guy to prove that it was real. In that case, it was more likely than ever that he was going to end up a star.



In the morning his spirits were raised, and he decided to give the people some entertainment. 



He went upstairs and took a shower. Then, he went to the game room and grabbed 3 different MREs. He went down to the kitchen, made some coffee, then sat at the table and opened all three meals up.



“Today we’re going to be ranking three MREs,” he held each meal up and read the labels as he continued. “Chilli With Beans, Spaghetti With Marinara Sauce, and Southwest Style Beef and Black Beans.”



He made a big show of tasting each meal, closing his eyes and letting out a loud “Mmm!” after each bite.



At the end, he did a drum roll with two spoons on the kitchen table and announced that Southwest Style Beef and Black Beans was the winner.



He did a quick outro, making sure to shout each one of his socials, and let out a loud “yeehaw!”



Finally, he drank one more big glass of water, grabbed the second key from where he left it on the ping pong table upstairs, and approached door number two.



He took a deep breath as he rested his hand on the knob. He told himself that this was just for dramatic effect–to keep the viewers hooked, but deep down he was scared. He expected that the challenges were only going to get harder and harder. Yes, he had the potion which would make everything okay in the end, but what about in the meantime? He couldn’t bring it into the room, and what if he couldn’t make it out? Would someone come and save him? 



Michael closed his eyes and slapped himself in the head. He opened the door.



It was like the last room—a normal bedroom you’d expect to find in a house much smaller than this one. However, there was no furniture, and the walls were painted in red and yellow stripes. On the wall directly in front of him was a 3D yellow M, so tall that it stretched from the floor to the ceiling. At the very top of the M was a clock set to 15:00. *A Timer?*



Michael looked around, trying to see what the challenge might be. Or if, maybe, the key would just be lying down somewhere and he could go grab it and be done.



He circled the room, then tried to open the door he’d come in from. Of course it was locked, but as he tried to turn the knob there was a sound of some machinery coming to life behind him, then a grating sound that seemed to be coming closer.



It was coming from the M. At first he saw nothing, but then, within one of its golden arches, something was pushing through the wall. It took Michael a few moments to realize that it was a massive chair. Sitting upon it was a clown with red hair.



Its hands were resting on its knees, one with the palm faced upwards, holding a key. Michael approached the clown carefully.



When he was just close enough, he reached out quick as lightning and grabbed the key. 



But as he gripped it, the metal hand of the clown gripped his own. 



Michael screamed, but the harder he tried to pull away the harder the clown seemed to grip. He was scared it was going to break his hand, or tear his arm off completely. He stopped pulling away and moved an inch closer.



A mechanical drawer beneath the throne opened, and the clown reached down with his other hand to pull out a milk carton.



It let go of Michael’s hand, keeping the key, and handed the milk to him. Just as he did so, a horn blared from the ceiling and Michael looked up to see that the timer was counting down. *15:00, 14:59, 14:58.*



*This is a YouTube video,* Michael told himself. *And this is just a mechanical clown. No big deal.* He’d chugged a gallon of milk in less than a minute before. This was nothing.



So Michael gladly accepted the carton. “Gee, thanks for the drink,” he said, raising the milk to his mouth. “I was thirsty!” 



He drank it all in one big gulp and burped loudly. “Impressed?” Michael asked. 



But the clown’s expression hadn’t shifted an inch. Instead, in the same practiced speed as the first time, as if the clown worked in a factory and did this all day, he reached down into the drawer and handed Michael another carton.



“Aw Jesus,” Michael complained. As much as he tried to play it off, the truth was that drinking an entire gallon of milk was not exactly easy. His stomach was already painfully bloated, and he would have much rather thrown up than drink another gallon.



However, he had his dignity to keep. He grabbed the milk with both hands, raised it to his lips, and started chugging.



Almost as soon as he started, he felt the milk bubbling up in his throat, as if his stomach was full and the liquid had no place else to go. Halfway through he was lightheaded, and by the end he was sure the milk was going to start flowing from his eyes and ears.



His stomach was bulging and he burped several times. He swallowed the milk mixed with beans, spaghetti, and sour stomach bile back down several times. He checked the clock to see that he still had 9 minutes remaining.



Then, the clown pulled out another milk carton.



“Jesus man,” Michael said, still panting as he stepped backwards. “No more! I’m freaking done!”



With incredible speed, the clown reached forward and took Michael with both hands, then pulled Michael against itself. He put one hand around him, embracing him against its legs and locking Michael in place so that he was forced to stare upwards into the clown's dark, merciless eyes.



It raised the milk carton and poured it down on Michael’s head. Michael tried to keep his mouth closed as he squirmed, but the milk funneled into his nose, causing Michael to gag and cough.



When the carton was empty the clown rolled Michael down to the floor. He fell stomach first and felt a stabbing from under his belly button. As if he were a balloon being punctured, the milk rose like a powerful fountain from his stomach and flew up to his mouth. He wretched onto the floor, and the vomit splashed up into his eyes and onto his face.



He scooted backwards to get away from the puke, then stood up and continued to throw up so hard that his mouth opened involuntarily wide. He was scared that his jaw was going to break and that his cheeks would tear open.



He vomited and vomited—milk mixed with stomach bile that turned it a yellowish green mixed with chunks of beans and beef. The smell was like someone had marinated a rotting fish in sour milk and then let it bake out in the sun.



Michael had to hold his nose to keep from vomiting again. He looked up at the timer to see that he only had 3 minutes left. He hoped he only had to drink one more carton. He thought that it might be possible. But if he couldn’t well… what happened then? Would the clown kill him? Would he lose the game? To Michael, the two might as well have been one in the same.



The clown was holding out the milk with one hand and a singular finger up with the other. Michael looked the clown in the eyes, held its gaze for a moment, as if the machine might come to its senses, and then, when he decided it wouldn’t, he wiped puke away from his lips and put the carton up to his mouth. *2:30 left*.



*Now or never,* Michael thought.



He chugged as much of the milk as he could, tasting pieces of vomit that had either gotten stuck to his teeth or caked to the sides of his mouth. He drank and drank with his eyes closed until he felt the milk bubbling up. 



He lowered the carton and checked to see that he’d downed only about a fourth of it. *2 minutes left.*



He drank more. Felt as if he were breathing it, as if his lungs were full of it. He took a deep breath, then more milk, then another deep breath, then more milk. He repeated this over and over and still had half a gallon left with 1 minute to go.



He was made of milk. Drinking more was impossible simply due to the fact that he was a cup filled to the brim. Any more would simply overflow—out of his mouth, nose, ears, and eyes. It had to go somewhere, but it couldn’t stay inside of him.



But yet, with 55 seconds to go he decided that he would drink the rest of the milk or die trying. No matter what happened he would keep going. If it started to flow out of his mouth or if he coughed it up, so be it. He would keep pouring, and if the clown decided that what he had wasn’t enough, he’d accept that.



*If I can’t do it,* he thought. *At least everyone will know that I tried. That I failed because it was impossible, not because I gave up.*



He held the carton up with both hands, put the top into his mouth, and tilted it back so that it was falling in at full force.



There’s a trick to chugging things fast without tasting them or having to stop for air. All the professionals use it, a lot of YouTubers too. The trick is to tilt your head all the way back and relax your throat as if you’re simply trying to let air flow through without sucking it in. 



Then, you pour the drink in like you’re pouring water down a drain. You don’t try to swallow or gulp it, you simply let it flow down your throat. 



Michael did this, and as he poured the milk down his throat he thought of all his new fans, the money, and his parents who would soon be proud but proven wrong all the same. He thought about the $50,000 and his new career. He thought about his future—freedom.



He opened his eyes and in the corner of his vision he could only see the far right digit of the clock, ticking down. He wasn’t sure if it was at 28, 18, or 8.



His vision faded in and out, his temples throbbed. He felt puke bubbling up and an urge to stop and breathe, but then the flow of liquid stopped. He squeezed the carton until his hands were touching, and opened his eyes to see the clock go from 0:02 to 0:01, and then it stopped.



The clown opened its hand and Michael took the key, looked it in the eyes, and nodded.



As he turned around toward the bedroom door, the throne pulled back, scraped against the ground, and then was gone.



Michael was sure his stomach was going to explode as he walked toward the door. As the milk sloshed around in his stomach, he imagined himself as a big bucket of puke ready to be tilted over. He struggled hard to breath and wondered if he was drowning. He remembered hearing about a kid who had died from drinking too much water, and wondered what his parents would think if they found out he died from drinking too much milk.



The trek to the refrigerator felt like miles. He sat down on the floor as he pulled out a jar. 



“I really hope this works,” he said, and took a big gulp.



At first the pain was intense. The milk was still bubbling in his throat and the addition of the drink made him feel as if his neck was going to explode, but as he continued to drink, his stomach flattened and the pain slowly released. 



By the time he finished the drink he felt as good as new, though [much less likely to drink milk again anytime soon.](http://connorisaacwriting.com)

Not shown for the first time ever in a YouTube challenge—one that he, a random wanna-be-influencer, was starring in.



But… well, maybe this was the biggest YouTube video ever. Maybe the creators of that purple drink were the sponsors, and they needed a real, normal guy to prove that it was real. In that case, it was more likely than ever that he was going to end up a star.



In the morning his spirits were raised, and he decided to give the people some entertainment. 



He went upstairs and took a shower. Then, he went to the game room and grabbed 3 different MREs. He went down to the kitchen, made some coffee, then sat at the table and opened all three meals up.



“Today we’re going to be ranking three MREs,” he held each meal up and read the labels as he continued. “Chilli With Beans, Spaghetti With Marinara Sauce, and Southwest Style Beef and Black Beans.”



He made a big show of tasting each meal, closing his eyes and letting out a loud “Mmm!” after each bite.



At the end, he did a drum roll with two spoons on the kitchen table and announced that Southwest Style Beef and Black Beans was the winner.



He did a quick outro, making sure to shout each one of his socials, and let out a loud “yeehaw!”



Finally, he drank one more big glass of water, grabbed the second key from where he left it on the ping pong table upstairs, and approached door number two.



He took a deep breath as he rested his hand on the knob. He told himself that this was just for dramatic effect–to keep the viewers hooked, but deep down he was scared. He expected that the challenges were only going to get harder and harder. Yes, he had the potion which would make everything okay in the end, but what about in the meantime? He couldn’t bring it into the room, and what if he couldn’t make it out? Would someone come and save him? 



Michael closed his eyes and slapped himself in the head. He opened the door.



It was like the last room—a normal bedroom you’d expect to find in a house much smaller than this one. However, there was no furniture, and the walls were painted in red and yellow stripes. On the wall directly in front of him was a 3D yellow M, so tall that it stretched from the floor to the ceiling. At the very top of the M was a clock set to 15:00. *A Timer?*



Michael looked around, trying to see what the challenge might be. Or if, maybe, the key would just be lying down somewhere and he could go grab it and be done.



He circled the room, then tried to open the door he’d come in from. Of course it was locked, but as he tried to turn the knob there was a sound of some machinery coming to life behind him, then a grating sound that seemed to be coming closer.



It was coming from the M. At first he saw nothing, but then, within one of its golden arches, something was pushing through the wall. It took Michael a few moments to realize that it was a massive chair. Sitting upon it was a clown with red hair.



Its hands were resting on its knees, one with the palm faced upwards, holding a key. Michael approached the clown carefully.



When he was just close enough, he reached out quick as lightning and grabbed the key. 



But as he gripped it, the metal hand of the clown gripped his own. 



Michael screamed, but the harder he tried to pull away the harder the clown seemed to grip. He was scared it was going to break his hand, or tear his arm off completely. He stopped pulling away and moved an inch closer.



A mechanical drawer beneath the throne opened, and the clown reached down with his other hand to pull out a milk carton.



It let go of Michael’s hand, keeping the key, and handed the milk to him. Just as he did so, a horn blared from the ceiling and Michael looked up to see that the timer was counting down. *15:00, 14:59, 14:58.*



*This is a YouTube video,* Michael told himself. *And this is just a mechanical clown. No big deal.* He’d chugged a gallon of milk in less than a minute before. This was nothing.



So Michael gladly accepted the carton. “Gee, thanks for the drink,” he said, raising the milk to his mouth. “I was thirsty!” 



He drank it all in one big gulp and burped loudly. “Impressed?” Michael asked. 



But the clown’s expression hadn’t shifted an inch. Instead, in the same practiced speed as the first time, as if the clown worked in a factory and did this all day, he reached down into the drawer and handed Michael another carton.



“Aw Jesus,” Michael complained. As much as he tried to play it off, the truth was that drinking an entire gallon of milk was not exactly easy. His stomach was already painfully bloated, and he would have much rather thrown up than drink another gallon.



However, he had his dignity to keep. He grabbed the milk with both hands, raised it to his lips, and started chugging.



Almost as soon as he started, he felt the milk bubbling up in his throat, as if his stomach was full and the liquid had no place else to go. Halfway through he was lightheaded, and by the end he was sure the milk was going to start flowing from his eyes and ears.



His stomach was bulging and he burped several times. He swallowed the milk mixed with beans, spaghetti, and sour stomach bile back down several times. He checked the clock to see that he still had 9 minutes remaining.



Then, the clown pulled out another milk carton.



“Jesus man,” Michael said, still panting as he stepped backwards. “No more! I’m freaking done!”



With incredible speed, the clown reached forward and took Michael with both hands, then pulled Michael against itself. He put one hand around him, embracing him against its legs and locking Michael in place so that he was forced to stare upwards into the clown's dark, merciless eyes.



It raised the milk carton and poured it down on Michael’s head. Michael tried to keep his mouth closed as he squirmed, but the milk funneled into his nose, causing Michael to gag and cough.



When the carton was empty the clown rolled Michael down to the floor. He fell stomach first and felt a stabbing from under his belly button. As if he were a balloon being punctured, the milk rose like a powerful fountain from his stomach and flew up to his mouth. He wretched onto the floor, and the vomit splashed up into his eyes and onto his face.



He scooted backwards to get away from the puke, then stood up and continued to throw up so hard that his mouth opened involuntarily wide. He was scared that his jaw was going to break and that his cheeks would tear open.



He vomited and vomited—milk mixed with stomach bile that turned it a yellowish green mixed with chunks of beans and beef. The smell was like someone had marinated a rotting fish in sour milk and then let it bake out in the sun.



Michael had to hold his nose to keep from vomiting again. He looked up at the timer to see that he only had 3 minutes left. He hoped he only had to drink one more carton. He thought that it might be possible. But if he couldn’t well… what happened then? Would the clown kill him? Would he lose the game? To Michael, the two might as well have been one in the same.



The clown was holding out the milk with one hand and a singular finger up with the other. Michael looked the clown in the eyes, held its gaze for a moment, as if the machine might come to its senses, and then, when he decided it wouldn’t, he wiped puke away from his lips and put the carton up to his mouth. *2:30 left*.



*Now or never,* Michael thought.



He chugged as much of the milk as he could, tasting pieces of vomit that had either gotten stuck to his teeth or caked to the sides of his mouth. He drank and drank with his eyes closed until he felt the milk bubbling up. 



He lowered the carton and checked to see that he’d downed only about a fourth of it. *2 minutes left.*



He drank more. Felt as if he were breathing it, as if his lungs were full of it. He took a deep breath, then more milk, then another deep breath, then more milk. He repeated this over and over and still had half a gallon left with 1 minute to go.



He was made of milk. Drinking more was impossible simply due to the fact that he was a cup filled to the brim. Any more would simply overflow—out of his mouth, nose, ears, and eyes. It had to go somewhere, but it couldn’t stay inside of him.



But yet, with 55 seconds to go he decided that he would drink the rest of the milk or die trying. No matter what happened he would keep going. If it started to flow out of his mouth or if he coughed it up, so be it. He would keep pouring, and if the clown decided that what he had wasn’t enough, he’d accept that.



*If I can’t do it,* he thought. *At least everyone will know that I tried. That I failed because it was impossible, not because I gave up.*



He held the carton up with both hands, put the top into his mouth, and tilted it back so that it was falling in at full force.



There’s a trick to chugging things fast without tasting them or having to stop for air. All the professionals use it, a lot of YouTubers too. The trick is to tilt your head all the way back and relax your throat as if you’re simply trying to let air flow through without sucking it in. 



Then, you pour the drink in like you’re pouring water down a drain. You don’t try to swallow or gulp it, you simply let it flow down your throat. 



Michael did this, and as he poured the milk down his throat he thought of all his new fans, the money, and his parents who would soon be proud but proven wrong all the same. He thought about the $50,000 and his new career. He thought about his future—freedom.



He opened his eyes and in the corner of his vision he could only see the far right digit of the clock, ticking down. He wasn’t sure if it was at 28, 18, or 8.



His vision faded in and out, his temples throbbed. He felt puke bubbling up and an urge to stop and breathe, but then the flow of liquid stopped. He squeezed the carton until his hands were touching, and opened his eyes to see the clock go from 0:02 to 0:01, and then it stopped.



The clown opened its hand and Michael took the key, looked it in the eyes, and nodded.



As he turned around toward the bedroom door, the throne pulled back, scraped against the ground, and then was gone.



Michael was sure his stomach was going to explode as he walked toward the door. As the milk sloshed around in his stomach, he imagined himself as a big bucket of puke ready to be tilted over. He struggled hard to breath and wondered if he was drowning. He remembered hearing about a kid who had died from drinking too much water, and wondered what his parents would think if they found out he died from drinking too much milk.



The trek to the refrigerator felt like miles. He sat down on the floor as he pulled out a jar. 



“I really hope this works,” he said, and took a big gulp.



At first the pain was intense. The milk was still bubbling in his throat and the addition of the drink made him feel as if his neck was going to explode, but as he continued to drink, his stomach flattened and the pain slowly released. 



By the time he finished the drink he felt as good as new, though [much less likely to drink milk again anytime soon.](http://connorisaacwriting.com)

After finishing the lengthy procedure, he opened up the pantry and found what looked like enough food to last him a year: MREs, canned beans and meat, bread, peanut butter, jelly, and a variety of other long-lasting foods you’d expect to find in a doomsday shelter.



“All this money and you couldn’t pack me some better food?” Michael asked.



He ate three peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, drank one more jar for good measure, and walked downstairs to go to sleep on the couch.



With all the lights off, he couldn’t even see his hands in front of him. There were no electronics in the house outside of the arcade games, and even as someone who was fine being alone the majority of time, Michael couldn’t help but feel much too cut off from the outside world.



“It’s your first day,” he whispered to himself. “It’s too early to be thinking like this.” But he couldn’t shake the feeling that he might spend eternity here. Something felt wrong about the jars that healed severe injuries instantly. Technology like that should have been widespread use, available in every pharmacy around the country, or hidden by the government, or sold to millionaires at hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop.

Brand new to pour over coffee, the time it's taking to brew is just crazy. It's so much longer than it should be. My best guess it the grind is going wrong somehow, so I included a picture - I don't know enough about coffee or grinders, does this grind look uneven/bad somehow? I'm using the Baratza Encore, this is setting 19.

On to the full information in case it's anything else.  
Using a [middle-dark roast coffee](https://cortezcoffee.com/products/cortez-primo)

I have tried the settings 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 25 on my encore. Erring coarser lately so the fines don't clog as much but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference.

Using the paper that came with my hario switch, though I have also tried some default coffee filters that I had, no big difference. (This picture was taken in my drip machine with an old filter bc I have given up pourover for today)

I have tried changing temperature ranging from 180 to 215. No luck. I have a Fellow Stagg kettle.

9.5g of coffee to 300ml water (I like weak coffee apparently)  
20ml of water for the bloom phase, wait 30 seconds, second pour up to 160, at first I was aiming to disturb the bed lightly but lately I have been trying to not disturb it at all, then pour rest. I have tried various swirl times, techniques, or not swirling at all.

I even went out and bought a v60 to compare, but the horrible waiting times continued. I am changing one thing at a time. It's been about a week, brewing multiple batches every day. I should clarify - the time does seem affected by some of these changes but not in a meaningful way. My SHORTEST time has been around 8 minutes. The problem is that it's draining slowly, I'm not spending crazy amounts of time pouring.

At the end, the coffee in the paper looks like sludge. Having tried changing most factors, at this point I'm thinking it's just a problem with the grinder? I wonder if it's producing a lot of fines and a very uneven grind. But I can't tell myself, I'm new to this world, and I would totally believe that I'm being an idiot in another department. Please tell me.

If the grind does look poor.. I've heard of others using an encore for their pour over. Is mine defective? Or should I look into another grinder?",2,1751333248.0,pourover,15,0.75,False
