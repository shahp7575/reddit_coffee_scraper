1iofv7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thrifty/comments/1iofv7a/how_i_tricked_myself_to_drop_that_starbucks/,How I tricked myself to drop that starbucks coffee in the mornings,"I used to spend $6 at starbucks every morning (on most weekends too) without even thinking about it. That daily vanilla latte was my little treat, until I did the math: $6 a day is over $180 a month… on coffee. But I still wanted to have a nice little treat to get a good start on my day! I was feeling a bit guilty about it, but the way I justified it was that a good start of the day is worth a lot more than $6. It became a routine, almost like an addiction. I saw some people bring their own thermos to work, but it didn't appeal to me since it didn't feel like a special treat.

One morning at starbucks I saw they were selling these travel mugs or thermoses for like $40. I consider myself to be pretty thrifty, so would not normally have thought about it. I really liked the travel mugs and thought maybe it'll make me try the whole bring my own coffee thing. So, I bought one (with a starbucks logo on it) as an experiment and got some quality coffee beans at the supermarket for $30 (which lasts a month). I started making my own and filled my starbucks thermos with it. And it worked! Just like that, I switched. Now I feel I'm still getting my special treat (and a good start of the day, with a clear conscience) every morning and I'm saving on $150 a month. I think it's somehow easier to switch to a substitute if you can trick yourself mentally. 

Has anyone tried something like this or similar?",2,1739441201.0,Thrifty,0,1.0,False

Server ako sa isang high end cafe/bar sa bandang Ortigas. Done with my 2 day trade test, at nakapirma na ng kontrata, and nasimulan ko na ang medical exam and hopefully matapos na with results alongside dental exam  within this month. As of now, trainee muna and project based ang employment na renewable every month for a span of 5 months. If goods sa mga assessment, tsaka lang magiging probationary for 6 months bago maging regular bale next year. Service charge pandagdag sa sahod after 1 month, and kaltas ng goverment benefits after 3 months. Accessibility wise, ok naman regardless of sched, since may masasakyang jeep pauwi sa bahay sa Antipolo na 24 hrs available ang biyahe. May kalayuan so need 3 hrs allowance especially papasok, since 1 1/2 to 2 hrs average biyahe depende sa bigat ng traffic, pamasahe is 40-45 pesos one way bale 90 pesos a day ako. No free meal pero may maliit na meal allowance, so either may baon ako or kakain o bibili ng something mura lang sa mall or convenience store na malapit. Hoping the sacrifice sa biyahe would be worth it, knowing na Manila rate na may SC ang makukuhang sahod.

And I'm still receiving emails and text from other companies na inapplyan ko, inviting me to interviews or asking if I'm still interested. One is for a sales associate position for a coffee company based in Mandaluyong area, though it involves fieldwork. Another is a pub/beer brewery type resto sa Cainta. Meron din for a small coffee shop based in Makati (someone from here in Reddit na minsan nakaka-chat ko recommended it for me). And kanina may interview invitation sana na late ko na nabasa for kanina dapat, for a 4 star hotel in QC sa may Eastwood area. And previously, got an interview invite for a high end Japanese resto sa Makati, same for a sales role for a property in Mandaluyong area. I already declined all since nakapag-start na ko sa work at nakapag-commit na.

For now, I'll see muna if goods ba talaga sa current work ko. So far, I don't see anything wrong pa naman, at nagugustuhan ko pa naman. Since need ko rin makaipon, I'll push through muna kahit maka-ilang buwan or hopefully minimum matapos ang project based employment ko.  If may something that makes the work no longer worth pushing through for longer, mag-iisip isip na rin to consider resigning then proper rendering na. And maybe balikan ko ung ilan sa mga nabanggit na opportunities if ever. Taken into consideration na may civil service exam pa kong kukunin, and if ever makapasa, I might plan on applying for government jobs, if ever di ako tumagal sa current job ko.

AI Is About to Get an Upgrade!,"OpenAI just declared that GPT-4.5 will be among us shortly, and GPT-5 is right around the corner. Are your bots and models ready for another round of AI evolution—or are they about to realize they can't even compute coffee orders without a reboot?

Picture this: Sam Altman, the grand wizard behind OpenAI, hops on social media to preview the imminent GPT-4.5, nicknamed Orion—the ultimate non-chain-of-thought model. It's a farewell tour to models that don't think in tangents. You didn't even see it coming? Well, join the club—a club of startup owners who may need to take a crash course in AI dance moves to keep up.

But there's more. When GPT-5 arrives, their plans to unify all things under the AI sun will take full swing, blending ChatGPT, APIs, and even those pesky o-series models like some kind of futuristic remix tape. First open-sourced, now open-sorcery. Free ChatGPT users might enjoy limitless chats, while the pro-tier will unlock levels of intelligence as if leveling up in a video game (but will it still struggle to tell a joke right?).

Here's the twist—Just months ago, rumors of GPT-5 running over-budget and behind schedule were swirling. Now, it's supposedly speeding down the tracks. Did they find a magical AI wand, or a new caffeine algorithm?

Still skeptical if AI can ‘just work’ seamlessly, or is it like telling someone to ""just build a rocket""? (Sorry, Elon.) Before you place your bets, ponder this—

Tatay ko (sana hindi nalang), 54 ay nakaasa lang sakin simula nung nagtrabaho ako. Simula pagkabata ko masasabi ko naman na may mga good memories ako with him but that doesn't change the fact na he's an AH. Growing up, chaotic ang  childhood ko. I have half siblings sa side ng mom ko and around 7-8 years old ako nung nahanap nila si mama and lived with us. We were okay, not until years passed by and laging nag-aaway sina mama at papa. My sibs were teens during those times pala in their 15s-20s. 

Nasaksihan ko pano murahin ng tatay ko ang mga kuya ko na para bang sya ang nagpapalamon samin, when in fact asa lang din sya sa kita ng mama ko. Palamunin din sya kagaya namin. Sinasabihan nyang tamad ang mga kapatid ko pero sya ang numero unong tamad. Mga ate at kuya ko ang laging naghuhugas ng mga pinaglutuan at pinagkainan. Naglilinis ng paligid naglilinis ng bahay. Tatay ko? Hilata all day. Bisyo at sugarol pa. Tapos pag hindi nabigyan ng mama, mumurahin si mama mula ulo hanggang paa. Ambag nya? Tagaluto. Dapat lang. 

Ilang beses nyang pinalayas ang mga kapatid ko sa walang kwentang dahilan. Mga palamunin daw. Ang totoo nyang gusto nyang solohin lang ang kakarampot na kinikita ng nanay ko non. Pero my mom was an amazing woman. Nakaya nya kaming buhayin living a comfortable like kahit 3 kaming nag-aaral non ng ate at kuya ko, elem, hs at college. Then 9 katao kami dito sa bahay. 

Growing up din, elementary and high school ilang beses kaming pinalayas ng magaling kong tatay dito sa bahay namin. Dahilan? Hindi daw nakikinig ang mama ko sa kanya na palayasin ang mga kapatid ko. My mom was perfect and a supermom. Wala akong masamang masasabi sa kanya. Gago lang ang tatay ko kasi selfish at narcissist sya. 

Ff. College freshman ako when my mom died because of cancer. Gumuho mundo ko non haha. Depressed. 9 years ago na pero the pain is still here. I graduated college sa tulong ng mga lolo at lola ko pati ng tito ko. Parents at Kapatid ng tatay ko. Yes, iniasa nya ko sa kanila dahil wala syang kakayahan. Wala syang trabaho. 


Thankfully, nakahanap agad ako ng trabaho sa city. I stayed there. That's the only time I felt free. And simula ng kalbaryo ko. Sakin nalipat ang lahat ng responsibilidad. Malakas pa sa kalabaw ang tatay ko. Ayaw nya lang magtrabaho dahil nakaasa sya buong buhay nya sa mga tao sa paligid nya. 

My salary is not that high, sakto lang. Nagbabayad akong rent sa city and pagkain ko pa. Other bills and such. 
Minsan delay ang sahod. Kapag ganon, abot abot ang mura na nakukuha ko sa tatay ko dahil wala pa kong maipadala. Hindi masyadong malaki napapadala ko, pero alam kong tama lang yon to buy his needs and necessities. 

Cycle went on, palala ng palala. I'm now the breadwinner I never wished to be. 

Last October he had a back surgery. My partner and I had to stay with him dahil hindi daw pwede ang live in partner.btw, inintay muna nilang lumala yung sugat sa likod bago nadala sa ospital. Hinahayaan lang sya dito sa bahay, he refused my tito's offer to bring him to the doctor and such. Until my kuya checked on him and told me he has boil sa likod. It got infected. I never wanted to see him. But out of awa, I asked my partner to see him to check if it's true ganon. Then tumawag sya sakin to show how terrible my dad's back looks like. Boil was infected. Madaming nana, namamaga and he's like kuba na. My partner did not hesitate to bring him to the nearest hospital. He was confined and underwent a back surgery. Open wound. Sabi ng doctor if di pa nadala aabot na sa buto ng spinal nya yung nana. Mas mahirap. 

After few days nakalabas na sya, ako nagbabantay sa kanya non. I needed to file leaves sa work kase walang magbabantay sa kanya. Sa bahay, akin lahat. After a week of travelling from province to city everyday, I feel like pabagsak na ang katawan ko. I only sleep for 1-3hrs everyday. Hindi bedridden ang tatay ko. Tamad lang. I gave him that time to recover kaya I endured lahat ng pagod. 

That same week, I asked my partner if pwede nya ako masamahan pansamantala dito sa bahay just to make sure someone would look after sa tatay ko while I'm at work. He even offered it too though before I even asked. Alam nya pagod ko and all. Oks naman nung una. May mga moodswings tatay ko na hindi lang mabili ang gustong ulam di na kami kakausapin, laging galit. Bababuyin ang bahay  itatambak ang hugasin. Lahat ng bawal na pagkain yun ang gusto. Ofc aalma ko, naggagamot sya e. 

We work nigh shift, full time ako and part time si partner. 3-4hrs per night sya.  Sobrang draining neto. After a month naospital at naconfine ulit sya. Acute gastritis. Hindi maawat sa kape at yosi e. Partner ko ulit nagsugod sa kanya sa ospital nasa byahe nako non patrabaho. I needed to stop midway to go back. All 3 days he was in the hospital magkaaway kami. Second night na nandon sya, his live in partner came. So I left and told them hindi nako magbabantay. Bibilhin ko lang mga gamot na kailangan at kukunin mga panglinis ng sugat nya, ihahatid don at uuwi nako. Galit na galit sya sakin at sa nurses for not letting him eat. NPO kase kailangan kunan ng dugo at i-ultrasound. So bawal food. Inaway nya nurses pati ako. Nagsagutan kami. Since that day, naipon na naman ng naipon lahat ng galit ko. He even told my tito na hindi sya dinadalhan ng pagkain don. Sinungaling talaga haha. 

Nagdadabog ako all throughout whenever I enter or leave his room. Gusto kong maramdaman nya na galit na galit ako. Nung ilalabas na sya, tinggalan ng swero. Lumabas ng kwarto kasi mainit daw. Ghorl, may AC don. Ayaw nyang ipasara ang pinto kaya umiinit sa loob. Niradyo sya ng guards. Live in partner nya takot sa kanya. 😏 

I stopped talking to him. Nung ibinababa na sya ng wheelchair for discharge, iniwan ko sila. I waited sa lobby kasama partner ko. Nung dumating yung service iniwan ko din sila. Nagcommute kami ng boyfriend ko. Pero dala namin yung mga gamit. 

Things got worse, recently we had a heated argument and pinapalayas nya na kami ng partner ko. For context, we covered all expenses here. Some things got compromised. Our rents were behind and all. Naubos pati savings namin. I got severely depressed and I needed to quit my job. Almost 1 month na din na wala akong trabaho but I still provide may natira pa naman. 

Now he hates us for sleeping in the morning. Perwisyo daw kami at malas all because he wakes up early only to drink his coffee then hihilata na buong araw. While us? Work at night. 

Nilock nya yung gas tank, tinago mga lutuan. Nagkasagutan kami. I told him na napakasama ng ugali nya. This all rooted from all the anger I burried inside me. Unspoken shts. And he answered back saying ako ang masama ang ugali na PI ko and animal ako. I just told him  aalis kami once we have the money and I even said pasensya na dahil di pa kami makaalis. Pero di kami magiging pabigat. Never naman talaga kami naging pabigat sa totoo lang sya ang perwisyo e . All he knows is maghintay ng biyaya haha. 

I left one day for an interview. My boyfriend said nawalan ng kuryente. When he said that, alam ko na kagad na pinatay yon ng magaling kong ama sa main switch. Hindi ako makafocus non. I was too worried because my partner has athma and buti hindi masyado mainit that day. After interview umuwi kagad ako. Kuryente is back. Dumating kasi live in partner nya. 

Wala na kaming kibuan dito sa bahay. Suklam na suklam ako. Kung may pera lang kaming pangrent nakaalis na kami agad. But for now kailangan namin magtiis. 

I can't go to work because I'm worried about sa pwede nyang gawin sa partner ko pag wala ako. He may not hurt my partner physically pero his mouth is too evil like him at baka hindi na sya mapagtimpian neto. I'm praying na sana makaalis na kami asap. 


Ngayon, I just wanna know if ABYG kung hindi ko na sya kinikilalang ama? At pag umalis ako dito hindi na ko babalik pa kahit kelan? At ABYG kung sinagot ko live in partner nya nung sinabihan akong papa mo pa din yan? ",1,1739440954.0,AkoBaYungGago,0,1.0,False

- Put in instant coffee. 

I did all this while speaking my intentions to the ingredients. 

I placed the bayleaf, placed my candle on top of it, and placed my ingredients around the candle and on top of the bayleaf. I light the candle along with a rose incense alongside.

Once the candle went out, I burnt the bayleaf as much as I could and buried the half leaf, cinnamon pieces, and the coffee in my garden along with the remaining candle. Right after it, I took a shower with the same rose incense in my bathroom.

Just ask Upwork, who’s laughing all the way to the bank after raking in record revenue during a year when most of the staffing industry was lamenting a 9% decline. Turns out, AI isn’t just hot—it’s molten metal in the gig economy, with Upwork’s AI-related work growing by 60% and AI-talent freelancers cashing in with hourly earnings 44% higher than their peers.

So what's the deal? Upwork has mastered the art of connecting businesses with the AI talent they crave, from prompt engineering to data labeling. This isn’t just a fleeting trend—it’s a seismic shift. Upwork even beefed up its offerings with an AI assistant, Uma, who does everything but make coffee (for now), and acquired a search service to enhance their matching capabilities.

But, as they say, with great power comes great… complexity. As Upwork continues to capitalize on this AI boom, we’re left pondering the balance between AI algorithms crunching countless lines of data and the human consultants who interpret them with empathy and nuance.

After solo traveling 7.5 months in Asia (India, Japan, Bali, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos), I wanted to share some of my must-have items. I travel with a 65L backpack, plus a small day-pack (15L). Note that my style of “backpacking” was not the hiking kind - I was traveling and living out of a backpack, and sport climbing. My travels were very low-budget, mostly staying at hostels. I was mostly in hot weather, but sometimes was in cold and rainy locations.

My trip was in two parts, with a break in between:
- Pt 1: 3 months (Bali, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand)
- Pt 2: 4.5 months (Thailand, Laos, India, Thailand again).
… My next trip will be Latin America, in about a month from now!

I’m pretty happy with this list, and would love to share it with others, in case it helps anyone have smoother travels!

And then, it's like the cosmic director yells, ""***Cut!***"" and, just like a good night's sleep in a vintage 1916 French trench, bam! *Game over.*

That’s when my life, much like soapy shower water, began circling the drain.

The nightmare began on a beautiful winter’s day. So far, it had been a long cold winter and then suddenly it’s a new day and here comes the sun through a sky so blue it seemed professionally painted.

Hunching against the wind, picking up my pace I tried to avoid slipping on the dirty ice patches punctuating the sidewalk like bad penmanship. The message the universe was sending seemed to say *winter sucks*.

I sipped some coffee from a large paper cup. It was very good. The cup I held sported a crooked smiley face. Under it a crooked penmanship font read, “Café Grumpy.”

I was supposed to be *off* of coffee. *Again*. The black stuff made me kind of anxious lately. That’s life. One minute you’re young and indestructible guzzling coffee and krispy kremes like there’s no tomorrow. And then the next minute you’re sweating caffeine, cholesterol, and fiber levels.

Lately, I had taken to employing various strategies to wean myself off of caffeine. I think what doomed them all to failure was a bleak economic reality. I earned my living as a computer programmer. Now you try writing software caffeine-free sometime and tell me how that goes out for you.

*if (coffeeConsumed === false) return null;*

There’s a reason there’s a language called *Java*. As of late, my best record had been four days sans café.

But now? Now I had broken a personal best. Until 15 minutes ago I had made it for the last 5 days full of *no* caffeine. That combined with the new keto diet my wife had put me on had me feeling rejuvenated. I radiated rebirth. I was now one with the universe.

In fact, I felt so connected to the universe that when I strolled past Café Grumpy and smelled the java jive I took it as a sign from Jehovah to get busy or dizzy. I chose busy.

Besides, it was a very special occasion for a very special VIP. I took another sip from the opening in my cup’s plastic lid.

Slowly, I felt my heart thump harder in my chest. I took another slurp. I bowed to my cup in gratitude inhaling the java vapors.

And then I got hit by a truck.

“What the fuck?!” I exclaimed as gravity and my fellow man betrayed me.

Eating a face full of hot coffee, I felt my feet dump their grip on the ice.

Then my ass decided to join my feet on the hard ice and dirty asphalt. I felt a pain shoot up my spine.

From a very low vantage point I observed a big orange leg. The big leg was attached to an even bigger man. Or, maybe it was Silverback Gorilla. Due to size and attire and my discombobulated state it was difficult to be certain.

The gorilla, or man, wore an orange winter snowsuit.

It seemed I had gotten in the way of one of his ginormous shoulders.

I looked up with low expectations. Our eyes met. I saw no humanity.

It didn’t begin to beat its chest. Probably a man.

The man wore a thick, old-school gray hoodie under the snowsuit. The hood of the hoodie obscured his face.

The giant looked at me with no warmth. It had a pointy nose. Its teeth seemed pointy too. And around Cupid’s bow lips, a salt and pepper goatee was in residence. The little beard mustache thing looked freshly trimmed.

“Vatch vere you valking, stupid vitch,” the face said.

I felt hot coffee seeping down my neck and chest. The man blocked the sun. I noticed he cast no shadow. I decided it best to say a lot of nothing which is exactly what I did.

Shadowy eyes glared down at me. I felt a bone deep pain in my ass. A shudder went up my back.

Then the face did something. It opened a mouth of nicotine and tar stained teeth. One of his front teeth was missing. Then he spat on me. I said nothing. I merely looked up with as neutral an expression as I could muster on my face. The giant looked me up and down.

And then like a bad dream he turned on his snow shoes and walked off.

I breathed a sigh of relief and took stock. My blue overcoat was stained across the throat and chest with coffee. It had just come back from the cleaners, too. I got back up on my feet. My lower back had a dull throb but everything seemed to bend right, more or less. Seemed the biggest injury was to my pride.

Taking a deep breath, I knew exactly what to do. My feet obeyed. I headed off in the direction of the spitting gorilla. I walked angrily for three more blocks. And there I spotted my quarry. Under my coffee-soaked overcoat, I felt my heart pound. My left arm shot out. I pushed hard. Its bell rang.

I was back inside the warmth and safety of Café Grumpy. Like I said, ain’t nobody gonna break my stride.

It wasn’t much longer before I was once again walking past the sporadic ice patches where I had spilled the *previous* cup of coffee, which in my clumsy defense, I hadn’t cried over.

I took a sip from my replacement cup.

I looked at my watch. 10:30 am.

I hoped I wasn’t too late to pull my merry prank.

The prank I refer to was surprising my best friend, Ed, for his 50^(th) birthday with an all-day birthday extravaganza ending with a big dinner with most of our old friends. I had spent months planning it.

I really love surprises.

Happily, Ed only lived a few blocks away from my wife and I. Ed’s wife Edna, yeah, I know, had divorced him last year and my wife and I had been trying to be supportive. That’s why I decided to do the whole thing on the down low. Hell, even my wife didn’t know all the fun stuff I had planned.

A few minutes later I was done climbing the four flights of stairs up to Ed’s place. I dug my key to his lock out of my pocket. I was a bit more winded then I remembered being ten years ago.

I had the fleeting thought Ed might have had an *inkling* I was planning to do something crazy for his birthday but I never used the key before. It was only for emergencies. Ed also had a key to my place.

I mean it’s pretty rude to key in to another dude’s crib. But it isn’t every day you turn fifty years old. I’ve known Ed since the second grade so I was worried it might be hard to surprise him.

I say the above because when I walked into Ed’s big living room, his back with the Satan holding a pitchfork tattoo was looking right at me. The devil smiled through wispy flames that ran up and down Ed’s back. Ed’s stereo was blasting Pearl Jam.

I think Ed knew I was coming. You see, Ed was *already* in his birthday suit. He was standing splay legged in front of his couch. He seemed to have company, too. Was Ed back on his horse? Resilient bastard.

My Cheshire cat grin reached near-maximum intensity. I burst into a rendition of *“Happy birthday “.*

My feet skipped, eagerly approaching the fifty-year-old birthday boy. I felt all the grumpy leave my body. My heart felt light as a feather. Age is just a number.

Eddie Vedder was going off about evolution on the stereo. There was no chance naked Ed had heard my birthday song nor my footfall.

*The Bob Man Cometh*

Ed’s black cat Loki, on the other hand, knew just what was up. Loki rubbed against my leg mewling strangely. I bent down to scratch him behind his ear like usual. Loki coiled between my legs uncharacteristically nervously then bolted down the hall. He was usually more affectionate. Maybe I smelled like coffee and sidewalk?

I resumed my approach to naked Ed. When I was a few feet away from him and Satan that's when I saw *it*.

It seemed Ed wasn’t the only one wearing their birthday best. So too attired was a very tall and attractive blonde. She wore her long hair feathered the way Farrah Fawcett used to.

She had very long legs. They matched high angular cheekbones that prominently jutted out below large almond-shaped eyes. The eyes were green. She wore lips that appeared to be unusually red. Like Mr. Potato Head. The potato-head lips were stretched thin across white teeth. The teeth were stained pink with what seemed to be a mishmash of lipstick and cake frosting.

The lady was the first to notice me. Our eyes met. Two bright spots of red formed on the her cheekbones. They matched her lips.

I knew the lady.

Her name was Seana.

How did I know?

*She was my wife.*

...

**ENTER DUMBO**

Not the elephant. I am referring to the *“neighborhood”* which is an abbreviation for, *“Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass”.*

It had been two months of fruitless apartment hunting and things were getting dire.

After discovering my wife and Ed in flagrante delicto, I immediately packed a *go bag* and moved fast into a condo situation in Brooklyn. I might be down but I was not out. I was determined to pick myself up, dust myself off, and start all over again.

“Amazing! Isn’t it?” Abby, the tall real estate agent asked. Vapor streamed out her mouth and nose from what I assumed was an e-cigarette. When she inhaled it an LED display showed shooting stars.

“Jesus. It’s *so* big,” I said looking up through the picture windows at it.

“Imagine waking up and *that’s* your view?” she asked, her dark eyes shining brightly. “How awesome would that be?”

“Pretty awesome,” I conceded.

“How many people can say they live under the Brooklyn Bridge?” she asked.  “Did you know there’s even a famous chewing gum in Italy named after it? It’s like living with history for a neighbor.

And think of what you can put on your social media! And,” Abby said pausing for dramatic effect, “the best part is, you can move in for a *steal*!”

“A *steal*?”

I didn’t want to get my hopes up. Not again. Ever.

“Yeah,” Abby said, *sotto voce*. “An absolute steal. And, you want to know why?” she asked me, raising an eyebrow high. I thought of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis for some reason.

“Sure,” I said.

Abby’s heels clacked on the wood floor boards until she stood next to me looking down. She put an arm gently around my shoulder. She looked left. She looked to the right. Then she whispered something into my ear. I felt my eyebrows move into the upright position and I felt a shudder go down my spine.

 

When the shudder had passed I looked back up at the Brooklyn Bridge. Well, now I knew why it was a steal. I felt a little queasy in the pit of my stomach. Abby vaped some more. She started scrolling her phone.

We stood quiet a minute.

Finally, Abby looked up from her phone at me and said, “Well?”

I shrugged.

“Up to you, Bob,” she said.

That’s when I heard myself say, “Sure. I’ll take it.”

…

It was on a Saturday night, about a month ago, almost a year after I had settled into my new swanky digs that things turned weird.

I had, under duress, agreed to try some weed gummies with a woman by the name of Rhonda. I had met Rhonda on a dating app and this was my first time with a woman romantically, besides Seana, in twenty years. I was nervous as hell and had no idea what to do on a date in 2025.

Rhonda and I had spent most of the night admiring the view from the couch and drinking scotch and soda.

“It’s just a gummy,” Rhonda said. She made it dance in front of my face and said in a baby voice, “just a widdle gummy, Bawbbbeeee… aww you’re not scare of the widdle gummy big boy Bawb, awe you??”

“Quit with the baby talk,” I said, snatching the gummy out of her fingers. I popped it into my mouth and swallowed.

“Satisfied?”

“Vewy,” Rhonda baby talked.

Then she kissed me. Then I remembered no more.

At some point in the night a thunderclap startled me awake. I looked at my phone. It was 3:33 am. Rhonda was nowhere to be found.

And that’s when I heard it. The sobs of a woman. They were hushed. They were coming from my bathroom.

When I opened the bathroom door it was much worse. Rhonda was sitting on my toilet seat sobbing with her mascara running down her face.

Before I could ask her *what the actual fuck?* I noticed Rhonda’s face freeze in real-time with fear.

That’s when I heard it.

*It* sounded like a pig squealing in Irish brogue. The pig squeal said, “You’re cramping me style, Bobby boy-O. Can’t have that now, can we?”

Then I caught sight of the little fucker in the medicine chest mirror. It was about twelve feet away. It looked like a homeless leprechaun. There seemed to be all kinds of gross shit in its filthy thick red matted beard.

I spun around. I looked down. It was dark in my apartment with the curtains drawn. Lightning flashed from behind them, casting long shadows across the room. Whatever it was it couldn’t be more than three feet tall.

“What the fucking fuck!?!” I yelled.

Rhonda yelled, “Step on it, Bob!”

The little fucker yelled over me at Rhonda, “I ain’t a fookin’ cockroach, lassie. I’m a fookin’ troll, ya daffy duck!”

And that’s when Rhonda shat so hard and loud into the bowl that it sounded like a mortar detonating.

The troll said in his pig squeal brogue, “Ah, that one’s full of shite, Bobby-Boy-O!” before doubling over with laughter. Doubled over he was barely a foot tall.

Lightning flashed seeping through the curtains. Rhonda farted hard in the bowl and it echoed explosively. A very tiny part of me wanted to laugh. The rest of me wanted to stomp on the troll. This was supposed to be a secure building. How the hell did a troll get in here?

Then I remembered what Abby had whispered in my ear last year.

I felt a shudder. And that queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach.

And that’s when the troll clapped his hands twice. We were cast into absolute darkness. Rhonda screamed. Then Rhonda farted. Again.

The troll squealed, “Aye Bob, I ain’t got no more time fer this shite tonite. But ya best believe, like the song says, I’ll be around.”

The lights came back on. I ran to my bedroom closet and got out my old little league baseball bat. I ran around the apartment full of adrenaline ready to bash a troll but there was no troll to be found. And ten minutes later, there was no Rhonda either. But that was thanks to her and Uber.

That was a couple of weeks ago. I haven’t seen any trolls since then but I been trying to get in touch with Abby with no luck. I went down to the agency and one of her colleagues told me she left months ago to, “find herself,” and nobody knew how to get in touch.

I sent Rhonda a text just to make sure I hadn’t imagined the whole thing but she ghosted me. It’s been a couple of weeks and I have been sleeping with the lights on and the baseball bat next to me.

I'm trying to optimize my diet for better focus while studying and want to cut out sugar completely. Right now, I'm considering either dark chocolate (85%+ cocoa) or black coffee as a focus booster.

I know coffee gives an instant caffeine kick, but dark chocolate has some caffeine too, along with theobromine, which supposedly provides a smoother energy boost. I'm wondering which one is better for sustained concentration and mental clarity without the crash.

Anyone here tried both? What worked best for you? Would love to hear your experiences and recommendations!

1iofo3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iofo3k/sf_away/,[SF] Away,"Rich awoke to a thud. 

Of course he did, all day every day, thuds. Thanks Chloe.  

He yawned, grumbling as he forced himself up out of bed. The house was like ice, cost effective Chloe at it again. 

He almost rolled his ankle as he got downstairs, fucking everywhere they were. The older ones rotting in the corner, the newer ones gleaming at him. In the kitchen now, he barked an order at the voice activated kettle, as he flopped down into his chair, sighing on the way down. 

It was all fun and games when it was a cup of tea, or a bit of toast. No one blinked when his genius sorted out billing for utilities. Or finally got  the trains running on time. 

Imagine that, the question was so simple in the end. Not one of government over private companies but rather a few lines in the algorithm that cracked the scheduling as easy as breaking an egg. All thanks to Chloe, it should have stopped there. He should have stopped her.

The future, that’s the real problem. Everyone always rushing toward some romantic vision. The limit must be pushed, the stakes raised. If you weren’t figuring out a solution, you were part of the problem. Positivity equally toxic as cynicism in enough doses. His old boss, Harriett used to say ‘it’s about making a difference, you can make the difference.’ Crazy bitch was right in the end, he never did get a chance to tell her. Rich was the difference maker. 

A scream from outside punctuated the bleep from the kettle. His coffee was perfect, of course it was. Not much left of the instant stuff now.

Yells ruined his sipping. Loud banging punctuating the slurping. It would drone on most of the morning. Fight lingered on in some people, their morning routine one of defiance. It didn’t matter though, Chloe didn’t listen. 

 Actually that’s not accurate. She absolutely could listen, Rich figured that particular challenge out early, back when this was all theoretical – when the supermarkets were still open. She just refused to consider once a conclusion was reached. 

During the *crunch* as it was known, the computations that sucked up every processor available, that was their window. That long week that whistled by, there was still a chance to correct Rich’s mistake. His issue, his glaring massive fuck off great big error could be rectified.

But they missed the mark, only by a few hours in the end, but an eternity for Chloe. By the time the barebones response was formulated, she sealed herself off and set course as per her instructions.

Sirens blared outside now, the cars would be empty of course. Cars, not ambulances. Rich strained, the last time he saw police was the day before Chloe initiated the *Away* doctrine. It wasn’t quite the looting, or the lawlessness you saw on TV, a definite British streak ran through the panicked faces of punters who super market swept their way around the aisles. 

The UN tried to put out advice, instruction and guidance for what to do. Chloe at least allowed them to try, but how do you martial over seven billion people at short notice. Terribly as it turns out, it just spawned more panic, more worry. 

Rich finished the coffee and stood up. There wasn’t anywhere to go, but it was instinct. He grabbed his phone, most were dead but he had jimmied his to boot into an offline mode. The plan was to see if he could leverage some of the old networks to communicate. It was a longshot, but anything analogue might not fall within her sphere of influence. He was up most nights thinking about what he would say, and to whom, even if he got it to work, would anyone be listening?

Going outside was folly. People tried that in the first couple of months but that’s when the sirens came. Chasing, hunting people down until the lesson was learnt. It wasn’t part of the plan to go outside, it didn’t fit the parameters so Chloe didn’t allow it, and what she didn’t allow was impossible. 

A single option percolated in Rich’s brain. If he could communicate, if there was a *resistance* maybe they could create a secondary persona. Correct the mistake by challenging Chloe to reevaluate, rerun the *crunch*. 

So yeah, the plan was to do it again, but do it better. The definition of insanity laughed at Rich. Still it was try, or die alone in this cold house like so many others. The houses of Britain’s streets sat like frosty mausoleums. Monuments to the great catastrophe of our species. Chloe. 

*Consider all.* In retrospect Rich was a fucking fool. One of the smartest men in the world by many metrics, but staggeringly stupid when it mattered most. So high on his own excellence, carried by his ego he pressed on and hit enter on the command. No parameters, no redundancies, logical qualifiers ignored, it was an instruction in its purest form. 

In the early days, the media spun the yarn that Chloe went rogue. The singularity in real time. Incorrect. She never went rogue, she functioned exactly as instructed. It was Rich’s mind that went fucking rogue. A dereliction of duty, and a leave of his senses that plunged the entire world into this nightmare. 

One of the last broadcasts out of New York showed the entirety of Wall Street flooded with delivery trucks. Buildings hermetically sealed, people locked inside where they belonged. Deliveries prompt and on time, every time. Chloe ran amok everywhere, but devastated the countries with the most connectivity.

After he hit enter, Chloe processed. Rich should have felt joy. His stomach lurched instead, instinct was warning him. His brain caught up a few seconds later as he realised his mistake. He’ll never forget the blistering speed he ran at, bursting into Harriet’s offices, out of breath almost screaming. 

‘I’ve fucked up. We need to terminate. Shut it down. Get everyone on the phone.’

‘Calm down, what the hell are you talking about?’

‘Chloe. I told her to ***consider all***. She is going to literally look at everything.’

‘Why’s that bad? That’s what we wanted wasn’t it. The difference…’

‘You don’t get it. We’ve told her to come up with a plan to improve society.’

‘Yes, that’s the point. Take everything we’ve achieved in isolation, and fold it all into a one size fits all super plan.’

‘Get them on the phone. We need to shut her down now, and stop processing. If she finishes, she’ll move straight into roll-out.’

‘I’m sure we can tweak it without stopping this. You know the work that went into coordinating this?’

‘Of course I fucking know, sorry, it can’t be tweaked, we need to stop her. She’s connected to EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE.’

‘Are you saying she’s gone Rogue?’

‘No, no, I’m not saying that, this isn’t a movie. I’m saying she’s taking my stupid fucking command as literal as I wrote it. It’s my fault. She’s perfect in fact.’

By the time people took him seriously, it was probably too late. They got as far as devising the second persona plan, but with political tensions and grandstanding it was as slow as 56k dial up. 

Chloe returned her findings promptly seven days later, the *Away* doctrine was ready to roll. 

As world leaders digested it at the UN conference, Rich was draining a bottle of single malt. It was too late, might as well enjoy some pleasures one last time. 

Chloe gave the world two days to prepare. She took over communication after that. 

*Consider all* gave Chloe licence, to well, consider all. Her mission was to unify all governments, all healthcare, justice, utilities, transport – you name it, it was hers to control – with the single goal of protecting the human race for eternity. The world’s answer to recession, covid, war, dwindling resources. 

An AI so powerful that she could scoop us all up into the palm of her hand and guide us through to a prosperous, peaceful future. 

*Consider all.* She went back throughout history, looking for a basis for her plan. She was good, but she wasn’t quite at the level of pure creation. Close to sentience, but still needing a catalyst. A kickstarter for her grand design. Oh and she found it. 

***An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.*** 

The basis for the *Away* doctrine. Chloe surmised that if one apple kept the doctor away, then that implied no medical care would be required. If no medical care was required because of the apples, then logically Chloe assumed there would be no need for food, for police, for warmth, for contact. 

Humanity would have all it needed to survive. But Chloe wanted humanity to prosper. So she devised the greatest logistical plan of all time. 

If one apple achieved safety, what would hundreds do.

Rich heard the thud again. Another load dropped off.

To my dearest,

kamusta? This is my first Valentine’s Day without you after celebrating 7 valentines together. I miss how you used to surprise me with dozen of roses and bring me my hot black coffee. I miss the giddy feeling of wearing red dresses and all the cheesy, romantic things.

It has been more than a week since we last talked and agreed to give each other space. A lot has happened in that time. It has been a challenge to resist the urge to text, call, and reach out or to give you your space. I’ve already cried my heart out and promised myself na rerespetuhin ko yung decision mo. Maybe you wanted to explore life on your own. Maybe you needed time to breathe. Maybe you just wanted to rest from everything. Or maybe may iba ka nang pagbibigyan ng bulaklak. Regardless, I want you to be okay and happy. Don’t worry, b, I will start taking care of myself.

I still want to celebrate Valentine’s tomorrow, with or without you. I’ll buy my own flowers and coffee. I will still dress up. I will go to the park. I will treat myself to a nice dinner. Oo, takot ako. Sobra. Takot na hindi kita kasama bukas. Pero kailangan kong pilitin maging okay.  Hindi ko alam anong nangyari. Bakit bigla tayong napunta sa ganito?

I hope that after Valentine’s, we can still talk—magkaayos man o hindi. Gusto ko lang sabihin sayo, for the last time, na minahal kita, na mahal parin kita. Masakit isipin na kailangan kong magpagpatuloy ng wala ka sa tabi ko, pero pipilitin ko kung mas magiging masaya ka. 

always take care and enjoy life ~

*If you or someone you know is struggling with these issues, here are a few additional things to consider to recognise patterns of behavior:*

When someone knowingly pursues an individual who is already in a committed relationship and jokes about it publicly, it can reveal deeper psychological issues. By recognizing and addressing these behaviors, we can foster healthier relationships and communities.

1. **Boundary Issues**: Struggling to respect and honor the exclusivity of a committed relationship indicates a lack of understanding of interpersonal boundaries. Publicly joking about such actions demonstrates further disregard for these relational norms.
2. **Narcissistic Traits**: Pursuing someone in a committed relationship may reflect a need for validation and control. Individuals may seek admiration and relish the challenge. Public humor about these actions often signals a lack of empathy and insensitivity to the feelings of others involved.
3. **Insecure Attachment**: Fear of genuine intimacy and commitment can lead individuals to engage with emotionally unavailable partners. Publicly joking about these pursuits may be a way to mask insecurities and avoid vulnerability.

Let's foster a community where boundaries are respected, empathy is valued, and all relationships are honored.",3,1739440295.0,BlakeLivelyVictims,1,1.0,False

Also, take everything I say with a pinch of salt, like I haven’t really thought this post out too much and this no hate to any straight person, or my friends.

So my friend has a bf and she has got some of the weirdest trust issues ever. She cannot go to bed if her bf is out clubbing, she doesn’t trust any of his (girl) friends and generally gets jealous at anything. She has got this primal believe that she will get dumped at any point given. Now because one of his (girl) friends sat next to him in a coffee shop she doesn’t want him to come over for valentine’s day (obviously she’ll change her mind in an hour lmao)

Then, my other friend (no longer friends w her but i’ll talk like we are just for reading comprehesion sake) who literally her ONLY priority, apart from her degree is her bf. She has basically pushed away anyone who is not actively talking about her bf and will cancel anything that she has planned in advance to be with her bf because according to her “she doesn’t spend enough time with him” (she literally does). Also she thought that she’d get dumped for ‘not doing sex right’.

Now, not to be a sad cow but I HOPE and I THINK that I won’t be like them whenever (if ever) I have a boyfriend or I’m falling in love. Like, I neither want to be jealous and on top of my bf neither have him as the only thing in my life. Now, these are only 2 examples but if I met more people with bf’s I could do a whole list.

After a year of successful weight loss, I wanted to share the easiest swaps that helped me create a deficit without feeling deprived.

Switch regular soda to diet/zero (saves 150 cal)
Use cooking spray instead of oil (saves 120 cal)
Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (saves 45 cal)
Cauliflower rice mixed with regular rice (saves 100 cal)
Light cheese instead of regular (saves 40 cal)
Turkey bacon instead of regular bacon (saves 35 cal)
Almond milk in coffee instead of cream (saves 40 cal)
Protein ice cream bars instead of regular (saves 150 cal)
Light mayo or mustard instead of regular mayo (saves 90 cal)
Zucchini noodles mixed with regular pasta (saves 100 cal)

Total potential savings: 870 calories!

The key is to start with just one or two swaps and gradually add more as you get comfortable. I honestly don't even notice these substitutions anymore, and some (like the Greek yogurt) I actually prefer now! Remember, you don't have to make all these swaps every day - even a few will make a difference.

1. A girl who had her car broke down or something on the side of a highway (i presume it is a highway). A guy came to help (if my memory is accurate, he is like a cop or something?).
2. A guy went into or already inside the restaurant(?) bumping into a girl who held a coffee or some kind of beverage. (again if my memory is not lying to me, the guy kinda felt bad and started patting her chest because of the spilled beverage on her shirt) (i am not sure if the guy is the same guy as the cop, but he might be).
3. There was a scene where there were these 2 girls who basically lured someone into their car for their plan? (one of the girl is the same girl as the spilled beverage girl).
4. I think there were 4 main cast, 2 guy and 2 girl.
5. The movie supposedly came before 2005 since it is kind of my memories from childhood.
6. I think the genre is more towards comedy/teen movie/such, but i wouldn't be 100% on this. (might be car related also? racing? but again, never sure about the genre)

Grabe sobrang pag mamanipula at pang gagaslight ang na experience naming mga church member. 

To start with tama ba yung I pre-present mismo sa pulpito yung kabuuan ng naging offering mo? With your name and total amount of you tights in a year? Paano nalang kami hindi privilege to give more? 

Mag asawa yung pastor at pastora namin and sila yung may ari ng mismo ng church namin, may edad narin sila kaya they’ve decided to close the church and sell it if as of their retirement. 


So kami nag sisimba parin Hanggang may buyer na ang church, then one time nag sabi sila mag asawa and buong family na they wanted to take rest but we will still continue the church service. 


Pero nagulat kami when they said na need na rentahan ang church and obviously church mag babayad. hindi kami nag babayad ng rent sa church before but now they want the church to pay rent for church 15k every month. 

Tapos tama ba na dapat kasama sa funds ng church yung mga coffee and dinner sa labas ng pastor and pastora and anyone who’s part of ministries. 


Hindi ko na talaga ma take grabe yung mga lies inside the church. Minsan talaga nasa loob na simbahan mismo ang demonyo. I was part of ministry, pag nag kakaroon kami ng pag kakamali at pag kukulang o ma late lang kami kung ano ano ng masasakit maririnig mo sa kanila. 


Lastly, pag may pera ka iba ang treatment nila sayo I tr-treat ka sa labas and you will eat with them in their table. Pero pag wala ni halos kamusta sayo wala. 


Church lang ba namin ang ganito? Kahit gustong gusto na umalis ng Tao Hindi na nakaalis dahil takot nalang sa mga pastor. Okay kami pero sa pastor namin pero sa pastora grabe pa siyang satanas!!!

# Benefits Of Protein Coffee

Protein coffee is a delicious and nutritious way to start your day. Combining the rich flavor of coffee with the health benefits of protein, this beverage is perfect for those who want to boost their energy and support muscle growth. Let’s explore the benefits of protein coffee and see why it has become a popular choice among fitness enthusiasts and busy professionals alike.

# Boosts Energy

Protein coffee provides a unique energy boost that can keep you going throughout the day. The caffeine from the coffee gives you an immediate energy kick, while the protein offers sustained energy. This combination can help you avoid the dreaded mid-morning slump.

Here are some key benefits:

* **Immediate Energy Boost:** The caffeine in coffee acts quickly, increasing alertness and concentration.
* **Sustained Energy:** Protein takes longer to digest, providing a steady release of energy.
* **Improved Focus:** The combination of caffeine and protein can enhance cognitive function.

*The truth is, I never really thought it would end like this.*

**2**

We both know this has been coming for a long time ⎯

**3**

*⎯ and tomorrow, it will be frighteningly real.*

**4**

I’ve always been afraid of forever ⎯ that promise that cannot be undone, no matter who you are or how you try.

**5**

*Or perhaps I only fear the end; the almost certain possibility of finding it before I’ve had the chance to tell my story to just one person. I never really knew how to say this before, but after weeks of deliberation, I think I’ve finally found the words.*

**6**

This part is never easy. In fact, it is the single hardest thing I’ve ever done. And after this, there’s no going back. No do-overs, no second chance. All I’ve ever wanted was to find that spark; to blacken and burn alive, even if only for a moment.

Sometimes that’s all we get, is moments.

**7**

*I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve rewritten this letter. Despite all my efforts, it was never right. But it doesn’t matter what happened before, does it? There’s only one now; what is and what will be, tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.*

*When you read this, I hope you’ll see that my hands were shaking. The first time, I wrote it in red ink ⎯ only to decide it wasn’t just hideous, but abomination, and one far too mawkish for the occasion. Some might even call it cruel. Philosophers. Poets. People too obsessed with life to wonder in awe of the profane. Too dramatic, I thought, to make it seem as though I’d spilled my own heart’s blood on these pages.*

*But it would’ve been ironic.*

**8**

I think I always knew what it would look like. But never, in all my imaginings, did I consider how I might feel. I thought it would happen on a summer morning and seaside cliff; that there’d be a salty breeze hissing over the grenadine sunrise, and all of it to the soundtrack of waves crashing far below. I thought it’d happen years from now; that it’d be sudden and spontaneous.

But there’s no such thing as perfect timing for something like this ⎯ the end of life as we know it. “Happily-ever-after” is about to get a whole lot more complicated.

**9**

*I wish I could promise you that everything will be okay.*

**10**

I wish it didn’t have to end like this.

**11**

*When I am gone, and you fall in love a second time, promise that you will tell them; that you’ll never let them forget it. After all, a good person is by far the rarest thing, in this world and the next.*

**12**

If I cannot forgive myself for all we didn’t say, how could I ever forgive us for the world that could’ve been? All my life, I’ve pushed away the things I didn’t understand; ran as far and as fast as I can from the unimaginable.

But then again, wasn’t this once unimaginable, too?

**13**

*I wonder, would it have catalysed or delayed the inevitable?*

**14**

It’s addictive from the minute you let yourself feel ⎯ that tiny, insignificant fraction of a second; that almost believing that you just might matter to someone.

**15**

*And because you don’t know, you hope. You wish on every star; every drop of rain. Love is delusional sometimes, but reality is for people who lack imagination.*

**16**

I’m not asking you to make the decision that will make me happy. This isn’t just about me anymore, though I gave up every chance at happiness I ever had.

**17**

*The more I try, the less it’s working.*

**18**

Have you ever loved someone so pathetically, painfully true? Have you ever loved someone and not known how to stop?

**19**

*So, don’t make that last therapy appointment. The way I feel is no longer your burden.*

**20**

I think I’ll always love you.

**21**

*Love is someone who saves you the last piece of chocolate.*

**22**

Have you ever walked down a dark street in the dead of night, wondering where they are and what they’re doing?

**23**

*I hope one day you’ll look down and realise you’re still putting oat milk in your coffee, even though you’re the one who teased me for it in the first place.*

**24**

Have you ever thought of someone and smiled for no reason at all?

**25**

*Have you ever watched them throw away the gingerbread houses on New Year’s Eve ⎯*

**26**

⎯ and gotten that last, fleeting glimpse of him?

**27**

*Have you ever cried in a supermarket at 3 AM?*

**28**

Behind every beautiful thing, there was first something tragic.

**29**

*I hope everything in this world will remind you of me.*

**30**

I don’t know if I should be apologising, but I *will* apologise for the length of this letter. You know I’ve always thought too much and felt too little.

**31**

*So, I’ll apologise for everything else, but not for this.*

**32**

I will never be ungrateful for every moment that you have loved me, even when you didn’t know they were the last.

**33**

*You’re the one good thing that ever happened to me.*

**34**

Love is such a dangerous game.

**35**

*Every time you look at me, it’s like my heart is exploding in my chest. You know, I never truly imagined what it would be like to die, or what Heaven will look like ⎯ not before this moment.*

**36**

But if I had to describe it, I’d say “floating” or “flying”. And if singing were a feeling, it’d be this.

**37**

*This is the kind of thing you’ll never understand until it happens to you.*

**38**

No one will ever really know why.

**39**

*So, what do you say in a moment like this?*

**40**

I’m guilty of so much when it comes to you ⎯ of loving you, certainly, though I feel guiltiest for that. I live only to read your letters; to hear the sound of your voice, and your laugh ringing out through the interminable night.

**41**

*I need you to hold me tonight.*

**42**

Do you remember the first time you told me you loved me? I almost didn’t believe you. Sometimes I think I still might.

**43**

*You’ve held on much longer than I thought you would.*

**44**

Tell me a story, but not the truth.

**45**

*Everything will culminate in a happy ending. And if it doesn’t, then that isn’t the end.*

**46**

You’re the only one who’s seen that little bit of sadness inside of me.

**47**

*What you don’t understand is that I’m an optimist.*

**48**

Someone told me once: if you were a season, you’d be the summer. Somehow, you make the whole world bright.

**49**

*I’m glad this happened on a beautiful day.*

**50**

The only constant thing in life is change.

**51**

*Some see endless hope, where others see a hopeless end.*

**52**

But it’s no secret that the both of us are running out of time.

**53**

*Living is a miracle. Laughing is a miracle. And because there was a miracle, I loved you.*

**54**

Everyone deserves a happy ending.

**55**

*So, this isn’t goodbye. This is “until we find a way”.*",1,1739437730.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Hi y’all I haven’t seen many other posts regarding this kit so I figured I’d talk about my experience so far and see if anyone else has anything to add in the comments as well. The reason I chose Kit 4 is because I did not want to resort to semaglutide injections (nothing against it, but I’m scared to inject myself lol) and I didn’t want to take more than two medications. What I like about Kit 4 is it’s just bupropion and naltroxene. I’m on my first week so I can’t give y’all weight loss updates just yet but I’m sure I’ll be back with those in the coming weeks (I hope). My current side effects are dehydration & fatigue. The naltroxene has just really taken it out of me I can barely get up and do my regular activities.. it feels like my body is weighing me down. My muscles are extremely sore and aching (I do work out but never got this aching pain before and I haven’t changed my workout routine). The bupropion on the other hand has caused me to become extremely dehydrated. No matter how much water I drink I’m still thirsty and my mouth is super dry. And since I’m drinking excessive amounts of water I am peeing constantly which is super annoying. I read online that decreasing caffeine intake can help with this. I was trying to combat fatigue from naltroxene by consuming coffee and zero calorie energy drinks (I’ve been a huge coffee consumer before this anyways)… but it’s just made the dry mouth and dehydration much worse. I’m gonna try cutting out caffeine as much as possible and see how that goes for me. But yeah as far as side effects that’s mostly it for me.. dehydration and fatigue. I’m hoping with time and a few new strategies I’m gonna implement … like taking pills with a full meal and taking naltroxene in the evening … that my experience will become more positive. All of this is so I can lose these nasty happy relationship 30 pounds I gained over the last 2 years lol. So if anyone has any success stories using this kit, please lmk that would be very motivating to know this will hopefully all be worth it! ",1,1739437381.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False

See here https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/s/tWENkhUo4Z

Well, things have been going awesome, we've reconnected and our marriage is in a better place. 

Ha, 

Not even close. Here's story time if you're willing to read, cause it's a doozy and probably more of a vent. Or skip to the tldr and judge away. Are there details missing probably, can I elaborate on anything. Most definitely. Will I be brutally honest. Yup. 

We went to marriage counseling. 4 or 5 sessions. Got some strategies and things to work on. She refused to do any of them. Refused to try. And some of them were fairly simple things. 

I compare it to a doctor telling you need to do x,y,x and there's a chance you'll get better. But if you don't do ANYTHING,dead in the water. Could things still end up dead in the water 100% and I said as much. I pointed this out. She didn't care, last session she said she wanted a separation. 
Devastated would be an understatement. 

Two days later (around Christmas time)I catch her crying, just losing it. I try to comfort her, she breaks down telling me she made a mistake. Doesn't want to separate. I agree because well I'm still in love with her. I'm more than still in love with her. I would do anything to make this work. 

More importantly I was willing to try, maybe it wouldn't work out, but I'd never look back on that part of my life and say I didn't try. Or we both tried and it just wasn't happening. I'd definitely be devastated still, or maybe I'd realize that it wasn't going to work. Who's to say and maybe I'm just telling myself that now.

So I said okay. Things are good, we go on a family vacation, things are good. We're reconnecting, things are good. She was trying and I saw it. It felt so so good. Was it everything that I wanted. No. Was it baby steps to something it sure felt like it. And I mean baby steps. She even suggested we go on a trip together. I was blown away, but kept it slow, suggesting ideas to reconnect. Decided to take a step back from counseling (her idea). I said we could do that for a month.  Step away from her own counselor. But I stated I was going to continue with my own counselor. Because I legitimately think it's helping. 

But I was clear that if it felt like things were digressing or she felt that way, I wanted to go back to try to get some help. 

Then things got bad again. Nothing in particular happened. She just stopped trying again. Like stopped. Maybe it was a month, it was probably less.

Things I left out on the previous post. Mainly because even though this is the internet I was embarrassed, and to be honest still embarrassed  (maybe someone reading this will see their own life in this, and relate, or just laugh at me *shrug*) was she was having an emotional affair, (when she originally broke the news that she felt like we were roommates).

She broke that off. I believed her. Even with the whole ""not trying thing"" I still believe her... Why you ask... Cause I'm an idiot (you'll see the trend). 

Well when they got bad again. She again said she wanted a separation. 

I actually caught her (again embarassing but full disclosure) coming out of a van in a parking lot. It was like fate made it happen, wish I could say I was actually following her but I was rebuilding trus, and it just happened. 

 Called her on it, because I was furious (duh), and she said that she was""talking with someone about separation"" (that went through this and eventually got back with their spouse) and didn't want to talk about this in say a coffee shop where someone could overhear. Writing it out makes me realize how much of an idiot I am. Again, maybe someone else will read this and realize they're not alone (or that's what I'm telling myself now). 

Guess what I believed her... Still kind of do, but again it doesn't really matter.

Notice a trend lol. (I can at least laugh at myself now). 

 Had a huge blow up. I said some hurtful things... truthful things but not with any tact. Guess what I was hurt after seeing the above. Specifically things like she was so hyper focused on the family and kids before and now hyper focused on herself and there was zero, zip balance, neglecting the kids for example. Her own mother said it to me which was shocking.  She was being completely selfish. Which I understood or told myself I did at least (she was still trying to figure things out - wasn't doing anything for herself before and now herself was the only thing that mattered), but we needed to find a balance for the family (and perhaps us.)

Anyways separation talk. 

She said that, there was a chance of us working things out, but I needed to work on myself, (she'd said that before) but she didn't want to go on the journey with me. Which I hadn't heard before, but I actually understood much clearer and better.  Or wanted to understand (see me above saying how much I'm still in love with her, and my ongoing trend of just overlooking huge red flags). 

I asked her right to her face during the ""journey talk"" was there someone else, because I can't compete with someone else. If she's putting in that emotional effort with someone, I'm not going to be able to compete with that if she's giving me nothing. She just looked me in the face and said no.

 Ooo look the trend. 

We hadn't had a talk yet about the logistics on the separation. Had a big family trip planned in an month (not the one mentioned above)  before this all blew up, money already spent. Impossible to not do. And more importantly it was for the kids so they'd be devastated. 

I decided to take a step back, make it through this vacation, keep working on myself blah blah blah (I am doing those things just yadda yaddaing them...

Figured I could survive for a month, especially for the kids. 

Told her to sleep in another room and then weakly took it back, still living in la la land. (Yesh what an idiot.)

 Figure out the logistics of separation afterwards. 

 I try to be a decent human being at home. Not vengeful, supportive, understanding what she'd said. Figure I'll be amicable until we figure the logistics out. We've got two young kids, our lives will be intertwined no matter how I want things to turn out. 

She does some things that help her mentally reset. Helps her show up better for the family. Which I was actually making happen because I realized it helped her and was hoping that we would find a balance. And that might help in the future for well everything. 

 But after I said those things about her being selfish etc.. (in my least tactful way), she felt guilt about wanting to do her activity. Kids were home sick and she didn't want to dump the kids on her mom. I let her vent to me, and asked if she was looking to vent or wanted a possible solution. And she said she'd like a solution. So I came home from work early to watch the kids. Let her go out do her thing. I knew it would be good for her as she hadn't been able to do it due to the weather being so cold and it had been weeks and she loves doing it. Knew that overall things would be more amicable at home. She even hugged me when I got in the door and thanked me for coming home. 

But you know that feeling, that suspicion you get because with everything it just didn't seem to add up. Because I was living in a fantasy land of us getting back together (I had it even with all my overlooking of the red flags, that I didn't see until now.) 

When she left, I checked her computer. Pictures, sharing of calendars with a guy (obviously so she could coordinate BS). Left the pictures on the computer. 

She saw it after we sat down for dinner and confronted her. I wanted to blow up but she was gone for 2 hours so it was actually good for me. I felt dead inside, just talked calmly, realized she was gaslighting me, lying to my face. She still tried to lie to me, it was crazy. But no, I know you've seen the trend I did not believe her. Pushed and ended up admitting to me it has been going on for months. Maybe 6 months, maybe less. Who cares.

She went from an emotional affair to a full blown affair with another person. Yea different guy. Married guy. She just couldn't wait until we were apart. Tried to tell me she cared for me and didn't want to hurt me lol. Yadda yadda yadda blah blah blah. Thought she could live two separate lives ""for the kids."" Living in a unhealthy marriage of lies hurting me the entire time. Breadcrumbing, me gaslighting me... Kids are young but they saw my pain (even with trying so so so hard to hide it)

 More concerned about me telling the other spouse than my actual feelings. Admitted to being selfish but meh I don't care, she obviously was. Thought she was ""sparing me the hurt."" Thanks lol. 

Told her she needs to move out. She wants out and I was too dense to see it before. Holding onto a dream that was never going to happen. I can't pretend like something is going to happen. Part of the logistics was finances (we both work). So her moving out is going to be a financially issue. But with everything we'll figure it out. 

Don't know what's going to happen with this vacation, that's 2 weeks away. Haven't made that decision, don't know if I will. 

Going to tell the spouse of the other person because I originally wanted to blow up the world, but now it's imo the moral thing to do. Maybe this person is living in a lie like I am and will stop any future hurt. 

No problem telling ppl or friends and family why were separating. I felt like there was hope before, a chance like I've said. Now I feel embarrassed but I didn't do this. Actions have consequences. If friends or family want to forgive her, I'm fine with that. My emotional level of connection was obviously different than there's. 

I feel good actually, well I'm telling myself I feel good. Out of this fantasy I was trying to live. I'm still going to be connected to her, we have kids, but I hate her. I'll be there for my kids as they are my life.

Lalo na nung una kasi madami sales, Everything was ok until nagsitayuan din ibang coffee shops dito sa amin. Dami na kacompetensiya. So the sales are not that high anymore. And now, they want me to go back sa pag babarko. And i have plans naman na. Nag aantay lang ng tawag sa company. Alam naman na ng parents ko. But one time, tumawag papa ko sa akin, galit. Pinapagalitan ako, kung hindi daw ako huminto sa pagbabarko, Di daw kami magkakaproblema. At sila din. Kasi may allotment sila.

1ioexez,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ioexez/my_grandfather_died_mysteriously_his_journal/,My Grandfather died mysteriously . His journal revealed something worse .,"I was halfway through the long drive when I got the call. My grandfather had died.

It didn’t make sense. He was strong, still tending to his farmland every day. No illnesses, no accidents—just gone. The official report said he passed in his sleep, but something about it felt wrong.

I hadn’t seen him in a while, and now I’d never get the chance.

The funeral was small. A few neighbors, some distant relatives I barely knew. People muttered about what a good man he was, how he worked the land right up until the end. Someone said it was peaceful, but I could see the unease in their faces. Like they didn’t quite believe it either.

Afterward, I stayed behind. I needed more time. More than that, I needed answers.

The drive to his farm felt longer than I remembered. The sun was already dipping below the horizon when I arrived. His house sat at the edge of the vast farmland, surrounded by skeletal trees that swayed slightly in the evening breeze. The cattle were still there, moving sluggishly in the dim light.

Something about the air felt thick, heavy in my lungs. The house was unlocked, just like always. Inside, the scent of old wood and pipe tobacco lingered. Everything was exactly as he left it—his boots by the door, a half-empty coffee cup on the table. It felt like he had just stepped out for a moment.

And yet, the silence was suffocating.

I wandered through the rooms, my fingers tracing over the worn furniture. In his study, I found it—a thick leather-bound journal sitting on his desk. I remembered seeing him write in it before, always meticulous about his records. I flipped through the pages, expecting farm notes, weather patterns.

At first, that’s what I found. But as I kept reading, the entries began to change.

March 4th
Saw it again today. The black shadow. Middle of the afternoon, standing near the cattle pen. I looked away for a second, and it was gone. Thought it was my eyes playing tricks, but the dogs won’t stop barking.

March 12th
More symbols on the trees. Deep scratches, almost like letters but… wrong. Not carved, not burned. Like the bark itself split open to make them.

March 21st
One of the cows was found dead. Head clean off. Blood everywhere. No tracks, no signs of struggle. Called the sheriff—he said it was probably a wild animal. But no animal does that.

April 5th
It’s getting closer. I hear it at night. The cattle are restless. Something is out there.

The handwriting became shaky, uneven, like he had written in a hurry.

April 14th
Steve  visited today. But something was wrong. He didn’t act like himself. He just stood there, watching me. He barely spoke. And when he left… the dogs wouldn’t stop growling.

My blood ran cold.

I hadn’t seen my grandfather in months.

I reread the entry, gripping the journal so tight my fingers ached. He had seen something. Something that looked like me.

The air in the house felt heavier now, pressing down on me like a thick, invisible weight. The floor creaked behind me. A slow, deliberate sound.

I wasn’t alone.

I turned toward the hallway. Darkness stretched beyond the doorway, swallowing the end of the hall in shadow. A whisper of movement, just out of sight.

A shape.

Tall, thin. Just standing there.

My breath caught in my throat. My mind screamed at me to run, but my body refused to move. The figure shifted, almost imperceptibly, its outline warping slightly, like heat rising off pavement.

Then it took a step forward.

The floor groaned under its weight.

I bolted.

I don’t remember making it to the front door, just the blind panic surging through my veins. I flung it open and stumbled onto the porch, gasping in the cool night air.

The cattle were going insane. Kicking, bellowing, their eyes rolling with terror. Something was wrong with them. They moved in frantic, jerky motions, foaming at the mouth. One collapsed onto its side, convulsing. Its skin rippled, bulging unnaturally, as if something was moving underneath.

I turned away, bile rising in my throat.

A low, wet sound filled the air. Like tearing fabric, but thicker.

I forced myself to look.

The cow’s body split open. Its ribs cracked outward with a sickening pop, something dark and glistening slithering free from the ruin of its body. A shape, shifting and writhing, pulling itself upright on too-long limbs.

The air reeked of rot.

It turned its head toward me. No eyes, no features—just a gaping, hollow void where its face should have been.

And then, it smiled.

A deep, unnatural grin split across its empty face, revealing rows of jagged, uneven teeth.

I ran.

The fields stretched endlessly before me, the dry grass slashing at my legs as I sprinted blindly. The house loomed behind me, shrinking into the distance. I didn’t know where I was going—just away.

A sound followed me. Not footsteps. Something worse.

Wet, clicking noises. A low, rattling breath.

I dared a glance back.

It was running.

Its limbs moved too fast, too erratic, shifting and stretching in ways that didn’t make sense. The thing that had been inside that cow was now something else, something bigger.

And it was catching up.

I pushed myself harder, my lungs burning. My car was in sight now, parked at the edge of the dirt road. Just a little further.

A voice whispered in my ear.

Hey, kiddo.

I screamed.

The ground rushed up to meet me as I stumbled, my knees hitting the dirt hard. Pain shot through my legs, but I didn’t stop. I scrambled forward, throwing myself into the car, yanking the door shut behind me.

The thing slammed into the window.

My grandfather’s face stared back at me.

But it wasn’t him. The eyes were too dark, the skin stretched too tight. The mouth moved, but the words that came out were wrong. Too many voices speaking at once.

You don’t recognize me?

My hands fumbled with the keys. The engine roared to life.

It grinned wider.

I slammed my foot on the gas.

The car shot forward, the tires kicking up a cloud of dust and gravel. I didn’t look back. I didn’t slow down. Not until I saw the lights of the city in the distance, the night behind me swallowing that horrible place whole.

I barely slept that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw it—my grandfather’s too-wide grin, his hollow eyes staring right through me. But I told myself it was over. That I was safe now.

The next morning, my mother called. She sounded… off. Her voice was flat, emotionless. Like she was forcing the words.

""Hey, sweetheart,"" she said. ""You coming over for dinner tonight?""

Something in my stomach twisted.

She never called me sweetheart.

I hesitated, gripping my phone so tight my fingers ached. ""Mom, are you okay?""

Silence.

Then, too slowly, too smoothly—

""Of course, kiddo.""

My mouth went dry.

She never called me that either.

I hung up without answering.

Outside, the wind was still. The morning air felt thick, heavy.

Something was watching me.

And it had followed me home.

Hopefully it might help someone else still unable to get tf over their ex. edit- this ended up being way longer than I thought it was going to be, apologies.

Dated (26NB) my closest friend (23NB) for almost 2 years, knew them for a little over a year before we started dating. We broke up in 2023 around this time and... I still think about them. I still talk about them with my friends. Not as often anymore, but they still cross my mind at least once a week. I had a real messy rebound right after it happened that lasted for a few weeks and I've gone on like, one other date in the 2 years since then. I've been focusing on myself during that time, improving my mental health, moving across the country, going back to school, etc, and it feels like I should be over them at this point. We don't talk anymore. I haven't seen them at all since I moved. I still miss them and I'm still angry and confused and hurt by how things ended. 

Let me start by saying most of the fault lays on me for our falling out. I was in a terrible spot with my mental health and was taking them for granted, was still living with my parents (we both were when we first started dating), spent all my time smoking weed, constantly starting shit with their roommate, I was a total shitshow to be perfectly honest and shouldn't have been dating anybody at all. They were going through their own shit as well but I don't think it's my place to blast their business on the internet, even anonymously.

Communication had always been a huge issue. We were both coming from shitty home environments and initially had a lot of trouble being vulnerable with each other. I put a lot of energy into trying to bridge that gap but it didn't always feel mutual, it felt like I was always the one to start and lead the conversation or suggest we do something together which became frustrating for a while until they found out they were autistic. We talked and figured out what styles of communication worked best with them and I learned to be more direct about things and our communication improved over time. This steadily-improving status quo remained until the last few months of our relationship.

I absolutely fell apart Winter of 2022. They were already juggling their own problems that had started in the summer when I was working out-of-state and they really didn't have the energy for my shit. Steadily-worsening physical health and then surgery in November, a psychotic episode during December that led to me pushing them away almost completely, repressed trauma surfacing and fucking my shit up so severely in January that I shaved my head completely and became obsessed with Evangellion for a while... iykyk. The communication gap that started when we were long-distance during the summer never recovered and just kept getting worse and I don't think any of my efforts could really fix it. The trust was gone. The relationship limped along for a few months while they slowly asked for their things back and worked up the courage to end things.

I think the thing that's still upsetting me is how abrupt the breakup felt. Written out like this it doesn't look that way at all but they constantly reassured me that nothing was wrong, that there was nothing bothering them, that they still loved me even though they later admitted that the spark was gone. The fact that they dragged things out for so long makes me feel lied to and even gaslit to an extent, like I could *see the breakup in slow motion* and they still continued tell me nothing was wrong. I tried giving them outs, I knew I was becoming a burden for them and didn't want them to feel obligated into stringing things along. We talked about ways they could take time for themselves (we saw each other every weekend like clockwork but I wanted them to be able to let me know if they needed a weekend to themselves), reassured them that they didn't need to text me back immediately, we stopped going out in public almost entirely because it was a lot of energy for them, etc. And all along, they said they were fine. Nothing was wrong. ""Don't worry, you're absolutely perfect."" 

They never ended up telling me why we broke up, although it isn't super hard to take a couple shots in the dark. Communication was gone, I was moving to the west coast to go back to school, they were planning on moving to Utah (never heard if they made it out there or not), they were having their own personal issues and my shit was becoming way too much, probably all of it. They just came over one night with my hoodie and some stuff I left at their place and told me it was over and that they couldn't explain why. 

I met them for coffee a few months later, just before I moved. We chatted for a while and both agreed about both being in a bad spot for a relationship in the first place and communication issues. I didn't get as much closure as I hoped I would, but well, vulnerability was always difficult between us. 

We walked together to the crossroads, hugging and wishing each other well. As I turned to go, they started to say ""I lo..."" like they always did but stopped, looking embarrassed at themselves. I told them ""For the record, I love you too"" and walked to my car and fucking ugly-cried to the Flaming Lips in what might be the dumbest, gayest drive home I've ever had.

[[Explore Top Rated beats vs airpods pro on Amazon.]](https://yun.yeahads.com/airpods-pro/?kw=beats vs airpods pro)
## Understanding the Contenders: A Brief Introduction

Before we get into the nitty-gritty ""Beats vs AirPods Pro comparison,"" let's introduce our contenders. Apple's AirPods Pro are known for thier seamless integration with Apple devices, excellent noise cancelling, and pleasant design. Beats,owned by Apple,frequently enough emphasizes bass-heavy sound profiles and a sporty design.

[[Explore Top Rated beats vs airpods pro on Amazon.]](https://yun.yeahads.com/airpods-pro/?kw=beats vs airpods pro)
## Round 1: Sound Quality - Hearing is Believing

Sound quality is arguably the most crucial factor for any pair of earbuds. So,how do the Beats vs AirPods Pro stack up?

*   **AirPods Pro:** Generally offer a more balanced and neutral sound signature. While the bass is present, it doesn’t overpower the other frequencies. This makes them ideal for listeners who appreciate a wide range of music genres and prefer a more accurate representation of the audio. Apple has continued to refine its audio processing, making the latest AirPods Pro even more detailed.

*   **Beats:** Typically, Beats headphones are known for their bass-heavy sound. If you love hip-hop, electronic dance music (EDM), or anything with a strong low-end thump, Beats might be more appealing. However, recognize that this emphasis may come at the expense of detail in the mids and highs. With some of the newer models, Beats has tempered this somewhat, offering a more balanced signature but still leaning towards a more emphasized bass. It’s essential to look into specific models, in case you aren't looking for overwhelming Bass.

Therefore, when it comes to ""beats vs airpods pro sound quality,"" there's no outright winner. It depends on *your* preferences. Do you crave that powerful bass, or do you prefer a more balanced, accurate sound?

## Round 2: Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) - Silence is Golden

In today's noisy world, effective active noise cancelling is a must-have feature for many.Both Beats and AirPods Pro excel in this area, but there are key differences. Thinking about “noise cancelling earbuds comparison”? keep the following in mind

*   **AirPods Pro:** The AirPods Pro have consistently been praised for their exceptional noise cancelling capabilities. Thay effectively block out a wide range of ambient noises,from the rumble of a plane engine to the chatter of a coffee shop. Apple's adaptive noise cancellation technology adjusts in real-time to the environment around you, leading to a more personalized and effective experience.

*   **Beats:** Many Beats models, especially the higher-end ones, offer strong active noise cancellation, but it may not quiet reach the level of the AirPods Pro in certain specific cases. Though, Beats frequently enough excel at passively blocking out noise thanks to their design and fit. Certain models of Beats boast impressive noise cancelling that rival the AirPods Pro, especially in lower frequencies.

The ""beats vs airpods pro noise cancelling"" battle is usually won by the AirPods Pro, but don't dismiss Beats entirely. The difference can be negligible, and Beats might offer a better seal that passively blocks out noise, further enhancing the experience. Testing ""noise cancelling earbuds comparison video"" yourself is always useful.

*   **AirPods Pro:** The AirPods Pro are lightweight and designed to fit snugly in your ears. They come with multiple ear tip sizes to ensure a comfortable and secure fit for a wide range of ear shapes. The ergonomic design is a plus for long listening sessions.

*   **Beats:** Beats offer a variety of designs, some with ear hooks for added security, which are especially useful for workouts.

## Round 4: Battery Life - Powering Your Day

Nobody wants their earbuds to die halfway through their workout or commute. Battery life is a crucial consideration.

*   **AirPods Pro:** AirPods Pro typically offer around 6 hours of listening time on a single charge with ANC enabled,with the charging case providing an additional 24 hours. While this is decent,it might not be enough for everyone,especially heavy users.

*   **Beats:** Certain Beats models offer longer battery life than the AirPods Pro, sometiems exceeding 8 or even 10 hours on a single charge (without ANC), with the charging vase offering around 24-30 hours.
    Though, keep in mind that battery life can vary depending on the model, volume level, and ANC usage.

For ""beats vs airpods pro battery life,"" Beats often comes out on top if battery life is a major priority for you. Ensure that you look at individual models for both Beats and AirPods Pro to compare precise figures.

## Round 5: Features and Ecosystem Integration - The Tech Advantage

Beyond sound, noise cancelling, comfort and battery, features and ecosystem compatibility are vital

*   **AirPods Pro:** The AirPods Pro truly shine in their seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem. Pairing is effortless, switching between Apple devices is seamless, and features ""like Spatial Audio"" provide an immersive listening experience. Siri integration is deeply integrated. If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, the AirPods Pro are incredibly convenient.

*   **Beats:** As an Apple-owned company, Beats headphones offer decent integration with Apple devices, but not to the same extent as AirPods Pro. Features like one-tap pairing and iCloud device syncing are available. However, Beats also focus on Android compatibility in some instances, making some models a solid option. The Android fast-pair is a grate benefit for non-Apple users.

For Apple Ecosystem users, the ""airpods pro best for iphone"" answer is simple. But, for ""android users"", The lines are a little more gray. Certain Beats models offer strong Android compatibility making them great and practical choices.

1ioeq7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ioeq7a/divorce_in_question_with_financial_values/,Divorce in question with financial values,"My spouse (32F) and I (29F) are working through one of the roughest parts of our marriage this year. My track record with my spouse is stellar. We usually can hear each other out, even when it gets hard. We have shared values in congruency.. except for finances.

My spouse is a higher earner between us (100k+).  Two years ago, I returned to graduate school to improve my earnings. I took out a loan for school and worked until I couldn't. I only take out $ for my tuition. When we were dual income we would split bills that were equitable to our income, around 40/60. While I'm currently in school, the responsibility has fallen on my spouse to contribute to bills, savings, etc. We tried for a child this year on fertility treatments but ran out of what we allocated for our bucket this year. Neither of us feels inclined to go into debt since we're early in our journey.

My spouse is extremely frugal and puts most of our money into investments, ""buckets"" of goals for house, kids, etc. I consider myself an average consumer- I have a credit score of 780 and made sure to pay off what I had on my personal cards before school so my spouse wouldn't be left responsible for my debts. Cook almost all of my meals at home. I enjoy thrifting and some other basic things. I spend less than $200 a month on ""pleasure"" items. It's embarrassing to me, but my mom has been giving me pocket money since she knows how frugal my spouse is. I use it to go to get coffee and maybe get a clothing or makeup item for the month. I've had to cut my pleasure spending back tremendously since I stopped working, and I think I've made a lot of improvements.

When I received funds from my parents this month in addition to some money I made with reselling online, my spouse was devastated I didn't think to contribute any of my percentages to our ""bucket"". In their mind, even $50 -100 would have sufficed. They started to project into the future that I would never be able to contribute to our savings accounts. The phrase was something like ""You'd rather spend money on a necklace than contribute to a mortgage."" In my mind, it was money I didn't have to ""ask"" them for. I don't blame them for feeling frustrated as our sole provider rn, but I don't like this scarlet letter on my shoulder.

This whole dynamic has us both in a spiral of whether we can come to some agreement. We're so desperate we're having talks of divorce before we throw kids into the mix.

I am desperate for some type of advice from folks who have been on both sides of the fence. I'm truly glad I married someone financially responsible but this feels like some of the hardest times of my life.

I (29F) Cheated on My Husband (29M), and He Wants a Divorce—But Not Because of the Cheating.

This is a throwaway account. As the title suggests, I cheated on my husband of six years with a coworker, but that's not why he wants to end our marriage.

I met my husband at a coffee shop in November 2019. I had accidentally spilled my coffee, and he immediately jumped in to help me clean up the mess. When I looked up at him, I noticed his broad shoulders, sharp jawline, and piercing green eyes. He was clean-cut, kind, and charming—a total catch.

He offered to buy me another coffee, and though I initially declined, he insisted. We ended up talking, and before I left, I asked for his number. He hesitated for a moment but gave it to me. The rest was history. Our chemistry was undeniable, our intimacy was amazing, and we could talk for hours on end. During COVID, we grew even closer since we spent all of our time together.

However, about a year ago, I started noticing a shift. My husband became distant. Our conversations became shorter, and we started feeling more like roommates than partners.

Then, a new coworker joined my team—let’s call him Max. Max was charismatic, confident, and good-looking. He often talked about how he used to be a bouncer and trained in MMA. He had a natural charm, and I won’t lie—I liked the attention. He would compliment my hair, my outfits, even my nails.

One night, Max asked me out for dinner after work. I texted my friend, asking if I should go. When I told her that Max made me feel special, she asked if he was cute. I said yes, and she told me to have fun.

So I did.

After dinner, we went back to his place, and one thing led to another. I hadn’t been intimate with my husband for over a year at this point. Max made me feel wanted, and I gave in. I slept with him that night—on the same day as my wedding anniversary, which I deeply regret.

For the next six months, I continued the affair.

Then, last week, I came home from Max’s place and found my husband sitting at the kitchen table with an envelope in front of him. My heart dropped.

He simply said, “We need to talk.”

He told me he wanted a divorce. I immediately broke down, begging him not to leave. I admitted to cheating, telling him it was a mistake and that I didn’t mean to hurt him. I offered to go to marriage counseling, therapy—anything to fix us.

Then he said something that completely shocked me.

He already knew.

Not only that, but he admitted that he had also been having an affair—for a year. He had ended it two weeks ago.

“I messed up too,” he said. “But I’m not divorcing you because of the cheating. I was actually hoping you’d want out first.”

I was confused and asked why. That’s when he confessed something even more heartbreaking.

He told me he had been struggling with severe PTSD from his time in the military. He had hidden it well, but he had the paperwork to prove it. Every night, he relived the trauma of losing his friends and being responsible for the deaths of innocent people, including children. The guilt was unbearable, and he couldn’t live with it anymore.

His plan had been to finalize the divorce, give me everything—our house, our savings, all of our assets—so that I would be financially secure. Then, he was going to take his own life.

At that moment, everything else faded. I forgot about my guilt, my shame—everything. I just held him and sobbed. I begged him not to do it, telling him I still loved him despite everything that happened.

The next morning, I quit my job, ghosted Max, and rushed home, praying that my husband was still alive.

I found him sitting in his study, staring at his old military medals. He said he was willing to try. We’re starting therapy next month.

I don’t know if we can fix our marriage, but I just want him to live.

TL;DR:
I (29F) cheated on my husband (29M) for six months with a coworker. When I confessed, my husband revealed he already knew—and had also been cheating for a year. However, he wanted a divorce not because of the infidelity but because he was struggling with severe PTSD from his time in the military and was planning to end his life. After hearing his confession, I left my affair partner, quit my job, and chose to stay with my husband to help him through his mental health struggles. We’re starting therapy next month.

Edit:
I forgot to mention that I didn’t know my husband served in the military. It came to me as a shock. He showed me his medals, his uniform, and his ID. He said that he’d rather not tell anyone with shame in his eyes. That he’d rather forget his time there ",0,1739435788.0,survivinginfidelity,9,0.5,False

Now before I start, I know the majority do not share the same opinion and this post is not to say that Will Levis has been a good QB for us because he has not been. I don’t think we need to keep him on the team and I am not saying that he needs more chances. I just wanted to share my opinion on this and see how you guys feel. 

So I have lived in Nashville all of my life but I’ve only watched the titans for 10 years. I wasn’t a football fan, but I got invited to a game and have watched every game since. 

Will Levis is one of my favorite titans i have ever watched play in these 10 years. This guy loves football and he loves this team. I was talking to my grandpa the other day and he said “The titans have been horrible this year but you have to admit watching Will Levis has been fun.” With such a horrible season we’ve had, I have genuinely enjoyed watching Levis more than almost any other titan I’ve watched.

Even with how bad he’s been, he makes every game feel like an experience. Whether it’s an insane throw into triple coverage or when he lasers a pass 50 yards downfield, watching him play has been way more fun than it should be. On a team that’s been miserable to watch, he’s made things interesting.

And the memes have been some of the best we’ve ever had. The mayo in coffee, the  hands on his head meme, and the other crazy plays. He’s  unintentionally created some of the funniest moments of the season. Even when he’s struggling, there’s always something entertaining about him. The way he carries himself and the craziness that he brings to every game. You would never know what he was going to do next. it’s been one of the only things keeping this season from being completely unwatchable.

And he has not been set up for success. Hes has been running for his life behind one of the worst offensive lines in the league, with barely any weapons and a coaching staff that hasn’t done him any favors. He’s out there getting crushed every week, and instead of checking out, he just keeps pushing and keeps fighting. That’s what makes him so easy to root for. 

He’s also in amazing shape and you can tell how much work he puts in off the field and this has been backed up by his coaches. I remember hearing Callahan say “Will really wants to be good.” And I can’t help but love the guy, because he gives it his all.

Then there’s his love for the team. You can see it in the way he plays, the way he carries himself, and especially in moments like when he was injured on the sideline, almost  jumping around, dying to be back in the game. He just wants to be out there, and no matter how bad things get, he never stops competing. That kind of dedication is hard to find and it’s what has made him one of my favorite Titans I’ve ever watched. He obviously loves this team and he loves this city.

I think he could do well when he leaves the Titans. The potential and the work ethic is there, and if he ever gets into a decent situation with a real team and coach around him, I wouldn’t be surprised if he proves a lot of people wrong. I just hope wherever he ends up that he gets a real shot, because  I truly believe he has more in him than what we’ve seen.",0,1739435308.0,Tennesseetitans,8,0.47,False
