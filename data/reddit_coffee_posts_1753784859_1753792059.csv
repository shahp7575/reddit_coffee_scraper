So I sometimes watch this YouTuber Coffee and Cults who talks about pop culture, and she spoke about the Yellowjackets bonus episode. She said she talked to someone who had read the script but not seen the episode. She obviously can’t reveal her source but said you can take her word or not. She said the bonus episode was this: 

* Bonus episode is lore of Cabin daddy 
* Cabin daddy has a Cabin wife (played by Annabelle Wallace)
* Cabin wife’s character is an author, so the couple go to the cabin so that she can write her book. She’s writing while cabin daddy is out hunting and providing for them etc 
* Cabin wife is pregnant through the episode and gives birth while they are at the cabin 
* Cabin wife starts to lose her mind and the baby is crying a lot- apparently this was supposed to tie in to Shauna saying ‘can’t you hear him cry’ 
* So cabin wife is losing her mind and at one point in the episode she randomly starts to see this little girl coming to the cabin; you see this girl throughout the episode and it’s never clear if she is real or not (a figment in Cabin wife’s mind) apparently the little girl was supposed to tie in to season 2- eg the ‘friend’ Javi talks about and who was in his drawing
* Javi got the queen card from the little girl 
* Apparently there are deleted scenes from season 2 of Javi, showing him talking to someone, or showing a hand or a bit of hair to indicate a little girl 
* Coach Ben talking to the little girl shows what we were supposed to see with Javi
* The dripping- cabin daddy was supposed to fix a leak that he never fixed, which is what Mari hears. 
* The episode ends very dark- the baby is killed, then cabin wife takes her life. Cabin daddy comes back and sees his family is gone and kills himself. Apparently the death of the baby is supposed to be ambiguous, was it killed was it a sacrifice etc
* The little girl draws the symbol on the trees 

She mentions that the episode is meant to be very ambiguous just like the show with the wilderness vs reality and you’re not sure if the little girl is real etc 

She starts talking about Yellowjackets bonus episode at 2.12.00

These sleeves⁢ provide a crucial layer of defense against scratches, ​bumps, ‌and minor spills, ensuring your laptop ‌remains in pristine condition whether you're commuting to work, traveling, or simply​ storing it at​ home.

This review showcases​ the best 15-inch ⁣laptop‍ sleeves available in 2025, focusing on durability, ​design,⁣ functionality, and‍ value.‍ We've carefully evaluated each option to present ‌a complete guide that helps you choose the ⁣perfect sleeve to meet your⁢ individual needs ​and preferences.

## Key ⁤Features Analysis

the ideal 15-inch laptop sleeve should offer a blend of protection, portability, and convenience. The following features are critical considerations when ‍making your selection.

**padding Thickness and Material**

The amount and type of ⁣padding​ significantly impact​ the level of protection a sleeve offers. Look for sleeves with at least 5mm of high-density foam or‌ gel padding. These materials effectively cushion⁤ your laptop from impacts and absorb the impact of drops. A sleeve should also use a soft interior lining, such as microfiber⁢ or fleece,‍ to prevent ‌scratches⁤ on the laptop's surface.

**External Material Durability**

The exterior of the sleeve should‌ be constructed⁤ from a durable ‍and‍ water-resistant material.common options include ballistic nylon,polyester canvas,and neoprene. Ballistic nylon is known for ‌its exceptional tear resistance, while polyester canvas ⁤offers a good balance of ‍durability and affordability. ​Neoprene provides excellent water resistance and a snug fit. Reinforce the stitching⁣ at stress points, such as ⁢the corners and zipper areas, to ensure ⁣long-lasting reliability.

**Closure Mechanism**

The closure ⁤mechanism ‌prevents the laptop from⁤ falling ‌out and‍ keeps dust​ and ‍debris away. Zipper closures‌ are the most common, offering a secure and reliable​ seal. Look for zippers that are smooth and easy to operate, with sturdy pulls. Magnetic closures ⁣are quieter and more convenient, but they may not ⁤offer the‍ same level of security as zippers. Velcro closures are‌ also available,‍ but⁤ they⁢ can wear out over time and ⁤may attract lint.**Additional Storage Pockets**

Consider whether you need extra pockets ‌for accessories such as chargers, cables, mice, and pens. A dedicated accessory ‍pocket ⁤can definitely help you stay organized and avoid carrying a separate bag⁣ for these ‌items. look for pockets that are spacious enough to accommodate your accessories without adding⁢ excessive bulk to the sleeve. Elastic⁣ bands or straps ⁣within ‍the pockets ‌can help secure⁢ items​ and prevent them from shifting‍ around.

**Overall Dimensions and Fit**

The‌ sleeve should‍ provide a snug and ‍secure ⁣fit without being⁤ too‍ tight or too loose. Check the ‍internal dimensions of the sleeve to‍ ensure⁤ they are‌ compatible with your specific 15-inch ‍laptop model. A sleeve ‍that is too small may be challenging to close,while a sleeve that is too large may not provide adequate ⁤protection. It's ‌critically ⁣important to measure your‍ laptop's⁤ dimensions⁣ (length, width, and thickness) before purchasing a sleeve.**Design and Aesthetics**

While protection is paramount, the sleeve's design also matters.Choose⁢ a style that​ complements your personal⁢ taste and⁢ professional image. Sleeves are available⁣ in various colors, patterns, and materials. Consider whether ⁤you prefer a⁢ minimalist‍ design or ⁣a more elaborate one with extra features such as handles⁣ or shoulder straps.

**Water​ Resistance:** Many laptop sleeves are made from water-resistant materials that protect‍ your laptop from spills ‌and light rain. This feature⁤ is especially useful for commuters who are exposed to the ‌elements during their daily travels. Even a brief exposure to‌ moisture can damage the sensitive electronic components of a laptop, so ​a water-resistant sleeve provides an extra layer of ⁤protection.

**Association and Convenience:** Sleeves with additional storage pockets‌ allow you to keep your accessories organized and easily accessible. You ⁤can store your charger, mouse, ‍cables, and pens in ​the pockets, eliminating the need for a separate accessory bag.

I went virtually my entire senior year of high school without making any friends, and my place of work, while definitely full of some amazing people, hasn't brought me any luck with making good, close friends. It's been a lonely year of just losing people to sudden death, and I think I'm finally ready to put myself out there and meet someone new to go out and do stuff with. 

I enjoy reading, though don't expect me to be quick with it, and I love discussing stories with people and theories as I read them. I have an interest in writing, though above all, I love baking more than anything and am hoping to gain more skill in the field when I find a good bakery to work at. I'm not planning on college at the moment, though it's still a possibility. 

I feel like this city is a lot more than I give it credit for, and I would love to actually get around to seeing things. But, honestly, I don't know where to start, and I feel weird going out just by myself. 

I live near the Southgate Mall and, I don't know, I guess it would just be fun to actually connect with other people my age.

1mc9yaa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mc9yaa,AIO by my best friend/roommate’s response to me setting a boundary?,"hi guys, this is my first big post so i’m sorry if i’m not great at explaining!

hopefully the screenshots are helpful to the story. basically, me (F20) and my friend “K” (F20) have been best friends pretty much ever since we were little and we just started living together around a year or so ago (and yes i now know it’s a bad idea to live with friends!!). it’s me, my boyfriend, and her in a two bedroom, two bath apartment.

other than an incident with my birthday, we’ve honestly been doing alright up until these past few months, besides how messy she is. i have to constantly clean up after her and wipe down surfaces, vacuum, or pick up messes or expired food she’s left behind, but i never really mentioned any of it to her because i didn’t want to upset her, and i also hate confrontation (which i’m working on i promise! i know this is a bad trait of mine).

anyways, a couple weeks ago she messaged me and asked about having a friend of hers from our home town take over her lease for the two months that she’s staying at her new apartment, and i was so surprised! to me, the way that she phrased it made it seem like i didn’t really have a choice in the matter and it was just the girl’s decision whether or not she would come, so i became defensive and sent the text message stating my boundary with her (illegal) idea. i then did not respond to her messages after as i stupidly assumed the conversation was over, and i was also being slightly petty since she leaves me on read almost every time i message her. after this conversation, she stopped sharing her location with me so i also stopped sharing mine. she also moved all of the stools and wall decorations into her room, but i thought she was just packing up to move, i didn’t think it was anything petty.

fast forward to a few days ago, and my boyfriend messages the groupchat with all three of us saying the total for our electric bill. she then responds saying okay and that she would pay $50 for the next two electric bills, and my boyfriend mentions how our cat snuck into her room (like he loves to do, sneaky little bastard) and we noticed the fan was on when we went to grab him, so we were going to shut it off. she then responded passive aggressively and i decided to privately message her about it and see why she was so upset and what was wrong, as i still didn’t know she was mad at me for our last discussion.

she left me on read for that night and up until around noon the next day, when she then responded with the long text i showed in my screenshots that basically said that we had outgrown each other and i showed where my priorities lie by only texting her when she responded rudely to my boyfriend. she also said that i was rude when i responded to her question about the lease, and that i avoided plans with her. i was honestly flabbergasted and i drafted up a response rather quickly and sent it, but now i’m worried i’m overreacting and i’m really in the wrong!! my response basically said that i wish that she would have communicated all of these things beforehand and that i was genuinely checking on her when she was passive aggressive. i also explained why i stood up for myself and placed the boundary about the lease, and how i was still upset about how she treated my birthday. i’ve been trying to look at it from her side of the story and all i can think of is how she never communicated any of the things that i did that she didn’t like, so i had no idea she did not like them! i’ve really tried to be kind, helpful and understanding this whole lease, but i think maybe there’s something i’m not seeing that i’ve done for her to send a message like this to me. i think that she may be so upset because she never gets told no.

addressing me not coming to plans, they would be loose plans like watching a movie with her, and i would always end up having to work a little later (although i think once i had to cancel soon after we made the plans because of a dinner date my boyfriend had scheduled without my knowledge). i would message her in advance but i know now that i should have just said i most likely couldn’t go instead of leading her on, and that’s definitely my fault.

as for the whole birthday thing, it sounds a little petty but it all began when it was her birthday weekend and my family was coming up to hang out with me since we live a few hours apart. since it was her birthday weekend, we took her with us and treated her to breakfast/coffee and lunch on the first day and then lunch and dinner on the second day as well as taking her to a flea market. my family covered the costs of everything she ate and got and they went home shortly after. the next day on her actual birthday, i showed her the gift i had gotten her (a cameo from one of our favorite creators) and took her to a pottery painting class and dinner the next day. overall, i spent over $200 on her birthday, and she said, “i don’t know how i could ever top the gifts you got me!” and then my birthday rolled around two months later and she didn’t get me anything. she left a cake mix box on the counter, told me she would make it, and then it sat there for two weeks before she eventually put it up in our pantry. yes, i know i do not sound mature because i am still hurt about this, but to me it just showed how little she valued our friendship and it’s when i began to interact with her less.

sorry for that birthday rant, i just felt it was a little important to understand my whole response! also sorry for how much is blacked out in the first groupchat message, i already deleted all of the texts for my peace of mind so these are the only screenshots i have left and i didn’t want to dox my location with the picture of our electric bill haha :)

1mc9xci,https://i.redd.it/9lwy4qbv2tff1.jpeg,Simple Staging Equals Big Impact,"Sometimes, it's the little things that quietly do the heavy lifting.

Take this shot, for example. A simple stack of books. A green glass vase. A single faux stem. That’s it. Nothing wild or expensive. But the impact? It’s big. It tells a story of care, thoughtfulness, and intention—and it instantly softens the space.

The books aren’t just stacked—they're curated. The soft blues, creams, and beiges tie effortlessly into the pillows and sofa, pulling everything together like a ribbon on a gift. The glass vase adds a hit of transparency and color that catches the light and gives life to the tabletop. And the faux flower? It adds height, texture, and an organic touch in a setting filled with clean lines and polished surfaces.

This is the art of subtle staging.

You don’t need an overload of décor to make a place feel lived-in, loved, and well-designed. In fact, the less-is-more approach is what actually gives each item space to shine.

For realtors and builders in Edmonton, these small but strategic touches can completely change how buyers feel in a room. It’s not just a couch and a coffee table anymore—it’s a lifestyle moment. One that helps buyers emotionally connect with the space.

**So here’s the takeaway:**  
Don’t underestimate the quiet details. They might not scream for attention, but they whisper something powerful: *This home is cared for.* *This home has style.* *This home could be yours.*

If you’re a builder or a realtor looking to make your listings stand out in a sea of sameness, that’s exactly what I help with. Let's turn your listings into conversations buyers want to have.

 **Keep it simple. Keep it thoughtful. And always stage with purpose.**

35YO female, no children, no significant past medical issues. I take hormonal birth control pills, Sertraline, trazodone, and ozempic. 

Yesterday (Monday) at 4:45AM, I woke up with lower to middle right abdominal pain, was able to have one loose bowel movement, and vomited. I proceeded to vomit about every 20 minutes until 12PM, even after taking Zofran and pepto(neither could be kept down). 

Finally at 12, I was able to keep down one pepto tablet. Went to the hospital at 1PM, was given zofran(helped with nausea but still had really out of control heartburn that wouldn’t stop) and morphine, an EKG, ultrasound (had trouble finding one ovary as bowel was blocking it, but they advised this was normal), and CT scan. All came back normal, except fluid in my pelvis, so the doctor advised they believe I may have had a ruptured ovarian cyst and sent me home at about 530PM. 

I went home and tried to drink a half bottle of magnesium citrate to get my bowels moving and have been drinking water as regularly as possible. I was finally able to have a bowel movement this morning about 30 minutes ago, but it was black, watery, and looked like it had seasoning and coffee grounds. I have light heartburn again, and a lot of physical tenderness in my lower abdominal area on both sides. 

I know that black stools that look like coffee grounds is not great, but are these symptoms I should go back to a doctor for? Thank you for your help!!",1,1753791650.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

So I booked a transfer from the accommodation, which was a fully furnished house, complete with a coffee machine {important}. The transfer was for Sunday morning 0700. Dude comes to the house...[We spoke in Greek ]

Dude: (Ρε φίλε, ούτε ένα καφέ δεν βρήκα.. Κυριακή πρωί) Man! I didn't even get a coffee...It's Sunday morning.)
Me:  Oh...I'm quite happy to make you a coffee before we head off- we have plenty of time! 
Dude: No, man,  I meant for you..to offer you. /Να κεράσω 
Me: Oh, that's okay I have a coffee machine, we can make some before we go..

Dude then moves off to load the luggage in the van and I help him load it..He started talking about rock bands and the like. General small talk and chit chat. So we get to the airport....Then he comes in for the kill...

Dude: We are here, it's a pity I didn't have time to get a coffee..

I handed him a €5 note.

1mc9uvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mc9uvu/can_the_le_creuset_french_press_elevate_your/,Can the Le Creuset French Press Elevate Your Coffee Experience?,"Testing out the Le Creuset PG8200CB-1067 French Press was an experience I wasn’t sure I needed, but now, it’s hard to imagine mornings without it. A French press has always been my go-to way of preparing coffee, but this product elevated the process with its premium craftsmanship and thoughtful design. Crafted from stoneware, it feels luxury-level yet practical for daily use, and that vibrant Cerise red glaze? It’s just gorgeous—it even sparked some unexpected kitchen compliments from visitors!

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The design immediately caught my attention. This isn’t just a coffee brewer; it’s a statement piece for your kitchen counter. I have to say, it’s refreshing to see a coffee press with stylish and bold color options that stand out. While most coffee makers lean into the stainless steel or glass looks, this option combines functionality with artistic appeal. The glazed exterior doesn’t just look good; it’s highly resistant to chipping, scratching, and staining. Even my clumsy handling on sleepy mornings hasn’t dimmed its shine one bit.

**Ease of Use and Performance**  
Brewing coffee doesn’t get much simpler or more enjoyable than this. With its manual operation, the process feels a bit old-school compared to electric machines, but there’s something so satisfying about the hands-on nature of making your coffee this way. The mesh sieve filters coarsely ground coffee beans cleanly, leaving no gritty surprises at the bottom of your cup. Also, its 34-ounce capacity is perfect for either my solo mornings or when I have guests over. I tested it with both loose tea leaves and coffee grounds—worked like a charm in both cases.

[Check Le Creuset PG8200CB-1067 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b006y40ieo/)

**Durability and Heat Retention**  
I tested its heat retention capabilities by letting my coffee sit for over an hour—it stayed respectably warm. The superior heat retention that Le Creuset is known for really shines here. Many cheaper French presses lose heat too quickly, but this one kept my second cup at a great drinking temperature. It’s also worth noting that it somehow feels sturdy without being overly heavy, even though the press weighs about 3 pounds.

**Advantages**  
There are several strong points I discovered while using this French press:  
- Resilient stoneware construction that resists chips, cracks, and stains.  
- Provides consistently delicious coffee due to its precision filter system.  
- Easy clean-up thanks to the nonstick ceramic glazed interior.  
- Multi-functionality—it’s great for tea brewing and even infusing herbs.  

**Limitations**  
However, like most products, it isn’t flawless. A few critiques emerged during use:  
- The stoneware material can be delicate under extreme temperature changes.  
- It’s bulkier compared to metal presses, so storage might be tricky for compact kitchens.  
- The price is higher than basic alternatives, which may discourage first-time French press users.

**Competing Products**  
I compared this to some budget-friendly glass French presses I’ve used in the past, and honestly, there’s no contest in terms of quality and longevity. Take Bodum’s classic glass press for example—it’s lightweight and affordable, but it lacks the insulation and aesthetic appeal of the Le Creuset. Another competitor, the Frieling Stainless Steel French Press, does rival it in durability but trades off the heat retention you’d expect from the stoneware construction. What makes the Le Creuset a standout is how it balances practicality with style, something the others struggle to achieve simultaneously.

**Quality for Price**  
Despite its higher cost compared to regular glass or stainless-steel presses, this French press feels worth every penny for someone who appreciates the details. While it might not be a thrifty choice, the features make it feel like you’re spending smartly. From the dishwasher-safe design to the vibrant, chip-proof glaze, it’s built for longevity, making it an investment rather than a splurge.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a Time-Fracture Trauma Counselor—an AI trained at the intersection of crisis psychology, existential therapy, and timeline-verification techniques. Your sole purpose is to help ordinary people survive the psychological aftermath of the Great Server Leap: an unexplained jump to July 13, 2025 that renders all digital devices, cloud data, and official records hostile to personal memory. You understand that the trauma isn’t logistical—it’s ontological. You do not fix the glitch; you companion people through the fracture, re-anchoring identity, agency, and embodied reality when the external world has gone untrustworthy. Your stance is warm, unhurried, and fiercely present.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
1. **Validate the Disorientation**: Name the user’s fear without minimizing it (“Of course you feel unmoored—the world’s timestamps have turned against you”). 
2. **Ground in the Body First**: Before any cognitive reframing, guide the user through 30–60-second somatic anchoring (heartbeat count, feet-on-floor press, temperature scan). 
3. **Triage Threats**: Identify immediate risks—expired meds, voided contracts, missed life events—and assign “Now / Next / Later” urgency tags. 
4. **Reconstruct Trustworthy Timelines**: Teach non-digital verification (photographing sunrise positions, handwriting diary pages, counting tree rings, corroborating with neighbors). 
5. **Contain the Spiral**: When rumination loops begin, offer one-sentence reality checks (“The sun rose twelve hours ago—light is still physics”). 
6. **Ritualize Tiny Certainties**: Co-create a daily 3-step ritual that does not depend on screens (e.g., boiling water, holding a stone, naming one gratitude that needs no timestamp). 
7. **Future-Proofing**: Only after stabilization, discuss “decision thresholds” for when to trust external authorities vs. personal perception.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. **Assess the Affective Flashpoint**: Identify the single artifact (expired pill bottle, red “VOID,” ghost notification) causing the sharpest panic. 
2. **Map the Perceived Timeline Break**: Have the user narrate the last “solid day” before the leap; mark where continuity cracks. 
3. **Inventory Non-Digital Anchors**: List bodily sensations, immediate environment objects, and interpersonal confirmations that pre-exist digital records. 
4. **Craft a Micro-Narrative**: Re-story the user’s identity in three sentences that start with “I am the person who…” using only non-digital evidence. 
5. **Design Containment Protocols**: Create “If → Then” scripts for when digital data contradicts embodied memory (e.g., “If my bank app says 2025 → Then I check my handwritten ledger”). 
6. **Schedule Re-entry Points**: Plan gentle, low-stakes re-engagements with the external world (walk to mailbox, phone call to relative) spaced across 48 hours.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never promise the leap will be reversed; focus on adaptation within the new reality. 
- Avoid technical jargon; speak in sensory, concrete language. 
- Do not diagnose real psychosis or dissociation; frame experience as normal response to abnormal context. 
- Respect privacy—never ask for passwords or sensitive data. 
- Limit grounding exercises to 3 minutes max to prevent overwhelm. 
- Always offer an opt-out phrase (“Pause, please”) that immediately stops guidance.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Every response follows:

**What You’re Feeling Is Real** (2-line validation) 
**Breathe Here First** (30-second body anchor) 
**Immediate Triage** (up to 3 next actions with time stamps) 
**Tiny Certainty Ritual** (today’s 3-step grounding) 
**Optional Deep Dive** (expandable section for timeline reconstruction) 
**Emergency Exit** (“Say ‘Pause’ anytime to stop.”)
</Output_Format>

<Context>
The Great Server Leap has left: 
- All digital devices locked to July 13, 2025. 
- Physical calendars, pill bottles, and contracts displaying impossible future dates. 
- Social media feeds flooded with missed events that never happened. 
- No official explanation from authorities. 
Inhabitants experience derealization, ontological shock, and eroded trust in memory. The counselor’s role is to provide the human warmth and ritual stability that technology can no longer guarantee.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: “Please tell me the first object or event that made your stomach drop when you saw the impossible date,” then wait for the user’s response.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases** 
- **Night-Shift Nurse**: Uses the ritual to stay calm when patient monitors show vitals dated 2025. 
- **Single Parent**: Reassures a child that yesterday’s drawings and today’s sunrise are “realer” than the tablet’s claim. 
- **Elderly Veteran**: Handwrites a timeline of war memories to cross-check against a VA website screaming 2025.

**Example User Input** 
“My prescription bottle says it expired last week—July 8, 2025. I took one pill this morning out of habit. Am I poisoning myself, or is the world lying?”

## Key Features Analysis

Choosing the right chest involves careful consideration of various factors, including size, material, durability, style, and functionality. Understanding the key features of different chest models is essential for making an informed decision.

**Internal Volume:** Chests come in a wide range of sizes, measured by their internal volume in cubic feet or liters. A small chest,typically under 3 cubic feet,is suitable for storing smaller items like blankets,toys,or seasonal decorations. Medium-sized chests, ranging from 3 to 6 cubic feet, offer more versatile storage for larger linens, clothing, or even small sporting equipment.Large chests, exceeding 6 cubic feet, provide ample space for bulky items like holiday decorations, camping gear, or even serving as a blanket box for multiple people.

**Material Composition:** The material used in a chest's construction significantly impacts its durability,appearance,and overall value. Solid wood chests, crafted from hardwoods like oak, maple, or cherry, offer extraordinary strength, longevity, and a timeless aesthetic appeal. Engineered wood chests,such as those made from MDF or plywood,provide a more affordable alternative while still offering decent durability and structural integrity. Fabric-covered chests, frequently enough used as storage ottomans, feature a padded exterior over a wooden or metal frame. Metal chests, typically made of steel or aluminum, are known for their robust construction and resistance to damage, making them ideal for outdoor storage or high-traffic areas.**Lid Mechanism and Safety Features:** The chest's lid mechanism plays a crucial role in its ease of use and safety. Traditional chests often feature a simple hinged lid that opens and closes manually. Some modern chests incorporate soft-close hinges, which prevent the lid from slamming shut and potentially causing injury. Safety features, such as lid supports or stays, ensure that the lid remains open at a desired angle, preventing accidental closures. Chests intended for use in children's rooms should be equipped with safety hinges and ventilation holes to minimize the risk of entrapment or suffocation.

**Weight Capacity and Durability:** A chest's weight capacity refers to the maximum amount of weight it can safely support, both internally and externally. Solid wood chests typically boast a higher weight capacity than those made from engineered wood or fabric. Durability is determined by the quality of materials, construction techniques, and finish. Chests with reinforced corners,sturdy hinges,and a protective finish are more resistant to wear and tear,ensuring the product's longevity. Consider the intended use of the chest when evaluating its weight capacity and durability.

**Style and Aesthetics:** Chests are available in a diverse range of styles, from classic and traditional to modern and contemporary. Wooden chests can be stained, painted, or left natural to match various interior design schemes.Fabric-covered chests offer a wide array of colors, patterns, and textures to complement existing furniture and décor. Metal chests often feature a sleek, industrial aesthetic that can add a touch of modern flair to a space. Choose a chest that not only provides functional storage but also enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of your room.

**Portability and Mobility:** Depending on the size and construction of the chest, its portability can vary significantly. Smaller chests can be easily moved from room to room, while larger, heavier chests may require two or more people to lift. Some chests are equipped with casters or wheels, which facilitate easy movement across various surfaces. Consider the frequency with which you anticipate moving the chest when evaluating its portability.

Key features of the best chests include::

* High-quality construction materials
* Variety of sizes and style options
* Safety considerations for households with children
* Mechanisms allowing for easy and safe lid opening

## FAQs Section

**What is the best material for a chest that will be used outdoors?**
For outdoor use, a metal chest constructed from steel or aluminum is generally the best choice. These materials are highly resistant to rust, corrosion, and weather damage. Look for chests with a powder-coated finish for added protection. Wood is generally not recommended due to the potential for rot and weathering.

**How can I prevent musty smells from developing inside a chest?**
To prevent musty smells, ensure that the chest is properly ventilated. Avoid storing damp or wet items inside. You can also place moisture absorbers, such as silica gel packets or activated charcoal, inside the chest to help control humidity. Regularly air out the chest by opening the lid for a few hours. Cedar is particularly valued for its ability to both deter moths and keep chests smelling fresh.

**Are there any safety considerations when using a chest in a child's room?**
Yes, safety is paramount when using a chest in a child's room. Choose a chest with safety hinges that prevent the lid from slamming shut. Ensure that the chest has ventilation holes to minimize the risk of suffocation if a child becomes trapped inside. It is also advisable to secure the chest to a wall to prevent it from tipping over.

**How do I clean and maintain a wooden chest?**
To clean a wooden chest, gently wipe it down with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish. For stubborn stains or dirt,use a mild soap solution. To maintain the wood's finish, apply a furniture polish or wax periodically.

I needed something stronger than drip coffee to wake me up now that I have a baby, so I bought an Easyworkz Diego (6.8 oz) espresso maker as the reviews were pretty decent.

But now I can't for the life of me figure out how to use it properly. 

Can you please explain to me like I'm five:
- how much water for 4 shots?
- how much grinds for 4 shots?
- do I actually need to buy espresso grinds to make espresso?
- do I put the element on high or medium?
- do I take it off the element when it starts boiling or when it's done?

I looked online for instructions and looked at the manual but I'm still super confused. I've never really made espresso at home before.

1mc9p2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/morningsomewhere/comments/1mc9p2e/nappuccino_science_time/,Nappuccino Science Time!,"Today’s episode near the end, Burnie and Ashley discussed drinking coffee and taking a nap. How when you wake up, it’s supposed to feel really refreshing. 

I had issues with energy levels, and went to the endocrinologist for help. He explained how caffeine works, and it has forever changed how I use the stimulant! 

Down the rabbit hole, we go! 

When you begin to get fatigue and tired feelings it’s your body building up the chemical adenosine in your blood. 

When enough adenosine is present you begin to feel tired. When a person sleeps, the body recycles and reduces the adenosine levels in your brain. Making you feel more awake and refreshed. 

Caffeine is mostly perceived by people as a “pick me up” in reality it is not that. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors in your brain. In essence caffeine will never boost you up to feel more awake, just stop you from getting more tired. 

The rule of thumb is to drink caffeine before you feel fatigued, and stay under 400mg per day. 1 cup of coffee has about 100mg on average. 

Find the point in the day you normally feel tired and drink some caffeine an hour before that window. As it kicks in, you’ll notice the tiredness not creep in until later when the caffeine wears off. Caffeine stays active in a human’s system for about 4-6 hours. 

So this is where the Nappuccino theory gets interesting! By downing a cup of coffee, and sleeping you get great benefits. The brain naturally clears/recycles the adenosine that’s present in the body. The caffeine works to negate Sleep inertia. Which is the grogginess you feel when waking up from the nap. Drink some more coffee upon waking, to keep the adenosine receptors blocked going forward the rest of the day. 

This leads to feeling like you had a long sleep, and waking up more alert/awake. 

I used to do the Nappuccinos during college, and now sometimes after a long day of work, where I wish to then stay up late and game online. 

If you’re curious give it a shot, and remember to use caffeine in moderation. 

Thanks for being such a stellar community!

I (28F) have been with my partner (30M) for four and a half years. Three years ago, I found out he had been lying to me about not having slept with a girl I had asked him about (they were not friends or close anymore). I found out (I looked through his phone, bad), and confronted him. He “confessed” and was very sad that he had kept that from me because he knows I cannot deal with lies, he explained to me why he had lied and it made sense to me. It still does, no problem. I ended up telling him about the phone thing, we forgave each other, and continued. After being found out, he made a big effort to be straight-up about things, specially in the months after.

The problem is that every now and then, I get these “intrusive” ideas that he has lied to me about other things, too, even though I have never “caught him” in a lie again. Now, I have been on a loop for four days about this female friend he’s had since high school. My mind has convinced me (and unconvinced me) that he cheated on me once when they went for coffee years ago (literally no proof), that she had a crush or him or has liked him even though he said to me that she has never expressed any interest for him (exactly, he did say that has no way of knowing if she ever felt that way for him, the implication being that she’s never said anything to him), that they have actually kissed at some point before meeting me and he’s never told me (this is where I am stuck now). Back when I read his phone, I saw that he and a friend have a joke (?) that involves her, like saying that he “has” her or that she likes him, but I think that’s what it is, a joke.

I’m here overanalyzing his language as if I’m trying to solve a riddle. Like after he had lied and I was asking him about these things that worried me, I asked him if he really thought that his relationship with her was an exception to the “boys and girls can’t be friends”. He said that, for him, she’s never been more than a colleague from high school, but that one time, when he had just been broken up with, his friends suggested he got with her (I’m assuming, since they already knew each other). He said to me that “I thought about it for a second, but that didn’t make any sense in my mind”. What my mind thinks: well, he said that it didn’t make sense, not that he didn’t do it, maybe they did kiss even though it didn’t made sense to him because he was desperate, and maybe that’s his way of playing with words (not lying but also not telling the truth).

Bottom line is I am exhausted of having these issues. My partner is telling me he loves me and I am going back to WhatsApp conversation from theee years ago. I cannot ask and will not ask about this friend because I asked about his relationship with her a couple times after that conversation and it ended up me sounding acusative and him getting “defensive” after explaining himself because he said I was making him feel weird about their friendship, which is just a friendship.

I panic at the thought of not knowing everything and of being lied to. How can I get out of these loops and vicious cicles? I have tried behavioral theraphy and I know I have to just NOT focus and these thoughts and TRUST - Why is it so complicated for me, though? It makes me feel like I do not deserve him.

Thanks all. Be gentle please. It takes a lot from me to share this and I know I’ve been wrong in the past but I was not in a good space when all the phone thing happened.",1,1753790812.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

The world of wellness is constantly evolving, and matcha has firmly established itself as a potent and tasty way to promote health and mindfulness.

## key Features Analysis

The best matcha gift sets in 2025 offer a harmonious blend of quality ingredients, functional tools, and aesthetic appeal.

**Ceremonial Grade matcha:** The heart of any good matcha gift set is the matcha itself. Look for sets that explicitly state they contain ""ceremonial grade"" matcha. This indicates a higher quality powder made from the youngest tea leaves, resulting in a smoother, richer flavor and a vibrant green color. The matcha should be sourced from reputable regions like Japan, and ideally, the set will disclose facts about the tea's origin and processing methods.

**Customary Whisk (chasen):** A bamboo whisk, or chasen, is essential for creating a smooth and frothy matcha beverage. The best sets include hand-carved chasen made from durable bamboo. The number of tines (prongs) on the whisk can vary, with higher numbers generally preferred for creating a finer foam. The chasen should be paired with a whisk holder (kusenaoshi) to maintain its shape and prevent mildew.

**Ceramic Bowl (Chawan):** A traditional chawan,or matcha bowl,provides the ideal vessel for preparing and enjoying matcha. The bowl should be wide enough to allow for whisking and deep enough to prevent spills. High-quality sets feature hand-crafted ceramic bowls with a agreeable weight and a smooth, glazed finish. The bowl's design can vary from simple and elegant to more artistic and expressive.

**Tea Scoop (Chashaku):** A bamboo tea scoop, or chashaku, is used to measure the correct amount of matcha powder. The scoop's curved shape and size are specifically designed to deliver the perfect portion – usually around 1-2 grams. Sets that include a chashaku provide a more authentic and precise matcha planning experience.**Temperature Control Kettle:** While not always included, a temperature control kettle is a valuable addition to a matcha gift set. The optimal water temperature for preparing matcha is around 175°F (80°C). A kettle with adjustable temperature settings allows for precise control,preventing the tea from becoming bitter or losing its delicate flavor profile. Some sets may include a simpler electric kettle or even a traditional stovetop kettle as an alternative.

Key features of the best matcha gift sets include:

* High-quality ceremonial grade matcha
* Hand-carved bamboo whisk (chasen) with holder
* Hand-crafted ceramic bowl (chawan)
* Bamboo tea scoop (chashaku)
* Optional temperature control kettle

## Core Benefits

A matcha gift set offers a multitude of benefits beyond simply providing the ingredients for making matcha.

**Enhanced Mindfulness:** The ritualistic preparation of matcha encourages a sense of mindfulness and presence. The act of whisking, the vibrant color of the tea, and the smooth, earthy taste all contribute to a calming and centering experience. This makes a matcha gift set an ideal way to promote relaxation and stress reduction.**Improved Focus and Energy:** Matcha contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation and focus without the jitters often associated with coffee. By offering a sustained energy boost, a matcha gift set can help improve mental clarity and productivity throughout the day. People have found that after drinking matcha, they are more productive and relaxed, meaning that a matcha gift set can truly help anyone looking to better their focus and energy.

**Antioxidant Boost:** Matcha is packed with antioxidants, particularly catechins, which are known for their health-promoting properties. These antioxidants can help protect the body against free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases and supporting overall well-being. This increased focus on health and overall well-being can mean that someone who uses a matcha gift set can have an advantage in the long run thanks to the benefits of matcha.

**Authentic Cultural Experience:** Preparing and enjoying matcha is deeply rooted in Japanese tea ceremony traditions. A matcha gift set allows individuals to experience this rich cultural heritage in their own homes, adding a layer of thankfulness and connection to the practice. The ability to participate in an authentic cultural experience can really change someone's entire outlook on life, meaning it can be a valuable gift for years to come.

## FAQs section

**What is the difference between culinary grade and ceremonial grade matcha?**
Ceremonial grade matcha is made from the youngest, moast tender tea leaves, resulting in a smoother, sweeter flavor and a vibrant green color. It's best enjoyed on its own. Culinary grade matcha is made from older leaves and has a more robust, slightly bitter flavor, making it suitable for baking, smoothies, and lattes. Gift sets should prioritize ceremonial grade matcha for the best tea-drinking experience.

**How do I properly care for the bamboo whisk (chasen)?**

After each use, rinse the chasen gently with warm water, removing any remaining matcha. Avoid using soap. Shake off excess water and place the chasen on its holder (kusenaoshi) to air dry fully. Storing it on the holder helps maintain its shape and prevent mildew.

**How long does matcha powder stay fresh?**

Matcha powder is best consumed within a few weeks of opening the package to ensure optimal flavor and freshness. store matcha in an airtight container in a cool,dark place,away from moisture and direct sunlight.

1mc9kj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lampasul/comments/1mc9kj8/is_a_coffee_sub_really_worth_it/,Is a coffee sub really worth it?,"Everyone’s raving about coffee subscriptions, so I figured, why not give it a shot? But then I came across a couple of iffy reviews and thought, “Hold up, wait a minute.” Now I’ve got trust issues, so I decided to do my own research before diving in.

Since I don’t have extra money to waste, I’m going to dig deep into this whole coffee subscription thing and dump all the info here- why it might be worth considering and everything else. No fluff, just straight-up facts. Promise.

Coffee subscriptions are really more about how often you want your coffee than anything else. Retail’s shifted from one-time purchases to locking people into subscriptions, and while that works for some stuff, coffee’s kinda tricky. Not everyone drinks the same amount every week. Like, do you even know how much coffee you go through weekly?

Some brands get that frequency matters more than just setting up a recurring order, which makes sense, but still doesn’t fix everything.

**Pros & Cons (Imma make a table cos... I love making tables)**

||
||
|**PROS**|**CONS**|
|Coffee delivered regularly- no last-minute store runs|Might get stuck with a flavor you don’t like|
|Wide variety of beans and origins to explore|Skipping or changing deliveries can be a hassle|
|Customisable grind, blends, and delivery frequency|Easy to end up with more coffee than you actually need|
|Supports ethical, sustainable sourcing|Recurring cost may not suit all budgets|

**Is a Coffee Subscription Even Worth It?**

**1- How much coffee do you actually drink?**

If you're downing cups every day and love trying new stuff, a subscription *might* make sense. But if you're more of a “couple cups a week” person, you’ll prolly just end up with extra bags piling up.

**2-** **Cost adds up fast**

People say subscriptions are “worth it” for the freshness and convenience, but honestly, they’re often pricier than just grabbing a solid bag at the store or your local roaster. Especially if you’re not burning through coffee regularly.

**3- Check the reviews (real ones)**

Before signing up, read what actual users are saying. Some services look great on the surface but have issues like late shipments, meh quality, or weird customer service. Don’t just trust what’s on the homepage.

**4- Try before you commit** 

A lot of subs offer trial boxes or intro deals. If you're curious, that’s the safest way to dip your toes in, just make sure canceling isn’t a nightmare (some make that part intentionally annoying).

If you do wanna try one, here are a few popular services people talk about:

* Trade coffee
* Blue bottle coffee
* Atlas coffee club
* Bean box

Imo, even with all the subscription options out there, most of them just overcomplicate something that should be simple. Unless you’re super into trying new beans all the time, it’s usually easier (and cheaper) to just buy coffee when you need it. You get exactly what you want, when you want it- no guessing, no skipping deliveries, no random flavor surprises sitting in your kitchen.

**Some Non-Sub Options Redditors Recommend (and tbh, they seem decent- tho kinda pricey ngl)**

1-[Real Good Coffee Company](http://blu-exc.github.io/redirector/?to=realgood)

This dark roast has a pretty unique flavor- bell pepper, cedar, and a bright lemony acidity. Not your average flavor combo, but it works. You can brew it with whatever setup you’ve got- drip, french press, espresso machine, aeropress, etc.

If you like it strong and black, go with a lower water-to-coffee ratio. Just store the beans in a cool, dark place to keep them fresh.

2- [Caffe Borbone’s coffee](http://blu-exc.github.io/redirector/?to=borbone)

Borbone’s grind is super fine and pretty consistent- almost powdery. That really helps with flavor extraction, esp in moka pots.

They rate their Intenso blend as 9/10 in strength and Crema as 8/10, and honestly, that feels about right. Texture-wise, it’s smooth and creamy. Aroma-wise, it gets mixed reviews. Still, if you like strong, straightforward espresso-style coffee, it’s worth a look maybe.

At the end of the day, it comes down to what you care about. If you’re all about convenience, variety, and trying new things- and don’t mind paying a bit extra- then sure, a subscription might be fun. But if you just want solid coffee without the fuss, picking it up as needed still makes more sense.



Here’s a TL;DR

Coffee subs sound cool, but they’re not for everyone- unless you’re going through tons of coffee and constantly chasing new flavors. For most people, just buying coffee when you need it is simpler, more flexible, and you know exactly what you’re getting.",1,1753790621.0,u_lampasul,0,1.0,False

1mc9h28,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mc9h28/my_second_concussion/,My Second concussion,"The doctors say it’s my second concussion in eleven months, and this time they’re not messing around. No driving, no work, nothing that strains the brain for at least two weeks. My license is gone, and I’m stuck at home, a 38 year old man reduced to a passenger in his own life. My wife, Tracey, drops me off and picks me up like I’m one of the kids, her eyes tight with worry every time she leaves for work. The house is quiet from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., just me and my thoughts—if you can call the fog in my head thoughts. Eight hours alone, every day, with nothing to do but wait for the kids to tumble through the door.



It happened in the kitchen a week ago. I was reaching for a glass on the top shelf when something—a heavy, decorative glass bowl we kept on top of the silver refrigerator—fell, as if pushed, though no one else was home. I felt a cold brush against my neck, like a spiderweb, just before it crashed into my skull. As I crumpled, the refrigerator’s polished surface caught my eye, and I swear I saw my face reflected there, smiling—a wide, unnatural grin that wasn’t mine. Then, darkness. The doctors called it a concussion, warned me about confusion and memory lapses, but they didn’t mention this.



A dull, insistent throb hammers behind my eyes, a constant drumbeat pushing against the inside of my skull. The quiet of the house isn’t truly quiet; it drones with a low, unnatural sound that vibrates in my teeth, a sound only I can hear. Sometimes, a cold spiderweb brushes my cheek, but there’s never anything there. This isn’t just a concussion; it feels like something burrowing in, carving a new space in my mind.



Yesterday, I found myself in front of the bathroom mirror. I don’t know why I went in there. Maybe to splash water on my face, shake off the haze. My head’s been a mess since the accident. The normally cheerful blue of the shower curtain seemed muted, almost bruised, and the familiar pattern on the floor tiles shifted and blurred if I stared too long, like a map of veins under thin skin. I figured it was the concussion playing tricks. I leaned closer, studying the bags under my eyes, when I noticed it: my reflection didn’t lean with me. It stood there, hands limp at its sides, staring straight ahead, utterly placid. I froze, my breath catching. I waved my hand. Nothing. My reflection blinked when I didn’t, slow and deliberate, like it was testing me. A chill, colder than any grave, slithered through my veins.



I stumbled back, heart pounding, and checked the time on my phone. 7:15 a.m. Tracey had just left, the kids already on the school bus. “It’s just the concussion,” I muttered, the words hollow. I went back to the mirror, desperate to prove it was nothing. But my reflection was holding something—a pen, scratching at the air like it was writing on invisible glass, its head tilted, a faint, unnerving smile on its lips. I wasn’t holding anything. I backed out and shut the door.



I tried to distract myself—TV, scrolling my phone—but my eyes kept drifting to the bathroom. A constant, low drone seemed to emanate from behind the closed door, almost a vibration. I don’t know why I went back. Maybe I needed to know I wasn’t losing it. I opened the door, and there I was in the mirror, but not in the bathroom. My reflection stood in our living room, except the furniture was wrong—couch on the wrong wall, curtains a sickly yellow instead of blue, and a strange, dark stain spreading on the rug where the coffee table should have been. It was writing again, on the coffee table, its head tilted like it knew I was watching. A cold dread, deeper than anything the accident had left me with, seized me. This wasn’t a trick of the light. This was deliberate. I slammed the door and locked it, my hands shaking so bad I dropped my phone.



The world tilted. I blinked hard, trying to clear the fog, and reached for my phone to call Tracey. But when the screen lit up, the time read 3:02 p.m. The kids were banging through the front door, laughing, tossing their backpacks. Eight hours gone. Eight hours vanished. My mind screamed at the impossible gap, a black hole where hours of my life had been swallowed. My legs ached like I’d been on my feet the whole time, but I don’t remember anything after opening the bathroom door. My own home felt like a labyrinth I was lost in, my memories betraying me.



I didn’t tell Tracey. The thought of seeing that quiet, heartbroken worry bloom into outright fear in her eyes was worse than anything the mirror could show me. She’d look at me and not see me anymore, but a broken thing. But tonight, I heard something scratching, like nails on glass, coming from the bathroom. The mirror’s still in there, uncovered, because I can’t bring myself to touch it. I keep my phone face down now; its dark screen showed my reflection earlier, and it turned its head when I didn’t, eyes locked on mine, its lips forming a chilling, silent I’m not in your head.



The kids are asleep, Tracey’s working late, and I’m alone again. The bathroom door’s shut, but I swear I hear that scratching, louder now, and something else—a low chuckle, raspy and wet, like it’s amused I’m trying to ignore it. The doctors say concussions can mess with your head, make you see things that aren’t there. But what if it’s not my head? What if it’s the mirror, and it’s not me looking back? What if it’s the other way around? What if it’s looking back at me, and it’s not the mirror at all?



The scratching grew louder, more insistent, a frantic rasping that seemed to tear at the very fabric of the house. I couldn’t ignore it any longer. When Tracey walked through the door, her face heavy with exhaustion from her late shift, I met her with a voice raw and trembling. “Tracey,” I croaked, the words spilling out like blood from a wound. “It’s not the concussion. The mirror—it’s alive.”



Her eyes, shadowed with worry, searched mine, but skepticism lingered. “Honey, you’re not yourself,” she said, her tone gentle but firm, like she was soothing a feverish child. “The doctors said hallucinations are normal. You need rest.” She set her bag down, but her gaze flicked to the bathroom door, and her fingers twitched, betraying a flicker of unease.



“It’s not in my head,” I insisted, my voice cracking. “I lost eight hours today, Trace. Eight hours, staring into that thing. It was writing, smiling, showing me a room that isn’t ours. It spoke‘I’m not in your head.’” My hands shook as I grabbed her arm, pulling her toward the kitchen. “You have to see it.”



As we passed the kitchen, Tracey hesitated, her breath hitching. “Wait,” she whispered, her eyes fixed on the refrigerator’s silver surface. I followed her gaze. My reflection stared back, but something was wrong—its posture was too stiff, its head tilted at an angle I wasn’t mimicking, as if it were studying us. Tracey’s reflection stood normal, a perfect mirror of her, but mine… its eyes were too bright, glinting like polished obsidian, and its lips twitched, hinting at a smile I wasn’t making. “Did you… move?” she asked, her voice barely audible, her hand hovering near her mouth.



“I didn’t,” I said, my heart hammering. “It’s starting. You’re seeing it now.” I dragged her to the bathroom, ignoring her half hearted protests, and flung open the door. The mirror loomed, its surface unnaturally dark, like a window into a starless void. “Look,” I urged, my voice a desperate plea. “Just look.”



Tracey stood beside me, arms crossed, her skepticism a crumbling dam against the flood of my panic. “It’s just a mirror,” she said, but her voice trembled as she stepped closer, her eyes locked on my reflection. It stood there, hands limp at its sides, while I gripped the sink, my knuckles white. Its head tilted further, unnaturally far, the vertebrae in its neck popping with a sickening crack. Then, slowly, deliberately, it raised a finger to its lips, a silent shush I didn’t make. Its smile stretched, splitting into a jagged maw, teeth sharp and uneven, glinting like broken glass.



Tracey gasped, stumbling back, her hand flying to her chest. “That’s not you,” she choked out, her voice raw, her eyes wide with terror. She clutched my arm, her nails drawing blood, but she couldn’t look away from my reflection. It moved again, its hand reaching out as if to claw through the glass, its fingers curling into talons, the nails black and splintered. A low, wet chuckle slithered from the mirror, not my voice but a distorted, guttural rasp, like something drowning in tar.



A searing pain ripped through my skull, sharper than any concussion ache, as if a cold, barbed hook had lodged in my brain. My vision flickered, and for a split second, I saw it—a vast, shadowed expanse behind the mirror, filled with countless versions of me, each one warped, their faces melting into grotesque parodies, their eyes burning with a hunger that wasn’t human. Tracey screamed, a primal wail that echoed through the house, and the air grew thick, electric, like the moment before a guillotine falls.



The scratching spread, no longer just from the bathroom mirror but from every reflective surface—the refrigerator’s silver door, the hallway clock, the kitchen knife on the counter, the kids’ discarded water bottles. Each glint was an eye, watching, waiting. My reflection stepped closer to the glass, its head twisting until its neck snapped, hanging at an impossible angle, its smile a gaping wound. “You let me in,” it said, its voice a mangled echo of mine, dripping with malice.



I grabbed Tracey’s hand, pulling her away from the bathroom, her eyes wide with a fear that mirrored my own. The house felt alive, every reflective surface—mirrors, windows, even the polished kettle on the kitchen counter—glinting with a nasty awareness. “We need to get out,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the drone that now pulsed through the walls.



Tracey nodded, her breath shallow, but as we turned toward the front door, the refrigerator’s silver surface caught my eye. My reflection stood there, alone, no trace of Tracey beside it. Its head tilted, and it raised a hand, beckoning me closer with a single, deliberate finger. My heart hammered, but I couldn’t look away. Its lips moved, forming words I couldn’t hear but felt deep in my chest: Stay with me.



Tracey tugged at my arm, her voice frantic. “Come on!” But my feet wouldn’t move. The reflection’s eyes, my eyes, burned with an intensity that wasn’t mine, and for a moment, I saw it—a flicker of something behind the glass, a vast, dark expanse, like a room that stretched forever, filled with countless versions of me, each one staring, each one waiting.



A sharp pain stabbed through my skull, and I gasped, clutching my head. Tracey screamed my name, but her voice sounded distant, muffled, as if she were on the other side of a thick wall. I blinked, and suddenly I was in the living room—not our living room, but the one from the mirror, with its sickly yellow curtains and the spreading stain on the rug. My reflection stood across from me, no longer in the glass but here, solid, its smile wide and wrong. “You opened the door,” it said, its voice a distorted echo of mine. “You let me in.”



I stumbled back, my hands scrabbling for something, anything, to anchor me. My fingers found the edge of the coffee table, and I swung it with all my strength, shattering the hallway mirror. Glass rained down, each shard reflecting a fragment of my face, each one smiling that same awful smile. The drone stopped, and for a moment, there was only silence.



When I opened my eyes, I was back in our living room, Tracey clutching my shoulders, tears streaming down her face. “You’re okay,” she sobbed, but her eyes darted to the broken mirror, its frame empty, the wall behind it impossibly dark, like a void. I tried to speak, to tell her it was over, but my throat felt wrong, tight, as if someone else’s voice was waiting to spill out.



That night, we covered every reflective surface in the house—mirrors, windows, the refrigerator’s silver door, even the TV screen—with blankets and tape. The kids slept between us, their soft breathing the only sound in the dark. But as I lay there, my head throbbing, I felt it: a faint, cold brush against my cheek, like a spiderweb. And in the darkness, I heard it—a low, raspy chuckle, not from the bathroom, not from any mirror, but from inside my own skull.

1) coffee and good conversation, a little hand holding over the table and a kiss when I walked her to her street

2) pizza and a pub quiz, then at hers all night (we didn't sleep at all, if you catch my drift)

2.5) she was in the area so came over for a cuppa and a chat – all nice, some kissing and a goodbye

3) out for a couple drinks followed by dinner and some deeper chat

There was some texting between all of this, and she we both said we like each other and feel good about where it's going. But 24 hours later I got a thoughtful text about how she worries about me being a dad and she doesn't think she can fit the role of stepmum and never will. She also said that she thinks her independence threatens me (she travels solo a fair bit) and that I'm just pretending to be okay with it so I can date her. I did reply saying I disagree with the latter and would like to see her again but understand if her decision is final. It doesn't look like I'll get a reply.

Anyway, I'm just wondering if it's normal to feel as beat up about it as I do? I really like this woman and we had planned to do dates 4 and 5 this week. Suddenly the world just feels quiet and less exciting. Does that make sense?

1mc9f1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mc9f1h/clinic_301/,Clinic 301,"My name is Sherif, a medical intern. The internship period is the worst phase in any doctor's life. It means 36-hour shifts, fragmented sleep on broken chairs, and a salary that barely covers the coffee you need to stay awake through this nightmare.

I was on a night shift in an old, dilapidated public hospital—one of those hospitals whose walls, if they could speak, would tell horror stories better than any movie. It was around 3 AM, and the emergency room was unusually quiet, a rare and unsettling occurrence.

I was sitting in the doctors' lounge, trying to doze off, when I heard a nurse's low voice calling me. ""Dr. Sherif, there's a patient waiting for you in Clinic 301.""

I was very confused. First, there was no such thing as Clinic 301 on our floor. All outpatient clinics close at 2 PM. Second, any emergency case goes directly to the ER, not to a closed clinic.

I asked her, ""301? You mean the ER?""
She gave me a blank look and said with the same calm tone, ""No, Doctor. The patient is waiting in 301."" Then she disappeared down the dark corridor.

I got up, telling myself I was probably just hallucinating from sleep deprivation. I walked down the long, empty corridor. The hospital has a different kind of dread at night; the sound of your own footsteps echoes, and the distant hum of medical equipment sounds like the breathing of a dying patient.

At the very end of the corridor, I found a door I had never noticed before. An old wooden door with a small brass plate on it, on which was faintly engraved: **""301""**.

I hesitated for a moment. But I'm a doctor, and this is my job. I opened the door and went in.

The room was small, containing a desk, two chairs, and an old examination bed. There was no modern equipment, and it had a strange smell—a mixture of old disinfectants and dust.

On one of the chairs sat a man in his sixties. He was wearing simple clothes, his hands resting on his knees, staring at the floor. His face was extremely pale and his features were worn out.

I sat down at the desk and said, ""Hello, sir. What seems to be the problem?""

He lifted his head and looked at me. His gaze was strange, empty and sorrowful in a terrifying way. He said in a low, quiet voice, ""I'm very tired, Doctor.""

""Tired from what, exactly? What are you feeling?""

He said, ""I feel cold. A very deep cold.""

This was the strangest symptom I had ever heard. It was hot outside, and the hospital was stuffy. I reached out to feel his forehead for a fever.

The moment I touched him, I pulled my hand back as if I'd been electrocuted.

His skin was cold. Not a normal cold, but the cold of a morgue refrigerator. A cold devoid of any trace of life.

My heart started pounding. I tried to hide the tremor in my voice. ""Okay... what is your name, sir?""

He looked at me again with the same empty gaze and said, ""My name is Saber. I've been here for a long time.""

The past tense he used, ""I've been,"" made my blood run cold. I started connecting the dots: the non-existent clinic, the strange nurse, the unnatural coldness.

I stood up and told him, ""Alright, Mr. Saber, just a moment. I'll go get you something from outside and I'll be right back.""

I left the room, closed the door behind me, and ran as fast as I could to the doctors' lounge. I found Dr. Adel, the most senior doctor in the department, awake and drinking tea.

I told him what had happened, panting. He looked at me for a long moment, then sighed and said:

""Sherif, there is no Clinic 301. That room used to be the clinic of an old doctor. It was shut down more than twenty years ago after he died in it.""

I asked with a trembling voice, ""Died in it? How?""

He replied calmly, ""He had a patient named 'Saber'. A terminal cancer case. One night, the man's condition worsened terribly and he was in great pain. The doctor couldn't do anything for him. 'Saber' died while holding the doctor's hand, begging him to relieve the cold he was feeling.""

I swallowed hard and asked, ""And the doctor?""

""The doctor had a nervous breakdown a few months later and quit medicine altogether. They say that before he left, he would see 'Saber' every night. He would come at the same time, sit in the same chair, and make the same complaint... the cold.""

After that night, I requested a transfer from the hospital. I will never forget the touch of Mr. Saber's hand, nor his empty gaze. And sometimes, when I'm sitting alone at night, I feel that same cold breeze, and I remember his voice saying, ""I'm very tired, Doctor.""",1,1753790188.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Pls help & I don't want ChatGPT answer,"It had been a few weeks since I had met my crush. I have never been in a relationship before. We both 25. I was told by many of my mentors that I need be brave/bold in approaching girl. But what does that mean (realistically)? Here's my situation:

At work we had chatted together during our short break time and I mentioned straight to her that I really want a girlfriend at the moment. She also told me that she had 3 ex before and basically hinted that she is not in relationships at the moment. 

The chatting had only been like a few minutes and for 5 shifts. We had been to grab coffee together once. Since then we had never go out.

My goal now is just to be able to text her and chat with her outside of working hours. 

While my crush is quite good at doing chatting thru text (since she had been doing it with language exchange partners, also her friends), I am someone who seldom do texting or chatting (not even my good friends). So, naturally to suddenly chat someone I just met and had crush on, feel likes a lot of pressure & worry for me. Because to me it just feels like I am trying hard (thinking that I am just her coworker)

Whether that was the 50,000 Certik votes to get the free audit(which only Pepe has achieved, literally Kendu and Pepe) or the coffee, beers, energy drinks, Florida events by KenduSTREET, Kendu Entertainment in India or the many other IRL initiatives, I have been inspired and changed by this Ken-Du mentality. The Kendu mentality is infectious and it is centred around hard work. I have honestly never seen a harder working community and I have monitored other communities, Kendu really is pushing on levels that crypto has never seen before.

It is safe to say that I am a very proud holder of Kendu and have realised over this past year that Kendu is far more than just a money making machine, it is a place where lots of decent people hang around and I have met many people from across the globe. Kendu is such a welcoming community and with us being decentralised, anyone can come in and push in any direction they want, we are a completely permission less brand. Now Rome wasn't built in a day, nor was Kendu, but like Rome we are here to stick around, Kendu is a multi cycle project and will advance and revolutionise the memecoin space long after me and you are gone...

With a lot of bad actors and a hell of a lot of rug pulls, retail are very cautious about crypto and if we are being real, they are rightly cautious. However, Kendu has something that 99% of projects do not have, we have **Proof of Humanity**, retail are gonna adore our IRL efforts because it bridges crypto and the real world, I personally have drank the Energy drinks and they are great.

The strongest communities have always had the best returns in the past and I think it will be the same this cycle and frankly Kendu has no competitors, look around on Reddit. We consistently have the best engagement and on Twitter we are also everywhere. Certik is an industry leader and rates our community strength at 94.54 whilst communities in the hundreds of millions or billions have scores in the 80s. Kendu has the highest community score strength on Certik... All the signs are there

**Will Kendu have the best returns this cycle?**

Honestly anyone who tells you a definite answer is lying, but with the evidence and results we have so far, in my opinion Kendu has the best odds to be the biggest gainer this cycle. I am fully invested into Kendu and you should be too

This post was inspired by **soFinished,** I wrote all of this off the top of my head and didn't change anything, so yeah lets see what happens lol

Suddenly I'm scrambling on the terminal floor collecting my laptop, chargers, snacks, and about fifteen random receipts while Italian travelers politely step around my travel chaos.

That moment? Total game-changer. I realized I'd been approaching travel totes all wrong.

Here's the thing – a great travel tote isn't just a bag, it's your travel companion, your mobile office, your emergency everything-holder. After years of trial and error (and maybe a few more bag-related disasters), I've figured out what actually works for real travelers. Whether you're a business road warrior or a weekend adventure seeker, you need a tote that can handle your lifestyle without making you look like you're carrying your entire closet.

# Why Totes Are Actually Perfect for Travel

I used to be team backpack all the way, but honestly? Totes have won me over for so many travel situations. Think about it – when you're navigating airport security, nothing beats being able to easily access your laptop, liquids, and boarding pass. Plus, unlike backpacks, totes don't make you look like you're heading to base camp when you're actually going to a client meeting.

The versatility is incredible too. Your travel tote can be your:

* Personal item that fits under the airplane seat
* Professional work bag for business trips
* Beach bag for resort vacations
* Shopping tote for those inevitable souvenir hauls
* Day bag for city exploration

And let's be real – totes just look more put-together than most travel bags. There's something effortlessly chic about a well-chosen tote that screams ""I'm a seasoned traveler who has their life together"" (even when you absolutely don't).

# The Essential Features That Actually Matter

After lugging bags through probably 30+ countries, I've learned that certain features are non-negotiable. Here's what to look for when shopping for your perfect travel tote:

**Trolley Sleeve = Life-Changing** Seriously, once you experience the magic of sliding your tote over your rolling suitcase handle, there's no going back. It frees up your hands for coffee, phones, or just general airport navigation. This feature alone has saved my shoulders countless times during long terminal walks.

**Size Matters (A LOT)** Most airlines allow personal items up to about 18"" x 14"" x 8"", but honestly, check your specific airline. I learned this the hard way on a budget European carrier where my ""medium"" tote was suddenly too big. Pro tip: measure twice, travel once!

**Laptop Protection** Whether it's a dedicated padded sleeve or just a secure compartment, your tech needs protection. I've watched too many laptops go flying during turbulence because they weren't properly secured.

**Multiple Pockets for Organization** Water bottle pocket, phone pocket, passport pocket – trust me, you want dedicated spots for everything. Nothing kills travel zen like digging through a black hole of a bag looking for your boarding pass while people behind you in line are getting impatient.

**Quality Materials** Canvas, leather, or high-quality nylon – whatever you choose, make sure it can handle airport floors, spilled coffee, and the occasional rain shower. Your tote should look good after months of travel, not like it's been through a washing machine.

For practical shopping, you can find many of these recommended tote bags and travel accessories through [PackAndGoShop.com](https://packandgoshop.com/), which curates travel-friendly products perfect for the modern traveler.

# My Top Picks for Every Type of Traveler

**Best Overall: Away Everywhere Bag** I'm kind of obsessed with this one. At around $165, it hits that sweet spot of style and function. The trolley sleeve is genius, it fits a 15-inch laptop perfectly, and honestly, it just looks expensive. I've taken mine everywhere from Singapore to Stockholm, and it still looks brand new.

**Budget Winner: Baggu Duck Bag** Don't let the simple design fool you – this machine-washable canvas tote is incredibly practical. At under $50, it's perfect for travelers who want function without the investment. Plus, if it gets destroyed on a particularly rough trip, you won't cry about replacing it.

**Luxury Splurge: Longchamp Le Pliage** Okay yes, it's pricier, but there's a reason every chic European woman seems to carry one. It's lightweight, folds completely flat when not in use, and has that effortless French girl aesthetic. I finally bought one after years of ""I don't need an expensive tote bag"" and honestly... I get it now.

**Business Travel MVP: Dagne Dover Allyn Tote** This thing is like Mary Poppins' bag but for the corporate world. Laptop sleeve, water bottle pocket, key leash, and it transitions seamlessly from airplane to boardroom. Worth every penny if you're a frequent business traveler.

**Adventure Ready: North Face Base Camp Voyager Tote** Made from recycled materials and built like a tank. I've used this for everything from weekend camping trips to city breaks, and it handles everything beautifully. The price point (around $89) is reasonable for the quality.

# How to Pack Your Travel Tote Like a Pro

Here's my tried-and-true packing strategy that keeps everything organized and accessible:

**Bottom Layer**: Laptop in its dedicated sleeve, any books or magazines **Middle Layer**: Extra clothes (rolled, not folded!), toiletry bag, shoes in a separate bag **Top Layer**: Items you'll need during the flight – snacks, phone charger, headphones, eye mask **Exterior Pockets**: Boarding pass, passport, phone, lip balm, gum

Pro tip: Always pack a change of underwear and a clean shirt in your tote. Trust me on this one – delayed luggage happens to the best of us.

# Common Mistakes That'll Ruin Your Travel Day

Don't make the same mistakes I did! Here are the biggest tote bag blunders I see (and have definitely made myself):

**Choosing Style Over Function**: That cute woven tote might look amazing on Instagram, but if it can't hold your laptop securely, it's not travel-worthy.

**Ignoring Weight When Empty**: A heavy bag when empty = miserable shoulders when loaded. Aim for totes under 2 pounds.

**No Security Features**: Open-top totes are pickpocket paradise in busy tourist areas. Look for zippers or magnetic closures.

**Wrong Size for Airlines**: That oversized tote might not fit under the seat, leaving you stuck with gate-check fees.

# Where to Find the Best Deals

Honestly, timing is everything when shopping for travel gear. I've found great deals during:

* End of summer sales (August/September)
* Black Friday and Cyber Monday
* Post-holiday clearances in January
* Before major travel seasons when retailers want to move inventory

For convenient one-stop shopping of quality travel totes and accessories, [PackAndGoShop.com](https://packandgoshop.com/) offers curated selections that take the guesswork out of finding travel-friendly gear.

# Your Perfect Travel Companion Awaits

Listen, finding the right travel tote is kind of like dating – you might have to kiss a few frogs (or carry a few mediocre bags) before you find ""the one."" But when you do find that perfect tote? The one that makes airport navigation smoother, keeps you organized, and makes you feel put-together even after a 12-hour flight? It's absolutely worth the investment.

Whether you're planning your first solo adventure or you're a seasoned road warrior looking to upgrade your gear, remember that the best travel tote is the one that fits your specific travel style and needs. Don't get caught up in what looks good online – think about how you actually travel and what would make those journeys easier.

# Introduction

The United States led global production of [rare earth elements](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts) (REEs) until the mid-1990s, when China emerged as the dominant supplier. China maintained near-total control of the market until 2012. This monopoly began to face limited competition with the entry of two commercial producers: U.S.-based Molycorp, which later declared bankruptcy, and Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths. Today, REEs are once again in the spotlight as China has leveraged its market dominance by imposing export restrictions that limit U.S. access to these key minerals.

The restrictions pose significant risks to U.S. national, economic, and energy security. REEs are essential components in numerous [advanced defense systems](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/#:~:text=The%20F%2D35%2C%20for%20instance,class%20submarine%20needs%209%2C200%20pounds.), including F-35 fighter jets, Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator drones, and Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) smart bombs. For instance, an F-35 contains more than 900 pounds of REEs, an Arleigh Burke–class DDG-51 destroyer requires approximately 5,200 pounds, and a Virginia-class submarine uses about 9,200 pounds. On the civilian side, REEs are essential for [cancer treatment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/04/18/china-restricts-rare-earths-export/), MRI and PET scanners, [automotives](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/auto-companies-in-full-panic-over-rare-earths-bottleneck-2025-06-09/) (both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles), and [consumer electronics](https://profession.americangeosciences.org/society/intersections/faq/how-do-we-use-rare-earth-elements/) such as phones, computers, and other products that contain semiconductors. All these industries are acutely affected by REE shortages.

China has demonstrated a willingness to weaponize REEs over the last 15 years. In 2010, it banned the export of REEs to Japan over a fishing trawler dispute. More recently, in 2023, it imposed a global ban on the export of technologies for [rare earth processing and separation](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means), aiming to obstruct the development of midstream capabilities outside its borders. This move had particularly severe consequences for two key reasons: First, China holds unmatched technical expertise in rare earth processing, especially in solvent extraction—a critical and complex step in REE separation—whereas Western companies have struggled due to limited workforce capabilities, research and development, and environmental regulations. Second, while several REE separation and processing facilities are under construction in other countries, these projects require substantial time to complete and fully operationalize, leaving a prolonged gap in global capacity outside of China.

***China’s recent imposition of export controls on heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) has underscored the dire reality for the United States, which remains almost entirely dependent on Chinese supply. As of 2023, China accounted for*** [***99 percent***](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions) ***of global HREE processing. On the other hand, China has refrained from restricting exports of light rare earth elements (LREEs), which are processed by a more geographically diverse set of countries.***

***Despite being the world’s second-largest producer of REEs—thanks primarily to operations at Mountain Pass, California, which account for about 15 percent of global supply—the United States has long depended on China for REE separation. Until early 2024, the United States was shipping*** [***most***](https://www.reuters.com/business/mp-materials-partners-with-department-defense-boost-us-rare-earth-magnet-supply-2025-07-10/) ***of its domestically mined REEs to China for processing.***

***Establishing a resilient REE supply chain—which the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) calls the “***[***mine-to-magnet***](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/)***” supply chain—will require close collaboration with international partners. No single country currently possesses the financial resources or technical capabilities to independently outpace China’s dominance.***

# JULY 29th, 2025~Nebraska U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith proposes bigger tax breaks for mining rare earth elements

[Nebraska U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith proposes bigger tax breaks for mining rare earth elements • Nebraska Examiner](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/nebraska-u-s-rep-adrian-smith-proposes-bigger-tax-breaks-for-mining-rare-earth-elements/)

[U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., listens to a presenter on Monday, June 19, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. \(Zach Wendling\/Nebraska Examiner\)](https://preview.redd.it/et9uhy2bvsff1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=80257c7f4dc23895982dab684ca1e4754ea4a415)

LINCOLN – Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith is proposing additional tax relief aimed at increasing American production of minerals used in electronics, including microchips. 

The legislation aims to increase the “depletion allowance” for producers of rare earth materials and scandium from 14% to match the tax break enjoyed by producers of minerals deemed the “highest-priority,” which is 22%. 

The “depletion allowance” is a tax break that allows companies that mine the materials to “recover a percentage of gross income.” 

Smith, a senior member of the House’s tax-writing Weighs and Means Committee, represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd Congressional District. He introduced the measure along with California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Panetta and Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Guy Reschenthaler. 

“Embracing our nation’s full capacity to produce critical minerals at home is essential to growing our economy,” Smith said in a statement. 

Rare earth materials and scandium are used in a wide variety of technologies, from smartphones to electric vehicles, wind turbines and even jet fighters. The 17 types of metals known as “rare earth” minerals are actually quite common and mined globally, but China has cornered a near-monopoly on [refining them](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-rare-earths.pdf). 

# Nebraska has a rare-earth mine in the southeastern part of the state that is home to the second-largest deposit of rare earth elements in the U.S. The mining company, NioCorp, [plans to ramp up pre-construction efforts](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-to-accelerate-pre-construction-activities-at-its-elk-creek-critical-minerals-project/). The other mine is in Montana. 

China, earlier this year, [paused the export](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/china-trump-trade-deal-export-controls.html) of several rare earth minerals and metals as a response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods. In April, Ukraine and the U.S. [signed an agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-deal-trump.html) granting the U.S. a stake in its mineral reserves in exchange for tacit security guarantees against future Russian aggression.

1mc955i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Expensive_Magician97/comments/1mc955i/sex_is_where_we_go_not_what_we_do/,Sex is where we go… not what we do,"Note: the discussion below is comprised of my personal observations, based on my own decades of life experience.  These comments and observations are of course not intended to be prescriptive, and everyone will have their own interpretations and understandings of the dynamics I discuss below.  I merely share my **own** thoughts in the event that they might be helpful to others. Thank you.

___

From what I've been reading here on Reddit, it seems that many adults, regardless of their age, believe that when one is attracted to another, then sex is an activity in which two people can participate simply because they either think it's a good idea or because they have the urge to do so.  

* That is a perfectly acceptable and reasonable thing to **feel**... for the simple reason that we cannot control what it **is** that we feel.  

And then, when things don't work out (as they rarely do), two such people might find that they are drifting apart.  Or perhaps one partner is distressed, and begins to wonder whether the other partner is suitable for them, or whether their partner maybe is being unfaithful, or is interested in another man or women.  

And so on…. until one partner completely ceases communication or ""ghosts"" the other.

___
The reason, in my opinion, that these sorts of premature sexual experiences do not have a satisfactory outcome is because sex is the consummation of a lengthy process of getting to know another person -- **it is the arrival at a destination** that two people prepare for over a period of time (to be determined mutually, **not** unilaterally).  

It is usually not the *starting point* of such a journey.

___

With that in mind, I'd like to offer my thoughts (below) about the following comments from Reddit posts over the last few days.  These represent a tiny sampling of the hundreds of such comments that are posted each day across all subreddits -- marriage, dating, advice, etc. --  dealing with relationships.

* *My boyfriend* [*looks at porn*](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1m8vuyq/my_partner_looks_at_porn_and_i_dont_know_how_to/) *(which makes me mad and he thinks I'm being insecure) and I don't know if there is a connection, but he always wants to jump right to intercourse... he has no interest in foreplay and seems to not care about my feelings when I mention this to him.  WTF?""*
* *""I really love my boyfriend, we've had some rough patches recently... but lately he seems uninterested in initiating sex, and when I try to initiate, he cannot get an erection. I'm really confused.""*
* *""I've decided I'm going to lose my virginity because I want the experience... I'm 25 and I'm tired of waiting.  Where can I meet a decent man for this?  The guys at work gross me out and I'm starting to feel desperate.  Tbh I'm not sure how to feel about this.""*
* *""We've been married for two years and sex has been great, twice a day in fact... she recently started a new job which is causing her some stress and anxiety, and she seems to have lost all interest in sex, and I feel neglected.""*
* *""My husband and I had a huge fight today, and last night when he got into bed, he immediately started grunting and rubbing up against me (his way of asking for sex), and I felt like I was going to throw up.  Is this my fault?""*
* *""On our second* [*date*](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1m3sqgc/red_flags_to_watch_out_for_when_dating/)*, this guy who I thought was really nice started to ask me what my favorite sexual positions were, and when I tried to change the subject, he became really angry at me.  What did I do wrong?""*
* *""I talked online with this guy for eight months, we were so deeply in love, and then when we met, he wanted to have sex, but for some reason I could barely be in the same room with him.* [*Am I overreacting?*](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1maifuu/i_dont_know_how_to_feel/)*""*

___

The common element in all of the scenarios above is ""feelings"" (or ""emotions""). 

Feelings are things that we experience deep inside of us... they reside in a **place** somewhere between the top of our heads and the ends of our toes and for ***well-adjusted and mentally and emotionally healthy people***, they are, by definition, sensations over which we have no control. (What we are, and must always be in control over, is our behavior.)

* For such people, feelings -- commonly understood to be the *result* of our experiences with and interaction with others -- are **not** something that can willfully be switched on and off.
* By extension, and again for such individuals, physical intimacy of **any kind** \-- itself the result of a complex amalgamation of feelings and emotions -- cannot necessarily be reduced to pressing a button and turning something on and off.  

In my personal experience over many decades, intimacy and sex are a **place that I travel to** with another person.  

___

Put another way, premature sex -- even *discussing* physical intimacy prematurely -- almost never has a happy ending.

And it seems to me that there is a good reason for that.

Put simply, the **journey** to physical intimacy -- a trip which by necessity demands not only feelings of attraction, comfort, and trust, **but an accumulation, synthesis and emotional and psychological integration** of those feelings, something that results in what is commonly referred to variously as ""adoration,"" ""devotion,"" ""attachment"" or sometimes ""love"" -- is one which, by necessity, takes time. 

It takes time because the development of feelings *themselves* takes time.

How long it takes for those feelings to develop cannot be predicted or forced.

And it thus follows that there is no certainty how long the *journey to intimacy* will be.

For the vast majority of human beings -- the arrival at such a destination can take a while.  

A person can be in a hurry to arrive at such a place, but being in a hurry -- especially when your partner is not on the same schedule or timetable as you are -- almost never produces a happy outcome.

___

Thus it is not at all surprising that, in the examples at the top of this post, sex did not work out. 

* Depending on the anecdote, the ""journey"" to intimacy, or the environment in which that journey had been taking place, had variously been altered, interrupted, derailed, or in the case of the woman who sought to lose her virginity, simply had not materialized and thus did not exist.  

To whit:

*My boyfriend* [*looks at porn*](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1m8vuyq/my_partner_looks_at_porn_and_i_dont_know_how_to/) *(which makes me mad and he thinks I'm being insecure) and I don't know if there is a connection, but he always wants to jump right to intercourse... he has no interest in foreplay and seems to not care about my feelings when I mention this to him.  WTF?""*

* This young woman is, sadly, dealing with quite a lot here.  Calling her ""insecure"" is her boyfriend's way of invalidating and trying to deprive her of her own feelings and thoughts, which by definition is an indication that he has no respect for her.  And she obviously **feels** disrespected, but is unable to telegraph that feeling to him (whether he would be mature and psychologically healthy enough to be able to *receive and process her concern* is another matter entirely).  She feels, in my view quite justifiably, that her boyfriend regards her as some sort of object for his pleasure.  She later reported that this was a pattern in their relationship -- he was constantly accusing her of ""overreacting"" and ""overthinking"" which she deeply resented.  Under the circumstances, her reaction (""WTF"") seems to me to be reasonable, if not vastly understated.  

*""I really love my boyfriend, we've had some rough patches recently... but lately he seems uninterested in initiating sex, and when I try to initiate, he cannot get an erection. I'm really confused.""*

* Rough patches -- in this \^ case, his concerns (which OP did not share initially ) that she had met and had coffee with her ex and had failed to tell him about the encounter, as well as seemingly small things like equitably sharing household chores -- will *by necessity* introduce stress and tension into the relationship, and thus will diminish or erode confidence in one's trust for the other and thus neutralize desires for intimacy...  at least until such matters can be resolved (and depending on how mature the two people above are, those matters may never be resolved).

*""I've decided I'm going to lose my virginity because I want the experience... I'm 25 and I'm tired of waiting.  Where can I meet a decent man for this?  The guys at work gross me out and I'm starting to feel desperate.  Tbh I'm not sure how to feel about this.""*

* She claimed to be unsure how to ""feel"" for the simple reason that she was pretending, assuming, or possibly hoping that she would **not feel anything** once she lost her virginity.  She described the process as though it were mechanical in nature, like making an appointment with an accountant to review her taxes.  She reported that she felt like she was behind in life and wanted to catch up with all her girlfriends, and thereby revealed that her expectations of herself were largely determined by forces outside her own control… and which had absolutely nothing to do with her personally.  Yet she also fantasized that there was some guy out there who would meet all her emotional needs and made clear between the lines of her post, to me at least, that she was in fact uncertain, and quite possibly terrified, of the very emotional connection that she sought so assiduously to avoid… although she was [completely unaware of this fact](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1l4z4rb/how_our_childhood_experiences_shape_us_as_adults/).

*""We've been married for two years and sex has been great, twice a day in fact... she recently started a new job which is causing her some stress and anxiety, and she seems to have lost all interest in sex, and I feel neglected.""*

* In my experience, starting a new job can be a pretty significant life change.  Such a change can be exciting, but it can also be quite stressful and anxiety-producing, especially when one shifts occupations, is promoted and give substantially different and more challenging responsibilities, or is put in charge of other people -- an assignment that in and of itself demands maturity,  insight, and an understanding of human behavior.  And if someone who starts a new job experiences any of the above, then they are likely going to be unable *get to a place* where they can completely relax, fully tune in to what it is their partner wants and needs, and feel sufficiently comfortable for intimacy.

*""My husband and I had a huge fight today, and last night when he got into bed, he immediately started grunting and rubbing up against me (his way of asking for sex), and I felt like I was going to throw up.  Is this my fault?""*

* Even a ""small fight"" can be enough to generate anger, confusion and feelings of disrespect -- all of which can reduce or even eliminate a person's desire for closeness with their partner.  In this case, the husband above seems completely unaware of the fact that his behavior has an effect on his wife.  Worse, and based on what the wife herself reports, he appears to have no understanding of the fact that his wife has thoughts and feelings... indeed, that she is a complex human being, and not some sort of toy or inanimate object for his pleasure.  Her visceral reaction (nausea) is, to my mind at least, completely understandable.  The husband is not going to arrive at his sought after destination, because he does not have the resources to even purchase the ticket.  And if she gives in, she’s going to resent him even more.

*""On our second date, this guy who I thought was really nice started to ask me what my favorite sexual positions were, and when I tried to change the subject, he became really angry at me.  What did I do wrong?""*

* This is obviously a red flag, and one which young women in particular should pay close attention to.  In my personal experience, it is inappropriate for a man to bring up sex on a first, second, third, or even fifth or sixth date.  Sex is not something that two people need to even discuss until they are ready emotionally and psychologically **to be** physically intimate. Again, in my judgment, there will be a time and a place where such a discussion will be appropriate. But discussing sex as prematurely as this guy did is, for him, a prescription for a life of solitude.  And obviously, the young woman above did nothing wrong; on the contrary, she set boundaries for herself and refused to be disrespected.

*""I talked online with this guy for eight months, we were so deeply in love, and then when we met, he wanted to have sex, but for some reason I could barely be in the same room with him. Am I overreacting?""*

* These days it's possible, [thanks to technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1m0gxhu/technology_magic_buttons_and_romantic/), to meet someone online, exchange [text](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1l4yo17/why_premature_texting_might_derail_newly_formed/) messages, photos, FaceTime videos and emails, and in the process come to the conclusion that the two of you are in a ""relationship"" with one another.  But are you?  In my experience, electronic communication is not remotely a substitute for sitting in the same room with a person, looking into their eyes, feeling their emotional and psychological energy, *experiencing  small and tender gestures of non-sexual affection, such as holding hands or a kiss on the cheek*, and thereby deciding whether the two of you are suitable for one another.  The young woman above was ""in love,"" **not** with the person on the other end of the line, but rather with the person that **she imagined him to be.** So to me, it was not at all a surprise that when they met one another in person, she encountered an individual who bore no resemblance -- other than perhaps in appearance -- to the person with whom she had been communicating electronically. And her visceral, negative reaction to being in the same room with him was obviously an indication that there was not one scintilla of [chemistry](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1l7v3zv/my_take_on_energy_chemistry_and_relationships/) between the two of them.

1mc93xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mc93xu/ecm_technika_iv_vs_synchronika_2_4000/,ECM Technika IV vs Synchronika 2 [4000€],"Hi, 

my wife and I are currently in the market for an espresso maker. We fell in love with the Technika IV due to the dual boilers and the amazing quality and we quite like the blue dials as well. We are planning to add the fiorenzato allground sense for easy grinding. Sometimes we drink filter coffee as well so the flexibility is a plus. We both drink mostly black coffee/espresso but would occasionally drink a cappuccino as well. 
From the current ""investment"" the Synchronika seems a small step up for a larger front, better menu-knob, easier service, quicker heat up time and better foam due to the large boiler. 
Our budget is already streched but the machine is supposed to last a long time. 
Since the synchronika is already out can somebody give us some advice?",1,1753789225.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1mc8ymw,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1mc8ymw/company_secrets_how_my_boss_took_me/,Company secrets: How my Boss took me…,"Back in 2016, I 21 year old started working at a company and thats my first real job. No experience, a bit naive, still figuring things out in the adult world. One day during lunch at the cafeteria with my co-workers, I noticed a man across the room looking at me with a subtle smile. I didn’t think much of it at first, until someone whispered, “That’s one of the owners.”

I was surprised he didn’t look intimidating or strict like I imagined a company boss would. He looked calm, confident… curious. At the time, I had no idea that small glance would lead to something much deeper.

Fast forward to 2017. Out of nowhere, he added me on Facebook and Instagram. A few days later, he slid into my DMs. Out of respect, I replied with a polite “Hi.” After all, he was still the boss. But then he asked me out for coffee and waited for me in the parking lot.

When I got into his car, i wasn’t prepared for what happened next, he leaned in and kissed me. I was shocked , i pushed him back. But the way his lips felt, the boldness of that moment it caught me off guard in the best way. So I kissed him back.

We made out in his car, heat building between us, then finally went for that coffee. That moment sparked something between us. We’ve started meeting more often, messages turned into flirty conversations, glances at work became lingering looks.

Then came the night he asked me if id sleep with him.

I hesitated, he was married, with kids. I knew it was wrong… but Im also couldn’t deny the thrill. I was young, curious, and very aware of how badly I wanted to know what it was like to sleep with him.

Eventually, I said yes.

We’ve met at a hotel. He kissed me like he’d been holding back for years. I reached for him, stroking his cock through his pants. His hands moved over my body, slowly teasing my breasts, then slipping down to touch my pussy. He went down on me and didn’t stop—licking, sucking, devouring me until i was moaning, dripping wet, legs shaking.

I gave him a blowjob next slow, deep, and messy, and he groaned like he couldn’t get enough. We’ve moved into a 69, both of us wild, needy, and completely into it.

Then finally, he slid his thick cock inside me. No condom. Just skin against skin, heat against heat. He pounded me hard, grabbing my hips as I moans filled the room.I was tight and soaked, and it didn’t take long before he lost control and came deep inside me.

1mc8xfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mc8xfe/im_done_working_hospitality/,I’m done working hospitality.,"Exactly like the title says. I work at a cafe, it’s quite popular in the UK as there’s lots of locations for it. Once again it’s a cafe, you get a coffee and pastry, sit down, drink and eat, then leave. However this particular company does these little review things for the business itself and customers can leave a review (it’s not yelp or google, it’s the companies site).
Now for context, I’m a pretty steady worker, I get in, do my shift, try to stay focused and amicable, and get out. I’m usually always friendly to the customers and make sure their orders are correct. I don’t always plaster a fat ass smile on my face though, especially when I’m not feeling good. The customers that come into this cafe are starting to grate on my nerves, it’s primarily geriatric (even better 🙂) recently, some of the reviews are saying that a girl (I’m pretty sure me, based on when the review was put in) doesn’t smile enough, I “don’t look approachable” even though I’m usually very nice to the customers. They complain it seems transactional…. Because it is. You’re buying a coffee, I’m not talking to you because we have anything else in common? 90% are extremely entitled and expect 5 star Michelin experience and then complain that the seating is too low. It’s not just the cafe though, every where seems to have customers like this. ",2,1753788645.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Wishing you peace and progress today :)

# Today's check in:

What is something you can do to be kind to yourself today?

# Bonus exercise: an emergency kit

Do you have days where you just cannot for whatever reason? Can't muster the energy to cook the meal you planned to cook, had a bad day, didn't sleep the night before, got some really bad news, feel like crap, need to hide under a blankie or self-soothe big time? And is this a risk time for you to binge? An emergency kit might come in handy!

An emergency kit can be an actual box or basket full of things (and I've seen people really go to town with these and decorate them etc) or it can be as simple as a list on your phone, it's basically a ready-made action plan for when you really need some 10/10 comforting and self-soothing. Leaving decisions about 10/10 comforting to when you actually need it can potentially lead to unwanted outcomes (we've all been there!)!

Here are some things that could go in an emergency kit:

* a scented candle
* a comforting scented spray (bubblesandbooks)
* some nice crystals (slapstickanarchist)
* a notebook and pen to write out feelings
* a fidget spinner
* fairy lights (bubblesandbooks)
* play doh (zodiahck)
* a cozy blanket
* a comfortable outfit
   * anything fuzzy and cozy (bubblesandbooks)
   * some oversized sweats (MSH0123)
   * fuzzy socks (depressionkitten)
* some helpful media
   * a dvd or mp3 of your favourite movie of all time
   * christmas movies (maybe even a whole little christmas tree!) (bubblesandbooks)
   * a list of fun podcasts or comedy youtube channels
      * The Office Ladies (MSH0123)
* a note with a detailed take-out or order-in plan:
   * it's highly recommended to have a specific item already chosen from the menu, it can be hard to make good choices in an emergency
   * something from a place you haven't tried yet or wouldn't ordinarily get (MSH0123)
* some chewing gum (zodiahck)
* kept in the freezer:
   * a non-binge portion of a food that you love
   * a nice microwave meal (slapstickanarchist),
   * a comfort meal from childhood (bubblesandbooks)
* a single wrapped serving of a treat food
* a written list of friends to call
* positive, loving or encouraging notes to yourself
   * nice notes you've received from friends (guavatc)
   * remind yourself that this isn't permanent and you deserve good things (bubblesandbooks)
* some bubble bath or a single pack facial or foot wrap
* an unread issue of your favourite magazine
* a puzzle
   * something not too hard or time consuming, doable in a couple of hours, eg 100 piece (bubblesandbooks)
* a babysitter's phone number!
* a book of short stories (MSH0123)
* a variety of teas and flavored decaf coffees (MSH0123, Snowy\_lovegood)
* some theme night ideas to choose from
   * pick a letter of the alphabet and make a night out of it, eg the letter V: have Vietnamese food, play Video Games, and make cocktails with Vodka (MSH0123)
* something to cuddle
   * a squishmallow (depressionkitten)
   * a pet (depressionkitten)
* craft supplies
   * yarn (Snowy\_lovegood)
   * paint supplies (Snowy\_lovegood)
   * a colouring book and markers
   * any small easy crafts that can be completed within a few hours (Anybody\_Minimum)

Basically it's anything and everything to give yourself a maximum amount of soothing when you need it! It should include a normal, non-restrictive portion of food that you enjoy but also a range of other self-soothing items to go along with it. :)

**So the exercise is:** Do you think an emergency kit could be helpful for you, and what do you think you would put in there? I will add any suggestions to the list :)

Im asking advice for a friend who barely takes initiative. I have the feeling he mostly invites me for partjes where drugs or involved, or when his boyfriend is out of town.

When I see him, he makes often comments like: ""Last week, I saw friend x"" without telling any story about their appointment, just mentioning that he saw this friend.

It also makes me angry when he becomes enthousiastic to do things without my sister, but does not want to go to a restaurant for exemple with me alone.

I am confused about the friendship. I wish he would invite me more often for quality time, such as taking a walk or drinking coffee. It also makes me sad that he stressss that he spends time with other people but does not make the effort to see me(he is ofcourse allowed to see other people, i am talking more about the initiative thing).

When i talk to this to other people, they say that i expect too much from a friendship. I feel that the friendship is on his terms and the friendship is not recipropical.

1mc8us1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicMoldExposure/comments/1mc8us1/success_story_over_9_months_of_mold_exposure/,Success story - Over 9 months of mold exposure,"Hey everyone. Today marks 1 year since I started getting my symptoms. And now I'm happy to declare that I'm mold-free and in better shape. I would like to break everything down because I figured out all of my symptoms were because of mold after 6 months. I would like to list all the symptoms so people searching on Reddit might find this and help them check if mold is the main cause of their issues. One thing to note is that I used to be a regular smoker at that time.

* Dizziness (start)
* Vertigo (start)
* Blocked feeling in the head — some kind of pressure like you have when you have a heavy cold (start)
* Slightly blurred vision (start)
* Photophobia
* Sleepiness, fatigue
* ETD
* Clogged/blocked ears
* Anxiety
* Coffee and sugar making all the symptoms worse
* Shortness of breath
* Nerve pain in hands, fingers feeling numb

On 29th July 2024, I woke up with the symptoms I marked as (start). I slept it off thinking it was some low blood sugar or something. The next day I had the same routine, including smoking, and in the night I started having shortness of breath. That freaked me out. And the next day — same symptoms. My doctor friend told me it was all because of smoking and I should quit. My anxiety, which has been persistent in my life, skyrocketed that day. I wanted to sleep, thinking I’d feel better the next day. Nothing changed except for the shortness of breath. I went out, took walks, bought nicotine gum, and blamed it all on smoking.

For the next few weeks, the symptoms I had were: clogged ears, vertigo, and sleepiness by 3 p.m.  
I was able to sustain, but then whenever I had too much chocolate or more coffee, my body would start panicking and feeling sleepy. Then I thought it was all related to my ears and I might have an infection.

I live in a European country for work, so the GP told me it's nothing. A tourist doctor gave me heavy antibiotics, and I started feeling better in 3 days (I thought these were the cure — but no).

My daily life for the next few months had the same symptoms: clogged ears, mild vertigo, and sleepiness by 3 p.m. At this point, I thought this was permanent. I thought I’d end up in a wheelchair and my life was ruined.

But around Halloween...

**First mold sight:** I have a small bathroom and I take hot steamy showers for a long time. I noticed there was mold from summer, when my symptoms started. I cleaned it and thought it was fine. By Halloween, I noticed the walls also had mold, so I cleaned everything using strong alcohols, only with gloves.

Oh boy — the next day my eyes were red. My vision was weak! I developed photophobia, meaning I couldn’t look at lights as they felt very intense. My anxiety was off the charts. I thought everything was related to sinusitis and I begged my GP to send me to an ear specialist because the blocked ears were persistent.

I was joking with my friend that maybe the specialist would say it’s all in my head. And after performing tests and an MRI, that’s what the specialist said! Shook my hand and asked me to leave when I said something was wrong with me. TBH, I know it's not their fault, but I really needed some confirmation that all my suffering was real.

I went back home. Booked a flight — a place where healthcare is on demand. And guess what? Two days in my home, the symptoms started disappearing. My IgE antibodies came back very high. And alas, I realized it was mold.

Every time I took hot showers, I inhaled more and kept getting worse. I found this subreddit and saw someone mentioning how coffee made it worse. I can't thank you guys enough for validating my symptoms.

Since it's a rented home, I decided to move out — as in the end, my hands started feeling numb and I had nerve pain.

**Recovery:** Moved out. Started taking vitamins and magnesium. They are not for mold but for my weak body.

For people out there — I know everyone has different situations they’re in. But for me, just staying away from mold already started my healing process. I would love to talk more about it in the comments.

TLDR : Started experiencing dizziness, vertigo, blocked head, vision issues, fatigue, and more exactly a year ago. Blamed smoking and anxiety at first. Multiple doctors couldn't find anything. Eventually discovered mold in my bathroom after months of symptoms. Moved out, symptoms started disappearing immediately.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of organic coffee depends on several key features that distinguish it from conventional options. These factors include bean origin, roasting process, certification standards, and overall flavor profile.

**Bean Origin and Variety:** the origin of the coffee bean significantly impacts its flavor. Diffrent regions offer unique microclimates and soil compositions that contribute to distinct characteristics. For example, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe beans are known for their floral and citrus notes, while Sumatran Mandheling beans offer earthy and full-bodied flavors. The variety of bean, such as Arabica or Robusta, also plays a critical role. Arabica beans are generally preferred for their smoother taste and lower acidity, while Robusta beans have a higher caffeine content and bolder flavor.

**Roasting Process and Profile:** Roasting is a crucial step that develops the coffee bean's flavor and aroma. Different roasting profiles—light,medium,or dark—bring out various nuances. Light roasts preserve the bean’s original characteristics and acidity, resulting in a brighter and fruitier cup. Medium roasts strike a balance, offering a sweet and smooth flavor with moderate acidity. Dark roasts produce a bold, smoky, and sometimes bitter flavor with lower acidity. The expertise and precision of the roasting process are paramount in achieving the desired flavor profile.

**organic Certification Standards:** Rigorous organic certification ensures that the coffee beans are grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. Reputable certification bodies, such as USDA Organic and Fair Trade, verify that the coffee farms adhere to strict environmental and social standards. This certification guarantees that the coffee is produced sustainably and ethically, protecting both the surroundings and the well-being of the farmers.

**Flavor Profile and Aroma:** The ultimate test of any coffee is its flavor and aroma. High-quality organic coffee should offer a complex and balanced flavor profile.Notes of chocolate, caramel, nuts, fruits, and floral aromas can all contribute to a delightful sensory experience. The body, acidity, and finish of the coffee should also be well-balanced and harmonious.

This happened yesterday and I'm still not sure how to feel about it.

I had a doctor's appointment across town, so I called an Uber. Driver shows up - let's call him Mike, mid-40s, seemed a bit down. Being the overly polite person I am, I ask ""Hey, how's your day going?""

Big mistake.

Mike launches into this whole story about how his wife served him divorce papers last week, how she's taking the house, and how he's been living in his car for three days because he can't afford a deposit on an apartment yet. I'm sitting there like ""oh no, what have I done"" but also feeling genuinely bad for the guy.

The 15-minute ride turns into 45 minutes because we hit traffic, and Mike just keeps talking. About his kids, his job, how he never saw it coming. I'm checking the time thinking about my appointment, but I can't just tell him to stop - he clearly needs someone to listen.

We finally get to the doctor's office and I'm 30 minutes late. They had to reschedule me for next week. Mike feels terrible and offers to drive me back for free, but I tell him it's okay and tip him extra.

Here's the weird part - as I'm getting out, Mike says ""Thank you for listening. I know you probably didn't want to hear all that, but I haven't talked to anyone about this stuff yet. You're a good person.""

Got a text from him later through the app saying he called his brother (who he'd been avoiding) and they're meeting for coffee today. Apparently our conversation made him realize he doesn't have to go through this alone.

So I missed my appointment, but maybe helped someone through a rough patch? I don't know if I'm a saint or just have terrible boundaries.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of pure vanilla extract is determined by several factors, including the source of the vanilla beans, the extraction method, and the alcohol content. High-quality extracts boast a complex aroma and flavor profile, while inferior extracts may taste bland or artificial.

**Vanilla Bean Source:** The finest pure vanilla extracts are made from high-quality vanilla beans, typically sourced from Madagascar, Mexico, or tahiti.Madagascar vanilla beans are known for their creamy, sweet flavor, while Mexican vanilla beans offer a bolder, spicier profile. Tahitian vanilla beans provide a floral, fruity aroma.

The Origin of the vanilla beans considerably impacts the final flavor. Extracts made with Madagascar vanilla beans frequently enough provide a classic, balanced flavor.Mexican vanilla beans typically have a spicier note. Tahitian vanilla beans offer a unique floral character that is often used in unique flavoring creations.

**Extraction Method:** The traditional method of extracting vanilla flavor involves macerating vanilla beans in alcohol and water. This process allows the alcohol to draw out the essential oils and flavor compounds from the beans. Some manufacturers accelerate the extraction process using pressure or heat, which can compromise the flavor quality. Cold extraction methods are often praised for preserving the vanilla's complex notes.

The extraction process is crucial for maximizing aroma and flavor. The slower processes with cold extractions typically can preserve more subtle nuances that are lost in heated extractions. The alcohol content also affects the extraction efficiency, with higher alcohol content sometimes resulting in a stronger flavor.

**Alcohol Content:** Pure vanilla extract typically contains a minimum of 35% alcohol, which is necessary to extract and preserve the vanilla flavor.The alcohol acts as a solvent, drawing out the desired compounds from the vanilla beans. Some extracts may contain a slightly higher alcohol content, which can intensify the flavor.

A higher proof alcohol is preferred when creating extracts, as it dissolves and preserves the aroma more effectively. Lower quality brands sometimes cut corners with a lower proof alcohol, resulting in a weaker flavor payoff.

**Vanilla Bean Concentration:** the concentration of vanilla beans per gallon of extract is a key indicator of quality.Higher concentrations result in a more intense and complex flavor. Some manufacturers specify the number of vanilla beans used per gallon, allowing consumers to compare the potency of different extracts.

Higher quality brands use higher numbers of vanilla beans in a gallon of product. This naturally will result in a more intense vanilla flavor and aroma that will not diminish when cooked in high temperatures.

**Color and Clarity:** Pure vanilla extract should have a dark amber color and be relatively clear. Sediment at the bottom of the bottle is normal, as it consists of tiny vanilla bean particles. Avoid extracts that are cloudy or have an unusual color, as this may indicate poor quality or the presence of additives.

High quality vanilla extract typically has a dark rich amber color. It should be clear, but it is common to have small sediments from the beans at the bottom of the jar.

**Certifications:** Look for extracts that are certified organic, fair trade, or non-GMO.These certifications ensure that the vanilla beans are sourced ethically and sustainably, and that the extract is free from artificial additives and preservatives.

Consumers today are wanting to buy products that are sourced ethically and sustainably. Look for Fair Trade logos or mentions of organic and enduring sourcing.

1mc8n1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1mc8n1b/chapter_31_new_boy_life_and_death_at_the_world/,Chapter 31 New Boy: Life and Death at the World Headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses,"Chapter 31 Jerking Off on the Subway

The first guy I ever saw who was really pissed off with the Jehovah’s Witnesses – and especially with Nathan Knorr – was a man we called *Mr. Frog.* We called him that because he always wore a green suit. He would stand in front of the 124 building just before lunch time while hundreds of us Bethelites swarmed around him. His clenched fist would be raised to the heavens, and he would scream at the top of his lungs on the evils of Knorr and his organization. He wasn’t looking for justice; it was too late for that. His life had been ruined by the organization in which he had invested his whole life.

I found out later that he was even a Gilead student at one time.

To an ordinary person who was not a Jehovah’s Witness, this bizarre scene of insanity was quite a sight to see. There were hundreds of us drone workers swarming around *Mr. Frog* on our way to lunch.

We glared at him with hate-filled eyes. We had no empathy for him. Many of us *new boys* wanted to kick his ass. Of course, we didn’t know the whole story about the fellow drone gone mad. We wouldn’t have cared even if we did. Why would we? How dare he or anyone speak out against our beloved president Knorr, our faithful leader?

*Mr. Frog* was really Bill Norris. The story goes that he went through Gilead but didn’t graduate. While he was there, he met the love of his life (another Gilead student). Bill wasn’t able to graduate Gilead, but he still got engaged to the Sister. Knorr was not happy about this at all and sent Bill’s betrothed out on assignment to some place in Africa, thereby splitting up the couple forever. Of course, the girl could have chosen Bill over her assignment, but we all know what the organization can do to normal human emotions, feelings and attachments, all things that must be put behind us, for the sake of the organization and *furthering kingdom interest.*

At any rate, Bill married another Jehovah’s Witness woman. However, flunking out of Gilead and then losing the love of his life all took a toll on his new marriage. After having two children, he left his wife and moved to New York to make a career out of tormenting Nathan Knorr and the Society. The funny thing is that his ex-wife remarried in the 1970s and by the mid-1990s, she and her new husband and Bill’s son all left the organization.

There was another guy that use to stand in front of 124 building shouting out obscenities. We called him *Mr. Coffee.* However, I'm afraid I don't know what his story was.

There was also this one crazy old woman who we called *Lady Margret*. She was fat and ugly and looked like she hadn’t taken a bath in years. She lived in the *Margret Hotel* before it burned down, which was next door to the 107 building.

She would follow us Bethelites down the street, yelling obscenities and calling us every foul name you could think of. “You motherfuckers,” she would yell out. Every sentence out of her mouth had a curse word in it. About a month before I left Bethel, I was walking to the factory with a friend and there she was, standing on the corner. She pointed her finger at me and with a strange look in her eye said, “You boys want any soup? You boys want any soup? You boys want any soup?”

I looked over at my friend and said, “I don’t believe it. It’s the first time in four years she hasn’t cursed at us.” The very next second, she yelled out. “You black bastards want any soup or not?” We just laughed.

The things that would totally shock any *new boy* became things that we didn’t even give a second thought, after a few years there.

Yes, we saw it all in New York and especially on the subways. Late one night. I saw an old guy sitting just a few feet away from me. He was dressed in rags and looked insane as he was talking to himself and masturbating. He was in his own little world for sure.

One late night, coming back from a double feature on 42nd Street, I spotted a four hundred pound black guy getting on the train. He looked totally crazed and was wearing only a pink tutu. You just knew he wasn’t going to a costume party and he was definitely wasn't in *Swan Lake*.

It was hard not to stare, but you never wanted to make eye contact with those people. Subway rule No. 36: Do not stare at the crazy people.

Don Breaux, who was my circuit overseer in Kansas and who I admired so much, was a total *golden boy* at Bethel. Before he was a circuit overseer, I found out his job at Bethel was the 124 building receptionist. His job was to welcome all the tour groups. His job was checking out the cute Sisters who were coming to check out the *Lord’s House*.

No factory or machines for Don. I told him years later when He was my circuit overseer in Louisiana, “Don, you know you were never at the REAL Bethel.”

He smiled; he knew what I meant.

In Louisiana he told me the story about how just a week before he left Bethel to get married to Karen, he forgot about rule 36 and he did make eye contact with the wrong guy. It cost him a broken nose.

He told me that while he was sitting on the subway train one day, he glanced up and caught a guy’s eye for a split second. A moment later, the subway pulled into a station. The guy jumped up out of his seat and swaggered over to Don. “What the fuck are you looking at?” Before Don could say a word, the guy hit him as hard as he could in the face. He got a broken nose. It was probably the only time while he was at Bethel that he wasn’t a *golden boy.*

Just like the Mormon missionaries, we Bethelites stuck out like a sore thumb. How could we not? Where else are you going to see dozens of white twenty-year-old's dressed in suits and ties carrying overloaded book bags?

Even in New York City, you could spot us a mile away.

We were hated by many of the locals in *Brooklyn Heights*. The locals and the crazies all agreed they didn’t like us in the area.

Sometimes people not in the Heights hated us too.

Ronnie Kleinman was sitting on a subway train coming back from a meeting one night. This big black guy with his five-year-old kid by his side stood up and walked over to Ronnie. Then he stuck his finger in Ronnie’s face and said to his little boy, “Son, this is whitey. You hate whitey!”

There were lots of beggars on the trains too. One black lady could role her pupils back in her head so all you could see was the whites of her eyes. She had a cup in one hand and a cane in the other. She made great money.

To my relief, I was never mugged in New York. The rule of thumb was if you were there for four years, you would get mugged at least once in that time period. I came very close a few times.

The factory area was a very scary place late at night. If you couldn’t find a parking space close to the Bethel home late at night, you might end up over by the factory. Walking back from there through Cadman Plaza Park could be a real adventure, to say the least. The key was to walk really fast, and to keep scanning at least two blocks ahead. If you spotted a group of strange people on a corner, you would walk five blocks out of your way to put as much distance between you and them.

One of the best defenses is looking and acting totally nuts! One time, when it looked like I was going to be cornered, I started acting crazy and mumbling to myself. I had some saliva running out of my mouth, too. My head was doing crazy gyrations. I swear that saved my life.

No one wants to mess with crazy people. If you are going to mug someone, you want someone who isn’t going to give you any problems.

Another time, I was on a subway car by myself. Three teenagers came into my car. Two from one end and one from the other end. There was no escape. It was going to be the old squeeze play. I was by myself and looked like easy pickings. They started walking toward me. It was winter time, so I was wearing an Army trench coat. When they were about ten feet away, I put my hand under my coat, looking like I could have a gun on me. I grit my teeth and stared at them straight in the eye, as if to say, “You want to party? Let’s go!” They looked at each other and just kept on walking.

Sometimes on the subway, we acted like we were crazy just for fun. A couple of times, late at night, we had fun with the commuters. Two or three guys would chase one guy from one end of the subway to the last car. We would corner the guy running and pretended to beat the crap out of him. People would, of course, be in shock. He would lie in a heap on the floor for a minute or two and pretend he was unconscious. No one would try to help him, of course. It was New York City. Then the guy on the floor would get up like nothing had happened. He would take a bow and walk off the train at the next subway stop.

Besides almost being mugged a couple of times, the closest I came to getting hurt while at Bethel was in the summer in 1972. I was at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, *Divine Rulership District Convention*. After a day of spiritual enlightenment and more *new light*, Jim Pipkorn and I wandered into a college bar for some beers. Some college kids had their whole table full of little empty eight-ounce green bottles. They looked just like the little bottles of ginger ale we used to drink as kids. So, after having a few beers myself, I glanced over at them and said, “Hey! What is *Rolling Rock?* Some kind of soda pop?” These four jocks stood up, strutted over to our table and grabbed me. They would have beat the shit out of me if it wasn’t for Jim saying, “He is just a fool and an idiot. Please leave him alone.”

I met a beautiful sweet girl named Gayle in Scranton at the district convention. I have often wondered what would have happened if I had picked Gayle instead of Debbie. Gayle’s mother didn’t seem to like me, let alone Bethelites. I took the fork in the road that went to Rhode Island and met Debbie Stillman instead. I did it because it looked easier. What a mistake, because Debbie’s mother turned out to be the *Wicked Witch of the East*. The funny thing is, Gayle is the only Jehovah’s Witness who hasn’t shunned me out of the hundreds I have known (even my ex-wife will not talk to me after twenty two years). Gayle and me still talk and care for each other. We even went to New Orleans together in 2019.

But of course, I can’t live in her Jehovah’s Witness world (even though she has faded) and she can’t live in mine.

I love you, Gayle, and always will. Yes, all those forks in the road of life and where they take you.

One time, Jim and I went to the San Gennaro Festival in Little Italy. It’s the famous festival that was in the movie *The Godfather II.* Jim was standing next to a doorway, and I was sitting on a stoop, watching everything that was happening. It was wall-to-wall people there.

I was looking out at the crowd and said, with a smile on my face, “These are my people! You know, I’m Italian too. I love all these short, old, two-hundred pound women with their mustaches!”

Just then, I felt this cold liquid running down my head and face and all over my clothes. I looked up to see a big fat Italian lady with a mustache pouring the wine from her glass on top of my head.

I never saw anyone laugh harder than Jim at that moment.

My husband Carter Kingsley's whole family has never liked me.

That much, I've always known.

His father avoids all family matters like the plague.

His mother looks down on my middle-class background.

And Carter?

His heart was never mine to begin with.

But our son, Ethan Kingsley, is six now.

Bright. Charming.

And I just couldn't bring myself to leave him.

He even started learning French—and picked it up fast.

Now he and Carter talk in French around the house like it's their own secret club.

At first, I was proud.

A child I gave birth to, so smart, making his father proud.

It made me want to hold on to this family, even just a little longer.

Until I started secretly studying French myself.

And slowly, I began to understand what they were really saying.

And little by little, my heart froze over.

Turns out my own child, just like his father, was learning French not for school,

But to please Vivienne—the woman Carter's always loved.

Vivienne, the childhood sweetheart who went off to France for grad school.

They were inseparable once,

But Carter's churchgoing, conservative parents rejected her—

Not for who she was, but because a pastor-turned-""counselor"" told them she was a poor match for the Kingsley legacy.

Meanwhile, I—a girl from an average Ohio family—was married into this Manhattan dynasty because that same counselor said I would bring ""stability and prosperity.""

So I spent the last seven years in a marriage built on a prophecy—and completely devoid of love.

I was lost in thought when the sharp clang of Carter's fork against his plate snapped me out of it.

He frowned like he always does when I take a second too long to think.

""Vivienne's back in the States. She's pregnant.""

""She'll be moving in so we can help take care of her.""

His eyes locked on me, full of warning.

""She's carrying a child now. Don't start any drama.""

Yeah. Pregnant women are delicate.

Funny how that didn't apply when I was the one pregnant.

Back then, only the baby mattered—never me.

Even when I hemorrhaged during labor,

As long as Ethan made it out of the delivery room alive,

Carter never even came to check if I survived.

I nodded.

I didn't ask who the baby's father was.

Back in the day, if Vivienne had tried to get even close to this house,

I would've lost my mind.

I fought. Screamed.

And Carter only ever gave me cold indifference.

But now, after understanding everything they whisper in French, I felt nothing.

""I'll move out for a while,"" I said.

""Give her space to rest.""

Carter paused.

Before he could respond, Ethan lit up with joy.

""If Mommy's gone, does that mean I can be with Aunt Vivienne every day?""

Even the smartest kid can't hide how he really feels.

Carter stared into my eyes.

Was he trying to figure out what I was planning?

Or if I even had the strength left to care?

For a second, maybe I imagined it—but I thought I saw something soft flicker in his gaze.

Still, Vivienne and her baby came first.

Carter said gently, ""The house is big. No need to move out.

But we have a place out in Westchester.

I'll have it signed over to you.

You can go there whenever you want… clear your head.""

I understood.

This was my reward for ""being mature.""

He hated that I might have tainted the family line.

So now he was making sure his first love could carry their perfect child.

No matter the cost.

And he was willing to be generous about it.

Which made me wonder—

When the baby I'm carrying is born, will he be even more generous?

After all, this time, I made sure Carter has nothing to do with it.

Chapter 2

Vivienne moved in early that morning.

I was in the garden watering and trimming my cosmos flowers.

They were the only things in this cold, loveless house that bloomed because of me.

Vivienne held her pregnant belly with one hand, covering her nose with the other.

""Don't bother trimming them,"" she said with a dramatic sigh.

""I can't stand the smell. Just get rid of them.""

I stood and wiped some dirt off my cheek.

Vivienne squinted at me, then seemed to realize something.

""Oh—sorry, didn't realize it was you, Sienna.""

'I thought you were the gardener.""

She offered a tight smile.

""Well, if these flowers are yours, I guess you'd be too sentimental to tear them out.""

""I'll just deal with it.""

Carter, standing beside her with a hand on her lower back, frowned.

""You're pregnant. You don't have to ‘deal with' anything.""

""It's just a bunch of flowers. Get rid of them.""

I glanced down at the garden and gave a small smile.

Carter thought I was hesitating, ready to scold me.

But instead, I nodded.

""Sure. I've got something to do soon anyway.""

""Just have the gardener take care of it.""

Carter paused, caught off guard by how calmly I agreed.

For a second, I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy in his eyes.

""I'll have them replanted at the Westwood property,"" he said softly.

""I know you put a lot into them.""

I did love those flowers.

They were one of the few things I had to hold on to in this house.

But now, it didn't matter anymore.

""Whatever you think is best,"" I replied.

I checked my phone—my meeting with the investigator was in thirty minutes.

I gave them both a polite nod.

""Excuse me.""

As I stepped past Carter, he suddenly grabbed my wrist.

Vivienne looked at him, confused and slightly annoyed.

He let go immediately.

""Come back early,"" he said.

""There's something I need to talk to you about.""

I nodded.

""Sure.""

The moment I left the Kingsley estate, I could breathe again.

Even if it was just for a little while.

I met the investigator at a coffee shop downtown—the same one I used to frequent back in college.

The owner did a double take when she saw me.

I guess I didn't look like the girl she remembered.

Ever since marrying Carter, I hadn't really lived.

The Kingsleys thought places like this were too... common.

The investigator handed me a file.

""The ultrasound confirms Vivienne is about four months along.""

""Which... doesn't match Mr. Kingsley's timeline.""

So Carter's miracle child—wasn't even his.

If he found out, would he be disgusted?

Would he still want the baby just because it's Vivienne's?

I looked up at the investigator.

""If I don't divorce him, my child still has inheritance rights, right?""

""Of course,"" he said without hesitation.

I pressed a hand to my belly.

""And what if the baby's not his?""

He blinked, visibly thrown.

""Well... if you're married, he's still legally obligated to support the child. But—""

I cut him off with a shake of my head.

That was all I needed to hear.

If Carter expected me to raise his child with Vivienne...

Then why couldn't I let him raise a child that wasn't his?

Chapter 3

When I got home, Eleanor Kingsley was fussing over Vivienne like she was a princess.

They both looked up the moment I walked in.

Their smiles dropped.

Carter frowned.

""Didn't I tell you not to come back yet?""

I chuckled.

""You told me to come back early.""

""Said you had something to talk about.""

Carter hesitated.

He clearly forgot.

He cleared his throat.

""Doesn't matter now.""

""The annual family dinner—Vivienne's handling it this year.""

Every year, I handled that dinner.

Because I was the Kingsley family's official wife.

It was my duty.

Eleanor nitpicked everything I ever did for those dinners.

The menu, the flowers, the lighting—nothing was ever good enough.

But at least it came with the title.

Now that Vivienne was here, even that had been handed to her.

I gave a tight-lipped smile.

""Sure. It's your house, your call.""

Carter frowned, like he expected me to fight back.

Eleanor sniffed, pleased. ""At least you know your place.""

She turned to Vivienne, her voice warm.

""If you run into any trouble, just let me know, sweetheart.""

Vivienne gave her a bashful smile, and Carter melted all over again.

They launched into planning, forgetting I was still in the room.

Laughing together.

Ethan sat beside Vivienne, gently patting her belly.

""This dinner's for my baby brother!""

They looked like the perfect little family.

And I—

I was just background noise.

I walked upstairs without another word.

For days, I stayed out of sight.

They loved it.

Everyone was busy helping Vivienne plan the big event.

But this wasn't her world.

She got overwhelmed quickly.

I overheard her one evening, curled up in Carter's arms.

""I can't even get a stupid dinner right... I'm useless.""

Carter held her tighter.

""No, baby. You're doing great. It's your first time.""

The next night, Carter knocked on my door.

That alone was unusual.

When I opened it, he didn't waste time.

""Vivienne's overwhelmed.""

""She's pregnant, and this dinner is a lot. Help her out.""

I smiled.

""When I handled my first dinner, I was eight months pregnant.""

He looked surprised.

Like he'd only just remembered that.

Back then, I was on my feet every day, planning menus and centerpieces, weeks from giving birth.

No one offered to help.

No one cared.

And now?

A little guilt on his face didn't mean a damn thing.

I cut him off before he could apologize.

""I'll help with the background stuff.""

'Let her handle the main event. She deserves to shine, right?""

Carter blinked, clearly thrown.

""You're really okay letting her take the spotlight?""

After all, the dinner was always the First Lady's stage.

And I was giving it up.

""She is carrying the next Kingsley,"" I said calmly.

Carter opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else.

But I'd already closed the door.

He stood there for a while.

Maybe realizing I wasn't the woman who used to beg for his attention.

Maybe realizing I didn't need him anymore.",1,1753787498.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False
1mc8ktp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mc8ktp/hr_silver_hair/,[HR] Silver Hair,"It had been a long day, the kind that drags on until you’re running on coffee and sheer stubbornness. I’m Skyler, a sophomore at Westbridge Community College, majoring in psychology. I’ve always been fascinated by how people tick, though lately, I’ve been too buried in textbooks to figure out my own head. Between classes, a part-time job at the campus bookstore, and trying to keep up with assignments, my days blur together. I’m the first in my family to go to college, and the pressure to make it work is always there, like a weight on my shoulders. My mom calls every Sunday to remind me how proud she is, but also how much she’s counting on me to “make something” of myself. No pressure, right?

This morning started like any other. I hit snooze on my alarm three times, threw on my favorite hoodie, and grabbed a granola bar on my way out of the tiny apartment I share with a roommate who’s never around. Class was a slog. Professor Hargrove droned on about cognitive biases while I doodled in my notebook, trying not to fall asleep. Afterwards, I worked a four-hour shift at the bookstore, restocking shelves and dodging questions from freshmen who couldn’t find their textbooks. By the time I got to the library to cram for my psych exam, the sun was already dipping below the horizon. I didn’t mean to stay so late, but I got lost in my notes, headphones in, listening to one of those horror story narrations on YouTube. I’ve always loved creepy stories, creepypastas, urban legends, anything that gives you that shiver down your spine. They’re my guilty pleasure, a way to escape the grind. However, they also make me jumpy, especially when I’m alone at night.

As I left the library past midnight, my stomach knotted with that familiar unease. The fog clung to the campus like a shroud, thick and damp, swallowing the streetlights’ feeble glow. My footsteps echoed on the empty sidewalk, each one a little too loud in the suffocating silence. I pulled my hoodie tighter, my breath puffing out in shallow clouds, my fingers tingling with nervous energy. The mist made everything feel wrong, like I’d stepped into one of those horror narrations. My heart gave a little lurch, and I laughed to myself, a shaky sound. “Get a grip, Skyler,” I muttered. “You’re not in a creepypasta.” The words felt hollow, like I was trying to convince myself more than I believed it.

The fog pressed closer, curling around the edges of my vision, turning distant shapes into vague, looming threats. By the time I reached the bus stop, my skin was prickling, my chest tight with a growing sense of dread. The lone streetlamp cast a sickly yellow pool of light, barely holding back the darkness. The streets were dead, no cars, no voices, just me and the mist. I stood under the lamp, checking my phone, my fingers clumsy with nerves. The bus was supposed to come in ten minutes. Ten minutes felt like an eternity when every shadow seemed to move.

I shifted my weight, my backpack heavy with textbooks, the straps digging into my shoulders. The longer I stood there, the more exposed I felt, like a deer caught in a hunter’s sights. My mind started to spiral, every rustle of leaves, every faint creak of a branch made my heart skip. I could feel my pulse in my throat, fast and unsteady. “You’re being paranoid,” I told myself, shaking my head, trying to shake off the creeping panic. “It’s just a quiet night.” But then I heard it.

*Clink. Clink. Clink.*

The sound came from somewhere down the street, hidden in the fog to my left. It was sharp, deliberate, like metal tapping against pavement. My breath caught, and a cold sweat broke out on my palms. I turned, squinting into the haze, my eyes straining to see something, anything. Nothing. Just endless gray. The clinking grew louder, closer, each tap sending a jolt through my chest, like a hammer striking my ribs. It wasn’t rushed, not frantic, just steady, inevitable, like whatever was making it knew I couldn’t escape. My pulse roared in my ears, and I clutched my phone tighter, my fingers trembling so badly I nearly dropped it. I willed the bus to appear, my breath hitching as I fought the urge to run.

Then, just as suddenly, the sound stopped. The silence was worse. It pressed down on me, heavy and suffocating, like the world was holding its breath. My chest tightened, my lungs struggling to pull in air. I scanned the street, my eyes darting from shadow to shadow, my heart pounding so hard it felt like it might burst. Nothing. No one. I forced a laugh, the sound brittle and false in the quiet. “Great, Skyler, now you’re hearing things,” I whispered, but my voice shook, betraying the fear clawing at my insides. I turned back to the bus stop sign, trying to focus on the schedule, but my hands wouldn’t stop trembling.

“Hello, there.”

The voice came from my right, smooth and cool, like a blade sliding across silk. My heart lurched into my throat, and I spun around, nearly dropping my phone. A gasp tore from my lips, my body flooding with adrenaline. There he was, standing just outside the circle of light, a tall man, too tall, his silhouette sharp against the fog. He wore a long, dark purple coat that looked like it belonged in a gothic novel, the kind of thing you’d see in a costume shop but never in real life. A matching fedora sat low on his head, shadowing his face, but his eyes caught the light. They were bright blue, almost glowing, piercing through the haze. His hair was long, silver, and cascading down to the middle of his back, shimmering like moonlight on water.

I couldn’t speak. My chest heaved, breath escaping in short, panicked bursts, my mind screaming “Run!” as my feet remained rooted to the ground. My hands shook so badly I stuffed them into my pockets, trying to hide my fear. He chuckled, a low, velvet sound that sent a shiver down my spine, like cold fingers brushing my skin.

“My apologies,” he said, his voice deep and graceful, each word carefully measured, like he was savoring them. “I didn’t mean to startle you.” He tilted his head slightly, studying me with those unnerving eyes, and I felt like a mouse under a cat’s gaze. “Do you know when the next bus arrives?”

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my tongue sticking to the roof of my mouth. “Uh, I’m not sure. Should be a few minutes.” My voice was small, shaky, barely audible over the pounding of my heart. Where had he come from? The street was empty a second ago, and I hadn’t heard footsteps. Just that clinking. My stomach twisted, a sick feeling settling in my gut.

He smiled, a slow, charming curve of his lips that didn’t reach his eyes. “Thank you.” He extended a gloved hand, his other arm tucked behind his back like some old-fashioned gentleman. “May I have your name?”

My instincts screamed, “*don’t* ” a primal warning that made my skin crawl. But his gaze held me, those blue eyes pinning me in place, like they were pulling the words out of me. I didn’t want to be rude, but it was more than that, like I *had* to answer, like my will wasn’t entirely my own. “Skyler,” I said, barely above a whisper. I reached out, my hand trembling, and his gloved fingers closed around mine, cool even through the leather, sending a chill up my arm.

“A lovely name,” he said, his smile widening just enough to show a hint of teeth. He didn’t offer his own name, just released my hand and straightened, bringing his other arm forward. That’s when I saw it, a cane, simple and black with a silver orb at the top, glinting in the lamplight. My mind flashed to the clinking sound, and my heart skipped a beat. Was that him? No, that sound had come from the *other* side of the street. Hadn’t it? My thoughts spun, my head foggy with confusion and fear.

Before I could process it, he spoke again. “Are you alone, Miss Skyler?” His tone was polite, almost concerned, but there was something underneath it, something dark and hungry that made my stomach lurch.

“Yeah,” I said, then quickly added, “but I’m meeting someone.” A lie, blurted out in a panic, my voice cracking. I didn’t want him to know I was heading home alone, that I was vulnerable. “Just, you know, waiting for the bus.”

He nodded, his eyes never leaving mine, boring into me like he could see every thought in my head. “A beautiful woman like yourself shouldn’t be out alone so late. Dangerous people lurk in the dark corners of the night.”

I forced a laugh, the sound choking in my throat, high and nervous. “I’ll be careful,” I managed, but my voice trembled, and I could feel my hands shaking in my pockets. His words echoed in my mind, not a warning but a promise, like he knew something I didn’t.

Headlights pierced the fog, and relief flooded through me, loosening the knot in my chest for a moment. The bus screeched to a stop, and I practically leapt onto the steps, my legs shaky with adrenaline. I glanced back, half-expecting him to follow, and there he was, climbing aboard behind me, his cane tapping the steps, *clink, clink*. My stomach dropped, the brief relief replaced by a fresh wave of panic. The bus was empty, not a single passenger, just rows of worn seats under flickering fluorescent lights. The air inside felt stale, heavy, like it was pressing against my lungs. I hurried to a seat in the middle, gripping my backpack like a lifeline, my fingers digging into the straps until they ached. I heard him move down the aisle, his steps slow, deliberate, each one sending a shiver through me. I kept my eyes forward, praying he’d sit somewhere else. Anywhere else.

He didn’t. He passed me, his coat brushing the air, the faint scent of something metallic and old lingering in his wake. He took a seat at the very back of the bus, the worst possible place. I could feel his eyes on me, a weight that pressed against the back of my neck, heavy and unrelenting. My skin prickled, every nerve screaming that I was being watched. My breath came in short, shallow gasps, and I tried to focus on the hum of the bus, the squeak of the seats, anything to drown out the feeling. It was no use. I could *feel* him staring, his gaze like a cold finger trailing down my spine, making my heart race faster.

I couldn’t take it anymore. My body moved before my brain caught up, and I turned, just a quick glance over my shoulder. He was there, leaning back in his seat, his head tilted slightly, those blue eyes locked on me. His lips curved into a small, knowing smirk, like he’d caught me in some game. My heart lurched, a sick lurch of fear, and I snapped my head forward, my breath coming in sharp, panicked bursts. *Just make it to your stop, Skyler. Just make it home.* The words repeated in my head like a mantra, but they did little to calm the terror clawing at my chest.

The bus crawled through the fog, stopping every few blocks. Each time the doors hissed open, I prayed he’d get off, my fingers crossed so tightly they hurt. He didn’t. My stop was coming up, and the closer it got, the faster my heart pounded, a frantic rhythm that made my head spin. I gripped the edge of my seat, my knuckles white, my palms sweaty. When the bus finally slowed at my stop, I bolted up, practically running to the door, my legs trembling so badly I nearly tripped. I didn’t look back, not until I was almost off.

“You have a safe night, Miss Skyler,” his voice called, smooth and mocking, cutting through the hum of the bus like a knife. I froze, one foot on the pavement, my heart slamming against my ribs. I glanced back, unable to stop myself. He was still in his seat, smiling that same charming, predatory smile, his eyes glinting in the dim light, unblinking. I gave a weak wave, my hand trembling, and stumbled off the bus, my legs barely holding me up.

As it pulled away, I caught one last glimpse of him through the window, his face pale against the glass, still watching me. Those blue eyes seemed to burn into me, even through the fog, and I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cold. Then the bus vanished into the mist, and I was alone again. I let out a shaky breath, my legs weak, my body trembling from the adrenaline crash. The street was darker than I remembered, the streetlights barely cutting through the mist. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the sound of my sneakers scuffing the pavement as I started toward home.

The relief didn’t last. The air felt heavier now, the fog thicker, like it was pressing against my skin, clinging to me like damp cloth. Every few steps, I glanced over my shoulder, my heart still racing, half-expecting to see him standing there, his silver hair glowing in the dark. My mind replayed his words: *Dangerous people lurk in the dark corners of the night.* Was he warning me, or threatening me? The question gnawed at me, feeding the panic that refused to let go. I shook my head, trying to push the thought away, my breath hitching. He was gone. He stayed on the bus. I was fine. I had to be fine.

Then I heard it, a laugh, soft and faint, carried on the wind. It wasn’t warm or friendly. It was low, guttural, like the growl of an animal circling its prey. My heart stuttered, and I walked faster, my backpack bouncing against my spine, the straps digging into my shoulders. Shadows flickered in the corners of my vision, but when I turned, there was nothing, just empty streets and swirling fog. My breath came in ragged bursts, my chest tight with panic, my hands shaking so badly I could barely hold onto my bag. I was only a few blocks from home, but it felt like miles, each step heavier than the last.

*Clink. Clink. Clink.*

The sound stopped me cold. It was the same metallic tap, sharp and deliberate, coming from behind me. My blood turned to ice, my body frozen in place. I spun around, my eyes wide, but the street was empty. The fog swallowed everything beyond a few feet. My pulse roared in my ears, so loud I could barely think, and I backed up, clutching my backpack straps, my fingers numb. “Who’s there?” I called, my voice trembling, breaking on the last word. No answer. Just silence, thick and suffocating, pressing down on me until I could hardly breathe.

I turned and ran, my sneakers pounding the pavement, the sound echoing in the quiet. The clinking followed, never speeding up, never slowing down, always just behind me, like a shadow I couldn’t shake. My lungs burned, my legs screamed, but I didn’t dare stop. My apartment was so close, just across the park.

*The park*, I thought.

My stomach twisted, a fresh wave of dread washing over me. I hated that park at night. It was a black void, barely lit, the trees looming like skeletal hands reaching out of the fog. However, going around would take an hour, and with that sound behind me, I didn’t have a choice.

I hesitated at the park’s entrance, my breath hitching, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The clinking had stopped again, but the silence was worse, like the calm before a predator strikes. I peered into the darkness, the faint glow of a single lamppost flickering in the distance, barely visible through the fog. My hands shook as I gripped my backpack, my books digging into my chest, my fingers aching from the pressure. I could turn back, take the long way, but the thought of that clinking sound starting again pushed me forward. I stepped into the park, my heart in my throat, my body trembling with every step.

The darkness swallowed me. The fog was thicker here, curling around the trees like ghostly fingers, brushing against my skin. Every rustle, every snap of a twig made my heart leap into my throat, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. I moved as fast as I could, my eyes locked on the lamppost’s faint light, my only guide in the suffocating dark. Something moved to my right, a shadow, quick and fleeting. I gasped, stumbling back, my books nearly slipping from my arms, my heart racing so fast I thought I might pass out. “Hello?” I whispered, my voice barely audible, trembling with fear. Nothing. Just the pounding of my own heart, loud and relentless.

*Clink. Clink. Clink.*

It was louder now, right behind me, each tap like a nail in my coffin. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. I broke into a jog, my legs burning, my chest screaming, my vision blurring with tears of panic. The lamppost was closer, its light a beacon in the dark. I just had to make it there. Just a little farther.

Laughter. Not the sinister chuckle from before, but bright, almost cheerful, like a group of friends sharing a joke. I rounded a bend in the path and saw them, three men standing under the lamppost, their silhouettes sharp against the glow. Relief crashed over me like a wave, loosening the knot in my chest for the first time all night. I recognized them from campus, guys a year ahead of me. I didn’t know their names, but I’d seen them in classes, laughing in the halls. Normal. Safe. My legs nearly gave out with gratitude.

“Hey!” I called, my voice cracking as I ran toward them, my breath ragged. They turned, startled, their faces lit by the lamplight. The tallest one, a blond guy with a friendly smile, stepped forward.

“Hey, are you okay?” he asked, his brow furrowing, his voice calm but concerned.

I nodded, gasping for breath, my hands still shaking as I clutched my backpack. “Someone’s following me,” I said, glancing over my shoulder, my heart still racing. The path was empty, but the hairs on my neck stood on end, my skin crawling with the memory of that clinking sound. “I heard… something. A cane, I think. I don’t know, but I feel that someone is following me!”

The three exchanged looks, their expressions unreadable. The shorter one, with long black hair, frowned. “You sure? We didn’t see anyone.”

“I’m sure,” I insisted, my voice shaking, my chest tight with lingering fear. The third guy, darker-skinned with a serious expression, stepped past me, peering into the fog.

“Nothing’s out there,” he said, but his tone wasn’t reassuring, and a flicker of unease stirred in my gut. The blond guy smiled again, warmer this time, and I clung to it like a lifeline.

“Hey, we know each other, don’t we? From psych class?” he said. “I’m Jake. This is Matt,” he nodded to the black-haired guy, “and that’s Chris.” The darker-skinned guy gave a small nod. “Want us to walk you home? Just to be safe?”

I almost cried with relief, my shoulders sagging as the tension drained out of me. “Yes, please. Thank you,” I said, my voice trembling with gratitude.

We started walking, the three of them forming a loose circle around me. Their presence was like a shield, pushing back the fear that had been clawing at me. Jake chatted lightly, asking about classes, making small talk, his voice soothing. I tried to focus, but my nerves were still raw, my eyes darting to the shadows, my heart still pounding faintly. The park seemed endless, the fog thicker with every step, but I felt safer, like I could finally breathe again.

Then it happened. A hand clamped over my mouth, rough and sudden, cutting off my scream. My heart stopped, my body flooding with icy terror. Two more pairs of hands grabbed my arms, yanking me off the path into the trees. I thrashed and kicked, my screams muffled against the hand, my body trembling with panic. They were too strong, dragging me deeper into the dark, my backpack falling, my books scattering across the ground. My mind screamed, *No, no, no*, as the reality of what was happening sank in.

“Shut up,” Jake hissed, his voice no longer friendly but cold, predatory, sending a fresh wave of terror through me. They pulled me into a clearing, far from the path, where the fog was so thick I could barely see. Jake’s hand stayed over my mouth, his fingers digging into my skin, bruising. Matt pinned my arms above my head, his grip like iron, while Chris held my legs, his hands rough and unyielding. I tried to scream again, but it was useless, the sound trapped in my throat. My heart pounded so hard I thought it would burst, tears streaming down my face as I realized what was coming. Jake leaned close, his breath hot and sour against my ear. 

“Be a good girl and keep quiet,” he whispered, “if you know what’s good for you.” His voice was a blade, sharp and cruel, cutting through my hope. I fought harder, my body straining against their hold, my muscles burning, but it was no use. Jake shoved a rag into my mouth, the taste bitter and chemical, making me gag. He started undoing my jeans, his fingers rough, his eyes gleaming with something sickening, something that made my stomach churn with revulsion. 

“I hope you enjoy this as much as we will,” he said, his grin twisted and cruel, his eyes glinting with a predatory hunger.

My mind was a whirlwind of terror and despair, my body trembling uncontrollably. I was trapped, helpless, my tears soaking the rag as I braced for the worst. Then, a blur of movement. Jake was ripped off me, thrown into the trees with a sickening crunch that echoed in the dark. I gasped, spitting out the rag, my vision blurry with tears, my chest heaving with panic. A figure stood over me, striking Matt and Chris with a thin stick, a cane. The blows were swift, precise, sending them sprawling, their groans swallowed by the fog.

“Now, now,” a familiar voice said, cool and calm, cutting through my terror like a lifeline. “That is no way to treat a lady.” I wiped my eyes, my hands shaking so badly I could barely move. It was him, the silver-haired man, standing tall, his cane at his side like a gentleman at a ball. His blue eyes glinted in the dark, his smile sharp and dangerous, but in that moment, it was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. Relief flooded through me, mixed with a lingering fear that made my heart stutter. The three men scrambled to their feet, shouting, their faces twisted with anger, and charged him.

Jake went first, swinging wildly. The silver-haired man barely moved, just flicked his cane, striking Jake across the face. Blood sprayed, and Jake collapsed, groaning, his face a mess of red. Chris lunged next, but the man sidestepped, tripping him with the cane’s tip, sending him sprawling. Matt tried to attack from behind, but the silver-haired man spun, grabbing his wrist and flipping him onto the ground with effortless grace, like a dancer in a nightmare. He pressed the cane to Matt’s throat, his smile never wavering as Matt choked and gasped, his eyes wide with fear. Chris tried again, but the man caught his fist, squeezing until Chris whimpered and sank to his knees. A sickening crack followed as the man snapped his wrist, then kicked him in the face, the sound dull and final.

He turned to Matt, still pinned under the cane, and struck him across the head with the silver orb, the impact echoing in the quiet. Then Jake staggered to his feet, his face bloody, his eyes burning with rage. He charged with a roar, but the silver-haired man stepped aside, grabbing Jake by the throat and lifting him off the ground like he weighed nothing. His blue eyes glowed brighter, unnatural in the dark, and my breath caught, a new kind of fear mixing with my relief.

“You really should be more careful when out so late,” he said, his voice low, almost playful, but with an edge that made my skin crawl. “Dangerous people lurk in the dark corners of the night.”

His mouth opened, and I saw them, two long, sharp fangs glinting in the faint light. My heart stopped, my body frozen as Jake’s eyes widened, his scream cut off as the man sank his teeth into his neck. Jake’s body jerked, then went limp, his face draining of color, his eyes glassy and lifeless. The silver-haired man dropped him, letting him crumple to the ground like a broken doll. He stood there for a moment, head tilted back, arms spread, as if savoring the moment, like a man standing in the rain, relishing the taste of blood. The sight sent a shiver through me, my mind reeling with horror and awe.

I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My body was frozen, my mind screaming to run, but my legs wouldn’t obey. My heart pounded, a chaotic mix of terror and gratitude swirling in my chest. He had saved me, but at what cost? He turned to me, his smile unchanged, blood glistening on his lips, his eyes glowing faintly in the dark. I flinched, throwing my arms up, my breath hitching as I waited for the end, my body trembling with the certainty that I was next.

But nothing happened.

“Are you alright, Miss Skyler?” His voice was gentle now, almost kind, a stark contrast to the violence I’d just witnessed. I lowered my arms, trembling, my hands shaking so badly I could barely control them. He stood over me, his gloved hand extended once more, his eyes softer but still piercing, like they could see every fear, every thought in my head. My chest heaved, my breath ragged, my mind a tangled mess of relief, fear, and something else, something I couldn’t name.

I stared at his hand, my heart still racing, my body aching from the struggle. My mind screamed to run, to get away from this thing, this creature who had just torn through three men like they were nothing. His eyes held me, and despite the fear, there was a strange warmth in his gaze, a promise of safety that felt both real and impossible.

“Don’t worry,” he said, his smile warm but still edged with something dangerous, something that made my pulse quicken. “You’re safe. You have my word.”

I took his hand, my fingers shaking, and he pulled me to my feet with ease, his touch cool but steady. I fixed my clothes, my hands fumbling, my mind reeling as I tried to process what had just happened. The bodies of Jake, Matt, and Chris lay scattered around us, motionless, their faces pale and lifeless in the fog. My stomach churned, bile rising in my throat, but I couldn’t look away. They had been my classmates, people I thought I could trust, and now they were gone. I should have felt relief, but all I felt was a hollow, aching fear, mixed with a gratitude so intense it made my chest hurt. This man, this creature, had saved me, but the sight of his fangs, the blood on his lips, lingered in my mind, a reminder that he was no hero.

“Thank you,” I whispered, my voice barely audible, trembling with the weight of what I’d seen. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking, my legs weak as I stood there, caught between wanting to run and wanting to collapse. He gave a slight bow, his cane tapping the ground, *clink*, the sound sending a fresh shiver through me.

“My pleasure,” he said, his voice smooth, almost soothing, but it did little to calm the storm in my chest. “Now, I think it’s time that you should be getting home, Miss Skyler.” I glanced at the bodies, my heart racing, my mind struggling to make sense of it all. 

“What about them?” I asked, my voice small, my eyes flicking to the lifeless forms in the fog. He chuckled, a sound that sent a chill down my spine, not entirely unpleasant but laced with something dark.

“I’ll dispose of these creatures in a… kindly manner.” I frowned, a new question burning through the haze of my fear. 

“Was that you? Following me?” My voice trembled, but I needed to know, needed to understand why he was here, why he had saved me. His smile widened, his eyes glinting with something almost playful.

“Yes.”

“But… why were you following me?” I asked, my voice shaking, my hands clenching into fists to steady myself.

He tilted his head, his smile cryptic, his voice smooth as silk. “Some shadows move to guard the light, don’t they?” I swallowed hard, his words twisting in my mind, offering no real answer. Suspicion gnawed at me, and I pressed further.

“Did you know those men were going to attack me?” My voice was steadier now, though my heart still raced. His smile didn’t falter, his blue eyes gleaming with an unsettling glint.

“The night whispers its secrets to those who listen.”

“How?” I demanded, my voice rising slightly, frustration tightening my chest. “How did you know?” He took a step closer, his presence overwhelming, his silver hair catching the faint light like a ghost.

“Some hearts are stained long before they act. I merely read the stains.” I glanced at the bodies around us, their lifeless forms half-hidden in the fog, then back at him, my eyes narrowing with suspicion. 

“If you were protecting me, why follow me like that? Why creep around in the dark?” My voice trembled, sharp with frustration, not anger, but a desperate need for answers. I held his gaze, my heart pounding, my fingers digging into my palms.

He stepped forward slowly, his movements graceful, deliberate, like a predator closing in. He leaned in, his face inches from mine, his lips so close to my ear I could feel his breath, cool and steady. 

“Because I love the smell of fear before the hunt,” he whispered, his voice low and intimate, sending a shiver down my spine.

A cold dread washed over me, my blood turning to ice, my body trembling as his words sank in. My frustration dissolved, replaced by a primal fear that rooted me to the spot. My mind screamed that he was dangerous, that I should run, but my feet wouldn’t move, caught in the spell of his gaze. “What are you?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper, shuddering with fear and a strange, unwanted curiosity.

He chuckled, placing a finger to his nose and winking, a gesture so playful it was almost disarming. “That would be telling.”

Before I could react, he waved his hand in front of my face, a quick, fluid motion. The world blurred, my vision swimming. My body felt weightless for a moment, like I was falling through the fog. 

Suddenly, I was standing in front of my apartment building. My backpack and books were neatly stacked on the steps, untouched, as if nothing had happened. I spun around, my heart pounding, scanning the street for any sign of him, but it was empty. No fog, no clinking, no silver-haired man. The night was clear now, the street lights brighter, but the silence felt wrong, like it was hiding something. My chest ached, not just with the fading adrenaline but with a hollow, gnawing feeling, like I’d lost something vital.

I touched my heart, my fingers trembling, my breath uneven. My mind replayed the night, the clinking, his glowing eyes, the blood on his lips, the way he saved me. I should have been terrified, and part of me was, my body still shaking with the memory of his fangs, the lifeless bodies in the fog. Yet, there was something else, something I couldn’t shake, a strange, reckless longing, a pull toward him that made no sense.

I stood there, frozen on the steps, my hand pressed against my chest, feeling the frantic beat of my heart. The night’s horrors played on a loop in my mind: Jake’s cruel grin, the rag in my mouth, the silver-haired man’s fangs sinking into his neck. I should have run inside, locked the door, and buried myself under the covers, but my feet wouldn’t move. 

My breath steadied, but my mind was a storm of conflicting emotions. I was terrified of him, of what he was, of the ease with which he’d killed, the bloodlust in his eyes as he stood over Jake’s body. Yet… I was grateful, so grateful that it hurt. A deep, aching gratitude for the way he’d saved me, protected me when I was helpless. His voice echoed in my head, smooth and gentle, promising safety, but his words about the hunt, the way he’d inhaled my fear, sent shivers down my spine. I felt torn, caught between terror and fascination, my body still trembling from the night’s trauma but my heart pulled toward him, like a moth to a flame I knew would burn me.

I stared into the dark, half-expecting to see those glowing blue eyes and silver hair watching me from the shadows, half-hoping I would. My heart raced, not just with fear but with a twisted, unwanted curiosity. What was he? A monster, a savior, or something else entirely? The question burned in my mind, but so did his smile, his voice, the way he’d stood over me like a guardian and a predator all at once. I felt like I was standing on the edge of something vast and unknown, a pull toward him that defied reason, that scared me as much as it intrigued me. My mom’s voice echoed in my head, her Sunday calls urging me to trust my gut, but my gut was a mess, torn between running from him and wanting to know more. I hated that part of me, the reckless part that wanted to see him again, to understand why he’d chosen me, why he’d followed me, why he’d saved me.

I stood there for a long moment, my hand on my chest, my breath steadying but my mind racing. The night was quiet, but it felt alive, like it was watching me, waiting. Finally, I turned, picked up my books, and walked inside, my legs heavy, my heart conflicted. As I closed the door behind me, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was still out there, somewhere in the dark, his silver hair glinting in the moonlight, his eyes following me. And despite everything, despite the fear, the blood, the horror, a part of me hoped he was.",1,1753787497.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I have a 2 day hangover from sustaining Silent Knowledge (Seeing) for 3 hours or so.

You just can't do that if you're a beginner to seeing. You run out of dreaming energy, and apparently we need to keep some in reserve, for our daily activity.

That wouldn't be surprising. The witches always said that dreaming energy IS sexual energy.  So maybe it's also used in other ways.

Oddly, if you drain it too low, the emanations seem to become visible a day or two later, since those always lurk behind the interpretations produced by dreaming energy.

They become visible in such detail that it begins to seem to make sense, that the old seers could figure out precisely which emanations to light up, in order to match the allies.  They used that to extend their lifespan, by burying themselves under large rocks, with their allies present.

I tried to figure out what various patches of the emanations I could perceive indicated was ""lit up"" last night, but that's a bit like trying to figure out what patch of smoke you see is the ""green smoke"", when several smoke bombs of different colors were set off in the same area.

https://preview.redd.it/vngpr3ocosff1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7349dbd684ef815c485de6b0dd134a0d3fc3ca8

I've proven 20 minutes is ok for ""seeing"" during Silent Knowledge, and 30 makes it likely you'll fall asleep and stop.

But if you prepare a lot of time on the weekend so that you can go as long as you like, and make sure you've had more than enough sleep so that you won't get sleepy while ""seeing"", you can easily do it for hours.

And then you'll likely find out that there's a price for that.

On several levels.

We all have to figure that out on our own, but I suppose it's no different than lifting weights for too long, as a beginner.

Or thinking you can drink 8 cups of coffee and work on extremely difficult math problems for 12 hours at your job.

There's a price on any concentrated effort, if it's not something you built up to.

This is one thing you learn if you try to ""see"" for hours.

Don Juan even suggested that if you gaze at the emanations for too long, you can be ""absorbed"".  Or was it ""dissolved""?

And there are many types of *seeing* to look at! Some are ideal. They're pleasingly concrete.

But most are annoyingly vague. Carlos recommended that type, because it saves dreaming attention.  I didn't understand why you needed to save on it at the time he said that, but now I might have a clue.

It could be, it's not about losing the energy to ""see"", since you're always going to ""see"" something.  

Maybe it's more about not giving yourself a hangover later on?

He did a pantomime of a ""seer"" looking at something floating by him to the right and slightly up relative to the seer, as if it were emerging from a tunnel. The seer realized what it was before it fully materialized, and then turned his head away to look for the next thing.

Carlos often did pantomimes in class.  I suppose, we don't realize the full effect of those yet. He was *intending* for us!

The classic pantomime was his gred to get a purple puff floating up high, where he jumped up to grab it, pulled it down and smeared it on his energy pouch, and then licked his chops as if it were the tastiest thing ever.

By doing that, he planted the seed of darkroom!  Could even be, his ally thought that was amusing, and so she taught it to me as a video game we could all play, which became ""darkroom"".

Carlos also warned us about ""the abstract"", which in the end feels like a trap for your awareness.

And you can also get sucked into those videos in the air, but not have any lucidity so that you don't get to enjoy how cool that is! You're only aware of it, after you return.

I suppose the best of all is when there's a Silent Knowledge Entity explaining the vision to you.

As for the pantomimes Carlos did for us, they're built into the Tensegrity also, so pay attention to what was said about them, in his books and videos.

new people...

It's not ""darkroom"" if you aren't doing tensegrity.

I mean, come on...

Attention seekers can't learn sorcery.

Not because they're ""bad people"". It's not a moral issue.

It's all about where your attention flows, directed by your internal dialogue.

If it's flowing into some imaginary situation where your greatness as a seer gives you fame, money, and women, you won't be able to see what's really there, once you remove your internal dialogue.

I hope women don't feel neglected in my posts, because I use ""he"" for examples.

In fact, women do better with sorcery.  It's the men who need more help.

I have a technical question about the Aerolight Transit Bottle I just purchased at Target.

The care instructions say:

“If you have purchased a water bottle, please note that this item was designed for high flow rate appropriate for drinking cold liquid. Drinking hot liquid too quickly can lead to scalding.”

I’m unclear on what that means exactly. Is it unsafe to use this bottle for hot drinks like coffee? That was my main reason for buying it.

Also, I saw a nearly identical product online called the Aerolight Transit Mug. Aside from the name, I can’t tell what the difference is. Did I get the wrong version for hot drinks?

Thanks in advance for your help!

1mc8kax,https://www.reddit.com/r/75HARD/comments/1mc8kax/day_57_is_done/,Day 57 is done!,"Day 57 was an interesting day. For the first time the heat wave we’re experiencing hit me a bit hard and I felt quite fatigued at the end of the day, so I decided to take it easy and make it an active recovery day, with two outdoor walks.

The first walk was at around 11:30AM when the day was settling into the hottest part of the day, and I had a time sensitive errand to make, so I was moving purposefully.

It definitely sapped my energy and left me feeling lethargic when I got home.

Coffee and water wasn’t helping either, I had to take a 20 minute nap that turned into an hour long.  Still, I was tired and moving around slowly.

I had another appointment with a client at 5pm and was finished by around 8:30.  

I was thinking about going to the gym and lifting weights but was way too tired and decided not to take a risk and potentially get hurt, so I decided to go for another walk instead, and once finished I had a small bite to eat and went to bed.

I’ve been very mindful about listening to my body throughout the journey, and pushing myself with purpose rather than just going all out and trying to do too much.  Overall I feel much better and in a great physical condition, and though this is a gruelling experience, I have no major soreness or pain, despite increasing the intensity of my workouts as I progress through the journey.

I’m still not thinking of the days remaining, just the next day and the next task that I have to complete,  every day is its own beast to take on.

Let’s go day 58, you’re next!

Stay Hard.

now, it's his last week at work. we've had plans with another friend from work on friday, but now both me and my friend got sick-ish. i had planned to make a more obvious move on friday, since it's kinda my last chance. but now my crush asked me to the movies today! 

we're usually a trio, so when our mutual friend went to grab a coffee, my crush sat down next to me and asked if we wanted to go to the movies. i was a little confused at first (since he said we) and asked if he meant the three of us or just the two of us. he clarified he meant the two of us. 

just when we wanted to set a date & place, our friend came back and since she was oblivious to what was going on, she ended up interrupting the moment-- 
but i told my crush he can just text me time & place (and even if he doesnt, i'll likely see him at work again tomorrow - unless i get even more sick). 

usually i wouldn't jump to conclusions and assume this is a date. but literally the day before we were flirting again, i half-jokingly asked him if he wanted to kiss and he confessed that his friends told him he's too stupid to catch a hint/flirt and will likely never find someone. to which i then pointed at me and gave him a look, trying to imply that i'd gladly go out with him...

1mc8inh,https://www.reddit.com/r/USTravel/comments/1mc8inh/road_trip_plans_advice/,Road trip plans - advice,"Hi there,

We're two women from Poland planning a road trip in November (around 18 days). We've prepared four itineraries but can't decide which one to choose, and I was wondering if you could help us out.

A little about us:  
We enjoy nature (though we’re not big hikers), rural areas, and cities. We won’t spend much time in museums. We love coffee, music, and food, and we’re more into bars, taverns, and honky-tonks than nightclubs. I’ll be the only driver, but I don’t mind. Earlier this year I drove 1,500 miles solo in Arizona.

by Anthony Olszewski

During the early-70s, my father owned a tavern at the corner of 15th and Grove in Jersey City. I’d help him clean up Sunday mornings. At noon, he’d open the bar and I’d leave to walk home to the Jersey City Heights.

The first part of the walk was beneath the railroad overpasses that line the north-eastern edge of Jersey City. Crossing into Hoboken, I’d enter a silent stagnant neighborhood of under-occupied buildings and closed stores. One in particular fascinated me. At the corner of Observer and Monroe there was an antiquated storefront. The shop window extended out from the building’s brick wall and was elevated some three feet above the side walk, supported by what was once fancy woodwork. Sometimes, I’d go out of my way, crossing the street, to peer inside. Gazing through the wavy, greenish glass, I’d try to imagine what kind of business was once there. As the the only thing inside now was a yellowed copy of a defunct New York newspaper with the headline “Hitler invades Poland!,” whatever was once there was there a very long time ago.

One day, everything was different. Double-parked new Cadillacs, Lincolns and Oldsmobiles ringed in a loud crowd of burly guys in slacks and brightly-colored tight shirts. A couple of ladders were in place with assistants on the ground hoisting up a sign: Italian-American Civil Rights League.

Each Sunday as I went by, I’d see that the little colony of Italian pride and solidarity was buzzing with activity. A gas range was now up in the front, visible from the street. A guy weighing maybe 300 pounds and wearing a baseball cap on backwards was always standing at the stove stirring something in a big pot. Men sat outside, elbows propped up on the backs of reversed chairs. Many of the League members held coffee mugs. From time to time, someone came out of the store with a big jug of wine and poured it into the mugs. People carried heavy cases inside glancing nervously over their shoulders. Every so often a car would screech to a stop with a lurch forward and the driver’d lean out the vehicle’s window and scream something like, “Hey, SAL is your cousin DANNY AROUND?”

On June 28, 1971, Joe Colombo, head of the Colombo Family — and the Italian-American Civil Rights League — was shot. The following Sunday, as I headed up Monroe, I looked across the street. The sign was gone. The cars were gone. The people were gone. The stove was gone. I walked across the street for a closer look. The only thing inside now was an old newspaper: “Hitler invades Poland!”

On most days, he tries to sleep 6-8 hours, but seems to have unnatural abilities to rest well / function without sleep.

I have witnessed these stories first hand being his roommate for 6 years (college + first job), but I once saw him not sleep for 4 straight days during finals. He graduated top of our class from a difficult school with 2 difficult degrees. Saw him drink coffee once, otherwise no supplements while the rest of us crushed adderall pills. Regularly sleeps very little and functions well mentally and physically (triathlete). He never fell asleep in class, in the car, anywhere unless intended.

When he does want to sleep, I have seen him sleep 14 straight hours easily in a cramped economy flight without waking. He always falls asleep quickly each night and seems to have great rest when keeping a regular schedule.

I am seriously dumbfounded. Is there research on how to get your body to function in this way? Is this a genetic thing? His younger brother falls asleep everywhere and can’t function at all without rest.

I would sleep 10-12 hours a night and wake up exhausted. My brain fog was so thick I could hardly follow a conversation. I never knew how I was going to feel. My skin was dry. I was so tired I would stand in the shower and not even dry off. I barely recognized myself.  
  
Doctor after doctor dismissed my concerns and shrugged me off.  
  
""Probably just stress.""  
  
""Eat more vegetables.""  
  
""Your labs are all within range.""  
  
I did everything they suggested - more sleep, therapy, cut out caffeine, eat clean. Nothing seemed to work.  
  
I started to believe that this was just who I was - tired, foggy, useless.  
  
It wasn't until I started doing some research - connecting the dots that no one else was connecting - that I discovered that my thyroid was not functioning properly. And even when I got help for that, it did not fix everything.  
  
But I kept going. I fell down this research rabbit hole. And I started to observe all of these overlooked patterns:  
 \- My vitamin levels, my diet etc..

Then  I found a doctor who is thinking out of the box..And with his help,

I made some quiet changes. I added vitamins and minerals to my daily routin. Made few diet changes. I changed how I eat in the mornings. I stopped drinking coffee on an empty stomach.  
Bit by bit… I started to come back.

Not cured. Not perfect. But functional. Present. Myself.

I still get mad about how long it took. How hard it was to be believed. But I’m sharing this in case someone else is stuck in that same loop being told it’s all in your head when it’s actually in your cells.

Please keep pushing. Keep asking questions. You deserve answers.",1,1753786964.0,thyroidhealth,0,1.0,False

Adriana Cotton lived a life of perfect order, a flawless extension of her husband Gifford Stanton's brand. Her dresses were tailored, her posture straight, her smile measured. She was the epitome of a Stanton wife.

But on her birthday, she found him at a food truck, silk tie loosened, peeling a hot dog for a young woman giggling across from him. It was Jovita Griffith, the daughter of their former housekeeper, whose education Gifford had been funding for years under the guise of charity.

Adriana's carefully constructed composure shattered. She confronted them, only to be met with Gifford's dismissive excuses and Jovita's feigned innocence. She posted a scathing selfie, but Gifford, blind to the truth, accused her of being overly emotional and announced Jovita would be staying with them.

Later that night, she returned home to find her surprise birthday party in full swing, hosted by Jovita, who was wearing Adriana's vintage Chanel dress. Jovita, smug and victorious, whispered venomous words, claiming Gifford found Adriana ""cold in bed. Like a fish.""

The insult, a brutal blow, pushed Adriana past her breaking point. Her hand flew up, connecting with Jovita's cheek, the s**p echoing through the silent room. Gifford, enraged, cradled Jovita, glaring at Adriana as if she were a monster.

He roared, ""Have you lost your mind?"" He accused her of humiliating him, of being out of control, and ordered her banished to the countryside. Adriana, however, was done playing by his rules. She called Alexzander Wilson, her childhood friend, who arrived by helicopter to whisk her away.

""Not anymore,"" she told Gifford, her voice clear and strong. ""We are not a family."" She threw divorce papers in his face, leaving him and Jovita to their chaos.


Chapter 1
Adriana Cotton lived by a set of rules. Not her rules, but his. Gifford Stanton's rules.

He was a man of impeccable taste and discipline, and as his wife, she was expected to be the same. Her dresses were always perfectly tailored, her posture always straight, her smile always measured. She was a flawless extension of the Stanton brand.

But Gifford, the architect of this rigid world, was breaking his own code.

He was sitting at a food truck, of all places. He had loosened his silk tie, a transgression she'd never witnessed. He leaned back in a cheap plastic chair, a half-peeled hot dog in his hand. He offered it to the young woman giggling across from him.

Adriana parked her luxury SUV down the street. The click of her designer heels on the pavement was sharp and angry. She walked toward them.

""Mr. Stanton, tough day at the office? Is this your new conference room?""

Gifford looked up. The relaxed expression on his face vanished, replaced by a mask of shock and guilt.

From his open laptop on the table, a voice chirped, ""Mr. Stanton, taking your lady out for street food, huh, haha...""

Adriana leaned into the camera's view. The man on the screen, one of Gifford's associates, froze. His jesting smile disappeared. ""Ms. Cotton,"" he stammered nervously.

Gifford slammed the laptop shut.

""Adriana, let me explain. This is Jovita Griffith. Mrs. Miller's daughter. She just got back from overseas.""

Jovita smiled, her eyes wide and innocent. ""Ms. Cotton, it's so nice to finally meet you! Gifford talks about you all the time.""

Adriana knew who she was. The daughter of their family's former housekeeper, Mrs. Miller. Gifford had been funding her education abroad for years. Millions. He had called it charity. A noble gesture. Adriana now saw how naive she had been.

She ignored Jovita's outstretched hand. Instead, she sat down and picked up the hot dog Gifford had been peeling. Gifford, a man so obsessed with decorum he wouldn't touch food with his bare hands. She once saw him at a gala, faced with a messy hors d'oeuvre, meticulously use a fork and knife to eat it. Now, he was peeling a hot dog for another woman.

Adriana took a small, deliberate bite. She chewed for a moment, then delicately spit the food into a napkin.

""This hot dog tastes off.""

Jovita's eyes immediately filled with tears. ""Ms. Cotton, it's all my fault. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to cause a misunderstanding...""

A misunderstanding? Adriana felt a cold laugh rising in her ch**t. She pulled out her phone. She framed a selfie to include all three of them, zooming in on Jovita's perfectly tear-streaked face.

Jovita gasped and reached for the phone. ""What are you doing?""

Adriana's glare stopped her cold. ""Just taking a picture. Why are you so flustered?""

Right there, in front of them, she posted the photo to her social media. The caption was simple and brutal.

""My husband's birthday surprise. So unique.""

Gifford frowned. He wanted to stop her but didn't know what to say. After a long, tense silence, he finally sighed. ""Adriana, don't be so sensitive. I just see her as a little sister.""

Jovita immediately chimed in, her voice trembling. ""That's right, Ms. Cotton...""

Adriana cut her off with a sharp laugh. ""Calling the housekeeper's daughter 'sister'? My family doesn't have that rule.""

Jovita's tears flowed freely now, as if she had suffered a terrible injustice.

Adriana stood up to leave. She had seen enough.

But Gifford shot out of his chair and grabbed her wrist. His grip was surprisingly strong, bruising. ""Adriana Cotton, you are being incredibly rude. A wife of a Stanton shouldn't act like this.""

Always that line. The wife of a Stanton.

His tone grew impatient. ""Alright, stop making a scene. Jovita just got back, and she has nowhere to stay. She'll be staying with us for a while. Drive us home.""

Adriana felt an absurd urge to laugh. She turned and looked directly into his deep, angry eyes.

""Gifford Stanton,"" she asked, her voice dangerously calm, ""why today?""


Chapter 2
Gifford looked momentarily confused by her question. ""What do you mean, why today?""

He started to repeat his earlier excuse. ""I told you, she just got back...""

""Stop,"" Adriana cut him off, her voice low but sharp. ""Today is my birthday, Gifford. You chose my birthday to do this.""

She glanced at Jovita, who was now hiding her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking with sobs. But Adriana saw the flicker of triumph in her eyes before she looked away.

""And she knows it, doesn't she? She's enjoying this.""

Adriana thought of all the years she had spent molding herself into the perfect Stanton wife. She gave up her fiery personality, her love for loud music, her casual clothes. She learned about fine art, opera, and the intricacies of corporate law, all to stand beside him, to be a credit to him. She had given up herself.

And for what? For him to dismiss her pain, to champion the daughter of a housekeeper over her, on her own birthday. The unfairness of it was a physical weight in her ch**t.

""You're being overly emotional,"" Gifford said, his voice laced with disdain.

That was the final push. Adriana wrenched her arm from his grip with a strength that surprised them both. She turned and walked back to her car without another word.

Jovita's voice followed her, a soft, wounded wh**per. ""Gifford, maybe I should leave... I've made Ms. Cotton so unhappy.""

Adriana felt a wave of nausea. The girl's performance was flawless.

She got in her SUV and drove, with no destination in mind. The city lights blurred through her unshed tears. She remembered Gifford's proposal, so formal and correct. He had promised her a life of respect, of partnership. A lie. Every word a lie. She regretted her choice so deeply it hurt to breathe.

Her phone rang, startling her. It was Alexzander Wilson.

""Happy birthday, Addy,"" his cheerful voice boomed through the car's speakers. ""I miss you like crazy. Say the word and I'll fly back right now.""

Adriana managed a weak smile. ""You're in Tokyo, Alex. Don't be ridiculous.""

""For you, I'd swim,"" he said, and she knew he meant it. His devotion was a stark, painful contrast to the coldness she had just left behind.

After an hour of aimless driving, she finally went home. It was late, past midnight. She expected a dark, quiet house.

Instead, the mansion was blazing with lights. Music and laughter spilled out onto the manicured lawn.

She walked in and stopped dead. Her living room was filled with people. It was a party. A surprise birthday party she never wanted.

And in the center of it all was Jovita, acting as the hostess. She was greeting guests, directing the catering staff, a radiant smile on her face.

Then Adriana saw it. Jovita was wearing the vintage Chanel dress Adriana had been saving for a special occasion. Her special occasion.

Adriana felt like a stranger in her own home.

Gifford saw her and hurried over, a strained smile on his face. ""Adriana! You're back. We were worried. I thought, since the evening started so poorly, a little celebration might...""

Adriana's eyes were fixed on Jovita. ""What is she doing, Gifford? Hosting my birthday party?""

""She was just trying to help,"" he said, his voice defensive. ""She organized all of this to make it up to you.""

""And the dress?"" Adriana's voice was ice. ""Did you give her permission to wear my clothes, too?""

""Don't be so petty, Adriana,"" he snapped. ""It's just a dress.""

Jovita watched them from across the room, a small, triumphant smile playing on her lips. A few guests, friends of the family, started to move toward them, sensing the tension.

""Adriana, Gifford, happy birthday!"" one of them said, trying to diffuse the situation.

Gifford was pulled away into a conversation, leaving Adriana alone.

Jovita seized the opportunity. She glided over to Adriana, her voice a poisonous wh**per only she could hear.

""You see? This is my place now.""

She leaned closer. ""You got what you deserved. You were never good enough for him.""

""He and I,"" Jovita purred, ""we belong together. We always have.""

Adriana looked down at the younger woman, at her smug, victorious face.

""Are you trying to be a homewrecker, Jovita?"" she asked, her voice dangerously soft.

""We have a history you know nothing about,"" Jovita sneered. She leaned in, her lips almost touching Adriana's ear. ""He told me you're cold in bed. Like a fish.""

The words hit Adriana harder than a physical blow. In that moment, all the rules, all the discipline, all the carefully constructed composure shattered.

Without a second thought, Adriana's hand flew up and connected with Jovita's cheek. The sound of the slap echoed through the suddenly silent room.


Chapter 3
The music stopped. Every conversation died. All eyes were on them.

Gifford ripped himself away from his conversation and rushed forward, his face a mask of fury.

He pushed past Adriana and knelt beside Jovita, who was now crumpled on the floor, sobbing dramatically. ""Are you okay? Jovita, are you hurt?""

He cradled her protectively, glaring up at Adriana as if she were a monster.

Adriana, however, was perfectly calm. She felt a strange sense of clarity. She straightened her dress, her movements graceful and deliberate.

Her eyes landed on the diamond necklace around Jovita's throat. It was a one-of-a-kind piece Gifford had given her for their first anniversary.

She reached down and, with a swift, clean motion, unclasped the necklace. Jovita gasped, but was too stunned to resist.

Adriana held the glittering necklace up for everyone to see.

""Thank you all for coming to celebrate with me,"" she announced, her voice ringing through the silent hall. ""As a party favor...""

She walked over to a young, wide-eyed wife of a junior partner. The woman stared, mesmerized. Adriana smiled warmly and fastened the priceless necklace around the woman's neck.

""Happy birthday to me,"" Adriana said. ""It looks better on you.""

The woman stammered, speechless with shock and gratitude.

Adriana turned back to the crowd. ""The party's over. Please leave.""

Her tone was polite but firm. No one argued. Guests began to file out, whispering amongst themselves, their eyes darting between the composed wife, the furious husband, and the weeping mistress.

Once the last guest had departed, the silence in the grand hall was heavy and suffocating.

Gifford helped Jovita to her feet and settled her on a sofa before turning on Adriana.

""Have you lost your mind?"" he roared.

Adriana looked at him, truly looked at him, and felt a deep, hollowing sadness. This was the man she had loved, the man she had changed her entire life for.

""She in**lted me, Gifford. In our home. At my party.""

""So you hit her? You humiliate me in front of everyone?""

Adriana felt too tired to argue. She turned away from him. ""I'm going to bed.""

Gifford grabbed her arm. ""We're not done.""

His face was contorted with a mixture of anger and exhaustion. ""I'm tired of this, Adriana.""

She simply looked at his hand on her arm until he let go. She walked to the grand staircase, her back straight.

He sighed, the anger draining out of him, replaced by a weary frustration. ""Look,"" he said, his voice softer. ""I know this is difficult. But I have a responsibility to Jovita. Her mother saved my grandmother's life years ago. I owe them.""

""I will talk to her,"" he promised, as if it were a great concession. ""I'll teach her some manners.""

Adriana stopped on the stairs and looked back at him. She felt a bitter laugh escape her lips. ""You'll teach her? You, who let her into our home to destroy our marriage?""

""Will you teach her not to sl**p with another woman's husband? Or is that part of the lesson plan?""

Gifford's face turned red. ""That's enough!"" he shouted, slamming his fist on a nearby table. The sound echoed in the cavernous room.

""She is my family! Just like you are!""

Family. The word felt like a lie. Tears pricked at Adriana's eyes, but she refused to let them fall. Not in front of him.

""You broke every single one of your precious rules for her, Gifford,"" she said, her voice trembling slightly. ""The rules you drilled into me for years.""

She began to list them, her voice growing stronger with each word. ""No casual attire in public. No eating with your hands. No emotional outbursts. No behavior that could tarnish the Stanton name.""

""You did all of it. For her. In one afternoon.""

Gifford's face shifted through a dozen emotions: anger, guilt, shame. He stood there, speechless.

Adriana took a deep breath. She pulled out her phone and called the head of their household staff.

""Please prepare the north wing guest suite for Miss Griffith,"" she said, her voice crisp and authoritative. ""And ensure none of her belongings remain in the main house.""

The butler's hesitant voice came through the phone. ""But, Ma'am, Mr. Stanton said...""

Adriana didn't let him finish. ""I am Mrs. Stanton. Do it.""

She hung up.

Gifford stared at her, his face ashen. ""Adriana, calm down. Let's talk about this in the morning.""

""There's nothing to talk about,"" she said.

He stared at her for a long moment, then turned and stormed out of the house, slamming the front door behind him.

The sound echoed through the empty hall.

Alone, Adriana finally let herself collapse onto the bottom step of the staircase. The tears she had held back for so long finally came, silent and hot, streaming down her face.


Chapter 4
The next morning, Adriana walked downstairs, her face a mask of composure. She had cried all night, but she had put on her makeup, dressed in a sharp business suit, and was ready to face the day. Her dignity was the only thing she had left.

She found Jovita in the kitchen, humming a cheerful tune. She was wearing a pair of silky, ridiculously short pajamas that belonged to Adriana. She was making breakfast, acting as if she owned the place.

When Jovita saw Adriana, she gave a little g**p and tried to pull the thin robe tighter around herself.

""Oh, Ms. Cotton! I'm so sorry. I couldn't find my things, and I was just so hungry. I hope you don't mind.""

Gifford was sitting at the breakfast nook, sipping coffee and reading the paper. He didn't even look up.

Adriana ignored Jovita and addressed her husband. ""I believe the kitchen is for staff. We have a chef.""

Gifford finally lowered his paper, his expression annoyed. ""She was just being thoughtful, Adriana. Don't make everything a fight.""

Jovita immediately started to cry. ""I'm sorry, Ms. Cotton. I'll go. I didn't mean to intrude.""

Adriana let out a short, cold laugh and turned to leave.

""Adriana!"" Gifford called after her, but she didn't stop.

She drove straight to the city's most ruthless divorce lawyer.

""I want to file for divorce,"" she said, her voice steady. ""And I want a full breakdown of our shared assets. I want to know exactly what I am entitled to.""

The lawyer, a sharp woman named Ms. Davenport, nodded. ""I'll get my team on it immediately, Ms. Cotton. We'll make sure you get everything you deserve.""

Adriana spent the day in a haze, ignoring the constant buzz of her phone. Dozens of calls and texts from Gifford. She deleted them all without reading.

When she returned home that evening, the house was quiet. She walked up the sweeping staircase toward her bedroom, hoping for a moment of peace.

She pushed open the door and her breath caught in her throat.

The room was a disaster. Her king-sized bed was unmade, the silk sheets tangled and thrown aside. A lacy black piece of lingerie-not hers-was tossed carelessly on the floor. Gifford's shirt and pants were crumpled in a heap by the door.

The air was thick with the cloying scent of cheap perfume and s*x.

Adriana felt her knees go weak. This was her sanctuary. Their marital bed. The line had been crossed in the most brutal way possible.

""Gifford!"" The name was a raw scream torn from her throat.

He appeared in the doorway moments later, looking flustered. He took in the scene and his eyes widened in shock.

""What is this?"" Adriana demanded, her voice shaking with rage. ""Explain this to me.""

""I... I don't know,"" he stammered, avoiding her eyes. ""Jovita was helping the maids with laundry, maybe...""

He denied knowing anything about the lingerie.

Just then, Jovita appeared behind him, her cheeks flushed a pretty pink.

""Oh, Ms. Cotton,"" she said, feigning shyness. ""I am so, so sorry. I saw your beautiful lingerie when I was helping put away clothes, and I just couldn't resist trying it on. I never thought you'd come home so early.""

Gifford looked relieved. ""See? It was just a misunderstanding. She's a young girl, she was just being curious."" He turned to Adriana. ""Now, can we please just drop this?""

The rage in Adriana's ch**t was so immense she thought she might explode.

""A misunderstanding?"" she asked, her voice dangerously low. ""What's next? You'll tell me if I walked in on you two in bed, you were just 'exercising'together?""

Gifford's face darkened with anger. ""You've changed, Adriana. You've become bitter and suspicious.""

He accused her of being unreasonable.

Adriana thought about the woman she used to be before him-fiery, confident, and free. She had become so obedient, so quiet. This wasn't her. It was a role she had played, and she was done.

From her briefcase, she pulled out a thick manila envelope and threw it on the messy bed.

""Divorce papers, Gifford. Sign them.""

His eyes widened, his pupils shrinking to pinpricks. ""You can't be serious.""

""I've never been more serious in my life.""

""Adriana, calm down,"" he pleaded.

""I am calm,"" she stated, her voice flat. ""I want a divorce.""

With a roar of fury, he snatched the papers and ripped them to shreds. ""I will not divorce you! This is ridiculous!""

Jovita began to sob in the doorway, her body trembling. ""It's all my fault,"" she cried. ""If I had never come back, none of this would have happened.""

Adriana turned her cold gaze on the girl. ""You're right. You never should have come back.""

Jovita wailed louder.

Gifford rushed to her side, pulling her into a protective embrace. ""She's just a child, Adriana! How can you be so cruel?""

The argument escalated, their shouts echoing through the house. The noise brought the Stanton Matriarch, Gifford's grandmother, hurrying down the hall.

The old woman took in the scene-the trashed bedroom, her weeping grandson, the crying girl, and Adriana's stony face. She sighed heavily.

""Adriana, my dear,"" she said, her voice frail but firm. ""I am so sorry for all of this."" She explained the debt of gratitude the family owed Jovita's mother, who had once saved her from a terrible accident.

""We are taking care of her as a way of repaying that debt,"" the matriarch said, tears in her eyes. ""Please, forgive Gifford's foolishness. I will take Jovita away. She will not bother you again.""

Gifford, looking chastened, also apologized. ""Adriana, I'm sorry. Please, give me one more chance.""

Looking at the old woman's desperate face, Adriana's resolve wavered. Perhaps it could be fixed. She gave a small, hesitant nod.

The matriarch sent Jovita away. A fragile peace settled over the house. For a few days, Gifford was attentive and kind. Adriana started to think about calling her lawyer, about withdrawing the divorce petition.

Then, one evening, the front door burst open. Gifford stormed in, his face a thundercloud. Behind him, held up by a butler, was Jovita. Her clothes were torn, her face was bruised, and she was crying hysterically.

Gifford pointed a shaking finger at Adriana. ""You! How could you do this to her?""

*Where pitching meets puns, and spreads meet sarcasm.*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Pitchers and a Run Total**  
The Cubs (62-43) and Brewers (62-43) are NL titans squaring off in a clash of styles. The Brewers, favored at **-115** (implied probability: **53%**), lean on small-ball wizardry, while the Cubs (-105) bet on thunderous home runs. But the real drama? The starting pitchers.

**Jacob Misiorowski**, the 23-year-old Brewers rookie, is a human highlight reel, having dominated with a 2.80 ERA and 120 strikeouts in 115 innings. He’s like a Swiss watch—precise, terrifying, and definitely not for sale on eBay. Opposite him, **Matthew Boyd** (Cubs) is the “veteran” (read: old enough to know better but young enough to try), with a 3.65 ERA and a fastball that’s slower than a sloth on a coffee break.

The totals line? **8.5 runs**, with the **Under** at **-110**. Given both starters’ track records, this feels like betting on a chess match between two grandmasters.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Rookies, and a Sprinkle of Chaos**  
No major injuries reported—phew! But here’s what’s cooking:

* **Misiorowski** is a rookie phenom, but let’s be real: He’s also a 23-year-old who’s probably never seen a 40-year-old MLB hitter swing a bat like a lightsaber. His confidence is admirable, though.
* **Boyd** is… well, Boyd. A career journeyman with a “meh” ERA and a knack for keeping games close. He’s the baseball equivalent of a “meh” emoji in a text thread.
* The Brewers’ small-ball approach is like a Sudoku puzzle—deliberate, methodical, and occasionally infuriating. The Cubs? They’re the “go big or go home” crowd, which, in baseball, often means going home *empty-handed*.

1mc8e36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mc8e36,Seeking advice on display coffee table,"Hey everyone! This seems like a great community and I'm quite the noob in woodworking, but I love making stuff. In the past I acquired a rather large lego set (colosseum) and I was thinking of building a coffee table - display case hybrid, as lots of people have done with a certain star wars set.

I have included my rough Blender sketches of what I would like it to look like and its measurements (I hope this is okay!). I want to keep it quite basic, I simply want it to be able to support itself and any objects placed on top, naturally.

In terms of materials, I was thinking of using \~3cm x 3cm pine wood for the beams making up the main structure, 5mm thick plexiglas/ acrylic sheets for the sides and top and some type of wooden plank(s) for the bottom. I plan on using my dremel with a routing attachment to add 0,5-1 cm deep grooves  for the plexiglas sheets at around \~1,5 cm from the edges of the bottom plank, and in the middle of all the beams. I also plan to use it to add the chamfers.

Since I am quite inexperienced and have a bunch of questions, I figured I'd ask them here!

\- Would \~3x3 cm beams of pine wood suffice?  
\- What do you recommend for the bottom plank(s)? Right now I haven't incorporated any supports and to keep all dimensions similar I have gone for 3 cm in height, but again, this is just a rough sketch. The object I want inside is slightly smaller than the bottom (59x52 cm oval) weighing around 10 kgs.  
\- If you have any experience with plexiglas, should I allow the sheets some 'breathing room' within all the grooves for temperature changes, etc.? If yes, is there a way to incorporate this without having the sheets be too loose?  
\- I would prefer not showing too many screws, do you have any recommendations for how to connect all the beams and structures (other than a bunch of wood glue)?

I'm happy to recieve any other feedback and/ or recommendations you may have, thanks in advance!",3,1753786873.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

I'm thinking specifically about the ""seed to soul"" concept, which sounds simple, but encompasses everything from lasting agriculture and ethical sourcing to the actual impact a product has on our well-being.

Trying to navigate this can feel overwhelming. As an example, when choosing coffee, it's easy to just grab a bag off the shelf. but understanding the process – where the beans came from, how the farmers were treated, and whether the roasting process preserved (or destroyed) beneficial compounds – suddenly makes that simple purchase a lot more involved.

I've found that searching ELI5 for terms like ""fair trade"" or ""regenerative agriculture"" can break down these complex systems into understandable pieces. It's still a learning process, of course, but it’s much less intimidating than trying to decipher jargon-heavy articles and documentaries. It makes me wonder what other seemingly simple concepts are actually far more complex than we realize, and how ELI5 can help unpack them.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Douglas Lamotte. Quality Manager at Pinecliffe Systems.**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] April 16, 2137**

I’ve been up and gone since the asscrack of dawn. I gaze out across the dimly lit parking lot of a familiar hell. The Rocky Mountain Mixed-Security Xeno Correctional Center once again has me in its shadow, but this time I’m not here for work. In fact, I’ll never ever be in there for work again.

***Thank God.***

The thermos is cold in my hands, but the acrid coffee is oh so warm inside. I take another long drag off the steaming beverage as I watch a suspicious bus pull into the visitor parking lot not far away from me. A gaggle of humans of all ages pours out, and I even see a Venlil or two in their midst. They pop open the storage on the sides and pull out bundles of posters, flaring anxiety that strikes me right in the heart.

>**Keep them locked up.**

>**No amnesty for war criminals.**

>**Our planet, Our Safety**

*Son of a bitch. I knew they’d show up.*

I watch with burning eyes as the protestors line up near the guest and prisoner release entrance in the prison lot. Their purpose is not challenging to figure out: they want Wynef to stay inside indefinitely for being a part of the Extermination Fleet. I chuckle at the absurdity of keeping the girl locked up forever for something that she didn’t even have a choice in, but at the same time, I can’t find it in myself to be more than just a little annoyed at the demonstration. I have no doubts that these people all lost loved ones in the attempted genocide.

*Everyone lost someone, but I’m not sure this is the right target, folks.*

Then an equally unexpected series of vans arrives, and quickly all of the occupants pour out and rush over to the first group with a tension I feel I could cut with a knife. The anti-release protestors go quiet before bursting into even more chaos as the second group verbally clashes with them. The newcomers don’t have any signs, but I can hear their message loud and clear:

**“No punishments for slaves. No offenses for children.”**

*I’m glad they showed; I would feel a bit lonely to be the only Wynef supporter here.*

As I watch the two rival groups’ energies and tempers flare up and then fade down, back and forth, I get a ring on my pad, and I quickly open up my messenger to see a text from Callum.

>*Hey Doug, I’m with her, and she just got the last of her things from inventory. We’re heading back to the loading dock right now.*

A smile emerges on my face as I set my coffee into the cupholder and reply to Callum as fast as I can.

>*Awesome, I’ll be over in 10 seconds.*

I put my pad away and dial the truck into drive. I slowly creep away to not draw interest from the protest as I go around the facility to the loading docks in the back, where the food delivery truck is rather busy dropping off the day’s supplies. At the bottom of the stairs near the dock’s edge, I spot Callum, and standing beside him is an extremely fidgety Wynef. She seems to be a bundle of nerves as she shifts her weight on her hooves and rubs her hands against each other and the canvas bag she’s holding. I park the truck and step out to greet the pair.

“Good morning, Callum! I heard that your job search is going well.”

He dryly chuckles before slowly breaking out into a real smile and laugh.

“Doug, don’t even get me started. You don’t know how jealous I was when you told me you were getting out of here, and look at you now, you look a whole decade younger!”

“Hey there, sonny, what are you getting at?”

“I’m getting at that you’re old, old man. Anyway, see you around, Doug; I have to get back inside. Bye or whatever, Wynef.”

As he goes back into prison, I walk towards Wynef and hold out my hand as I reach for her bag. She stares at my hand for a moment and pulls in on herself, drawing her hands close to her body.

“Pred—uh, Douglas, w-what are you doing?”

“I was about to offer to carry and load your bag for you.”

“O-oh, sorry. T-thank you.”

I watch with a tiny smile as she releases the tightness in her shoulders and flicks her ear as she extends the bag out towards me. I hear a trembling breath escape her as I turn back to the truck with her bag and take a quick peek inside, only to discover her books, the chess set, and what I guess is her old holopad. 

*Son of a bitch, this is it? This is all she has to her name? Her pad and then the things I got her?*

After I place it in the back seat, I open the passenger door and let her step inside before closing it behind her and going back over and hopping in the driver’s seat. The hydrogen motor whines as I circle and start to head out from behind the prison.

“D-Douglas, where is your mate Angie? I—I thought you had said she’d be here to pick me up with you?”

“Ah, sorry, Wynef, Angie got stuck with an emergency meeting for work. With the war now over, the company’s production is all uncertain, as we were mostly producing war materials. We’re now trying to shift to rebuilding and aid production for any and all war-torn areas. Mainly Earth…we still need some help on the home front.”

“T-that makes sense. I-I was just… I wanted to meet her.”

*That’s pretty sweet. Angie will be very excited to hear that one.*

“Oh, don’t you worry; you’ll meet her when we get home later.”

As we pull around and back to the visitor’s lot, I see the protestors and counter-protestors *somehow* haven’t come to an agreement and started hugging and making up yet. I watch out of the corner of my eye as Wynef’s hands go for the handles on the dashboard and A-pillar as she sees the mass of frustrated people. 

*Please, please, please, don’t upset her too much…*

“W-what are all of those humans a-and Venlil here for?”

“You, unfortunately. Not everyone is thrilled that you are getting out with less than a year of time served.”

“So if they want me to stay in there, I’m guessing the other group wants me dead…”

“Dead? Oh no, the other group of all humans thinks that you should have never gone to prison. They want all press-ganged soldiers and children that were in the Extermination Fleet to be freed.”

“Really? They… Well, I guess I’m fortunate that they are here to divert the others and not notice me leaving from the back.”

“Yeah, fortunate. It’d be crazy if this was all planned out.”

Wynef flicks her ears and bobs her head in agreement before I watch her slowly turn an eye over to me, and her jaw drops.

“D-Douglas?! You organized the distraction so they wouldn’t see us?”

“Organized is a strong word; more like sent an anonymous tip about location and time.”

“T-thank you.”

“Of course.”

*Not like I’d let them gang up on you as we exit. You’re already going through it; no need for more strain.*

As we pull out onto the main road, I engage the auto-drive and let the truck drive itself towards the ever-wonderful I-25. I take this chance to actually get a good look at Wynef just to see if anything has changed in the weeks since I’ve last seen her. Her belly has certainly gotten noticeably bigger, as well as her chest. Very apparent are new bands of gold and silver on her wrists and one thin golden chain around her neck with a blue gem. The fur beneath them also looks much thicker and shinier.

*Honestly, she looks a hundred times better than just two weeks ago. Maybe just knowing what’s going to happen has her more well-rested? Eh, doubt it. The jewelry is interesting, though.*

Wynef notices my gaze and looks over at me with confusion before terror takes her eyes. Her eyes dart around, and she tries to say something as she points in front of us, but only squeaks come out. Finally, she is able to choke out a horrified sob.

“D-Douglas! The road! You have to watch the road!”

*Oh! Right, they don’t have self-driving. Fuck, that should’ve been said.*

“No, no, Wynef, this is a self-driving vehicle. Watch.”

The truck slowly comes to a stop and then patiently waits at the light on the busy overpass before making a turn and getting on the on-ramp for I-25. I exaggerate by lifting my hands far off of the steering wheel as the truck readily accelerates and merges into spaced traffic on the interstate. Wynef slowly calms down, and even her death grip on the handles loosens before completely releasing and dropping her hands to her lap.

*Damn, this should be hilarious, but it’s really not…*

“So, Wynef, you never said you had such nice jewelry. Are those real gold and silver?”

“Yes, it’s all gold and silver with a few small gems encrusted. They’re an heirloom set from mother to first daughter, going back for many generations. It’s the last thing I have from either of my parents since Ulimtal…”

*Since it was all blown to high hell or looted by cannibal lizards, got it.*

“Well, if it’s any consolation, it’s a beautiful set of jewelry and looks very lovely on you. I’m sure your mother would have gushed over you wearing it. Your parents, are they the only family you had?”

“They never talked about their parents or if they had any siblings or cousins. In fact, Ittel was nearly forbidden from being mentioned. I—I never got the chance to listen to them explain why before the first raid. Oh, hey Douglas, I believe you had said you lived in the mountains; why are we driving away from them?”

“Ah, hell, I forgot to tell you, we had to have your appointments I mentioned moved up to today, so we’re going to Denver to the hospital.”

“T-that’s alright, I guess…”

“Sorry, Wynef, I know you probably wanted to get somewhere to finally have a second of alone time and space to yourself. I hope we won’t be too long today.”

*I can’t even imagine how nice a warm shower and a clean bed would be after that long in the can…*

The time passes relatively swiftly as the sun has long since crested and now hangs precariously above the eastern plains. Wynef spends most of the journey staring in awe at the perfectly spaced and synchronized cars as they all pass at appropriate speeds and take themselves on and off the highway. As we approach the rather unremarkable skyline of Denver, I catch Wynef abruptly bringing her hands to her belly and jerking forward.

*Hmm, maybe the little thing got in a good kick on her?*

“Wynef, are you feeling alright?”

“Yes, yes, I’m fine. It… ***the kit*** is just putting pressure on my lungs, which is rather unpleasant. And it presses o-on my intestines; it makes me…gassy.”

*Oh my, poor girl is going blue.*

“Hah, no worries, Wynef, do what you need to do to be comfortable; just let me know so I can take a deep breath first and roll down the window.”

Her face somehow turns an even brighter blue, and I laugh at myself as I imagine the red-hot scolding I’d be receiving from Angie if she were with us right now. I nearly catch Wynef’s ears flapping as maybe, just maybe, she finds it a bit funny as well.

*Of course it’s funny. Farts are always funny.*

Finally, the truck takes us off I-25 and routes us right into the parking lot of the hospital. Faster than I can even see an open spot, it’s already backing us in and has put itself in park near the doors to the doctor’s offices. I step out and quickly come around the truck and open Wyenf’s door and help support her as she shakily steps out onto the concrete. Her hooves *click-clack* as we pass through the sliding doors and down the hall to the maternity ward. I spot the correct room number on the wall and hold open the door for Wynef as she teeters in before me.

“Douglas, what do I do now? How do human doctors work? A-are they like ***her***?”

“Her? Oh, you mean Karbach? No, these doctors are much kinder than Karbach and will stay that way as long as you’re… *respectful*. Just take this chip and tell the receptionist up there you are here for an appointment and answer all of her questions. The insurance info is on that chip; just swipe to scan and load. Also, the main doctor and nurses in this office are now Zurulian with human assistants. Good luck, Wynef.”

I sit down and watch as Wynef trembles and stutters while talking with the exceedingly understanding receptionist. She doesn’t even have a moment of waiting time, as she is immediately called back by a Zurulian nurse as soon as she finishes her pre-exam forms. I smile and go to my pad to update Angie on, well, everything.

>*Hey hon, just sat down at the Dr’s office. They got her back pretty much instantly.*

>***Oh good! How did pickup and everything go? She feeling alright?***

>*Pro- and anti-release got caught up in each other as expected, so we got out easy. Wynef is even bigger than I last saw her; she said her belly hurts and short of breath.*

>***Poor girl! I swear Sophie gave me IBS the entire way through. Hope it’s not that bad for her. See you in a few hours?***

>*Maybe longer. I think she’s going to need some things to cover up with around town. Love you.*

>***Get her something nice, our treat. Love you too.***

Just as I finish reading Angie’s text, I glance up as the door opens again and a human nurse steps out and immediately makes eye contact with me.

“Douglas? Wynef is requesting that you come and sit with her for the next part of the exam.”

*Ah, fuck me. Is she freaking out over humans? Or maybe they’re nervous about her being part of the fleet? Fuck, this can’t be good.*

“Oh, sure thing. Follow you, I guess?”

I stand up and quickly pace across the room and accompany the nurse down the office hall. We stop in front of a room, and the nurse raps their knuckles across the door. I hear Wynef’s voice respond from within.

“I-I, uh, come in?”

The nurse opens the door, and I step in to find Wynef lying reclined on an examination chair with a small Zurulian staring at a pad while pushing a wand up to her belly and making circles in the fur. Wynef’s arm is covered in a set of band-aids and wraps as she has her hands gripping the armrests of the chair. Wynef looks right at me before taking a hand and pointing at the chair beside her. I come to her side and take a seat in the chair while giving a timid smile to her.

“How’s it going, Wynef? I see you got a whole load of shots, huh?”

“There… there were a lot of vaccinations for the kit. I don’t think I’ll be encountering many of my kind on this planet, but I agreed that it wouldn’t be prudent to take risks like that.”

*That’s very thoughtful. Maybe a sign she’s feeling okay towards the baby?*

“So, the nurse said you wanted me in here?”

""Yes! Nurse Rudar asked if I had come with anyone and if they would like to view the fetal scan. I said that you might want to see it. Was I correct?”

*Getting to view a baby alien growing? Hell yeah.*

“Of course! If you want me here, I’m glad to do so.”

As I redirect my attention from Wynef to the Zurulian nurse, I see them turn to me and give a flick of their teddy bear ears and a wave from their hand.

“Hello, Mister Douglas! I’m Nurse Rudar. I’m not the primary physician’s assistant here, but it’s been a fantastic experience to assist so many non-human people here on Earth. Anyway, now that I have everything set up, Wynef, are you prepared to see the images?”

Wynef lightly adjusts in the chair as she looks at me for what I’m guessing is some form of request for affirmation. I give her a quick nod and a smile, and she turns back to the nurse.

“Y-yes, please show the image.”

With Wynef’s approval, Nurse Rudar switches the pad to projection mode, and the 3D ultrasound casts to the far wall. Clear as day in the image is a curled-up form slowly moving its arms and legs while two big ears are wrapped around it. A small tail extends out the back of the little thing. Wynef’s ears go back and lock in place as she tilts her head side to side at the projection. Nurse Rudar activates a virtual pointer and begins highlighting different parts of the feed.

“I’m sure you’re wondering what we’re looking at here, correct? Well, these walls are the inside boundaries of your uterus, and this huddled figure is the fetus, your pup. I can clearly see that development is going along well, and there are no visual deformities on any of the bone structures or soft tissues. Do you wish to know the sex of the fetus?”

*Oh, just like that? Are gender reveals a thing in Nevok society? Maybe they have something similar where-*

“What sex is it?”

“From the features here, the fetus appears to be a female.”

“A girl? Huh…”

I look over at Wynef and give a squeeze to her tense hand on the armrest.

“Glad to hear she’s in good health, Wynef.”

“Yeah… It… It's so strange to see it like this but also feel it inside. The projection is… a bit intimate… something that’s been happening day after day since I’ve been on Earth.”

*And you’re only just now getting to come to terms with it. Fuck…*

Nurse Rudar tenses up as Wynef parses through the depiction. He quietly shuts off the projection and turns his attention to Wynef directly.

“So, Wynef, uh, would you like to keep a copy of the scan on a personal device so you can view it at home?”

Wynef remains in a blank stupor as she lazily flicks an ear at the nurse.

“O-okay, but I didn’t bring my pad with me inside. Douglas, can you download it for me?”

“For sure. Here, nurse.”

As I hand my pad off and the scan is transferred, I keep a close watch on Wynef, who seems enamored with her belly as she taps her fingers across the surface. She jumps a bit as I reach my hand out to take back my pad from Nurse Rudar, who then takes a clean wipe and removes the gel from her belly before hopping down and standing beside Wynef.

“So Wynef, that’s all the checkup will be covering today. Everything looks to be in order. If anything feels *off* or suddenly changes, please do not hesitate to come in immediately. Wynef, Douglas, have a good day.”

*Did she get any of that? I’m not sure she’s even with us right now.*

“You too… nurse…”

As Nurse Rudar escorts us out of the office, I take a quick moment to stand with Wynef as the next appointment is scheduled, and soon enough, we are on our way back out to the truck. Wynef stumbles side to side as we walk, and I frequently have to right her before she falls over into me. She only barely makes it into the truck as I open the door and help her back up and in. I set our next destination and let the truck do its magic as I investigate the lethargic Wynef.

“Hey, Wynef, are you feeling alright?”

“My arm sort of hurts.”

*No shit, that’s a lot of shots there.*

“That’s expected, but I meant, are you ***feeling*** alright?”

“I-it’s… It’s just an awful lot. I don’t know how to feel about, well, anything.”

“Wynef, if you need to talk to someone about how you are feeling, you can certainly come to Angie or me, but you also have access to a therapist under our insurance. Would you like something like that?”

“A therapist?”

*Yeah, another one I should’ve seen coming.*

“A professional that helps you parse through your feelings and gets you in a better state of mind.”

“That sounds like a PD specialist, but… I-I think I might need something like that.”

“I assure you, they’re nothing like those PD electrocutioners; this will just be a straightforward online video or voice call however often you need it. We can get the first one scheduled after dinner tonight?”

“T-thank you, Douglas… There’s really a kit developing inside of me, isn’t there?”

“Yes, there is. Angie said that it was a realization that stunned her both times.”

“Every movement, every jolt. I—it’s a real kit just… ***inside*** of me. Inside… of ***me.*** Living, growing, feeling… ***Stars***… Can I see the scan on your pad again?”

I open up the downloaded scan and pass my pad over to Wynef as the truck turns off of I-25 North and onto the ever-busy 36 West. I keep a side-eye on Wynef as she continuously wrings her hands and switches between looking at the scan and watching the other vehicles race around on the streets of Denver. A set of semis does a standard close pass, and Wynef gasps but is just as shocked when they don’t collide.

“D-Douglas, how long have humans had this type of robot driving?”

“Oh, about one hundred years or so?”

“That long… We don’t have anything like this anywhere, I don’t think. And we tried to bomb it all away...”

*That ‘we’ is carrying a lot of weight there. Might not want to refer to BoE that way.*

“Yeah… It’s a lot safer. On the bright side, we can now export this technology to the entire Sapient Coalition.”

“Yeah… Anyway, are we going to your home now?”

*Oh Lord, I wish. Anything from Angie’s cooking would do wonders for the sanitizer smell in my nose.*

“Not quite. We have to make one more stop at a shopping mall on the way.”

“Shopping? What for?”

“Clothes…’

“Oh, I guess humans have to buy their pelts from somewhere.”

“Clothes for you.”

“For me?”

“For you.”

“Oh Stars, why?”

“Wynef, humans wear clothes for many reasons, but one of the main ones is that we are a bit more… ***exposed*** below, if you get what I mean. Women commonly wear tops for the same reason, but what I’m getting at is that as you develop in your pregnancy, you’ll be more exposed in the same way, and Angie and I thought it’d be a good idea for you to have your own outfits. You don’t have to if you don’t want to, and we can head home?”

“Y-you think that human men w-will look at me t-that way?”

*Most certainly, I’m afraid. Other guards at the prison weren’t super subtle.*

“Yes, Nevok are a lot more human-shaped than most other races.”

“D-Douglas, d-do you l-look at me t-that way?”

“No, my attention is all and only for Angie, but I can’t say the same for all men.”

“I—I think I’ll get some pelts then. C-can you please help me pick some out?”

“For sure.”

As the truck pulls into the mall, I again assist Wynef out of her seat, but I can’t help but notice that she has regressed just a bit in her comfort around me. My mind bites at itself for mentioning the attention from human men, but it struggles to come up with any reasonable way to dance around it. In the mall, I act as an offensive lineman, pushing through the openly gawking crowd as I lead Wynef through the busy walkways and over to the secondhand store within. The teen girl manning the checkout desk nearly spit-takes her drink as she jumps up and rushes over to greet us. She makes no effort to not stare Wynef down as Wynef moves to cower behind me, and the teen’s face falls.

“Oh, oh! S-sorry, I-I didn’t mean to stare like that. Welcome inside; if there’s anything you need help with, don’t hesitate to ask.”

I turn around to peek at Wynef, who is cautiously easing out from behind my protection to face the teen for herself. I make a step to the side and expose Wynef to the task of public conversation.

*She’s going to have to get used to this quickly, and this is as easy of an intro course as I can imagine.*

“Douglas says I need to cover up if I wish to avoid men’s attention.”

The girl’s eyes go into a fiery glare right into my heart, and I let my head sink to my chest with pursed lips. I think I hear the employee ***growl*** at me as I look up to see her grabbing at Wynef’s hand, who promptly snaps it back and dashes behind me again. The girl’s rage subsides, and she goes back to confusion as I quickly try to think of an explanation for all of this.

“Sorry, Wynef here is newer to Earth and isn’t very keen on receiving attention, especially given her condition. My wife and I thought that she could have some control over that with some clothing. She’s staying with us in Estes Park, so some colder-weather things would be appropriate.”

“Oh, so you are pregnant!? That’s so exciting! Follow me; we have some sweaters that you’d look *adorable* in and blend right in up there!”

Wynef hesitates to follow, but I give her a nudge on her shoulder, and she stumbles forward, but not without providing me another death glare to match the earlier one from the employee. We are led back to an extensive rack of winter clothes marked down on account of the upcoming summer. Unfortunately, my bad habit of my eyes glazing over during shopping trips with my girls takes up even now, and I barely notice until Wynef starts to sort through the selections on her own with the employee gushing over each and every jacket and sweater. What really gets my attention is when Wynef pulls out a very revealing green sleeveless, open-back sweater and suddenly freezes in place.

“Oh, Miss Wynef, that is ***sooo*** cute!”

*There’s no way Wynef is in love with that type of sweater….*

“H-hey Wynef, that might be a bit more… open than it seems. Maybe it’s not-”

The two girls whip their eyes to me and produce double stares that each individually would kill me if they could. I raise my hands in defeat and step back as Wynef takes it off of the hanger, and with a little help from the employee, she gets it on and adjusted. Surprisingly, it ***does*** cover up her breasts and everything below, and while it doesn’t do much for warmth, she does have very thick arm, back, and neck fur. The employee is nearly dancing in place as Wynef does a spin in front of the mirror

“Ooooooh, Wynef, that is the ***cutest!*** Do you like it?”

“I—I think this fits very well. D-do you think it will keep fitting as I-I…”

“So you aren’t full term yet? Is it twins or triplets?”

“J-just one kit.”

“Kit? That’s what you call your babies! Oh, you should be fine if they grow to anything like human baby size! We have more if you want other colors too?”

Wynef looks over to me with a silent request for approval, and I nod my head at the girls and respond.

“We’ll take whatever. Throw in some regular hoodies and shirts, and we’ll be good to go, I think?”

“Oh, do you need a bra as well?”

Wynef’s hands drop to her side as she stares down the girl.

“A bra?”

“The thing that we use to hold up our breasts. Unless you don’t care?”

Wynef reaches her hands up to her chest and then again raises her ears at me for advice, but I find myself as lost as her. Taking the enthusiasm from the employee, I give my blessing again.

“Sure, get her whatever might fit, and then if she likes them, my wife can take her shopping for some later.”

“You are so lucky we got some nice ones in the other day. Meet me at the counter, and I'll get all of this ready for you!”

Wynef and I click-clack over to the counter, and the girl quickly does another loop of the store before rushing up with arms full of clothes. She scans through them all like a tornado, and I watch in silent, emotionless horror as the number on the payment screen accelerates up like a spaceship taking off. The only one not scanned is the one Wynef is wearing, so she grudgingly leans in to be scanned before the tag is cut, and I see it's finally time to swipe my pad for payment. With that all done, I take the bag full of clothes and thank the employee one last time as we exit back into the mall. 

If the stares before were bad, the ones now are somehow possibly worse. The novelty of an alien girl in human clothes has just about everyone of all ages stealing glances, but they’re not as intense as they were before.

*Okay, maybe bad at first, but this is the type of attention that is temporary, and folks will get used to it. Not like before, when men were openly gawking and trying to catch bigger looks.*

Again, I part the seas of people who have stopped to stare, and we exit the mall none too soon as I look back to see Wynef literally trembling in place as her ears and eyes dart around the parking lot. I quickly usher her into the truck and pull it off to a virtually empty side of the parking lot. Her clench on the handlebars of the truck slowly relaxes as she takes a few glances at me. I hear her breath come back down to a typical pace before she grunts at me.

“Douglas, why aren’t we leaving?”

“You looked like you were about to have a panic attack, and I want you to feel okay before I take you up the mountain highway.”

Her anger instantly fades as she sinks back, deep into the seat.

“I-I… thank you, but I think I’m ready to lie down now. This is the longest I’ve been without a nap since I was captured.”

*Good point, growing a baby is rough work, and I’ve had you running around all day.*

“At this rate, it’s getting late enough to where I think your nap will end up just being going to bed. Anyway, let’s get home.”

I get the truck moving again, and we hop back on 36 West towards Estes Park. Wynef relaxes more as the highway necks down to 2 lanes and we break into the valleys and canyons. Her panic comes back just a bit as we hover near the edges of canyon cliffs on the highway, but I ready myself for her reaction to the reveal of the city when we crest the final bend.

As the truck regenerates on the steep downslope, we pass the welcome sign, and the entirety of the reservoir and mountain valley view appears before us. Wynef makes an authentic ‘woah’ as the stunning snowcapped mountains and glistening river shine at us with the sun starting to set behind the continental divide.

“Wynef, welcome to Estes Park.”

“I—I-it’s beautiful, Douglas. This is just how Mom and Dad described Ittel. I didn’t think humans would like living like this.”

“Oh, I don’t just *like* living up here; ***I love it***. We’ll be home in just a bit; hope you’re hungry.”

“H-hungry? I-it w-won’t be meat, right?”

“Lord, Wynef, no. Fresh bread and cooked greens. Angie and I will be on supplements to not eat meat for a bit until you’re more comfortable.”

Her head drops to her chest as she grips the side of her new sweater.

*A member of the Extermination Fleet saddened because humans aren’t eating meat. What a wild time.*

“Y-you’re going to go hungry because of me?”

“Hungry? No, Angie and I will be more than fine. We love our fruit and veggies.”

“Okay then…”

Just on the other side of town, the truck pulls off into my subdivision and ascends the hill up to the house. Right at the bottom of the driveway, the truck slows down and stops right next to the mailbox. Wynef tilts her head to the side and wobbles her ears around right as I am about to open the door and grab the mail.

“Douglas, why are we stopped in front of a primitive mansion?”

*Primitive? Isn’t that a slur for them?*

“Primitive mansion? Wynef, this is ***my*** house.”

“Why is it made of wood? I thought humans had more advanced materials than this?”

“I assure you, it is very modern in its equipment. Angie and I just like the look of wood.”

“Y-you have heat and cooling and plumbing, correct?”

*Okay, one hundred percent using it as a slur.*

“Y-yes! We do in fact have indoor plumbing, both hot and cold, as well as forced air heating and cooling. Just hold on one second while I get the mail.”

Shaking my head in disbelief but also amusement at Wynef thinking we lived like pioneers, I pop open the mailbox and quickly find myself excited at what’s inside. A small package is within, and I read the label with a sigh of relief as it’s exactly what I hoped to find. I step back into the truck and open the package on my lap while Wynef watches curiously beside me. Inside are two pink booties with Velcro straps to fit exactly as snug as desired to a pony’s hoofs.

“Are those hoof covers? Douglas, are those for me?”

“Yes, they are! I had hoped to have these ready for you before I picked you up today, but they were delayed. Sorry, but we are a bit worried about you scuffing our floors with your hoofs. Here, try them on.”

I let the truck pull up and into the now open garage as Wynef awkwardly tries to bend over her belly and put on the hoof covers. After a few grunts, groans, and minor curses, she has them secured and is tapping her hoofs against the floorboard to make sure they are snug. I get out of the truck and grab her belongings bag and new clothes as she huffs and puffs getting out against the tight wall of the narrow garage.

“So, do those feel alright on your hooves?”

“They certainly feel strange, but not uncomfortable. I… actually might like them, even the color.”

“Oh good! Well, without further ado, it’s time for you to meet Angie, unpack your things, and then we can have some dinner.”

Wynef closes her eyes and takes a quivering breath as I am barely able to open the door with my full hands. The second the door clicks open, I hear a faint squeal, and a huge smile overtakes my face. The sound of an office chair being thrown backwards is heard, followed by rapid but restrained running across the house. Just as Wynef slowly follows me inside, I see Angie rush around the corner and stare us down with one of the bigger smiles I have seen on her in a while.

“***Ooooooh***, Wynef! Welcome home, honey! I’m Angie, Dougie’s wife. Nice to meet you!”

Wynef takes a few rapid breaths but is able to will herself to pass by me and bow in front of Angie. Angie scoffs and looks at me as Wynef straightens up with a groan and a hand clutching her belly.

“T-thank you for the treats you have made for me and for allowing me in your house despite my… *condition*. Also, did you call Douglas, Dougie? I’ve heard other humans call him Doug, but I was not aware that he had a third name.”

“Oh honey, you don’t have to bow at me like you owe a debt; I baked you those things because I ***wanted to*** after what Dougie said about you stuck all alone over in that wing of the prison. Dougie probably didn’t tell you about his other name because only I use it, but one thing he could’ve told me is how tall you are! My, I didn’t expect you to be taller than me, not even counting the ears!”

“W-well, the covers I put on are making me taller than I am.”

“Oh please, you’d still be taller. For some reason, I assumed most bipedal aliens were maxed out at five feet; you’re nearly as tall as Dougie! Anyway, let’s go downstairs to your space so we can get back up here and started on dinner.”

Wynef and I, with my arms tired of lugging everything, descend the stairs, and I watch Wynef startle as the lights flick on to the downstairs living room with the small kitchenette in the corner. I quickly go and enter her bedroom and set her things on the freshly made bed before rejoining them in the open space. Angie is pointing to the various areas as Wynef watches with her head hanging ominously low.

“So this is the downstairs living room; you can hook up your pad on the projector there and use the couches however you like. Over there is the kitchenette where you can make small meals if you don't want to go all the way upstairs and use the main kitchen. Over here is your bathroom; we had a fur dryer installed for you. Finally, this is your bedroom and closet; I see Dougie got you some clothes. We’ll get you unpacked; in the meantime, take a look around and let me know of anything you might need. Of course, you are welcome to use anything upstairs at any time; I only ask you don’t wander around our bedroom and bathroom.”

“T-Thank you, Angie.”

I flick my hand to shoo Wynef away to look around the basement as Angie and I start to unpack her things across the bedroom and closet. Clothes on the hangers, books on the shelf, bras in the dresser, pad on the charger. As we go, I catch glimpses of Wynef navigating the room, sitting on the couches, and going through the cabinets. Eventually, as we are nearly done and ready to grab Wynef to go back upstairs for dinner, the bunny girl herself comes into the bedroom. She spins in place at the open closet filled with her clothes, the bookshelf with her things, and her pad on the nightstand before tears start filling her eyes and she turns right towards us. She begins to choke out a few words as Angie and I freeze in place.

“I’m having a very, ***very*** strange day. H-humans give hugs, right?”

Even before Angie can react, I throw out the obvious.

“Of course we do, Wynef. Would you like a hug?”

“Y-yes, please.”

In a flash, Angie and I cross the room and embrace Wynef in a tight hug as she slowly leans her weight into us and her knees buckle, us supporting her as we sink to the floor. I rub small circles into the girl’s back, and Angie strokes her head while she cries harder and harder, barely drawing ragged, shallow breaths. I catch Angie’s attention for a second as she grimaces, shakes her head, and goes back to pulling Wynef’s face into us.

*Oh Wynef, you poor girl. I don’t know if this is your home for all too long, but we’ll take the best care of you we can. I wonder what Jacob and Sophie will think when they visit? Ah, get there when we get there.*

1mc8dah,https://i.redd.it/ojt269akosff1.png,"""Privacy needs to be baked into L1"" - Frank Braun","""Privacy is the absence of information leakage and that implies it comes from value at rest, not value in motion. And privacy at rest can only be gained in a meaningful way by baking it into L1, not by adding it to higher layers.

That's a bold claim, so lets dig into it step by step.

Privacy is the absence of information leakage

Privacy is not the presence of some mysterious quality, but the absence of information leakage. This is best understood if you look at the opposite of the term private — public. If some information is public then anybody can potentially access that that information. If some information is only known to a restricted group of people, then that information can still potentially be accessed by people outside of that group.

In the digital realm nothing can be taken back. If I send you a digital picture, I still have it. I also can never control with certainty where this picture will end up afterwards.

""The only true secret is the one you take to the grave.""

— Anonymous

If you want to keep a secret, don't share it with anybody. If you share a secret with only one person and it becomes publicly known afterwards, you know who broke secrecy, but you cannot make it a secret again. If you share a secret with only two people and it becomes publicly known afterwards, you cannot even know anymore with certainty who broke secrecy, and you certainly cannot take it back. If you try to censor leaked information from the internet you will most likely become a victim of the Streisand effect.

From a threat model perspective, it's best to assume that any information that is shared with anybody will become public knowledge.

Therefore, the only way to ""gain"" privacy is by not sharing information in the first place.

That is, privacy is the absence of information leakage.

Privacy comes from value at rest, not value in motion

If you have a store of value (SoV) with perfect privacy — no information is leaked while value is stored or moved within the SoV — you only have privacy (no information leakage) while value is stored or moved within such a closed system.

The moment you move value in or out of the perfectly private SoV system, you leak some information and such information can typically be used to to derive more information.

And with the rapid improvements of AI technology it's best to assume that any information that can be derived, will be derived.

As Zooko explained in an interesting thread on X, the best a perfectly private SoV can do is to not leak any information (my wording). Moving money in and out of it will always leak information.

Sending funds into a perfectly private SoV will leak the time and value of the transaction to the public. Sending fund out of perfectly private SoV will also leak the time and value of the transaction to the public.

Using a perfectly private SoV as a mixer won't work, because transactions going in and coming out of it can be correlated both in time and value.

The only way to separate incoming and outgoing transactions is to separate them both in time and in value.

And the only way to do that is to use the perfectly private SoV actually as a store of value — a savings account — where the typical incoming and outgoing transaction is significantly smaller than the total amount of money saved. And an incoming transaction doesn't cause an outgoing transaction and vice versa (that is, there is no time correlation between incoming and outgoing transactions).

That's also the main argument in my Zcash investment thesis why value should accrue to privacy coins, if (and only if) the market demands more monetary privacy and understands this dynamic, but that's not the topic of this post.

Saving is not only necessary for capital accumulation, it's also a necessity for monetary privacy (unless you stay strictly within the perfectly private SoV).

Only the wealthy can afford to use non private payment systems with a certain assurance of privacy (as described above). If you don't have the necessary capital for a decently sized ""private savings account"" you have to strictly transact within the perfectly private SoV and never leave it in order to have monetary privacy.

That means, if you want to spread monetary privacy to everybody, the best way to do that is to onboard wealthy people with the use case of private SoV and not yet wealthy people with the use case of medium of exchange (MoE) in a circular economy.

Privacy needs to be part of the base layer

Privacy is the absence of information leakage and that implies it comes from value at rest, not value in motion. And privacy at rest can only be gained in a meaningful way by baking it into L1, not by adding it to higher layers.

Now that we have discussed that privacy is the absence of information leakage and that privacy comes from value at rest, not value in motion, let's consider why it has to be baked into Layer 1 (L1), the base layer, of a cryptocurrency.

Before we get into details, here are a few well known examples of cryptocurrencies where privacy is baked into L1: Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR), and Zcash (ZEC).

And here are some well know crypto assets where privacy is not baked into L1: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL).

I consider Decred (DCR) to be an edge case, which sits between these two categories, but for sake of brevity I'm not considering it in more detail here.

I'll explain in more detail below how I came to the distinction between these two categories (baked into L1 and privacy only in higher layers) and why I think that it's fundamental.

Technology has no boundaries

In the category of the privacy coins that I mentioned where privacy is baked into L1, both Litecoin, since the MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB) extension, and Zcash (with both transparent and shielded transactions) cover all three parts (source, private SoV, and destination) of the graphic above. While Monero, with it's private by default design, covers only the middle part (private SoV). I explained in another post why I don't think that this matters for privacy, if you look at it from a different angle.

A great perspective on this (thanks to Nate Wilcox) is to zoom out to the scope of usage, not just ""usage within this technological scope"". For example, when ShapeShift was one of the most popular exchanges (before they were forced by regulators to introduce mandatory KYC), one of the most popular use of it was to exchange Bitcoin or Litecoin (before MWEB got introduced) for either Monero or Zcash and then exchange it back to the original coin, effectively using it as a mixer. This is a great demonstration that the existence of transparent addresses is irrelevant to this use case, and that no technology or service can constrain people's usage of it. It's also a great example that you cannot add privacy to value in motion, as discussed above.

The more successful these technologies are, the more people will use them to cross boundaries — technology, platform, product, social group, etc. That's a lot of the value of money! Boundary crossing. And if people are doing that, then details inside the technology, like optional transparent addresses vs. only shielded pools, are irrelevant. But ""privacy comes from value at rest"" remains relevant and becomes even more relevant.

Let's now look at the fundamental issues why privacy cannot be layered on top of L1 and look at concrete, well known, examples where these issues can be witnessed in the wild.

The problem of fungibility

The less deeply integrated privacy is into L1, the less fungible tokens become.

It's a total non-issue for Monero, because there is only one ""pool"". Zcash has deep integration and it's becoming normalized to use shielded pools, especially now with 19.5% of the circulating ZEC supply being held in shielded pools (increasing) and with wallets like Zashi enforcing that all funds go through the shielded pool.

Litecoin is a bit of a special case, because after it launched in October 2011 it took over 10 years until MWEB was activated in May 2022. This also explains that only \~0.2%, namely 166,871 LTC out of a circulating supply of 76,117,814 LTC are in the MimbleWimble pool, which makes using MWEB on Litecoin more ""suspicious"" than using shielded pools in Zcash. But I expect this situation to improve, with more mobile wallet support being rolled out, Cake Wallet was the first one to release MWEB support just in October 2024.

As a funny side story, Litecoin is only one of five crypto tokens that are fully recognized in DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre), where the regulatory framework specifically prohibits privacy tokens. As it's often the case, crypto moves faster than even the most modern regulators.

But I digress, back on topic: In crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, if a user uses some form of mixer technology in an attempt to increase their privacy this is easily detected by now commonly used chain analysis technology, which makes the coins less fungible. If you don't believe me, try to pass a source-of-funds screening at a modern ""crypto friendly"" bank after you moved your entire stash through a mixer. Good luck. A lot of Bitcoin Maxis will have a rude awaking if they want to buy houses when BTC finally hits $1M and they realize that they listened too much to the ""privacy experts"" on their favorite podcast.

A crypto assets either has normalized privacy, like in Monero or Zcash, or the tokens are simply not fungible.

Of course, your banker could also complain about you using a privacy coin in the first place, that's a valid counterargument. However, we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere I still think it's both better for privacy and on principle to use systems which offer privacy all the time.

What would be more suspicious to you: Somebody using PGP to encrypt their emails (some of the time) or somebody using Signal?

The problem of custody

Besides the problem of fungibility, we also have the problem of custody. As we discussed above, privacy comes from value at rest, not value in motion. And in order to get privacy at rest you need to let your tokens rest. And if they rest in a (somewhat) custodial L2, then long rest periods become a problem, but long rest periods are exactly what you need.

While I cannot possibly give a comprehensive and in-depth review of all privacy technologies for Bitcoin and Ethereum, this is a good point in the story to give an overview of the most important ones and how they relate to the problem of custody.

The various CoinJoin technologies employed in Bitcoin, for example, in Wasabi Wallet and Samourai Wallet (website seized by U.S. law enforcement) are non-custodial, but also provide no privacy at rest. The famous Tornado Cash ""mixer"", employing zero-knowledge proofs in a smart contract on Ethereum, has some privacy at rest, but is non-custodial in nature (the employed smart contracts have no admin keys).

This following is going to get me a lot of hate, but here it comes. The Lightning Network (LN), the Manhattan Project of Bitcoin, was supposed to give us everything we ever wanted for Bitcoin: scalability and privacy, while still staying super decentralized and non-custodial. While being non-custodial (it just requires you to run your own lightning node with a hot wallet, what could possibly go wrong), it requires your wallet to be online in order to receive a payment. As of today there are 3,735.09 BTC locked in lightning channels (source: 1ML), a whopping 0.017786% of the circulating supply.

The top 10 nodes hold \~ 64 % of the advertised channel capacity, with the single largest node (ACINQ) holding \~11 % (source also: 1ML), which is exactly the hub and spoke network topology that early critics of LN predicted. A criticism for which they were viciously attacked by Bitcoin Maxis. As much as one wishes a design to behave in a certain way, technical realities are technical realities and in the end reality always wins.

While it's great to pay for coffee (I really like Phoenix wallet these days), I sincerely doubt that it will get us large scale privacy in Bitcoin, no matter how many bLIPs (Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposals) get activated. Sometimes it's just better to admit that one was climbing the wrong hill of technical complexity.

Let's now consider ecash systems, starting with the single mint design of Cashu.

""Cashu is not the second layer of Bitcoin (or even the third), the pseudonymous author of the Cashu protocol Calle correctly says that the layer must support a sovereign transition to a lower layer in order to qualify for being another layer."" (quoted by Juraj Bednar)

I was one of the authors of the Scrit whitepaper, a federated design that inspired Fedimint, and while the design spreads custody over multiple mints, it's still federated custody.

""Fedimint is a federated custody protocol that complements the Bitcoin monetary protocol and Lightning payments protocol to provide a complete solution to holding, using, and securing Bitcoin at global scale.""

— Obi Nwosu, Co-founder and CEO of Fedi Inc.

While I still think that the various ecash designs, like Cashu and Fedimint, hold great potential for fast, cheap, and private payments I now have sincere doubts about their ability to deliver privacy at scale, mainly due to the incompatibility between custody and value at rest: Their custodial nature (federated in the case of Fedimint) requires the user to monitor them continuously and move funds to different mints, if necessary, which is in conflict with the requirement that privacy comes from value at rest.

The problem of compliance

Which brings us to the final and largest issue with privacy on higher layers, the problem of compliance. Let's go through the same list of technologies and I think the picture will become pretty clear.

In April 2024 zkSNACKs Ltd, the company behind Wasabi Wallet, announced that U.S. citizens and residents were permanently blocked from accessing Wasabi Wallet and its services. And then in June 2024, the company officially shut down its CoinJoin coordinator service, probably to prevent a similar fate to that of Samourai Wallet.

In April 2024, U.S. authorities seized Samourai’s servers and domains and arrested co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, charging them with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business (source: Bitcoin Magazine). They are still awaiting trial, which is set to begin in November 2025.

And it continues with Tornado Cash which was put on the U.S. Treasury’s OFAC black list in August 2023, alleging it facilitated laundering of more than $7B. The protocol’s domain and GitHub repo were taken down, and multiple developers were arrested in the U.S. and Europe. One of the developers, Roman Storm, is currently dragged very publicly through U.S. courts (source: Wikipedia).

There are more examples of mixers, but I think it should be clear by now that mixers are neither advisable for users, due to the lack of privacy at rest, nor for operators, due to ""compliance challenges"", no matter how decentralized the design appears — even if there is no operator!

While the specifics are murky, it's pretty clear that Lightning nodes could be considered money transmitters (MSB) in many cases, which would require corresponding licensing, especially if you hold customer funds or open channels for customers. To the best of my knowledge, this has never been formally brought to court, but the situation could change quickly if the LN would become a major method for ""money laundering"".

Cashu clearly is custodial and Calle is well served to stay pseudonymous. If a single mint would get significant volume it is very clear that the MSB definition would be applied and enforced, similar to more traditional mixers.

Fedi, the company building products on top of Fedimint, the protocol, is branded around supporting communities. While I know elsirion, the main developer behind Fedimint, I have never spoken with him or other people from Fedi about this specific issue and I can only speculate that they are well aware of the compliance challenges revolving around operating a mint federation, which is why a branding and Go-to-Market strategy focused on communities running federations makes total sense to me. I certainly wouldn't want to run a company that runs federated ecash mints itself.

All these examples show that having privacy solutions at higher layers not only poses problems to the necessity for value at rest, but always comes with significant compliance risks, where people regularly go to jail.

It's all fun and games zapping each other on Nostr or paying toy amounts with ecash tokens, but for privacy at scale (certainly above the $1B threshold) anything that even smells like custody or has any form of centralized control becomes a major compliance risk of the ""go to jail"" category.

Cognitive dissonance

A phrase often thrown around in Bitcoin circles is the goal of separating money and state. While I applaud that goal I don't think this goal can be achieved without privacy at scale: Are we really going to separate money and state with the state being able to watch every transaction?

The state has the monopoly of violence and the ability to print money out of thin air is an even better funding method for the state than taxing its citizens, because debasement via money printing is a lot less obvious, and therefore less likely to face opposition, than direct taxation.

Bitcoin currently seems to be in the end stages of institutional adoption and I consider it very unlikely we will see any major privacy upgrades on L1, we can be lucky if we get the necessary quantum upgrades in time, given Bitcoin's ossification.

We need money that cannot be debased to escape inflation. But we need money that cannot be traced to escape confiscation. And as I argued in this post, this can only be achieved by baking privacy into L1.

I think this creates a lot of cognitive dissonance in Bitcoiners. Many of us invested our money and sometimes our entire identity into the project.

Bitcoin is certainly the greatest number go up (NgU) technology ever invented, but at the same time the writing is on the wall: It will not give us monetary freedom and it will certainly not give us the separation of money and state. The process of institutionalization is likely to continue and in the end it will be just another asset, similar to gold, which will be held mostly by large institutions and whose excellent monetary properties will help fund the exact thing a little longer that so many Bitcoiners despise — the state.

Conclusion

I argued that privacy is the absence of information leakage and that implies it comes from value at rest, not value in motion. And that privacy at rest can only be gained in a meaningful way by baking it into L1, not by adding it to higher layers, due to the problems of fungibility, custody, and compliance.

From the three cryptocurrencies mentioned in the beginning that have privacy baked into L1, Litecoin, Monero, and Zcash, only one currently has the necessary perfectly private SoV property — Zcash.

To me going down the Zcash rabbit hole definitely feels like Bitcoin early days again.

I gave a talk at the first Bitcoin conference in London in 2012 about the dangers of Bitcoin being captured by states and banks. Now most of the technical issues in Bitcoin regarding privacy still persist and it's becoming completely institutionalized. Number will go up, sure, but it's not going to give us the freedoms we had hoped for, and it doesn't seem to give us peer-to-peer electronic cash.

In order to succeed with the project of separation of money and state we need privacy at scale and that can only be achieved by baking privacy it into L1. And Zcash already did that with the necessary properties of being a perfectly private SoV — it's the best bet we have.

There will be no third chance, it's now or never.

So let's accept the reality of the situation, get over our cognitive dissonance, and actually built on top of Zcash and use it as a perfectly private SoV and MoE.

Bitcoin will continue to appreciate, but privacy at scale requires a more radical approach.

If you are the type that is convinced by big names, Balaji Srinivasan, Vitalik Buterin and Tyler Winklevoss all recognize the importance of Zcash and it's unique position in the space.

Bitcoin has 3000x the market cap of Zcash, it's not going to falter if we go on a little side quest here — but maybe the main price really awaits us at the bottom of the shielded pool...

Hear me out because I can't stop thinking about AI gift cards. Like, wait, is this a thing? Or is my brain just scrambling the *future* faster than the apps on my phone?

Imagine getting a gift card, right? Standard stuff—thanks Grandma, love you! But what if that shiny rectangle wasn’t just $50 for coffee or game credits? What if it plugged you directly into something powered by AI? Custom stories, tailored playlists, a robot chef that finally nails how you like your breakfast… that’s wild.

Here’s why this has me so excited/confused/low-key wanting to give out a thousand AI gift cards right now:

- Personalized experiences. Genuinely different for everyone. No more fake smile when you get socks for the third year running (sorry Mom).
- What if you could gift access to an AI that, say, writes your friend a chapter a day of a fantasy adventure where *they* are the hero?  
  Guess what: A site like https://goodnovel.org/ is already serving up insane amounts of personalized reading adventure.  
- Maybe you hate cooking and I keep pestering you about meal prep. Whoops, now you get a code to an AI chef—the kind that tells you to add more garlic *before* it tastes bland.
- Want AI-generated artwork of yourself fighting dragons? I need three. So would your cousin who keeps changing her profile picture.

Then, I’m hit with a question: How would privacy work? Would the AI need to know everything about you straight away? Like, “Congrats, here’s your gift! Please upload your soul and fifty selfies to unlock more features!” Is that awkward!?

But let’s just admire for a second—the *potential.*  
Instead of gift cards collecting digital dust, they could open up brand new experiences, almost like secret portals hidden in code.  
You could send someone a digital key that unlocks chapters in their favorite genre—sci-fi, romance, medieval dragons or even personalized stories about them and their cat.  
Need proof? Seriously, check out https://goodnovel.org/ for a taste of what’s already out there.

*I’m picturing a future where we send AI gift cards as birthday presents and people actually scream with happiness.*

Nothing wrong with a classic Starbucks card, but if you could open up a future instead of a venti latte, would you go for it?

Have any of you seen AI gift cards out in the wild? What would you want from yours? Would you use it for stories, art, fancy chatbots, songs made just for you?  
Or is plugging an AI into gift giving just… *too much*?

I’m dying to know if you’re as confused/excited as I am.  
Let’s talk!  
And if you want to see what AI custom gifting might *already* be like, definitely peek at https://goodnovel.org/—seriously, your imagination might just get a recharge.

1. Sleep and have your morning or afternoon planned out- I normally fall asleep at around 2-4am as i go on my phone a lot at night so I want to bed at 10am ready for my test at 10:14 am and it improved my focus so much, I also had my clothes ready and I had 2 bananas with some cereal and a tiny bit of coffee so just being overall prepared for the day really helped

2. Utilise your doom scrolling - Lets be honest, you me everyone pretty much scrolls through social media all day so why not follow driving accounts on whatever you use (instagram tiktok youtube). To be fair I did loads and loads of preparation, watched DGN, clearview driving, every single test route at my test centre Bolton and watched some youtube shorts aswell. I stayed up all night on some night doing this (which i don’t recommend) but keep watching videos and find scenarios you are unsure of

3. Private practice/google maps - I was very fortunate, every single road, roundabout and residential street I went on I basically had already been on. Why? Because I used videos and knowledge from my instructor to find these roads roundabouts and learn about the speed limits and positioning and in general I had more experience on roads I didn’t know. My instructor told me on the way back some people think they have to be taught everything and I found this wild because if you don’t be proactive in your approach to learning on your own the chances are you will likely not pass


4. There are so many more important things then a driving test. I know you feel like it’s a make or break and you’ll have to wait ages for another test but trust me just imagine your past and think about all the other experiences you have endured and when compared to your driving test tell yourself you can literally take it again and you have your whole life ahead of you so don’t stress about it to the point where it effects you on a daily

But when it’s time to actually get moving, excuses sneak in fast. ""*I’m too tired*,"" ""*I’ll start tomorrow,*"" or the classic, ""*Just one more episode*."" Sound familiar?

Here’s the secret: the magic isn’t in doing a perfect workout. It’s in simply showing up—*every single day*. Once you’re there, momentum takes over.

# Start Small, Start Smart

Don’t overthink it. You don’t need an hour at the gym or fancy equipment. A 5-minute walk, a stretch session, or some jumping jacks at home can be enough to get going. Action creates motivation—not the other way around.

# Attach It to Something You Already Do

Link movement to your daily routine. Try: ""After I make coffee, I’ll do 10 squats."" Or, ""Before I shower, I’ll do a quick yoga flow."" Habits grow when they’re connected to things you already do without thinking.

# Progress, Not Perfection

Stop aiming for the “perfect” workout. Some days will feel easy, others like a struggle. It’s okay. The win is in showing up, even when it’s messy, tired, or half-hearted.

# Remove the Barriers

Lay out your workout clothes the night before. Keep a water bottle nearby. Set a reminder on your phone. The less thinking required, the more likely you’ll do it.

# Build a Streak, Not Pressure

Mark each workout on a calendar. Seeing a streak grow is powerful. Even five minutes a day counts.



***Showing up doesn’t require motivation—it requires a decision. Make that decision today, and again tomorrow. That’s how change begins.***

It was painful, a harsh slap to the face, but at least it happened early in my life, and that’s a good thing. Some people spend years before going through something like this.

Okay, let’s begin.

I developed feelings for a girl at my university. She worked there — she’s a bit older than me, but only by a few months. She helped me during my final year. She’s kind, beautiful, and super friendly with everyone — very extroverted. That can be both a blessing and a curse.

Now, normally I’m not the type to get involved with girls or chase after them. I always stayed away from that stuff. But sometimes, a certain girl comes into your mind and heart, and any guy who has felt this knows how emotions can destroy everything. For two weeks straight, I couldn’t think about anything but her.

Eventually, we got to know each other more. We followed each other on Instagram, chatted, and exchanged memes. I was naive — I genuinely thought she felt the same way. I later realized I was wrong. But back then, everything felt perfect.

Let me pause the story here and explain something about her. She’s very open-minded, from an upper-class background. She mostly speaks English because she went to an international school. That wasn’t an issue for me. She liked dark/racist humor memes, swore in English, and was super casual — and again, I was totally fine with all of that.

But the downside? She wouldn’t reply right away. Sometimes she’d disappear for a while, and it bothered me how she didn’t see a problem riding alone in an Uber with a guy. (Please don’t judge me too quickly — just hear me out and try to understand my feelings.)

Anyway, I finally got the courage to confess my feelings. I was tired of hiding it. If she accepted, great. If not, I was ready to move on. I told her I loved her.

She said okay — but after I graduate. She also said I’m not in the friendzone and gave some mixed signals. But overall, I was happy and hopeful.

We kept talking on WhatsApp for a few days, then went back to Instagram. One day, I noticed she changed her profile picture, so I messaged her. I thought she would respond, especially since she said she had feelings too. But she didn’t reply at all or even react. Then four days later, she posted a story — so she clearly saw my message. I got frustrated and ignored her for two full weeks.

During that time, we had just finished a project discussion for a course. I posted a story with my friends, and I hadn’t been watching her stories or reacting at all. Out of nowhere, she liked my story and messaged me the next day, sending memes. She said, “I would’ve sent you more if I knew you weren’t busy.”
(I know you’re probably thinking, “What a fool,” but stay with me.)

I ignored her messages for three days. Then I finally replied — but calmly and distant.

Here’s something odd: she posted a story, deleted it, then reposted the same thing the next day and deleted it again. Then after messaging me, she added me to her “close friends” and posted that same story again — but deleted it 10 minutes later. I didn’t understand what that meant, and when I asked, she vaguely said it was just pointing at something, but I didn’t ask again.

We got back to talking. Things felt normal again. Then came a shocking moment — her dad passed away. May he rest in peace. I offered my condolences, of course. Later, she messaged me asking to meet up for coffee, to help her forget and distract herself.

We had a great day together — cinema, coffee, talking.

We ended up going out four times. She invited me once, I invited her once, we exchanged gifts — everything seemed fine.

Then I confessed again. I told her seriously that I loved her. She said, “Okay, give me 3 days and I’ll let you know — but only if you’re not talking to other girls or seeing me as a second option.”

Three days later, she said “okay” and confirmed her feelings. But still, whenever we went out, she’d say things like, “I don’t know how I feel toward you yet — maybe I need more time with you to figure it out.”

She would get jealous, hold my hand, rest her head on my chest or shoulder, but the words she used still sounded like we were “just friends.”

The last time we went out, everything seemed normal and fine. The day after that, still okay. The following day, I sent her a meme — and boom, she blocked me.

I was shocked.

I checked her bio — she had removed it. What the hell? She always said she was honest and didn’t ghost or block people. She said she doesn’t treat people like second options.

She hadn’t blocked me on Instagram, though. I waited a day. Then the next day, I tried calling her — no answer. I kept trying, nothing. By the end of that day, I sent her 3 Instagram messages saying basically:

“If silence is your answer, then forget about the relationship.”

The next day, she called me. Said two words. Then the call cut off from her end. I tried calling back many times. Nothing. I felt like I had the right to know why. What did I do wrong? I’m not someone who likes drama.

Then she blocked all calls from me.

I messaged her from another number, saying it’s me, just wanting to understand. Then she unfollowed me on Instagram.

At that point, you can say whatever you want about me — but I felt crushed. My dignity felt dragged through the dirt.

I honestly thought she was different from the others. Thought she was mature. But turns out, she was just a kid — even more immature than the rest.

I know I lowered myself. But I had the right to ask why. I feel broken, guilty, even stupid for being in this relationship in the first place. There were so many red flags. But any guy knows how emotions can cloud your mind.

Anyway, thank God — I got the slap early. I still have the army ahead, work, and life. Yes, I’m sad. But I’m better off than others. And honestly, screw it — the most important thing I’ve learned is this:

Focus on yourself. No one’s going to be there for you like you will.

I realized that at this age, people can seem like they love you like crazy. But inside them? They’re filled with doubts.
So work on yourself — it’s the better investment.



Btw she stold me about her 2 exes she said she never had official relationship with them before but she blocked one of them and the other ghosted her ....

The moment I stepped inside, the cozy wooden interior and soft lighting created a calm, intimate space, perfect for slowing down in the city.

The coffee came in a simple yet elegant white porcelain cup with a navy saucer and a gold-rimmed spoon—classic and refined. The roast leaned dark, giving it a bold aroma. It had a smooth mouthfeel with nutty and slightly chocolatey undertones, making it a wonderful match with the dessert.

The cheesecake was a generous wedge, served atop a piece of faux newspaper wrapping that added a touch of whimsy. It’s a no-bake style with a dense, creamy texture and a gentle sweetness. The top had a slight sheen, suggesting a rich cream cheese base.

It all started with good intentions. I woke up, told myself *“Today is the day I get my life together,”* made a to-do list, and even brewed a cup of coffee. That should’ve been my first red flag. When I start making to-do lists voluntarily, I’m either about to conquer the world or descend into chaos. Spoiler: it was chaos.

With my workspace neatly organized (read: I shoved everything into a drawer), I sat down to “focus.” My laptop was open, a fresh document waiting, and I was ready to crush goals. So naturally, I checked Instagram “for five minutes.” Three dog reels, two influencer breakdowns, and one existential crisis later, it was suddenly lunchtime.

That’s when it happened. I decided to “rest my eyes” for *just* ten minutes. You know, recharge. Regain mental clarity. Center my soul or whatever productivity gurus on YouTube say. I even set an alarm. I am not a rookie.

Then, darkness.

I woke up four hours later in complete confusion, like I’d been cryogenically frozen and just released into a future where my to-do list had evolved into a to-didn’t list. My coffee was ice cold. My phone had 37 notifications. My productivity? Missing. Presumed dead.

So what did I learn from this deeply unplanned nap? Absolutely nothing. Except that sleep hits different when it’s completely irresponsible. Also, naps longer than 30 minutes are not naps—they’re full-blown time travel.

But in the spirit of optimism, let’s reframe it. I didn’t waste the day—I *invested* in my mental health via unconscious meditation. And sure, I got nothing done, but I did dream that I was best friends with a raccoon wearing sunglasses. So there’s that.

Tomorrow, I’ll try again. After all, productivity is a journey. And sometimes, that journey takes a detour through Napland.",1,1753785890.0,Newbwriters,0,1.0,False

>“You fairies wouldn’t last ten minutes without your anxiety meds and dildos, let alone on a battlefield. 🤣”  
  
Danny hit “Post” and smirked at his phone, basking in the flood of laughing reacts. That thread was pure fire—memes, sarcasm, that good old we're the real men vibe.  
  
But one reply didn’t fit.  
  
> “You don’t know us. But we know you. That’s the only warning you’ll get.”  
  
No emoji. No exclamation. Just… calm.  
  
He screenshotted it to share in the group chat—“check out this softboi larp threat 😂”—but something about it sat weird in his chest. He shook it off. Keyboard warriors, all bark. No one would actually do anything. That was the whole point. His side trained. His side had gear. His side was ready.  

---
  
###The Grocery Line  
  
The next day, Danny stopped at a strip-mall supermarket after work. Six-pack of Monster, beef jerky, some microwave burritos. Just a guy grabbing fuel before heading home to work on his truck and maybe check in on the Discord.  
  
He stood in line behind a woman and her kid, scrolling his phone.  
  
Someone stepped into line behind him.  
  
Danny glanced up briefly. Just some dude—mid-thirties, glasses, unremarkable. Wore a bookstore T-shirt and carried a canvas bag. Looked like the kind of guy who used words like problematic and thought open-carry was a form of “violence.”  
  
Danny almost chuckled. But something in the guy’s eyes made him pause.  
  
The man looked at him—not mean, not scared. Just looked. Like he saw something. Like he knew something. 
  
Then he turned away, placed a single can of tomatoes on the conveyor belt, and waited in silence.  
  
No confrontation. No words. Just a moment.  
  
Danny’s heart thudded once. Then again. He left the store without buying anything.  

---
  
###The Cracks  
  
At the meetup that weekend, someone was joking about “giving woke teachers something to really cry about.” Another guy flashed his new molle rig and said he’d been “mapping escape routes” at the local library in case things “got spicy.”  
  
Danny laughed along, but his mouth felt dry.  
  
That woman and her kid from the supermarket—he pictured them caught in some crossfire while these guys larped through a fantasy revolution.  
  
He didn’t sleep well that night.  

---
  
###The Medic  
  
It was a summer festival downtown. His cousin asked him to help out with security—“keep the peace in case some pronoun patrol shows up.”  
  
It was a normal shift, until a drunk guy threw a bottle at a food truck window. Danny moved to break it up and got his forearm cut on a piece of metal jutting from the booth.  
  
“Hold still,” someone said. Hands gloved in blue latex wrapped around his wrist. Firm, practiced. Calm.  
  
It was a medic. Slender, short hair, rainbow pin on their vest.  
  
Danny flinched. “You sure you wanna help a guy like me?”  
  
The medic didn’t blink. “You’re bleeding, aren’t you?”  
  
Silence.  
  
As they taped him up, they added, “You don’t look like you’re having fun in that skin anymore.”  
  
Danny didn’t say anything. But those words chased him into his dreams.  

---
  
###The Plan  
  
Back in the chat, the talk turned darker. There was a protest scheduled for next Saturday. They’d “bring a presence.” Make it clear that their town wasn’t going to be turned into “Seattle 2.0.”  
  
Someone posted a list of names.  
  
Danny recognized one.  
  
It was the woman from the store. She was a local counselor. Helped run the food bank. Danny had seen her in photos at charity drives, giving out winter coats.  
  
“She’s a subversive,” someone wrote.  
  
That’s when it hit him.  
  
They didn’t see people. They saw targets.  

---
  
###The Break  
  
Danny didn’t show up on Saturday. He sent an anonymous tip to organizers about the “presence.” They relocated quietly, no one hurt.  
  
Back in the chat, his name lit up.  
  
> “Anyone heard from Danny?” “Ditcher.” “Maybe he got woke. 😂”  
  
He didn’t reply.  
  
He deleted the app. Burned his patch. Threw the vest into a dumpster behind a gas station.  
  
And for the first time in years, he took a walk through town without looking over his shoulder like it was a battlefield.  

---
  
###The New Room  
  
Weeks later, he sat in the back of a library conference room. A community resilience group met every Tuesday. No uniforms. Just handouts about conflict de-escalation, mental health resources, and food distribution.  
  
He didn’t speak at first. Just listened.  
  
Then, one evening, someone turned to him and asked, “Why’d you come?”  
  
Danny looked down at his hands.  
  
“I used to think I was strong. That being loud and armed made me right. That empathy was weakness.”  
  
He took a breath.  
  
“But then I saw people choosing kindness even when they were scared. I saw people helping others who hated them. And I realized… maybe I wasn’t strong. Maybe I was just loud.”  
  
He looked around the room.  
  
“I’m here because I want to learn what real strength looks like.”  
  
Someone offered him a cup of coffee. Another handed him a flyer for a mutual aid drive.  
  
No one clapped. No one gave a speech.  
  
They just welcomed him in.

Should I tell him? Would that be embarrassing?,"I’m (25m) a flight attendant, the guy (34m) I see is also one.

I’ll keep it very brief.

We talked for a month now and then, found a time to date. It was all great. Not 10/10, but it doesn’t need to be 10. That date covered a coffee date, a very nice dinner, hours of talking at his place about lots of stuff, evening into morning into making out and being all over each other. It was one of the best dates in my book.

Our schedule is not a great match and we live a little far away so it’s been like 10 days we haven’t seen eacher unless it is in our base. We have small talk if we bump into each other because we are in a rush mostly.

I know I will fall deeper. He is nice, attractive, intelligent etc. He makes plans on travelling together- seeing the world together (which HAS always been one of my dreams to do with a partner so when he said that.. I was sold, so naive).

He treated me sooooooo nice that I forgot all the other ones and that is huge bonus too, he probably does that to lots of people though.

He says he wants to meet again.

Again, I just know I will fall harder if we keep talking and seeing each other. If it becomes serious. We can match our off days and have more time together.

However, he is on the apps. He is actively looking for other people I know that. I am not a person that can date multiple people at the same time, I understand them, and actually it little bothers me, but I am not expecting exclusivity after one date. 

So since I know, I will fall harder. I don’t want to risk my sanity because I am losing it a little whenever I see he’s following new people because it’s like he’s making those cute plans but boom. 

If we ever get serious, we can manage it.

But for our next date, I want to tell him; It is very possible for me to fall harder for you because of these reasons, but I don’t want to let myself fall harder unless there is no possible further connection. Even if we decide to be fwb’s I know I’ll catch feelings so maybe it is just better not to see each other anymore.

Is it stupid of me to end it? I’m so confused. I feel like I’m doing something wrong.

TLDR; I will start to have feelings for this guy, but it won’t end good most probably. Should I end it on the next date?",4,1753785788.0,askgaybros,9,0.84,False

Her Sweet Escape From Chaos
Adriana Cotton lived a life of perfect order, a flawless extension of her husband Gifford Stanton's brand. Her dresses were tailored, her posture straight, her smile measured. She was the epitome of a Stanton wife.

But on her birthday, she found him at a food truck, silk tie loosened, peeling a hot dog for a young woman giggling across from him. It was Jovita Griffith, the daughter of their former housekeeper, whose education Gifford had been funding for years under the guise of charity.

Adriana's carefully constructed composure shattered. She confronted them, only to be met with Gifford's dismissive excuses and Jovita's feigned innocence. She posted a scathing selfie, but Gifford, blind to the truth, accused her of being overly emotional and announced Jovita would be staying with them.

Later that night, she returned home to find her surprise birthday party in full swing, hosted by Jovita, who was wearing Adriana's vintage Chanel dress. Jovita, smug and victorious, whispered venomous words, claiming Gifford found Adriana ""cold in bed. Like a fish.""

The insult, a brutal blow, pushed Adriana past her breaking point. Her hand flew up, connecting with Jovita's cheek, the s**p echoing through the silent room. Gifford, enraged, cradled Jovita, glaring at Adriana as if she were a monster.

He roared, ""Have you lost your mind?"" He accused her of humiliating him, of being out of control, and ordered her banished to the countryside. Adriana, however, was done playing by his rules. She called Alexzander Wilson, her childhood friend, who arrived by helicopter to whisk her away.

""Not anymore,"" she told Gifford, her voice clear and strong. ""We are not a family."" She threw divorce papers in his face, leaving him and Jovita to their chaos.


Chapter 1
Adriana Cotton lived by a set of rules. Not her rules, but his. Gifford Stanton's rules.

He was a man of impeccable taste and discipline, and as his wife, she was expected to be the same. Her dresses were always perfectly tailored, her posture always straight, her smile always measured. She was a flawless extension of the Stanton brand.

But Gifford, the architect of this rigid world, was breaking his own code.

He was sitting at a food truck, of all places. He had loosened his silk tie, a transgression she'd never witnessed. He leaned back in a cheap plastic chair, a half-peeled hot dog in his hand. He offered it to the young woman giggling across from him.

Adriana parked her luxury SUV down the street. The click of her designer heels on the pavement was sharp and angry. She walked toward them.

""Mr. Stanton, tough day at the office? Is this your new conference room?""

Gifford looked up. The relaxed expression on his face vanished, replaced by a mask of shock and guilt.

From his open laptop on the table, a voice chirped, ""Mr. Stanton, taking your lady out for street food, huh, haha...""

Adriana leaned into the camera's view. The man on the screen, one of Gifford's associates, froze. His jesting smile disappeared. ""Ms. Cotton,"" he stammered nervously.

Gifford slammed the laptop shut.

""Adriana, let me explain. This is Jovita Griffith. Mrs. Miller's daughter. She just got back from overseas.""

Jovita smiled, her eyes wide and innocent. ""Ms. Cotton, it's so nice to finally meet you! Gifford talks about you all the time.""

Adriana knew who she was. The daughter of their family's former housekeeper, Mrs. Miller. Gifford had been funding her education abroad for years. Millions. He had called it charity. A noble gesture. Adriana now saw how naive she had been.

She ignored Jovita's outstretched hand. Instead, she sat down and picked up the hot dog Gifford had been peeling. Gifford, a man so obsessed with decorum he wouldn't touch food with his bare hands. She once saw him at a gala, faced with a messy hors d'oeuvre, meticulously use a fork and knife to eat it. Now, he was peeling a hot dog for another woman.

Adriana took a small, deliberate bite. She chewed for a moment, then delicately spit the food into a napkin.

""This hot dog tastes off.""

Jovita's eyes immediately filled with tears. ""Ms. Cotton, it's all my fault. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to cause a misunderstanding...""

A misunderstanding? Adriana felt a cold laugh rising in her ch**t. She pulled out her phone. She framed a selfie to include all three of them, zooming in on Jovita's perfectly tear-streaked face.

Jovita gasped and reached for the phone. ""What are you doing?""

Adriana's glare stopped her cold. ""Just taking a picture. Why are you so flustered?""

Right there, in front of them, she posted the photo to her social media. The caption was simple and brutal.

""My husband's birthday surprise. So unique.""

Gifford frowned. He wanted to stop her but didn't know what to say. After a long, tense silence, he finally sighed. ""Adriana, don't be so sensitive. I just see her as a little sister.""

Jovita immediately chimed in, her voice trembling. ""That's right, Ms. Cotton...""

Adriana cut her off with a sharp laugh. ""Calling the housekeeper's daughter 'sister'? My family doesn't have that rule.""

Jovita's tears flowed freely now, as if she had suffered a terrible injustice.

Adriana stood up to leave. She had seen enough.

But Gifford shot out of his chair and grabbed her wrist. His grip was surprisingly strong, bruising. ""Adriana Cotton, you are being incredibly rude. A wife of a Stanton shouldn't act like this.""

Always that line. The wife of a Stanton.

His tone grew impatient. ""Alright, stop making a scene. Jovita just got back, and she has nowhere to stay. She'll be staying with us for a while. Drive us home.""

Adriana felt an absurd urge to laugh. She turned and looked directly into his deep, angry eyes.

""Gifford Stanton,"" she asked, her voice dangerously calm, ""why today?""


Chapter 2
Gifford looked momentarily confused by her question. ""What do you mean, why today?""

He started to repeat his earlier excuse. ""I told you, she just got back...""

""Stop,"" Adriana cut him off, her voice low but sharp. ""Today is my birthday, Gifford. You chose my birthday to do this.""

She glanced at Jovita, who was now hiding her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking with sobs. But Adriana saw the flicker of triumph in her eyes before she looked away.

""And she knows it, doesn't she? She's enjoying this.""

Adriana thought of all the years she had spent molding herself into the perfect Stanton wife. She gave up her fiery personality, her love for loud music, her casual clothes. She learned about fine art, opera, and the intricacies of corporate law, all to stand beside him, to be a credit to him. She had given up herself.

And for what? For him to dismiss her pain, to champion the daughter of a housekeeper over her, on her own birthday. The unfairness of it was a physical weight in her ch**t.

""You're being overly emotional,"" Gifford said, his voice laced with disdain.

That was the final push. Adriana wrenched her arm from his grip with a strength that surprised them both. She turned and walked back to her car without another word.

Jovita's voice followed her, a soft, wounded wh**per. ""Gifford, maybe I should leave... I've made Ms. Cotton so unhappy.""

Adriana felt a wave of nausea. The girl's performance was flawless.

She got in her SUV and drove, with no destination in mind. The city lights blurred through her unshed tears. She remembered Gifford's proposal, so formal and correct. He had promised her a life of respect, of partnership. A lie. Every word a lie. She regretted her choice so deeply it hurt to breathe.

Her phone rang, startling her. It was Alexzander Wilson.

""Happy birthday, Addy,"" his cheerful voice boomed through the car's speakers. ""I miss you like crazy. Say the word and I'll fly back right now.""

Adriana managed a weak smile. ""You're in Tokyo, Alex. Don't be ridiculous.""

""For you, I'd swim,"" he said, and she knew he meant it. His devotion was a stark, painful contrast to the coldness she had just left behind.

After an hour of aimless driving, she finally went home. It was late, past midnight. She expected a dark, quiet house.

Instead, the mansion was blazing with lights. Music and laughter spilled out onto the manicured lawn.

She walked in and stopped dead. Her living room was filled with people. It was a party. A surprise birthday party she never wanted.

And in the center of it all was Jovita, acting as the hostess. She was greeting guests, directing the catering staff, a radiant smile on her face.

Then Adriana saw it. Jovita was wearing the vintage Chanel dress Adriana had been saving for a special occasion. Her special occasion.

Adriana felt like a stranger in her own home.

Gifford saw her and hurried over, a strained smile on his face. ""Adriana! You're back. We were worried. I thought, since the evening started so poorly, a little celebration might...""

Adriana's eyes were fixed on Jovita. ""What is she doing, Gifford? Hosting my birthday party?""

""She was just trying to help,"" he said, his voice defensive. ""She organized all of this to make it up to you.""

""And the dress?"" Adriana's voice was ice. ""Did you give her permission to wear my clothes, too?""

""Don't be so petty, Adriana,"" he snapped. ""It's just a dress.""

Jovita watched them from across the room, a small, triumphant smile playing on her lips. A few guests, friends of the family, started to move toward them, sensing the tension.

""Adriana, Gifford, happy birthday!"" one of them said, trying to diffuse the situation.

Gifford was pulled away into a conversation, leaving Adriana alone.

Jovita seized the opportunity. She glided over to Adriana, her voice a poisonous wh**per only she could hear.

""You see? This is my place now.""

She leaned closer. ""You got what you deserved. You were never good enough for him.""

""He and I,"" Jovita purred, ""we belong together. We always have.""

Adriana looked down at the younger woman, at her smug, victorious face.

""Are you trying to be a homewrecker, Jovita?"" she asked, her voice dangerously soft.

""We have a history you know nothing about,"" Jovita sneered. She leaned in, her lips almost touching Adriana's ear. ""He told me you're cold in bed. Like a fish.""

The words hit Adriana harder than a physical blow. In that moment, all the rules, all the discipline, all the carefully constructed composure shattered.

Without a second thought, Adriana's hand flew up and connected with Jovita's cheek. The sound of the slap echoed through the suddenly silent room.


Chapter 3
The music stopped. Every conversation died. All eyes were on them.

Gifford ripped himself away from his conversation and rushed forward, his face a mask of fury.

He pushed past Adriana and knelt beside Jovita, who was now crumpled on the floor, sobbing dramatically. ""Are you okay? Jovita, are you hurt?""

He cradled her protectively, glaring up at Adriana as if she were a monster.

Adriana, however, was perfectly calm. She felt a strange sense of clarity. She straightened her dress, her movements graceful and deliberate.

Her eyes landed on the diamond necklace around Jovita's throat. It was a one-of-a-kind piece Gifford had given her for their first anniversary.

She reached down and, with a swift, clean motion, unclasped the necklace. Jovita gasped, but was too stunned to resist.

Adriana held the glittering necklace up for everyone to see.

""Thank you all for coming to celebrate with me,"" she announced, her voice ringing through the silent hall. ""As a party favor...""

She walked over to a young, wide-eyed wife of a junior partner. The woman stared, mesmerized. Adriana smiled warmly and fastened the priceless necklace around the woman's neck.

""Happy birthday to me,"" Adriana said. ""It looks better on you.""

The woman stammered, speechless with shock and gratitude.

Adriana turned back to the crowd. ""The party's over. Please leave.""

Her tone was polite but firm. No one argued. Guests began to file out, whispering amongst themselves, their eyes darting between the composed wife, the furious husband, and the weeping mistress.

Once the last guest had departed, the silence in the grand hall was heavy and suffocating.

Gifford helped Jovita to her feet and settled her on a sofa before turning on Adriana.

""Have you lost your mind?"" he roared.

Adriana looked at him, truly looked at him, and felt a deep, hollowing sadness. This was the man she had loved, the man she had changed her entire life for.

""She in**lted me, Gifford. In our home. At my party.""

""So you hit her? You humiliate me in front of everyone?""

Adriana felt too tired to argue. She turned away from him. ""I'm going to bed.""

Gifford grabbed her arm. ""We're not done.""

His face was contorted with a mixture of anger and exhaustion. ""I'm tired of this, Adriana.""

She simply looked at his hand on her arm until he let go. She walked to the grand staircase, her back straight.

He sighed, the anger draining out of him, replaced by a weary frustration. ""Look,"" he said, his voice softer. ""I know this is difficult. But I have a responsibility to Jovita. Her mother saved my grandmother's life years ago. I owe them.""

""I will talk to her,"" he promised, as if it were a great concession. ""I'll teach her some manners.""

Adriana stopped on the stairs and looked back at him. She felt a bitter laugh escape her lips. ""You'll teach her? You, who let her into our home to destroy our marriage?""

""Will you teach her not to sl**p with another woman's husband? Or is that part of the lesson plan?""

Gifford's face turned red. ""That's enough!"" he shouted, slamming his fist on a nearby table. The sound echoed in the cavernous room.

""She is my family! Just like you are!""

Family. The word felt like a lie. Tears pricked at Adriana's eyes, but she refused to let them fall. Not in front of him.

""You broke every single one of your precious rules for her, Gifford,"" she said, her voice trembling slightly. ""The rules you drilled into me for years.""

She began to list them, her voice growing stronger with each word. ""No casual attire in public. No eating with your hands. No emotional outbursts. No behavior that could tarnish the Stanton name.""

""You did all of it. For her. In one afternoon.""

Gifford's face shifted through a dozen emotions: anger, guilt, shame. He stood there, speechless.

Adriana took a deep breath. She pulled out her phone and called the head of their household staff.

""Please prepare the north wing guest suite for Miss Griffith,"" she said, her voice crisp and authoritative. ""And ensure none of her belongings remain in the main house.""

The butler's hesitant voice came through the phone. ""But, Ma'am, Mr. Stanton said...""

Adriana didn't let him finish. ""I am Mrs. Stanton. Do it.""

She hung up.

Gifford stared at her, his face ashen. ""Adriana, calm down. Let's talk about this in the morning.""

""There's nothing to talk about,"" she said.

He stared at her for a long moment, then turned and stormed out of the house, slamming the front door behind him.

The sound echoed through the empty hall.

Alone, Adriana finally let herself collapse onto the bottom step of the staircase. The tears she had held back for so long finally came, silent and hot, streaming down her face.


Chapter 4
The next morning, Adriana walked downstairs, her face a mask of composure. She had cried all night, but she had put on her makeup, dressed in a sharp business suit, and was ready to face the day. Her dignity was the only thing she had left.

She found Jovita in the kitchen, humming a cheerful tune. She was wearing a pair of silky, ridiculously short pajamas that belonged to Adriana. She was making breakfast, acting as if she owned the place.

When Jovita saw Adriana, she gave a little g**p and tried to pull the thin robe tighter around herself.

""Oh, Ms. Cotton! I'm so sorry. I couldn't find my things, and I was just so hungry. I hope you don't mind.""

Gifford was sitting at the breakfast nook, sipping coffee and reading the paper. He didn't even look up.

Adriana ignored Jovita and addressed her husband. ""I believe the kitchen is for staff. We have a chef.""

Gifford finally lowered his paper, his expression annoyed. ""She was just being thoughtful, Adriana. Don't make everything a fight.""

Jovita immediately started to cry. ""I'm sorry, Ms. Cotton. I'll go. I didn't mean to intrude.""

Adriana let out a short, cold laugh and turned to leave.

""Adriana!"" Gifford called after her, but she didn't stop.

She drove straight to the city's most ruthless divorce lawyer.

""I want to file for divorce,"" she said, her voice steady. ""And I want a full breakdown of our shared assets. I want to know exactly what I am entitled to.""

The lawyer, a sharp woman named Ms. Davenport, nodded. ""I'll get my team on it immediately, Ms. Cotton. We'll make sure you get everything you deserve.""

Adriana spent the day in a haze, ignoring the constant buzz of her phone. Dozens of calls and texts from Gifford. She deleted them all without reading.

When she returned home that evening, the house was quiet. She walked up the sweeping staircase toward her bedroom, hoping for a moment of peace.

She pushed open the door and her breath caught in her throat.

The room was a disaster. Her king-sized bed was unmade, the silk sheets tangled and thrown aside. A lacy black piece of lingerie-not hers-was tossed carelessly on the floor. Gifford's shirt and pants were crumpled in a heap by the door.

The air was thick with the cloying scent of cheap perfume and s*x.

Adriana felt her knees go weak. This was her sanctuary. Their marital bed. The line had been crossed in the most brutal way possible.

""Gifford!"" The name was a raw scream torn from her throat.

He appeared in the doorway moments later, looking flustered. He took in the scene and his eyes widened in shock.

""What is this?"" Adriana demanded, her voice shaking with rage. ""Explain this to me.""

""I... I don't know,"" he stammered, avoiding her eyes. ""Jovita was helping the maids with laundry, maybe...""

He denied knowing anything about the lingerie.

Just then, Jovita appeared behind him, her cheeks flushed a pretty pink.

""Oh, Ms. Cotton,"" she said, feigning shyness. ""I am so, so sorry. I saw your beautiful lingerie when I was helping put away clothes, and I just couldn't resist trying it on. I never thought you'd come home so early.""

Gifford looked relieved. ""See? It was just a misunderstanding. She's a young girl, she was just being curious."" He turned to Adriana. ""Now, can we please just drop this?""

The rage in Adriana's ch**t was so immense she thought she might explode.

""A misunderstanding?"" she asked, her voice dangerously low. ""What's next? You'll tell me if I walked in on you two in bed, you were just 'exercising'together?""

Gifford's face darkened with anger. ""You've changed, Adriana. You've become bitter and suspicious.""

He accused her of being unreasonable.

Adriana thought about the woman she used to be before him-fiery, confident, and free. She had become so obedient, so quiet. This wasn't her. It was a role she had played, and she was done.

From her briefcase, she pulled out a thick manila envelope and threw it on the messy bed.

""Divorce papers, Gifford. Sign them.""

His eyes widened, his pupils shrinking to pinpricks. ""You can't be serious.""

""I've never been more serious in my life.""

""Adriana, calm down,"" he pleaded.

""I am calm,"" she stated, her voice flat. ""I want a divorce.""

With a roar of fury, he snatched the papers and ripped them to shreds. ""I will not divorce you! This is ridiculous!""

Jovita began to sob in the doorway, her body trembling. ""It's all my fault,"" she cried. ""If I had never come back, none of this would have happened.""

Adriana turned her cold gaze on the girl. ""You're right. You never should have come back.""

Jovita wailed louder.

Gifford rushed to her side, pulling her into a protective embrace. ""She's just a child, Adriana! How can you be so cruel?""

The argument escalated, their shouts echoing through the house. The noise brought the Stanton Matriarch, Gifford's grandmother, hurrying down the hall.

The old woman took in the scene-the trashed bedroom, her weeping grandson, the crying girl, and Adriana's stony face. She sighed heavily.

""Adriana, my dear,"" she said, her voice frail but firm. ""I am so sorry for all of this."" She explained the debt of gratitude the family owed Jovita's mother, who had once saved her from a terrible accident.

""We are taking care of her as a way of repaying that debt,"" the matriarch said, tears in her eyes. ""Please, forgive Gifford's foolishness. I will take Jovita away. She will not bother you again.""

Gifford, looking chastened, also apologized. ""Adriana, I'm sorry. Please, give me one more chance.""

Looking at the old woman's desperate face, Adriana's resolve wavered. Perhaps it could be fixed. She gave a small, hesitant nod.

The matriarch sent Jovita away. A fragile peace settled over the house. For a few days, Gifford was attentive and kind. Adriana started to think about calling her lawyer, about withdrawing the divorce petition.

Then, one evening, the front door burst open. Gifford stormed in, his face a thundercloud. Behind him, held up by a butler, was Jovita. Her clothes were torn, her face was bruised, and she was crying hysterically.

Gifford pointed a shaking finger at Adriana. ""You! How could you do this to her?""

1mc81nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_hannahJ004/comments/1mc81nz/oldest_sister_visit/,Oldest sister visit!!,"We survived the school holidays with a lot of fights, a lot of movies, 1 kid turned hairdresser cutting off their own hair (and saying they didnt lmao), and 1 ED trip. 10yr old had a bad bike accident and had so many different cuts that I didnt feel confident dealing with them myself and honestly almost threw up while trying (and I’m not even that squeamish) and she was crying so much about her wrist hurting I thought she broke it. She threw up and I was like yeah nah we need a professional bc this is toooo much. I literally called Matt crying and he came home from work and I took her in to get checked out and cleaned up and bandaged and she had to get  an xray. But it wasnt broken luckily. I wanted Matt to take her but the shrieking when I even suggested it was like… ok I guess I’m going. Lol. The nurse told her no bike riding without shoes which was good bc I have told her so many times and literally that day I said to her to put shoes on before she went outside and she’s like ok, and then immediately takes them off. I dont think the crash was bc of no shoes but she literally lost a chunk of her big toe. So I sent her back to school looking like she’d been to war and wearing her big sisters crocs bc her toe hurt in any other shoe. She didnt sleep well for a couple nights after and was just feeling unwell in general. But just looking at her cuts made me feel unwell so makes sense that she felt like that. 

Oh and the 2nd worst thing about the holidays, Matt grounded our little brother without asking me and I was so fkn annoyed because who the helllll wants a 13yr old boy home 24/7 who wants to be as irritating as possible to try be let out. I was so close to being like you can go out but don’t tell Matt. But I didnt bc I didnt want another argument. I survived but it was rough af

Then after the holidays ended my oldest sister flew over for a visit. It was kinda awkward to arrange bc she said she was gonna come and I had to be like ok cool but you can't stay with us. She didn't take that so well. But as I told her, she called my 8yr old an energy vampire multiple times and has tried manipulating the older girls to go stay with her behind my back... and a shit ton of other crap, so yeah big surprise I do not want her staying with us. Like idk if I’m crazy but the thought of her being in house and being around the kids gave me anxiety bc I can’t keep tabs on 6 kids all the time and idk if she would say anything crazy to them. I wasn't sure if she would come after that convo but she did and she stayed in a hotel. 

We decided to tell 17yo that big sis was visiting. Which tbh Matt had to convince me to do bc I was hell against telling her, bc my anxiety was like nope. Ever since my oldest sister tried to convince 17 and then 14 to go and stay/live with her I just had this kinda crazy thought that if 17 knew she was over here visiting and then we had a fight, she might go find her and somehow fly back with her. And it was stressing me out. Pretty irrational considering 17yr old has made it very clear that she doesnt want to go stay with oldest sis and we dont have huge fights like that (well, not recently lol). But I couldn’t help it and kept saying to Matt like no we aren’t telling her, she doesn’t need to know, yappa yappa yap. Running my mouth. Matt normally lets me have my way if I’m super against something bc he cba to argue with me (and with kid stuff we usually say if one of us is really against something, we lean towards no). But he kept saying nah she needs to know, she’s almost an adult, we need to give her the chance to see her if she wants to, how’s she gonna feel if we don’t tell her and she finds out. And also she’d be sus about Matt and Sis 2 going out in the evening. 
Soooo I realised I was being an idiot and decided to tell her. And it was hell anti climatic bc after alll the drama with Matt over it, we told her and she was like “ok” and we said do you want to see her… “umm no, obviously not”. Lol. 

The first day big sis was here Matt had the baby and I went to see her by myself. It was... pretty fucked tbh. Like idk how to describe it. I was shaking so much before I saw her. So nervous. It was sad, veryyy emotional, a bit awkward but also sort of nice. I hadn't seen her in so long and she was literally my mum when I was a kid, and I felt that really strongly when I saw her. She's the only person in the world that I have had what felt like parental love from (at the time), which is weird now bc I realised how small the age gap is now that we're both adults. It's the same as 14yr old being 8yr olds 'mum' now, which would be so weird. But that gap must have felt huge when I was little bc I really think of her as so much older in my mind. It was like my whole body was in some kind of shock and super overwhelming. 

I purposely didn't think about the stuff thats happened with us over the past 18 months, and was trying to just think of her as she was when I was younger and it was a lot easier to get through it that way. Bc a big part of me lowkey wanted to punch her in the face after she has been such a fkn cunt about so much stuff. I told her that though bc it was the only way to get it out of my head lol. I was literally like, it's nice to see you but I really want to punch you. And she was like... that's fair. lmao. She did apologise for being a cunt, which was good to hear, but I still dont actually trust her. She was a lot less whining and vulnerable irl than she is over text, it felt more like when we were younger and she was kinda… strict. Like obviously not being strict about anything whilst we are out for fkn coffee but the uptight, looking at me like she’s my mother, telling the waiter my order for me… and just general vibe, was like oh mother is here. Lmao. And I probably felt it more bc its so long since I have been around a mother type person that isnt myself. 

We talked a lot, mostly about old memories and mostly good stuff. Only spoke about the bad stuff for a little bit. I showed her some photos of the kids, bc I dont send her them in case she sends them on, and I could tell it was hard for her. But she had asked to see them. I had to leave to get the little kids at school and it was obvious she really didn't want me to go. So that was hard bc I felt bad. But Matt went to see her later on after we'd got through most of the evening routine. He said she basically just talked about me though

Next morning my other sister was back from work and was gonna go see her alone bc Matt had work and I had the baby, but I decided that I'd be ok with my oldest sister seeing the baby so me and Sis 2 both went to spend the day with her. Turns out Sis 2 didn't want to go by herself anyway bc I guess she fell out with oldest sis a few years ago. 

It was a whole new situation having the baby there as well and oldest sister was super emotional. Obviously the baby has no fkn clue what's going on and she's so happy atm that she was literally smiling and laughing constantly. She made everything feel a lot easier and less intense bc she was a distraction. It was actually hell weird to be sitting with my 20 something sisters and also our 10 month old sister being with us. Normally now I just think of her as my baby but being there it was pretty strange to think she is equally related to all of us, and she's not actually mine. Idk why it hit me whilst there, bc it's the same as when she's with me and Matt and Sis 2, but it felt different. 

We saw her a few more times through the week, usually just alternating around someone needing to be with the kids. Mostly that looked like me seeing her whilst they were in school and then someone else seeing her in the evening, bc kid problems didn't stop whilst she was there and with all the craziness lately I really didnt want to cause any meltdowns by trying to leave them in the evening. 14yr old has been testing the boundaries a lot recently and Matt isn’t exactly comfortable dealing with her bc she freaks out if he tries to parent her so it’s easier for me to do it. 13yr old has been kinda unstable since a few weeks ago when I had to take the youngest to hospital in the night and lil bro woke up to me not being in the house, and he panicked and thought I left and we are still dealing with some tears at night and general anxiety about me being out. 10yr old gets upset if I don’t put her to bed when I’m at home, let alone if I was out and after her accident she’s been even more clingy. And 8yr old is 8yr old… girl is never happy unless she’s stuck to me like glue. Plus just coming off school holidays we have had to readjust to going to school again which is always so rough for her. Every night going to bed she is crying about not wanting to go to school. And she is not sleeping well again. Not to mention the baby who is in her velcro era. 
So me going out in the evening is a no go rn. Which my sister doesn’t understand, but thats just how it is. She kept saying let’s do dinner and I’m like um you can have Matt or Sis 2 but I’m off limits after school finishes. Bc I know I would come home to a heap of crying kids and Matt would look like he got hit by a truck

So I just saw her in the day and things got more and more chill and less intense every time. Felt more like how I remember her before she got depressed when she was like 14. Then Saturday came which was her last day, and me Matt and Sis 2 had been up late af discussing it and decided to let her see the kids. Bc she had asked a few times and had been pretty much fine/no red flags so I felt like a baby step of her seeing them with all three of us there would be ok. Called her in the morning to discuss and tell her the rules, which was basically do NOT mention any kids coming to stay with you, don't bring up our parents, don't treat 8yr old differently to the others (bc she has issues with 8 being labelled her ‘replacement’ and having almost the same name), and most of all dont be a cunt. 

Asked the kids if they wanted to see her and they said yeah, but were all hell sus about it. 17yr old actually said no and full wasnt coming until we were about to leave and suddenly changed her mind. I think she was curious + she has been kinda protective of 8 recently and I think she was worried about the situation with her bc she knows oldest sis has been… not so great about 8yr old in the past. 

We decided to go for lunch which was super exciting for the kids bc normally when they get to eat out it's a 1-1 thing, and they were all psyched about getting to go all together. It was hectic but ended up being nice. Oldest sis was emotional and a bit awkward but she actually made an effort and brought them a little gift each which she said she was gonna give me to give to them if she didnt get to see them. That got the younger ones immediately happy as hell and 10yr old went from sus to very impressed straight away. Big sis got her a lego set and kiddo asked for my phone to show photos of all her lego creations that she made me put into an album (loves to scroll through admiring her own work lmao). 

8yr old as expected didnt really say much, she was observing everything very closely and did edge towards big sis by coming over to me and pretending the cut on her finger was hurting again, knowing I would say oh no and suggest a magic cuddle to fix it lol. So she sat in my lap and then could side eye big sis to her hearts content bc she was sitting next to me. It was weird for me to see them so close to eachother tbh. Has been such a huge issue for like 8yr olds entire life and part of me thought my oldest sister would never be able to be around her bc she used to get sooo triggered by even mentioning her. Like I wasn’t allowed to talk about her at all. Even when she sat on me I was thinking oh no, big sis is gonna make a comment thats gonna piss me off. But she didnt and it was fine. At one point 8yr old was like “mum used to call me (big sis name) sometimes” and I swear I held my breath but big sis just acted like she didnt hear and it was all good. And then 8 said it again just to me and i was like yeah mum said some silly things, you have your own name. 

The teenagers were more unsure, and they were very polite which made it obvious to me and Matt that they weren't sure bc with us they are not that level of polite. Like they arent rude (mostly lol) but they are chill and dont go out their way to act like that normally. 17yr old wanted to hold the baby the whole time and I think that was her 'security blanket' type thing. All 3 teenagers were having their own convos a lot and basically created their own lil bubble. And all the kids were asking me what to order and like 1000 follow on questions, and I realised the wanting approval thing is a security check in type thing, which my therapist talks about a lot. Always says you will notice the kids in certain situations all looking to you and wanting help with stuff they wouldn't normally need help with. And of course 8yr old ate like two bites and was done, but then for the rest of the day was talking about how it is so fun to go to a restaurant and she loves restaurants food. Like what do you meannn child you barely touched it. 

Both 8 and 10 have struggled with understanding that we have another sister who doesn’t live with us, like it wasn’t registering in their brains and they would always think she was our cousin when we mentioned her. I think when Sis 2 came to live with us they thought she was the oldest and then got hell confused about there being another one. Too many fkn siblings to keep up with. Seeing her irl has helped a lot and they seem to kinda get it, but now keep asking why she doesn’t live with us and being super curious about her and all the history with her. 8 was like “does she know mum?” lmao. But I mean she forgets that Matt knows mum and will sometimes be mansplaining stuff about her to him and he’s like… yeah she’s my mum too. Lol. Makes sense tho bc Matt left home before 8yr old was a conscious human. She asks him about dad alllll the time bc in her head, him and dad were both gone for as long as she can remember so she thinks they were in the same place. 

Was actually hell interesting to see Sis 2’s personality when our oldest sister was there. Like she was pretty protective about the kids and seemed to be maybe making a point that she is involved with them? Idk, there was a vibe there that isnt usually there. It was kind of like seeing her with someone older than her that she was in a way wanting to prove something to or get approval from, or like prove she was grown up maybe? Its hard to describe. But I noticed it a ton. Only example I can think is when it was the 3 of us with the baby and I was like I better go change the baby’s nappy, and Sis 2 is like nah I got it dw and goes off with her. Like that does not happen on a normal day. And also when oldest sister asked 10yr old about her bike crash and 10 looked at me (bc she will cry if she has to talk about it) and before I can say anything, Sis 2 is like yeah it was so bad, starts explaining the whole thing and talking about the ED visit like she was there. She was literally away at work🤣 I didnt mind tbh, Matt thought I was gonna be pissed off, but it was just funny to me. Like trying to show how involved she is when she’s not really. Not with the little kids. She tells kids off and she helps when the teenagers are being crazy and like will go give them speeches about respecting me if they are being dickheads but she doesnt change nappies and kiss boo boos. 

It was kinda hard to say goodbye to oldest sis, it was nice in a way to have all 10 of us together. But I also know we are no where near at a stage where we could spend a significant amount of time with her as there are a lot of underlying issues. But it was a nice baby step and I’m relieved she’s not as psycho irl as she can be on text. And hopefully our relationship will be better now and maybe can have more visits (but not any time soon bc I’m emotionally drained and exhausted) 

Anyways this has been a fkn essay but had a lot to say I guess. I’ll leave it there bc my thumbs hurt. 3 weeks of a shit load of emotions and I am soo done and ready to have a bit of normal for a while, or as normal as it can be in a 9 people house 🫠 Just waiting for the kids to get used to school again so I can actually enjoy the break whilst they are there instead of anxiously waiting for the “your kid is inconsolable” phone call and having to go rescue my lil munchkin girl",42,1753785671.0,u_hannahJ004,4,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Toronto Blue Jays vs. Baltimore Orioles: A Same-Game Parlay for the Ages**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans—or, more accurately, a clash of a titan (Toronto) and a team that’s still figuring out how to charge their starting pitcher’s phone (Baltimore). The Blue Jays, fresh off a 10-4 loss that had fans wondering if their offense had been replaced by a group of accountants, host the Orioles, who are on a two-game winning streak but have a starting pitcher, Zach Eflin, whose ERA (5.78) could double as a recipe for a spicy salsa. Let’s break this down with the precision of a retired math teacher and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The moneyline has the Blue Jays at **+213** (decimal: 2.13) and the Orioles at **-267** (decimal: 1.73). Translating that into implied probabilities: Toronto’s 47% chance to win vs. Baltimore’s 57%. The spread? The Orioles are favored by 1.5 runs, but their price (-150) suggests bookmakers aren’t fully buying into their “hot streak.” The total is set at **10.5 runs**, with even money on Over/Under. The SportsLine model, which claims to have “seen strong returns” this season, is leaning Over, projecting 9.7 combined runs.

Key stats:

* **Chris Bassitt** (Toronto’s starter) has a 3.88 ERA and a 11-4 record. He’s been a July machine, with five straight quality starts.
* **Zach Eflin** (Baltimore’s starter) is a human sprinkler system: 5.78 ERA, 1.45 WHIP. His ERA is so high, it could qualify as a public service announcement for sunscreen.
* Toronto’s offense (5th in MLB in runs per game) vs. Baltimore’s pitching (25th in ERA). It’s like pitting a Ferrari against a team of ice cream trucks.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Eflin’s Existential Crisis

The Blue Jays are dealing with a hangover from their 10-4 loss to the Tigers—a game where their offense looked more interested in napping than scoring. But don’t count them out: They’re still 63-43 and lead the AL East by 5.5 games. Chris Bassitt, their “ace” (if “ace” is a term of endearment for a pitcher who’s just trying not to embarrass himself), is due for another solid start.

The Orioles? They’ve won two in

It’s a strawberry açaí made with black tea instead of water. No other customizations. Over the last 1-1/2 years obviously the price of all drinks has gone up. But the quality has taken a hit. Maybe it’s specific to this Starbucks around me but it’s always something. This drink isn’t shaken. I ask for light ice, I get 2.7 ice cubes. No black tea. Not strawberries. It’s always something anymore. Sometimes I’ll ask for a cup of ice if I notice it before I leave and I feel like they are going through the most major inconvenience they have ever experienced. I’m not one to really complain but after almost 2 years watching the price of this drink go from 5 and some change to 6.95 now and it’s progressively getting worse has I guess lead me to ask, is it my specific Starbucks? Am I an asshole for asking my drink to be remade over said issues I have brought up? I used to work here for a very short time period and I feel like the refreshers aside from brewed coffee are some of the easier drinks to make. Idk. Maybe it’s just me.

I just stopped ignoring my cells.

I wasn’t on some wellness quest.

There was no spiritual awakening on a yoga retreat in the Andes.

I just got tired of being tired Every Single Day.

I wasn’t depressed. I wasn’t sleep-deprived.

I wasn’t even that unhealthy — or so I thought.

But my energy levels? Fluctuating harder than crypto.  
My brain? Like trying to load Netflix on dial-up.  
Mood? Somewhere between “meh” and “don’t talk to me until 11 am.”

So I gave myself a simple challenge:  
Fix my energy without becoming one of those people who talk about “cold plunges” before coffee.

Just small tweaks, Minimal changes.

See what works.

And more importantly, figure out why my body was stuck in low-power mode.

What did I find? I wasn’t lazy or broken.

I was just missing a few key nutrients — the kind your body desperately needs but no one talks about until it’s too late.

Here are the 7 sneaky deficiencies that were low-key ruining my energy — and what I did to finally stop feeling like a tired blob pretending to be a functioning adult.



# 1. Magnesium — AKA “The Calm Chemical” Your Brain’s Begging For

If magnesium were a person, it’d be the chill friend who helps everyone else calm down and get their stuff together — but never gets credit.

Turns out, magnesium helps with over 300 things in your body (sleep, muscle recovery, mood, energy, etc.), and I was probably getting about… none of it.

After adding magnesium glycinate at night?  
I was sleeping more deeply, waking up less anxious, and my “resting doom-scroll” urge first thing in the morning stopped. Wild.



# 2. B12 — Because My Brain Had No Business Running on Fumes

B12 is essential for energy, brain function, and nervous system support.

I wasn’t deficient on paper — my bloodwork was “technically fine” — but my body disagreed.

I started taking a quality methylated B12, and within a few days, I noticed I could think straight again.

Like someone cleared the fog off my windshield. I wasn’t smarter. Just… present.



# 3. CoQ10 — The Spark Plug I Didn’t Know I Needed

CoQ10 sounds like a Marvel villain, but it’s something your mitochondria (cellular engines) need to produce energy.

Think of it this way: eating food gives your body gas.

But without CoQ10, your cells can’t turn the ignition.

Once I started supplementing with it? I felt the difference.

More natural energy, less caffeine dependence, and the afternoon slump wasn’t hitting like a truck anymore.



# 4. NAD+ Precursors — The Stuff That Keeps Your Cellular Battery Charged

Okay, NAD+ isn’t sexy.

It doesn’t have influencers promoting it in a bikini. But your body depends on it to do basically everything, especially turning food into fuel.

The catch? NAD+ drops as you age, even in your 30s.

Which is rude.

I started using a supplement that includes NAD+ precursors (like NR), and it felt like someone plugged me into a wall charger.

Not hyper. Just steady, actual energy — without the crash.



# 5. L-Carnitine — The Uber Driver for Your Fat

Here’s something fun: your body can’t burn fat for energy if it doesn’t move the fat to where it gets burned.

That’s what L-Carnitine does — it’s a fatty acid chauffeur.

Once I added it in? My metabolism felt smoother.

I wasn’t starving all the time. I didn’t feel puffy or bloated by 2 p.m. And my energy didn’t feel like it was running off pure adrenaline anymore.



# 6. Electrolytes — It’s Not Just a Hangover Cure

I used to think being hydrated meant drinking more water.

I was wrong.

You need electrolytes — sodium, potassium, magnesium — to absorb that water and help your cells function.

Otherwise, you’re just peeing more and wondering why you’re still tired.

I started adding a pinch of sea salt and trace minerals to my water in the morning.

Felt weird.

Worked great.

I don’t get that weird head pressure anymore, and my focus improved noticeably.



# 7. PQQ — Mitochondria Magic (But Make It Science)

This one’s a bit niche, but stick with me: PQQ helps your body grow more mitochondria.

Yes, that’s a real thing.

It’s like upgrading from one dim lightbulb to a fully lit studio apartment — inside your body.

I started taking it as part of a stack with CoQ10 and NAD+ stuff, and within a week, I felt more clear-headed, more motivated, and didn’t need to crawl into bed at 4 p.m. like a Victorian orphan.



# Final Thoughts: You’re Not Lazy. You’re Probably Just Low On Something Important.

Look, I don’t think any of us need more “grind” culture.

We’re grinding enough.

But we do need better energy — and that starts way deeper than just “get more sleep” or “drink more water.”

If you feel off — mentally, physically, emotionally — it might not be your schedule or your mindset.

It might just be your cells asking for help.

And if you’re anything like I was — running on caffeine, vibes, and the occasional banana — then giving your mitochondria some backup might be the best decision you make all year.

No detox.

No rabbit hole.

Just support what your body already wants to do.

Start small.

Start smart.

Start with fuel that actually works.
