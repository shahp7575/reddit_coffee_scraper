1hg9ebh,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1hg9ebh/my_top_ten_starbucks_in_japan/,My Top Ten Starbucks in Japan,"As a tourist who happens to be a photographer, I am almost always up at sunrise when in another country. And as much as I might want to avoid it, Japan's general cafe opening hours of nine/ten in the morning are not early enough and I end up in a Starbucks every other day. But despite my severe reservations about partaking in American coffee while in Japan and my massive desire to 'eat/drink like a local' I discovered that most of the people in Starbucks, in Japan, are Japanese. It helped to ease my guilt.

Before I get into my top ten, I should mention one major difference between branches where I am from (Glasgow, Scotland) and those across the great nation of Japan; everyone buses their own tray. You should too.

Here's the countdown, based purely on personal preference;

**10. Starbucks Coffee - Kaminarimon**

You'd think the Starbucks closest to Senso-ji would be constantly busy and whilst that can be true, hit this place up at just the right time and it becomes a haven away from the crowds with a surprisingly spacious upstairs and an alright view of the Kaminarimon Gate if you nab a corner window seat. Staff have especially good English skills and endless patience.

**9. Starbucks Coffee - Takayama Okamoto**

In the unlikely event that you tire of the charm of eastern Takayama's old town and hida beef on a stick. Head out of the other side of the train station and just beyond the bowling alley and amusement arcade you will find this very modern branch, complete with drive-thru. The perfect reminder of Japan as a land of constrast.

**8. Starbucks Coffee - Shibuya, Fire-dori Street**

Shibuya Crossing Starbucks is hugely overrated and though you can take two good photos from here (one horizontal and one vertical) looking down onto the intersection, there's a better outlet nearby that only locals know about. Just five minutes walk towards Harajuku and past two other Starbucks you'll find the Fire-dori Street branch with a nice view of the Yamanote Line crossing a road. Also a great place to shake your fist at tourists passing by in go-karts.

**7. and 6. Starbucks Coffee - Osaka Castle Park/Osaka Castle Park Morinomiya**

I know, I know, I'm cheating here by putting two that are in the same location. Both are on the east side of the castle and served by JR and Metro lines. The Osaka Castle Park branch has more of a commuter vibe while the southern Morionomiya branch is for dog walkers and regular people walkers. Both are perfect for a pick-me-up after sunrise photos but be careful of the different closing times if you're there late on in the day (northern branch closes at ten while the other closes earlier at nine).

**5. Starbucks Coffee - Karuizawa Prince Shopping Plaza**

I like to talk a lot of shit about Karuizawa generally. But this Starbucks is the best cafe in Japan for big, fluffy dog watching. And as such deserves a place on this list. Get lucky and you might also see the big, fluffy dogs scare their small, yappier brethren. And as with the Kaminarimon branch; great english and endless patience.

**4. Starbucks Coffee - Shinjuku 3(San)-chome**

You're staying in Shinjuku and want a reliable coffee from near your hotel but those around the station are simply too busy for your liking? Shinjuku 3(San)-chome has you covered, the perfect balance of busy and not busy. Get there early enough and watch people walk to work while you plan your day of leisure. But be warned that the word is out about this formerly unknown spot for locals. You might not be the only gaijin in the place if that's what you're looking for.

**3. Starbucks Coffee - Kawagoe Kanetsuki-dori Street**

The new reigning 'in-keeping-with-local-aesthetic' champion. More people were taking photos of this Starbuks than the nearby historical bell tower. Really lovely outdoor area out the back too. Recommended while you wait for your turn to make chopsticks.

**2. Starbucks Coffee - Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden**

You've finished your Makoto Shinkai pilgramage to Shinjuku, seen the *Your Name* steps and looked around the National Garden for the gazebo. What better way to take a load off than with perhaps the best Starbucks outdoor area in Japan? One whole side of the building offers park views but be warned; the seats are in high demand and you may end up with the students cramming their studies on the communal tables instead.

**1. Starbucks Coffee - Shinshu Zenkoji Nakamise-dori Street**

The former 'in-keeping-with-local-aesthetic' title holder is still one of the more surprising branches out there. It's wooden facade might match the souvenir and soft-cream stores around it but inside is a decidely modern and spacious interior with one of the widest staircases I have ever walked up in Japan. It also holds a dear place in my heart as the first place I ever received a '**日本語 上手 ですね**' to which I responded with the obligatory '**まだまだ**'. Hence the number one placing, the pull of bias was simply too strong.

The timing couldn’t have been more perfect as last minute plans sprung up to visit friends around the country; one flying in from the United States to meet with mutual friends just outside Birmingham England, and more who live up in Glasgow Scotland. This trip happened at the end of November.

# Day 1: Tyne and Wear to Wellington - 214mi/344km

[Charging at Skelton Lake Services, Leeds](https://preview.redd.it/4s7gz5so6e7e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a4d1945f38fbc121afdc0160c8b3feb1014e908)

It’s raining, freezing temperatures, and it’s windy. It’s the worst possible scenario for any car, but especially an EV with an Iron Phosphate battery. I’m a responsible little gremlin and take regular breaks at least every two hours so I planned a stop at the new Skelton Lake services in Leeds as having never done a long journey in this car I was unsure how it would perform in poor weather at motorway speeds, thus I decided to get a top-up.

I connected to an Ionity brand charger and used my “Octopus Electroverse” card to initiate and pay for the charge. For those not in the know, my home energy provider (Octopus Energy) dished out free RFID cards for people on EV tariffs; at a supported charger you simply tap it as you would a debit or credit card and the charge will be billed to your electricity bill. Honestly fantastic and I wish it was universal given my account is constantly in credit. Regardless of what card you use, you simply connect the plug and tap once.

I only added 14.54kWh to the battery as I got a coffee and cinnamon bun in the frankly lovely Skelton Services (North Americans, take note, this is what a motorway stop should be rather than the depressing gas stations with half a Wendys stapled to them I had to endure in Canada and the north eastern US).

Everything simply worked. That makes for a boring post, but it truly did. After my brief layover I drove the remaining 129 miles in a single shot. Other than the dismal weather there was nothing wrong with the entire journey. If I hadn't have topped up, I would've arrived at my destination with, if I recall, between 10 to 12% remaining, putting the motorway range of this car at 240-ish miles / 386-ish km, or an efficiency rating of 2.9mi/kWh (4.6km/kWh). Given it was below freezing, exclusively at motorway speeds and with the heating on at a comfortable level I'm more than satisfied with that number.

# Day 2: England to Scotland - 282mi/453km

[Charging at Telford Services](https://preview.redd.it/3kd0pd7u6e7e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d79f3059d0f1ec1bc2fd784b4afa5df03fc8b78)

I left mid-day and the weather was still horrible, sadly (IE bloody freezing). I made my way to the Telford Services to charge my car using the heavily signposted and advertised Applegreen Chargers: up to 400kW delivery and a GIANT bank of them, too!

Surprise, surprise, I get there and there is only a construction site. Remember, these are already signposted and available on many charging maps. The only charging option were two ancient 50kW unit that still had a Chademo connector, as the Tesla chargers there weren’t open to all electrics yet (but I guess the construction was messing with those stations because they weren’t having a good time of it from the looks of things).

Still, despite the slow charge speed, the services were nice and warm and the charger was retrofitted with a debit card reader. I charged to 60% to give me enough to drive the 128mi/205km to another service station in Burton-In-Kendal. I’m glad I charged to 60 because I arrived with a scant 9% remaining! 128-ish miles using 51% of the battery is pretty great, IMO, given the conditions (freezing, windy, eventually rain, lots of hills), exclusively motorway speeds (70mph/112kph). I’m not going to grumble. This was around 3mi/kWh (4.8km/kWh).

[Charging at Burton-in-Kendal](https://preview.redd.it/yv3ghf4z6e7e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74cb82020d662ee7d4c3aa5aa0a18e2625fc356a)

[View from inside the Moto services of one of two large Gridserve charging banks.](https://preview.redd.it/314c8uh67e7e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a73ead9f9d7d3dfe2b9060019adb5807b796def4)

Cardinal sin, but I charged to 100% in Burton in Kendal as I chomped down on a burger. It was a giant bank of Gridserve units that were truly trivial to use, well sign posted and reasonably fast. I wanted this 150 mile leg of the journey done in one shot with plenty remaining as it was getting dark, it was still raining, windy, and the M74 had construction and later, rush hour traffic. Given a lot of the motorway is unlit as well it made for a truly miserable time on the road, but I kept the podcasts going and the cabin warm and just muscled through. I forget how much charge I had when I finally arrived (I believe it was 30%), but it wasn't great given the traffic, constant up-hill (Scotland and all that) and heavy wind; probably the least efficient portion of the trip, hovering around 2.6mi/kWh (4.19km/kWh).

# Day 4: Scotland to England - 164mi/264km

[Charging and Polmadie Siding Lane](https://preview.redd.it/vp3cuhga7e7e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b3ff7a566ce7065a02c30735d8e178efcc8c069)

Two nights in Glasgow and it was time to leave. I stopped at the Ionity charging station at Siding Lane in Polmadie. This was a much, much smaller services, but the Starbucks was fine and the little ASDA express had some other amenities inside like a Greggs and warm places to sit. There was a little bit of a queue here as people had abandoned their cars to do whatever it was they were doing despite the charge being complete. Mercifully it was only a 15 minutes wait. The only confusion here was the card reader; there was only one and it was located on a post between charger two and three rather than on the dispenser itself. Strange, but fine. It caught a few people off guard for sure.

I also charged to 100% again as there was no queue behind me and I wanted to do the trip in one shot with plenty remaining. Like every other trip, it just worked, with the only negatives being the terrible weather and one quirk of my car: there’s no low washer fluid warning (the manual suggests periodically checking manually) so I had to pull into a layby on the A69. Again, I’m a responsible little gremlin so I had a full bottle of ready-to-use washer fluid in the boot.

Total cost of charging: £145.16 - before tax this is €145.19 / US$152.24 / C$217.42 / AU$240.13

It’s expensive, sure, but cheaper than petrol, especially in a car of similar performance (500hp+ / 390kW). Part of the problem is the tax rate has yet to be adjusted for public charging, so it’s at the full 20% rate instead of 5% for other fuel types.

Of course, I'd much rather take the damn train, and if I wasn't going only to Glasgow I would've done given a ticket was only £15.

To give a comparison with the Tesla Model 3 Dual Motor (that my older Brother owns), you're looking at around a 30mi/48km discrepancy in favour of the Tesla for a similar trip, albeit I have the power on par with the Model 3 Performance, of which ""real world"" figures on the internet suggest I'm within margin of error; Inside EVs did a winter test and had achieved 218mi from their Model 3 performance, for example, Bjørn Nyland achieved 211mi (albeit at a slightly higher speed of 74mph), where my least efficient portion of the trip would've achieved 214mi.

Overall I clearly needn’t worry about range in the future, and to a certain degree pricing. Long trips are more than viable and the amenities at motorway charging points are comfortable and sometimes (like with Skelton) excellent. Unless you live in the middle of a cornfield in nowhere USA, you've really got no excuse to go electric even for long trips.",1,1734437813.0,electricvehicles,0,1.0,False

1hg954p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dkfinance/comments/1hg954p/kritik_af_anders_bæk_analyse_samt_nordnet_hjælp/,Kritik af Anders Bæk analyse samt nordnet - Hjælp med at skriv til nordnet ,"Min analyse af Anders Bæks dybdegående Tesla analyse. Vi lever alle i AI-Epoken, men også i influencer epoken. Måske AI-Influencer Epoken.

Anders Bæk har udgivet denne analyse [https://www.andersbm.dk/tesla-kursmal/](https://www.andersbm.dk/tesla-kursmal/) blandt andet på Nordnet's blog og hvis du ligesom mig synes den er lidt skidt, så må du gerne hjælpe med at tage den ned ved at skrive til Nordnet.

Anders Bæk er en influencer, og hans seneste analyse, er ikke en analyse. Det er en bull case for Tesla. Det skal han holdes op på, når han serverer analyser for detailinvestorer. Specielt når han analyser en aktie som i den grad er spekulativ, og allerede er på en valuation der er helt uden fortilfælde.

Hvis du ligesom mig finder det enormt kritisk at en influencer som Anders Bæk helt ufiltreret får lov at levere den slags analyser på bl.a. Nordnet, så kan i sammen med mig sende en email til Nordnet (hvor Anders Bæk er blogger).

Nordnet er qua deres stærke brand med til at positionere Anders Bæk som en ekspert. Nordnet har et ansvar for at levere en hvis form for kvalitet på deres blogs, da man må gå ud fra at der er flere detailinvestorerer der finder deres investeringsråd samt inspiration på deres blog.

""Hej Nordnet

Jeg skriver for at udtrykke alvorlige bekymringer over Tesla-analysen, der for nylig blev offentliggjort via jeres platform af Anders Bæk. Som hobby investor finder jeg kvaliteten og metodikken i denne analyse dybt bekymrende. Jeg vil gå så langt ikke at kalde det en analyse, men en Tesla Bull Case.

Analysen indeholder flere grundlæggende fejl og vildledende oplysninger, herunder:

Anders Bæk har leveret flere analyser med price targets, uden at nævne han har leveret flere analyser. Det er vildledende og det bør helt klart inkluderes i hans indlæg på Nordnet fremover.

Blander Monte Carlo Simulation ind i en grundlæggende scenarieanalyse.

Får lukket Waymo ned om 2 år uden at begrunde det.

Laver ikke-understøttede forudsigelser om niveau 5-autonomi i 2025.

Præsenterer vildledende sammenligninger af bilindustriens gæld.

Ignorerer tab af markedsandele & salgstal i nøgleregioner.

Cherry-picking af data for at understøtte en alt for bullish fortælling.

Dette kan vildlede detailinvestorer, der stoler på nordnets dømme kraft. Jeg vil opfordre jer til at implementere stærkere kvalitets kontrol med det indhold i tillader på jeres blog, eller at ændre navnet på det til ""Tesla Bull Case"".

Venlig Hilsen""

**Disclaimer**: Ikke et personligt angreb på Anders Bæk, men fagligheden her er ikke OK mener jeg. Jeg tror desuden sagtens at Anders vil kunne levere noget der var mere ""well rounded"".

Det er min forhåbning af Anders ser det her som en omgang feedback og at han skruer gevaldigt op for tvivlen og ned for hans selvsikkerhed i hans analyser.

Her er kritik punkter af hans seneste dybdegående analyse fra folk rundt omkring på forskellige sociale medier der svarer på Anders Bæk's post. Nogle af dem er direkte copy pastet og ikke skrevet af mig.

𝐇𝐚𝐫 𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐞𝐣𝐥, 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐬å 𝐛𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐥𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐞𝐧 𝐧𝐲, 𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧 𝐚𝐭 𝐧æ𝐯𝐧𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐭𝐢𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐫 𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐟𝐞𝐣𝐥.

Hvorfor overhovedet lave analyser med price targets når du bare udgiver en ny, når din gamle ikke holder?

Det virker meget utroværdigt. Så skriv dog i din disclaimer at du også for x år siden lavede en analyse der gik på x, men den ikke holdte.

Anders Bæk har haft ret 8 år i træk..... Vidunderligt. Hvis man dog bare havde en fjerde del af den selvtillid.

Citat: ""𝘑𝘦𝘨 𝘩𝘢𝘳 𝘷æ𝘳𝘦𝘵 𝘮𝘦𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘴𝘬𝘳å𝘴𝘪𝘬𝘬𝘦𝘳 𝘱å 𝘢𝘵 𝘛𝘦𝘴𝘭𝘢 𝘷𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘷æ𝘨𝘦 𝘴𝘪𝘨 𝘴𝘰𝘮 𝘫𝘦𝘨 𝘩𝘢𝘳 𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘶𝘥𝘴𝘦𝘵 𝘪 𝘮𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘭𝘺𝘴𝘦𝘳. 𝘋𝘦𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘳 𝘥𝘦𝘯 𝘯𝘶 𝘨𝘫𝘰𝘳𝘵 𝘪 𝘥𝘦 𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘴𝘵𝘦 8 å𝘳 𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘯 2017.""

Han har forudset valget i guds eget land, Donald Trump, samt at Elon Musk ville blive en del af hans inderkreds.. Hvorfor ikke 8 år mere?

**Blander Monte Carlo Simulation ind i en grundlæggende scenarieanalyse.**

En komprimeret monte carlo simulation er Anders bæk ude i.

Jeg har meget svært ved at forstå denne del af hans analyse skulle bringe noget som helst udover den er forvirrende og det faktisk ville være mere korrekt bare at lave en normal scenarie analyse. Alle nøgle variablerne er sat, der er kun volumen der skifter..

F.eks. der er ingen korrelationer imellem nogen af de her input variabler?

Der mangler vel også sandsynligheder eller distributioner?

Hvad er meningen her, udover at det kan få Anders til at fremstå en smule mere begavet? Er der nogen der kan hjælpe mig til at forstå det? tager jeg fejl?

""For hvert år mellem 2025 til 2029 har jeg lavet 100 simuleringer og udtaget median-værdien samt 25. og 50. procentil.""

Er median-værdien ikke 50.0 procentil? Jeg forstår ikke ovenstående sætning.

Måske han mener 75. percentil?

Det svarer til at lave en vejr analyse med forskellige faste input. 5 Grader Celcius, x luftfugtighed, x vind m/s, x chance for regn. Lav 100 simulationer. Det er bare tilfældige tal mellem min og max værdier. Spændende? Relevant?

Der er ingen korrelationer mellem parametrene temperatur, luftfugtighed, chance for regn osv.

Her er en fortolkning af min vejr analyse...... Spændende? blah mjah wahh tjah? vurder selv

**Temperatur:**

\- Gennemsnit omkring 15°C (midt mellem min og max)

\- Varierer fra ca. 5°C til 25°C som forventet

25% af værdierne ligger under ca. 10°C

Medianen ligger omkring 15°C

75% af værdierne ligger under ca. 20°C

**Luftfugtighed:**

\- Gennemsnitlig luftfugtighed omkring 60%

\- Spænder fra 40% til 80%

**Vindhastighed**:

\- Gennemsnitlig vindhastighed omkring 7 m/s

\- Varierer fra 2 m/s til 12 m/s

**Chance for regn:**

\- Gennemsnitlig chance for regn omkring 45%

\- Varierer fra 10% til 80%

**Konkurrenten Waymo lukker om 2 år.**

Citat (AB):""Jeg ser det som meget sandsynligt at Waymo vil blive nedlagt inden for de næste 2 år.""

Det er ikke helt klart hvorfor han ser det som meget sandsynligt, man må forstå at Teslas ""generelle"" & ""skalerbare"" tilgang er bedre.

Citat (AB):""Generelt svarer Waymos og Baidus tilgang lidt til en bowlingspiller, der spiller med usynlige banter og derfor altid kan lave strikes. Det ser imponerende ud for tilskuerne, men virkeligheden er en anden.""

Det kunne måske være et sted hvor en AI-Ekspert og Civilingeniør kunne slå til og faktisk forklare eller uddybe de teknologiske forskelle imellem Waymo & Tesla og hvorfor at Waymo er så håbløst at det lukker om 2 år. Der er meget her omkring Lidar teknologi, radar m.m. hvor Anders kunne have budt ind.

Det var måske værd at nævne i en dybdegående analyse at Waymo har lukket en funding runde på 5.6 billion USD i Oktober 2024. Det er under 3 måneder siden...

Herefter en video af en sammenligning mellem Tesla & Waymo der begge kører samme sted hen, men Teslaen er meget hurtigere, der bliver bare ikke nævnt at Waymo er geo-fenced og ikke kan køre på motorvej.

""Jeg skal være ærlig og sige jeg kun har læst delen om selvkørende biler, da jeg tidligere har været efter dig for ikke at underbygge din påstand om at Tesla var førende på selvkørende teknologi. Jeg havde håbet på denne underbyggelse her, men blev skuffet. - Du bruger Anthony Levandowsky til at forsøge at underminere Waymo. Han har ikke været en del af Waymo siden 2016 og har været i fængsel for at stjæle deres teknologi. - du nævner indsamlet data som den afgørende faktor for Teslas fordel og vurderer at Waymo er nedlagt om 2 år (!! vanvittig påstand btw). Hele pointen med Waymos strategi er jo netop, at de ikke mener man bare kan feede nok data og så kan biler køre overalt, som er drømmen for Tesla der altid er liiige om hjørnet. Men måske det slet ikke kan lade sig gøre. Og i mellemtiden kører Waymo rundt, uden indgriben på de fleste turer, i et voksende antal byer. - du har vedhæftet en video, der viser hvor meget langsommere en Waymo er på samme rute som en Tesla. Du nævner ikke at Waymo er programmeret til ikke at tage motorvej. De fokuserer ubetinget på sikkerhed og tager det juridiske ansvar for eventuelle ulykker. Helt modsat Tesla, der frasiger sig alt ansvar for brugen af FSD og på den luller chauffører ind i en falsk tryghed, der koster ulykker (og har kostet liv). Forøvrigt nægter Tesla at udgive data angående ulykker, der er sket under FSD. Jeg forstår stadig ikke hvordan du så skråsikkert kan påstå, at Tesla skulle være så langt fremme på selvkørende teknologi...""

Det går hurtigere at køre på motorvej, end på en normal vej. Selv tak.

Det var så analysen af en af de større(Måske største konkurrent robocab wise) konkurrenter til Tesla.

**Level 5 autonomi i 2025 med 65% chance.**

Det er jo bare et helt vildt claim og noget som Elon musk har forudset mange gange, lidt ligesom jehova har meldt verden ned mange gange.

Jeg kalder ham selv ud på det og tilbyder ham væddemål hvor en value investor som Anders Bæk, naturligvis burde trykke til den. Han virker ikke til at være helt overbevist om hans sandsynligheder her.

**Vildledende sammenligninger af gæld under overskriften ""Verdens mest forgældede selskaber"" & ""blodbad i bilindustrien"".**

Konkurrende bilproducenter som f.eks. Toyota og Ford fungerer essentielt som banker og har udlån på deres balance sheet. Som minimum kunne man måske servere den kontekst inden man skriver ""blodbad"" i en dybdegående analyse.

Så vidt jeg ved har Tesla ikke udlån på deres balance sheet, eller også har de meget lidt, og det er noget som de lige er begyndt på fornyligt. Før hen har de haft finansielle partnere som Wells Fargo der har stået for lån til køb af Teslaer.

Der står b.l.a at ""Toyota har verdens største gæld på 213 Mia USD"" men mon ikke de har haft adgang til noget meget favorable lånevilkår i japanske yen.

**Teslas salgsta**

Hvorfor skulle man indlede en pris krig når man essentielt har evigt efterspørgsel

Det giver ikke rigtig mening..

Citat (AB): ""Jeg har hørt mange investorer og analytikere, der har troet, at efterspørgslen efter Teslas biler er dalende. Det er en forkert antagelse. Tesla har aldrig oplevet at være begrænset af efterspørgslen – de har derimod altid kun været begrænset af deres egen produktionskapacitet.

Med andre ord: Tesla sælger deres biler, lige så hurtigt som de kan produceres. ""

Der startes ud med: Citat (AB): ""Tesla kan sælge så mange biler som de kan producere"". Det følges op med: Citat (AB): ""Salgstallene i 2024 forventes at ligge på samme niveau som året før"". Tesla kommer om få år, ifølge analysen, til at DOMINERE bilmarkedet. De kan også sælge så mange biler som de kan producere, må man forstå. Men de vælger bare at lade være, med at producere flere, eftersom at salget går i stå? Eller hvordan skal man læse udviklingen?

Citat (AB): ""Tesla har tidligere på året udtalt, at 2024 vil være et overgangsår ""mellem to vækstbølger"", og at salget derfor forventes at ligge på niveau med sidste års salgstal. Samtidig har de annonceret, at en ny ""vækstbølge"" forventes at starte i 2025. Detaljerne er endnu sparsomme, men vi ved, at denne kommende vækstbølge vil omfatte opdaterede bilmodeller samt en ny revolutionerende produktionsmetode. ""

Hvis man åbner de øvrige bilfabrikanters regnskaber, så vil jeg godt vædde en hat af mug, samt en Oslotur med dobbelt Irish coffee servering på, at de også snakker om nye produktionsmetoder, opdaterede bilmodeller og lignende. Det er vel for helvede standard. I modsætning til Tesla, så har de andre det dog rent faktisk med at gøre hvad de prædiker (til en vis grad - der er ingen der er super fine på det punkt på børsen - salgsgas muss sein). At efterlade et citat fra Elon Musk og rent faktisk acceptere det som sandhed, er jo skørt. Manden er vel nærmest allermest kendt for, at ingen af hans timelines nogensinde holder.

Den graf der efterfølgende præsenteres over salgstal, er lidt komisk. Vi har at gøre med et bilmærke, der flirter med negativ vækst i salget. Man præsenterer så en graf, hvor den pessimistiske case, er ca. en fordobling af salget på 3 år. Hvorfor ikke en femdobling, når nu vi er i gang? :)

Det må alligevel være vildt, at være så fartblind overfor et selskab, at den mest negative case man kan komme frem til, er en nærmest absurd vækst.

**Tesla iPhoneficeret**

Det er noget sludder at påstå, at dette skulle være tilfældet. Du kan ikke gøre ved en bil, hvad Apple gjorde ved telefonen. Det Apple reelt lykkedes med var at skabe en enhed og et univers, hvorfra man kunne løse en helt absurd mængde opgaver. Alt fra læsning af mails, internet surfing, kalender, lommeregner, spille spil, aktiehandel, banking, TV-kiggeri, sociale medier, musikstyring, styring af vores hus (smart funktioner) og jeg kunne blive ved. Alle disse og tons vis af andre funktioner, forudså Apple at mobiltelefonen ville være centrum omkring og de byggede et univers der kunne understøtte dette.

Hvis man tror at det var fordi de byggede en enhed uden knapper, som kunne opdateres via internettet, at de fik succes, så tager man fejl. Bevares, den del er skide smart og det er sådan set smart nok i en Tesla også. Men det var ikke der kimen til successen blev lagt.

Jeg har selv en Tesla, så jeg hader på ingen måder deres brand, Elon Musk etc. Det er en glimrende bil. Bemærk at jeg sagde bil. Den kører mig fra A til B og den gør ikke andet. Min bror har elbil fra VW. Jeg synes min Tesla er bedre, men det er med et mulehår og noget vi kan skændes meget om. Jeg er langt fra overbevist om, at det er en Tesla jeg skal have næste gang.

Jeg har lige tjekket og jeg skammer mig næsten lidt over, at mit gennemsnitlige daglige brug af min telefon er på lidt over 5 timer. Jeg kan afsløre, at mit gennemsnitlige daglige brug af min Tesla er præcis den tid det tager mig at køre derhen, hvor jeg nu skal hen. Præcis på samme måde som det altid har været. Den del kommer ikke til at ændre sig og de use-cases som telefonen har vist sig leveringsdygtig i over årene kommer bilen ALDRIG i nærheden af. Simpelthen fordi vi ikke har den i lommen.

De sidste 100 år er bilen blevet løbende forbedret. Nogle gange med større spring. Tesla har indiskutabelt leveret et af disse større spring med deres elbiler, men der er ikke en afgrundsdyb forskel på kvaliteten af bilen/funktionerne, og de behov som Teslas biler lige nu kan opfylde kontra konkurrenterne. Ja, flere statistikker viser endda at Teslas biler ikke klarer sig specielt godt ved syn og lign., hvilket nu ikke er åndsvagt overraskende, når vi trods alt stadig snakker om en ung producent.

At skrive (om iphonificeringen) Citat (AB): ""Problemet for de traditionelle bilfabrikanter som VW, Toyota, GM, Ford etc. er, at de ikke forstår dette""..... tangerer arrogance. Selvfølgelig forstår de det. Måske er de bare ikke enige? Den mest solgte elbil i Danmark i sidste måned var en Skoda. Havde Apple det problem, da de først kom i gang? Måtte Apple prisdumpe som sindssyge for at komme af med alle de telefoner deres fabrikker producerede, så de kunne tjene penge på deres app store?

Nej. Må Tesla det? Ja, helt evident. STOP! FULDT STOP! Hvis nogen formaster sig til at sige idiotiske ting som: ""Tesla sænkede kun prisen, så de rigtig kunne give folkevogn een på skrinet"", så skal du (ja, dig, hvis det er dig der sidder derude og tænker det) tie stille. Der er kun een årsag til, at man sænker prisen, og det er fordi at efterspørgslen ikke er stor nok ved det tidligere prispunkt. Hvad fortæller det os? Det fortæller os, at Tesla ikke er noget vidunder og at Tesla deltager i helt fair og præcis konkurrence med de øvrige producenter og at rigtig mange vælger biler, der ikke er en Tesla, når der skal elbil på gaflen. Taget i betragtning, at den mest solgte elbil herhjemme, som nævnt, var en Skoda i sidste måned, så burde det statement næsten være evident. Er tingene anderledes i USA? Måske. Forbliver de sådan? Tvivlsomt...

Jeg vil medgive, at Teslas produktionsfaciliteter og vertikale integration er en konkurrencefordel. Med der stopper sammenligningen så også i min bog. En tro på at andre ikke kan opnå sammenlignelige produktionsfordele, er også decideret tosset. Det tager tid, det kræver investeringer og alt det der. Men selvfølgelig kan det lade sig gøre.",0,1734436953.0,dkfinance,2,0.4,False

I've tried even cialis but only get redness and bad feelings in the chest.

2. Nausea

Fast forward and I now shampoo every other day / 2-3 times per week and my scalp is 90% clear and feels great. So basically from my experience the issues come from other factors - namely diet and your gut microbiome. From my experience, I started incorporating anti-fungal natural foods into my diet which has basically entirely solved my Seb Derm. I take 1 teaspoon of MCT C-8 Oil a day with my coffee, which is a derivative of coconut oil. Otherwise I take a high quality probiotic and occasionally garlic/ginger/vitamin D supplements and this has entirely solved my issues. Its about an imbalance of your gut bacteria and fungi. Whenever I got sick I used to take antibiotics, which basically wipe out your gut bacteria leading to fungal overgrowth, so you need equilibrium. Probiotic supplements, foods like Kefir and Kimchi work to restore balance which from my experience has improved Seb Derm, I also topically used to apply MCT C-8 oil which works very well, but the root imo is really diet and gut health.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rise in popularity of teeth whitening products, particularly the popular white stripes teeth whitening strips, has made many smile a little brighter. However, as their use increases, so does the importance of proper disposal methods, especially in a bustling city like New York. Many people might not think about how and where to dispose of these products, but it’s crucial for the environment and public health.

Improper disposal can lead to pollution and negatively affect wildlife. The components of these whitening products can contain harmful chemicals that, if not disposed of correctly, could seep into the ground or water systems. Here are a few reasons why proper disposal is so important:

- **Environmental Responsibility:** Living in a diverse ecosystem like NYC means that every little action counts. When you throw away used whitening strips in the trash without thinking, they can end up in landfills where they can take years to decompose. This can contribute to a growing waste problem.
- **Safety Concerns:** Many whitening products contain chemicals designed to produce quick results. If these products are not disposed of properly, they can pose a risk to those who inadvertently come into contact with them, including pets and small children.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Understanding and adhering to local waste disposal regulations is important. NYC has guidelines for hazardous waste disposal, and whitening strips could fall under these regulations due to their chemical composition. Following these rules helps keep the community safe.
- **Awareness and Education:** Knowing the right disposal methods for these products helps raise awareness about broader environmental issues. When you share your knowledge about proper waste disposal, you encourage others to follow suit, promoting a culture of responsibility.

Now that you understand why proper disposal is critical, let’s discuss how to do it effectively in NYC. Here are some practical steps:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Check the Packaging:** Always read the disposal instructions on the packaging. Many manufacturers provide guidance on how to dispose of their products safely.
- **Utilize Eco-Friendly Options:** More dental offices and stores are offering eco-friendly disposal programs. If possible, find a local provider who offers a safe drop-off for these types of waste.
- **Follow NYC Guidelines:** The NYC Department of Sanitation has specific instructions for the disposal of various products. Research their website or contact them for details on how to handle items like whitening strips safely.
- **Consider Recycling:** If the packaging is recyclable, be sure to clean it and place it in the correct bin. However, check to ensure the product itself cannot be recycled.

By taking the initiative to follow these disposal tips, you significantly contribute to reducing pollution and promoting a healthier environment in NYC. Remember, it’s not just about whitening your teeth; it's about keeping our city clean and safe for everyone.

Additionally, many people may not realize that the impact of chemical waste extends beyond the immediate vicinity. When chemicals from whitening products enter the waterways, they can alter aquatic ecosystems, harming fish and other wildlife. NYC is home to various water bodies, and protecting these resources is vital for maintaining biodiversity.

The conversation surrounding sustainability and responsible usage of products is growing, and engaging with it, especially regarding personal care products, can inspire change. Always stay informed about your impact on the planet. Encourage your friends and family to make conscientious choices about how they dispose of their teeth whitening products, including white stripes teeth whitening strips.

While achieving that dazzling smile is appealing, it’s equally important to consider how your choices affect the environment. With a little effort, you can ensure that your teeth whitening routine is not just effective but also eco-friendly. Let’s strive for brighter smiles and a cleaner, greener New York City together!

Tips for Maintaining a Bright Smile After Using Teeth Whitening Strips
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Keeping your smile bright after using teeth whitening strips is essential for maintaining that fresh look you’ve worked hard to achieve. Here are several effective tips that can help ensure your new, dazzling smile stays brilliant for a long time.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Establish a Consistent Oral Care Routine

The foundation of a bright smile is good oral hygiene. Make sure to brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily. It’s important to use a fluoride toothpaste, as fluoride helps strengthen your enamel and can prevent sensitivity often associated with teeth whitening.

### Choose the Right Toothbrush

Investing in a good quality toothbrush is key. A soft-bristled toothbrush can effectively clean your teeth without damaging your enamel or gums. Electric toothbrushes can also effectively remove plaque and surface stains, making them a great option.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Watch What You Eat and Drink

Your diet plays a significant role in the longevity of your whitening results. Here are a few foods and drinks to be aware of:

- **Coffee and Tea:** Both can stain your teeth over time. If you can’t go without your morning coffee, try to rinse your mouth with water afterward.
- **Red Wine:** Similar to coffee, red wine can lead to discoloration. Opt for white wine occasionally, as it’s less staining.
- **Dark Berries:** Delicious but potent in staining. Enjoy them in moderation and rinse your mouth with water after consuming.

### Hydrate with Water

Water not only helps keep you hydrated but also rinses away food particles and reduces the acidity in your mouth. Drinking plenty of water after meals can significantly help maintain your pearly whites.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Use Straw When Drinking Staining Beverages

To minimize contact between your teeth and staining beverages, consider using a straw. This simple change can reduce the chance of discoloration from dark liquids, helping to protect your bright smile.

### Limit Consumption of Stain-Causing Foods

In addition to drinks, certain foods can contribute to staining. Limit or counteract the following:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Sauces:** Ketchup, soy sauce, and balsamic vinegar can all lead to discoloration. Try to wipe your mouth with a napkin after eating to minimize their effect.
- **Curry and Tomato-Based Dishes:** These can cling to teeth and cause stains. Ensure you brush soon after eating these meals.

### Chew Sugarless Gum

Chewing sugarless gum can promote saliva production, which is essential for remineralizing your teeth and washing away food particles. Look for gums that contain xylitol, as it can help prevent cavity formation and keep your enamel protected.

### Regular Dental Check-ups

Don’t forget to schedule regular appointments with your dentist. Professional cleanings can help remove plaque and surface stains that you may not be able to reach with your regular brushing and flossing. Additionally, your dentist can provide you with personalized advice tailored to your dental health.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Be Mindful of Whitening Maintenance

If you wish to maintain an even brighter smile, consider using touch-up whitening products. However, consult your dentist before starting any additional whitening regimen to ensure it’s suitable for your teeth and gums.

### Stay Aware of Sensitivity

Teeth can become sensitive after whitening. If you notice discomfort, switch to a toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth. This can alleviate pain and promote your overall dental health following your whitening treatment.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
By adopting these simple yet effective habits, you can ensure that your smile remains as bright as when you first used teeth whitening strips. Remember, a little effort goes a long way in keeping your pearly whites dazzling and in great health!

### Conclusion

Ensuring the proper disposal of White Stripes teeth whitening products in NYC is a crucial step for both environmental sustainability and personal health. It’s important to remember that these products contain chemicals that, if not disposed of correctly, can harm our city’s waterways and wildlife. By following local regulations and using designated disposal facilities, you can contribute to a cleaner, greener New York while keeping your neighborhood safe.

Aside from responsible disposal, maintaining a bright smile after using teeth whitening strips is essential for maximizing the results. Simple practices like regular brushing and flossing, using a good-quality toothpaste, and scheduling routine dental check-ups can help keep your teeth looking their best. foods that naturally clean your teeth, such as apples or crunchy vegetables, can make a difference too. Limiting staining beverages—like coffee, tea, and red wine—will help maintain your newly brightened smile.

I hope my review helps.  
  
From April 2023 0 -> B2 Dec 2024 while working a full time job and having a life  
  
My partner is native and his family speaks only German, so I am in for a treat every coffee and dinner, so you understand my motivation is intertwined with desperation, I am also looking for a job here in Germany after immigrating from my Eastern European home and quitting my job and confort zone in the name of love.  
  
My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day.  
  
Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.  
  
What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:  
  
Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.  
  
3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.  
  
4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.  
  
5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.  
  
As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.  
  
If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv](https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv)  
  
I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.

1hg8wyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1hg8wyc/how_we_turned_sec_filing_analysis_into_a_scalable/,"How we turned SEC filing analysis into a scalable SaaS by solving ""boring"" problem nobody wanted to touch","When I tell people I built an AI tool that analyzes SEC filings, I usually get blank stares. Not exactly the sexy world of social media or crypto, right? But here's the thing about ""boring"" problems - they often hide incredible opportunities.

Picture this: I'm sitting at my desk at 2 AM, surrounded by coffee cups, manually comparing sections of a 150-page SEC filing to its previous version. Like many others in finance, I was hunting for those subtle changes that could signal major company shifts. That's when it hit me - we're all doing this same mind-numbing work manually. Why?

Instead of building another generic AI tool, I became obsessed with solving this one specific problem really well. Not kinda well. Not ""good enough."" But so well that even the most skeptical finance professionals would trust it.

The initial reaction from friends was lukewarm: ""SEC filings? That's pretty niche..."" ""Why not build something more exciting?"" ""How many people actually need this?""

But here's what they missed - when you solve a critical problem for a sophisticated audience, you don't need millions of users. You need the right users.

We spent months perfecting our core analysis engine. Every detail mattered:

* How do we handle years of different filing formats reliably?
* How do we ensure our AI catches subtle but crucial changes?
* How do we make complex financial data actually understandable?

Then came one of our strongest validation points yet - we posted on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42310165). If you know HN, you know they'll tear apart anything that's not rock solid. Instead, we hit the front page. Hundreds of finance professionals and developers signed up in 24 hours.

But here's where it gets interesting.

Our users started asking for more. Not random features, but logical extensions: ""This is great for 10-Ks, but can you do 8-Ks?"" ""What about Form 4s for insider trading?"" ""Could you add real-time alerts?""

Because we had built such a solid foundation, adding these features was natural. Each new filing type we added brought in a different type of user:

* Value investors for deep 10-K/10-Q analysis
* Traders needing 8-K breaking news alerts
* Form-4 insider trading watchers

The big lesson? Don't be afraid of ""boring"" problems. Find something painful enough that people will pay to solve it, and solve it so well that they can't imagine going back to the old way.

Here's what I wish I'd known at the start:

1. Narrow focus beats broad appeal every time
2. Complex problems are opportunities in disguise
3. The best product expansion comes from user pull, not founder push
4. ""Boring"" markets often have the most willing-to-pay customers

We're still evolving and adding features, but always with that same core philosophy at [DocDelta](https://docdelta.ca)  \- solve real problems extremely well, and growth will follow.

Would love to hear from other founders - what ""boring"" problem did you tackle that turned out to be a golden opportunity? What made you stick with it when others might have pivoted to something flashier?",2,1734436086.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False
1hg8vpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/RBpaddock/comments/1hg8vpg/is_orbr_the_paddock_the_best_formula_1_loyalty/,Is ORBR ‘The Paddock’ the best Formula 1 loyalty scheme?,"TLDR: Yes!

Oracle Red Bull Racing Formula 1 team have a loyalty scheme called ‘The Paddock’ and here’s how my VIP loyalty status was exceptionally rewarded.

Members of ‘The Paddock’ were invited to enter a competition to attend (with a guest) a year end live recording of the podcast ‘Talking Bull’ at ‘MK7’ (Featuring Christian Horner and Max Verstappen, hosted by Nicola Hume). 

Five winners were selected and I wasn’t one :(. 

However, I am a member of the ‘The Paddock’ VIP tier discord channel. Last Tuesday, I checked the channel and saw that the ‘The Paddock’ said they have a spare ticket for the event the following day and the first person to respond wins. I won! :). 

Wait, how am I going to get there? I live in North London so a quick search showed that it’s only an hour drive to Milton Keynes where the ORBR F1 team is based. Panic over.

Next quandary is who can I take the following day and who would be available? As time was of the essence (a name had to be given for security purposes), I decided to take my retired mother who has never been to anything Formula 1 related  (It was her birthday the prior week) .

Wednesday arrived and before you know it, we was enjoying barista style coffee in front of a Formula 1 car (An eco-friendly initiative across the campus is to bring a re-usabale cup which is a good measure). We were also each given an ORBR ‘The Paddock’ cap - nice touch.

I could see that there was a lot of activity and buzz around the whole building/campus as it was the team’s celebration photo day.

We was then introduced to a very knowledgeable guide (Juan, who kindly answered my numerous questions), who escorted us to the famous reception that houses all of the trophies (more on this later).

We then had a factory tour of the following areas (manufacturing, paintshop, electronics, the two giant autoclaves and assembly workshop). We both was super impressed by the scale of the operation and the insights given (I have also been to the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 campus and McLaren Technology Centre. The ORBR Factory Tour is far superior!). Factory tours (also inclusive of heritage bays, operations room, model shop, race bays) can be purchased, as well as screening events and others at [https://experiences.redbullracing.com](https://experiences.redbullracing.com).

After having lunch in the canteen we then headed back to the ‘MK7’ building for the podcast. With our welcome drink in hand (My mother went for a glass of Champagne :) ), we then viewed the fifteen formula 1 cars on display before heading up to the mezzanine level. The floor area was filled with 100 or so employees who have achieved 20 years of service with ORBR (Chapeau to them). 

This was where the day became even more epic! 4 time World Champion Max Verstappen only came to see us!!!! We had a quick chat and of course photos were taken :) I felt very privileged as a loyal member of The Paddock. Max was friendly and approachable, bearing in mind the amount of posing for photo’s etc. on that special team day.

Then the very interesting ‘Talking Bull’ live podcast started. Watch out for ORBR’s socials when this comes out. 

The day ended when the podcast recording finished…but not just yet. 

I wanted to go back to the world’s best reception (IMO) full of trophies to take some pics without people. It was even more spectacular at night as you can see from the pics. I then saw Christian Horner exiting the building so I managed to get a quick selfie to complete the day (thanks Christian :) ). 

To conclude, ORBR ‘The Paddock’ is the BEST Formula 1 loyalty scheme and Max/ORBR/F1 has my retired mother as a new fan. She even asked when is the next race? I replied that it’s Christmas, and the season has ended :). It just goes to show that Formula 1 has the ability to attract fans of all ages.

Special thanks to Brad, Elliot, Juan, Max, Christian and the whole ORBR F1 team!

I have provided some choice snaps from permitted areas (See next Pics post).

1hg8roz,https://i.redd.it/jikgzto2be7e1.jpeg,Got all these for winter(review),"Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa: smells similar to khamrah but more boozy. There is alot of alcohol smell at the very start which I dislike, but it mellows down into a rich boozy gourmand fragrance. it is hard to tell the coffee note, imagine the essence of a kopiko toffee but mellowed down to 30%. Still pretty sweet, boozy fragrance. Performance and longevity similar to khamrah. 8/10

Lattafa Asad: it tries to clone dior sauvage and is pretty successful in doing so. The only difference is it has a more prominent vanilla note which I like. I personally find dior sauvage overrated(no hate to depp the goat) and don't find the fragrance special in anyway. Ofcourse, the performance on sauvage is fucking which I recognise. I only bought asad as a filler decant so I avoid shipment charge, and I didn't expect to like it as I don't find sauvage that Amazing, but honestly? I prefer it's smell over the original haha. Longevity and sillage is pretty good, not as good as sauvage's tho. 8/10

Lattafa Khamrah: tries it's best to clone angel share, which I smelled recently at a perfume outlet, and I have to say it does a decent job at it. Again, like the qahwa the alcohol in the opening is wayyyy too strong for me, but It mellows down quickly. Matches angel share by like 80%. More boozy and spicy. Performance is absolutely fucking crazy on this one. Lasts for days on clothes and a full easy day on skin. Washed my hand like twice and can still smell it. 9/10

Afnan Rare Carbon: it tries to clone Tom Ford Ombre leather, which is my favourite fragrance btw, and it does a goodj job.. like clowns it 80-85%. The fruitiness of the originals Drydown is present. The performance is also good, not as good as the original tho. One big issue I have with it is the woody smell it gives off, which I've found to be common in all ombre leather clones that I've smelt(ie 002 man StudioWest, TM perfume house, EM5 etc etc) and the thing is, it's the exact woody smell in all of these. This woody smell is not present in ombre leather which shows it's a hard fragrance to copy. I do kinda dislike the woody smell and prefer ombre leather over all of these, even though it has a hefty price tag. Still, nice fragrance, absolutely nails the Drydown. 8.5/10

Afnan 9pm: amazing ultramale clone. Fresh, not as fruity as the original but nice. Average performance on my skin tho. Can definitely wear for a party or a nightout as it is a casual fragrance. Not much else to say about this one, came to get the job done and succeeded. 8.7/10

Darsh mittal the goat tho, smooth experience, straight to the point, polite and quick delivery. 9.5/10",14,1734435488.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,7,0.89,False

Ever wondered why Denmark consistently ranks among the happiest countries in the world? The answer lies in **hygge**, an untranslatable Danish concept that embodies warmth, coziness, and contentment in life's simple pleasures. In ""The Little Book of Hygge"" by Meik Wiking, CEO of the Happiness Research Institute, discover the art of creating a hyggelig (cozy) atmosphere anywhere.

**Key Aspects of Hygge:**

- **Atmosphere and Ambiance:** Candlelight is a central element. Danes lead Europe in candle consumption, using them to create inviting spaces.

- **Community and Togetherness:** Happiness thrives in social connections. Hygge emphasizes equality and shared experiences, from communal meals to cozy gatherings.

- **Simplicity and Accessibility:** True contentment doesn't require wealth. Hygge finds joy in simple, everyday moments — a hot cup of coffee, a good book, or a family game night.

- **Year-Round Experience:** While often associated with winter, hygge is a year-long celebration of the present moment, whether through summer picnics or holiday festivities.

By weaving hygge into daily life, we can all find a pathway to happiness, much like the Danes. **Explore how simple joys and togetherness can transform your outlook on well-being.**

Ready to embrace the hygge lifestyle? Listen to the ""20 Minute Books"" podcast episode for a deeper dive into the cozy heart of Denmark, or visit the website for more insights.

I've been very sedentary for the last few years. I used to do Taekwondo 3+ times a week and was very flexible + had no joint issues (besides lower back pain - I have Bertolotti's syndrome), so clearly being sedentary has made an impact. However, I'm starting to wonder if this level of joint weakness is normal.

My wrists start hurting so easily. I can't pat my dog too long because my hand/wrist will start hurting. I can't be on all fours because that position starts hurting my wrists. Throwing the ball for my dog too many times hurts my wrist and elbow. I consciously get a lighter coffee cup because holding the heavier one hurts my wrist. 

Then there's my knees and ankles... Squatting with 0 weight is too hard on my knees as is doing back bridges. I had bad pain in my left ankle after kicking a ball on my knee (didn't do anything weird with my ankle so no idea how that happened) and it's only been better after getting shoe inserts (mri of ankle showed inflammation). They're still sensitive though and standing on one leg is a sure fire way to start the pain.

It sucks because I get motivated to exercise and every time without fail I injure something. I try going slow and soft but it's just inevitable that my joints will hurt. I used to be very flexible but not anymore and I can't bend my finger back much at all for fear of hurting my hand and wrist, so I'm unsure about hyperflexibility. 

So is this all because of my sedentary lifestyle or could there be something contributing to this? And how am I meant to get fit with such sensitive joints?",1,1734435011.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.  
  
What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:  
  
Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.  
  
3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.  
  
4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.  
  
5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.  
  
As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.  
  
If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv](https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv)  
  
I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.

\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.  
  
3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.  
  
4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.  
  
5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.  
  
As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.  
  
If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv](https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv)  
  
I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.  
  
No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a free 30 mins presentation from my account of their possibilities and my honest B1.2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",0,1734434863.0,EnglishLearning,0,0.5,False
1hg8lta,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hg8lta/can_foot_pads_improve_sleep_energy_levels_or/,"Can Foot Pads Improve Sleep, Energy Levels, or General Well-Being?","If you’ve been exploring wellness trends, you’ve probably come across detox foot patches like **Nuubu foot patch**. These patches claim to detoxify your body, improve sleep, and boost energy levels. But can they actually deliver on these promises? As someone who decided to test **Nuubu detox foot patch**, I’ll share my experience and some insights I’ve gathered.

**What Are Nuubu Foot Patches Supposed to Do?**  
The idea behind **Nuubu footpads** is rooted in traditional Asian medicine, which views the feet as a key area for detoxification. The soles are believed to contain reflexology points connected to various organs. By placing these patches on your feet, the natural herbs and ingredients supposedly help draw out toxins, improve circulation, and promote overall well-being.

**My First Impressions**  
I was curious but also skeptical. Could a simple patch applied to my feet overnight really make a noticeable difference? The first time I used **Nuubu detox foot patch**, I followed the instructions closely: I placed one patch on each foot before bedtime and went to sleep.

The next morning, the patches were dark and sticky, which was a bit surprising. I felt a little more refreshed than usual, but I wasn’t sure if it was just a coincidence. Still, I decided to keep using them to see if the effects would add up.

**Did It Improve My Sleep?**  
After about three nights of using **Nuubu foot patch**, I started noticing deeper sleep patterns. I wasn’t waking up as often during the night, and I felt more rested in the mornings. I can’t say for sure if it was entirely due to the patches, but the change was noticeable enough to make me stick with them.

**Energy Levels and General Well-Being**  
By the end of the first week, I began feeling more energized during the day. Typically, I rely on an afternoon coffee to get through work, but I found myself skipping it without even realizing. It wasn’t just physical energy either—my focus seemed sharper, and I felt more positive overall.

**Are These Changes Real?**  
The science behind detox foot patches is a bit murky. Critics argue that the liver and kidneys already handle detoxification and that external methods like these might not be necessary. However, advocates of **Nuubu detox foot patch** point to the ingredients, such as bamboo vinegar and loquat leaf, which are believed to have detoxifying and anti-inflammatory properties.

**The Psychological Factor**  
Even if the patches don’t fully detoxify the body, the routine itself can be calming. Taking time to care for your body, especially at the end of a stressful day, has its own benefits. Whether it’s placebo or an actual physical effect, I found the process of using **Nuubu footpads** to be worthwhile.

**Final Thoughts**  
Can foot pads like **Nuubu detox foot patch** improve sleep, energy levels, or general well-being? Based on my experience, I’d say yes, but with some caveats. The results might vary from person to person, and while the science isn’t definitive, the benefits I noticed were enough to keep me using them.

1hg8l1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedBullRacing/comments/1hg8l1f/is_orbr_the_paddock_the_best_formula_1_loyalty/,Is ORBR ‘The Paddock’ the best Formula 1 loyalty scheme?,"TLDR: Yes!

Oracle Red Bull Racing Formula 1 team have a loyalty scheme called ‘The Paddock’ and here’s how my VIP loyalty status was exceptionally rewarded.

Members of ‘The Paddock’ were invited to enter a competition to attend (with a guest) a year end live recording of the podcast ‘Talking Bull’ at ‘MK7’ (Featuring Christian Horner and Max Verstappen, hosted by Nicola Hume). 

Five winners were selected and I wasn’t one :(. 

However, I am a member of the ‘The Paddock’ VIP tier discord channel. Last Tuesday, I checked the channel and saw that the ‘The Paddock’ said they have a spare ticket for the event the following day and the first person to respond wins. I won! :). 

Wait, how am I going to get there? I live in North London so a quick search showed that it’s only an hour drive to Milton Keynes where the ORBR F1 team is based. Panic over.

Next quandary is who can I take the following day and who would be available? As time was of the essence (a name had to be given for security purposes), I decided to take my retired mother who has never been to anything Formula 1 related  (It was her birthday the prior week) .

Wednesday arrived and before you know it, we was enjoying barista style coffee in front of a Formula 1 car (An eco-friendly initiative across the campus is to bring a re-usabale cup which is a good measure). We were also each given an ORBR ‘The Paddock’ cap - nice touch.

I could see that there was a lot of activity and buzz around the whole building/campus as it was the team’s celebration photo day.

We was then introduced to a very knowledgeable guide (Juan, who kindly answered my numerous questions), who escorted us to the famous reception that houses all of the trophies (more on this later).

We then had a factory tour of the following areas (manufacturing, paintshop, electronics, the two giant autoclaves and assembly workshop). We both was super impressed by the scale of the operation and the insights given (I have also been to the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 campus and McLaren Technology Centre. The ORBR Factory Tour is far superior!). Factory tours (also inclusive of heritage bays, operations room, model shop, race bays) can be purchased, as well as screening events and others at https://experiences.redbullracing.com.

After having lunch in the canteen we then headed back to the ‘MK7’ building for the podcast. With our welcome drink in hand (My mother went for a glass of Champagne :) ), we then viewed the fifteen formula 1 cars on display before heading up to the mezzanine level. The floor area was filled with 100 or so employees who have achieved 20 years of service with ORBR (Chapeau to them). 

This was where the day became even more epic! 4 time World Champion Max Verstappen only came to see us!!!! We had a quick chat and of course photos were taken :) I felt very privileged as a loyal member of The Paddock. Max was friendly and approachable, bearing in mind the amount of posing for photo’s etc. on that special team day.

Then the very interesting ‘Talking Bull’ live podcast started. Watch out for ORBR’s socials when this comes out. 

The day ended when the podcast recording finished…but not just yet. 

I wanted to go back to the world’s best reception (IMO) full of trophies to take some pics without people. It was even more spectacular at night as you can see from the pics. I then saw Christian Horner exiting the building so I managed to get a quick selfie to complete the day (thanks Christian :) ). 

To conclude, ORBR ‘The Paddock’ is the BEST Formula 1 loyalty scheme and Max/ORBR/F1 has my retired mother as a new fan. She even asked when is the next race? I replied that it’s Christmas, and the season has ended :). It just goes to show that Formula 1 has the ability to attract fans of all ages.

Special thanks to Brad, Elliot, Juan, Max, Christian and the whole ORBR F1 team!

I have provided some choice snaps from permitted areas (See next Pics post).

I certainly have. Over the past few days in fact. There is nothing fun about being a single parent and struggling to live on a cheap wage and make all the right decisions along the way regarding your child's future, and your own. It can be overwhelming. Faith and trust are essential at the best of times, but they are especially critical when life threatens to overflow and you feel powerless and afraid. This week, I put together a list of the top ten promises of God to remind ourselves that we are not in this alone, and to bring comfort, assurance and some peace of mind when the storms and battles of life make us feel like we're losing the fight. It's a good idea to go over these promises in the morning perhaps, while you're having coffee, and keep them nearby to read and digest. 

They can serve as a solid foundation, reminding us that we are not alone in our struggles and that God’s faithfulness endures through every season, including the one you're in right now. 

# Promises of God to Reflect On

1. **God’s Presence and Guidance** *“The Lord will guide you continually, giving you water when you are dry and restoring your strength. You will be like a well-watered garden, like an ever-flowing spring.”* —Isaiah 58:11 **Promise**: God will guide you, sustain you, and restore your strength in times of weariness.
2. **God’s Provision** *“And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.”* —Philippians 4:19 **Promise**: God will provide for your needs—physical, emotional, and spiritual—according to His abundant grace.
3. **God’s Strength in Our Weakness** *“But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.”* —2 Corinthians 12:9 **Promise**: In our weakness, God’s strength is made perfect. You don’t have to do this on your own—He’s with you every step.
4. **God’s Plans for You** *“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.”* —Jeremiah 29:11 **Promise**: God has good plans for your life—plans filled with hope and a future. Even when the path isn’t clear, trust that He is leading you.
5. **God’s Faithfulness** *“If we are faithless, he remains faithful—for he cannot deny himself.”* —2 Timothy 2:13 **Promise**: Even when we doubt or feel unfaithful, God remains faithful to His promises. He won’t abandon you, no matter what.
6. **God’s Peace** *“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.”* —John 14:27 **Promise**: When you are feeling overwhelmed, God’s peace is available to calm your heart and mind.
7. **God’s Rest** *“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”* —Matthew 11:28 **Promise**: God offers you rest and renewal when you are weary. Take time to come to Him for the rest you need.
8. **God’s Unfailing Love** *“For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed,” says the Lord, who has compassion on you.”* —Isaiah 54:10 **Promise**: God’s love for you is unshakable. No circumstance or challenge can remove His love.
9. **God’s Restoration** *“I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten…”* —Joel 2:25 **Promise**: God has the power to restore what was lost, to renew and rebuild what’s been broken.
10. **God’s Victory Over Fear** *“For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.”* —2 Timothy 1:7 **Promise**: God empowers you with His spirit to overcome fear and walk in confidence, love, and control.",1,1734434542.0,FrontlinesNetwork,0,1.0,False

1hg8icz,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1hg8icz/a_beginners_guide_to_specialty_coffee/,A beginner's guide to specialty coffee ,"Hello r/IndiaCoffee. I have seen a lot of posts on this subreddit where people are disappointed by their forays into specialty coffee, whether it's in cafes like Blue Tokai or on their own. So, I thought I will share some thoughts on how to avoid some traps when venturing out of your comfort zone when it comes to coffee.

* What do I mean by specialty coffee?
   * Specialty coffee means different things to different people. Here's my take on what it is and what's different about it. ""Specialty Coffee"" is to me defined in opposition to ""generic coffee"", which is coffee you find in supermarkets, mass produced, mass processed to optimize caffeine content and ease of extraction, often at the cost of flavor. Coffee is one of the most complex beverages out there, hundreds of volatile compounds, sugars, acids, bitters etc. When prepared well, all these flavors harmonize to produce a drink that is unforgettable. I can still remember the first good coffee I had almost 10 years ago. It was at a small cafe in Okinawa, Japan. I used to dislike coffee at that time because I had only tasted bitter stuff that was palatable with milk and necessary when I wanted to stay up at night to get stuff done. That coffee though was different, it was fruity, sour, slightly sweet, the bitterness was there, but it was pleasant and complemented perfectly all the other flavors. I have never had a coffee like that again, but now I can prepare something that's 60-70% as good. Coming back, *specialty coffee is coffee that is optimized for its flavor and not for caffeine.* This doesn't mean it has less caffeine. It's about caffeine's ease of extraction. Generic coffee often is roasted so dark that coffee oils are out on the surface, meaning all you need to do is grind however you want and put some hot water, and you will get a good dose of caffeine. It will taste like crap, but you'll get the hit you want. On the contrary, light roasted coffee, which is common in specialty coffee industry is known to be very difficult to extract well. It needs specialized equipment and good amount of experience. Another way to think of specialty coffee is that it is coffee without mass industrialization and commodification. I have friends from Ethiopia who grew up drinking coffee processed and prepared using traditional methods and they consider ""Western coffee"" as sewage water.
* How do I try specialty coffee in India?
   * The good news is that India is one of the fastest growing producers and consumers of specialty coffee. People have realized that coffee is not supposed to taste like crap and now there are increasingly large number of outfits that want to share this experience with others. However, it is hard to get people to forget old habits. Even though some of these companies have made the barrier to entry quite low, there is still room for improvement. Here's my recommendation on how to try specialty coffee in India for yourself. I am going to pick Blue Tokai easy pour sampler packs as a place to start, not because they are good but because they are the most accessible. This is not at all a recommendation for Blue Tokai. Blue Tokai is just one of the roasters focused on specialty coffee out there. Awesome people in this subreddit have already compiled a big list.
* Okay what next?
   * I like to think of coffee as being composed of two opposing forces, the earthy, rich tasting flavors, sometimes referred as ""body"" and the fruity flavors, which are colloquially called ""sweet notes"", although more often than not, sour/acidic notes prevail over the sugars. Although this is an overgeneralization, in my experience people are divided in their preference for these two components. People who like body, tend not to like fruiter coffees, while people who like fruity coffees don't find heavy bodied coffees appealing. I think this is more a sign of the fact that it is extremely hard to prepare a cup that is well balanced in the two. When it is off balance, then people just prefer one or the other instead of an awkward mixture of the two. In any case, if you don't already know what your preference is, how do you figure it out?
* Some handpicked BT easy pour packs highlighting body or fruitiness
   * For fruity coffee I'd say try something like this
      * [Seethargundu Estate | Light Roast - Easy Pour Coffee Sachets](https://bluetokaicoffee.com/collections/easy-pour/products/seethargundu-estate-easy-pour-coffee-sachets)
   * For heavy bodied coffee, try this
      * [Monsoon Malabar | Medium-Dark Roast - Easy Pour Coffee Sachets](https://bluetokaicoffee.com/collections/easy-pour/products/monsoon-malabar-easy-pour-coffee-sachets)
   * If you want to try something that is potentially more balanced, then try these
      * [Thogarihunkal Estate | Medium Roast - Easy Pour Coffee Sachets](https://bluetokaicoffee.com/collections/easy-pour/products/thogarihunkal-estate-easy-pour-coffee-sachets)
      * [Attikan Estate | Medium-Dark Roast - Easy Pour Coffee Sachets](https://bluetokaicoffee.com/collections/easy-pour/products/attikan-estate-easy-pour-coffee-sachets)
* How do I prepare these?
   * As easy as these easy pour bags are, I am not a fan of the instructions. Here is how I recommend preparing them. Perhaps others can also provide their recommendations in the comments.
   * Make first bag with only 150-160 grams of water. Don't add milk. If you find the coffee too sour, then increase the amount of water for the next bag. If you find it too bitter, use even less water for next bag.
   * Don't use boiling water, even though, that's what they say on the bag. Use 90-95 degrees. In case you can't measure temperature accurately, wait 2-3 minutes before pouring. Alternatively transfer in another container before pouring onto coffee to cool the water down.
* What if I still don't like these?
   * As long as you stick to this, you should have a cup you like. If you don't, then maybe you could try easy pour bags from another roaster? If that still doesn't work, perhaps specialty coffee is not your thing after all? Which is probably good news because you don't have to spend a shit ton to get your caffeine fix, you lucky bastard.
* Okay this is great, I think I get a sense of what I like, where do I go after this?
   * I am sure people of r/IndiaCoffee will have tons of good recommendations. If you are in a big city, I'd say try a local roaster. Try coffees from different estates and even different countries. Don't try expensive stuff like Geisha etc. You gotta train and develop your palette first before trying the expensive shit. Otherwise, chances of you being disappointed are quite high. Same goes for espresso. Don't try to do specialty espresso, that's insanely hard and frustrating. Stick to simple stuff, pour overs, aeropress or even South Indian filter. They can all make incredible cups reliably once dialed in correctly. Finally, once you've decided you want to take the next steps of doing this yourself instead of easy pours, get a good grinder. Not cheap but it's the one thing that changes everything. A 100 Rs South Indian filter paired with an excellent grinder will produce better cups than a basic grinder paired an expensive machine. So if you want to save money, save it on the machine and not on the grinder. A cup of coffee just needs hot water and coffee grounds. Hot water is easy to get so if you can control the coffee grounds, you can control the quality of the beverage.
* One controversial opinion
   * It's really hard to find good coffees in a cafe, at least during peak hours. Cafes are optimizing for speed of service and not flavor. Almost always I have made a better cup at home with the same beans. In most places, baristas are hired not for their skill but for their willingness to work long hours for less money. Of course, not all cafes are like this. There are genuinely good cafes in India where people who are truly passionate and knowledge about coffee prepare great cups for their customers. But those are few and far between just because there are no incentives and businesses care more about staying afloat and turning a profit instead of giving you a good cup of coffee.",16,1734434386.0,IndiaCoffee,3,0.94,False

He was then very aggressive and argumentative about it all when we spoke initially.. said I wasn't to speak to her without him present (when I suggested her and I meeting over a coffee)...then said he'd tee ot up next time she was around (and he didn't), then he messaged to arrange a catch up and didn't reply until the night before so I'd made other plans...and now I've agreed to meet her on the weekend... hoping it happens and it's just done 


How do I approach this? 
I feel like there's so many things I want to say to her but there is no point in any of it. He's involved her, it won't he undone. He's probably told her I'm horrible. I think the whole situation is wrong and gross. I think it's all about what suits him. And I think he will eventually be horrible to her as he was to me..

So do I just say, 

Hi, it's nice to meet you. I'm glad we could be introduced given you're spending so much time with my kids. 
Do I add something like... I don't think it was the right thing for John to do keep ot from me that he'd introduced you to the kids and had you staying over with them.. as we had previously agreed to, and I do wonder how long you'd been seeing each  other before involving the kids...but I appreciate the opportunity to at least meet... seems pointless... and will just make me sound bad... 

(I hate small talk) 🤷🏻‍♀️
So any tips are appreciated...",1,1734434180.0,Divorce,0,0.6,False

Bad breath, or halitosis, can be a real social hurdle. It can knock your confidence and leave you feeling self-conscious. One potential culprit? A pesky dental infection. If you've recently undergone a root canal, you might be wondering, will bad breath go away after root canal treatment? This is a common question, and the answer, thankfully, is usually yes! But there are nuances to understand. This article dives deep into the connection between root canals, bad breath, and the path to fresher smiles. We'll explore the causes of bad breath, the role of root canals, post-treatment care, and when you should seek professional help. So, buckle up, and let's breathe easy together!

Will Bad Breath Go Away After Root Canal? The Lowdown
-----------------------------------------------------

We often think of root canals as a last resort for severely damaged teeth. But they're actually a saving grace – a way to preserve your natural tooth and prevent extraction. So, what's the connection between root canals and bad breath? Well, the bad breath isn’t directly caused *by* the root canal procedure itself. It's usually a symptom of the infection that *necessitated* the root canal in the first place. This infection can fester deep within the tooth, harboring bacteria that produce foul-smelling sulfur compounds.

### Unveiling the Causes of Bad Breath and the Root Canal Connection

Think of your infected tooth like a tiny, hidden swamp. It's a breeding ground for bacteria, feeding on decaying tissue and releasing those nasty sulfur compounds that cause bad breath. A root canal essentially drains this swamp, cleans it out, and seals it up. So, logically, once the source of the infection is eliminated, the bad breath should follow suit, right? In most cases, absolutely! However, a few factors can complicate things.

1. **Lingering Infection:** Sometimes, despite the best efforts, a small amount of infection can remain. This can be due to complex canal anatomy or missed canals. Think of it like trying to clean a convoluted cave system – some nooks and crannies can be hard to reach.
2. **Leaking Temporary Fillings:** After a root canal, your tooth is typically sealed with a temporary filling. If this filling leaks, bacteria can sneak back in and restart the infection cycle, leading to persistent bad breath. It's like patching a hole in a boat with duct tape – it might hold for a while, but it's not a permanent solution.
3. **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Even with a successful root canal, neglecting your oral hygiene can lead to bad breath. Bacteria thrive on plaque and food particles, so brushing and flossing are essential for keeping your mouth fresh. Imagine cleaning your house meticulously, and then letting dirty dishes pile up in the sink – you’re basically inviting the bacteria back in!

Will Bad Breath Go Away After Root Canal? Factors Affecting Freshness
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's dive deeper into what impacts your breath after a root canal. It’s not a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, there’s more to the story. Several factors play a crucial role in determining how quickly your breath freshens up post-treatment.

### Healing Time – Patience is Key

After a root canal, your body needs time to heal. This isn't an overnight process. The inflammation and any residual infection need to subside, which can take several days or even a couple of weeks. Much like a sprained ankle needs time to recover, your tooth needs time to bounce back too.

### The Importance of Post-Treatment Care – Your Role in Fresh Breath Success

Following your dentist's post-treatment instructions is crucial for a smooth recovery and fresh breath. This usually involves:

- **Taking Prescribed Medications:** Antibiotics are often prescribed to combat any remaining infection. Take them as directed, even if you start feeling better. Think of it like a course of treatment – quitting halfway might not kill off all the bad guys.
- **Maintaining Excellent Oral Hygiene:** Brushing and flossing gently around the treated area is vital. However, be careful not to disturb the temporary filling. It's a delicate balance between cleanliness and caution!
- **Rinsing with Antiseptic Mouthwash:** This helps kill bacteria and keep your mouth clean. It’s like giving your mouth a refreshing shower that washes away those lingering odor-causing villains.

### The Crown – The Final Seal of Freshness

Once your tooth has healed, a permanent crown is usually placed. This is the final step in restoring your tooth’s structure and function. It also creates a tight seal, preventing bacteria from re-entering the treated tooth. Think of it as the fortress wall, keeping the enemies (bacteria) at bay.

Will Bad Breath Go Away After Root Canal? When to Seek Professional Help
------------------------------------------------------------------------

While bad breath usually improves after a root canal, there are times when you should seek professional help.

### Persistent Bad Breath – More Than Just a Lingering Odor

If your bad breath persists for more than a couple of weeks after the root canal, it's time to see your dentist. This could indicate a lingering infection, a leaky temporary filling, or another underlying issue. Don’t let it fester – a stitch in time saves nine!

### Pain or Swelling – Signs of Trouble Brewing

Pain or swelling around the treated tooth can also signal a problem. This could be a sign of inflammation, infection, or even a nerve issue. Ignoring these symptoms is like ignoring a flashing warning light on your car's dashboard – it’s not a good idea!

### Unusual Taste – A Clue to Underlying Issues

A persistent unusual or metallic taste in your mouth can also be a red flag. This could indicate a leaking temporary filling or a developing infection. It's your body’s way of saying ""Hey, something's not right in here!""

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Beyond the Root Canal: Other Causes of Bad Breath
-------------------------------------------------

It's important to remember that a root canal isn't the only possible cause of bad breath. Other common culprits include:

- **Dry Mouth:** Saliva plays a crucial role in washing away bacteria and food particles. Reduced saliva production can lead to a buildup of bacteria and bad breath. Imagine a garden without water; it quickly becomes dry and susceptible to pests!
- **Gum Disease:** Gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, is an infection of the gums that can cause bad breath. Think of it as the foundation of a house crumbling – it needs to be addressed to prevent further damage.
- **Certain Foods and Drinks:** Foods like garlic and onions and beverages like coffee can contribute to bad breath. These foods contain sulfur compounds that can linger on your breath long after you've eaten them.
- **Tobacco Use:** Smoking and chewing tobacco can cause bad breath, stain teeth, and increase your risk of gum disease. It's a triple whammy of oral health hazards!
- **Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and kidney disease, can also contribute to bad breath.

Conclusion
----------

So, will bad breath go away after root canal? In most cases, the answer is a resounding yes! A root canal eliminates the source of infection, paving the way for fresher breath. However, proper post-treatment care and patience are key to a successful outcome. If you experience persistent bad breath, pain, swelling, or an unusual taste, don't hesitate to contact your dentist. They can diagnose the problem and provide the appropriate treatment. Remember, a healthy mouth is a happy mouth – and a happy mouth leads to confident smiles and fresher breath!",1,1734433260.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False

My life is currently not stable to say the least. My work is not fulfilling, my own company is slacking, my own housing situation is far from ideal and my dating life is hard. So a lot is going on. And I have always a little winter depression. 

But I do sports everyday, I do walk everyday, and try to eat healthy. 

Last week I suddenly had the feeling i overreacted to coffee if I talk about hartrate was racing. (I also took red ginseng like every day). I only drink 1 espresso a day, incidental 2. 

So I stopped cold turkey last Friday and also stopped with the ginseng. Because of the heart rate. 

But now I am 4 days in , with stopping. And it feels like my mood and sleep is way terrible right now. Then last week. I feel more anxious. I cry sometimes out of nothing. And have no motivation for nothing. 

Is this possible due to the caffeine stop?

My problem is, I don’t know what to do right now. I want to get my life on track. I also excercise daily. But right now life feels extra hard. Is it wise to just take the coffee and try stopping when my life is back on track?

This happened recently. I’m 25(F) My younger brother 22(M) had a fairly bad breakup with his gf a couple of years ago. They are cordial if they meet at events, but other than that, he wants nothing to do with her. I’ve never had any problems with my brother’s girlfriends before but this one was a different level of toxic. We got along really well (or so I thought). I even supported her small business by buying stuff and getting my friends to do the same. 

This feeling was somehow never reciprocated. She tried creating rifts between me and my brother at times, I have absolutely no idea why. He used to ice me out, not talk for days (yes, very immature at times) But he grew up and eventually realized on his own that I was never the problem. Sorry for the rant but I thought I’d give some context. 

My mother knows ALL this. She knows the unnecessary drama his ex created. She is, for some reason, still in touch with her. They even meet for coffee once in a while. I will never understand this dynamic but it’s her life and she says she can meet whoever she wants. Fair enough. 

Recently, out of the blue, she posted a photo of his ex on her Instagram story. Just a picture of her with a caption saying how beautiful she looked. Yes, VERY random. I was confused as hell. I’m sure the ex was just as confused lol. I immediately confronted her and her reason was “I just felt like it”

I was LIVID. The protective sister in me instantly woke up and I asked her why she thought it was okay to disrespect her son like that. She knows my brother doesnot like talking about his ex. She knows the history and was still absolutely okay with doing this. My brother saw it too and asked me if mom was on drugs🤣

In retrospect, yes it’s a very silly thing to fight over, but what the hell was she even thinking?? She is mad at me and accused me of overreacting. I don’t feel bad for the things I said but did I overreact? AITA? ",2,1734432479.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

In July he said some horrible things to me, because, he claimed I was infatuated (I wasn't.. I considered him a good friend, that was all, and I was going through a hard time when I really needed a good friend but i had no one, but apparently some coworkers started rumors that he believed).  Among other things calling me sad, depressing, childish, petty, he told me he only pretended to be my friend to lift my spirits, told me I spiraled over nothing (my dad was on hospice and died.. I wouldn't call it nothing but ok), cursed me... among other things. but then we had a almost normal conversation the next day and I thought we were ok and maybe when he said the awful things he was just.. having a rough day maybe?  In August I woke up finding he blocked me on the chat platform we used.  I texted him and said a few regrettable things, and he didn't even recognize my number at first.  meaning he completely cut me off without a reason, an explanation or even a goodbye.  For months I've been trying to come to terms with it.  I texted him to apologize but i assume he blocked me because he never responded.  my mom says it wasn't my fault.  my therapist says it wasn't my fault.  coworkers say it wasn't my fault.  everyone tries to tell me it wasn't my fault.  But... I guess it's just a glitch in my mind that refuses to believe that.  Maybe it's part of being autistic?  is that why I always need to understand and why I can't accept things without reason or proof?  I'm still trying to understand.  After all, he still has family, and friends, and people who love him.  I'm the one who's all alone.. who everyone ghosts and nobody wants to know.  

  
Yesterday I couldn't sleep.  So I finally got up and went into work for a few hours on a shift that was not my normal time frame.  I honestly didn't even know he still worked there.  i got moved to a different department to help out and as I walked over I glanced at the staffing board to see his name at a station.   I was leaving work early anyway because I hate being staffed in this particular department, and.. it was like I just.. couldn't help it.  I had to see him... i had to try to apologize one last time.  for whatever I did wrong to make him hate me so much.  I don't know what I did but I thought..  I mean it's been almost 4 months.. maybe we could talk like adults. or maybe I could at least apologize?  So I went to his station and I said ""hey""... and he turned around quick and went ""YES!"" and at first he didn't recognize me.. but as soon as he did he started looking around wildly, maybe looking for a supervisor or someone?  Then he just.. turned his back to me without a word.  I told him ""look... i just want to apologize for everything, ok? so.. I'm sorry, for everything."" my words just kind of got stuck when he turned his back to me and my mind suddenly blanked.. and, I wanted to say so much more... but when I realized he wasn't even going to acknowledge me  I just said ""ok then.. you take care of yourself sir..."" and walked away.  I know if I hadn't at least tried I would regret it.  But... at the same time.. of all the things I would have expected, I mean I had hoped for him to say ""it's not your fault but you need to leave me alone"" or ""it's ok dude, but we can't be friends anymore"" or ""I can't forgive you, leave me alone you crazy b\*\*\*\*"" just.. something.  and I'd expected anger, yelling, telling me to go away.. giving me the finger, somehow just.. not even being acknowledged hurt so much worse than anything else ever could have.  he looked through me and then turned his back on me like I wasn't even there.  I've been crying almost non stop since.  i don't even know what I did wrong.  It feels like if i have a soul.. it just took another hard beating.  and i don't know how much more I can take. I know he's well within his rights, he didn't have to talk to me.  or acknowledge me.  it just seems so odd that someone can mean so much to me that I'd do anything for them...  To give you an idea of how much his friendship meant, I gave this guy my dads playstation 5 last year for christmas.. I bought our coffee every time we went out... he meant a LOT to me... while simultaneously I don't mean anything to him.  and it hurts so bad... back when we were friends.. he was there for me when no one else was, and I thought I was there for him too.

My biggest reason for not having more friends that I can actually see and go have a coffee with to unwind or whatever is because 1: I'm absolutely socially awkward and run out of things to say really fast because I tend to over share and get hurt in the process, and 2: my husband (42 M) keeps saying that ""we don't need anyone else, we have each other"", which implies to me I'm not allowed to make friends unless he does the introduction.

My husband tells little lies a lot. And I'm really good at spotting them. I wouldn't say I usually care about what he's lying about, but I do care that he clearly thinks he can lie about small stuff all the time. it's really inconsequential stuff. Sometimes I do call him out. Most often I don't. I'll give some examples:


He will lie about the time he leaves work. Or how long the journey took. I know why - it's because after work he likes to sit in his van and reply to messages or call his Mom, or stop for coffee and food along the way.


Like, I have never made an issue about this so I don't know why he lies. Some days I might call to make sure he's okay if he's taking a long time,  (because he has fallen asleep at the wheel before) and I often make dinner ready for his arrival so it affects that, for example. The only reason I figured this stuff out is because he does it everywhere he goes.


Recently he visited his Mom and she messaged me when he left to say she had sent some goodies over for our kid and ""he's just left with them."" His Mom lives 40 minutes drive from us. But, 20 minutes after she had sent me that message, he sent me one to say he was just leaving. He arrived home 40 minutes later.


He does other stuff like say I've asked him to clean up the yard whilst I'm running errands, and I'm gone for say an hour, he will maybe start cleaning the yard like 50 minutes after I've left. It's not like I care when he does it, but if we have agreed to get two tasks done simultaneously,  and he doesn't start for ages, its frustrating It can affect what happens next like if we have someplace to be - but it's the fact that in this situation he'd lie and say ""it took me ages to find the garbage bags"" or whatever, when really he didn't start for ages because he was just laying around.


Other things like if I ask him to come help me with dinner, he's on his phone and claims he will help after sending a few work emails - 20 minutes later I'll walk over and remind him I need help, only to see he's chatting to his friend (not a co-worker) or browsing social media. He does not use social media for his job. Who cares if he's chatting to his friend, but then I'll say ""oh so you're done and can help me?"" and then he will say ""I've got one more email to send"" and it's really hard for me to just leave it alone?
 

I stopped asking him to run errands because of this. If I asked him to drive to the supermarket (5 mins drive away) and get some butter, this would take only 25 minutes max even if it was busy. He'd be gone for double that time. And then eventually I'd call (only if I needed the item in a timely manner) and he'd make some excuses about the roads being busy/supermarket busy/he had to deal with a work thing. 


A few times I sent our kid with him and they were back faster than whenever he went alone.


I have gotten to the point where it's just starting to really irritate me. Sometimes I feel gaslit, or suspicious, and I have a hard time trusting him fully.

When these quiet, lonely times of night occur, when no ""accidentally"" interrupting form of ""better than us?"" questions are not asked by inserted into my life by force, I write.  I write as it was the armor of my life, the sword in my little girl armed right hand and the shield in my little girl armed left hand.

""Elite warriors"" come in these packages that confound movie goers, even those who know others like them. How could I be one of them? A question you and I both ask, because the voices in my head scream those questions loudest.

I redacted two names, my totally obvious one, the name of a girl who should be obvious to anyone who knows me.

Everything else remains the submission that likely only 3,002 others will read. 3,000 here, 2 there. Another one of my pointless writings I don't even really intend to have put up. I love my armor, because in words there are few better armed out there to be found and counted.  I write because each word is my lover, my Jamie Whisper Kisser, my Alexis Porcelain-Moonlit-Pallid, my Carrie-Anne Dear Jersey Girl, my Redacted and Unrequited Lover, and, too, my other sad eyed junkie girls.

Gentlemen,

A dream just reawakened me. A portion of it, you, replying to a comment about baseball to this phone I write on now as ""South Park"" is the background noise the autistic writer needs, the PTSD-addled sleeper's mind requires. A different portion of it, enough to reawaken me, too much to be at all desirous of allowing it to perhaps return. 

It runs very long, because it's Bitchtits, the notorious (-ly handsome) bank robber writing, but I feel it's worth the contemplation, consideration, and perhaps -but probably not- the condensation and the internet-based publication of two website running men who saved me from bad dreams and places with big packages of paper from the COs I won over to me, if not to the messages I offered, though in private, many would say things that their red state peers would never approve of and that their red state jobs depended on them never sharing.  

It overshares, it twists and turns the language used to twist logic, too, to two opposing viewpoints that have no basis in anything like the reality we have but seem so clear in the reality we wish we had.

As usual, thank you for the saving of me from dreams and places, your eye's passage over my odd duck words who lies awake, his Ex-Con motif completing motorcycle arriving in the morning, not at all the bad news meth machine that girls who hate their fathers hope for when they choose to take the offer of some guy who robbed a bank to go to dinner, my ""yes, ma'am""s to mothers and ""yes, sir""s to fathers as disappointing to the girls as the held doors and chairs are to those who whisper of us at the restaurant we go to, those small town whispers reaching soon adoring mothers and fathers who suddenly understand PTSD and heroin, assault rifles and locks of hair and kisses for good luck.

I awoke, though so to the news, of course, post-1994 edition, a Republican revolution that convinced poor people to blame poor people for their poverty, thank the rich for showing them the shades of brown between the black and white world of upvotes and downvotes that are our only choices now. You are for us or against us, as a united nation cheers the murder of a murdered murderer.  I, among them, long before them each, the mule that was pulling the bandwagons and canalboats of revolutionary actions and opions they now all leap aboard, just as I towed along that long and slow path, up the incremental locks and the long and leaky levels between each one in the curving and leaking slow walked canal tow path to marriage and service equality, glad they are now so suddenly aboard, skeptical of thier commitments, embittered by thier sudden ""thank you for your service"" to another soldier in this post-sidewalk-9/11 world of one CEO just as they offered it to me, and their seats, too, in my post-9/11 world, and never too much before.  

Tonight there is, quite predictably, much ado aboard the internet about the UK banning puberty blockers for people under 18 and I find myself incredibly conflicted on this issue.  Some mutations were required, because I found too many hands to consider.  As it is the case that when one's boobs are too small in volume, one gets a boob job, I consider the operation required to consider this delicate issue my latest hand job.

Large (or ""above average, as the girls' kind obfuscations go) portions of me lie herein, as vapid Americans, attention-seeking whores and whiners, each in thier own and not-at-all uniquely uniquely American way, complete the picture with their desperate dances of life's performance arts, a dance with steps both to some imagined and implied into an issue, two steps left and two steps right.

On some hands, I cannot imagine making a life altering choice before my brain had fully developed...says the guy who signed on to kill or die at 17. This guy, the never-archetypal real man, hard man, he signed on in a country where he could neither vote for the people sending him to die nor drink to forget that his friend's sister got her ears pierced at 6, her belly button by 8, and her nipples at 12 and that he couldn't get a tribal or barbed wire tattoo to memorialize each of those events.

On another set of hands, he signed on In a nation where to allow strange men to discipline your teenage daughter on a nude portion of her private, delicate form is legal and encouraged by law and where a parent might force death upon their child directly by claiming a religious exemption to an appendectomy and genitally mutilate their son but only physically alter their daughter around her ears, belly button, and nipples.  He signed on in a nation where his foster brother was deemed to be at risk of being subjected to abusive behavior but he wasn't because his parents believed in some book whole bunches really truly deeply so anything done to that child was A-OK, the good, Christian parenting that his nation's laws and people encourage to toughen up that autistic child who won't be easy or behave as their book desires and who cries too much, an unruly, sad child who needs to have something real to cry about, to understand sadness because his wasn't real, he just wanted attention...but not from the congregation, a sin.

Still more hands measure that he signed on in a nation where 16 is too young to drive, 17 is old enough to kill or die for others but too young to vote or drink, and 18 was old enough to some of those things, and buy an assault rifle and ten-thirty round magazines to express his masculinity but still not old enough to drink himself into a stupor about marrying a girl he never really loved and his life not being what high school football super-stardom promised it would always be for him.  By 21 he could do that all of stuff but not rent a car.

Even more hands hold his children being forced to act on the internet in his stupid channel's paternal attention-seeking behavior for no compensation, as his one daughter is his hated wife's -her mother's- best hope for attention on the beauty pageant circuit, and as his oldest son plays Pop Warner football where he gets concussed by age 8, ALS by 30.

Several other hands exist to consider that people always thought he was in transition after the knowledge of transgenderism became common, that his writing is often confused for the words of a female, and that as he was regularly accused of not being what a good and American boy should be he chose to pursue manly things and would never have been allowed to block his puberty had he wanted to because his performance artist parents were dancing for the world a happy and Christian family dance and to even have suggested such a thing would have required firm and loving, good Christian correction of their effete and unwanted addition, a fact which would never surprise his fellow inmates when they wondered why that bank robbing, writer guy laid on the ground in the yard appeared feminine in pose and prose and motion, why his walk was gentler, lighter, more deliberate, his pinky finger extended over coffee in the dayroom, his braggadocios about the beautiful women he married and made love to, the beautiful girls he turned down for the sake of doing  right, anymore than it would any of the guys who would buy a Marine veteran with a 14 outta 10 hot wife a drink in a gay bar on karaoke nights, perhaps seeing something in a confusing and confused person who doesn't see that thing all the time because to do that would require firm and loving correction of the good and Christian heroin addiction he nursed because of the things of his childhood that caused such confusion and self hatred that he signed his life away in a nation of parents who make terrible choices for their own ego's sake with no thought of the child or the consequences.

This issue bedevils me on the fourteen hands I have.  Had I had good parents, or just a single father with a touch more emotional maturity, I wonder how different my world at 0134 hours after a PTSD dream reawakened me would be.  I wonder had there been puberty blockers when I was young would I have wanted them and would I have been mature enough in maybe just that one regard to know something that others see all the time and others see never and I see somewhere between those two.  I wonder from the confused position of adult clarity on such things into the position of the not-at-all confused and simple honesty of the world of not-harmed-too-much-yet-to-learn-to-lie children.

I wonder since parents are involved in these choices is there any way that there aren't people pressuring children for it as a path to their own upvotes from others just as assuredly as there are parents denying them to children for the upvotes of their congregations.  Of course there are. We know this because we each know people. I watch them, didn't watch them for the perfect 5 year prison coma to see most for who they truly were: as I assumed but hoped not, pathetic, weak, selfish.  The only ones who weren't, those who stayed good through my coma, a nickel I'd never put in a subway turnstile, kept safely for good luck in my pocket with the memories of a lock of hair beneath my Marine Corps cover, a kiss upon my right cheek to go with it.

I wonder if we have determined that these things are all true, when in the name of G-d is someone going to take the time to stop and ask a child playing with his My Little Pony under the scornful eyes of his ""Christian"" mother or at least think of one who could sign away his life at 17 but not be executed as a murderer until 365 days later, the day he could buy an assault rifle and shoot his mother and her precious congregation of grown men who discipline teen girls on nude portions of their bodies for her good...and everyone seems okay with all of these contradictory hands I got that hand job for but this one odd piece is worth all of this attention as though we really put any kind of thought into it worthy of that term and what it implies.

I feel for a child in 1982 who just wanted to play with his ponies one day, his tonkas and model trains the next but who couldn't find something other than judgment of some sort in either and who would have been denied puberty blockers had he sought them as much as the child now who wants to be nothing but a stereotypical boy but has parents who need their 15 minutes of maybe 16 stranger's upvotes so they force puberty blockers into him, set up a channel to chronical their transition to parents of the girl they don't want either.

Even on our side, we refuse to reflect on these contradictory hands I filled with contradictory data.  Even on our side we take the puberty blockers that allow for the denial of the developmental maturing of our minds and thoughts to allow for true, real, pragmatic thought on the world we are in and not the myopia of the world we wish we were in where only ""good Christians"" are the ones doing life-altering things to children for their own reasons and where most people even care about anyone other than themselves, convinced as we are that everyone should care about politics with as many deep concerns as we do.  They should, says the 4 year old boy whose mother's scornful look and hard wooden spoon ssw him through those twisting paths it took to dream of heroin and a hybid heartbeat's tick tick ticking sudden stopping an addiction foist upon her, too, for not being a good and American girl of the southern portion of our shallow, shallow nation of attention-seeking parents, my ever-present Shannon, the second feminine ghost to haunt me with her eyes, though dilated hers, unmoving, unseeing, always and forever-more accusing.

These simple solutions to these complex problems we always seek never take into account that we no longer live in a place where people have to send thier six year old child down the breaker each morning simply to eat, whether he wanted to play a game of American baseball where they created the designated hitter position in his league just for him because a baseball thrown at him looked too much like a punch about to land and he flinched at first base but he couldn't play behind the plate as catcher because his musculature is feminine in form and size and never able to develop anything more than gentle tone, never strengthening more than by age 13 or 14 or he wants to sneak around a steamer trunk in a coal company home's basement and wear his mother's dresses and write stories of strong men and show them, of other subjects and hide them.  There are no hard choices like those anymore to occupy us and consume us so we find these problems and each our soapboxes because our egalitarian inclinations peaked at the supposed equality of the internet public square, where a 12 upvote person's 12 upvotes are equal to any other 12 upvote person's 12 upvotes...and where neither of them are as right as a 14 upvote person because 12<14 and there's no chance that a billionaire activist would program his system to upvote things he agreed with, no chance someone might hold a nuanced view of nuanced things where where both 12 upvote people and the 14 upvote person were all somewhat right and each in their own way upvote-worthy.  

The choice is up or down, and that is what they want of us to divide us between those who hate that my accusing words reflect their attention-seeking parenting and those naive enough to think those words of mine don't, too, point fingers at them for their own hypocrisies, a thought they never even considered possible, any more possible than a boy befriending a beautiful girl just because of her voice, a downvoted effort to seek out the sad storybooking of her eyes I know as my own, because she is my step-sister of the very same mother.  Her name is Longing, Unrequited, a beautiful girl I should have met 9 years ago, all things considered.  Too, this thing that never was with her, a thought they considered as little as the thought that the accuser of those other downvoted people who aren't anything like them whatsoever hates his own hypocrisies and his complicity in all of these contradictory forms of data he holds in his hands -that he had to have that hand job to consider- more than he hates any other person's, because his parents upvoted self hatred into his life for him, their attention-of-an-approving-congregation- seeking-behaviors as heinous as any internet-attention-seeker's behaviors.

Is it right or wrong to outlaw these things when we do and don't and will and won't and let them this and don't let them that and when a genital mutilation, sir, is sometimes just a genital mutilation, other times a health concern, still other times a religiously oppressing thing a 17 year old too young to drink but too old to not be allowed to die and kill never asked for before he just wanted to be allowed to play with his little, plastic ponies after hitting three doubles and a home run, the designated hitter because the congregation of men who discipline teenage girls on a portion of their body in the nude for her own good also said to punch him, slap him, beat him for having strong opinions and weak arms, character, and alpha male potential after his abused foster brother was removed for abusive foster parenting and good and Christian parenting for him, these things he himself could choose for a child he could teenage father by 13, too young to die or kill or drink or vote or buy a gun or get a tattoo but genital mutilating hygienically oppressing things are well within his 13 year-old decision making wheelhouse.

Gentlemen, we are far too childish a species, with far-too-tangled, and far-too-complicated webs of lies and contradictory rules spun by nothing more than simple, weak-willed, low self-esteem bearing attention-seeking spiders with each of eight weak-willed, weak-kneed legs on a different social media site's form of not-at-all desperate and attention-seeking confirmation of their bias.

0351, my mission now complete to solve a problem with honesty, reflection, and logic to a nation that always listens to such forms of rhetorically complex calls to a moment's self- reflection of their own complicity and their own hypocrisies, those each held-too-dearly-too as anything but, because ""that's different"" is supposed to sound different to me when it's muttered in my left ear then it does in my right one.  It never does.  It always sounds the same, ""Rule for thee, not for me, Marine Corps idealist, realist, pragmatist. Go away now to your imaginary and sepiatoned PTSD world of fake-to-us complex problems with no up or down simple simplicities to them as the 'adults' in the master bedrooms of life write out in short form that which passes now for witticisms our complex webs of the simple up and down choices those complex problems present to us, the contradictions, obfuscations, and 'that's differents' we sputter, mutter, and always one-side do 'debate' with those like-minded to always, somehow one-side create a real-to-no-one-but-us simple solution, a web of nothing more than common lies that we each weave.""

The better angels of the natures of my hunting, pecking fingers truly meant no offense in the words I wrote this night, for once.  

I just know the pain of simple ""solutions"" when too simply applied to something so seemingly simple as a child's body.  There's nothing simple in life and any addict who doesn't know that is stupid and those who do know it of addiction's grip but refuse to accept that everything else has the potential to be complicated is either dumb as dog shit or a liar.  Probably both, never, ever neither.

My charred and bent big spoon readers, I have done what people asked me, more, far more than most to be a man. I never was very happy as a man, though. I am not transgender. I know that, but I was never happy being a man, always desiring to be the small and sad eyed junkie girl in the arms of the vigilant and watchful safe space veteran, my safe space in ""his"" arms, those arms attached to two hands that never moved a single millimeter all night, not even to scratch ""his"" nose, under ""his"" watchful eyes on the door, protecting me.

I wanted to be that sad eyed junkie girl and will want to be her the next time she's here, too, with her little ones playing with me, as she reads this, knowing these things already, they having been whispered into her small and right ear next to her super, duper, jazz hands havin', tap dance hunter-killer, stuffed wolf snugglin', big spoon ""elite warrior"".

These spots will blow your taste buds away! 😋🍴,"If you're tired of the usual, predictable places like Nahar and Sangam, and want something a bit more unique and special, let me take you through some hidden gems in Ooty that offer an experience like no other!

**Place2Bee** – Tucked away in the hill station of Ooty, this quaint wooden café is an absolute must-visit. It’s a cozy little spot that opens only after 6 PM, giving it a cool, laid-back vibe. The atmosphere is magical, with soft lighting and a chill, foreign café ambiance. And let’s talk about the cheesecake – it’s served with honey and is, hands down, the best I’ve ever had. Seriously, this place will make you feel like you're in another world. It’s perfect for when you need to cheer someone up or take your girlfriend to feel special – a little slice of heaven on earth!

**W'illey Café** – If you’re walking around Commercial Road near Hyderabad Biryani, you’ll stumble upon this hidden gem. The vibe here is super lively, with a constant stream of foreign visitors, and it’s got a cozy library with some fantastic reads. Their Banana Pie and Cheese Grills are crowd favorites and ridiculously affordable. Plus, you can sit and enjoy the beautiful view of Ooty town while sipping on your coffee. It’s the kind of place you’d want to visit every day with a friend – super chill and welcoming.

**Earl’s Secret** – Now, here’s a true Ooty secret that not many people know about! This place is an old British palace that’s been around for over 130 years. It’s so steeped in history, you’ll feel like you’ve stepped back in time. The hotel itself, with its Victorian-era rooms and furniture, is an experience in itself. You’ll be treated like royalty, but be warned – it’s on the pricier side. A perfect spot for a special anniversary treat or to feel like you’re living in the 1800s for a day. The vibe here is so posh, it’s a real treasure for anyone who appreciates history.

The first and third spots are a little off the beaten path, which makes them feel even more like hidden treasures. Trust me, you won’t forget these experiences anytime soon. Ooty’s filled with many hotels and restaurants, but these places? They’ll stay with you long after you’ve left. So, if you’re looking for something memorable, give them a try – you won’t be disappointed!",2,1734432241.0,u_deep_ti1,1,1.0,False

Therefore, I don't really know what to wirte about. I could describe the weather (it's cold and foggy, high humidity, and grey, typical German winter day) or my surroundings (I'm at the library, surrounded by books, I managed to avoid the stupid chair, and even got a desk with an outlet), but I've done that so often; there's not much vocabulary left to practice in regard to those topics. I've also already described everything on my desk - thermal coffee cup, black, love of my life; waterbottle, clear, part of a toxic love-triangle between me, the bottle, and the toilet; my stupid pencil case that makes me laugh every time I look at it; my studying stuff, not worth describing in detail because I'm going to burn it while dancing around the fire as soon as I'm done - so it's tough to come up with something easy but interesting to write about at the moment. Maybe my life will be more interesting in a month - until then, I fear you'll have to endure some more grumpy descriptions of German weather or more or less detailed descriptions of the history books surrounding me.",2,1734431043.0,WriteStreakEN,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone! Here's some great news. China now has a policy allowing foreign tourists from many countries a 240-hour visa-free transit. It's a wonderful opportunity to visit.

**Preparations Before the Trip**

Before you even set foot in Beijing, make sure you have your visa and passport in order. Also, get an esim card or buy a local SIM card at the airport. In China, the apps we usually use don't work. So, download Alipay for payments, WeChat for reserving attractions and chatting with locals, Baidu Maps for navigation, Dianping for checking restaurant info, and a VPN to help you access the internet.

**Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City**

It's crucial to reserve your visit to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City on WeChat in advance. Although some say you can buy tickets at the entrance of the Forbidden City, I didn't take that risk. Wake up really early because there are numerous security checks and a large number of tourists. I reached Tiananmen Station, Exit B at 8 am. Just follow the crowd and walk through several security checks to reach Tiananmen Rostrum. Tiananmen is like the front door of China's historical and political stage. It has witnessed many important national events, similar to how the Place de la Concorde in Paris has seen significant moments in French history.

From Tiananmen Rostrum, enter the Forbidden City. Plan to spend 3 - 4 hours exploring. You'll see amazing places like the Hall of Supreme Harmony, which is like the grandest and tallest throne room you can imagine. The Western Six Palaces were where the emperor's concubines lived. It's a bit like the harem concept in some Middle Eastern historical palaces. The Imperial Garden is a beautiful royal landscape. The Forbidden City is filled with historical tales. For example, there are stories of power struggles and intrigues among the imperial family, much like the power plays in the Tudor dynasty in England. And the countless antiques and artworks are like a time capsule of China's imperial past.

**Jingshan Park**

After exiting the Forbidden City from the Shenwumen, cross the road and enter Jingshan Park. It's a small but wonderful park. It used to be part of the imperial complex. From the top, you can enjoy a panoramic view of the Forbidden City and other landmarks like Beihai Park, the Bell and Drum Towers, and the China Zun. It's like a natural observatory deck over the city's historical and modern architectural constellation. You can stand there and feel as if you are at the center of a time-traveling kaleidoscope, where centuries of history and modern development converge and unfold beneath your feet.

**Dinner at Siji Minfu Roast Duck Restaurant**

After exploring Jingshan, have dinner at the Forbidden City branch of Siji Minfu Roast Duck Restaurant. The roast duck here is delicious. The crispy skin and tender meat are amazing. The traditional Beijing dishes are also very authentic. I was told by my Chinese friend that it's better and cheaper than Quanjude. It's like finding a hidden gem in the world of Beijing cuisine.

**Wudaoying Hutong**

After lunch, take a taxi to Wudaoying Hutong. This hutong is full of unique Chinese charm. In this hutong, you can have a relaxing afternoon tea at Yuangu and buy some traditional Chinese souvenirs. If you're a coffee lover, Fuding Coffee is a great choice and you can enjoy the view of the hutong from the second floor. Pengci'er is a fun place to make traditional Chinese porcelain. And ToSummer offers nice Chinese-flavored perfumes, like tea-scented ones.

**Huaiyangfu and Huaiyang Cuisine**

For dinner, I went to Huaiyangfu. Huaiyang cuisine is one of the major traditional Chinese cuisines. It focuses on highlighting the natural flavors of ingredients. The Flash-oiled Eel is cooked in a special way to bring out its rich taste. The Braised Pork with Mushrooms is tender and full of flavor. The Yangzhou Fried Rice is a classic combination of eggs, rice, and various veggies. It's similar to Italian cuisine in the sense that it pays great attention to the dexterous use of ingredients and the harmony of flavors.

**Evening Drinks at Beixinqiao**

After dinner, take a taxi to the area near Beixinqiao. Aurora Whiskey & Cocktail and Bar Flavour are two really cool bars. Aurora Whiskey & Cocktail has a great selection of drinks and a cozy atmosphere. Bar Flavour is known for its creative cocktails and stylish decor.

**Final Recommendation**

If you have only one day in Beijing, I also highly recommend visiting Mutianyu Great Wall. It's an amazing place to experience China's ancient architecture and natural beauty. And I'd love to hear about your experiences visiting Tiananmen, the Forbidden City, or any other part of Beijing. Let's have a great exchange of travel stories!",1,1734430914.0,travelchina,2,0.67,False
