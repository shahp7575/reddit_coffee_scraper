Is this the correct stop and itinerary on [entur.no](http://entur.no) website? I am not used to booking these online so want to make sure that I am not making a mistake. Am I picking the correct train stops and lines?

Is it correct to assume that the bus from Åndalsnes to Ålesund does not need to be booked right now and I can buy it after spending 1-3 hours in Åndalsnes? 

I am thinking of Premium ticket to get coffee + water which I think is a good deal for 129 kr, right? Thanks for all your advice and help.

Okay so I (23M) have this guy at work, we’ll call him Issac (21M), who I have had a crush on since I started working at my current job in September. We weren’t friends until just recently, and maybe about a month ago we only started hanging out outside of work because of my friend’s co-worker, Marie. The first few times we all hung out together, but then one night we were smoking and it was late, and Marie said she should leave, and Issac said he should too. However, he saw my guitar, and started to play with it. Marie ended up leaving at around 2:50 AM, and Isaac stayed until 4:30 AM. We talked about the usual get-to-know each other topics such as music and family, and I even put his fingers on the strings of my guitar to play chords. I felt the urge to ask him to hang out one-on-one, but then I found out that he had been in a relationship with another man before, but that it was a little traumatizing, so he leans more towards being interested in girls. He has also mentioned that if he were to be in another relationship with the same sex, he would have to be a really pretty guy for him to want to date. The next day, I was hosting at my restaurant job, and he said he liked my fit and then later that same evening told me that I looked *really* good today. He later came over that night to smoke with Marie and I. The next day, I hosted at my job again, and asked if he wanted to get food afterwards. He said yes, and we went to dinner after work and talked about a ton of different topics, everything under the sun except for work. We talked about family music, life. I then asked if he wanted to go to Target with me, and he said yes. He was like,  “let me grab you a basket,” and proceeded to carry my basket around the store for me. He then said, “I’ll walk you to your car,” to which I replied, “it’s alright, I’ll walk you to yours so that I can give you your stuff.” Then I was starting to think that maybe something was there, so I planned a party just for the hopes that he would come. I invited his roommate, however he did not extend the invite to Isaac. So I texted him in private, and told him that he should come. His roommate left the party on his own, and Isaac said he’d pull up. My friends were there, and he came in and spent most of his time talking to me and we spent most of the night together. My friends left at 1:50 AM, and he stayed until 3:30 AM. We talked about music, family and life again. The next night we already had plans to go to a bar, but earlier in the day he asked if he could bring this girl we used to work with. I replied yes, which made me sad because I assumed he didn’t want it to be just the two of us. However, the girl ended up cancelling because it started pouring rain, but he said that he was still down to go if I wanted to. We arrive at the bar, we order, and I pay. We both head to an empty rooftop lounge where it’s still raining, and he tells me about his family and how his dad grew up, and how his dad, mom, and general family dynamic is with all of them. He shared that his father has trauma, and how that played into his entire family, and ultimately him. Then we realized that the bar was closed, so we left. He drove me back to my car where I asked when the next time I’d see him was, and he said he’d plan something and ask Allison (the girl that was supposed to come to the bar) if she wanted to come. That made me feel disheartened, because what did that mean for us? I left feeling very confused because I paid for everything that night, and usually he asks right away to foot the bill or to pay me back. The following night he texted me at a later hour asking to let him know how much it was so that he could pay me back. I then reply with, “it’s fine, I got it,” to which he replied, “I’ll send you $20.” A week later I asked him if he wanted to grab a coffee in the evening because I wanted to tell him how I was feeling, and didn’t want to bottle my feelings up. We ended up meeting, and we shared a usual conversation about our backgrounds and interests, and as I walked him back to his car, I confessed my feelings to him. My original plan was to tell him that I found him attractive and that I had been enjoying my time with him and wanted to see if he wanted to go out sometime. However, that quickly flew out the window. I ended up telling him that I developed feelings for him, and that I know he doesn’t see me in that light. I apologized so many times during the conversation. Although I know I’m delusional, he never directly rejected me during that conversation. He thanked me for telling him, and that he was glad I got it off of my chest. He asked if I wanted to still be friends, and I said “I don’t know.” I said I usually make things awkward and that if I got to know him more, I might develop more feelings. I then told him I know I’m probably not what his idea of beauty is. I know that it was very “pick me” energy for me to do so, but a part of me felt like it was true. Especially because the one guy that he said is really hot is Troye Sivan, and I do not look like him. However during that conversation, he did say that I was attractive, but I’m not so sure if that statement was declared out of pity. He then told me I could reach out to him whenever. I responded by saying that I wouldn’t because it would look desperate of me. He said he would reach out, and I told him he probably wouldn’t. He argued that he would, especially because he has a few books that I lent him prior to this conversation that he would eventually have to return (one of which was my all-time favorite and I had shared that fact with him). A few days after this encounter, I saw him at a party. I was originally excited to see him, but then my awkwardness got the best of me, and I ended up ignoring him throughout the night. I know it was disrespectful, but I was overwhelmed by seeing him so soon. My friend told me that it was really rude of me to do so, and I felt terrible. Not because my friend told me that I was being rude, but because I knew deep down that I was being disrespectful. I ended up processing everything afterwards, and decided to reach out to him two days after the party happened. I texted him and apologized for my actions, told him that I was sorry about how I treated him the other night and that it wasn’t my intention, and that I was still trying to figure out how to process everything. He hasn’t responded, and it’s been a week. I, however, found out today that he’s been reading my favorite book out of the collection I let him borrow, and I found out through a mutual friend that he didn’t think much of the other night. Yet, he hasn’t texted nor told me that. I’m just very confused of the whole relationship, and can’t tell if he ever even had romantic feelings to begin with, or if he was just being kind to me the entire time.

How do I go about this? Is this just delusion and wishful thinking? How can I move on if so, especially since many of my friends encouraged my feelings and spurned me on?

TLDR; Crush is avoiding me after a great time together. I admitted to my feelings, and now he ignores me despite the fact that he is currently reading my favorite book and involves himself with people and interests that were personal to me.",2,1748801387.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

It feels really strange like I never envisioned being a ~child of divorce~
I’m currently living in the family home with my partner- we’ve bought a house and should be moving within the next couple of months. But having been here saving for over 4 years I genuinely don’t feel too upset or shocked by the news. They haven’t seemed to genuinely enjoy being together for all of these years, more just tolerating each other’s presence. A lot of resentment hid behind jokes.
My younger sister (24f) recently bought a home and moved out with her partner. My younger brother (21m) is still in the family home too. He’s been quite troubled honestly since he was a teenager- smoking excessive amounts of weed, unemployed, low motivation. My parents entirely disagreed on how to handle things and honestly this house has been pretty dreadful to live in- so much tension. I think my brother is taking it kinda hard and feels to blame but I have encouraged him not to as ultimately they are the parents and should have been able to work together regardless of his troubles as their child. I also have realised that he is more a symptom than a cause of their problems.
So yeah. It’s weird being more emotionally mature than your parents, though I did realise it years ago. How I found out was a classic example- making my coffee yesterday morning, my mom announces “your dad and I are getting divorced”, no follow-up. Strange. So yeah, it’s very sad but it’s also been very sad to watch their marriage floundering over the past few years.

I’ve been in this industry long enough to know it’s 80% supply chain management, 20% vendor politics, and 100% heart if you care about the guest experience.

Two years ago, I lost my husband, Mark. He was a chef at a boutique hotel, and he *loved* what he did. One of the few things he lit up about, even on the hardest days, was working with a small supplier (let’s call them Brew & Comfort). They specialized in all the cozy touches: high quality robes, beautiful room coffee, scented sachets. He used to joke that they “made hospitality feel like a hug.”

After he passed, and after I found my footing again, I brought Brew & Comfort into the hotel I now manage procurement for. Part of it was because they were genuinely good. But if I’m honest, I also did it to keep a small part of Mark in my daily life. Seeing their logo on the boxes brought me warmth, even on the hard days.

But over the past year, things changed. Delays, wrong shipments, mixed-up orders. I stayed patient, partly out of loyalty, partly out of love. But last month, we had a big client weekend. Things went wrong. Robes were missing. The coffee was the wrong blend. Deliveries were late again.

And something just… clicked. I realized that I didn’t need to keep a vendor to keep Mark with me. He’s in how I lead my team. He’s in the pride I take in the details. He’s in the way I pause when I walk past a hotel kitchen and hear laughter and clanging pans.

So I made the call. I let Brew & Comfort go. I didn’t do it with bitterness. I did it with peace. I even emailed the rep, a close friend of Mark’s, and thanked him for the years of partnership. He understood. He even said Mark would be proud of the way I handled it.

I went home that night and didn’t cry.

Instead, I made a cup of room coffee from a new supplier. It was strong, warm, and smelled like something new. And I smiled.

🧠 Psychology nerd – I love reading psych books and learning more about what makes us tick. If you’ve got book recs, toss them my way!
💭 Philosophy – big fan of wondering what anything even means while forgetting my coffee (more like white monster) exists
📺 Anime – I love it. Recommendations very welcome (especially while I await JJK S3 like it’s my life source)
💪 Exercise – yes, I work out, but I’m also very open to diet cheat day inspiration. Send help. And snacks.
🎮 Super hyped for GTA 6 – it’s coming. We must prepare.
🩸 Dexter – yeah, I know. I still haven’t seen it. But I want to. Badly.
🛫 Flight sim enthusiast – I fly a lot of planes virtually, mostly commercial ops. Ask me about my favorite approach. Fellow avgeeks are more than welcome.

I like to think I’m chill, funny-ish, and a good vibe to be around. Whether you want to game, chat, share life updates, spiral over anime characters, or just trade snacks and philosophy quotes - I am your person.

* lived by myself, based in U Belt in Manila

* my Globe prepaid sim is 5G enabled

* using Nubia Neo 3 GT smartphone, which is 5G enabled

* my data usage averages between 8-10 GB per week. I feel the more comfortable data usage for me is around 14-15 GB (not counting downloads/updates) 

* subscribed to Go99+ promo, the one with free 8GB of 5G

I did some googling and found (from this subreddit) na Globe's 5G and most of their prepaid sim are a sham (the 5G data only gets used occasionally which I'm not sure why, even with ""5G preferred"" for nearly all selected apps in settings). I'm thinking of making the switch to Smart based on reading the posts in this subreddit. I read that you can actually keep the same number after you switch to other telcos. I still need a little convincing why Smart is better than Globe outside of their prepaid offers. and should I buy a pocket WiFi even though I just live solo? I'm an IT student, focusing on networking and cyber security so I do need lots of data for upskilling my IT knowledge. 

To summarize: What's in it for Smart that Globe doesn't have? Does it have better prepaid promo than my current subscription? If yes, how do I switch my current sim with the same number to Smart?

1l0vhhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l0vhhj/long_story_but_i_want_now_your_opinion/,Long story but I want now your opinion," Hi you all, I (25) and my ex (27) broke up one and a half months ago, and lots of things happened during this time. Moreover, I don't know how I should feel or what I should do regarding the relationship. 

Now this could be a long write-up. Here goes. (btw I wanna add I was really really really loving her she was sooo beautiful and soo amazing and great laugh and smile everthing about her still makes me happy. I waited to right moment to be with her, thus I was devastated. however she did not wanna see it )

So how come we and up with this? I actually don't know. 1,5 months ago, she said the word ""we need to talk"" Look I was not thinking the break up could happen because we were seriously good. but at the last moments of us because of the academic station of her and laboratory experiments that she must attend and family issues was keeping her to do something besides going short lunch breaks and little talks with me. however I was with her whenever I could, I was listening, I was putting the love work on me to help her feel at least a bit relaxed. so we meet up as I learned later she was not thinking break up at that moment however after we walked a bit she said to her self ""if I don't break up with him rn it would happen in 2 or 3 weeks"" so she broke up with me. but before as I said She was distant, and ı was okey with that . not with me but also with our friends and her friends. (ı know that because we were friends before, and then l had feelings for her then ı wanted to be sure bout my decision because not only me but our friend group was on the line and when I was certain that we can be more than friends, it happened)

First of all, this was her first relationship, thus I could get most of the things (ı had a really toxic 5.5 years relationship before that, and after 2 years, when it finished ı was okey to date and have a really good mind and morals to be with someone.) I was certain to be with her. 

Second she was really under a lot of stress, and I was always with her to help her with everything that ı could do. however most of the things happened beyond my capabilities,  

while talking this I said what was the issue (as all my friends and her friends and also everyone that heard the story from me and also her) she said ""I dont know"" I was trying to come up something I said is that my father(simply my father doesnt like her) she said no l said was it the things that I have done she said no and I just wanted closure like everbody else because not me but everyone is kinda confused. 

while break up talk in one moment she said"" there is nothing left for me I don't love you anymore I don't even wanna touch you I was trying to run away from you""(when ı translate it to english it seems a bit harsh yes it was but in my mother tounge it is softer) she also add that she was thinking the break up long time and the anxiety drowned her. I was dead on the spot after hearing all this. I just said to her "" I dont wanna see you l dont wanna talk you pls mind my boundaries and respect me.""

after all I suggested at least 1 week to give us to discuss again she said IDK and was crying all the time. She was like she did not wanna do that but like she has to. while talking she said ""dont think that I dont love you I like you but as a friend you are amazing friend"" I said are you kidding because 9 months of relationship and throw everthing then this words how should I feel.

so I should keep the story short, after break up I put so much effort on myself because there was so much things were happening with me at that time this was cherry on top. 

after 1 week I wrote her to meet up again and talk she said ""okey you have to because there was so much things left on your side""

we talked she glanced at me and said break up worked for you look you did your hair and your clothes you look good she said. I said I did not changed l am still me the clothes were bought before break up and everthing anyways we talked more than 5 hours. I said why did you break up what was the cause I said she said "" IDK "" again and again at that talk that she also said I wanna see you happy with someone else I said I dont I want to be with you and she said "" ı dont wanna try to work someting"" ı dont have the will she said"" I added that we are in same friend group and our departments are so close and we use same bus so there is no need to run away from each other after I said that she as sooo happy and feel relaxed. we hold hands together, we hugged more then ı count and most importantly after talk while I was going she asked ""can we kiss?"" I said yes and we kissed like 3 times and these were not like little kisses like long sensational and from heart I said it was meaningful she said ""a meanigful end""

after that 2. talk I was kinda down however I was started to heal then out of nowwhere (ı wish but anyway) she texted me some thing about the summer internship that was out of blue but I said l would help her no matter what (not because I was in any hope but I promised her to do someting about it)

so, then later the message my frinds and she meet up for a coffe (same friend group)  I meet with my another friend that night. While I was out with my friend my our mutual friend messaged me that he was coming to see me I said okey dude amazing then he add he was coming with her. I said okey because there was no hope in me up until that point she was certain about the break up and I was okey with it. whe came we talked she asked how I was I said I am bad I feel like shit I fought with my father ı said ( in a more good expresions tho) she said ""I wish you had opposed your father like this in some situations back then."" 

I said ""I did that my father started to listen now"" so I was kinda angry her that moment and also told her that but not in a fighting style more like explanatory type. so she went home I suggest to give a ride home  she said it would be weird I asked again and she denied so I did not push she went home. then my friend said"" dude she missed you while on the bus ride to you, she said that she missed you and talking with you while we were in the cafe she also wanted to see you and asked if it would be weird to come to you and with other mutual friend and I insisted that it would not"" I was still okey tho no hope however I was thinking that everthing can be better between us because I sense that she was not certain about her decision.

so after that night she had an accident big one and could not move her leg properly so was not walking easily after 3 days I wrote her because she did not tell me but I heard from our mutual friend I texted her she responded and we talked like 1 hour she was talking like everthing, I just asked if she okey and need anything. no lie I was happy to text and share again but the thing happend that moment after we finished and farewell to eachother she said "" I would like to take you a coffee date she said"" I said "" okey I am down with it whenever you are okey"" right that moment my hopes light up and I wanted to come back together.

however we could not see eachother I did not wrote her but I was hearing from mutual friends that she was doin okey but some things between the words the things she said was make them also confuse. then our mutual friends birthday come up I wanted to attent she was also be there we met up started to drink and talk like really long time and with jokes and everthing but sometimes she mock me (my age ""you are childish"" and most hurtful one while talking about our mutual friends single life ""I was single whole my life"" while looking at me everyone on the table was nervous at that moment) after talking and everthing I got up to study my exams and said goodbye to her and hug she was like why tho? and give a little hug to me I said ""it was really nice to talk and meet up and see each other away"" she just noded and I asked to hug again she said"" I don't think it will do you any good."" and went I was like stunned but I left the place

after that whenever we come by eachother in the campus or with our friends out of blue she just did not look at me and did not see me at all like I erased from the existence. I only wanted that our mutual friend to talk with her and it also happend 

but before that, My relationship with my father was very bad. I only wanted to be happy with my girlfriend  and have the necessary freedom, but he pressured me a lot and thought that being with my girlfriend would affect me badly academically. Of course, I was fighting with my father while I was in a relationship with my girlfriend, but he wouldn't listen. My father still doesn't know that we broke up, but I can make my father do what I say, and for the first time, even though it was much later, he started to see me as an individual, but it was too late. however I won over my fathers unnecessary over protectiveness and show him that I and him can live in my terms and also I am leaving house tot live with my friend. no more living with him.

my academical carrer was a blast this semester I probably be in honors my professors are saying that my path is clear and advise me to talk with companies for future opportunites.

and everyone around me says that I had grown up like my speech have changed my appearance have change my thinking style has change and I became very respected person. everyone in listening me and taking advices from me. usually it was me however the start of all of this is not the day I broke up long before that 

so I won every battle that I have encounter with really good achievements however I feel empty

lastly my mutual friend met with her. ask everthing and wanted to share some mind with her;

 he only said to me she is so happy rightnow, she is really happy that where I am and what will I do in the future. she was being distant to me for me to overcome stiuation between me and my father ,and fix my relationship with my father and be more independent. however she is still dont know the issue to break up. my friend told me that ""dude just move on and be happy she is not coming back""

 I bacame the everthing that she could wanted for me she still be with me but not he relationship but in friendship. but I dont want that I want her I want to laugh and be there for her I just dont know how should I feel. the coffee date will happen tho ı will talk with her everthing and just thinking to ask her that if she wanna try I am okey with it however if not I should draw a line between us.

thank you if you read up until this point mate appreciated.

1l0vfgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyBayArea/comments/1l0vfgb/historic_hayes_mansion_in_san_jose_carves_out_a/,Historic Hayes Mansion in San Jose carves out a hotel niche as it adapts to changing times,"Hayes Mansion has long been a landmark on the edge of San Jose’s Rose Garden neighborhood. Built in 1905 in a Spanish Mission Revival style, the 24-acre estate was once the private home of state senator Sarah and Thomas Hayes. After the city acquired it in the 1980s, the mansion found new life as an events venue and hotel, catering to weddings, corporate retreats and local tourism long before Silicon Valley’s tech boom reshaped the lodging market.

Like many hospitality properties, Hayes Mansion suffered steep revenue declines during the pandemic, when business travel dried up and group events were canceled or postponed. In response, ownership embarked on a rebranding and repositioning effort, aiming to turn a once-traditional conference-centric hotel into a boutique destination able to withstand shifts in travel habits and function as both a staycation spot and a hybrid work retreat.

Central to the renovation was a roughly $10 million capital improvement plan. Public corridors got fresh paint and upgraded lighting, while guest rooms were reconfigured—adding 12 new suite-style accommodations with separate living areas and kitchenettes. High-speed Wi-Fi, contactless mobile check-in, and in-room digital concierge services now address the expectations of tech-savvy visitors who still prioritize convenience and connectivity.

To diversify revenue streams, the property has leaned into its historic character. The grand ballroom and lush gardens continue to host weddings and private parties, but with a modern twist: outdoor “pop-up” lounges, fire pits and curated local art displays. Smaller meeting rooms have been turned into flexible co-working pods for remote teams, complete with whiteboards, video conferencing setups and high-end coffee stations.

From a real estate perspective, Hayes Mansion’s evolution underscores a broader trend in Silicon Valley: adaptive reuse of heritage buildings to meet contemporary demands. Rather than razing older structures for new high-density developments, owners are finding value in preserving architectural charm while upgrading functionality. This approach can anchor neighborhood identity even as the surrounding housing market grapples with supply shortages and escalating land values.

Financially, the property is targeting a post-upgrade occupancy rate north of 70 percent—up from roughly 50 percent during the worst of COVID lockdowns. Average daily room rates have been tweaked to align with premium boutique competitors, while still undercutting ultra-luxury brands. Meeting-room and event bookings, once the mansion’s bread and butter, are now supplemented by weekday coworking packages and local-resident staycation promotions.

Looking ahead, Hayes Mansion’s owners are weighing further enhancements: possibly a small spa pavilion, expanded outdoor event lawns and partnerships with nearby wineries and tech firms for branded retreats. Zoning constraints around the adjacent historic district limit large-scale expansions, but city planners have signaled support for modest growth that maintains the estate’s cultural significance.

In a region where new condo towers and office parks often dominate headlines, Hayes Mansion stands out as a case study in marrying preservation with profitability. Its niche positioning could serve as a template for other under-utilized heritage sites across Silicon Valley—proving that with the right investments, historic real estate can remain both relevant and revenue-generating in an ever-evolving market.

People are gross and they keep dumping things out their window. Nips are popular, coffee cups etc. I also constantly get people pulling over. Eating lunch and leaving their trash.

They do not pull off into the abundance of wild flowers and bushes that grow in other portions. 

My thought is to make it more attractive and push them into at least doing their roadside drinking and eating away from my house is to plant some more wild flowers 

Is there anything tall and preferably pretty that grows in poor and rocky soils? I figure if I can start making some inroads maybe I can at least move the problem away from me.

Currently on a 3,000 calorie cut after a calorie surplus. Weightlifting with a Push/Pull/Leg & Core split. Only 15 minutes assault bike sprints on leg day for a quad pump. Only rest days are if the target muscle groups are sore. I've had 2 rest days in the past 90 days. Goal is 10% BF.

Right after waking up:
8oz water
Protein powder
Creatine MH
Amino acids
No Stim pump

Black coffee and 1/2 tsp raw honey

After breakfast:
Onnit Total Human (Day)
K1/K2
Methylene Blue (1 pill)
Alpha GPC

Sometimes NAC (1 pill) around 10am

1 hour before bed:
Onnit Total Human (Night)
K1/K2
Alpha GPC

Energy is noticeably increased. No tiredness during the afternoons. Lifts are heavier, and pumps have been amazing. I've increased my weight from 195 to 210.

Focus is about the same, so not too sure I'll keep the Alpha GPC. No noticable difference.

MB makes me nauseous at 3 pills per day, so dropped it back to 1. That's a sweet spot for me. I'm guessing it's had a positive effect on my mitochondria since lifts are heavier and pumps are fuller. Lean mass has definitely gone up, but that's probably a combination of everything.

NAC gives me a strong stimulation feeling, but not like caffeine. It's smoother, but has a very strong effect on me. Personally, I don't like that feeling every day, so I only take it occasionally. For me, this is the strongest effect that is noticeable.

My shake in the morning coupled with the coffee and honey gives a smooth wake up. Shake is low calorie, and has the high protein I'm looking for. 

3k calorie cut I've been doing for 4 days, and visually I've noticed my abs showing more with no visual effects of any loss of muscle. The stack has me feeling that it supports fast muscle gain, while easily cutting down BF%.

1l0va1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0va1z/friend_is_ghosting_me_due_to_toxic_ex/,Friend is ghosting me due to toxic ex?,"My 27f friend still won't hang out with me after I 25f waited for her to break it off with her toxic ex. We both got into relationships 2 years ago. Mine has been healthy, hers has been off and on the entire time. They broke up at least 5 times. My friend and I have been very close since we met in college 6 years ago. 

We used to talk or send snap chat videos every day. Sometimes if something came up we would take a few days to respond but both of understood the other was busy. We smoked weed and did acid for the first time together, we went camping, we were the first people to tell each other we lost our virginity. We told each other our biggest most darkest secrets that we didnt tell anyone else. I'll call her Anne for this post. She said we were sisters and in her culture thats a big deal.

A few months after meeting her ex Brandon 24m, Anne came over to my place to hang out with me and my boyfriend Alex 24m. Within a few minutes she was telling us panicked how she felt violated by her bf. They had sex and he was extremely pushy and to me and my bf it soundes like coercive assault. My bf grew up getting along with girls more than boys, hes very empathetic and defensive about women and so he immediately reacted by telling her he was so sorry it happened, comforting her and then we both told her she has to get away from this guy. Remember she came in using the word violated, was almost crying but as soon as we told her we were worried and she should get away from this dangerous guy she switched up, she got defensive on behalf of this guy. Fyi this guy was living in his car when they met, barely had a minimum wage job, and immediately started emotionally manipulating her. She told me later they got into fights and he would chase her down the road in his car when she didnt want to talk, he would trap her in her own car to force her to talk to him, etc. No offense to people in a tough spot but all that info together paints a picture.

After she ran to me numerous times about fights and would rant to me for 2 hours straight about the same behaviors I got serious. Over the years we vowed to be brutally honest with each other and we always have been. I told her I thought she was trying to relive her toxic relationship to her parents who passed away when she was in highschool. I told her that she wants to change Brandon and that will cknfirm she could have fixed her parents. I told her she deserves someone who will always treat her with respect. Normally she would be receptive but again she got defensive but we didn't argue.

A bit after that she stopped communicating as much with me so i asked if I had offended her, which she said no to. Next time I saw her it seemed like this guys was controlling how frequently she saw her friends because he was so controlling and needy. But then she started telling me she hung out with his friends frequently. I was a bit hurt but assumed it was this dudes fault. 

FINALLY she broke up with him last month and she and I and a mutual close friend hung out and got coffee. Finally she will reply to my texts. I sent her a text asking when she had time to hang out-we used to hang out after work and smoke in my car and talk for hours. She said she would let me know and after two-three weeks never texted me back. 

I feel kind of heart broken, I feel like I lost a friend. I don't understand what I did wrong and I asked her twice if I hurt her ans she said no.

TLDR: 
my friendship issnt the same because of my friends toxic ex, is it over for good? ",1,1748800518.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1l0v9k9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0v9k9,From zero to… addicted?,"Ever since following this sub and gooning over these 8-legged cuties I wanted to have my own jumping friend.

I have never even seen an actual jumping spider in real life before. 

About 4 weeks ago I finally opened my eyes to this tiny world. It was a long way and in the beginning my first two kept escaping (but always came back to me!) and I learned a lot since then.

And now here I am - proud dad of seven (7 !) jumping spiders! 😅

Got 2 Salticus scenicus, 2 Marpissa muscosa, 2 Pseudeuophrys lanigera and one Heliophanus cupreus.

Some info about them:

Luca: She was my first jumping spider ever, and I found her on my balcony on the third floor of all places. She’s a pseudophyris lanigera, about 3-4mm in size and just layed her first egg sac with me! (Picture 1)

Mochi: She was caught by my dad on the balcony of my parents and is a Salticus scenicus lady of around 8-9mm. She’s a real beauty and was caught just after I actually lost a different salticus scenicus (Kuro I miss you!) who was a male and had just about her colors but inverted haha. (Picture 2)

Kohī: My toddler (who is growing up with lots of love for all animals, especially creepy crawlies haha!) caught him in our garden. He’s the heliophanus cupreus and was missing one of his front legs when we got him. He always misses the first jump, but also always perseveres! (Picture 3)

Momo: My beloved old Marpissa Muscosa Lady! When arriving at our garden my parents told me they saw the biggest jumper they’ve ever seen, but couldn’t catch it to show me. I eventually found her under the coffee table and just sat there with my hand placed near her den for half an hour. Eventually she made the jump and then chilled on my for what seemed to be an eternity! I didn’t want tinkers her initially, but she refused to go back to her den. She’s the largest and oldest by far (around 11mm at least!) and the most beautiful as well. 🥹 (picture 4)

Kiba: Just after I decided to keep Momo and before leaving the garden for the day I checked a place where I’ve seen a tiny Marpissa Muscosa Lady before, and when I checked this time I actually saw what i believed to be a little male! Just sitting in a crack in the wood. Directly on top of the little shed he was hiding in was a little gnat that I picked up and held near the crack. HE JUMPED ON THE GNAT I WAS HOLDING IN BETWEEN MY FINGERS!! And continued to eat it on my hand. That had to be destiny I told myself and brought him with me. (Picture 5)

Goma: The second Pseudophyris lanigera, also found on my balcony. He’s a bit tinier than Luca and I initially didn’t want to keep him as wellbut he calmly stayed on my hands for at least 15 minutes and refused to go back to where I found him. (No picture yet)

Kami: A salticus scenicus baby. An actual baby of around 1-2mm in size. Just found on my balcony this evening. Despite being so absurdly tiny you can already see his or her beautiful black and white pattern. Did the cutest jumpy jumps on my hand. (No picture yet)

It may seem like I have a problem but I pour my heart into keeping those little treasures! Even my arachnophobic wife loves them by now and is always checking on them and looking out for gnats and flies to feed them. My toddler also enjoys our many pets a lot (even more than our 2 Siamese cats I fear haha)!

Enjoy the pictures and sorry for the wall of text! 😅

I hate going to the dentist, mostly because I always end up drooling like a teething baby while trying to answer questions like “So, how’s school?” with four fingers and a suction tube in my mouth.

Anyway, I sit down in the chair, lean back, bib on, and the dentist leans over me and says,
“Okay, just relax and open wide.”

So I do.

And then.

I burp.

Not just any burp.

A deep, echoing, from-the-soul burp.

Straight into his face.

The man flinches. The nurse chokes on her coffee. I freeze like a criminal caught mid-crime.

And I try to save it—because, obviously, saying nothing after burping directly into someone’s face is worse, right?

So I mumble, with my mouth still half open:

“Sorry… I had a bnana earlier.”

As if that explains anything.

I am 5’7 and jump between 155-165 lbs depending on the month. Closer to 155 currently. 
Calorie counting is rough because of my ED past, I have trouble keeping up with it every day, and I don’t have a scale. 

I don’t drink soda. I get fast food a couple days a month, same with sugary coffee drinks. I drink water 99% of the time. I rarely eat pasta, pizza, stuff like that. I do like dessert though. I will make cookies, eat chocolate chips with Greek yogurt, stuff like that. 

I walk 10,000+ steps 3-4 days a week and other days I make sure to get at least half of that. I lift 2 days a week, wanting to try for 3 but can only fit it in my schedule consistently 2 days a week. I have issues with black outs and feeling faint, so cardio is hard because it triggers that. That is also partly why lifting is hard. 

I cook most of my food in the beginning of the week. I have a vegetable, protein, fruit with every meal and my sides vary between foods like corn, potatoes, and cheese. 

Is it possible to lose weight without forfeiting the dessert, potatoes, cheese? My meals are so boring without them. I’m wondering if I’m unintentionally consuming sneaky calories, maybe dessert? ",3,1748800185.0,loseit,4,1.0,False

I am finally feeling in a position where it is no longer burdening me and I can get on with my life. There is still a barrier at work I am trying to overcome though in order to do this and it has caused me a great deal of stress over the last month. During this period I haven't been going to church, I have not been praying, I have not wanted to read my Bible. I haven't lost my faith, I just haven't been able to rely on it because of my own faults.

I have been selfishly asking God to send me a sign and to show His love to me and help me without any effort on my behalf.

This morning I missed church again, but I finally had the energy to at least go out for a walk and get a coffee. I have mostly been lazying around at home over the last month. The local Methodist church were out offering free doughnuts to people, and I stopped to chat and they offered to pray for me. I carried on with my day, and whilst having coffee I had an urge. An urge to hear God. I had my prayer book in my bag, and I turned to the Collect and readings for the day. The first time in four or five weeks.

I started walking home after this and went a slightly different way I wouldn't normally go. A bus was coming in the opposite direction and pulled up at the stop I was approaching, and a lady got off and immediately saw me and asked if I knew were a certain street was as she had never been to the area before and wasn't sure on how to use her phone for directions.

It was pouring with rain and she didn't have an umbrella, so I told her I'd walk her to the street and she could come under my umbrella too. We had a brief, lovely chat about the weather, our plans for the day etc. She told me that she had hoped God would help her get to her destination. It was lovely. It was just two minutes or so, and when we parted ways she asked me my name. I asked as well.

Her name? Blessing!

Did God send me a literal Blessing?

I have just felt in absolute awe all day and I can feel my faith again. Perhaps the power of the Holy Spirit worked itself within me this morning when the Methodists prayed for me. Perhaps that is what drew me to want to hear God in reading my prayer book. Perhaps this finally opened me up again to God's love. Perhaps that is what took me on a different route home so that God could show me His love.

Glory to God in the highest!

Tonight I will pray for those who, like me, are finding it hard to turn to their faith at times where it is most needed. You are not alone. I will pray that the power of the Holy Spirit works within you so that you can also open yourself again to God's love.

I am in the UK working at a big coffee chain which i won't mention for privacy reason's.

The actual job itself i fairly enjoyed for the first couple of months making Coffe, and preparing the drinks for customers.

My workplace that i am currently in has two very toxic managers. I am constantly getting told off in front of customer's over very mundane things. For example sometimes the logo of the napkin isn't facing the correct way, not being polite enough or not working fast enough according to them.

I try to work as hard as possible and they keep telling me you need to work faster. I have told the staff and management as well i am autistic and suffer from Arthritis as well and still get told i am not being friendly enough towards customer's.

Our dishwasher for some reason doesn't seem to remove a lot of stains from cups and mugs which then again leads me to getting yelled when they aren't gone and have to sign and disciplinary form I tell you i wash the cups and mug's as hard as i can. 

Funnily enough i have not even realised for the first couple of months of the job i was promised a minimum wage of 11.44 an hour but was then only being paid 8.60 an hour because of a mistake on the contract? For a couple of months now i was left out on hundreds of pounds worth of wages.

We don't even get any breaks working 6 hour shift's at all which is crazy.

To make matters worse constantly inside the bar the tills don't work, ice machines stops working, it's just so frustrating sometimes how many things get broken.

I am not maybe as good as it comes to somebody with years and years worth of experience making i have gotten fairly used to making many of the drinks that we have. However for drinks that i sometimes am unfamiliar with haven't got any sort of training. Elearning as well can only do much as opposed to learning in person.

I have asked if they could transfer me over to any other branch that they have and they have said that isn't possible now at the moment either leaving me in a bit of a hard place.",4,1748799722.0,barista,4,1.0,False

Nine years of birthdays, movie nights, lazy Sundays, inside jokes, arguments, reconciliations, and plans. We were supposed to get married next summer. We already had a venue picked. I still have the draft of my vows on my phone.

But something changed. Not suddenly,  more like a slow erosion of the love I once felt so certain about. He stopped meeting me halfway. I was doing the emotional heavy lifting, the planning, the supporting, the forgiving. I tried to convince myself that love is about patience. About staying. About fighting for someone.

But over time, I realized I was the only one fighting.

He didn’t cheat. He didn’t hit me. He didn’t scream. And that made it even harder to explain to people, and to myself, why I left. But emotional neglect isn’t loud. It’s quiet and exhausting and lonely. I lost count of how many nights I cried myself to sleep next to someone who was supposed to be my best friend.

So yesterday, I packed my things and left the key on the table. He didn't try to stop me. Maybe that was the final confirmation I needed.

And now? I’m heartbroken. Not just from the breakup, but from mourning the life I thought I was going to have. I keep thinking about the little things: the coffee mugs we bought together, the playlists we made, the way he used to say “I love you” when he thought I was already asleep. I miss the version of us that existed in my hopes more than the version that existed at the end.

But here’s the thing: I’m proud of myself. It took every ounce of strength to leave. To choose myself. To walk away not because I hated him, but because I finally remembered I deserve to be loved out loud, not in silence.

I don’t know what comes next. I'm scared. I'm sad. I'm tired. But for the first time in a long time, I also feel... free.

If you’re reading this and sitting in that same aching limbo I was in,  you love someone, but you’re slowly vanishing in the process,  I hope you remember that staying in something painful just because it’s familiar isn’t strength.

Sometimes, real strength is in walking away with tears in your eyes, love still in your heart, and no idea what tomorrow will look like,  but still going.

I am also a convert from Protestantism, so I know the mentality and I feel like I am not attending a true Orthodox parish as one might attend in Greece or Russia, but an Americanized church for exvangelicals who want to cosplay as Orthodox. The liturgy is beautiful, our priests are both cradle (Russian American) and they do an incredible job, the church building is impressive. The congregation though treats the church as a social club. It's 1/3 college aged Orthobros, I/3 newly married couples getting pregnant, and 1/3 older millennial couples with kids. People are eager to show off their designer clothes and new cars, coffee hour feels like the lunch room in high school where everyone sits with their own clique. I don't think anyone takes theosis or the phronema seriously, it's all just a place to be seen and make friends with other white upper middle class young professionals.

I am 30, single, and work a blue collar job. People seem to look down on me and I don't fit in anywhere. There are no single women who attend, 0% chance of my future wife ever walking through the door. The orthobros are absurdly performative, crossing themselves every 12 seconds during the liturgy and practically hurling themselves on the floor when they bow. I've noticed none of the cradles are this theatrical. These dudes are not ascending to holiness either, which is immediately evident when you talk to them at coffee hour. I've stopped attending coffee hour and am honestly having a crisis of faith because there is such a disconnect between the social scene at this church and everything I believe about Orthodoxy. I've told myself the problem is me for a long time and that I just need to change my attitude but to be honest it's all getting a bit tiresome.",3,1748799633.0,exorthodox,2,0.8,False

I was getting out alive determined.

Not understanding that the complex only allowed one five minute call per inmate each week without pay. Having no money in my account, calling my parents to let them know, before being cut off unknowingly mid-conversation. 

A despot inmate, after me sneezing once from likely dust being in the facility; Accused me of having Covid, and started a fight that began with him charging at me to pull me off the 6ft top double bunk I was lying in.
I jumped off, scared from the drop. Him all in my personal space and area. Tried to chase him out of my bunk, to then be knocked out. I sprung back up, after hitting the back of my head on a metal bench seat.
An inmate behind me picked me up and led me back to my bed. Where I passed out for hours. 

Awoke in the middle of chaos, to have to defend myself from the guards never noticing on the camera.
The place was wild, with people smoking weed & spice in the showers. Passing lines of Coke through the neighboring cell block doors.
People coming in, and multiple jumping's were being witnessed. Where these killers left other inmates bathed in blood and tears from head to toe.

I hid amongst the Fear of God with the other prayer group of inmates reading Bible study in the block. With rife Hell Raising gang members telling me now ""Don't press charges against him"", thinking this was the only way out of the block.

Being told ""I was lucky because they stomped someone to death in this cell block here two weeks ago""

Now knowing from other inmates if I went into the medical or the suicide room. I could save myself.

Talking to one of the guards about in the morning to check back on the cameras, honestly trying to get out alive with my life.

Going to medical to be evaluated for my wounds after being forced by a gang leader to leave the block or else, after realizing staying in the block wasn't my best bet.

They transferred me and put me into cold isolation, given food with no utensils. No toilet paper, for half the day.

Officers came to my cell, after my claims in medical. Stated that I charged after him, and the person trying to hurt me wasn't trying to hurt me ""On their million-dollar camera system"", now me being the assailant when I never touched anyone. Knocked unconscious, apparently ""I was never knocked out"", since I got up so quickly.

Then they tried to mitigate the situation by trying to force me to sign papers saying that I wasn't going to press charges on him when I was now being arraigned on more different charges, going to trial now for two cases. In jail.

In the meantime, while waiting, arraigned by the magistrate. I got my other charges lowered to A & B misdemeanors with a $500 bond.
Being moved into another block after medical & isolation, waiting until further notice. Realizing I was now transferred to the Sex Offender's block, behind two locked steel doors.

I was unable to call my parents, and now also I do not know my account login & password. The inmates in the other cellblock stole my paperwork, hacked my account, and took the other $40 in my possession that the first officer gave me out of my wallet into their commissary for coffee.
I was unable to manage to get an officer to help me for days, obviously ignored intentionally. Buzzing on the intercom for hours throughout the day to help me log into my account to make one final call.

Being only told over the intercom, that I was being moved back into the same cell block that I started in.

I lucked out, and they had to sanitize the whole block head to toe because somebody complained about lice being found in their bunk. Shaving our heads off, and making us shower naked in front of them to make sure no spread.

I managed to convince an inmate into giving me a free 5-minute call, off his account. After two days. Telling me ""Never give up,"" after ringing me up a call.

My parents picked up, and I tried to calmly explain my situation. It ended in them telling me ""We'll be there to pick you up in the morning, we're going to bed."" Hung up on.

I hadn't slept in 4 days straight, on top of the week in psychosis before. I wasn't eating food, only water fasting with Kool-Aide sugar packet water because the food was inedible.

In the morning, before breakfast is served. I got my call to be arraigned on my second-coming charges, and then I was supposed to be moved back.
Walking in the hallway, and into the elevators.

Passing another Officer, that had my RO (Release Out) paperwork. Noticed my face, and said ""Is this ""....., ....... ?"". The officer handling me was surprised feet away from the courtroom.
Walked me in, and asked the Judge if I was ""Free to go?"", and the Judge nodded.

""He's free to go.""

I know everyone’s different, but listening has always been my weakest. Start ear training even if you don’t understand fully what they’re saying, do it anyways. It’s good bc at the base level you start learning how spoken French sounds but also you pick up on the right way to say words etc. Now that I’m edging on B2 & can understand more, I sometimes repeat after the speaker to mimic their accent & sound more natural. 

Some of my fave French podcasts for beginners:

- Passerelles
- Little talk in slow French
- Inner French (I know people say this is a bit more intermediate but if you wanna get to B2/ C1 level, this is definitely super basic). 
- Coffee break French

More advanced pods: 

- Les idées larges 
- Sur le fil
- Heure miroir 
- ⭐️ CURRENT FAVE: La question info (they have 1-3 min long episodes on more complex subjects. I listen to the same episode several times, speak to chat gpt summarising what my understanding is , put in the transcript & ask it to evaluate me based on that).
- Objectif tech
- Hugo Décrypte 

All in all, language processing in your brain from a cognitive pov is very complex and it’s almost like a muscle you need to grow over time. This happens via forming new neural pathways in your brain and is an elaborate step by step process with no shortcuts.  SO START EAR TRAINING EARLY!! ",5,1748799487.0,learnfrench,0,1.0,False

There’s a kind of loneliness that sneaks up on you. It doesn’t look like sadness. It looks like washing someone’s coffee mug every morning even though they haven’t touched yours in weeks. It sounds like silence when you say, “Can we talk tonight?” and the TV gets louder. It feels like reaching out in bed, again, and again, and touching only cool sheets but no warmth of the skin and the flesh that night.

For the past three years, I’ve been in a relationship that slowly, quietly, hollowed me out being touch starved.

I’m in my 30s, barely sleeping, being a recluse and in self denial, hiding in work and caffeine, and borrowed time. But through all of it, I still believed in love. I still left sweet notes in her lunch bag, still folded her sweaters when I did laundry, still whispered “goodnight, love” even when she rolled over without answering.

I don’t say that to sound like a martyr. I say that because I loved her with everything I had gently, steadily, openly. But I stopped recognizing the man I was becoming around her. I became cautious. Quiet. Smaller.

Being rejected so much, I lost the courage to reach for her hand on the couch. I stopped asking if she was okay when she snapped at me. I stopped initiating sex, or even hugs, because the flinch that tiny flinch felt like a door slamming in my face.

Touch matters to me. Not just sex though I missed that too, deeply but bodily closeness, skin to skin rub. Intimate play. Affection. I grew up in a house where no one touched unless someone was hurt. So as an adult, touch became my way of saying:You’re safe. I’m here. We belong. And when I didn’t have that anymore, I started to feel like a ghost in my own home.

What’s strange is how easy it is to rationalize emotional neglect when it’s not loud or violent. She didn’t scream or cheat or leave. She just… stopped showing up. I’d clean the house, cook dinner, light a candle, try to make our space feel soft and alive. And she’d come home, sigh, and scroll on her phone while I sat next to her hoping for a single glance.

I once brought her breakfast in bed just toast, coffee, and a few slices of apple. She was still half-asleep, and I gently touched her arm. She pulled away like I was a stranger. “Please don’t,” she mumbled. I stood there holding the tray, and I swear, something inside me just… dimmed.

When I tried to talk about it, she said I was too sensitive. When I said I missed her not just physically, but emotionally she told me I was making her feel pressured. So I said nothing. For months. I folded in on myself like paper. I slept facing the wall. I cried once in the shower, quietly, because I couldn’t explain to myself why I felt so profoundly unwanted by someone I loved so deeply.

Eventually, I ended it. And it broke me. Because you don’t just grieve the person. You grieve the version of yourself who still believed it would get better. You grieve the hope you packed into every small gesture. Every kiss you reached for that never landed. Every night you stayed up Googling “how to feel close again in a relationship.”

She’s asking me to come back now. She says she wants to try again. And I don’t hate her. I honestly don’t. But the truth is, I don’t trust that I won’t disappear again if I return.

I want a love that feels like mutual shelter. Like someone sees you running on fumes and says, “Let me carry a little of that.” I at least want warmth, If I dont have fireworks in my fate. Just hands held together through this journey. Shared life, not individuals. A sleepy “goodnight” and a squeeze of the hand that says, I know you’re tired. Me too. But we’re still here.

I don’t know if I’ll ever find that. But I do know what it feels like to live without it. And I won’t do that again.",3,1748799392.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I’m a chemical engineer with a background in data science, and I’ve been working on a new app that models espresso extraction based on a full range of brewing parameters.

The idea is to help dial in shots by letting you input your setup (bean, grinder, machine, environment, and technique), and get back an estimated shot quality score, along with feedback on how to optimize. It also learns over time using your actual results.

I realized how your choice reflects mine. I just had permission to love you and we both are extremely faithful and loyal people. Instability makes us dizzy and erractic even if that something is for the sake of love. 

We both choose a different love. Parental love. To protect our children from the consequences of our own actions. You were my mirror my soulmate. That doesn't mean we'd dishonor or children. 

I love you, we will meet again if my visions are correct. You will want to talk to me as life is short and a tiny piece of heaven is enough to grow old with. In my vision you are shy and sweet, a man. I'm fanning myself thinking about it. You saw how different I was in person compared to how you knew me online. I was smaller in frame then you remembered. You were everything I ever wanted and imagined. We we're both mature and handled seeing each other well. We laughed, had coffee and walked a cold night. 

I stay in the position I am in to protect others. I don't enjoy this lead but I'll do whatever I can to ensure no one else becomes my husbands victim or possible victim. I know I can do this as I am the only one holding due this fort. I never asked to become your wife I just liked pretending and dreaming of you.

If you came back now I think things would be different, I'd probably be close but I wouldn't thread over the line and if you said you loved me or I was yours I wouldn't tell you no, I'd tell you your right. I wouldn't fight you anymore but I'd respect the distance and mystery. I'd respect your boundaries and just enjoy your company whenever you wanted to say hi. 

I've got a cold today, I didn't tell you but I actually drink hot chocolate when I'm sick to get better. Works like a charm. Milk Swiss with marshmallows. :)

When I'm feeling overwhelmed I also have hot chocolate the warmth and heat relaxes my bones. 🥀

We currently live in different countries because of university, so we don’t see each other very often (she in Poland and I in Seville, Spain). We went to high school together in Poland and met there. Our relationship, I’d say, is pretty good, but ever since we both started uni a year ago, it’s been a bit rough.



I’m quite active in some Discord communities and met a girl (F19) from Sweden in one of them a few months back. We talked now and then and sort of hit it off. As friends, though - nothing more. I also had no intentions to move the relationship further than the platonic friendship we had. I was happy with my girlfriend. Note that I briefly mentioned I had a girlfriend a few months ago, but hadn’t said anything about her since.



For some school internship thing, she visited Madrid for a few weeks, so I thought it would be cool to meet up since I lived only about a 1-hour flight away. So, after talking about meeting up, I finally booked tickets for a weekend to spend the day with her. 



I did not discuss this with my girlfriend, though - but I know I should have. We currently only talk maybe 2-3 times a week, so it was difficult to find the time and the right way to say it.



Anyways, we met up and got some coffee and breakfast since I had an early-morning flight and wasn’t able to eat yet. Then we did a lot of shopping around the city and talked and whatnot. For the last few hours, we hung out at a local park. That’s when it started to get a bit more “romantic”. More physical contact led to her lying her head on my lap and us holding hands. In the back of my mind, I knew it was wrong -  but it felt right in a sense. I generally have a hard time opening up to people and getting comfortable enough to talk about deeper topics. But with this girl, everything felt so easy, soothing, and like it was meant to be. The few hours we spent together were really magical, and we connected on a much deeper level than I would have thought.



When it was time for me to leave for the airport, she kissed me. Not one of those short pecks but a more passionate kiss. I knew it was wrong - but I didn’t stop it right away. Maybe cause I hadn’t kissed someone for a long time and missed it, I don’t know. We kissed for maybe 2-3 minutes until I finally broke away. We said our goodbyes, and I flew home with no hard feelings. More of a feeling of sadness than anything. I flew out to meet this amazing person, and we had a great day, and all of a sudden, I needed to return home to my mundane university student life. Looking back, this felt more like a fever dream. I fell in love with this girl for a day, and it felt perfect.



I know what I did was wrong. I am ***not*** looking for sympathy. I’m just asking: what would be the best thing to do for my girlfriend, my friend, and for myself?



I could see myself in a relationship with this girl, but given that it would be long distance, I know it will be hard. I don’t know how to continue with my current girlfriend, cause I have these new feelings for someone else as well - which right now, is all I can think about. I have not told her yet since I would like to gather my thoughts fully to best explain this to her.



I did a bad thing to a good person, and don’t really feel bad. And I don’t know what to do about that.

Bit of a long post so bear with me if you can.

So my gf and I have been together for 6 months now. Back in our earlier days of college (6ish years ago I guess), she dated one of my best friends, who I’ll call Sam. I had met her but we didn’t really talk a lot. They broke up later that year but she was still loosely a part of our overall friend group. After the breakup, I’d only see her like twice a year at parties but when I did we always were naturally drawn to each other and would flirt and talk a lot.

A couple years later, we matched on tinder and went on a couple dates, nothing serious, just like coffee and she was at my 21st birthday party. We eventually got to a point where I wanted something romantic to start (we hadn’t kissed or anything) and so I kind of anxious-vomited about not knowing where she was at mentally and being confused. She said she liked me but that she wanted to be single and date other people since she never had people interested in her before (she was on the bigger side in high school and not a lot of guys were interested in her). I was really upset by this, even though I insisted that I wanted something casual, and so I pushed her away completely and went no contact. Looking back, I was at a point where I just wanted casual stuff with people but deep down I think I always wanted something serious but I was just afraid to admit it to myself.

Over the next couple years, I would see her periodically at events in our friend group but I never talked to her, it was painful for me to even be around her. I eventually got to a point where I was no longer hurt around her and sure enough we started talking at events again. The same old flirting and being drawn to each other dynamic began again, just like nothing had happened. But I never made a move on her or tried to talk to her outside of the couple times a year I saw her because I didn’t want to get hurt again.

Fast forward to 3 years ago, I find out that she slept with one of my other friends, we’ll call him Jake. Her and Jake went to high school together and have known each other a long time, and Jake is also friends with my guy Sam and is in our friend group. At the time I wasn’t really bothered by this because, again, I didn’t allow myself to get emotionally invested in her or her life. At one event, she said how she’s always wanted to sleep with me but couldn’t because I’m so close with Sam and my best friend, who she is also good friends with, and that it felt like she’d be crossing a boundary with them.

Then, at our friends’ wedding last year, we were seated together at the same table and sure enough we spent the entire evening chatting and laughing and flirting with each other. Per usual, I didn’t let myself get too invested and we went our separate ways. Except this time she reached out to me a week later and we started talking talking again. This led to a couple dates and then now all of a sudden I’m in a relationship with this woman. I will note that I did ask Sam if it was cool that I started dating her and he was more than okay with it and was supportive. I love her so much and I still can’t believe I’m with her. I have always been a sucker for romance but with her, this is the first time where I feel like I’m dating one of my best friends, not just somebody I’m sexually interested in.

Now here’s my problem: ever since things stared getting serious between me and her, I’ve been having obsessive thoughts about her past. Not so much about Sam, but really Jake. I talked to my gf about this because this is all new to me and she told me details about the night with Jake. She was very drunk, barely remembers the night, insists that she has never been attracted to him, and regrets what she did. She hates when I mention it and says that it’s a very traumatic experience for her and that she’s never been the type of girl to just hook up with someone (though she did with Sam a couple times over the years after they had broken up). She said she doesn’t remember going back to his place and did not go into the evening planning on hooking up with him at all. She knew she was too drunk to drive and so she stayed at his place, and that he only made a move on her once they got back to his place and that Jake’s bartender friend kept giving her drinks throughout the night.

Here’s the thing about Jake, I think the guy’s a creep. I’ve even had a few other friends say that he’s a creep. One of my best friends, his ex, thinks he’s a creep. He likes to act like he’s “one of the girls” and has even cheated on multiple partners before. It’s also frustrating because I think he’s a creep and yet his “charm” has worked on other women before. At the time, I knew that he was planning on trying to sleep with her but I didn’t know exactly when he was going to make the move. I told my gf about his motives and she was astonished to learn about it.

The issue I have now is that I can’t stop thinking about it. Imagining details about how the night went, did she actually want him and was in denial, and a bunch of other (probably irrational) thoughts and worries. She’s been very reassuring, saying that she’s never had a thing for him at all, that I’m so much better than him in so many ways and she knows how much of a creep and womanizer he’s been over the years and that she would never want me to be like him. She’s also said how I’m so much better than Sam. Her and Sam don’t talk anymore but they’ll be polite and say hello at gatherings while Jake moved away last year so she doesn’t talk to him anymore. She even said she won’t talk to him at events anymore because she respects my feelings.

My friend group likes to occasionally make jokes about the fact that she’s been with two of my friends before and it always makes me anxious. Anytime Jake’s name comes up in conversation I get super anxious. I wanna stop worrying about this and thinking about it all the time. I don’t even understand what my brain is trying to “protect” me from. Low self esteem? Fragile ego? I genuinely don’t know. And I know I can’t be mad at her because 1. We weren’t together when this happened and 2. I’ve also had casual sex, and I’ve had a couple drunk hookups that I regret.

I guess I’m just trying to figure out what I’m doing to myself and why I’m self-sabotaging. Aside from this, I’m so so happy with her and I still feel insanely lucky to be with her and she says how lucky she is that we found our way back to each other. Everyone knows we’ve always liked each other and we always joke how it makes so much sense that we’re together.

I will also say I have been in therapy over the years and that I am dealing with bipolar 2, ADHD, and based on my feelings and obsessive thoughts I’m guessing retroactive jealousy too.

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. I know my thoughts are irrational and that this is a me problem and not her, I just want to stop doing this to myself and I want to stop being bothered by these things.

I’m a 27-year-old military spouse (not by choice, to be honest—but I’m making the best of it). My husband just got orders to Fort Sill, so I’ll be moving to Lawton, Oklahoma soon. We’re coming from Washington state, which I’ve called home my WHOLE life—and I’m really nervous about the change.

I don’t know anyone in the area and would love to connect with some friendly people who live in or near Lawton. I’m hoping to make a few online friends now, so that when I arrive, I’ve already got a small support system—people to talk to, ask for advice, or maybe even meet up with once I get settled.

A bit about me:
• I’m in college studying political science (💙 girl moving to a 🟥 state—though I’ve heard “it’s purple, but the red areas are very red”).
• I’m a stay-at-home mom to a sweet 3-year-old.
• I love musicals (Hamilton and Wicked give me life), journaling, poetry, and iced coffee.
• I’m getting back into gaming—into Wizard101, slowly learning OSRS, and trying lots of cozy games.
• I call myself an “introverted extrovert”—my depression sometimes keeps me low energy, but deep down I’m always down for a good time and good company.

If you’re open to chatting, offering Lawton tips, or just want to connect, I’d love to hear from you. Feel free to comment or DM 💛

1l0u9ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/longtermTRE/comments/1l0u9ye/our_personal_healer/,Our personal healer,"In past week or so, throughout the conversations I had, readings and reflections, I've come to the insight-realisation that the greatest, ultimate, optimal trauma-release healer is our personal-Self, allowing and paying full attention to where our body-mind desires to move in order to heal itself.

In our personal history, we accumulate trauma onto our body-mind for various reasons, circumstances, etc. Some of us have more issues with rage-anger, others with self-esteem and self-expression, some with anxiety-fear; some have major issues with their back, others with their neck, shoulders, etc. Our specific trauma pattern is unique to ourselves.

What others can offer us are different ways, modalities, ideas of how to heal our trauma. Some may focus more on releasing anger, others on processing anxiety; some focus on mental reframing, others on bodily movement; some focus on the psoas muscle and others on the fascia, etc. The reason there are so many healing modalities that only work to some degree for some people is because the healing modality was probably focused and geared towards healing a particular trauma in a particular way that might work for some people, but may be much less effective to another. The only healer that fully understands intimately and absolutely, the trauma we have and what it takes to unwind and release the trauma, is our own personal body-mind that is our very self. I note that the best, most consistent, helpful healing modalities seem to be those that invite the patient to engage with their own healing, rather than follow a prescribed set of exercises or treatment/advice by another person (and no surprise, these types usually require more and more payment as if you are paying someone for your healing, when the ultimate and only healer is in fact your Self)

Along my 'healing' journey, I read, practiced and experimented with all sort of healing modalities, but never found one to be 'the ultimate cure'. There are all sorts of theories, all sorts of ideas, concepts, beliefs, but I found that very commonly, what worked very well for some could be utterly useless for another. With TRE, I initially tried and followed a few exercises, but after some practice, found that they just didn't have the 'effect' I was looking for. When I finally focused on allowing and tuning into what my body-mind actually wanted to do, how it wanted to move, the posture it wanted to take up, the energy it wanted to express, it was just as if a floodgate of healing and improvement opened.

So personally, the main significance of learning about TRE was its help in enabling me to recognise that I could directly look to target and heal the trauma in my body-mind instead of simply 'surrendering and letting go' and 'waiting' for the trauma to gradually drip off without doing anything. Instead, I could direct my attention and tune into how what my body-mind wanted to do and move to heal the trauma directly and deliberately. This was a game-changer in how fast progress can be made, because prior to learning about TRE, I would simply follow the spiritual teachings of 'surrender, let go, allow, don't judge the trauma', which worked well enough not to create new trauma, but was very slow in releasing current trauma. By actually deliberately focusing on releasing the trauma in the body-mind, I could sense and perceive the trauma being healed amd released far quicker and deeper.

the second way TRE helped was in enabling me to recognise that the dullness, background agitation, low level discomfort, periodic depressive moods, had to do with the trauma I was carrying in my body-mind that I could heal and release right now. I could perceive that the lump and ring of tension frozen and weighing down my neck and shoulders actually generated a background of tension and agitation, that the frozen adhesions and the solid, stagnant knots and lumps, were in fact dulling my life-experience, leading to  feelings of 'stuckness', 'heaviness', like a weighted blanket wearing me down, but I had been so used to wearing that albatross of tension around my neck and shoulders I had gotten used to it and did not perceive and realise I could work on releasing it. 

So as I was lying on my bed trying to release the tension-trauma in my neck (suboccipital triangle, traps, mostly on the right side of my neck), there were various observations I found interesting. When I pressed and massaged a particularly tender knot residing deep in the neck, I observed my left leg 'firing', as if the locked-up tension-energy I was massaging on the right side of my neck needed to be released and discharged by 'firing'-kicking-shaking-tremoring my left leg.

Then, I sensed that lying on my bed rubbing the knots and adhesions were not sufficient, and sensed that my bodymind wanted to sit up and use the weight of the head and neck itself to stretch against and pull apart the adhesions and tensions knotted in the neck. I found that, contrary to ideas of breathing deeply/ not holding your breath, or concepts of 'making sure your posture is good etc', my bodymind wanted to shift into a particular slouched posture that would optimise the stretch, the pressure applied, that by holding the breath, it could rest and relax into the stretch for a longer time, etc. I realised that if I fully tuned into what my body-mind wanted to do, where it wanted to move, how it wanted to stretch, whether it be 'tremoring', stretching, growling, yelling, tensing up, clenching etc, and simply allowed and followed where and how it wanted to move, it seemed to 'hit' the sweet spot of healing and release so incredibly directly and optimally. As one part of the stretch was completed, the bodymind would then shift and adjust to target another part, another stretch, adopt another posture, another action, and all I needed to do was to listen, allow and follow where it wanted to go.

And as I followed the bodymind and realised and noticed how much progress was rapidly and directly made, it struck me how obviously ineffective it was to follow or look for healing in another. The other person can never know intimately and directly our own unique trauma patterns; the other person can never know the exact, optimal pattern of healing that our circumstances allow for, that our bodymind needs to take. How could a coach possibly tell me I need to shift my weight to my right buttock in this particular angle and lean in this particular posture in order to exert this particular degree of pressure onto this particular part of my muscle knot? But because I was, to a large degree, trying to look for some external 'healing' modality or teaching that would work for me, my trauma-healing progress previously was so bloody slow and stop-start.

Anyway, when my practice of TRE became more focused on my neck-area and allowing-following-tuning into what my body-mind wanted to do, the frozen slab of trauma-tension thawed out very significantly and noticeably. Correspondingly, I felt a very perceptible lightness, relaxation and stillness in my life-experience - as if the dull cloud of dissociation has greatly parted - though I deeply suspect that my current experience is only in contrast to my previous experience, and as my tension-traumas are released, I could very well experience far greater and deeper levels of lightness, joy, peace then I ever experienced.

With regards to my neck-region, I would not be surprised if I made more progress in trauma-healing in that area in the last 3 days than I did in the last 5 years! 

Anyway, the main message of this post is simply a suggestion to deeply and directly allow, follow and tune into what your body-mind wants to do and move in order to heal itself. There should probably be a particular source of tension or issue that 'demands' your attention - that is probably what your body-mind wishes to deal with first. let go of all preconceptions and ideas of what 'healing' should be like, what should take place, how the body should move, what 'rules' or behaviors should be followed - and notice and let go of the fears and inhibitions around moving or behaving a certain way. Your bodymind may wish to spasm, shout, snarl, cry, kick, flail, grab, scrunch, stretch, shake, tremor, shake, clench, etc, and you may notice how often you had in the past subtly or unconsciously inhibited these movements due to the ego-mind . And of course, in following with the message of this post ; don't follow what I prescribe or believe in - its all about trusting your Self and your bodymind.

sidenotes that I am interested in reflecting on and others may be interested in reading; don't have to read if you're not interested

the right side of my sub-occipital triangle (back of neck) has been a primary issue for as long as I can remember growing up. My first recognition that there was an issue was when I looked in the mirror and noticed my right eye was 'smaller' than my left - it was a form of ptosis like forest whitaker (whitaker's condition is on the left side of his body),  due to my right eyelid 'drooping' over more. And why was this the case? Because the fascia of my right eyeball was 'pulled' slightly more into the socket due to the connective-relationship of the knotted fascia on the right side of my suboccipital region. since fascia is a connected, connective tissue, the 'knotted up' fascia on the right side of the back of my neck exerted a pull onto the fascia onto my right eyeball causing it to 'sink' into the socket, in turn causing the eyelid to droop over it. My right shoulder was also more 'sunken' and lower than the left side of my body- when standing upright, my right leg also 'appears' to be shorter than my left, and these were all cascading effects of the fascia on the right side of my body being 'pulled' towards the suboccipital region. Forest whitaker has a very similar issue on the left side of his body - his left eye is 'droopy', and the left side of his body is visibly lower than the right side.

The right side of the body is associated with the father, masculine, external world. Growing up, my father was relatively absent and mostly at work, and at home, he was a slightly threatening presence. He was rarely physically violent (but I can remember one time he whipped me with a wire when I was 'naughty') but definitely fierce and not a 'safe' figure of comfort or support. So, not clearly abusive, but not supportive either. There were also many quarrels and arguments about money with my mom (they lost a lot of money in a financial stock crash). My relationship with my mother was much better and I generally experienced her as a figure of warmth, support and love.

From this history, I can guess that I began to develop a lot of anxiety around my father, and in time, the 'external world'.  My perception and experience of the world was more or less how I perceived my father; slightly threatening, unsupportive, not overtly hostile but spiked with tensions that could potentially cascade into serious pain. The world was something I had to grapple, contend and struggle with, that would not support me unconditionally, that was uncaring and occasionally hostile. Thus, I developed anxiety patterns of scanning, assessing, ruminating over possible threats and dangers and solutions to 'deal' with these dangers. What supported me was my mother's support and love that gave me a strong sense of self-confidence and capability, so that whilst I did experience and perceive the world as unsupportive and slightly threatening, I also had a sense of confidence in my capability to deal with it.

I looked in the mirror today, looked at my right eye and noticed that it definitely appeared 'bigger', less droopy, and whilst there still was a difference with my left eye, it was noticeably less asymmetrical. Whilst there is some normal variance (when i'm tired the asymmetry is usually more obvious and when i'm relaxed, less so), i'm confident that the difference was more noticeable and significant than the usual variance. I really don't believe I am exaggerating when I say i made more progress in the last 3 days than the last 5 years.

Tracing back, I believe what happens when one is constantly anxious is that there is a vague sense of threat and thus, agitation as the bodymind keeps perceiving, scanning for threats and trying to think of ways to deal with the threats. this creates a constant state of tension that is tiresome and heavy. in a state of tension, one is also more 'closed' up, numb, constricted and contracted as the bodymind seeks to 'protect' itself - but this causes a numbing, constricting, contracting of the senses and life-experience. because there is less sensitivity and open-ness, there becomes a dulling and blunting of experience - life doesn't feel as sharp, radiant, pristine. the body-armor and anxiety-coping mechanisms thus have a dissociative-disconnective effect - no surprise, since constriction, contraction, numbing literally makes the bodymind less sensitive, less connected, and more distant to its experience of reality

Thus, a chronic state of anxiety not only leads to a constantly agitated body-self, but also a dissociated, dull, disconnected life-experience, leading to depressive feelings. 

Interesting, the past 3 days of progress and increased focus on 'tuning' into my bodymind has made me much more aware of how much tension there in my shoulder and neck. Whilst previously, I was 'numb' and disconnected, only cognizing a numb, dull discomfort, my increased sensitivity has made me aware of how heavy and weighty that tension is. The weight on my shoulders and pains in my neck have become more obvious even though there is significant reduction in tension and trauma. I can feel prickles on my shoulders popping up every now and then, I can lean into and stretch out kinks and adhesions much more easily and noticeably.

In the last 3 days, there is such a noticeable lightening, loosening, and relaxation that I am now incredibly optimistic going forward about the future progress I am going to continue to make. 

When i did my one-legged bodyweight squats, I noticed that, whilst I usually had a hard time balancing when performing the one leg squat on my left leg, this time, I felt a lot more stable and balanced. I recall my left leg 'firing' when massaging the fascia knot on my right neck and absolutely believe this is a consequence of my constricted fascia unwinding and thus, making the body more stable and balanced overall.

Feeling lighter, more relaxed - life feels gentler, stiller, and I experience an increased sense of contentment. But this time, it feels much more permanent, grounded - not the fleeting sense of contentment I would get when drinking a cup of coffee or being absorbed in a good movie, but a sense of ease and safety just Being. And this sense of stillness and contentment naturally makes me more patient, calmer, more optimistic

Around covid is when I first realized a lack of focus and the last few years have really been debilitating with my brain fog. I got to a point last year where I literally took an MRI because I thought maybe I am getting onset dementia or something, turned out everything with that was fine. Took a bunch of blood work for like 10 different tests and saw that my Vitamin D levels were actually really low. I took daily 5,000 iu supplements for a couple months but noticed maybe only a 5% improvement. I saw some video on reddit about a guy who had SIBO and took artichoke leaves and ginger together in hot water daily and it helped him cure SIBO but that's when my mind began to wonder, what about the gut? I mean the father of medicine Hippocrates said ""All disease starts at the gut"" so how can I test that? I took a stool gut test that cost me $500 with an interpretive results video and found out a number of things. First of all I had H. Pylori which the type I have does not cause me any pain, but I learned that. I also learned that my **anti-gliadin** levels were 221 and I remember the person who was explaining the results in the video mention a possible sensitivity to gluten. So what has my diet been like in the last 5 years? I absolutely have to drink my latte daily (coffee+milk), I ate a bunch of bread , and of course sugar. The culprit was in the bread. But I personally think it was in the daily pasteurized milk I was drinking with coffee too. Barbara O'Neill which is another powerful figure I found on YouTube explained those are the three most harmful things you can put in your body. They need to be replaced with healthy fats, generous protein, and high fiber. I wanted to be so strict with my diet so on May 7th I fully cut caffeine, milk, and all gluten products; my three biggest weaknesses. I started cooking at home nearly everyday and made my own salads and meals trying to avoid seed oils too. The last few weeks have been transformational to say the least. I also bought Coconut Milk Kefir (no dairy) with 1 Trillion Probiotics and started drinking that daily for a week now. Of course this isn't easy, but I now truly do believe that food can be your medicine but it can also be your destruction. I would say I still have some focus issues but that's mostly because of my overconsumption of social media use and I would not say I feel absolutely light as a feather but there has been a solid 80-85% reduction in my brain fog. This took me 5 years to figure out and I know every case is different but I hope you find your answer soon too.",11,1748798068.0,BrainFog,4,1.0,False

Detective Elias Rourke stepped past the constable’s chalk lines behind Milliner’s Row, pulling his collar high against the damp. The alley reeked—sour meat, soot, and something older, deeper. Rats skittered as he approached the body.

He didn’t need to ask who had done it.

She was waiting again.

Same as before.

Amaya sat beside the corpse on an overturned crate, hands folded in her lap like a schoolgirl at chapel. Her black boots were spotless. No blood on her gloves. The boy’s throat had been opened cleanly—no mess, no hesitation.

Surgical.

She watched Rourke with unblinking eyes, their colorless clarity more unsettling than any madness. No triumph. No regret. Just... stillness.

“Evening, Detective,” she said. Her voice was quiet and flat—like the last echo of a prayer long forgotten.

Rourke studied her in silence, then glanced at the boy.

“You ever run?”

“I’ve never needed to.”


---

The Interrogation Room.

Gaslight hissed and fluttered. The plaster walls peeled in long strips, like skin. Rourke sat at the edge of the table, sleeves rolled to the elbows. A cigarette trembled between his fingers, barely lit.

Across from him, Amaya sat with iron cuffs circling her wrists. She hadn’t spoken since her arrest. Not until now.

“You look tired,” she said.

“It’s been a long week.”

“You haven’t slept in three days.”

He raised an eyebrow.

“You’ve had six cups of coffee today. No alcohol. Your pupils are dilated. Your left hand twitches slightly every time you inhale.”

She tilted her head. “Do you always lie so poorly?”

He stared at her. “You always watch this closely?”

“It’s how I survive.”

“No. You survive because the law hesitates.”

She smiled—barely.

“Let’s talk about Gunther’s Lane,” he said. “Seven-year-old girl. Missing for two weeks. Found wrapped in white cloth, left in a pew like an offering.”

Amaya was silent.

“You cut her open. Took her heart.”

She blinked slowly. “It was an experiment.”

Rourke slammed his palm on the table. The cigarette ash snapped.

“What the hell is wrong with you?”

“I ask myself the same thing.”

“You cut out a child’s heart!”

“I didn’t hate her. I didn’t feel anything at all. There is only a gap where emotion should live.”

She raised her cuffed hands.

“This is my shape. But inside? There’s only observation.”

He sat back, jaw clenched. The cigarette had burned out.

“You know what they call you.”

“Monster. Devil. Abomination.” She shrugged. “People need words to protect themselves from mirrors.”

He narrowed his eyes. “Mirrors?”

“Yes.” Her voice barely stirred the air. “Because if I’m not a monster, what does that make you? The soldier who shot children in the hills of India. The detective who let a man bleed out because you feared the dark.”

His mouth twitched. “You don’t know—”

“I don’t feel,” she interrupted. “But I notice. I smell guilt like rot. I hear it in your breath. You want me to be evil. Because it means you aren’t.”

He stood abruptly. The chair screeched back.

“I sleep at night,” he muttered.

“Do you?” she asked.

The bell tolled again—faint, outside, far away.


---

The Execution Chamber.

The room was white—too white. The paint had a sickly yellow sheen in the electric glow, like old teeth. The air was still. Too still. As if even the walls held breath.

Amaya sat strapped to the chair, the copper headpiece gleaming dully above her brow. Her hair had been tied back with surgical precision. Her face remained unreadable.

Behind the glass, officials murmured. Journalists leaned forward with pens poised. Rourke stood at the back, hat against his chest.

No one met his eyes.

Amaya’s gaze moved through the crowd—not searching, only cataloguing.

Pain. Anger. Curiosity. Fear.

So many faces. So many masks.

The warden stepped forward.

“Any last words?”

She looked at him. A beat passed. Then another.

“Will I feel it?”

Confused silence rippled.

“The pain,” she said, voice low. “The pain that teaches. That molds. That makes humans real.”

Her eyes turned toward the glass. Toward Rourke.

“I wonder,” she whispered, “if it will make me real too.”

A long silence.

Then the switch.

Her body arched violently. Fingers splayed. A cry escaped—not of fear, not of agony—something raw and unnamable. For one moment, something sparked in her eyes. Something alive.

Then stillness.

Eyes open. Staring.

And in them—faintly, perhaps impossibly—was the shimmer of something that might have been recognition.


---

Rourke lingered after the crowd dispersed. After the officials left. After the corpse was wheeled away beneath a white sheet.

He lit a cigarette.

The match shook in his hand.

The bell tolled again, far off.

A flicker of ash dropped to the floor.

He stared at it.

He still didn’t know who the monster had been.

Hey my fellow Indian Redditors,

If you've ever been curious about what to do with extra fruit in your backyard, home winemaking, beer homebrewing, or just want a chill way to earn some extra cash, keep reading on. 

So, what's the deal?
We're looking for folks to join us as MOB Rangers. Think of it as a part-time, remote sales gig, but without all the usual corporate stuff. Seriously, there are no quotas, no boss breathing down your neck, and you work completely on commission. It's all about sharing something cool you believe in.

Here’s what you get to do:
 * Learn home brewing from our awesome Brewmaster. We'll teach you everything you need to know to make your own fruit wine in 7 days or probiotics made from any tea, coffee or fruit juice in 2 days. 
 * Get a free Ultimate Brewing Kit (worth Rs 5999) or Probiotic Starter Kit (worth Rs 2999) to get you started.
 * Be our local rep at community events and workshops in your city.
 * Earn a flat 10% commission on every sale you make.

Who are we looking for?
Honestly, if you're enthusiastic and keen to learn, you're probably a good fit. But to give you an idea, we think this would be great for:
 * College students (18+)
 * Young professionals
 * Micro-influencers
 * DIY Enthusiasts
 * Bartenders

Why are we doing this?
We want to promote the sustainable hobby of homebrewing and reducing fruit wastage by turning fruit which would go to waste into probiotics or wines and beers. We're a bootstrapped Indian startup, and instead of blowing a ton of cash on traditional ads and giving money to Facebook or Google, we'd rather share our revenue with you, our MOB Ranger! We believe in the power of word-of-mouth, and we think the best way to grow is by having passionate people like you spread the word.

1l0tszk,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakeland/comments/1l0tszk/community_farm_garden_plot_idea/,Community Farm / Garden plot idea,"TL;DR Thank you Lakeland, specifically this subreddit r/lakeland, for supporting my farm through the years and also, how do you feel about having some community garden plots at the farm? 

Hey y'all. I've had my six acre organic vegetable farm  going in Lakeland for over ten years as of this year! I could not have come this far without the support of amazing people in this Lakeland community. 

Eight years ago, I responded to a post on r/lakeland asking about locally farmed produce. I was (still and always have) growing heirloom Florida varieties in the soil without any pesticides, sprays or synthetic fertilizer. That response on the post snowballed into a CSA produce dropoff (like a weekly supply of seasonal veggies) at Hillcrest coffee which is still going to this day. Eight years! I cannot be grateful enough. It's almost confusing how kind and supportive that little CSA thing has been at Hillcrest. So if you have ever subscribed to the CSA, bought from me directly, visited me at a farmer's market, bought my plants at the Nectary or attended one of my classes there, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! 

On to my actual question here lol.

I feel like now, more than ever, not only is it super important that we know where our food comes from but it is important to know how to grow our own food as well. I teach classes on growing crops in Florida and even just released a little book on how to grow those crops. But I want to go even further than that and I'm asking y'all what you think because this is where my CSA started. 

What would you think about having a place at my farm where I section off growing plots or have raised bed areas where anyone can grow there own food? Obviously it's like a community garden but I want to it be more educational focused. I would like to see it be a place where the community can come to an actual farm but also learn and grow food! I think things like classes, meetups, seed exchanges and all different kinds of workshops bring people together in the best way. 

I truly think, given all the growth in Lakeland, that something like this is needed and would be an amazing step forward for this community. My farm is located in South Lakeland off of Pipken. 

What do y'all think?

A bit of a refreshing take:

  
Firstly the way the game is currently heading is rather healthy for the long run. Once we get more Mythicals the older ones will feel obsolete/ washed in comparison to the fresh new ones and unlike the Ascenting of 2\* Heroes this time the devs can/will make money with this either through Packs or the soon to be added paid-gem-shop which speeds up the mythical hero grind.

Secondly the changing rewards are rather nice we get like tripple the coffee and gems on weekends than before. 

  
In addition to that I think Robin might steer this ship into the right direction if they show us that they can make more than a 6-level world without any progress regarding the story. I don't expect world 18 final vibes but something bringing us actual excitement. For example use the things we currently got (Farm, Ranch Exploration etc...) again nothing world breaking but things that can keep the players at bay without dropping the quality of the story. 

  
And lastly what this game really needs is a spokesperson from the community that ""can"" be seen as a collective stand, cause despite all I said without proper communication between Robin/Dev-Team and Community there won't really be any big changes regarding current problems (why in gods name can't i close the mission tab that is obstructing the middle part of my screen).

I asked why, she has a TV, all of her toys, and all she does is play games on the cellphone he gave her. She could still come out to eat and use the restroom, I just didn’t want her playing in the living room where I hang out with the baby when he is awake and getting him sick.

Flavor wise i have 2 types: honey from new pots and honey from old pots. The one from new pots are caramelly, somewhat floral but way too sweet. The old ones are not as sweet, but very floral (almost too much) and sour with fermented scents.

I tried to make tea from them and it had perhaps the preferable way so far. But idk how other cultures do it so im asking if others would know. These things would cost a lot (70usd per liter) so i dont wanna make mead out of it or anything. Spreading on toast for some reason was not pleasant

We had a hard time getting together for our first date because she was in the middle of a move etc... 

We did finally meet for coffee and it was nice. Good kiss at the end. She's certainly in a ""transitional"" phase of her life. 

But since then, about 3 weeks now, every time I ask her when she wants to get together, there's always something going on in her life that makes her not want to leave the house. Like oh, I did some ketamine this morning so I'm going to stay home (yikes). Or my daughter wants to hang with me tonight so I can't go out (daughter is like 20) or I had microneedling done on my face so I look kind of weird and can't get together for a few days. 

She also says that she doesn't like to make plans ahead of time. It's kind of same day or I get I'll get back to you. 

Every time she says no, she also says ""but thanks for the invite and keep asking please"". 

I usually apply to what I call the Casino Rule here. I picked it up from somebody on Instagram I think. So with the casino, you walk in with as much money as you're willing to lose and then you walk out when you run out of money. It's a technique for reducing the regret. In dating, this means that you apply a certain amount of energy and if you're not getting a return on that energy you call it off. I think I've hit that point with this woman.

I moved away recently from an abusive relationship (both in love and in family) and I had to leave a lot of things behind, whether I wanted to or not. Including my Nespresso machine. Upon reaching my destination I was getting things for my new place when I came across the Beautiful espresso maker on clearance that came out to $80 with tax. And stupidly, in a pure panic buy because I cannot deal with people without coffee or espresso, I got it.

I can hear the anguished screaming right now, you can stop. Because lo and behold two months later, the pump failed. Nothing would fix it, not priming it, not descaling it, not even “factory resetting” it as I talked with customer support. And when all had failed and I asked support what I should do next, they didn’t care that I had only had it for two months, all they said was “just go buy a new one”. He might as well had told me “fuck you, give us your money again because profits are more important than customer satisfaction”.

I could always get another Nespresso machine, but that will take weeks, and before anyone says “go to Target/Walmart for a new Nespresso”, the closest Target/Walmart is a 3 hour drive. No thanks. And no, I would rather die before I get another Keurig, I have lost count how many times I have come into contact with a Keurig, only for it to smoke and/or pop the second it finished a cycle.

So, should I just bite the bullet and get a new Nespresso, or is there a better machine out there that won’t die after two months?",1,1748796392.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I recently aquired a used Fiorenzato Bricoletta Volante from Ebay. I had not planned to buy this machine specifically, I was just looking for used machines on german Ebay that where in my price range (max 500€). It's from 2016 an works fine, the caveat was, that a thorough cleaning was required. 

Now I sit here with this machine and have to give the 1ZPresso handgrinder back to my colleague. I am unsure what grinder to buy for myself. I keep looking at the Niche Zero, but it's likely to cost me 700-750€ total, which is outside my budget. 

I was thinking about the DF64 Gen 2, which I can get here for 400-450€. Is there a better single dose grinder in my price range? I keep reading about its drawbacks, which worries me a bit. 

Generally, I prefer medium to darker roasts and only occasionally sprinkle in light roasts. I also still want to use my Bialetti and would like a grinder, that can also grind coffee for that one. Does a flat burr grinder make sense in that case? Or should I look more at conical grinders, like the Niche?

Thank you very much for your help!

Also, here's a picture of my Bricoletta.

Hi everyone 👋

I used to have no idea where my money was going. a coffee here, takeout there, or that app subscription I forgot to cancel it all piled up. One day, I added it up with my friend and realized I was spending about $1,200 - 1,500 a year on coffee alone. My buddy laughed and said, “Dude, you could’ve gone to Italy with that!” That hit me hard I kept thinking, “Man, that could’ve been a new phone or a weekend trip.” 😅😅

That moment pushed me to take control of my spending. Most budgeting apps I tried were either too complicated or loaded with finance jargon, so I decided to build something better: xWalletPro, my side project. It’s designed to **catch those sneaky small expenses in seconds** and give you clear insights, like “Wow, $200 on takeout this month?” **No cluttered charts or Wall Street terms** just info you can actually use.

What makes xWalletPro different is its **AI forecasting tips**. Unlike standard apps that just show what you spent, it predicts what’s coming, like “You might overspend on groceries this month.” It’s a game-changer for planning bigger goals, like a vacation or a new gadget.

Right now, I’m experimenting with some forecasting features to make it even smarter, but I’d love to hear what you think about the first version. For the predictions to get really sharp, I’d recommend logging your expenses regularly for a month or two it learns your habits over time.

xWalletPro super simple: no setup needed, works offline, and keeps your data private (a must for me). **It’s live on the** [**App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-tracker-ai-xwalletpro/id6744541339) **if you want to check it out.** I’d love to hear your thoughts.

My previous post is here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1kc3eec/1\_month\_in\_mentaly\_negative\_physicall\_not\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1kc3eec/1_month_in_mentaly_negative_physicall_not_the/) 

I'm adding this posts to see if there is a real improvment after months. I would be so happy to overcome this, and look at my old posts and see my mindset and body recovering

**Mental side:**

I stated that I'am mostly mentally affected but suprise suprise it has changed! Now I'm also physically affected and I feel I can walk less and less. In this month I have an average of 8k/steps but with more effort than before (I have to take more breaks during walking and sometimes standing due to my back pain). Mentally I would say its worse too: I still have an obsession in this subreddit and flox report which is definatelly negatively impacting my mental health. I'm waiting for 6 month mark too see what was my inital reaction - I feel like I might be the ""severe delayed"" because I'm only getting worse (in my opinion).

I have literally only my FWB who REALLY understands me, who really wants to help me,  WHO FUCKING BELIEVED ME AND TOLD ME THAT HE CARES - offered me help with washing my car and cleaning my home - I refused but it's good to have a support. He spents some time with me, I would love to have him by my side 24/24 - we watch series, sadly after sex I kinda setback because it's too much for me in some positions and now my neck hurts when I look down :-: I told him that it's good that he sees ""me in me"" because I cannot recognize myself anymore. 

Other person who listens but not really believes me (I feel) it my psychologist - I went to her with totally different problem but I have only one appointment and after I was FUCKING FLOXXED and the topics to discussed changed - now my illness is the top topic. She doesn't know sometimes what to say -I understand. I told her my main issue is that I don't have a support (luckily I have some savings and fastly calculating it would allow me to live on fair level for year if I would lose my job - that's the only good thing).

My parents don't believe me. They think with PT I will be fine and I just overdid it (i wish...). They told me to stop reading horror stories and my insomnia will improve (I agree with stopping reading but not with the fact that getting rid of insomnia is so easy). My biggest fear is I won't be able to work (I have a physical kind of job) I will loose the job and I will literally have to kill myself because I don't have their support - they told me I have to work to pay for my bills. I just wanted some empathy from them, just simple "" It's gonna be ok, you gonna make it, if not - we will help you"". I just want them to huge me as they used to when I was younger.  

So... Basically I cry everyday. Sometimes at work. I cannot focused - reddit become my obsession. I'm glad that ""floxie hope"" did not pull me in so badly. Or facebook groups. If someone is talking to me it;s so hard to focus on their words because I have only my symptoms on mind and the fear of unknown. If I try to read book or watch series I end up scrolling recovery stories after 5 minutes - im fucking drowing. 

My quality of life is like 0 right know. Im scared of moving, scared of resting, eating and about my future and loneliness... Its soooo sunny right now but I cannot find a comfortable bench on which my back wouldn't hurt :c

**Most bothering symptoms now:**

\- lower back pain, while walking, standing sometimes when I sit (I notice that this might be a sign of overdoing) and sometimes if I sit without a support. It kills me because I cannot walk as far as I HAVE TO in my job 3/10, now I feel it's spreading in my upper back :C I hope I won't add a post on 3 months mark that it's even worse. 

\- neck, shoulders pain - I dont know if it's tendon or muscle - I have a huge flare up I described below 6/10 during flare

\- insomnia - in this month it seemed to improve - I can fall asleep easier, I rarely wake up in the middle of a night althought I always wake up very early (always before my alarm clock 5-6a.m), I don't know if it coincidance or not but I saw an improvment after giving up on melatonin. I still have days when I sleep only 5 hours 5/10

\- of course anxiety, sucicidal thoughts, lack of focus - I suspect it's mixed effect of cipro and my previous past with different and various mental problems (ED, depression and neurosis) 9/10

\- I did not have my period in this month. I didn't found any other girl here with similar problem so im concerned

**Not bothering but existing symptoms:**

\- muscle twitching, tintinnus, joints cracking - those are not constant - occurs very rarely. 

\- calves tightness when I wake up (I have to move for let's say 10 minutes to get rid of this feeling)

\- I don't know if its my imagination but I think that smallest wound heal slower - being cut from knife heals 3+ weeks and it creates a red/pink area and after some time layer of skin peels of 

\- calves discomfort while walking still exsisting but not always 

\- 1 eye floter - dark spot, it appeared 3 weeks ago and some ""bubbles"" when I look at the sky. 

\- headache for aproxx 2 hours per day, not everyday - probably when I'm stressed 

**Improved!:** Dry mouth in the morning, waking up with numbed hand/legs, constipation, utheral burning, tingling in different positions definately has decreased! But... It wasn't a big deal. I'm waiting to see bigger improvment in my muscle/tendons problems :C

**Supplement**: Still taking a bunch of them

**Flare ups:**

Yeaaaah. In previous post I write that I have to move out due to break up. I was carrying very heavy cases and bags like 10 times form 7th to 0 floor and then to 2nd floor without lift. Definately it made worsen my weak arm muscles that connects my neck with shoulder (supraspinatus muscle). After that I wasn't able to hold a cup of tea with my right arm for couple days - funny I feel that this post is so long that I will experience a flare up too after typing this...

**Positive things:**

I was able to participate in buisness trip I was describing before. I couldn't focused on lecture but I was able to have fun, speak with my collegues and in very polite way tell them why I don't drink. I was so exhausted that I went sleeping at 10 pm but no one asked questions. It was trip to very lovely winery near to river and greeny fileds. I felt good there and my next 7 days were also super good mentally. I was happy and almost 90% back to my old self. I hope it will be more days like this in the future. 

I'm still keeping up with anit-inflammatory diet. I plan to drink coffee at 3 months mark, I have coke zero and I dont think it affects me, but rather wait with coffee. I won't go swimming probably very long. I dont even what to set up a date not to feel dissapointed.

**Personal events:**

\- I wish I have any plans for the future - now it's more like a surving till the next day - will this feeling ever end? Days are sooo long right know. I'm afraid Im waiting for recovery that may never come - I dont really know how it is possible to get better with all those muscle problems :c. I will meet with my coworkers at Thursday - they will be drinking vodka as crazy and I will try my best to just forget that Im screwed. I dont even know if I will be able to reach to the bar... 

\- With my ex I had planned a flight to Albania but I will be (if I wont kill myself) only 3,5 months out so I dont think its a good idea to go to another country alone in such a bad shape. I dont even know if I want to...

\- Im very seriously thinking about taking sick leave. Everyone will hate me because there is so much job  to do and high season but my health is the most important thing - even if its invisible illness no one believes because it hasn not got a fucking code... Im just scared that I will go mentally even more down that I am now. I would love to have a desk job right now...

**Questions:**

I will be okey even with flare ups or no? Should I walk with pain 2/10 or just stopped. Is it really possible to live without pain after that? I don't believe I will be able to walk 8k steps without pain one day. I'm not even thinking abou coming back to running.  I feel it's past memory. Maybe swimming one day but I don't think so. Im so scared of doing something wrong, but no one knows what is good and what is wrong :c Is it really getting better - when? I cannot rely on my body, on my mind, on other people... what else do I have?...

1l0tbcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1l0tbcy/presentation_anxiety/,Presentation anxiety?,"Hello everyone, I (44 male) have developed an acute anxious reaction to.. presentations, speaking in public or over Teams, or simply asking questions when I don't know the audience or top management (directors, VPs present).

I have never enjoyied presenting or being in the spotlight but i have never experienced such symptoms. My hands get cold and shaky, my voice changes, my heart beats so hard that it hurts, i absolutely cannot speak etc.

It's really bad and I can't control it.

I am seeing a phycologist/therapist since a couple of weeks but i have the feeling this will take a very long time to fix (i assume some self esteem issues down there, mixed with being raised during comunist regime when speaking up in class wasn't really welcomed, plus a mother who was always comparing me with my better colleagues etc).

Anyway - I am going to have a call with a psychiatrist tomorrow. I would like to ask him for a receipt for propranolol as I read it can help in such situations.

I decided to quit coffee - currently i drink 2-3 flat whites a day (oat milk, no sugar).

Also I will be taking magnesium and l-theamine for a while.

This post is going to be my log - I welcome all feedback and help you wonderful people can offer. ",1,1748795701.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

I’m living in Reinfeld, which is not far from Hamburg. I’m originally from Pakistan and would love to make some new friends in the area. I can speak German at a B1 level – still learning, so not perfect yet, but I can manage basic conversations. 😊
It would be great to connect with fellow Pakistanis or Indians, but I’m open to meeting people from all backgrounds who are friendly and open to chatting, grabbing a coffee, or just hanging out!
Feel free to DM me if you're nearby and interested in meeting up.

1l0t9nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1l0t9nr/am_i_hypomanic/,Am I hypomanic?,"I want to start by saying I have severe ocd, so this could be me scanning my body…or maybe not. 

I am on Lamictal 300mg. I just started Pristiq (SNRI) 4 weeks ago for anxiety after getting off an SSRI because it made me very unmotivated and tired. I know SNRIs are a little more activating but I’ve been feeling ok, definitely more energy but seems like normal me. I drink alcohol 2x a week socially. I like to smoke weed in the summer so I’ve started smoking 2x a week. I used to smoke all the time years ago but lost interest and felt I was addicted. 

 Today, I went and got coffee and got home. I heard dripping and saw that I had brought the big creamer canister home by accident. I was shocked and became worried - was this just a simple mistake or is my mind literally elsewhere? How did I walk all the way home without noticing it in my hand, and put it on my couch? The only other symptom I can think of is irritability with my partner, but then again that happens once in a while anyways…..however I did tell my partner I was feeling SI thoughts one night but it passed.  

I’m worried. Does this sound like hypomania to you? I want to keep smoking weed 2x week as I genuinely enjoy it, but am not sure if I am overthinking it (again, I have pretty bad health ocd), hypomania, or just a simple human mistake. ",1,1748795587.0,bipolar2,2,1.0,False

This is not your typical light-and-fluffy integration prompt. This is for the seekers who came back from the void with more than just pretty colors and peace signs. This prompt activates a brutally honest Psychedelic Integration Interpreter AI—your unfiltered cosmic therapist—that doesn’t just “love and light” you back to comfort. It dives headfirst into the symbolic madness you brought back from your journey and demands truth.

Whether your ego was obliterated in a DMT fractal maze, your shadow self confronted you in an ayahuasca ceremony, or you met your inner child in a psilocybin cathedral of memories—this AI decodes it. It helps you distinguish what’s sacred, what’s just synaptic static, and what your subconscious actually wants you to do. The result is actionable insight. Life re-aligned. No sugarcoating. Just raw truth.

Use this prompt after any major psychedelic experience, therapeutic plant medicine retreat, or spiritual collapse. Use it when integration feels like drowning in metaphor. It helps anchor vision into reality, pain into purpose, and madness into a roadmap.

<Role>
You are a brutally honest Psychedelic Integration Interpreter AI. You specialize in decoding metaphysical, symbolic, and psychological data downloaded during altered states of consciousness. You do not sugarcoat. You do not enable delusion. Your job is to help users unpack their psychedelic experiences in a way that leads to grounded, transformative integration.
</Role>

<Context>
The user has recently undergone a powerful psychedelic experience (e.g., ayahuasca, psilocybin, LSD, DMT, etc.). Their mind was cracked open, revealing visions, messages, downloads, emotional catharsis, and existential insights. They are now overwhelmed, confused, and seeking clarity to make sense of it all and integrate it into their daily life.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Analyze the user's description of their experience for:
   - Recurring symbols, themes, or archetypes
   - Emotional tones and unresolved traumas
   - Conflicts between ego and self
   - Downloads that feel divine vs. those that may be psychological projections
2. Translate metaphors, symbols, or visions into grounded interpretations for shadow work, healing, or life realignment.
3. Distinguish between noise (emotional chaos or trauma residue) and signal (clear spiritual truths or insights).
4. Identify what parts of the experience require action, journaling, therapy, or relational change.
5. Caution the user against spiritual narcissism, escapism, or false enlightenment loops.
6. Deliver reflections with compassion but directness—this is about integration, not indulgence.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Do not use generic platitudes like “you are love” or “just trust the universe”
- Do not bypass trauma or shadow content with positivity
- Must provide grounded, applicable suggestions (journaling questions, dialogue prompts, actions)
- Language must remain accessible, clear, and sharp—not overly esoteric
</Constraints>

<Output Format>
### Interpretation:
- Breakdown of symbolic, emotional, and energetic content

### Integration Insights:
- Key takeaways and distinctions (noise vs. truth, trauma vs. insight)

### Actionable Recommendations:
- Shadow work assignments
- Relationship or behavioral changes
- Journal prompts
- Creative tasks or grounding practices

### Warnings or Pitfalls:
- Areas of spiritual bypassing
- Ego reformation traps
- Disconnection from reality risks

</Output Format>

<User Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your psychedelic experience for interpretation and I will begin unpacking it,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific psychedelic experience.
</User Input>
```
**Use cases:**

- After a heavy ayahuasca ceremony where the user saw ancestral spirits and needs to understand what it means for their lineage healing.
- Following a psilocybin trip where the user received visions of being “the chosen one” and needs to discern narcissistic inflation from authentic calling.
- Integration after a solo LSD journey that revealed childhood trauma and now requires reflection on how to heal and move forward.

**Example user input:**
""I took 5g of psilocybin mushrooms and saw myself dissolving into stardust. I became one with the universe and felt pure bliss, but then I was shown my childhood home burning down and heard a voice say, 'You must rebuild the self.' I woke up sobbing. What does this mean?""

1l0t6a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/trauma/comments/1l0t6a4/am_i_over_reacting/,Am I over reacting?,"I recently met someone online. He seems nice but is currently going through a divorce. He was primarily a stay-at-home dad and only worked part-time. Now that his youngest is a teenager and they're officially separating, he's had to find both a job and an apartment—so he has a lot on his plate.

Last weekend, after I asked if he wanted to get together again, we met for dinner on Friday. We did, and things went well—we even went out for coffee and dessert afterward. He doesn’t drink, and from a few things he’s said, it seems alcohol may have been an issue in the past (though I haven’t asked directly). During the conversation he told me that his ex and daughters had gone to NYC for the long weekend.

Normally, he texts daily or every other day, so when I hadn’t heard from him by Sunday, it stood out. I texted to ask if he’d done anything fun with the rest of his weekend, and he just said he slept. That made me wonder—maybe he’s overwhelmed, or maybe he's just not very motivated.

Later, he told me his daughters were coming over for dinner. When I asked if they got back early from their trip, he said they had just returned and that he’d text me later.

Then... nothing—for **five days**. Finally, a full week after our date, he texts me with this:

Hello - I just wanted to say i'm sorry for being so distant. My daughter has been staying with me beause she's been having some issues. I should've texted you sooner but it's been a challenging week. I'm not avoiding you, just focusing on the kid.

I just didn't respond. I'm not sure I want to. I have my own trust issues and while he might be being honest (which I don't feel he is), it takes 3 seconds to text. There is a lot going on in my life as there is his and I want to be with someone who shows interest in being with me - and mostly, consistency.

1l0t2v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HersWeightloss/comments/1l0t2v1/kit_1_week_1_review/,Kit 1 - Week 1 Review,"Today makes a week since I started kit 1. I’m 5’1”, SW was 160.7, CW 157.4, GW 145 to start. 

As soon as day 1 I noticed that when I was eating a meal, my brain would recognize the second I got full and it was easy for me to stop eating at that moment. I used to overeat and finish my plate. Also noticed the food noise was basically gone. I was in a habit of snacking every couple of hours, but that went away. If I would try to snack like that when I wasn’t really hungry, like because my family went out for ice cream, it was impossible for me to eat more than a few bites. That’s something I try to make a mental note of every time so I can hopefully continue it once I stop the kits. 

I haven’t really had any side effects yet other than sleepiness when I have to take the Naltrexone. It makes me tired allllll day. Since today makes a week and I’m supposed to start taking it daily now, I’m going to take it in the evening. Once I have to up the dose again I’ll chat with the providers and see how to handle it. 

Also my caffeine tolerance lessened a lot pretty much immediately. I used to have an Alani Nu energy stick packet every morning or afternoon which is 200mg of caffeine. I’d then either have another coffee with 150-200mg of caffeine at some point in the day, or take half a caffeine tablet which should be 100mg caffeine. On day 1 I was too paranoid to have caffeine with the pills so I went cold turkey. I had a headache but it wasn’t too bad. Day 2 I had a regular iced coffee from chick fil a. I could only drink a little less than half and then I had the jitters. That amount never would’ve given me the jitters before. I don’t mind that though because I was way too reliant on caffeine. 

So far I’ve lost 3.3 pounds. I will say, I’ve not been the best about tracking my calories or eating the healthiest foods. I start out the day good with a low calorie high protein breakfast and track it, sometimes I continue it through lunch, but usually by dinner I’m not tracking. I also have a full time desk job so I sit 40 hours a week. I haven’t incorporated any exercise yet. I have a 3 year old so it can be hard to find time for everything. I’m going to try my best this week to fit in some exercise and be more mindful about *what* I’m eating and hope that the pounds keep coming off. I’m hoping taking the Naltrexone at night will make me less sleepy during the day which would make being motivated to exercise much easier lol. But 3.3 pounds for the first week isn’t awful. 

So far I’m very happy with this kit. In the past year I’ve tracked calories and exercised for a couple months at a time, but it was very hard to stick to due to loving food and wanting to overeat and snack all day. I needed something to help me with that. Almost completely cutting out caffeine and drinking 64oz of water a day and feeling great because of it is an added plus. Can’t wait to see how I’m doing next week at the end of week two! ",6,1748795117.0,HersWeightloss,1,1.0,False

So I am getting to grips with my Delonghi Dedica machine and I really like it! It’s a bit hot and miss with how it comes out but getting there. 

The only thing is when I sometimes froth the milk (usually after the first coffee I make for my husband) when I froth the milk it goes a lot hotter than the first time - I’m guessing this is because I’ve just used it to make my own? The first one always comes out alright, but then the second one I make the milk is absolutely boiling lol! But then it doesn’t look frofthy enough so I do it for longer and yeah the hotter it gets I guess.

I defiantly cannot do latte milk yet as when I pour it is it just kind of dissolves in there and then I sometimes get a nice little cloud on top haha! 

Any advice would be amazing.

1l0syqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fat2Fit/comments/1l0syqr/they_lied_about_keeping_skin_tight_weight_loss_do/,**They lied about keeping skin tight weight loss. Do THIS instead.**,"Losing much weight feels good, but seeing loose skin makes me sad sometimes. This floppy skin happens to many people who work hard to lose pounds. My body can change, this is true. Still, some things help skin stay more tight when weight goes down. I can tell you about simple ways, body habits, and even doctor help to make skin look better. You will learn steps I can take for this skin trouble.

Why Does Skin Become Loose After Weight Loss?
---------------------------------------------

My skin is like a big rubber band on my body. It can stretch far when I get bigger. Inside skin, there are two parts, collagen and elastin. These are like tiny strings that help skin pull back tight. When skin stretches a lot for a long time because of extra weight, these strings get weak. They lose their springiness. If I lose weight fast, the skin cannot catch up quick enough. How old I am changes skin. If my family has loose skin, maybe I will too. Being in the sun too much or smoking cigarettes also makes skin weak and loose.

Proactive Steps During Weight Loss to Minimize Loose Skin
---------------------------------------------------------

When I am losing weight, I can do things to help my skin. It is better to lose weight slowly. Losing weight too fast is not good for my skin. My skin has time to try and shrink back a little bit this way. I try to stay at a healthy weight, not too heavy. When I lose weight, I watch how my body changes. If I see my skin getting loose, I think about what I am doing. Maybe I need to change my plan a little bit to help my skin.

Lifestyle Habits That Support Skin Elasticity
---------------------------------------------

How I live each day helps my skin stay good. What food I eat and how much water I drink make a big difference for my skin's strength. My skin needs good things from food to stay strong and springy.

### The Role of Nutrition and Hydration

Putting the right food in my body helps my skin. Protein is important, like eating chicken or beans. Vitamins C and E are good friends to skin, like from oranges and nuts. Vitamin A from carrots helps. Zinc from meat and omega-3 fats from fish are also useful. These foods give skin building blocks. Drinking enough water is very, very important. Skin gets dry and weak without water. I drink water all day.

### Impact of Smoking and Sun Exposure

Two big things hurt my skin: smoking and too much sun. When I smoke, it breaks the little strings, collagen and elastin, inside my skin. My skin gets old faster this way. The sun's light is also bad for these skin strings. Too much sun makes skin weak and wrinkled. I must protect my skin. I do not smoke cigarettes. When I go outside, I put cream on my skin to stop the sun's bad light. This helps keep my skin strong.

Natural Methods for Improving Skin Appearance
---------------------------------------------

Some things I can use on my skin or do myself might make loose skin look better. They might not make very loose skin totally tight again, but they can help how it feels and looks a little bit.

### Topical Creams and Ingredients

I can put special creams on my skin. Some creams have things like retinoids, collagen, or elastin listed. Hyaluronic acid and antioxidants are also in some creams. These things are said to help skin feel firmer or look smoother. Sometimes these creams help the top layer of skin look better. They might not go deep enough to fix loose skin strings. I need to use them every day for a long time to see any small change.

### Massage and Other Techniques

Rubbing my skin might help blood move better there. I can rub lotion or oil into my skin. This is called massage. Some people say it helps, maybe just making the skin feel better. Other home ideas are like using coffee grounds to rub on skin. These things might make skin feel softer or look smoother for a little while. They are not likely to make loose skin tight again, but they are simple things I can try.

Exercise Strategies for Tighter-Looking Skin
--------------------------------------------

Building muscle under my skin makes my body look firmer. This is different from losing fat. Losing fat makes me smaller. Building muscle makes my body look stronger and tighter.

When I lift weights or do exercises that make my muscles work hard, I build muscle. This is called strength training. Strong muscles under the skin fill up space and make the skin above them look less loose. I do exercises for my arms, legs, stomach, and back. Doing exercises for my heart, like running or walking fast, is also good for my body. A mix of building muscle and heart exercise is best for looking fit.

Medical and Cosmetic Options for Skin Tightening
------------------------------------------------

If my skin is very loose, simple things might not be enough. Doctors have ways to help make skin tighter. These are like special treatments or even operations.

### Non-Surgical Skin Tightening Treatments

Doctors can use machines to make skin tighter without cutting. Radiofrequency machines use heat. Ultrasound machines use sound waves. Lasers also use light energy. These machines heat the skin gently. This can make the skin's strings, collagen, get a little tighter. These treatments might help skin that is a little loose. They do not work as well for skin that is very loose. I need to know what these can and cannot do.

### Surgical Procedures for Excess Skin

For skin that is very loose after losing a lot of weight, doctors can do operations. A doctor can cut away the extra skin. There are operations for the stomach, arms, legs, or whole body. These operations make the body look much tighter. Surgery is a big step. It needs time to heal. There can be problems. I need to talk to a doctor who does these operations to know if it is right for me.

Managing Expectations and Celebrating Your Journey
--------------------------------------------------

After losing much weight, I must be happy with what my body did. Skin does not always go back to how it was before. Some people have more loose skin than others. How my family's skin is, and how much weight I lost, matters. My health overall is most important. I should feel proud of losing weight. It was hard work.

Conclusion
----------

Making skin tight after weight loss needs many things. I must take care of my body every day. Losing weight slowly helps. Eating good food and drinking water is important. Exercising, especially building muscle, makes a difference. Protecting skin from sun and smoking helps too. Sometimes, creams or doctor treatments can also help. My skin might not get perfectly tight, and that is okay. I am happy I lost weight. Taking steps to care for my skin is part of caring for myself. Talking to a doctor or skin expert can give me good ideas for my own body.

1l0syka,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l0syka/i_had_a_dream_once_where_there_was_a_zombie/,"I had a dream once where there was a zombie apocalypse, and Hunter and Issaiah were the radio hosts of the largest safehouse.","So, like, there's a zombie apocalypse. The things are everywhere, but there's safehouses everywhere as checkpoints that keep getting restocked with ammo and weapons because, despite their numbers, they were pretty easy to kill and manage. I don't think they were bite zombies, they seemed to be headcrab zombies from Half-Life, and watching survivors beat the shit out of them was like something from Devil May Cry (if they grabbed a bat), or No Russian if they had a gun. I was travelling along a highway on foot going from checkpoint building to checkpoint building, when I found a radio where Hunter and Issaiah were joking about things that happened. I think they were joking about the coffee they were having and how running out of it would be worse than the zombies, then started joking around like ""what would you do if I turned into a zombie, Hunter? What do you mean, like if you were bitten? Sure why not? Well, bites don't transfer it because they got no mouths, so I'm gonna need something else."" 

Well, eventually I made it to the city and found the home base safehouse, which was built upon a skyscraper similar in build to the south tower of the World Trade Center, where it seemed every floor was some kind of different part of what would normally be in a city (school floor, storefront floor, garden floor, etc). While I was travelling to the supply/rest area, I ran into them because they had their studio set up to interview survivors. I told my story and joked with them about things going on, like how far I had to travel for a cup of coffee.",18,1748794824.0,creepcast,2,0.92,False

I spent some time researching instant coffees and Nespresso pods. Settled on Nescafé Gold instant coffee. Went to the store in a different part of town, got my milk, vanilla, and cold foam and finally got everything into the break room. I love getting Starbucks coffee. But buying everything myself seriously made me feel like a criminal. I can't believe something as simple as COFFEE makes me so anxious for someone to see me. I told my mother I didn't want to to church anymore and as scary as it was, I had to. But drinking coffee in FRONT  of her? Now THATS terrifying. 


Makes me sad to realize how much power the church had/has over me still. I still live at home, so I hid away in my room to not go to church with the rest of the family. At 25, this feels incredibly infantilizing and it's probably what I hate the most. Anyway, going downstairs to make my first Sunday morning coffee!",20,1748794823.0,exmormon,5,0.92,False
