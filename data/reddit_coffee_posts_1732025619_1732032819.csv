1gv0qt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1gv0qt8/im_happy_but_also_not/,"I’m happy, but also not. ","I’ve been experiencing a weird range of emotions this past year. I wanted to confide in my boyfriend about this but I don’t want to burden him with my feelings more than I already do (I’m an extremely emotional person lol). 

I’m 23 and I moved to Wyoming from California to be with my boyfriend as we had been in a long distance relationship for a couple years and it’s been bumpy. Nothing crazy I just had a hard time finding a good job and trying to fit in with his family. 

It’s been a year since my move, I finally found a good job around 5 or 6 months ago. My job is extremely boring because I’m a bank teller at a local bank and there’s not much foot traffic, but the pay and benefits are good. I like my coworkers as well but there’s a rather large age gap between me and everyone else. 

I LOVE living here, being around the mountains and so much nature. I moved to a small town so it’s a slower pace of life which is great. I love living with my boyfriend, our relationship has been fantastic for the most part since I moved. 

I think I could be lonely, I only have one girl friend who’s my boyfriends sister in law. I don’t really do much during the week besides work, go home, cook dinner, and go to sleep. Before I moved I was in college but definitely burned out, so I’ve taken the time since then to think about what I actually want to do. I feel stagnant and unfulfilled. Since I moved I definitely drink too much which scares me because my dad is an alcoholic and I don’t want to go down that path. I don’t drink on weekdays but on weekends I go overboard and feel guilty about it, like I’m doing something wrong. 

I have found that I’ve been using alcohol as a crutch to numb these feelings of discomfort and it’s hard for me to stop. As well as alcohol I smoke weed, which I do on weekdays before bed so I sleep better. I started to feel guilty about that as well. It’s not hurting anyone and it’s doesn’t get in the way of my daily responsibilities, I think I’m just focusing on everything I’m not doing with my life that I could be. 

I think about moving back to California to be around my family a lot. For a moment it makes me happy to think about it, but I don’t want to quit on my life here. I don’t know if it’s my job, lack of college, or just depression that’s making me unhappy when I feel like I should be happy. 

Before I worked at this bank I worked at a donut shop, which was HORRIBLE. In California I was a barista and I loved doing that. I think about finding a job at one of the local coffee shops a lot but the pay is not as good, usually no benefits, and it has way less room for advancement. 

I just don’t know what to do, I find myself constantly criticizing myself for not putting myself out there to make my own friends and find things that make me happy on a day to day basis. I’m very introverted and quiet so it seems like a daunting task. On top of everything else, I gained 20 pounds last winter and haven’t been able to shake it so I’m at the biggest I’ve ever been. Not obese by any means but definitely overweight and it makes me want to hide myself away because I feel so gross. 

I know all of this can be fixed rather easily but it feels so impossible for me. 

Anyway, if anyone has any advice or has a similar experience I’d love to hear about it. ",1,1732032590.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

People still need to speak in those situations to order a book or coffee. People are moving around you, shuffling, the coffee machines make noise, it’s not actually quite just an acceptable amount of noise for most people to focus on work. Not to mention there’s always events at libraries where people bring their screaming children and Karen’s are bound to go to coffee shops and start screaming at the baristas. 

I mean actual individual rooms where if someone is about to go insane from the noise of the world they can pay someone to use these rooms and not hear a single noise from outside. 

People I live with are unable to be quiet from 6am to 11pm when they’ve finally tuckered out from making noise all day long non stop. I go outside to get away with it but always afraid I’m going to get in trouble for loitering because I don’t want to be around people, just sit in my car in silence for a few hours.

*Vilantia Prime, estate of Great Lord Aa'Porti*

The Great Lord sat in his office, surrounded by tablets all glowing in different shades. Finally he selected one and tapped on it. The image that displayed was simply a logo of a Terran animal that was mostly black, with a white belly and two white stripes along the back.

It took a few moments for the link to establish, and the logo began to move its mouth in time with the words being spoken. ""SkunkWorks Insurance, Smith."" The voice was entirely artificial, and there were no scent-markers transmitted with the words.

""Smith, this is your policy-holder Laika. I have news. I received an offer that cannot be declined, which requires us to alter our policy.""

""Well, that's a damn shame. I was looking forward to spending your retainer in New Vegas. Little bird told me the Lucky 38's opening up again, straight tables with their own hydroponic system so they can make and distill fifty types of booze."" There was a sigh. ""So what's this alteration you're talking about?""

""As part of the new peace agreements, I will be creating a new organization owned by private citizens. The Vilantian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative will be paying the premiums moving forward.""

""Fair enough. Anything else?""

""I should like for the Trade Cooperative to open a new policy."" Great Lord Aa'Porti growled out the rest of it. ""The Trade Cooperative would like a full review of the recent action involving the mercenary company Bravo Bulldogs. They were supposed to exit R-space at a specific time, and did not. This goes against what is known of their tactical doctrine manuals. Explain.""

""Oh, that's an easy one. They don't follow the manuals all the time.""

""That is nonsensical.""

""The Bulldogs and their parent company 7th Cav came from...well, I'll skip the history lesson for now – suffice to say that there's a section in their manual that advises if the tactical situation calls for it, the manual can be ignored and the commander on scene can act as they see fit.""

""Then how can they know what to do?"" Aa'porti was thoroughly confused by this new information. ""The individual soldiers would be completely at a loss.""

""Not really. Their doctrine teaches initiative, independence of thought and action – as long as the objective is completed and no interstellar laws are broken doing so the general response is to record what was done and teach it later.""

""They teach their soldiers to break the rules?""

""If the situation calls for it.""

""Ridiculous.""

""Terran."" That one word seemed to be their fallback for any event that made absolutely no sense.

There was exasperation in Aa'portis' voice. ""In any event, I would like to know how they think and act, so that I -"" he caught himself ""- so that the Trade Cooperative may best utilize their talents in the future.""

""Well, I'll give you one for free; there's a new company being formed under the 7th Cav calling itself the Terran Foreign Legion. Looks like they got that one fella who was an observer on that last mission in charge, and they picked up some folks from a Vilantian warfreighter called the *Hidepiercer* and a Hurdop ship called the *Godsfang* docked at 7th Cav HQ a little bit ago. Do with that what you will, but a smart fellah would make a friend on the inside there. Soon as he didn't need to ice his balls every hour.""

Lord Aa'porti kept his voice tightly held. ""I will take that information under consideration. Laika out.""

The communication channel closed, and Lord Aa'porti leaned back in his chair. He'd overcome obstacles and failure before, and this latest setback seemed to be almost providence at the end of it all. As Minister of Trade, he had exceptional leeway in working with the planetary industries. Those who became his friends would be granted leeway. Those who did not would need other friends. Atop that, this Foreign Legion could be his test garden for determining how to merge the governments of Vilantia, Hurdop and Terra into a united confederation of planets, with his paw guiding them all.

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

 

Gryzzk sat in his office in the *Twilight Rose* rubbing his head. The ship itself was still in the process of being torn down and rebuilt, but the additions to the superstructure had been completed and the path to the bridge was clear. His office and ship-quarters were immediately to the right of the bridge entrance, with his ready room mirroring the office but placed to the left. He'd been able to decorate his office to his satisfaction, with stills and shortvids of Grezzk and the children along with various personal scent dispensers. His eyes lingered on what was quickly becoming his favorite – Nhoot clutching Rhipl'i and wearing his beret which was comically oversized on her, while Gro'zel wore his dress jacket draped over her shoulders and did her utmost to give ""Private Nhoot and Private Rhipl'i"" orders to clean, which was immediately followed by the same scene with the roles reversed. Unfortunately such camaraderie was not displayed by his company at large.

The period of unity he'd hoped for had lasted almost two days into the training, and now at five days into their initial meeting the company had almost fully split along the ancient lines. It was disheartening on several levels. To be fair, this was a great challenge he'd accepted, essentially binding three very disparate cultures together.

He'd fallen into the habit of taking breakfast with his officers and lunch with his sergeants, and they'd all reported similar things. Insults, not-so-hidden jabs in the meal lines, and general disruption of activity were becoming the norm between the Vilantians and Hurdop. It was beyond the normal matches of dominance and place-finding that was normal for a new situation. The sergeants were reporting having to assign pushups along with various other exercise-based punishments more often and in greater numbers. He knew how to lead Vilantians. He could function with the Terrans. The Hurdop were the great unknown.

It was possible that his presence was not helpful in all aspects. He'd been taking lessons and study sessions with the recruits, and while his combat prowess had increased dramatically, he was nowhere near the seasoned fighter that no few of his charges were. He often smelled tension in the room when he was taking in tactical courses with the Terran instructors, all of whom were preaching tactics and movements that were wholly out of line with the Clan Way. Concepts like situational awareness were easy for him to grasp, but for many of the recruits, it was difficult to understand. Perhaps his lack of knowledge in the war tactics of his species was in fact an advantage, as he'd only truly been exposed to the Terran way of thinking.

He'd spent one night deep in a frustrating study of ancient history. It had been thirty-three generations since the Great Civilization, when Vilantia had discovered the technology to reach space and had been approached to become a member of the spacefaring Collective. According to the texts he had read from Vilantian sources, the technology had been stolen by the Nameless of the time to leave Vilantia and make their way as a civilization of pirates and thieves, becoming the Hurdop. This in itself was a revelation that he'd never known – he berated himself for this before remembering that he'd never *needed* to know these things until now. The following revelation was no less taxing - the Collective had also granted membership to the Hurdop shortly thereafter. The fact that made no sense to Gryzzk at first and could only be explained by trickery and deceit, if the texts he had read were to be believed.

Sitting alone in his office, Gryzzk reflected on his studies, considering if the texts *could* be believed. That thought alone occupied him for so long that he failed to notice First Sergeant O'Brien with their lunch.

""Captain, I took the liberty of dismissing the sergeants to work with their platoons today. Frankly sir, they're struggling to keep a lid on it."" The unspoken ""it"" was the brewing conflict between the factions.

""Is there a section that *isn't* attempting to re-fight the war?"" Gryzzk immediately regretted snapping at his First Sergeant, but she seemed to take it in stride.

O'Brien considered as she ate. ""Engineering seems to be pretty quiet. Not sure if it's because Chief Tucker's got 'em all scared or if there's something about the engineering mindset that just doesn't care.""

""I believe we should have more discussion regarding this.""

""Agreed."" O'Brien tapped her rank insignia. ""Chief Tucker, please report to the Captains' ready room. Chief Tucker to the Captains' ready room."" She then stood up, sliding her empty tray to the recycling. ""It seemed more appropriate, sir.""

""Agreed, First Sergeant."" Gryzzk went across the hall to the ready room, which was a simple affair that consisted of several rows of soft chairs that faced forward, along with a small shelf and viewscreen for the presenter.

It took several minutes for Chief Warrant Officer Tucker to arrive. He'd obviously tried to stop and clean up, but his arms and forearms still bore marks of grease and grime. His salute wasn't quite a parody, but it certainly wasn't as crisp as most others. His rank indicator – a single vertical gold bar with a thin purple line down the middle – was askew and appeared to have been chipped at some point. While he was attentive to hygiene and his scent at the morning meetings was fresh, currently the pungent aromas of sweat and coffee surrounded him.

""S'up Cap?"" Tucker seemed to be genuinely curious about the summoning, and Gryzzk hoped he wasn't wasting anyone's' time on this.

""Chief, we have a situation and we'd like your input as how to resolve it.""

""So, not about the AI going in next week?""

""No, something different. I've been receiving reports from all the other sections, and there is noted friction between the Vilantian and Hurdop recruits. All except engineering. Could you explain why that is?""

Tucker blinked a few times thinking about it. ""Well, if I had to guess I'd say there's maybe a couple reasons. First an' foremost, physics doesn't care where you're from, it's gonna run the same everywhere. So everyone's got that commonality going for 'em. Most of what they disagree about's the how to get from point A to point B. But the R-space equation math is the same no matter who punches the numbers in."" Tucker shrugged casually.

""And the second?""

""Well, I guess you could call it an engineering quirk of y'all – curiosity. All the engineering schools in both Vilantian and Hurdop space have a heavy history requirement. I guess your early engineers were big on history and that kinda-sorta got passed down. So when they all got together there was about a half day of arguing about history and they got it together and figured out that history's written by the winners, and well, they both thought they won the thing the Vilantians call the Great Civilization and the Hurdop call the Freedom Flight."" There was another shrug. ""I guess nobody likes to think their ex is having a good time. Anyway, they put their histories together and kinda sorted out they were both about half-right. Took most of a day but I think the boys might be working on a joint history presentation that's gonna tweak everybody something fierce.""

Gryzzk was deep in thought at these revelations from the section. He hesitated for a moment before speaking. ""So...a group project and shared knowledge?""

""That's about the size of it."" Tucker nodded casually.

""Do you have any recommendations for how these things could be applied to the company at large?""

Tucker thought about it, apparently treating the question as an engineering problem. ""Well, I'm not sure if shared knowledge is a thing, but you do have some traditions that survived meeting the Collective and splitting up. Maybe have everyone duel it up or something. Group project, that's pretty wide possibilities."" His face made several odd expressions as he thought about it. ""So I heard you know about ship curry, yeah?""

Gryzzk winced slightly at the memory. ""I am...familiar.""

""Mebbe set up a contest or something. Everyone who can bang two pots together gets to make a curry dish, everyone gets a sample, best one by vote wins."" Tucker leaned against the wall for a moment

O'Brien nodded. ""I like the thought. I'll talk to the rest of the cadre and see what we're gonna need."" She paused. ""You guys got anything like rice on Vilantia?""

Gryzzk nodded. ""We do, but it is much denser and doesn't have the same scent. Mostly it's used as a grazing fodder.""

Tucker made a little chuckle. ""You're missing out. Anyway, you got my two cents and this seems to be going off track, so I'm out."" He flicked something resembling a salute to Gryzzk and left for his engineering space.

O'Brien snorted. ""Damn Warrant Officers. Mad bastards, the lot.""

""So it would seem. I don't suppose there's an area dedicated for physical combat?""

""Company area just got a sand pit put in for volleyball. We'll take the net down, set up a rack for pugil sticks and a couple helmets, anyone wants a go they can go.""

""Well enough. Assembly before evening meal?""

""Don't ask me Captain, I'm not in charge around here."" Which he'd learned was her way of saying he was asking a somewhat foolish question.

Gryzzk tapped his rank for the all-hands channel. ""All personnel, this is Captain Gryzzk. Report to the company area in"" he paused to check the time ""ninety minutes for a pair of announcements. Lieutenant Gregg-Adams, report to the Captains' ready room. That is all.""

Lieutenant Gregg-Adams was much faster to the ready room than Tucker had been. As Terrans went he wasn't exactly tall, with a receding brown hair and a slight pouch around his belly. He saluted rapidly and stood straight, with underlying nervousness at odds with his crisp scent. It was definitely an odd thing to experience after his conversation with the Chief.

""At ease, Lieutenant. I require some items prior to the assembly. Specifically, items for training in melee combat and the needed safety gear.""

""Pugil sticks, yessir.""

""Also, a good amount of rice to distribute to each individual room. We're going to be selecting the ships' curry in about a week, and I'd like everyone to have an opportunity to participate.""

Gregg-Adams seemed perplexed for a moment at the variety of items, finally nodding. ""Can do, sir.""

""You have questions?""

""No questions, sir.""

""Very well, dismissed.""

The lieutenant saluted again, spun sharply and jogged out of the ready room. As soon as he was out of range, the footsteps rapidly increased in timing, indicating that he'd broken into a run.

O'Brien shook her head. ""Poor wee lamb.""

""He did seem a bit concerned.""

""Aye, his first posting. Make sure he exercises – he's the type that'll spend three days awake studying for an exam and get winded three minutes into a proper -"" she caught herself before saying something impolite ""- run.""

""He does seem a bit academic.""

""That's one word for it. Anyway, I should go see to some things. Do set an alarm for yourself sir. It's bad form to be late to a meeting you've called.""

Gryzzks ears drooped slightly. Of all the things he'd lost along the way, it seemed his normally impeccable sense of time was in desperate need of an update. It was quite likely due to the change in day length – on the ship day and night blended to an extent, but here they held to a Terran standard day which was longer than Vilantias' by about six hours. On the one hand it meant that more could be accomplished, but on the other hand it meant for awkward meal times. Yet another thing for him to consider.

He kept himself busy with progress reports and studying for clues within them that might indicate which members of the company had been fighting. It seemed a study in careful wording which when cross-referenced with medical supplies requested by the company printers painted a grim picture.

The chime of his alarm set him in motion, as he left his office and began the climb up to the company area. He was able to arrive with the press of his fellows as they moved to proper formation. In the company area, he saw that several padded sticks had been placed along the wall outside the company day room, along with helmets and a few mouthguards. Each stick had a red and a blue side.

Gryzzk was pleased at the initial look of the company formation. His sergeants had done a good job with basic instruction, and the company was shaping up to be more than a mob thrown together by fate. As soon as he stood at his position, the lieutenants snapped straight, with the sergeants and enlisteds doing the same.

""Alpha Howlers, at ease."" Gryzzk began to slowly pace in front of the formation with his hands behind his back. ""I have been made aware of a disturbing trend over the past few days. A lack of cohesion. Lack of unity. Lack of focus. Some of you seem to think it is time to re-ignite a war that has just finished. I do not believe that is the intent, but that is the end result. That said, it is improper for me to expect all to place forehead to forehead and swear the clan-sibling oaths simply on my directive. With that in mind, there is now an avenue available to disagree physically and not fall to dishonor."" Gryzzk walked over to the pugil stick rack and selected one, and then secured a helmet and mouthguard before setting his tablet aside. He then walked over to the new sand pit and tested it. The footing was loose and he was slipping quite a bit. He might actually have a chance at this. ""With the assistance of First Sergeant O'Brien, we will demonstrate. Now, Vilantians and Hurdop have a tradition of duels, with the forms being specific. I will expect those forms to be adhered to. Based on what I have seen, there is a similar tradition among the Terrans.""

It was a tribute to the First Sergeant that she was unsurprised by being selected to assist in the demonstration, and she simply put on a helmet and selected a larger stick, after which she addressed the company.

""Alight, once you strap this on, you're in it. There's two ways to win. Knock 'em out or on points. Blue side is a half-point, red side's a full point. You leave the sand, your opponent gets a point. Three points ends the round, three rounds ends the match. After that, you shake hands, dust each other off, and get back to what you were doing. For demonstration purposes, we're only going one point. Scoreboard's gonna keep track.""

O'Brien put her mouth guard in, stepped into the pit, and Gryzzk rolled his shoulders to issue the Terran-style challenge – not exactly easy as the mouthguard was interfering. ""Are we gonna keep moving air, or are we gonna have a scrap?""

The First Sergeant snorted, muttering something about Laroy and quickly feinted forward before bringing the stick back. Gryzzk tucked and rolled to get out of the way of the painful-looking stick, only to catch a shot to his side.

A soft artificial voice intoned. ""Half-point, First Sergeant O'Brien.""

They reset themselves and nodded, beginning again. This time Gryzzk was slightly more prepared for the initial feint, ducking down and flinging a handful of sand at the First Sergeant before ducking under and catching the back of her legs with the blue side of his stick, bringing her down to a knee.

""Half-point, Captain Gryzzk.""

They both reset again, with a slight smile on both their faces. A nod from each of them and the fight was joined for the third time, with both of them circling each other cautiously. Gryzzk tried to feint as O'Brien had earlier and overbalanced slightly, which left an opening for O'Brien; the resulting smack to the back of his head left his vision clouded and ears ringing. He got up to his knees and nodded to O'Brien as she grabbed his shoulder and casually hauled him to his feet. He barely heard the artificial voice declaring the match over. There was a bit of a smile on O'Brien's face as she took off her helmet and returned her stick to its original place. Then as was the proper form, they shook hands and cleared the dirt from the uniform of their opponent before returning to their correct positions in the formation. Gryzzk looked and saw that the company was by turns surprised and confused. Gryzzk was the Captain, their Lord, and therefore the victory should have been his.

""Hopefully this demonstration has been educational for all. Despite rank, we are all equals in that area."" Gryzzk waved at the sand pit. ""This goes against the traditions of the Clan Way, but we are our own Clan. Our traditions will be different, because we will take the best of all traditions and make them ours."" He shook his head one time to clear the last of the fuzz from his vision. ""To that end, we will be taking on a tradition for the ship itself. Within the Terrans, it is tradition to create a specific dish called 'curry', which is only served one day a week. The general recipe will be sent to your individual tablets after the evening meal. We will be holding a contest for all company personnel who wish to participate. At the end of the fourth week, we will be judging the contest entries and selecting the best one from among the participants, who will kindly remain anonymous. The winning recipe will be forwarded to the ship mess for replication. May the living gods bless the winner.""

The company seemed intrigued by this prospect, with a whispered buzz emanating from the group. This seemed to be an important thing to the Terrans at least, and more than a few were sneaking looks at their tablets to see if they could find out more about this 'curry' the captain spoke of.

Gryzzk looked around a bit. It seemed that the company scent was altering in some way that he couldn't quite define, like a broth half-cooked. He was going to have to be patient and wait for the results.

""Company. Dismissed.""

He was not surprised to see a portion of the company head right to the sand pit.",1,1732032362.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1gv0ls8,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1gv0ls8/walkers_oscillators_and_selfie_queens_tales_from/,"Walkers, Oscillators, and Selfie Queens: Tales from a Bangalore Park","
An old man walks fast, he almost jogs. He wants to beat you. Probably makes him feel good when he drinks his filter coffee later. ""I did it. I beat that vain middle-aged lady who thinks she can walk. Hmph.""

An aunty oscillates like a pendulum that may fly off its hinges in the park gym. She is counterbalanced by another aunty, deep in thought about whether she, too, needs to oscillate, while, she’s complaining about her husband, who, perhaps, is also in the park… oscillating solo.

Then there's another corporate slave in his jeans—why is he working out in his jeans? Pray, tell me, what could be the reason someone would wear the most uncomfortable piece of clothing to widen their legs to 180 degrees and straighten them back? Maybe he wants ripped jeans, literally.

There's always one uncle with one foot on the pendulum solo-oscillating, while the other leg is on the ground. What crime has the other leg committed? Why can't it join the fun? God knows. Uncle knows. Maybe the pendulum knows too, but it won’t tell.

The watchman, proud of his multi-functional role, is giving gym training instructions to a new aunty. “Hold it for a while,” he says with the authority of a certified coach. 

Then there's a grandpa yelling on the phone. ""Don’t trust anyone!"" he says. ""Everyone’s a cheat!"" he says. And here I am, getting robbed of my peaceful evening by his rants. 

A couple clicks pictures in front of the trees, beside the bushes. What are they capturing? The greenery, the scenery, or the debauchery of their existence? 

And how can we forget the selfie queens? Armed with multi-filtered facades, clicking away to lure nibbas all night long. 

Oh, dear evening in the park. With its colorful characters, more vibrant than the birds on its trees. No matter how frenzied life gets, there’s always time to jog, oscillate, or yell into the void of a warm Bangalore evening.

Watching ads seemed like a small, almost silly way to earn money. But I decided to stick with it, telling myself, ""Why not see what this could add up to?""

For 183 days now, I watched nearly 24 ads a day like clockwork. Morning coffee? Ads. Lunch break? Ads. Waiting in line at the store? More ads. By this point, my total earnings came to just over $60—a modest amount, but one I was determined to turn into something memorable.

That money became the seed for an impromptu weekend road trip. I packed a bag, filled the tank, and hit the road with no set destination, just a map and a sense of adventure. I explored little towns, stopped at diners I’d never noticed before, and even found a beautiful hiking trail I’d never heard of.

The trip gave me a fresh perspective. It wasn’t extravagant, but it reminded me how rewarding it can be to make the most of what you have. Those few cents per ad didn’t just add up to $60—they added up to an experience I’ll never forget.",0,1732031917.0,AtlasEarthOfficial,2,0.5,False

Spectral Capital Group a leading innovator in decentralized cloud technology and advanced quantum ledger solutions outlines its vision for Spectral’s [Vogon DQLDB](https://www.spectralcapital.com/vogon) with Plato Data Intelligence's Bryan Feinberg.

https://preview.redd.it/1os717dxrv1e1.jpg?width=1746&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f60113289b6f1d4808d4a238f05ce92b089862d

**Bryan Feinberg:** Sean, I saw your post on X about Vogon DQLDB and its potential to transform financial systems. You mentioned the importance of human identity at the heart of commercial and capital markets. Can you explain what drives this vision

**Sean Michael Brehm:** At the heart of every market transaction is human identity—the sum of each individual’s daily contributions to the commercial world. This goes beyond financial exchanges; it’s about our choices, our interactions, and our values reflected in the economy. Our Vogon DQLDB is built with this central idea: each person's activity—whether buying, selling, or investing—is a piece of a larger narrative. By indexing these contributions using MSCI’s GICS standards, we categorize each transaction into primary, secondary, and tertiary subindustries, which provides a transparent, honest representation of our roles in the market. This kind of system gives people credit for the economic impact they bring.

**Bryan Feinberg:** So, if I understand correctly, Vogon DQLDB is like a giant record-keeper that recognizes each person’s economic actions—whether I buy coffee, invest, or sell a used phone—as meaningful contributions. It tags each action to specific industries, showing that each of us is part of the economic story. Does that mean we’d all have a role in the markets beyond just being consumers Am I understanding that right, Sean

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Each transaction you make isn’t just about the money; it’s about showing your unique place and contribution in the economy regardless if you are in Boston or Botswana. By tagging actions to sub industries, we’re essentially writing a story where every participant is an author, making the market more inclusive and giving a clear picture of everyone’s impact. You’re not just a consumer; you’re a contributor to the system’s transparency and stability. Today your data is sold to others that do that and you don’t get any of the credit.  Moving forward you remain the custodian of your data, meaning you control how it’s accessed and used within the system.

**Bryan Feinberg:** You mentioned that this indexing could make Vogon DQLDB a modern version of the Buttonwood Agreement, returning transparency to the markets. How does that transparency affect market stability and honesty

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Our team is passionate about returning global markets to the transparency that the Buttonwood Agreement symbolized back in 1792. Back then, agreements were based on mutual accountability and a shared framework. By indexing each person’s contributions and categorizing transactions transparently, Vogon DQLDB restores a sense of trust. It shows how individual contributions make up the foundation of commercial and capital markets. This visibility helps create a more stable system, where people know their daily actions, large or small, are recorded and valued. It’s a fundamental shift back to the ethos of fair and open markets.

**Bryan Feinberg:** This sounds like a fair trade simplification engine where people could see the full picture, with everyone’s contributions kept out in the open, so it’s clear how they matter. Would this make it harder for anyone to ‘game’ the system

**Sean Michael Brehm:** It is all about fair trade and putting the human identity where it belongs: At the center of commercial and capital markets. Just like in the original Buttonwood Agreement, people would understand how their actions impact the system and trust that they’re being accounted for honestly. By making everything visible, we’re closing loopholes that might allow manipulations, making it easier for everyone to see the real, fair value of their contributions. Additionally, Vogon DQLDB employs advanced data encryption to protect individual data, so each person’s data is secure while remaining visible for regulatory and systemic oversight.

**Bryan Feinberg:** Indexing transactions with the GICS standards is an innovative idea. Can you explain how this process works within DQLDB

**Sean Michael Brehm:** When someone makes a transaction, Vogon DQLDB automatically categorizes it according to MSCI’s GICS standards, tagging it to a primary, secondary, and tertiary subindustry. This indexing means that every action—sale, investment, or trade—gets transparently attributed within the market. DQLDB essentially creates a ledger transaction and a transparent, user-owned database organized as coalitions, where the impact of each transaction is visible and accountable. Individuals maintain custodianship over their data, meaning they can access, review, and even limit how this data is used in certain contexts. Their identity is protected by post quantum cryptography. This way, we see exactly where your human effort drives the market and how industries connect to individual and collective activity. It’s a level of granularity in understanding our economic footprint that’s never been possible before and because you remain anonymous, it drives the value of your data up further.

**Bryan Feinberg:** If I buy something, the system tags that purchase based on what industry it falls into—like ‘Food and Drink’ if I buy lunch or ‘Tech’ if I buy a laptop. By tracking all my activities this way, DQLDB builds a clear picture of which industries are thriving or struggling based on my actions. Would it be like a mirror reflecting where I am putting all my money and time

**Sean Michael Brehm:** It’s exactly that—a mirror reflecting our individual and collective choices that drive the economy. It provides an accurate picture of which industries matter most based on individual actions. Plus, it helps both individuals and businesses make informed choices by showing how their economic footprint interacts with market trends.

**Bryan Feinberg:** You’ve talked about Vogon DQLDB supporting regulatory compliance. How does this focus on human identity and transaction visibility play out for financial oversight

**Sean Michael Brehm:** With Vogon DQLDB, regulators get a transparent, unbiased view of the market’s structure, right down to individual contributions. Each transaction reflects an identity within its industry, showing patterns that could reveal stability or potential risks. For example, if regulators notice a concentration of activity in specific sectors or a sudden shift in consumer behavior, they can respond proactively. This visibility helps create honest markets where contributions aren’t hidden or obscured but instead provide a stable foundation for economic oversight. We’re also in discussions with financial regulatory bodies to align our approach with industry standards, ensuring Vogon DQLDB can meet compliance requirements globally. It’s about building a fairer market system that operates with each participant's best interests in mind.

**Bryan Feinberg:** The DQLDB essentially lets regulators ‘see’ the entire market more clearly—like a map that shows where all the action is happening and helps them spot risky trends early on. How does this make it easier to keep the market stable and safe for everyone

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Now, with the Vogon DQLDB, regulators have a map to follow the action across sectors and industries in real time. They can react faster to shifts, and this creates a stable environment where everyone’s interests are protected. By enhancing transparency, we’re also limiting opportunities for shady practices to slip through the cracks.

**Bryan Feinberg:** Your post also touched on high-frequency transactions. How does the Vogon DQLDB balance technical efficiency with personal, transparent data representation

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Vogon is designed for both speed and integrity. With our epoch-based structuring and VMerkelPairs, it handles high-frequency data while preserving each transaction’s unique identity. Every data entry in the ledger-database is preserved with its industry attribution, creating a clear, real-time trail of our daily economic footprint. This is essential for creating an open, honest system where people see how their actions contribute to the broader economy. Vogon DQLDB doesn’t just record transactions—it reflects them back as part of a shared economic narrative, helping people feel involved while also using energy-efficient processes that reduce its carbon footprint. This way, we support both high transaction speeds and environmental responsibility.

**Bryan Feinberg:** So, the technology is fast enough to handle lots of transactions per second, but it doesn’t lose track of what each transaction actually represents. Is it fair to say that, even though the system processes everything at high speed, it still keeps a ‘personal touch’ by showing the meaning behind each transaction and keeping it secure

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Even though it’s fast, DQLDB is about showing how each one of your transactions—or organizational transactions—fits into the bigger picture. It does so security. Every action is recorded in a way that preserves its importance, so we see not just numbers but the real, human impact behind them and how businesses and governments use them responsibly.

**Bryan Feinberg:** Hearing about this focus on human identity, how do you see Vogon DQLDB impacting financial interactions for everyday people

**Sean Michael Brehm:** At Spectral Capital, we believe it represents a shift from seeing markets as abstract entities to understanding them as a community of individual identities and choices. For the first time, people can see themselves in the market, with their transactions categorized transparently and their contributions valued. This return to transparency and inclusivity builds trust, making financial systems more accessible and relatable. Imagine a world where each person knows their economic role and sees their efforts contributing to market stability. We’re also launching pilot programs in the retail and banking sectors to illustrate this vision, making the market feel less distant and helping people see how their choices influence the system.

**Bryan Feinberg:** I guess another way to look at this is that Vogon DQLDB will help people feel like they really matter in the financial system. Instead of the market being this distant, mysterious thing, we’d all see our own impact, and it would help us feel more involved.

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Yes, don’t you think that the market should reflect each of us, not feel like a faceless machine Instead of your mobile phone data going to large institutions, it remains yours on the Vogon DQLDB brings and it brings your contributions front and center, making people feel connected and giving everyone a meaningful stake in a fair, stable financial future.

**Bryan Feinberg:** Thank you, Sean. This vision of a human-centered market system is both powerful and timely. We look forward to seeing how Vogon DQLDB brings this vision to life.

This way, we support both high transaction speeds and environmental responsibility.

**Bryan Feinberg:** So, the technology is fast enough to handle lots of transactions per second, but it doesn’t lose track of what each transaction actually represents. Is it fair to say that, even though the system processes everything at high speed, it still keeps a ‘personal touch’ by showing the meaning behind each transaction and keeping it secure

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Even though it’s fast, DQLDB is about showing how each one of your transactions—or organizational transactions—fits into the bigger picture. It does so security. Every action is recorded in a way that preserves its importance, so we see not just numbers but the real, human impact behind them and how businesses and governments use them responsibly.

**Bryan Feinberg:** Hearing about this focus on human identity, how do you see Vogon DQLDB impacting financial interactions for everyday people

**Sean Michael Brehm:** At Spectral Capital, we believe it represents a shift from seeing markets as abstract entities to understanding them as a community of individual identities and choices. For the first time, people can see themselves in the market, with their transactions categorized transparently and their contributions valued. This return to transparency and inclusivity builds trust, making financial systems more accessible and relatable. Imagine a world where each person knows their economic role and sees their efforts contributing to market stability. We’re also launching pilot programs in the retail and banking sectors to illustrate this vision, making the market feel less distant and helping people see how their choices influence the system.

**Bryan Feinberg:** I guess another way to look at this is that Vogon DQLDB will help people feel like they really matter in the financial system. Instead of the market being this distant, mysterious thing, we’d all see our own impact, and it would help us feel more involved.

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Yes, don’t you think that the market should reflect each of us, not feel like a faceless machine Instead of your mobile phone data going to large institutions, it remains yours on the Vogon DQLDB brings and it brings your contributions front and center, making people feel connected and giving everyone a meaningful stake in a fair, stable financial future.

**Bryan Feinberg:** Thank you, Sean. This vision of a human-centered market system is both powerful and timely. We look forward to seeing how Vogon DQLDB brings this vision to life.

**Video:** [**https://youtu.be/h3KT4NQ04Dk**](https://youtu.be/h3KT4NQ04Dk)

**Direct Transcript:** 

So it's been a little while since I made a video and the reason for that is that I like to speak when I feel inspired to speak. And so for the meantime I've just been contemplating on this idea and I had a certain story pop up, a memory that I forgot about. When you start to go down the path of imagining creating reality or imagination is the core of reality you start to see life more symbolically and then you look back at your past and you start to see symbolism in the past. While at one point it was just a memory and then you see how it applies to imagination.

And in my case when I was about 14 years old there was this rule that was placed in the school that we weren't allowed to wear shorts until I think either it was May or June, sorry May or June. And at the time it was April and everybody was complaining about it, it was a new principal that came in and they were very authoritative and they wanted to set up rules that we had to follow. And one of the random rules that they made was no shorts until, we'll say May.

Well it was April and it was a really hot day, this one particular day. And I felt the rule to be really stupid, I didn't understand the point of the rule and I hate following rules for the sake of following them, I want to understand why. And I couldn't wrap my head around why. And it was a hot day and so I decided that day to wear shorts.

And I went to school and someone told on me and I had to go to the principal's office. And at the time we had a head principal and a vice principal. And the head principal walks past me with his coffee in his hand and he gives me an up down and shakes his head. And then the vice principal who was really into, I think it was Jiu Jitsu, I can't remember which one it was, but he was really into one of those martial arts and he actually shoved his forearm to my neck and shoved me against the wall.

And they asked me why did I wear shorts? Obviously I can't respond because his forearm is towards my neck, it's like pushing against my neck. And then he releases it. He asks me again why did you wear shorts? And all I could reply was that well it's April and it's warm. And that was enough to, they suspended me.

But it was an in school suspension so I had to sit in a room in the quiet, which actually was quite nice. I had to sit in a room in the quiet and the only thing that was a downfall was I missed all my classes. But it didn't really matter. But I was in the quiet in my own thoughts and I just sat there thinking about this rule.

And there was a detention teacher, I guess you'd want to say, someone looking over the kids in detention that I was in, and he asked me why did you come into detention, what did you do? And I said well I wore shorts. And he just gave me like the most confused look, like why would that be enough to send you. And I just didn't have an answer. I said I don't know, that's just the rule. I guess I broke the rule.

Now I give this story because I'm not sure why I was thinking about it. It's been so long since that story's happened and I realized that I was trying to break these outside rules. And I was trying to sort of bend and maybe circumvent, maybe I can get away with breaking the rule. And it was so external.

But what I didn't realize at the time was that I was actually really trying to break the internal rules that I created within myself. Because how many, you know, no shorts until May rules that I set up in my mind. You know I made a video called consciousness, or it's like a mental outfit. And that can be applied here, right?

Is that how many times, if we look at states of consciousness as certain articles of clothing that we wear, you know there's certain rules I've set up that I'm not allowed to be in certain states of consciousness that I'm not allowed to, I'm not allowed to wear that. There's a rule that I've placed. Some condition. It has to be May, or it has to be some time period, or I have to have a certain amount of money before, or I have to have a certain amount of intelligence, or I have to be this or that enough before I can imagine having such a thing.

And I set up all these external rules, or really the internal rules that, these conditions that I place upon myself that I actually want to break, I want to stop thinking that I'm not allowed to wear a certain state of consciousness. And yet, I was fighting the outside, I was fighting shadows.

Nothing really happened, right? I mean the moment I, it's not like I changed myself. I just wore shorts. It's not like I did much. But what I was trying to do is that I look back and that was a symbol.

And I don't think I should have broke those rules. I think I should have just followed them. But I didn't at the time. And that really just stemmed from me not wanting to follow, like I said, the rules that I made inside myself.

You know, there's so many states of consciousness I wanted to wear, but I told myself I wasn't, you know, it was too big, or it was too, too big enough. You know, you ever, you ever like go to like a thrift store or something and you see, you see like clothes you think it's going to fit, but you think it's going to be too big. You never really know. That's how it is. You know, you should try it on before you say no. That's what I would say.

And so I don't regret fully that I wore shorts that day. I just, I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but I regret that I, you know, I tried to disrupt the rules that this principle set up. I don't think they should have choked me out. But but regardless, I, it was really the internal rules.

And so I have to ask myself, how many of these rules have I set up within myself? You'd have to ask yourself that. How many conditions have you placed? It could be the silly, it could be such a silly condition, and yet we've placed it upon ourselves. I need to have an X amount of this, or I need to wait until then to wear this state of consciousness that is already within me. It's already something that is inside of me that I'm waiting to occupy.

And Neville said that that is the biggest failure amongst his students was the failure to occupy a state. And a lot of people think about what they want, they think about it all day long. But if you actually live from the idea, they sleep in the idea, they wake up in the idea, they walk in the idea, they think in the idea of being it already. It's being it already. You don't try to be good, you feel that you already are good, and that's how you become it.

And so we move inside ourselves by the assumption of already being it, not through the, certainly not by rules, and not through the efforts on the outside. And so I see that story as a symbol, and so I'm not telling anybody to break any rules, but I am sort of suggesting that you should see the rules and conditions you've set up within yourself that you should probably break, you should probably stop thinking you're not allowed to have a certain state, you're not allowed to wear it, because some person at one point told you you're not allowed to.

I was told many times I wasn't allowed to be a certain thing. Even if I wanted to, I was told I was told no all the time. And that no, when you get told no, you know, that's what happened to Neville in the army, is that he was told no when he wanted to leave. And no matter how many pleas he made, no matter how many times he mentioned his wife and his kid and he needed to take care of, he was told no.

So all the pleas I made in my life that I wanted to be something I was told no, well, you don't go to somebody else to give you permission, you go within yourself, you break the idea of no, you don't let that no be inside, that's what brazen impudence means, you don't let it be a no. You don't have to outwardly do what I did, you don't have to wear the shorts, but I would say wear the mental shorts, wear them, even though you're told you're not allowed to.

The senses will always say you shouldn't or you can't, but do it anyways. And you'll see you already are the thing that you want to be. And as Neville said, the only reason why you don't see is you refuse to believe it, that you already are it. It's the only reason why you don't see it. And so you're told no, there's no way you could ever be such a thing, well, you assume that you already are that thing. You just assume it within yourself, let everyone say what they want to say. Let the rules be there.

So that would be my advice is that to myself, if I had to go back and give myself some advice, I would say leave it, leave it alone. You don't have to do that. Just you start to appropriate within yourself what you want to be. It's not about the, the shorts. It's not about breaking the rules on the outside. It's not about that. It didn't do me anything, right? It got me suspended. It's not like I didn't did me any good.

So what was I really trying to do? Well, I was expressing outwardly what I really wanted to do inwardly, I wanted to break those rules within me.

And I had many, many rules and conditions in place that didn't allow me to occupy the positions I wanted to be in. It was always some little reserve in the back of my mind that stopped me from occupying it. Some ""what if"" - what if it doesn't work, or what if you don't have enough, or how are you going to get that?

It was always some little doubt that I reserved just in case, and that's the rule I wanted to break. I wanted to let go of my doubt, but I thought I had to hold on to it. I thought I had to reason with myself. It had to be logical. I had to figure it out before I could actually accept it and assume it.

And so I never became it. I found myself just going in circles - logical circles. I just found myself going in circles. I never really moved.

The times I did move is when I stopped, I removed all of those questions. I stopped asking myself ""what if"" - I just did it. And what did I do? I started to just do what I wanted to do in the flesh in my imagination. That's what I did.

What is it that I want to do in the flesh? What is it that I want to feel in the flesh? I would feel it. What is it that I want to do in the flesh? I would do it. It didn't matter what it was at a certain point, I stopped caring about it. What do I want to do? I would do it.

And that's what Neville says: you just have to imagine that you are doing it. Don't imagine trying to do it, imagine that you are doing it. Let's go back to the ladder experiment. You don't imagine trying to get a ladder in your mind, you imagine climbing it.

So I don't care what it is, you just start doing it. And you become persistent on doing it. It's just as if it becomes a part of your nature when the more and more you do it because we create ourselves out of our own imagination.

And so take what you will from that story, it's just an interesting story to see it as a symbol, a parable. Although that actually happened, it symbolizes something for me. I saw what I was trying to do. I just didn't do it. I didn't do it internally, I was doing it externally.

I would advise you to do it internally. I don't care what rules you've set up, try to break them by just assuming you already are the thing. And don't let a condition be in the way that stops you from actually occupying it.

And so I'm going to end it here on this video. I just want to give a short story, a parable to make you think about breaking certain rules that you might have created in your own mind that stops you from occupying certain states that you want to be in.

And I also want to say I'm going to take the channel a bit different. I'm going to start speaking about the lectures that I read - I read Neville all the time. And I have so many notes that I've taken from his lectures that I just haven't shared. So I'm going to start sharing them. I'm going to start speaking about his lectures that he said later in his life.

And also this November 22, I'm going live at 2:30pm Eastern Standard Time for members. And I also want to do a public one as well in the future. So keep a lookout for that.

But thanks for listening, guys.",3,1732031890.0,EdwardArtSupplyHands,0,1.0,False

Spectral Capital Group a leading innovator in decentralized cloud technology and advanced quantum ledger solutions outlines its vision for Spectral’s [Vogon DQLDB](https://www.spectralcapital.com/vogon) with Plato Data Intelligence's Bryan Feinberg.

https://preview.redd.it/6csmgvhtrv1e1.jpg?width=1746&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f87844bd08cd11027148836bfe440f4ada36f9cd

**Bryan Feinberg:** Sean, I saw your post on X about Vogon DQLDB and its potential to transform financial systems. You mentioned the importance of human identity at the heart of commercial and capital markets. Can you explain what drives this vision

**Sean Michael Brehm:** At the heart of every market transaction is human identity—the sum of each individual’s daily contributions to the commercial world. This goes beyond financial exchanges; it’s about our choices, our interactions, and our values reflected in the economy. Our Vogon DQLDB is built with this central idea: each person's activity—whether buying, selling, or investing—is a piece of a larger narrative. By indexing these contributions using MSCI’s GICS standards, we categorize each transaction into primary, secondary, and tertiary subindustries, which provides a transparent, honest representation of our roles in the market. This kind of system gives people credit for the economic impact they bring.

**Bryan Feinberg:** So, if I understand correctly, Vogon DQLDB is like a giant record-keeper that recognizes each person’s economic actions—whether I buy coffee, invest, or sell a used phone—as meaningful contributions. It tags each action to specific industries, showing that each of us is part of the economic story. Does that mean we’d all have a role in the markets beyond just being consumers Am I understanding that right, Sean

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Each transaction you make isn’t just about the money; it’s about showing your unique place and contribution in the economy regardless if you are in Boston or Botswana. By tagging actions to sub industries, we’re essentially writing a story where every participant is an author, making the market more inclusive and giving a clear picture of everyone’s impact. You’re not just a consumer; you’re a contributor to the system’s transparency and stability. Today your data is sold to others that do that and you don’t get any of the credit.  Moving forward you remain the custodian of your data, meaning you control how it’s accessed and used within the system.

**Bryan Feinberg:** You mentioned that this indexing could make Vogon DQLDB a modern version of the Buttonwood Agreement, returning transparency to the markets. How does that transparency affect market stability and honesty

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Our team is passionate about returning global markets to the transparency that the Buttonwood Agreement symbolized back in 1792. Back then, agreements were based on mutual accountability and a shared framework. By indexing each person’s contributions and categorizing transactions transparently, Vogon DQLDB restores a sense of trust. It shows how individual contributions make up the foundation of commercial and capital markets. This visibility helps create a more stable system, where people know their daily actions, large or small, are recorded and valued. It’s a fundamental shift back to the ethos of fair and open markets.

**Bryan Feinberg:** This sounds like a fair trade simplification engine where people could see the full picture, with everyone’s contributions kept out in the open, so it’s clear how they matter. Would this make it harder for anyone to ‘game’ the system

**Sean Michael Brehm:** It is all about fair trade and putting the human identity where it belongs: At the center of commercial and capital markets. Just like in the original Buttonwood Agreement, people would understand how their actions impact the system and trust that they’re being accounted for honestly. By making everything visible, we’re closing loopholes that might allow manipulations, making it easier for everyone to see the real, fair value of their contributions. Additionally, Vogon DQLDB employs advanced data encryption to protect individual data, so each person’s data is secure while remaining visible for regulatory and systemic oversight.

**Bryan Feinberg:** Indexing transactions with the GICS standards is an innovative idea. Can you explain how this process works within DQLDB

**Sean Michael Brehm:** When someone makes a transaction, Vogon DQLDB automatically categorizes it according to MSCI’s GICS standards, tagging it to a primary, secondary, and tertiary subindustry. This indexing means that every action—sale, investment, or trade—gets transparently attributed within the market. DQLDB essentially creates a ledger transaction and a transparent, user-owned database organized as coalitions, where the impact of each transaction is visible and accountable. Individuals maintain custodianship over their data, meaning they can access, review, and even limit how this data is used in certain contexts. Their identity is protected by post quantum cryptography. This way, we see exactly where your human effort drives the market and how industries connect to individual and collective activity. It’s a level of granularity in understanding our economic footprint that’s never been possible before and because you remain anonymous, it drives the value of your data up further.

**Bryan Feinberg:** If I buy something, the system tags that purchase based on what industry it falls into—like ‘Food and Drink’ if I buy lunch or ‘Tech’ if I buy a laptop. By tracking all my activities this way, DQLDB builds a clear picture of which industries are thriving or struggling based on my actions. Would it be like a mirror reflecting where I am putting all my money and time

**Sean Michael Brehm:** It’s exactly that—a mirror reflecting our individual and collective choices that drive the economy. It provides an accurate picture of which industries matter most based on individual actions. Plus, it helps both individuals and businesses make informed choices by showing how their economic footprint interacts with market trends.

**Bryan Feinberg:** You’ve talked about Vogon DQLDB supporting regulatory compliance. How does this focus on human identity and transaction visibility play out for financial oversight

**Sean Michael Brehm:** With Vogon DQLDB, regulators get a transparent, unbiased view of the market’s structure, right down to individual contributions. Each transaction reflects an identity within its industry, showing patterns that could reveal stability or potential risks. For example, if regulators notice a concentration of activity in specific sectors or a sudden shift in consumer behavior, they can respond proactively. This visibility helps create honest markets where contributions aren’t hidden or obscured but instead provide a stable foundation for economic oversight. We’re also in discussions with financial regulatory bodies to align our approach with industry standards, ensuring Vogon DQLDB can meet compliance requirements globally. It’s about building a fairer market system that operates with each participant's best interests in mind.

**Bryan Feinberg:** The DQLDB essentially lets regulators ‘see’ the entire market more clearly—like a map that shows where all the action is happening and helps them spot risky trends early on. How does this make it easier to keep the market stable and safe for everyone

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Now, with the Vogon DQLDB, regulators have a map to follow the action across sectors and industries in real time. They can react faster to shifts, and this creates a stable environment where everyone’s interests are protected. By enhancing transparency, we’re also limiting opportunities for shady practices to slip through the cracks.

**Bryan Feinberg:** Your post also touched on high-frequency transactions. How does the Vogon DQLDB balance technical efficiency with personal, transparent data representation

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Vogon is designed for both speed and integrity. With our epoch-based structuring and VMerkelPairs, it handles high-frequency data while preserving each transaction’s unique identity. Every data entry in the ledger-database is preserved with its industry attribution, creating a clear, real-time trail of our daily economic footprint. This is essential for creating an open, honest system where people see how their actions contribute to the broader economy. Vogon DQLDB doesn’t just record transactions—it reflects them back as part of a shared economic narrative, helping people feel involved while also using energy-efficient processes that reduce its carbon footprint. This way, we support both high transaction speeds and environmental responsibility.

**Bryan Feinberg:** So, the technology is fast enough to handle lots of transactions per second, but it doesn’t lose track of what each transaction actually represents. Is it fair to say that, even though the system processes everything at high speed, it still keeps a ‘personal touch’ by showing the meaning behind each transaction and keeping it secure

**Sean Michael Brehm:** Even though it’s fast, DQLDB is about showing how each one of your transactions—or organizational transactions—fits into the bigger picture. It does so security. Every action is recorded in a way that preserves its importance, so we see not just numbers but the real, human impact behind them and how businesses and governments use them responsibly.

**Bryan Feinberg:** Hearing about this focus on human identity, how do you see Vogon DQLDB impacting financial interactions for everyday people

1gv0gf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gv0gf4/husband_messaging_his_cousin/,Husband messaging his cousin. ,"My (25) husband (31) and I have been married for three years. We moved out of the country three months agoand I come and go while I’m finishing school. So we are LD. We have 2 kids. (2-3) I saw them this weekend for a couple days. And I was ordering some food on his phone. When he received a message from his cousin. And I thought it was odd because she said something like “you should have come with me. Look at what I bought..” so I asked and he said it was his cousin. Who lives down the street from our home. I’m intrigued and I ask him if I could see the messages. He didn’t complain, just handed me the phone. The messages were pretty tame. But there was a lot where she was inviting him over for breakfast. Or where he would ask “is the coffee ready.” They had only been interacting for a couple days. And she had asked him for a ride to the nearest large city. (40 min away.) He said yes because he was running an errand but didn’t end up taking her after all. However, he messaged her every day asking what she was doing and if she still wanted a ride to town. He was very insistent. And the conversation continued throughout the whole day. He would continuously ask about her day. What she was doing, where her husband was. And if she was in bed or was still hanging out in the living room. She lives with her husband and mother and they have a son together. There was also messages saying “sweet dreams.” He claims he has a good relationship with her and even is on good terms with her husband.  He says he has gone over to have breakfast with his aunt, her mother. And has even taken my kids. But this is the first I’m hearing about it. He says he was keeping the conversation going with all his questions. He doesn’t see the conversation as inappropriate. However, when we message each other throughout the day I’m lucky if I get a couple messages. And he’s always “busy” and never answers the phone. He sends her pictures of everything he does during the day. And even will say if he doesn’t answer it’s because he doesn’t have signal. I’ve never been insecure and this has happened one other time with his coworker the messages were also tame. But happened while I was out of town. My family was not great growing up. And I know the family dynamic is different in every family. But am I wrong for being upset? He says he is going to “isolate” himself and not talk to anybody because it upsets me. But I don’t want him to not talk to anybody. I just think there should be boundaries and respect.

TLDR: Husband is messaging with his cousin. And I think some messages are not appropriate. But he says they have a good relationship and I’m overreacting. ",1,1732031885.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

I don't want to see my classmates, who might as well be who I thought was anybody I ever knew. My professors often remind us that there's only one of them, and 40 to 200 students. Just an anthill. I always wondered what the purpose of an ants life was. The nonstop moving, to feed, to build, to attend the queen who births more of who might as well be me, or my former best friend. When do the ants experience pleasure? Whats the point of a birds life? The part where they wake up as a vulnerable sack of skin and their parents feed them and keep them warm, that part makes sense. But what after? To fly, to feed, to worry about predators, to worry about feeding. Do the birds experience pleasure? What about a lions life? I saw a nature documentary and the lions were having a real hard time. They were hungry and failed to bring down an elephant, or maybe it was a zebra. They had walked for days and miles stalking that elephant or zebras and still failed. They looked miserable and starving. When do they have pleasure? Whats the point? Is the point all to just eat, make babies who die in the dessert sun, eat the babies if they can't eat an elephant? 

I understand my dog's life. I can see the pleasure in her eyes when she stretches and sighs deeply and falls asleep and her eyes are half open and glazing over. And she looks at me with pupils larger than the Grinchs heart, or any heart I know for that matter, except maybe hers because she is pure and she only exists in pleasurable moments. She's warm, she's fed, she dances to say hello. She moves as she wants, she wags her tail so determinedly and I swear she smiles, all these years of us humans breeding dogs and favoring the cute little ones, it's making them have the ability to smile. She smiles. She frowns. She's spayed and her babies won't die in the sun. She's domesticated. I don't understand the life of wild animals but I understand hers. 


I'm not domesticated. I'm a gorilla born in a zoo. Or a peacock that roams freely around the zoo without a cage and you wonder, how do the zookeepers trust that the visitors won't try to fuck that peacock up? How is that allowed? Or a pigeon that doesn't belong to the zoo, was never recruited to the zoo, but it's here now, I'm here now, is the pigion a visitor or another peacock or a lion who's baby aren't dead in a desset but transported to London to be apart of a different zoo? Is the pigion a gorilla who knows deep down that something is fucking wrong and there's another life it could be living without the glass encloser with fake trees and tire swings, not fake but unnatural, with hay, hay that doesn't exist in the jungle. Well, I guess not. The pigion isn't trapped. But does the pigion look around and wonder? The pigion was domesticated by humans years ago. Surely the pigion knows. Does the pigion have pleasure? 

I'm getting off topic. I saw the 7:30am on my phone and I knew. There was no way I was getting up and making it to my 9am class. I'm not stalking those elephants for days. I don't have babies dying in the sun. I don't have to conform anymore. I never belonged in a classroom. I never belonged at mcdonalds. I never belonged in an ant hill, feeding the queen who births more siblings because I and my other 4000 siblings aren't enough for her. And why do they all know to worship the queen? I don't know ant biology but I'd be so proud if even one ant decided to revolt. Fuck the queen and fuck her sand dome. She's everything the ants work for. She is the heart of the allegorical body that 4000 ants make up. She might as well be a former best friend, or a dead fly on a window seal that is too gross to clean up, or a spider you gaslight yourself into pretending you didn't see because you saw it in Thailand and they're huge there, or a rat in the wall that doesn't really bother you, and only just a few years ago, rats were terrifying. Ratatouille gave you nightmares and now, a rat might be the only thing you relate too. A rat in the walls. Doesn't belong there. Where the hay is fake. Not quite a peacock. More like a pigion. 

I'm getting off track again. The 7:30am alarm. It went off. I saw the number and I knew there was no fucking way I was getting up. I had 9am class. There was no way. Where was the point, the pleasure? I wondered if I should email my professor. My dog woke up too and she danced to me and licked my ears. My third thought of the day was who would I rehome her too. The zoo? That's  a joke. I know some people. I know she'll miss me. She's cared for, and she exists for pleasure. And she'll miss me. But I'm afraid to admit, I won't miss her pleasurably the way you might miss the flavour of a very good cake you ate once, or the flavor of instant coffee in a hostel in the Melbourne City Business District, where your friend was permanently banned and you stayed at the zoo. I won't miss my dog in the way you miss sitting down with no thoughts when you're 7 hours deep into a shift, or how you miss a movie when you walk out of the theatre. I'll miss her like I'll miss my former best friend. I'll miss her like a dead baby in the sun, having tried my best, but failing, to take the elephant or the zebras down. I'll miss her like a lion goes ""well, that sucked. Time to keep walking."" Because lions don't give up. I wonder what the point is.

### Training

I started running last summer with the intent to slowly build toward a March marathon. I used the Train As One ""AI coaching"" app which didn't go very well. I probably did something wrong, but it didn't increase my mileage quickly enough and I didn't realize how unprepared I was until late in the process. Because of that, March seemed unrealistic, so I decided to target Richmond in the fall instead. I stopped using the app and came up with my own ""plan"" of about 30 miles a week that included a tempo run and a long run of 10 miles. I followed that for a couple of months and then ran 2 half marathons a month or so apart, with both results coming in around 1:40. I switched to Pfitz 18/55 and used my half marathon times to set my training paces. That gave me a marathon target of around 3:30, which seemed respectable for a first attempt.

&nbsp;

Pfitz went well; I worried that I didn’t have a sufficient base, but I had no issues with the plan and never missed a workout or pace. That comes with a caveat, though. Both of my half marathons were probably slower than they should have been. The first was a hilly trail race and the second was hot and humid with poor support and an awkward course. Because of those factors, my potential for a ""good"" race was probably faster than my actual results. I also never updated my training paces to match my improving fitness because I wanted to be conservative for my first marathon. By the time race day came around, my Garmin's race predictor had me at 3:16, but I planned to stick with my original 3:30 target until around mile 20 and then push from there if I felt good. I was being cautious, but I was trying hard to prioritize ""not blowing up"" since I didn’t know what to expect. A couple days before the race I made a late call to be more optimistic and run with the 3:25 pacers instead.

&nbsp;

In the footwear department, I bought some Adios Pro 3s and trained with them for most of my taper runs. The upper caused me problems, as it does for most people. I tore out the lower two lace loops but that wasn't enough. I ended up wearing a couple pairs of thick socks along with a donut-shaped blister bandage over the problem area and that felt great, my last few training runs were pain free and easy.

&nbsp;

### Pre-race

I normally get up at 6. Two weeks before the race I started shifting my schedule 15 minutes earlier each day so that I could still get 8 hours on race day. Three days before the race I started a carb load. The Featherstone calculator suggested 550g per day but I only managed about 450, which was 500 calories over my daily needs (I weigh and track using an app). 550 might have been better but it felt excessive and I hoped 450 would get me most of the way there.

&nbsp;

I got a hotel the night before the race and on race morning I woke up at 3:30 after a good sleep. Breakfast was 2 pieces of homemade bread with jam, coffee with cream and sugar and 20 ounces of Gatorade for about 600 calories. I didn't eat or drink anything else until the race. I drove to a parking garage and arrived at 5 then stayed in my car for about 45 minutes; the garage got very busy around 5:30 so it seemed I’d made a good call by getting there 2 hours in advance.

&nbsp;

I walked up to the race and arrived at 6, sat on a curb and took in the sights. At 6:30 I got in the bathroom line. The race director said a bunch of stuff that I couldn't hear because the bathroom lines weren't close enough. I made it through the line after 20 minutes, which was tighter than I would have liked, but it worked out. I donated my throwaway sweats, hopped the corral rail and packed myself in behind the 3:25 group. A few minutes later and we were off!

&nbsp;

### Race

The early minutes were a blur, the street was packed and there wasn't much room for passing so I tried to hold position and keep the 3:25 group in sight. I was carrying two 5 ounce squeeze bottles in a running belt, each of which contained a syrup of 110g table sugar / 2g sodium citrate. My nutrition plan was to drink 1/5 of a bottle (a medium sip) and a couple gulps of water every 2 miles at water stops through mile 20. That plan failed at the very first stop, which was so chaotic that I didn't even bother to try for water. The same scene would play out several more times over the first half of the race; I got water at some stops and had to skip others. I realized that part of the problem was sticking with a large pace group. I also realized that everyone in the pace group seemed to be working a lot harder than I was. Those things combined made me consider leaving the group.

&nbsp;

After missing water for the third or fourth time at mile 12, I got fed up and decided I'd rather push and blow up than finish strong with more left in the tank. I started running by feel and tried to keep my heart rate in the 160s instead of 145-155 where it had been. I felt great until mile 18, which was about when my heart rate started to creep into the 170s (180 is roughly my max). I was starting to hurt, but I focused on finding my most efficient gear and not trying to pass more runners. Around mile 23 I started to doubt my ability to hold on; my heart rate was high, I hurt and I was starting to feel a hint of nausea. I backed off just a little and had a couple sips of water without nutrition (which had run out) and both of those things helped. I shut my mind off and was able to stick to my pace.

&nbsp;

As others have said, the final downhill is an absolute nightmare. Richmond advertises their ""downhill finish"" as a feature, but that steep hill on wobbly legs right at the end feels legitimately dangerous. Thankfully I stayed upright, crossed the finish line and high-fived my wife who had fought her way to the front after apparently organizing a ""gang"" of spectators to rotate in and out of the primo viewing area as each person's runner crossed the line. Very funny (and appreciated), but this is one of the few downsides of the Richmond marathon; there's almost no space for spectators at the finish line.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I finished the race in 3:14:28, which felt incredible because I would have been pleased with sub 3:30. I knew I was likely faster than 3:30, but I thought 3:20 was my most optimistic stretch goal. Sub 3:15 made me feel that a BQ, sub-3, etc, might actually be in my future, especially since the race dropped my Garmin predictor to 3:11.

&nbsp;

### Post-race


I was sore and unsteady after the race, which was worrying, but also made me feel confident that I’d given everything I had. I shuffled my way through the post-race party and managed to get some swag and snacks, but since the party is on a small island with limited space, it was packed, an absolute mad-house. No doubt there's plenty of room when the elites roll in, but when my hobby-jogger self showed up it was an unpleasant shoulder-to-shoulder experience. I'd planned to get some pizza and check out a few booths, but the crowds made that almost impossible. I sipped water and slowly ate a few chips instead while I tried to make my way out of the area. I eventually made it back to my car, then the hotel, then a restaurant and that was a wrap!

&nbsp;

### Final Thoughts

Richmond was a great event, I enjoyed it from start to finish and was able to smash my (admittedly conservative) goals. My only real complaint is the post-finish experience where there's simply not enough room unless you're very fast, slow, or patient.

&nbsp;

I think I learned a lot about being part of a large race and how to manage my effort level over time. Next time I plan to pick a target much closer to my Garmin estimate, adjust my training paces over time and try to run a more evenly split race. I was very happy with my shoes, carb load, nutrition strategy and sleep schedule; I plan to repeat all of those next time. I'm taking a week completely off, then I'm going to carefully reverse taper into the Hanson Advanced marathon plan. I was happy with my Pfitz results, but I didn’t care for the late-plan speedwork, tune-up races or having two days off per week. Hanson seems like a reasonable step up in effort with a more appealing schedule (to me) so I'm looking forward to trying it.

&nbsp;

So I countered her and I put a tiny TV in the corner and I let anyone use it and now she says I’m bullying her because I told her she can use it if other people can use her TV and she will not agree to do that. So I told her she may not use the common room tv unless she lets others use her tv or puts it back into her room. I eventually had to start hiding my stuff from her because she was eating all my food and she was using my stuff and destroying it. During one fight, she told me that she was eating all of my food and sharing it with her friends and when I asked her to stop, she says you said I could use it.  eventually put everything into my room and made her get her own pots and pans and silverware and coffee maker and everything because she was just using mine and breaking it and not replacing it. She also was taking stuff out of my room and putting it into the living room or in her room. Example, she took my signed Taylor Swift record and put it in her room to show her girlfriend saying it was hers… whenever I try to calmly address the issues, she just will scream and yell and say I’m just being mean to her. 

She also throws parties in here with 30+ people and told us after that six of them were minors meaning 16 years old in our student housing. We tried to explain to her that she can't do that. She won't tell us about the parties now. We just have to walk into them. 

This entire apartment has a hostile environment. We also worked together so she will post everything about what’s going on here to the Work chat and now a lot of people at Work don’t like me because what she has said even if it’s not true. i’ve now had to lock my dog in the room because she will come in and mess with him. I’ve had to put cameras up in my own apartment to make sure she’s not fucking with people stuff. Now all the roommates have just gone to their partners house because they don’t want to stay here with her, but I can’t do that because my partner lives in a different part of the state and I feel like this living situation is so stressful on me.

1guzyue,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1guzyue,The significance of this chapter ,"If anyone is confused. Denji isn’t optimistic because he just “got over” Nayuta’s death, or any of his other family members. He’s finally beginning to understand the beauty surrounding memories. 

So far with what we’ve seen with Denji is that he’s been traumatized from the deaths of everyone who got close to him, hence the reason why he took Yoshida’s deal to not transform into CSM due to the concern of losing another family member to him in the form of Nayuta.

The panels from Goodbye Eri, especially the ending support this CSM chapter. Yuta sees the pain of constantly losing close people and finds it meaningless to try to make relationships. Eri on the other hand, while agreeing it will be painful, understands that as long as she has the memories of the ones she close to, they’ll never be truly dead.

In CSM, being truly dead is simply being forgotten. It’s why Pochita’s concept erasure is the only known method of permanently destroying a devil; as devils are based on concepts, having nothing there to remember the devil will effectively kill it. 

A concept means nothing if nobody knows or remembers what it is. 

Death is also an inevitable outcome for all things, it’s simply a part of life and that’s normals 

Nobody can simply move on from the loss of a loved one, but we learn to appreciate the memories we have with them. I think this can be applied to Denji. 

Pochita throwing up those devils was meant to allow Denji to remember the people who were special to him. How the snow reminded him of Aki and Power and all of the fun times they had.

The bitterness of the coffee during his time with Reze, the second girl he developed romantic feelings for and had pleasant moments with her (learning how to swim and basic education).  

Even if we may never see them again, it’s the memories that we, the readers, and Denji have of these characters that allow us to appreciate them.

Denji finally realizes that he’s going to develop relationships with people regardless of what happens. It’s an inevitable trait all humans have. And even if they end up passing on, as long as the memories of them still exist, they’ll never be dead.

This is the character development Denji needed, and we’re in for some serious peak fiction from here on out.

It's a great question. It's a useful tool as a writer if you get a bit stuck or have taken a break and can't remember what you had planned, or if you can't remember what you've been working on because you've been writing for almost twenty days straight, or you just need word count.

Today's tip is to give your characters the Marty McFly experience, (or Loki, if you watched those TV series). 

When I look at my own life, which at this point is fairly comfortable, I have tried to re-write my own life story to see if I could have avoided all the pain and broken relationships, yet still end up where I am today. It never works out.

But it's worth the effort, especially if you need words.

It's also another great way to get into your character's head and experience things from their point of view. The character made choices (that is, you made choices for them) that led to into the beginning of the story and those things weren't on the page. Small boring details like getting up, wearing that shirt, deciding to take the same train into the city, or whatever. 

Can they think about how much better their life would be had they made different choices and then (being a the good writer you are who doesn't want your protagonist to be comfortable for too long) show them exactly why any other choices they had made would have made things worse:

1. If they hadn't been at the bank, they would not have been on hand to defuse the bomb that got the story rolling and several made-up people would be dead
2. If they had ordered the tea instead of coffee for breakfast, they wouldn't have been mistaken as the spy in the first place.
3. If they hadn't gone to the tavern, they would have missed the tale of adventure and treasure that put that stupid idea in their head.

And so on.

How would your character try to write the story they're stuck in right now?",1,1732030506.0,nanowrimo,1,1.0,False

I heard the door creak and saw him he was tall and white and bald. I yelled out hello to him and he didn’t answer. He walked away quickly at the sound of my voice. I don’t know if it was a hallucination or my roommates boyfriend who happens to suffer from insomnia. However it’s really weird for him to be trying to watch me while I’m sleeping from my open doorway. The figure looked just like him too. The other weird thing that makes me think it was maybe him was that he didn’t come downstairs in the morning.

It was discontinued at the end of the same year, that’s why you don’t hear or see this appear much on the market.

by Joy Harjo

The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.
The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on.
We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it.
It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women.
At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers.
Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table.
This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun.
Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory.
We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here.
At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks.

(I know, I know it's not good but I bought a small bottle from a source I trust oh Mecari, then immediately bought another two more lol.

And NOW I'm seeing they have the big bottles for $40 on the NA website. Guys, I am *so* tempted to grab one as a Christmas gift for myself (or, yk....it'll be from my husband I guess but I'd be picking it out and ordering it lol). I've heard recently that these larger bottles and the Retro Wall bottles are kind of thin/almost watery....and my small bottles of SDM are on the thin side. One is so watery, I actually do wonder if it was watered down?

So my two main questions (amidst this appreciation thread!) are:

1.) Exactly *how* thin is this shower gel supposed to be? I can and will use it either way, but you have to use it differently depending if it's thick/concentrated or more thin in consistency. And

2.) What are y'all favorite things to do with/mix with this gorgeous sg? One thing I do like is I've noticed it's one of the better shower gels that I can use as a shampoo (hair type: thin but dry and very wavy). I tend to either use a coffee-scented lotion afterwards (especially the OGX coconut and caffeine conditioner and lotion) or something citrus-y....favorites being Lime Bounty body butter and orange anything (I have some orange body creams from the old Body Shop Satsuma line and also one from Beekman 1802: all are *lovely* with this. Supermilk in my hair afterwards is also nice. And I'm thinking the Celebrate massage bar might also be great with it.

A guest preacher!,"Good morning, snark friends and family! Starting the day off STANDING STRONG IN THE ARMOR OF GOD! (the armor is sponsored by coffee, adderall and diet coke).

Before we get started, a PSA. Some of you might be thinking, ""Tony Polar, why are you just doing this review in 10 minute bits?"" First of all, thank you for asking me about my small, women-owned, internet-based business of writing niche essays about fundamentalist families. As always, I strive to bring the best possible quality and attention to detail in my snark recaps, hence the timestamps. Some of you are loving this. I do feel that i must caution everyone that this wedding video clocks in at an HOUR AND A HALF, so we are in for a long haul. If you enjoy these, thats probably fine. If not, you will be incredibly annoyed at probably 13-14 separate parts.  

The silver lining is that I am SEVERELY hoping for a Gabriel and Brianne engagement movie and if that comes, please watch this page because I am ENTRANCED by Brianne and the sociopath that I feel strongly dwells within her.

Now that that is out of the way, here is our recap:

When we last left our intrepid couple, Jill and her father had just broken their unwavering and intense eye contact and Jill was summarily pushed by OG Tim into her new headship. ITS TIME TO CLEAVE BABY IT STARTS NOW.

33:58: I'm noticing Jill's veil. It definitely is not for show and has the front piece that google tells me is a blusher and it definitely gives that ""daughter of a fundamentalist family being married off"" vibes, which is what I think we are going for. If that wasn't enough, Jill's veil also features the big tulle spray that people were creaming their pants over in the 80s, so its perfect for now (I think they kind of make everyone looks like those chickens with the puffy heads and this is no exception)

34:09: Lisa getting in there to straighten the dress (way to understand the assignment). I feel like we need a deep dive on Lisa. Jill, and to a lesser extent, Ugly and Fugly, are in the Jill multiverse, but we don't hear much about Lisa, and I feel like Jill really phoned in her Toybox killer voice over about how great she is. In fact, one of the phrases was about Lisa knowing all Jill's secrets-is this is a threat? 

34:22: Oddly enough, I thought to myself before I started this ten minute block of writing that ""hmm, maybe it will go fast because its the vows portion and it will just be a lot of Bibley type stuff, but the joke is on me. 

(music swells)

We have another musical number and I hope the accompanying choreography is just not making the guests look at Jill and David looking at each other. It's a bit meta and sounds like an R. Kelly opera.

34:26: A slow zoom in to an extreme closeup of David, which is extremely flattering and the longer the camera is on him the more I'm like ""Is David attractive?"" and I'm thinking now that yes, he was ! He had a sort of Freddie Mercury vibe that would probably work better on Tinder, then he married Jill, and she siphoned all his energy away.  I also now I understand how watching these YouTube videos can radicalize you. One minute you're wondering if David Rodridgues was attractive and the next you have a horn helmet on storming the capital. No IN BETWEEN!

34:44: After our extremely flattering close up of David's face, the camera pans over to a SEVERELY unflattering profile shot of Jill from behind the veil. you can't really see her face, just like, the outline of what looks like a prominent jaw (which she does not have) and its reminding me of that optical illusion we used to see where they would ask if you would see a little girl or an old woman first and I SEE BOTH HERE.

35:10: This song is LIVE people, and the way I just dicovered that is someone caterwauled off key a few seconds ago. The camera pans over to one of the performers who's fucking sitting down. Goddamn amateur hour, and that's why you'll always be an opener here at Glen Baptist Church. 

Two minutes in. Good God.

35:38: Whoops! Back to the ceremony. I think we're going to do this and I hope there won't be any more musical acts until the finale. 

35:59: What a treat for our guests who have sat through 14 opening numbers, including a woman on a saw, a thinly veiled hostage situation with the bridesmaids, and uncomfortable four minute solo of a father and daughter looking at each other, and then a warbling solo. All to hear that Jill and David have considerately invited some fucking guy (trademarked) to do some guest preaching. FUN! If there is something I always say, if theres one thing better than regular preaching, its guesting preaching.

36:16: Right off the bat, our guest preacher is not good at enunciation (which I can sympathize with). Jill cackles at something he said. We'll never know what.

36: 26: I make out ""is your dad paying for the reception."" None of your business guy, and yes, I think that man who was up there uploading his thoughts into his daughter telepathically is probably paying.

36:36: two things he wants to talk about. That is two things too many. 

35:50: This preacher says ""things might take a little longer here than you are used to (the preaching)..."" to which i say, that is the understatement of the century. 

36:59: The preacher says he attended a wedding that only took about 4 minutes and 50 seconds and now I'm wondering if I know this preacher and if he was in NH around 10 years ago. 

In case you were wondering, the Lord, Jesus, and this preacher all like to have things drag on for eternity, which is a similar length to how long you will be together DAVID AND JILL.

38:01: At some point, David had to stop and think ""Is the woman I want to spend my life with?""  This is presented without comment by me.  He probably couldn't know the answer to that until about five minutes ago during the father daughter eye fuck, but it was too late by then.

38:06: There is an extremely tall man standing by the window and his head is hitting the frame and its just past it, and I don't know why, but it is making me smile, and that has been your intrusive thought for the day.

38:48: ""even though David and Jill had written, and conversed, and all that..."" I should know the answer to this and I could probably look it up (I guess in my fundie encyclopedia) but I want us all to think about how much we think David and Jill talked personally from their first date to their marriage. I'm going to guess maybe 5 times. 

38:58: Jill had to respond to David's proposal based on his character and as we know, usually 18 year old girls are SEVERELY good at this, especially Jill, who decided to do a full scale photo shoot with one of her sons and their girlfriends during the FUCKING RECEPTION of that wedding. And while we are on that topic, how much of a SHIT FIT would Jill have thrown if David's mom took her daughter out next to the highway near BEAUTIFUL SENECA LAKE in WATKINS GLEN, and did a fucking photo shoot? 

39:10: can this guy take care of me? I mean, the jury is still out. 

39:20: The guest preacher goes, ""looks like she said yes."" HYuck yuck yuck, this one killed at the IBLP molesting picnic last year!

39:25: The other reason we are all here is you guys got an invitation in the mail! And have you SEEN these invitations today? What with their fancy papers, and various other papers included? Not a sign of MS Paint graphics in sight? Shutterfly would blow this guys mind.

If we hadn't gotten that invitation, we wouldn't be here...unless you were invited, or you were asked as someone's date, or you just heard about David getting married and decided it would be a blessing to be here?....um preacher, I'm starting to think you don't know how invitations work! And who was sitting around being like, ""Wait what did you just say? David Rodrigues is getting married? Holy shit, we gotta go NOW"" (Car screeches out of parking lot)

40:13; WE got that invite in the mail and we had to RESPOND to that. Sir, were you never invited places? 

40:28: This guy here, and this gal here, they both have great spiritual truths behind them! 

40:48: as sweet as this relationship has been this day, David and Jill's relationship could not go past the state of knowledge of the heart, until Jill accepted that proposal and came here today to get married. You seen, sometimes your heart starts KNOWING something when you meet someone and then other things start wanting to KNOW as well, and that is when you must THROW yourself into something, either into marriage or into the ocean.

41:17: For many people, they have heard of Jesus Christ. You know, now that you mention it, I HAVE been hearing about this guy! What's his deal?

The GP (Guest Preacher) says we might have you know, heard some things on the radio about this Jesus, or maybe you've gotten a tract about him, maybe you even go to some Church and believe in God! But, until you accept God's proposal and send him the RSVP card, it don't. mean. shit.  I think this is unfair because I have been seeing God for about 40 years now, and he has never once proposed and if he wanted, to he would, right ladies?

41:52: David and Jill could not enjoy their relationship until she accepted his proposal and they got married. Once this is over though, they can bump uglies all they want and Jesus can't say shit about it. 

42:20: After God proposes to you, you then get an invitation (to my own wedding to God? Ok? ) and the preacher is plucking the sky miming getting this invitation. I do not think the guest preacher has 1. ever received mail and 2. if he has, it wasn't an invite to anything

Maybe its not God that sends the invite though, it could be anything. And if you throw that invite away with your credit card offers and junk mail and don't respond, YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HERE, at this point, probably 85% of the congregation is questioning their religious choices (""We might go to hell, honey, but at least we don't have to watch a saw solo anymore."")

43:47: I was so so wrong about the vows portion being quick. So very wrong. 

44:14: ""Someone drowning in the water cannot help themselves. Someone burning in a fire cannot help themselves. Here are some other ways you could die and do nothing about it.  Someone stuck in an avalanche...""

44:20: ""And that's what Jesus Christ would say."" At that point, Preacher should have dropped the Bible, BOOM! Talk over!  He went a different direction with it though and decided to talk more.

44:35: ""Its not about that religion or this religion..."" Sir, have you met these people? They hand out religious tracts for...I guess a living? 

44:58: ""God's invitation is this..."" I just know this guy was SO PROUD of himself for this metaphor. ""This will really fucking blow the roof off David and Jill's wedding.""

45:03: ""On July 3, 1978, I got on my knees and accepted god's invite and god's proposal. "" Oh, so you've been seeing God TOO? You fucking WHORISH SLUT.

Really regretting the decision to try to make it through this guy's speech before I ended.

45:30: I know I'm a sinner and I'm doomed to go to Hell. JESUS CHRIST, keep it light!

45:45: This guy isn't even pretending to be making a wedding speech. Talking about himself. Him and God DESERVE each other. 

46:17: David is like, dear God, my knees are locking. 

46:31: Close up on the Junior Ring Bearer (EYE ROLL) just completely defeated in a pew. 

47:03: ....snore! I woke up...this is the part he likes guys! Hey guys, are you listening it gets really good! He gives us eternal life! Everyone in this church is thinking if this guy is going to be in Heaven, how good can it be?

47:20 If you are willing to exercise repentance towards God...he might be willing to get back together with you, I don't know, he has a lot going on right now and he's not looking for anything long term.

48:05: WE all deserve to go to Hell! Sir, they are already there!!!!

48:31: ""Someone almost 2000 years ago came to God for my salvation..."" and ye, as he labored on the cross and was pierced by their spears, Jesus said ""My blood....for...the...invitation metaphor...Beautiful...seneca...lake...watkins...glen...."" and then he died.

48:47: ""If you liked this prayer about God,  hit like and subscribe...If you think Jesus is better...comment below...""

.....and just like that, a quick transition and we are going to hit the main stage show at an incredible and SEVERELY logic DEFYING 48:56 (and I can't even be totally sure if that's true because NO SPOILERS).

  
If you are still with me, thank you !

1guzlrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1guzlrp/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_go_on_a_two_week_trip_to/,AITAH for not wanting to go on a two week trip to New Zealand with my friends.,"My friend Katie (23f) just returned from her nine-month study abroad in New Zealand. Except for the last few months, when she was always too busy for a video chat, we video-chatted with our other friend Lara (23f) every other week, as the three of us have been close friends since primary school (Katie and Lara even since kindergarten). 

When she finally returned from New Zealand we decided to meet up, get a coffee and talk.  Katie asked what was going on with us, but seemed very uninterested and if she was just waiting until we had finished talking so that she could get started. Of course, she probably had the more interesting stories to tell, but things had happened to us too. Lara finished writing her bachelor's thesis and I moved in with my boyfriend. As Katie seemed so excited to talk about her trip, I didn't want to mention my move at all. Also because Katie always reacted negatively to my boyfriend because she believed he would hold me back from doing things like partying with her. In my opinion, that's not true at all, my boyfriend is the sweetest, most accommodating person I know and if I wanted to go to a club every week, he would accept it. It's just that I don't want to, I've been partying enough in my college life and I'm just enjoying the peace and quiet (which still means I meet up with friends a lot and go out for drinks) while I finish my degree. 

When Lara did mention my moving in together and Katie reacted as distantly as expected, I dismissed it as no big deal because I didn't want to talk about it any further out of fear she would talk about it in a derogatory way.

Then the conversation just continued and Katie announced that she wanted to go on vacation to New Zealand for 2 months at the beginning of next year because it's so great there and asked if we wanted to come along. I immediately said no, as it wouldn't work out with my degree and I didn't want to be separated from my boyfriend for so long. Katie then accused me of not being able to do anything with me since I had a boyfriend. She then said that I could also only come with them for 2 weeks. She ignored the fact that Lara couldn't/didn't want to come either. Since that would also be too long for me, I said no again. I knew that the logical arguments were that I didn't have time because of university and that I didn't have the money for such a big vacation just like that, but I still wanted her to understand that it was up to me how long I wanted to be away from my boyfriend, so I said it like that. So she went on to accuse me of never being able to go on girls' trips again because of me. Even though we'd never been away together for more than 5 days before. I then told her that I would be happy to go somewhere together for 5 days, but not for 2 weeks, but she seemed still mad. Next, Katie asked annoyed if that would still be the case if I were married or had children, to which I answered honestly that I would definitely not go away if I had small children. She then offered to pay for a babysitter, if I can't trust my boyfriend with these hypothetical kids, so I could come along. 

She said that in such a generous manner, that I had a hard time keeping it together. She proceeded to say how disappointed she was in me and how I would prefer my boyfriend and future children over my friends (which I confirmed, but that shocked her even more), and that I had my priorities wrong. Lara then luckily changed the topic and I stayed calm, but the talk borders me since that day. So, AITAH?",1,1732029718.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

 It seemed like a good idea to Zane-Bob Jimenez at the time.  Since you can get healed back from pretty much anything thanks to alien space magic, why not see if the alien space magic enhancement they were using on coffee worked on booze too? Pain pierced his skull and lanced down to his lower back, his tongue was sour with vomit and parched with thirst. Sight and sound were agony. 


 ZB staggered up from the unfamiliar mattress and slowly hobbled to the bathroom.  Fortunately he had some dignity intact.  Somehow. There was something with fur in the bed. He'd have to figure out what after. And where he was.  


 The noisome dirge of waste upon the commode woke Velawyr from her slumber. She had done the deed with an alien. For the first time in recorded history, an alien had been willing and able to sleep with a Triii.  Axiom caused all thinking peoples to be able to interbreed. One could even sleep with a Floric. It wasn't a good idea, but more survivable than any skin contact with a Triii. Therefore as many as 1% of the Galaxy's Gravids assumed that since the Trii did not interbreed, they are not truly thinking peoples. Of course that view was censured among mainstream Gravids, but there were enough extemists that the majority of Seekers who were murdered in the line of duty were murdered in Arrangement Systems. This could be the beginning of something that could make the Galaxy a lot safer for her people. 


""Miss Trei... Tree..Trie...Trii?  Where am I?""


""You don't remember?""


""No.. and if you can find my pants""


""We're at Chaste Cathy's Clean and Confidential Hotel on level 37 of Ven Spire. You said, and I quote ""take my money and give me the second cheapest room you've got, or I will find the most expensive thing in the lobby and rub her cute sexy gremlin ass all over it until it all explodes,"" while brandishing me at the staff.""


"".....I am soo sorry ma'am.""


""It was kinda romantic actually""


""Did I piss off your friends?""


""No, my pilot's jealous though.""


""What's your name?""


""Velawyr of the Brightglade Clan""


""Do I owe you money?""


""No""


""Do you need a doctor? Because what I had can kill a Cannidor at 10 paces so if you got any secondhand exposure-""


""The fumes from your breath got me pretty drunk but I'll be fine."" She says as she fishes for a small vial of pills in her bag. ""Sorry, these are formulated for Triii only.""


""It's fine, how did we meet?""


""See that diner across the street? They charged me ten times what it said on the menu, then after I finished my food they burned the furniture I sat on in the street to ""cleanse it of my filth.""  I might be dangerous but I clean myself. Hmph. Then you showed up, called them something offensive I didn't understand, and when they called you a stupid sheltered Tret skank and started throwing things at me you lifted me off the ground and hugged me.""


""Oh god the Admiral is gonna rip me a new one""


""...!...""


""Metaphorically. Now, where are-""


The piercing notes of Reveille played on a piccolo trumpet with sound amplification runes shake the room as the couple turn their heads to behold a Private Stream holding a rucksack and a paper bag. 


""Private Stream reporting in with a resupply sir!""


""Was the bugle really nessessary?""


""Critical sir!""


"".....""


""Critical to my morale sir, Mrs Fuzzy Lady,"" Deadpans the Phosa underneath who almost certainly had added some extra bit of sonic Axiom trickery to the trumpet call.


 Their replies are cut off by the perfectly timed ringing of two communicators, one from inside Velawyr's satchel and one from a pair of freshly laundered pants inside the rucksack. 


 ZB ducked into the bathroom to give Velawyr some privacy for her conversation and checked the communicator. *His* communicator. It's a number he didn't recognize, but one that was already in his contacts as ""Your Beautiful Chauffeur."" Streams....


""Good Morning, who do I have the pleasure of talking to?"" No hangover can beat Southern Manners.

 
""Hiya I'm Burna, Velawyr's pilot? She's been invited to the Dauntless and I'm supposed to pick her up, but I was given this number and her line is busy?""


""Nice to meet you, I'm Zane-Bob and I suppose I'm her boyfriend. She's just talking to someone else at the moment so I'll get her attention as soon as I can ma'am.""


""You know my fee is per Triii, right? The  insurance for you creepy fuzzballs is damn robbery. First ride is free for men but after that you're gonna have to pay.""


""Pardon me, but I'm Human? But if you're charging me at the non-Triii plus one fare I'll pay.""


""But you said,   oh.. I heard Humans were supposed to be immune but I didn't think you were THAT immune.""


""I'm gonna get Velawyr now, nice meeting you.""


He ducked back into the bedroom and waited on Velawyr to finish her conversation. 


""Nothing untoward happened! It's probably one of the best dates in my life if I'm honest.  I just wish hubby remembered more of it."" 


Velawyr put her hand on the speaker and whispered ""it's your commanding officer.""


""We'll climb the rest of this tree on the Dauntless, got it. I just need to contact my pilot.""


""About that, she's on the line"" said ZB while holding out his communicator to her. Her hand jerked back like he had offered her a lump of barbed wire.  


""Right where are my manners, I'll set it to speaker and clean up."" He carefully rested it on the cheap extruded plastic bedside table and grabbed the rucksack to make himself presentable. 


****


 Freshly showered, properly armed with 100% Triii proof gear and in a clean uniform, ZB joined a similarly refreshed but unarmed Velawyr and a telepresence drone projecting a holographic Ghob's face in the cabin of a moderately sized cargo ship. 


""So, this is Triii hangover food then?"" Asked ZB as he looked over the contents of the paper bag. Some sort of firm cheese with dried fruit inside that had been encrusted with seeds and roasted to a crispy exterior and gooey center. Pretty good, but more of a snack than a full meal.  


""Mpph hm..."" she took a drink of something that tasted like a mildly salted soymilk with mint blended into it. ""Perfect. Hows it taste to you hubby?""


""Vaguely like... pomegranates but with a raisin texture wrapped up in kinda mild tasting cheese like British Cheddar and covered in pumpkin seeds with the texture of poppyseeds. Also I mean no disrespect but we're not officially married yet.""


""By the Galaxy's standards we are in most places""


""Does that include the Triii?""


""We have no standards for Alien marriage.""


""Triii marriage?""


""The groom's Clan Matriarch and my father are supposed to negotiate for a month to determine the quality of the match and my ability to provide. Afterward we visit both extended families and make a formal announcement and update to the clan registries.""


""And if we skip all that?""


""The ceremony is meant to show that each clan respects and can work harmoniously with the other. To skip it means anything from a simple show of contempt to a veiled accusation of child abuse.""


""Child abuse, really?""


""If the bride's family snubs the groom's family, it implies that their son was saved from an abusive home.""


""And since a Triii wedding is impossible to attempt because of my family being in cruel space and us...  ""


""Being already wed?""


""Until we make things official, how about a human custom?""


Zane-Bob got out of the seat and got down on one knee in front of her, barely keeping steady as the ship wove through Centris traffic.


""Velawyr of The Brightglade clan, you are a beacon of sanity in the madness of the galaxy. You're cute, nice and for some reason have decided to accomodate a lunatic like me. Will you marry me?""


Her yes is muffled due the fact that her tongue is in his mouth while Burna's drone bangs its tyrite plated hands together in applause. 


""And now, you're my and I'm your fiance until we file the paperwork to get married.""


""Huh, lovers that just declare their intent to marry then wait for months??"" interjects Burna.  ""Why does such a short lived race that has so many men stretch out the process like that? ""


""Ghobs have  a natural lifespan of 50 years, your lives are short in both ways.""


""We're not in Cruel Space""


""You try living 80 years in Cruel Space.""


""Noo way, moving Triii around is the closest I'll go to that death pit.  Speaking of which, we're here.""


****


""Triii VIP inbound!""


Alien guests were shuffled to rooms where they would not able to sense her,  axiom based enhancements and hardware were powered down or moved entirely, and Triii sized furniture conspicously lacking any Axiom runes was moved into Admiral Cistern's office. All in the course of about 5 minutes.


""We recieved 1,037 complaints about chemical scanners that your Axiom Alcohol trick triggered. Your conduct has garnered 132 fines which you will pay in full. The Plates in Blue diner has banned you from the premises, as has Chaste Cathy's Clean & Confidential.

The Order of Denied Sainthood has threatened them with a counter-crusade should they attempt anything beyond that. And worst of all, your drunken nonsense could have endangered our relations with the Triii.""


""It won't happen again Admiral.""


""It had better not. Which brings me to the exceptional stroke of luck you've had. Madam Velawyr is quite enamored with you.""


""I am aware of that Admiral.""


""Phillip, can you please show Ms Velawyr back in here.""


""Thank you for your consideration Grand Admiral"" says Velawyr with a proper formal bow.


""Thank you for helping us reach an understanding with the Triii. The Triii have a need for Non-Triii outreach specialists. Tasks such as mediating disputes, hunting down the few Triii criminals, general negotiation and responding to Triii in distress. Velawyr has agreed to be a civilian consultant and Captain Lyve has sworn her oath to the EFL.""


""Will I be a Civillian Consultant for the Triii then?"" 


""Their equivalent is a bit more poetic, but essentially yes. You are on loose leash protocols, and should you choose to sign the contract the Triii have already sent you, a Kind Hand for the Triii.""


""Understood. May Humanity and the Triii be forever allied.""

* Total T: 1307 ng / dl
* Free T: 14.50 pg / ml (according to my lab, normal range is 5.40-40.10)
* SHBG: 79,4 nmol / L (normal range: 13.5 - 71.4)

All the other metrics (LH, FSH, Estradiol, Albumina, DHT, Prolactina) are in normal ranges, so it is safe to assume that the high SHBG is preventing the Free T to be released, right?

I've tried boron, 20mg per day per months, but it didn't do much, so I after reading some successful experiences from redditors I ended up buying some Proviron.

My question is: is there a rule of thumb of how much proviron might I need to decrease my SHBG? I am not interested in becoming a sexual predator, nor do I want to risk my hair, I am only interested in Proviron for its ability to reduce SHBG.

Also, is it OK if I take the Proviron powder directly in the coffee? With a micro spoon, I've been adding 20-30mg to the coffeee, because I bought the powder and preparing the pills is a pain in the ass.

I have liver disease (not due to eating or drinking habbits) which makes me feel very fatigued and tired in my daily life. I've tried many times to hit the gym and try to keep a steady rythm of going 2-3 times a week for an hour workout but i've been slacking lately due to tiredness and aching in my body.  
A lot of my days I wake up around noon and have a bowl of cereal, and then I don't eat anything until dinner. I drink decaf coffee about 6-8 mugs and I know that's a bad habbit but I guess it's my tradeoff for not smoking or drinking. On top of that, I'm a picky eater so cooking isn't really my forté.

I can eat unhealthy stuff but pretty much no matter what I eat, I maintain my weight and it doesn't move either way. 

What I am thinking of doing is counting calories cause from what i can tell from the app Lifesum, if I want to lose 10 KG by April, I need to consume about 2200 calories a day and exercise. 

How can I reach that amount of calories a bit easier? My friend was also overweight and gamer (I know, different bodies and physiques) and he told me he chose to drink chocolate milk every day to get enough calories to lose weight. Would something like that work for me if my problem is that I don't eat enough? 

I really do want to make a change and I want to see results. Cause I don't want this disease to keep holding me down and I want to get better and make better habbits.

Ever since leaving my abusive marriage and discovering my voice, it’s been a little... unfiltered. More so than usual. It’s like someone handed a megaphone to the little voice in my head that’s been quiet for years—it’s going to scream a bit.

I’ve been especially snappy with customer service staff. I mean, I understand they’re just doing their jobs, but when there are *five* people behind the counter and I’m still waiting *20 minutes* for my *fast food*? The math aint mathing. And when I’m standing at the counter like a  confused raccoon because no one told me my coffee is ready *across the room,* I can’t help but feel like customer service has gone down the drain. *(I want my double shot eggnog latte, STAT!)* 

I used to have a lot more patience with things like this. Laugh it off while thinking “They’ve probably already dealt with someone yelling about removing the gluten from their muffins.” You never know what someone has gone through or is going through that day. The last thing they need is an angry customer. I need to get better about waiting patiently, even when it seems stupid to do so.

Oh yes, I started a new job! My best friend also works there, pretty exciting, right? Ha. Wrong.  (No Yea... Working with her is honestly so great.) From the stories I’ve heard, I knew I was walking into a bit of a mess. But imagine walking along the beach expecting beautiful white sand between your toes but finding quicksand instead. Disorganized chaos doesn’t even begin to cover it. It’s like being handed a puzzle where half the pieces are chewed up, and the rest are just blank squares.

Spreadsheets with only numbers? No formulas, no formatting? That’s not a spreadsheet; that’s chaos. Multiple years of data on one sheet? Why stop there—why not throw in some ancient hieroglyphics too? And did I mention this is an *accounting role*? Accounting, the one job where you’d think people would be obsessed with neatness. Week 2, and I already feel like I need a ""World's Most Patient Person"" award for not flipping the desk. My kid has better organization skills, and she just shoves everything under her bed. 

Mantra of the day:

* I will have more patience.
* I will not question their skill sets (out loud).
* I will breathe deeply and whisper “Whooooooo Shaaaaaa” until I believe it.

Today is a new day... and if all else fails, at least there would be chocolate.

Having my morning coffee, about an hourish ago now, and see someone stop outside my driveway. Can't see them clearly, there's a bush there, but they idled and there's no reason to do so at that spot, a couple feet from my car. I step out and walk down and past the bush to see them standing with their hands framing the sun, staring directly at it, muttering. 

I greet them gently, I know this person. ""Morning, Chris. The sun is beautiful this morning, isn't it?""

""I KNOW I'M TAKING A PICTURE AHHH!"" Chris jerks their hands down and covers their eyes in pain. 

That's the last coherent thing they said and they sudden dropped to their knees in the street and started wailing/yelling about Jesus, sperm, people that want to kill them (Chris), they can't breathe, they're drowning in their sleep, they're cold, they're a millionaire and own this entire place, they're an African Elephant, they're possessed. It was a wild ride and it kept coming back to Jesus. 

In this time I tried to call their adult kid's cell, who was working, then an ambulance, then again the adult kid directly at work. The partner showed up within 10 minutes, at which point Chris became more aggressive, enraged, and said filthy, overtly sexual things. It took about 20 minutes for the ambulance to arrive and Chris's kid arrived 5 minutes later. Another 10 minutes of angry, terrified word salad with a lot of Jesus/God in it before they got Chris on a stretcher. Chuckling from the EMTs. Police show up a few minutes after, 2 of them, separate vehicles, then immediately leave after Chris's partner shambled over, embarrassed, and waved them on. 

I'm pretty shaken at the scene. Knowing why Chris can't get better. Knowing how they'll be treated at the local psych ward if they get admitted after the mandatory hold. Knowing they need to stay on medication but probably won't. We're lucky it hasn't been very cold yet. I worry about when the temperature actually drops and if they'll manage to get outside while everyone else is asleep.

On the television was a cop show. It was in English. Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man's legs or cut his hands to lace. On the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck themselves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last of his wine in the air.

She lives in a nice apartment ten minutes from us. She has an elderly cat she has been reluctant to vet due to costs. In the past, there have been several false alarms with the cat being deemed unwell by her.  Last time was a UTI we treated with antibiotics about a year ago. She is fluid with the truth (apparently doesn't want to look bad) so it is impossible to judge anything from talking to her. We take her out every weekend for dinner and to her appointments (she doesn't drive).  This weekend she mentioned in passing that the cat had something wrong with her leg and hadn't hit the litterbox with a poo (a cardinal sin). My Wife and I said she should see the vet and we would make an appointment.  No more.

The next day she calls in a panic.  She says the cat had a stroke or something and can't walk.  The cat has been overfed (was 20 lbs) to the point where walking is a HUGE challenge. Again, starts saying it's time for the cat to be catapulted across the rainbow bridge. My Wife and I go get the cat, thinking it's finally time apparently, but of course it's a Sunday so to the expensive ER vet we go with the poor kitty. We figure she needs to be examined at least anyways. We are both starving.  It's our usual night out for Sunday dinner.

We see the vet promptly.  They examine her and her blood pressure is SKY high and she is at least temporarily blind (hence the couldn't find her litter box) or more likely is permanently blind.  They do a quick ultrasound, but  nothing major on that so she isn't riddled with cancer. We discuss euthanasia, as the cat is at minimum going to need to be pilled daily the rest of her life, something my Mom has said she would NOT do before.  We clarified that the cat isn't in any pain and IF the loss of sight resolves it will be within a couple of weeks. Wife and I decided that we would medicate her for blood pressure and take her to her regular vet for additional blood work and potential euthanasia, as it would be a lesser expense at worst and the cat may recover but need medication at best.  I could go over daily to help. Frankly, I am loathe to put her down just for being blind, as long as she has a reasonable quality of life.  I am WFH, so she has taken up residence in a makeshift pen in my office with access to a TV my Mom usually left on for her for company.

I feared Mom would be disappointment we didn't 'do the dirty deed' so I told her everything over text (she was a teacher and is computer literate enough to use FB messenger but not a smart phone) but not that it was unlikely the cat would regain her sight.  While initially relieved, Mom jumped right to us bringing her home soon and asked how she is walking on hardwood floors (Mom's apartment is all hardwoods).  I said I hadn't assessed that and she wouldn't be going anywhere for a few weeks. She asked why weeks and I clarified that it takes two weeks on her current dose of amlodipine before the vet should adjust it and that she still doesn't look good and that her bp is probably still elevated. And that I would call first thing Tuesday (her vet is closed Mondays) for an appointment to get a bp measurement and get blood tests, at minimum.

She responded ""OMG this is so cruel!""  I responded that she is fine, besides being blind at the moment. She reiterated ""OMG!!! Cruel""  I responded ""Thanks for handling this so well. Goodbye.""  I relented and told her I hadn't had my coffee yet (true) and that I'd talk to her after call the vet.  I did so, texting that we have an appointment at noon.  She only responded ""Crying"" apparently because of my cruelty.  I reminded her that she raised me.

I really hope that someday I can work at another store that is kinder to its employees (or at least allows me to have a shift drink!!). But in the meantime, I’ll miss this place!",66,1732027902.0,starbucks,5,0.99,False

[Original BORU](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/s/wCyOanz2AT) 

New post will be marked with 🛑🛑🛑. 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/pafckaWFMh)  **Oct 21st, 2024** 

Can't believe I actually have a reason to post something on reddit, but here I am. 

My wife (41F) and I (42M) have been married for 15 years. 

I apparently surprised her by being capable of doing household chores and tasks, which I didn't think much of. My mom always asked me to help out with chores when I was a kid so I didn't think it was beneath me or anything. 

I do think I inherited her need to clean excessively, like it's so bad that I can't eat until a mess is dealt with. My Mom is an amazing cook, my Aunt was a literal chef at a fancy hotel and my dad loved having barbeques.  It was pretty natural to learn from them and pick up a thing or two. 

The only thing I didn't pick up was how to make a decent cup of tea or coffee, I'm genuinely awful at it. It got to a point where I was handling most of the household chores and taking care of cooking, which I prefer anyways since she comes home exhausted. 

I've been asking our children (11F and 9M) to do some minor tasks around the house and hopefully teach them this sort of thing too. She has a group of friends who hang out regularly, this time it was her turn to host the group at her home. 

I offered to take our children out for the day, and it was all set. Before we left, I had to finish up some things for work. The office space is practically on top of our living room, so I could hear what they were talking about the entire time. 

One of the friends asked how she always kept our house so spotless and my wife just bragged about how she was responsible for it all. 

Then they all started talking about their gripes with their marriages, a common theme was how unhelpful their spouses were. I felt pretty uncomfortable so I just left the office and went out with the kids. 

I came back after they had left for the night and acted as normal until we got to our bedroom. I asked her what was up with that conversation they had and pointed out that I did the cooking and cleaning in our marriage. 

She told me not to take it personally, and that she just wanted to fit in with the struggles of her friends. Now I just feel unappreciated, especially since I don't clearly remember any genuine gratitude for what I do from her. 

Since then, she's been pretty short with me. She says I'm weaponizing what I'm doing against her and holding it over her head. 

I don't expect her to compliment me each time I clean or defend me religiously, just a little 'My husband is pretty helpful actually, he does his share' would be nice. I can't help but feel like her friends think I'm some sort of deadbeat who comes home to relax and neglect her. 

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/z1gCjKoaRj)  **Oct 23rd, 2024** 

I'm pretty shocked this post went as viral as it did, and I tried my best to speak to my wife yesterday. 

I just can't believe that this is the woman I married. I tried speaking with her, telling her that what she did wasn't that big of a deal but was still not a nice thing to do. 

She didn't like me bringing it up again and just told me to suck it up and stop 'bitching' about one mistake. She apologized, but in a tone that just sounded like she was just tired of dealing with this. 

I noticed her getting very heated and on the verge of starting an argument so I backed off and switched to a different topic. I asked if we could adjust our duties at home to be more fair for both of us, since most of our management fell to me. 

(I mean pretty much 90% of things like cooking/cleaning, including planning for our date nights or vacations for our family rely on me. I do think it's an issue that she gets to come home and just tell me that she's tired.) 

Then she got up in my face, telling me I had no right to lecture her about chore duties when I'm practically at home most of the time. She completely refused to hear me out and basically told me that what we have works best for our situation. 

She threw me in my face that she was the money-maker and that balanced everything out in the end. Even this morning she was pretty annoyed with me, coming downstairs in a bad mood. 

I'm very sure our kids noticed it too but I drove them to school after they got ready. When I got back I noticed that my wife left her packed lunch on our kitchen counter. 

So now I'm sitting here, just feeling like the woman I've known for 15 years hates me. 

I guess I'll have to push this issue properly even if she gets angry. She's been ignoring my texts and attempts to call her. 

I can't just let her act like this, especially in front of our children.


[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/i3R4FB1MZ8)  **Oct 24th, 2024** 

I think I'm just done at this point. 

I did something I never did before and went into her phone while she slept. We both know each others passwords, so it wasn't really difficult. Some of the cheating comments got to me and I felt pretty paranoid about this situation. 

Instead I found a group chat with some of her work friends (different from the other friends she had over). It was just non-stop mockery of me and some of the stuff I did for her. 

She told them how embarrassed she feels to be with me and that I dote on her like a parent and don't feel like her husband. The lunches I pack for her are 'humiliating' because I add sweets and other treats I know she likes. 

Some of her coworkers teased her about the snacks I have in for her and she admitted to just throwing them out at work. She doesn't have any issue eating them at home, but at work she throws out my baking? 

She had some choice words to say about me in her chat, some of which I don't have the courage to type out here. One of her meme pictures was of me on my knees scrubbing a bathroom tile, edited to have some sort of dress on like I was some sort of housewife from the 1960's or something. 

I just closed her phone and left the bedroom. 

I confronted her about the chat in the morning and the contents of it which got her panicking. I focused on our kids this morning and left her to her own devices, it's not like she would have appreciated a 'Kids lunch' anyways. 

Now she's texting me like crazy at the office, but I think I lost all respect for her and what she's become. Not only does she find me overbearing and embarrassing as a husband, but then I find out she mocks me to her friends and exposes some sensitive relationship issues to her group chat. 

This will probably be the last update, since I don't think she can come back from this. We'd just celebrated our 15th anniversary last month too, I feel like a loser now after seeing what my wife actually thinks of me. 

***Added comments***

>We both work, she makes about 100k a year while I make around 70k.
She earns more but she's definitely not the only income in our household. 

>What makes my job great is that my boss lets me have a lot of flexibility, so I can work from home and take care of the house and kids as long as I give him a heads up. 

🛑🛑🛑. 
[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/ta1talxw1j)  **Nov 12th, 2024** 

**Final Update: AITA for bringing up just how much I do for our household to my wife?** 

I know I'm going to get some hate for my decision at the end of this all, but I gave my wife one more chance. 

She gave me a real apology for her actions and how she treated me about two weeks ago. In her own words, she let her friend's comments at work and her best friends affect her too much. 

My wife wanted to feel included in the groups by playing both sides, one that has a useless husband and one that has a clingy husband. She's not using them as an excuse and did take full responsibility for how poorly she treated me which is a plus. 

She suggested some sort of Marriage counselling for us and insisted on doing the planning herself to show me she's dead serious on wanting to make this work. She's copied me in her communications with a counsellor, but it'll still be a while before our first appointment. 

She's stepped up in the home too, doing more tasks without me asking. The compliments I used to get have also made a return, so I do feel a little more appreciated. 

My wife promised me that she wouldn't lie to her friend group anymore and give me the credit I deserve. 

The work friends I don't know about, their opinions on me will forever be as they are even though she talked to them. 

Part of this feels disingenuous, since it took us getting into a bad spot for this to happen. Maybe it's just resentment talking. 

I just hope this works out for our sake and the kids. 

And no, she has not been cheating or had some guy in her ear telling her things. A lot of DM's are asking about that.

1guyvhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergy/comments/1guyvhp/allergy_experience_could_you_help/,"Allergy experience, could you help?","Yesterday I had a bad allergy experience. I woke up and had a red swollen left eye, got a coffee, then slowly started feeling itchier and itchier all over my face and neck, very patchy red and having pretty instant watery diarrhea (sorry if tmi, i'm just trying to be accurate). I'm actually tracking everything I'm eating and drinking at the moment but it's still working out what would have caused it. But it was clearly something from the previous day.

The day previous to the allergy issue we lifted the floorboards and went in the attic and found there was rat droppings in both areas, we had been hearing gnawing and scurrying so finally had a look. So one of my theories is it being in the air and having a severe allergy to rats or their leavings after lifting the floorboards.

The second thought is I have been wondering if I have an allergy to olive oil. But sometimes I have it and I don't notice an issue or much of one and sometimes I'm feeling there's a pattern where it affects me strongly, which could be from the amount of olive oil used. So for the meal I had the day before I had oven cooked carrots heavily slathered in olive oil.

Would it likely be a reaction to the food given stomach upset? 

Also, could I test olive oil allergy by applying directly to my skin and then see if a reaction appears? Or would this not work because it would be an allergen I have consumed so applying it would not work?
Which do you think is the most likely suspect out of the two? Rats or olive oil?

I've had chronic eczema for most my life and never had stomach problems with it but it felt very linked to how severe my skin reacted, waking up with a swollen eye and then gradually my face becoming more and more itchy. My face has been pretty well behaved recently apart from this fairly severe reaction.

I had actually taken an antihistamine (cetirizine) that night to help me sleep so I do wonder how severe my reaction would have been if I hadn't have taken that before sleep.",1,1732027820.0,Allergy,0,1.0,False

Located in the Jeff Davis County of Texas, Fort Davis is a census-designated place that houses unincorporated communities. This small town has a population of 1000 residents and it is also the county seat of Jeff Davis County. This census-designated place is known for its small-town vibe, breathtaking scenery and some well-known touristy attractions. The town is also infamously known for the war of the 1880s that claimed several lives. Being a resident of Fort Davis, Texas, you must have to explore coffee shops, breweries, restaurants and art galleries that showcase the different cultures of this region. Fort Davis is a growing town and as a result, there are several ongoing development projects. Further, businesses are also flourishing in this town with the growing population mandating the need to hire strong and well-trained security guards. Running a business is highly risky and for its smooth operations, you must hire [**armed security guards in Fort Davis, Washington**](https://accesssecurityguardwashington.com/)**.**

**How do armed security guards in Fort Davis, Washington protect a business?**

● Protecting the valuable information of a business: A business usually stores its entire information regarding its assets, liabilities, debts, income, etc electronically. Information theft has also become quite common now. Criminals steal a business’s confidential information causing immense damage to a business. **Security guard services** work day and night to protect this information from being stolen.

● Surveillance of a business premise: There are a lot of visitors that visit a business premise during working hours for different purposes. Armed **security guard services** keep a check on these visitors and run a security check on them before granting them access to the business premises. A security guard also deploys CCTV cameras to help them in surveillance of the business premises. This prevents dishonest employees from committing a crime.

● Protecting employees and workers of a business: [**Armed security guards in Fort Davis, Washington**](https://accesssecurityguardwashington.com/security-guard-services/) also protect the employees and workers of a business from any kind of emergencies. When these workers feel safe and secure they feel enthusiastic and put in extra effort at work. This increases the overall productivity of a business enterprise.

**Which company provides the best Armed security guards in Fort Davis, Washington?**

An armed security guard has permission to keep and use a licensed weapon which makes it more dangerous than an unarmed one. However, hiring armed security is more expensive and they should be appointed in high-risk areas such as business. If you are also planning to hire **armed security guards in Fort Davis, Washington** for your business then you should try Access Control Security (ACS). ACS has a strong priority towards their customers and only hires licensed and trained security personnel. The best part of hiring ACS is that their professionals are highly skilled and rigorously trained.

For more information on Access Control Security visit the [Access Control Security website](https://accesssecurityguardwashington.com/) or contact 877–482–7324.",1,1732027446.0,u_SillySchedule9782,0,1.0,False

1guyq7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concerta/comments/1guyq7v/im_almost_unable_to_function_anymore_help/,I'm almost unable to function anymore. HELP!!,"So, I started taking Concerta 36 mg in January of 2023. Before that I was on generic Methylphenidate, 15 mg in the morning, as soon as I woke up, and 15 mg after lunch. I wasn't taking the treatment with the generic drug seriously as I should, mainly due to its ups and downs, a trademark of generic instant-release Ritalin. Since the summer of 2019(when I was diagnosed and prescribed the drug), I was in and out of treatment all the time, coz some days the crashes and other stuff were too much to handle.


So, one day, I had a long talk with my doctor. He finally convinced me, and at last I decided to migrate to Concerta, an expensive move to be sure, however, worth the price, once it granted me a smoother experience.


So far so good, some adjustments here and there, like the introduction of Propranolol for instance, which helped a lot with anxiety and irritability, booster dosages with the generic drug if and when they were necessary, having several alarm clocks remembering me that I should stop whatever I was doing right away and hydrate myself and/or eat, even if the appetite wasn't there, the total and complete exclusion of any alcohol or caffeine intake from my diet.


This served me well for almost a couple of years now. Fair and square. Before starting Concerta 36 mg, I was already on Lexapro/Escitalopram (a well-known and well-tolerated SSRI), 20 mg daily, for some 6 or 7 years. That had to be adjusted to 10 mg daily or else it would interact with Concerta and give me insomnia, coz yes, Methylphenidate also acts blocking the reuptake of serotonin, tho it's regarded as a weak drug as such, but nonetheless, the pharmacology of this phenomena is well known.


Time went by, I used to take drug holidays when possible, however I figured so much more could be done also during the weekends if I took the medication. I'd be always up to date with my reading for instance, and well... All the rest(after all, this is an ADHD subreddit, so you guys must know already what I'm talking about...).


At some point, I was feeling... Well... Depressed again, as I had not felt in a long time. My doctor then insisted I should up my Lexapro/Escitalopram daily intake from 10 mg, back to 20 mg, for a few days and observe the result. Well, somehow it worked, and I wasn't getting the dreaded insomnia anymore, I guess my system was already used to Concerta at this point, and it didn't bothered a little more serotonin available in the synaptic cleft.


However... The Headaches... I had to learn to tolerate them almost every day. The Propranolol was there(40mg twice a day), and my blood pressure checked just fine. So I decided to lower the Lexapro/Escitalopram dosage to 10 mg again on my own. Well, that did the trick, but...


I would wake up, take my Concerta 36 mg + Lexapro 10 mg and start the day. On some days I'd take Propranolol as well, on others I wouldn't, just to check if it would have any effect on the outcome whatsoever. From here on, everything would feel nice for about 1 to 2h, and then, my “energy level”, or “will to power”(as much as I dislike this expression…), my “tenacity” to face the challenges that the new day brings, would all of the sudden go down like a brick, just fall flat. No energy, it feels like even blinking my eyes requires a huge effort, concentration level equals zero, it becomes even hard to text on the phone. It just feels like I want to close my eyes and go back to sleep...


What would be the natural thing that stupid me would do as that happens? Pour some coffee and generic 10 mg boost dosages over the problem, obviously... And obviously it doesn't solve anything, on the contrary, it will seem work for a few minutes until we are back to square one. 


Insisting on that(more caffeine, more 10 mg or 5 mg boost dosages) will only get you an infernal headache, involuntary teeth-grinding and jaw-clenching, irritability like you never felt before, the sensation your chest is going to burst, aching muscles(a kind of pain very similar to when you overuse them), diarrhea(specially if you added caffeine to the mix), awful nausea(like you're ready to throw up something, but nothing comes out...), insomnia at the end of the day, and so on... And you will still be feeling sleepy on top of that, but unable to sleep. I believe insisting on this stupidity, can get pretty dangerous, and no one in their right mind should try more than two or three boost dosages, before exercising the better part of value.


It all came to a point where it's difficult, if not impossible, to function like I used to. Of course it didn't start happening at a specific date all at once, but rather evolving in the course of 3 to 4 weeks. I have an appointment with my doctor in January 2025, by the end of the month. I believe it has been difficult to get a hold of a psychiatrist in many countries, and here it hasn't been different. I don't know if upping the Lexapro dosage back to where it was would restore some functionality to my day, of if the trouble is something different altogether.


I'm feeling... afraid... I'm afraid that this product and its formulation that restored my believe in medication-driven ADHD treatment wont work anymore for me. I had basically two years of peace, productivity and quiet, which really helped with my self-stem, and portfolio, and now I fear for the future. Of course you may have already realized I'm terribly afraid of becoming a junkie. When I didn't know what my problem was, I had terrible experiences with benzos(dependency, tolerance), and those are always there in the background, terrorizing me.


I'm open to suggestions and also if you feel comfortable to share your experiences here with me/us, please do! And if you don't, you can send me a private message. I thank you all very much, and I apologize for my anxiety and nervousness. I think some people here will sympathize.

I don’t know how much more I can take. It takes such a toll on me this pain it ravages my mind and body and i just keep pushing through.

I will email my therapist and see if she has time for extra time this week because there’s just too much to talk about

I need to rest but there is no rest there is only pain. Even without the ruminating and the self blame and even knowing what this is and why, the pain is still incredibly intense.

1guypg6,https://i.redd.it/uru68lemev1e1.png,Layout Help - 4 doors and a fireplace,"I recently bought a flat and this living room layout has left me completely stumped. There are two doors on the right hand side of the floor plan going into two separate hallways, one double glass door (bottom of floor plan) leading into the garden and acting as the only window and a doorway (left hand side of floor plan) leading into the kitchen. There's also a fireplace (bricked up, but still going into the room), meaning there is basically no wall space. 

The previous owner had 3 different armchairs spread around the room in each corner, but I'd ideally like a sofa (no longer than 2 metres), armchair, coffee table, TV, bookshelves and a small dining table, which I feel should be possible given the size of the room? 

Every layout I've tried seems cramped or blocks one of the doors. It would be possible to move the doorway to the kitchen (or remove the wall entirely, but I'm not the biggest fan of an open plan kitchen/living room).

Hiiii girlies, LYSM! Been a listener since S2 and a big ballin bitch 🫶🏼 you’re a household name at this point 😂 anywayyyyy gonna stay anonymous (she/her) for this one, but am I missing something?!? (All names have been changed).

I had a college class with a girl, let’s call her Rachel. We got assigned a group project and she was a disappointment to work with… another student and I basically did the majority of the work and she floated off our success. Whatever, moved on, but should’ve been my first red flag. Next semester we had another class together and she was the only person I knew so I said hi. She instantly connected with me and was overly nice so I rolled with it. We’d get coffee and lunch between classes and a friendship formed. She was dating a guy and ended up going through a weird breakup, she’d come over and we’d share some wine and I was there for her through it all. She ended up leaving the guy to be with another guy, Jeff, that was heavily pursuing her, sending gifts to her work (singing telegrams, flowers, food, etc). It all happened so fast, but she seemed really happy. A few years later they get married. She asked me to be a bridesmaid. She is from a different country and planned on two different weddings, one for her nationality and one American. Because the one bridesmaid couldn’t make it to the first wedding, none of us were invited to that wedding. She never ended up having the American wedding. It was disappointing but I understood and moved on from it. Then I had a baby. She was one of the first people to meet my son. Her and her husband have had years of infertility so I know it was hard but she was extremely doting on him and super supportive of me. Was even aunt Rachel to not only him but my second child as well. 

Her husband has a sister, we’ll call her Jo. A couple years ago Jo moved to be closer to the city and her brother after a horrendous breakup. The three of them did everything together and from the outside looking in they appeared to have the perfect friendship. When we’d all go out to brunch or when they came over to hang, Jo was usually with them. At first Jo was quiet and Rachel is extremely outgoing so we were all friendly but there wasn’t a huge connection. We sell products that they would all come over and pick up from us when we were hanging out. Eventually Jo started coming over to pick it up by herself. She never stayed, it was always quick, but I truly enjoyed her personality and energy. One day I hosted a Sunday funday and invited Rachel and Jo. Rachel ended up getting drunk and crying about not being able to conceive (this was a regular occurrence at this point) and while my heart truly breaks for her, it happened every time she drank and she has a habit of making every thing about her, every social situation about her, it’s always main character energy. I consoled her, comforted her and she ended up sobering up and went home to be with her husband. The weight we all felt lift from the air when she left was palpable. I was worried about her so I kept reaching out and she wouldn’t answer. I almost drove over to her house when she finally texted later that night that she was ok. Jo tried calling her when she left a couple and she answered, only to tell Jo she thought her husband had unalived himself because when she got home he wasn’t there and he wasn’t answering his phone. Mind you, Rachel appears to be vulnerable with me, but really isn’t. After all our years of friendship and myself being completely open with her, I found out a lot of stuff she has never shared with me (like emotionally cheating on her husband twice). I felt a little betrayed because I thought we were more honest with each other and I’ve held nothing back. She likes to appear like she has it all together, but in reality there’s a lot more going on. Anyway, Jo called me to tell me that Rachel had thought that happened, was in a panic, and had called Jo and Jeff’s parents to tell them. Jo flipped out on her, especially after he showed up moments later with food. When I tell you she can be dramatic… she can! But honestly I was just glad everyone was ok. And again, moved on. 

At this point Jo and I realized we had a great friendship connection and started hanging out on our own. There was less drama, we could actually hold a conversation without getting interrupted or the focus being taken away from us. It’s so cliche but we just VIBED. We weren’t even going behind her back, but Rachel accused us of doing just that. We’d make plans that would happen to be when Rachel wasn’t free and she took this as us leaving her out. Jo had moved here to get away from a toxic ex and friendships and knew no one besides us and her coworkers, yet Rachel told her to find her own friends… Jo was so hurt by this. I was so disappointed to hear this. Nobody likes a mean girl and not being inclusive is not my vibe. I had a conversation with Rachel explaining to her that we were like family and she didn’t need to worry about anyone coming between us and that I was confused why she had an issue with me befriending her sister in law. She “got over it” and we seemed to all move on. We ended up keeping our hang outs from this point forward a secret because we just didn’t wanna deal with the drama. Then she found out we went to a show together, and even though I explained to Rachel it was sold out and our other friend had the extra tickets, she was pissed. She took both of us out to brunch separately and again I had to have a tough conversation with her and defend myself as to why I’m being friends with her SIL 🙄 thought it was behind us again, but Rachel slowly started pulling away again. Honestly I wasn’t that upset about it because it felt a little relieving?? I felt bad that after a decade of friendship I was ok with it?? The icing on the cake was when Jo ordered tickets for me, herself, my husband and another friend to go to another show and she wasn’t invited. She went radio silent on all platforms and I haven’t talked to her since. She was constantly liking, commenting, messaging me and it all stopped at once. Yet, she proceeds to engage with all of my friends that she has either met once or has talked mad shit about. And after she told her SIL to find her own friends… maybe she should take her own advice 😂 I know she is pissed, but I can’t live my life to appease her. It’s been 4 months with no communication. I had to mute her stories and posts because it was getting to me. 

Sorry this was an actual novel, and I didn’t even touch on half the stuff she’s done that are red flags 🚩 I’m not sure how to move forward with this, maybe I’m the asshole, but AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

1guyfxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1guyfxv/dreams_of_hyacinth/,Dreams of Hyacinth,"Nicholas North ran down the alley, diving over refuse bins and rolling under gates. He could hear the shouts of the Houndstooth Customer Safety Engineers in pursuit. As he rounded a corner and burst out from the covered alley into a crowded street, Nick nearly slipped on the wet sidewalk, slick from the rain. Regaining his footing quickly, he hoped the rain would help conceal him from the CSEs chasing him. Slowing his breathing and flipping his collar up, he tried to blend in with the crowd of commuters heading home.

  


The first time Nick stepped foot onto High Mars Hyacinth, he was surprised at the weather. The Orbital was so large that the huge volume of air high above him had room for the water cycle to continue. There would be clouds and then rain and then the sun of Sol would shine through the transparent gaps in the arms, warming everyone, and the cycle would begin anew. It was a small bit of planetary life here high above Mars. Now though, rainy days dragged him down. He was in space, on an Orbital high above the Graveyard of the Billionaires. It shouldn't be raining.

  


Like the locals, Nick called Mars the Graveyard of the Billionaires. Long in the past, some people with more wealth than sense back on Earth attempted to colonize the surface of Mars and remake it into a capitalist paradise.

  


If failed.

  


Tens of thousands of people died in the attempt, and in the end, the billionaires were murdered in their half completed colony domes by their employees, who they were very careful to point out were legally distinct from slaves. These days, nobody even remembers *which* billionaires it was. Just that they were stupid, killed thousands, and died for it.

  


Nick dared to glance back into the crowds as he approached the metro. He could see the white uniforms of the CSEs looking around, their drones hovering two heads taller than they were, scanning people. Even this far back, the whine of the drone cast a pall over the crowds. They knew what that noise meant. They were too far back to notice him though; it looks like Nick got away… this time. Selkirk would give him a hard time, but at least she probably wouldn’t be mad.

  


Nick walked with the crowd as they entered the metro station and the thronged mass of people flowed like water down the stairs and escalator to the platform. As Nick reached the turnstile, he palmed a little handmade device and touched it to the reader. With a satisfied beep, the turnstile opened and admitted him. He didn't know whose account he was using; it cycled through tens of thousands of purloined accounts.  If it was a different, random one every time the chances of getting discovered was that much lower. He got it from Eastern a few weeks ago. He had no idea where she got it from, but knew better than to ask.

  


Nick didn't like use the device that much anyway. He preferred to walk on the surface, but sometimes you did what you had to do. Hyacinth was too large to walk from end to end unless you were out to do it just for the sake of doing it. The current record was something like twenty hours. Most tourists did it over two or three days.

  


High Mars Hyacinth was old. 

  


Built before humans mastered gravity, before they mastered wormhole travel, even before they launched their mighty colony ships and settled other worlds, Hyacinth was an antique. Made in the style of an O'Neil Cylinder, It was 96.5 kilometers long and 32.1 kilometers wide. The numbers weren't nice and round because Hyacinth was so old it was built using the Old Measures. Sixty Miles by Twenty Miles.

  


Rotating slowly to use centripetal force to borrow a feeling like gravity, Hyacinth had six arms that soared away from the ""bottom."" Three were habitation and three were mirrored to help reflect the sun into the Orbital and give a kind of day-night cycle. The Habitation arms kept parallel to themselves, and the mirrored arms would swing wider and narrower to direct sunlight into the Orbital. Originally powered by solar collectors and old-style fission reactors, these days Hyacinth used the same type of reactors as the Starjumpers and Colony ships, just a larger version of them. Centuries ago, gravity generators were installed as well. Hyacinth doesn’t spin anymore.

  


Out of a sense of paranoia, Nick rode two stops past his usual stop and got off with everyone. It was a major hub station at the 'bottom' of the arm and one or the first ones people would see when they disembarked from their ships, so it was full of people not familiar with the area, walking slowly trying to make sense of the labyrinthine metro system. That combined with the commuters in a hurry to go home, Nick felt more hidden and made his way to the surface.

  


Touching his ticket emulator with the purloined identity to the exit turnstile - making sure it was the same user he used for in *and* out - Nick exited the metro station and looked around. Congregation Square, at the very bottom of Hyacinth. If Nick turned around, behind him would be the base the arms connected to, which houses the docking rings for ships as well as most of the large scale mechanicals for the orbital. Reactors, water and air purifiers, things like that. At the base of the arms, was the administration buildings and embassies, and then Congregation Square itself. Down here, looking out towards the arms was odd. Further up the arms, it was easier for his brain to pretend he was on a planet and not worry about the odd horizon. Close to the base, it felt like he was staring at a gigantic circular building when he looked at Administration.

  


The rain had tapered off by the time Nick got off the metro, and now everything was hot and moist. Doing his best to walk purposefully without looking like he was escaping something, he made his way across the square to a coffee stand sitting on the edge of the square. 

  


""Nick! What the hell are you doing down here? I only ever see you in Laurel. What are you doing in civilization?"" Laughing, the coffee vendor was doing his best to express surprise at seeing Nick, but also enough familiarity with him so that he would be recognized as one of his regulars - ideally, enough to tip generously at the flattery. 

  


Nick looked around, and then at the coffee vendor. He was an old human, with dark skin and a shock of curly white hair on the top of his head. ""Hey, Ambrose. Is this where I can find you when you're not in Laurel Square?""

Ambrose nodded, his hair bobbing gently. ""On Mondays and Fridays yes.  Tuesday and Thursday I'm in Laurel, Wednesday is my day off, and I spend the weekend in Gladiolus.""

  


Nick smiled. ""Well then, it must be kismet that we met. Let's do something special. How about a Flat White?""

  


""Sure thing Nick, what's your dairy today? The usual oat?”

  


Nick shook his head. ""Nah, something special today. To commemorate a... success. Let's go with cow.""

  


As he bustled to get the espresso ready Ambrose stopped. ""You sure Nick? Real mammal dairy costs.""

  


Nick waved his hand dismissively. ""I said I'm celebrating, didn't I? Cow milk Ambrose. You know it's the only one for the best micro foam in a flat white."" Nick placed two plastic bills and a small plastic chit on the counter. Cash for Ambrose, the chit for the coffee.

  


Almost faster than they eye could follow, the money disappeared behind the counter. As Ambrose worked and the pressure built for the espresso, a group of 5 tiny steam whistles sang like a tiny calliope. Everyone who knew Ambrose's coffee cart knew the song.

  


Ambrose pulled the shot and then quickly blasted boiling steam through the real milk. The sound and scent of the milk was familiar and nostalgic to Nick.  Beef is a vital export of Parvati, so when Nick was young he was never far from bovines, and cow's milk is his favorite.  The price on Hyacinth normally stops him from getting it regularly, but Nick really wanted to have his flat white just the way he remembered.

  


Ambrose slid over the coffee in a paper cup and the chit with it. The cash was long gone.

  


""Thanks Ambrose, I'll see you next week.""

  


""Take care of yourself Nick. I'll keep the cow milk open and chilled for another 5 days. You can have another drink at a discount, so I don't waste it.""

  


Nick raised the coffee in salute and turned away and walked across the square. He took a careful sip. It was *almost* just like how he remembered it from his childhood on the colony. The coffee grown on Parvati had a different terroir as the Terran coffee, but it was as close as he was going to get unless he spent six months rent on importing some Parvati Gold.

  


As Nick walked along sipping his coffee and staying off the main roads, his phone buzzed, and his headset projected the caller ID onto his eyeballs. It was Selkirk.

  


""Hey Sel, what's up?""

  


Sel had video turned on, so in Nick's upper left of his vision he saw a small image of his K'laxi friend. She had grey white fur and her right ear had a large notch out of it. The other ear was nearly completely covered in silver earrings which would flash and shine in the sun. Below her notched ear is an artificial eye surrounded by a deep, old scar. ""Don't give me that false confidence, Nick! You were supposed to check in an hour ago and now I see you walking around Congregation with a coffee?""

  


""Sel, Sel, everything is fine. Better than fine really, Chrome. I ran into some CSEs and had to lose them in the Metro. I rode down here and found that's where Ambrose goes when he's not in Laurel. Got a coffee to celebrate and I'm making my way back now. No stress Selkirk, no stress.""

  


""Yes stress Nicholas, *yes*."" Sel flicked her ears with irritation, and he could hear the jingle of her earrings over the call. Or was it worry? ""Did you get it?""

  


Nick nodded and took another sip of coffee. ""Course I did.""

  


*It* was in his coat pocket, and the feeling of it was much heavier than its actual mass.

  


""Get back up here then Nick, We gotta hand it over to Eastern before we get paid. You know how she gets when we're late.""

  


He winced when he mentioned Eastern. He *did* know exactly how she gets when they're late. He also remembered that he still kind of sort of owes her for the ticket emulator still. ""I'm headed back up now, Sel. I'll be there in an hour, hour and a half. I don't want to draw attention to myself by hustling, and I want to stay out of the Metro.""

  


The moment he stopped speaking, Eastern's voice could be heard. ""I hear your delaying tactics, Nicholas North and they aren't going to work on me. I'm running a timer and for every *second* over one hour you are getting deducted an additional 1%.""

  


Selkirk just looked at Nick through the call. Her ears flicked again.

  


""Ancestors Sel, I wish you told me I was on speaker. Hi Eastern, what's up?""

  


""Your ass, unless you hustle Nick. Don’t think I forgot about the ticket emulator too.”

  


""Pleasant as always Eastern, I'll see you soon."" Nick disconnected the call.

Nick finished his flat white and tossed the cup into the trash. If he kept on the meandering path he was taking now, his phone said it would take him seventy five minutes to get back to Selkirk. If he moved back to the main street, he could cut it down almost in half to forty five. Even shorter if he took the omnibus. 

  


""Ugh, fine."" Nick turned left and walked over to the main street. As he approached, an electric omnibus clattered and buzzed towards him, the overhead pantograph giving off an ozone smell. Cycling another identity with his emulator, he palmed it onto the reader and the doors opened. Stepping aboard, he smelled the hot electric motor, the rubber tires and the masses of people aboard. The electric omnibus was much cheaper than the Metro though it was a good deal slower. That suited Nick much better than the expensive and much more heavily guarded Metro.

  


He stood in the middle of the omnibus, hooking his elbow around a pole while he read the news projected onto his eye from his pad. Nick's world was decidedly small in the grand scheme of things, but he still liked to hear about what was going on elsewhere. The Provisional Venusian government looks like they were voting to drop provisional from their title later this year. After their emperor was ousted... and then the *next* Empress was ousted by the AIs, Venus decided that maybe having royalty run them wasn't really something they wanted to do anymore. It was getting too expensive to rebuild the floating cities. Nick had no skin in their game, but he wished them luck. He wasn't in Sol when that whole business with Empress Melody happened a decade back or so, but he asked some old timers about it once when he was curious and anyone that actually had an opinion had figured she was nice enough and that the AI faction was too harsh.

  


Before too long, Nick reached his stop, just outside of Laurel Square. He pressed on the tape that ran along the top of the omnibus to signal a stop, and as the vehicle rattled and clattered to a stop be pressed his palmed emulator to the reader and the back door hissed open.

  


Stepping out into the moist and misty evening, Nick started down the alley towards the meeting place. ",22,1732026659.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

I hope it makes things easier to follow. I can't sit down and observe a rigid structure; I have to follow what the demons in my head tell me, as they tell it to me.

So if it seems unnecessarily convoluted, blame those fuckers. I do.

----------------

It was with a nearly cavalier movement that I plucked the note from the ground next to his hand, lifting it to the light and adjusting my bifocals so that I could read the reason that my grandson had been murdered.

>We can change your mind.

I stood still.

I think we all imagine moments of sudden death to be filled with high drama. Maybe we've seen too many movies. But I just stood still in the splash of sunlight that streamed through the window. The clock ticked.

I walked, dazed, to the kitchen. I made some chamomile tea.

I don't know why.

Looking back over many years, I've been able to piece together some of the broken shards of my mind and heart. The simple fact is that we cry when things are bad, and fall into deep, soul-shaking sobs when they're at their worst. But in that moment, I had shattered so deeply that there was no vision of trying to address the world in a way that a crying person does. Tears are designed to process pain, to go through it with the unspoken hope of something close to wholeness on the other side.

But when I saw my dead grandson, I no longer had any illusion of hope. I would never be whole again, and my family was gone forever.

Grandma had nothing left to lose.

I truly have no idea how long I sat there. I could believe ten seconds; I could believe a day and a half.

I eventually looked at the clock to see that it was 7:13 p. m. That’s when I realized two things with the casual inevitability of observing a clock. The first was that it was time for me to die. The second was that I wanted to maximize how many of my grandson’s killers I took down to hell with me. 

I wasn’t afraid, because fear is rooted in the potential damage of losing the irreplaceable. But for the woman who had nothing, there was nothing that could make me afraid. 

Brushing Michael’s toys aside, I lifted his room-temperature body and carried him to the back door. The only thought running through my head was that he was so much lighter than I would have expected; every time I used to touch or tickle him, my grandson would writhe with life. I wasn’t prepared for the sensation of nothing but gravity pulling back. 

I left his body sitting in the shade by the garden. It's where we were when I told him that his mother had died, and it seemed only fitting.

Then I went back inside and called the number that the man in the gray suit had left me. My dazed mind had no recollection of him giving it to me; my subconscious had taken over at this point, knowing the steps I needed to get to the very end.

He picked up on the first ring.

“You can have my tea shop.”

*

I sealed every window with caulk. Finding the right line behind the walls was tricky, though

Yet I had nothing but time on my hands.

*

I didn't rise from the couch when the three men arrived.

“Regardless of what happened in the past, I hope we all take the easiest path going forward,” said the man in the gray suit.

I nodded once.

He placed the sharp-looking briefcase on the coffee table. “$50,000.” He looked at me seriously. “I'm a man of my word.”

I nodded again.

He snapped his fingers. The smaller of his two followers marched quickly forward and opened a binder, placing it on the coffee table between us. The larger, silent companion clutched a large duffel bag close to his chest. “We can transfer ownership right now. Once we're done, you'll pick up what you can carry and leave.” The man across from me folded his arms. “We'll clean up the tea shop.”

His two underlings sat across one another in oversized armchairs, looking exhausted. 

“Won't you have some tea?”

The man in the gray suit stared at me in surprise. “I'm not sure that you understand the gravity of your situation.”

“I'm just trying to be a good hostess.” I licked my lips. “Grandmas love tea.”

“If you elect to make this exit difficult, I will return to intense measures.” He glanced at where I had found Michael on the floor.

I leaned my head back against the couch and closed my eyes. “I get tired so much more easily at my age,” I sighed. “Perhaps some black tea would be in order.”

The man in the gray suit took in a very long, very deep breath through his nose. I think he was trying to control his temper. “You don’t seem to realize that the only thing preventing me from hurting you is that it would be more convenient for you to cooperate.” He leaned forward. “But my mind is rapidly changing on the matter.” I could tell that his pulse was quickening.

So I stood up and wandered to the kitchen in the rear. I felt like the weight of the world, my world, and each of the too-long decades was filling my legs like cement. By the time I got to the doorway, I had to lean against the wall just to fight off the exhaustion enough to stay upright.

I don't know how long I stayed in that position. I was struggling to stay awake. At one point I forced myself to blink rapidly and turn my head back toward the man in the gray suit.

His companions had dozed off. Those armchairs really were quite comfy. But he was slouched over on the coffee table, his forehead resting on crossed arms as he tried to keep himself from falling asleep. 

“The future owner of this shop should really know a couple of things,” I mumbled. “The first is that the appliances are positively ancient. That old stove should have been replaced decades ago.” I yawned. “The second is that its pipes pass just over there, near the place you're sitting, where I've ripped a hole in the wall.”

He stared at me in sudden hatred.

But he couldn't stand up.

“You really should have taken my offer for some tea,” I droned through a forced smile. “Coming into the kitchen just might have gotten you far enough away from the carbon monoxide to give you a chance to escape.”

His head hit the coffee table with a bang.

“It must be agonizing to know that you could be free of this… odorless… gas if only you had the energy to walk out the front door.” I slid against the wall into a sitting position and rested my cheek on my shoulders. “It's funny... a man like you must have fought so hard to stay alive through so much violence... and it's all going away because you underestimated Grandma...”

There was nothing but silence on the other side of the room.

Even at full coffee bean meter, the coffee is very weak and tastes like water. 

My suspicion is the grinder is not getting enough beans. Listening to it, it sounds like maybe only 1-2 beans get caught and ground and visually I do not see any beans even move.  Our old auto coffee machine that ground beans and made coffee - you could easily see the beans move as it ground them, showing it was taking them.  Checking the puck grounds, it does seem to be close to the size of what i see in review videos - so perhaps this device just does not chew up many beans?

I attempted to visually inspect the bean grinder, at the top, where the beans are - but it looks like its not meant to remove or adjust. I thought maybe there was a blockage or packaging I did not remove.

Perhaps this machine is great at making espresso, but poor and not good design for coffee?  Our work has an entry level Jura (I know diff manufacture and much more expensive) but that coffee is bold, rubust and thick normal great tasting coffee.

Appreciate any advice.

There are actually 3 different stations in the restaurant, the bar, the Churros and the Savory food. You have to order separately from each spot and they give you numbers for servers to find you. The problem is there are a ton of people and the servers have a hard time finding people, allowing the food to get cold during the hunt. I’m assuming they will switch to beepers or standard table numbers soon. 

We only ate the churros and chocolate which were disappointing. The churros were hard, stale-ish and lacked flavor. The chocolate was underwhelming and lacked depth of fine chocolate. 

The limited food menu looked good and well priced. 

I bet the chocolate drinks were good! Most looked like rich hot chocolate in different forms, from cocktails to infused coffees. 

The space was nice and comfortable and was a nice mix of coffee shop, cafe and fine foods. But it will be interesting to see how the furniture ages in the Texas sun. They will also need a plan for the winter and summer as there are  no heaters or fans/misters. But they can figure it out.

1 - I cosigned to get his ex out of jail for violating a protective order so he could go to rehab when I was told rehab was arranged and he would be leaving the county jail to the airport and rehab

2 - I immediately got ghosted for the next week and kept getting calls from the bail bondsman about missed appointments, drama, where is this guy, and we're pulling the bail

3 - Got a facetime call a couple of days after my guy started texting me showing he had the literal crap beet out of him, bruises, cuts, and bleeding, so I left work, picked him up, and brought him to my place

4 - Got told a few hours after that my guy had to go to work or he was going to lose his door dash account,  he would work for a couple hours, and come back to my pace to be safe, and since his phone was smashed and practically unusable, bought him a used iphone XR on the way to pick up his car, almost called 911 when his ex was there and tried to start a fight. 

5 - I went back over to my guy's house when the bail bondsman called me and told me his ""ex"" was there, ended up calling the police, and they picked his ""ex"" up. 

6 - Paid another $975 for my guy to get in a hotel room so he could get some ""independence"" and ""work on himself

7 - Went on a door dash run with this guy in a car at 11PM with an expired tag and no insurance and ran out of gas in a shitty part of the city when he refused to let me put a couple bucks in the tank saying it would be good

8 - Saw a meth torch on his coffee table when he invited me over to his room one evening shortly after that

9 - Gave him my gas card and paid for his license plate so he would be safe

10 - Asked for my gas card back when he told me one of his druggy friends saw it (it has my name and picture on it) and got blamed for causing drama by cutting the card off and leaving him in a dangerous situation, re: gas

11 - Agreed to help him move the last bit of things and clean his old house and when I show up, there;s a skeevy-ass obvious dealer there, my guy is incoherent, has what looks like injection marks on his arms, and needles on his counter, so I bailed. Got blamed for stressing him out and his decision to do ""GHB"". 

12 - Blocked him, then a couple of days later unblocked him and tried to work it out

13 - God invited over to his house where he had an ""employee"" who was helping him do some work for an event my guy had the next day and saw the employee take a bag of meth off the table and hide it from me

14 - Got called the next morning to help with this event after I had worked all night because his employee got drunk and bailed

15 - Drove his car to the event because he said he wasn't in any shape to drive and spent the whole day there working for him for free and found out he was telling me we were going to spend the night together and making all sorts of plans, and telling the other person who showed up to work (also for free) that I had trapped him by insisting on only taking one car and I was demanding and controlling

16 - Dropped him off at his place and while i am walking home, started getting psycho texts about how I am the problem and don;t listen to him and I am always going to be alone and deserve it and a bunch of other shit like that

I blocked him again and I am still actually wavering on that. He's an obvious drug user and manipulator. I'm a type A personality, own my house, have two fantastic jobs and I am about to go back to school for my master's degree. 

Why does this shit hurt so much, why am I questioning whether I am in the wrong here, and why am I wavering even in the face of such an obvious wall of red flags from hell?

1guy5i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1guy5i0/am_i_crazy_or_is_my_boss_stealing_my_tips/,"Am I crazy, or is my boss stealing my tips?","I work in a relatively large hotel as a housekeeper.  Back in June, I was making anywhere between $30 to $200 from guest tips. Since about mid August, I'm lucky to recieve any tips at all. 

Now before you tell me its the dead season, heres a few key points. 

1. We're connected directly to an international airport via skybridge.

2. Our occupancy percentage isnt reflecting any indication of a ""lack of guests""

3. My boss is in and out of EVERYONES rooms that are ready to be cleaned nearly 2 1/2 hours before we're even punched in to our shift. 

4. My average tips received for the last 3 months has been .30 cents, while my average board has maintained upwards of 12 - 20 rooms per day. (I work 5 days a week)

5. I've received tips from guests for doing as little as bringing a towel or a few coffee creamers to their room.

Therefore, it appears to me that my boss has been swiping my tips to any rooms she can get into before i can. 

I make $15 an hour, and used to rely on my tips to float me through the week. I'm currently looking for a new job, but in the meantime what should i do?

We go to the same church, she says hi and smiles to me every time. We already have some rapport, mutual friends.

 I’ve had a couple dates in the past with others but nothing has ever worked out and I’m over 30 now. Needless to say the only thing I’ve leaned is to have regular conversations but I’ve never really learned how to pursue interests without it blowing up in my face!

I just want to take her to coffee and get to know her more, and ask in the least awkward way as possible. 

Please don’t give me any self improvement nonsense advice. I am fit, I travel, have hobbies and friends. Pursing a new degree as well. But I’ve never had a girlfriend before and no one’s ever really taught me how, everyone else just seems to know what to do naturally. ",1,1732025832.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1guy54r,https://www.reddit.com/r/JanitorAI_Official/comments/1guy54r/just_a_tip_for_bot_makers_regarding_speaking_for/,Just a tip for bot makers regarding speaking for user,"I've seen some bots with a whole bunch of instructions about not speaking for the user and all, but their first message is written from user's POV, speaking and acting for the user. That's kind of a bad example for the AI right off the bat.

Your first message should be from the {{char}}'s perspective (even if written in third person), and you should minimize descriptions of what the user is doing or saying. I know it's kind of tricky and limiting, but it will set a much better example for the bot to follow.

It's really hard to omit all actions of the user on the first message, depending on the situation, but there is a good and bad way to do this.

Just an example.

Don't do:
{{user}} walks into the cafe and spots {{char}} drinking coffee. {{user}} walks up to her and sits down, with a smile on his face.

Instead, do it like:
{{char}} is sitting down at a cozy cafe, drinking her morning coffee. She sees a stranger walk up to her with a beaming smile. etc etc.

Edit: Of course, this is mostly talking about character bots. Scenario/RPG bots might intentionally be written from User's perspective and that's fine.",19,1732025828.0,JanitorAI_Official,15,1.0,False
