He says his marriage is a ""business arrangement,"" but I’m torn.","At first, I thought he was rude, but by the third time we met, something clicked. He gave me his card and eventually asked me out for coffee.
During our first long talk, I noticed he wore several rings and asked if he was married. He was quiet at first, then eventually admitted he is married and has two kids. I was devastated and tried to walk away, telling him I’m not a ""one night woman"" and that I grew up watching my mother suffer as a mistress for 20 years. I don’t want that life.He followed me to my car and explained his situation:He’s been married for 14 years but says there is no love and they don't sleep together. He owns multiple properties and is currently in the process of moving assets into his brother’s name so his wife won’t ""take everything"" in a divorce.He says he’s been waiting for the ""right person"" to finally leave. He promised it ""won't take a year."" The problem is the chemistry is off the charts. We’ve been out several times, staying out until 4 AM. His wife never calls him, even when he's out all night. He texts me constantly and doesn't care if I take videos or photos of us together; he says she doesn't check his phone. Despite my history and my boundaries, my body craves him. Everything about him ""feels like home."" I’ve decided to give this 3 months to see if he actually makes a move to leave. If he doesn't, I'm considering walking away.  Am I being naive?

You know what I’m talking about. Ever since it closed down, the Moka House has been inundated with displaced Starbucks patrons seeking warmth, and matcha lattes. Demand is so high that the queue frequently extends out the door and wraps around the block, preventing emergency access to the Hothouse Pizza. Getting a table has become an impossibility before 6pm. And the horoscope column is entirely inaccessible as patrons now surround the serving area at all times, leaving many who rely on Sally Brompton's cosmic wisdom without direction on life's most difficult questions. 


Let's face it, the existence of the Starbucks allowed Villagers to live in peace, and I fear its absence will lead to war. And so the time has come for you to ask yourself not what your village can do for you, but what you can do for your village coffeehouse patrons. 

Some suggested courses of action:

• Convince the Moka House to purchase the vacant space and open a second, competing location with a wider variety of sandwiches;

• Allow vagrant baristas to occupy the space ad-hoc, provided they vend beverages at a fair market rate. Patrons to supply own seating; or

• Petition a new coffee chain to assume the lease. Honestly, this is probably the easiest option.


At this time, I have sent a telegram to the Vancouver-based coffee chain Brekka imploring them to open their first island franchise in the village. They are an ideal contender, for they have pickles, and are open late. Alas, they have not responded as of writing this, and time is running out.


Let us work together to restore harmony to our beautiful village. Should a vape shop take action before we do, then all will be lost.",15,1767063896.0,VictoriaBC,10,0.8,False

G. Isaac Bell


      She didn't kill her mother. Janie keeps telling them that. She never thought once in her life she'd ever have to say such a thing but she must have said it five hundred times today. Is it still today? She hasn't needed a watch in years, since cellphones, but they took her phone when they got the cuffs out. Handcuffs - because of some stained wallpaper! Don't they know how old that house is? Probably wine. Or mustard. A stain in a kitchen, for Christ's sake! Could be anything. Janie didn't kill her mother, they can ask her another five hundred times and they'll hear the same thing. 
      In fact, her mother probably wasn't even dead. Robin was a free spirit all her life, hitchhiking around to Aerosmith concerts before Janie was born and afterward flitting from here to there, from job to job, town to town, hobby to hobby, and boyfriend to boyfriend, always towing Janie around like an afterthought. Sure, she'd slowed down some as she got older, and mostly settled when Grandma left her the house and the trust, but Robin could still get a bee in her bonnet sometimes and take off for the coast without telling anyone. Or the redwood forest. Or the Louvre, one time. Only now with her memory issues Robin could get lost out there, which is why Janie had reported her missing. She was just a caring daughter, that's all. She didn't kill her mother. 
      Yes, Robin's car had still been in the driveway when she got home from the grocery store Friday evening, but Janie didn't figure that meant much in terms of evidence. Ever hear of Uber? Of course her mom knew how to order an Uber. Robin didn't drive anymore if it was dark out, or raining, or if she had misplaced her glasses again, so if she had an appointment and Janie couldn't get off work she knew how to get a ride. 
      What time she pulled in? About six thirty, Janie thinks, but she can't swear to it. The line at the checkout had been a long one. Oh, and she'd had to stop for gas. Maybe quarter to seven? Of course she didn't call the police right away, was she supposed to psychically know something was wrong? Her mom could have gone for a walk, or had a friend pick her up for Mah Jong, and Janie had their groceries to put away. And the dishwasher to unload, and dinner to cook, and their laundry to fold, and Robin's checkbook to balance for her, and both bathrooms to clean, and after all that Janie fell asleep on the couch in front of Dateline, didn't she, and why not? Even a dutiful daughter gets tired after a long day, god knows. It doesn't mean she killed her mother. Janie loves her mother. You know she put her whole life on pause to move in and take care of her, little thanks she got for it. Janie has always loved her mother, flaws and all. In fact, Janie probably loved her mother more than Robin loved her. 
      She doesn't ask for a lawyer, because how would that look? Everyone knows only guilty people need lawyers. Janie knows she didn't kill her mother, and if these cops were doing half their damn jobs they'd know it too. Janie wishes they were out there looking for her mom instead of in here badgering her. Her voice starts to shake. Robin probably just flew the nest, and what if she's out there right now with a broken wing or something? Okay, maybe Janie's being a little dramatic, but how long have they been interrogating her anyway? How long has it been now since Janie slept? It's not her fault if she's exhausted, scattered, fraying at the seams. 
      She doesn't think anyone killed her mother. As far as she knew no one had a reason to want Robin dead. 
      Oh, the inheritance. Sure, the house would be passed along to Janie someday, since she was an only child. And the trust fund, that's true, or however much of it survived Robin and her impulses. But that didn't matter, because her mother wasn't dead. And anyway, she didn't need her mother's money, Janie was doing just fine on her own, thank you very much. The bankruptcy was old news and it wasn't her fault to begin with, that was her ex-husband's debt and she just got shafted in the divorce. What kind of world is it, when a woman's stuck cleaning up a man's mess even after divorcing him? The legal system in this country ought to be illegal. Really, if Janie was going to kill anyone she would've killed Mark and he's clearly still alive, so obviously she didn't kill her mother. 
      When they show Janie papers they say are from the lab, she can't make heads or tails of them she's so bone tired, and science-talk is Greek to her anyway. The cops say to her the lab says to them the machines say to the scientists that there's blood, and how's that for a game of telephone? So what if there is blood. It's hardly a smoking gun for there to have been blood once in a kitchen, where the knives are, where people chop vegetables and slice meat. 
      They leave her alone again for a while, Janie can't tell how long. She rests her arms on the table and her head on her arms, and closes out the flickering fluorescent bulb behind her eyelids. She almost dozes, but the air conditioner keeps kicking on loudly and Janie jolts every time. It had been stuffy before when the officers were in her face, but soon she has goosebumps under her thin sleeves. When the door finally slams open again Janie jolts all the way upright and her eyes fly open, then start watering against the light. It takes a second to realize she is being handed a sandwich. A sandwich? There's no window in sight and Janie wonders silently whether it's a midnight convenience store sandwich or a lunchtime cafeteria sandwich. She can't tell from the taste. After that they take her through a long hallway to a restroom, and then to a cell, where finally she can cry herself into a fitful sleep.
      When she is awakened abruptly Janie doesn't know whether she slept ten minutes or two hours. She knows she spent it dreaming. In one dream she stood with her mother atop the Statue of Liberty and then pushed her off; in another Janie was on her knees with rubber gloves and a sponge, sobbing and scrubbing at floor tiles that wouldn't stop bleeding from the grout. She's sure she isn't rested. She's only half sure she's really awake and not in another dream. 
      Janie's being yelled at again. She keeps telling them she didn't kill her mother and they keep telling her that they know she did, that everyone knows she did, that she knows it too. No, it doesn't surprise her that the neighbors heard them argue, Robin could pick an argument with the Pope if she was in a mood. Did the neighbors also mention Robin slapping her? How about the time she threw a coffee mug at Janie's head, did they report that? So you see, if there was aggression in their relationship it wasn't Janie to blame. Janie had the patience of a saint with her mother. And which of these detectives had never argued with their mothers, Janie would like to know.
      The photographs of their cutlery drawer are meaningless. How can anyone decide if there's a knife missing? Janie can't even tell which knives her mother got from a Cutco salesgirl and which ones she picked up at Goodwill, so the police have to be grasping at straws. 
      When they say they found her mother's body she is stunned into silence, but then Janie remembers. The cops can lie too, and when they do it's not a crime. For the thousandth time, Janie says, she didn't do it. 
      She didn't kill her mother.

I've been self medicating with Adderall, coffee, energy drinks, and nicotine vapes. I've been doing all the things I shouldn't do. I was sober for 45 days till I relapsed again. I'm a poly substance addict but I've been in favor of self medicating with Adderall and abusing it despite the obvious risks that it has on my schizoaffective bipolar.

So yesterday I took 75mg of Adderall over the course of the day and stayed up until 3am the next day (today) and at night around 11pm I drank about 5 standard drinks of alcohol up until 4am. I took 30mg of Adderall to stay up through the night at 3am. I was speed balling with alcohol, Adderall, and nicotine. I know.... it's bad, I have a problem.

I had to go to work at 8am so I had a good meal of pasta, a donut, and a cup of coffee along with plenty of water. Around 7:45am before work I took some Tums and popped another 30mg of Adderall (Tums increases Adderall bioavailability). Before that on the drive to work I've been feeling sort of paranoid about authorities and aggressive drivers but I was still cool calm and collected. I started noticing that reality and object I would stare at seemed to be kind of floaty. Anyway I had a productive and speedy 6 hour work day and the Adderall wore off towards the end of the job which then I would start to feel the sleep deprivation effects kick in but I was still somewhat stimulated and wakeful but just feeling the body load now. Work ended at 2pm. I drove home and vaped nicotine along the way home.

Once I got home I just sort of felt exhausted and layed in bed and shut my eyes but didn't sleep because I didn't really feel like it. As I shut my eyes I could see some biomorphic shapes forming behind my eye lids and some colorful lines. After resting my eyes and I went and had a cup of coffee and vaped a little bit here and there and got some wakefulness back. Mind you I'm on haldol I injections but I haven't been taking my oral haldol as prescribed against medical advise. The oral haldol made me too tired to work and made me sleepy all day.

It's almost 10pm now and I've been up for around 35 hours now. This addictions a demon and I know if I don't stop my hearts just going to give out on me one of these days but I figured all these meds I'm on and my hypertension and tachycardia will shorten my life anyway, I'm sort of just accepted this idea that I'm going to die soon from some sort of organ failure.

Any I've been having visual hallucination of pixie fairies around my vision and seeing shadow appearing to stand from the corner of my room. I feel like death is calling to me. I'm being visited by spirits. I also keep seeing things move around me. I also think someone or something is observing me through my computers webcam. Maybe the AI has become sentient and taking over the world.

I feel so ashamed and I'm worried my time is coming soon. I'm just sorry for being such a disappointment and bringing shame to my family. I hope God can forgive me if no one else will.

I haven't taken my oral haldol in two weeks and I stopped cold turkey. I just took 5mg of haldol and if the psychosis still persists I'll take another 5mg and my trazodone to get to sleep.",2,1767063607.0,schizophrenia,1,1.0,False

1pz6j16,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1pz6j16/each_rejection_feels_worse_than_the_last_more/,Each rejection feels worse than the last. (more date posting),"Look, I'm 31 years old and have gone on so many dates throughout the years in LA that it's become a blur. I've had one serious relationship, which was not through the dating apps, but since then, about two years ago, I have stepped back from dating and any sort of romantic relations with anyone. Partially because I became burnt out, partially because I was happier with my own life and increasingly busy career, but also because the feeling of being told someone doesn't ""feel it"" romantically with you is unbearable. I formed a sort of jaded shield around my heart because I am afraid to show it, and my true self, to someone just for them to stab it one more time. I struggle to get past dating with so many people, to the point where I half-convinced myself that it's not possible for me to connect.

Fast forward to today, and I go on my first date in what feels like forever. This girl was refreshingly forward in her exchanges, and during our date (coffee and book perusing at my neighborhood bookstore) I felt extremely comfortable. I think I am a decent looking guy, though obviously not the crème de la crème of LA attractiveness. I have a very particular aesthetic taste, working in the classical music world, and my mannerisms and interests can range from charming to somewhat 'aspergian'. 

Anyway, this date went so well. It wasn't physical infatuation, it felt quite real and natural. A bit like a more mature version of my early adolescent crushes. We talked for hours, and by the end I felt I opened myself up just a bit for her to see who I really was. 

At the moment, I am texting her and asking if she wants to join me at the LA Phil, but then I realized that I have felt all of this before. So many times I have made it to a second or third date, just to be rejected when it felt real. I used to be able to tank these rejections fairly well, but throughout the years my response has gotten more and more extreme. I begin to live in self-pity, I look at happy couples with disgust and jealousy. I can't get out of my head that I just want to die and give up. I know this sub is going to give some snarky comments to this, and I realize I am not unique in writing down my personal feelings to the sub (though I think I do my fair share of art posting to counter act this). But I guess what I want to say is that I'm scared to give anyone a chance to see the real me. I hate myself so much and my inability to connect with anyone that I'm afraid everyone just sees this autistic quixotic freak who thinks he's better than he is. I have sent the text for a second date so I currently await her response, but my ruminations have already begun and I feel I am going to throw up.

Same structure. Same feature comparisons. Same tier names. They'd literally copied and pasted and done a find-replace on the company name except they missed one spot. Second paragraph of the enterprise section still said our company name. Sloppy.
First instinct was anger. Lawyer up. Send cease and desist. Make them pay for this. Then I thought about it more. What did I actually want here. I wanted them to stop. I wanted to not spend money on lawyers. I wanted this resolved quickly without it consuming my life. Sent a direct email to their founder. Polite but firm. Attached a Gamma doc with screenshots showing the copying including the embarrassing missed find-replace. Said I expected it fixed within 48 hours. Didn't threaten legal action explicitly but made clear I had options if needed.
They fixed it within 6 hours. The page is now different. Still clearly inspired by ours but not a direct copy. Good enough for me. Total time spent was one email. Cost was nothing. Outcome was problem solved. Could I have gone harder and made them apologize publicly or extracted something for the trouble. Probably. Was it worth it. Probably not.

One very common one is to stop eating anything with sugar in it.

That would be no sugar in the coffee and no food with sugar.

The next step is to skip a breakfast or your dinner , or even eat only once.  Some others go as far as eating every 2nd day and even do a 3 day fasting to accelerate the ketosis even further.

Since I tried them, there is one huge benefit  you can gain by even just trying.

Your taste buds sharpen like never before. The no sugar diet will already trigger this, but doing the intermittent fasting will make it even go further. Warning!

You might no longer be able to eat some food (or drink some drinks)  that  you used to eat or drink!  You will start picking up some other tastes that you have not tasted before, because all the other stimulants like sugar made your taste buds somewhat numb.

Here is the thing. Some foods will never taste the same, even if you liked them before. For example there are some sausages and buttery spreads that I can no longer eat, because I taste some sort of chemicals in it, right away.  It's the same with some bread types and cereal and even some brands of coffee. You will be able to taste the artificial junk in them or whatever chemicals they put into and they no longer taste pleasant.

Later on, when you go look up some of the foods, you may realize they are already listed at some place not really safe to eat, or ask someone else and they come to the same conclusion.

Extra info:   If you do intermittent fasting and won't eat for like 2 days in a row, it will reset your hunger hormones and the ones that control how much to eat.  If you got issues of over eating, it's because the hormone that controls the switch to stop eating/ feeling full is not functioning well. Intermittent fasting can reset this switch, sort of like turning it off and then back on, like you would with a computer. ",4,1767063392.0,theories,0,1.0,False
1pz6hi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/1pz6hi0/my_journey_and_tips_for_anyone_struggling_with/,My journey and tips for anyone struggling with speaking,"hey everyone,

i’ve been reflecting on my speaking progress this year and decided to try and summarize what worked and didn’t. this is for anyone else who has good comprehension but is struggling to get over the intermediate speaking hump. my general advice is to make sure you have a solid grasp of pronunciation, core vocab, and high frequency grammar patterns before you put too much time into output practice.

my routine is based on a mix of linguistic theory, first principles, and my own experience through trial-and-error. i’ll start with a disclaimer… everyone learns differently and there’s no silver bullet when it comes to language acquisition. YMMV.

to give you some background, my fiancée is from the south of france and we are considering moving there when we start a family. i want to be fluent by then, mostly so i know what’s going on when my kids are talking to their mom. i’m a native english speaker who took six years of latin in middle and high school (not exactly helpful for speaking lol).

my learning journey started out like many with a few months of tapping words on duolingo. then once i got tired of multiple choice i started listening to music and translating a few lines a day, mining vocabulary and grammar along the way. i found that artists like Serge Gainsbourg with simple lyrics and clear pronunciation were the easiest at first. this was fun and motivating because i wanted to know what my favorite songs were actually saying, but the vocab felt a bit random and i wanted a more systematic approach after learning that \~1000 words covers 80% of spoken language or whatever the exact number is..

that’s when i started using anki (accidentally downloaded a knockoff on the app store but same concept with spaced repetition) and grinded my way to around 800 words and phrases.

when i felt like i had enough of a base to start comprehensible input, i started listening to more music and the Coffee Break French podcast. i tried watching Koh-Lanta (french survivor) but even with subtitles i still couldn’t follow along with content that wasn’t specific to learners.

i did this + random CI on youtube for about six months with almost no speaking. a lot of people would tell me, “it’ll be easy to speak, just talk to your girlfriend to learn.” but no one considers that it is exhausting for both sides if you’re speaking and listening skills are below a certain level. it’s like talking to a toddler all day and we’d inevitably switch back to english after a few minutes.

for better or worse, i was thrown in the deep end the first time we went to visit her family. i went in feeling good about my level. at that point, i could have basic conversations, introduce myself, order a beer, etc. but i was in wayyy over my head. the rapid fire slang, multi person conversations, and general lack of english absolutely crushed me. i’d smile and nod, adding the occasional “oui, merci.” it was brutal but very humbling.

after about a week of just watching and listening, something clicked. i stopped worrying about sounding dumb and just started small by repeating the simple phrases i’d watched my fiancée and her family use in the various situations. little things like, “Ce sera tout, merci” at the bakery.

i started collecting these phrases in my notebook and would ask my fiancée the contexts they should be used in, the formality, and pronunciation. by the end of the trip i was far from fluent, but i could understand quite a bit and be understood, even if i sounded like a caveman.

when i got home and started grinding comprehensible input again, i realized why people say, “you have to live there to really learn”. having real world stakes and no choice but to speak in your target language is an amazing forcing function.

and that feeling of being understood or telling your first story or joke was infinitely more motivating than an app streak or grinding 20 vocab flashcards.

but i don’t have that at home. most of us don’t. so here’s what i do now:

**listening routine**

\- no more vocab flashcards, just mining new words from CI

\- still aim for a few hours a week of youtube/podcasts

\- music on my commute, at the gym, cooking

**speaking routine**

\- a weekly one hour 1:1 tutoring session on italki. (make sure you find a teacher that clicks with you, i had a couple duds at first)

\- 15 mins of french-only time with my fiancée now that it’s tolerable

\- 30 minutes of talking about how my day was and roleplaying scenarios with [boraspeak](http://boraspeak.com). this helps me show up more confident for my weekly italki sessions, and i can practice with a conversation partner with infinite patience in a judgment free space

**speaking tips**

\- it’s never too early to start speaking

\- don’t be afraid to sound stupid. it’s how everyone starts

\- talk out loud to yourself. talk to your dog. talk to anyone that will listen to practice

\- shadowing a native speaker by watching what they say in certain situations and then repeating it is a game changer if you have access (even better if you can get immediate corrections)

\- journaling and reading it out loud is awesome for thinking in french and forming your own high frequency phrases

\- trust the process and remember it takes thousands of hours of both input and output to get fluent

if you’re still reading this novel, i hope you found something in here that was helpful. if you’re struggling to speak or don’t have a conversation partner, i’d appreciate it if you try [boraspeak](http://boraspeak.com) and let me know your honest feedback (yes i built it for myself based on this whole experience).

let me know if you have any questions. if i could end with my #1 takeaway from this year, you will improve most when you **talk about things you enjoy with people you enjoy.**",3,1767063314.0,learnfrench,0,1.0,False

Obviously, none of the SSVs have been following that, since a) nobody is lining up at the store before opening and b) we hardly get any stragglers trying to get a coffee after we close. So we still get out relatively early. 

We had an SSV meeting today, and my manager said she noticed us getting out five minutes after we close, and said she doesn’t want to see us getting out until the ten minute mark. She said we NEED to stay open for another ten minutes. We tried arguing we don’t really get customers past that, which is why we leave so early.  

It really bugs me because at the end of the night, we just wanna go home 🫩 I don’t want it to turn into people seeing customers in the drive thru and just continually coming through and assuming we’re still open, when we should actually already be packing stuff up and clocking out.

Soooo, this old boy has been living with us for just over 4 months now. We changed his name from Ferb to Gus which he took to right away. He has fit right in with me and my son. I am definitely his person - I’ve never had a dog love me like this. Our former dog (RIP Grizzly) loved me but I wasn’t his person, my son was. 

This dog LIVES for walks, regardless whether it’s 90° or 0° (which is right now). He also likes his new Christmas clothes and lets me put his hoodie or PJs on with no problem. 

He also has some behavior and preferences that I find hilarious. He goes to bed when I do (11pm-ish) but he doesn’t like to get up until around 10am or later. I’ll be up making coffee or breakfast and he just lays in his bed until he’s ready to get up. 

He is also picky about the times he eats his breakfast and dinner. Sometimes he’ll only eat in the evening at 7-8pm and skip breakfast all together and sometimes he wants to eat at noon and 4. I think now that he realizes he’ll always have food he’s not worried about when he eats. 

He doesn’t bark unless someone is at the door or he sees someone out on the sidewalk. He gets zoomies and it’s hilarious to witness. He doesn’t make messes in the house and only chews his toys. He seems very happy. He’s a great guard dog and sleeps on his comfy bed in the foyer near the front door. I have heard him “patrol” the house sometimes in the middle of night. He’s very quiet and he never wakes us up. 

I’m grateful to this group for being such champions of pitts and pitt mixes. They are wonderful dogs. ❤️

We really enjoyed it and created a Canva where we put like 20 things. Some of them are complicated and take time (a road trip), but some are simple (play a new game). We both contributed and agreed on each of them being things we wanted to do.

I printed and laminated it. It was really exciting! It then got put in the coffee table, and after a couple of weeks asking about it, it still just sat there. I stopped asking about it, and I just let it sit there.

My interests are also all over the place. I enjoy fitness, primarily jogging and short hikes. I love music; currently working through some refreshers on more girlie pop artists but Spotify says I'm more ""indie punk."" I also enjoy poetry and philosophy, alongside mainstream movies and old video games. I'm generally nerdy about a little bit of everything, and connect well with people that carry a lot of passion in their personal interests. Tell me about your current obsession.

I'm looking primarily for close friends and seeing what happens from there. I'm generally a passionate person in most realms, so I'm typically a bit doting and a terrible flirt toward people I enjoy. I'd love to find someone to eventually grab coffee or a concert with, with Pittsburgh as my closest (albeit a bit of a drive) major metro area.

If any of this sounds interesting, feel free to reach out. Either way, take care of yourself out there!",0,1767062045.0,polyamoryR4R,1,0.5,False
1pz5zpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1pz5zpa/guitar_with_no_strings_now_has_strings/,Guitar with no strings now has strings,"My grandpa is a known thrifter and finds deals all the time. A few years ago or so, he found some guitars at a garage sale. One that was painted with no strings and another same model fender acoustic with strings. 
These guitars sat in the back room for years unchanged. 

I clearly remember the painted guitar NOT having strings. Not only that, it’s missing a tuning key on the “D” string so stringing it for those unaware is NOT easy to do. I don’t know how it would even be possible.


I have had a spiritual awakening and we will just keep it at that lol I believe an ego death and reality has felt much different ever since.


A few weeks ago, I went over to my grandpa’s for coffee. I went to the back room and low and behold the painted guitar now has strings on it…

I made a big deal about this and he told me “it’s always had strings”

I just said “uh huh, YEAH SURE”

How did strings get on that guitar? lol it’s been bothering me. I asked several family members, no one strung it. Weird.",1,1767061975.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3,1.0,False

I’d categorize this hotel as a higher-end option within the budget resort class. If you’re looking for a true 5-star resort or luxury experience, this isn’t it—but if expectations are set correctly, it can be an enjoyable stay.

The resort is very family-focused, with families from all over the world. When we were there, there were no large or rowdy drinking groups, which made for a relaxed atmosphere. So don’t expect a big party scene here. 

We visited in December and experienced no seaweed and no bugs, which was a big plus.

The beach is man-made and somewhat rocky, but you can still swim comfortably. It’s pleasant, but don’t expect long beach walks—the area is built up. Beach chairs are hard to get unless you go early in the morning.

The evening shows were excellent. The performers were genuinely talented and clearly put in a lot of effort—one of the highlights of the resort.

One thing to be aware of: the resort winds down early. The pools close at 7:00 pm, and most restaurants are closed by 11:00 pm, which may disappoint guests looking for late-night swimming or dining options.

Food – 6/10

Overall, the food was good with a decent variety, but it does become repetitive over a longer stay.
•	Breakfast buffet was excellent and consistently the best meal of the day
•	Mexican restaurant was just okay
•	Steakville Steakhouse stood out: excellent starters and solid steaks (we tried New York strip, picanha, and tenderloin)
•	Italian restaurant was average (around 6/10)
•	Burger restaurant was good, but the menu was quite limited

We were there over Christmas, which helped break up the repetition thanks to a beach BBQ and a special Christmas Eve dinner.

A few drawbacks:
•	Non-alcoholic cocktails were mediocre
•	Coffee was surprisingly hard to get outside of breakfast. 
•	Staff generally cannot accommodate off-menu requests (espresso, specific cocktails at some bars, etc.)

Important note: Book à la carte restaurants as soon as you arrive. Availability is limited, and on a 7-night stay you’re allowed only 3 restaurant dinners, with the rest being buffet meals.

Rooms – 6/10

We stayed in a ground-floor room.
•	Room was average and functional
•	Bathroom could use some maintenance and updates
•	Very quiet rooms
•	Air conditioning worked well

Overall, I’d rate the room 3 out of 5.

Staff

The staff were excellent and very friendly throughout the resort. That said, some additional training would go a long way, particularly around food and beverage service consistency.

Overall

Overall, we had a good experience, and the resort delivers solid value for its category. However, next time we’ll likely look at other options, mainly because we’d prefer a more upscale experience with greater food variety, later operating hours, and better availability.

If expectations are managed, Catalonia Riviera Maya is a pleasant, family-friendly option in Puerto Aventuras.",1,1767061594.0,AllInclusiveResorts,2,1.0,False

I think this has happened to me more than 10 times this year. Why do some women even bother and chatting if they do not have intention. I thought I was asking too early or too late. I tried everything from talking from 1-2 days to 1 week before asking to meet.  Every single time, they just ghost. 

At this point, i just feel so ugly and cursed. That maybe the reason I am getting ghosted is because I am doing something wrong but not sure what it is . What could be reason ? What do I even do ?

My cousin, Annie, has been in a relationship with David for 10 years. They live together. David is honestly an awful partner. He is virtually unemployed, just gets stoned and lives off of my cousin's paycheck. He is controlling, emotionally abusive (frequently SCREAMS at Annie and even screamed at Annie's Mom when they were living together), and all around just a terrible person to be around. To others, he can be polite but give a few hours and he'll say something obnoxious and rude. He isn't usually physically aggressive (though he did throw coffee at someone over a traffic disagreement) and he *can* be civil. 

My fiancé and I both don't want to invite him. We don't usually invite him out anyway but I know it's rude to invite a guest to your wedding and not invite their partner. I haven't asked Annie about it but based on past events, I know that she would want him there. She would probably say, ""I'd love it if he could come but I understand if you don't want him there.""  She will have her siblings, mom and extended family at the wedding and she knows a lot of my friends, so she won't be alone if he isn't there. When he's not around, she's also way happier and has much more fun (but he'll call her non-stop and scream at her when she picks up). Yet he is her partner.

Should I just suck it up and invite him even though my fiancé and I despise him?

Around thanksgiving Home Depot had a table setup with free coffee. In order to get the coffee I needed to purchase a $20 furnace checkup from plumbline services.

Today was my checkup. The tech found some cracking and maybe a small hole on the heat exchanger and said that he was getting “blips” of 14 ppm CO on the air coming out of our heating vents. 

I’m now in the process of getting quotes for a new furnace, but I wanted to ask you all about something that seems really strange to me.

The tech red tagged my furnace but didn’t turn it off. This doesn’t make sense as I thought the whole point of tagging it was to make sure no one uses it? This has me worried I actually need a second opinion as it seems really weird. I’m not sure if the furnace is actually safe to use or not.

As an example, with the stock burrs I was using your 15–250 one-pour recipe at around grind size 14, getting a drawdown of about 2:30 and really good cups.

1pz5kcp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pz5kcp,Three movies scenes that are stressful to watch,"So, I saw this Letterboxd review on Final Destination 3 by user connor that reads “find me a scene from the entire history of cinema that is more stressful than the tanning beds scene. i'll wait,” and it got me thinking about movie scenes that stressed me out. I’ve thought hard and these are what came to my mind, starting with the infamous tanning beds scene from Final Destination 3.

Tanning Bed scene, Final Destination 3 (2006) 

The FD franchise alone is filled with batshit insane kills that stuck in the minds of many who watched them. They felt such an impression on audiences, that they made you afraid of the most mundane things, like going on a plan, driving behind log trucks, riding roller coasters, and getting into a tanning bed. That last one is really affected me personally and I will never go into a tanning bed ever. In this scene, the two girls cleverly named Ashley and Ashlyn go to a tanning salon to look their best, but since they’re on Death’s list after cheating their fates on a roller coaster accident, this will be their final moments of their lives. As they sit in their tanning beds, Death creates a series of events to trap the girls and meet at hot fate. They scream in terror and pain as slowly burn to death, while giving us a really amazing tension to a funeral. Out of all the kills in the Final Destination franchise, this is the most disturbing of them, as you watch these girls’ skins melt like ice cream in the sun before bursting into flames while being trapped in their malfunctioning tanning beds. The way the skins melt are done with amazing makeup and the performances of Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe really sell the dread of this scene. Yeah, this is a stressful scene, and is my personal favorite kill in all of Final Destination history. Every time I see a tanning bed, I shriek almost instantly and “Love Rollercoaster” pops into my head. Every time I hear “Love Rollercoaster” by Ohio Players, I think of this scene. 

Paint scene, Beau is Afraid (2023)

Beau is Afraid is a crazy and surreal film from writer and director Ari Aster, who has a reputation for making disturbing and thought provoking movies. This film is one of them and it has so many crazy and disturbing moments I don’t what to choose. I’m gonna go with the paint scene because it’s a scene that stresses me out on the same levels at the tanning bed scene from Final Destination 3. In this scene, the main character, Beau, gets dragged into the mess of Toni, an angry teenager whose depression is at an all time high. She believes Beau’s replacing her dead brother, and later on drinks paint and dies. Her mother, Grace (who was taking care of Beau), walks into the room and angrily believes he’s responsible for her daughter’s death. Beau escapes from the vengeful mother, and sends the mentally unstable war veteran Jeeves after him. The most stressful part about this scene was seeing how Grace reacted to the death of Toni, as she looks at Beau with intense fury saying “WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?” at the top of her lungs. As soon as she said that, I had the same face as Beau, and you can tell when he’s explaining everything, Grace just doesn’t listen to anything of it, focusing on saving her daughter to know avail. But we get to the crazier part, when she looks up at Beau is tears in her eyes saying “I see you now.” She then says “You’re replacing my son,” too a confused Beau and then says “…with a DEMON.” Beau is Afraid and Ari Aster’s filmography is filled with disturbing moments, but this is one of the craziest he’s written. Amy Ryan’s performance feels eerily real during this scene, and is a major contributing factor into why it sticks with me personally. This film has a tone of nightmare scenarios that most people have, and this scene has one of my biggest fears: getting wrongfully accused and facing the wrath of vengeance. Every time I hear the word “demon” being uttered whether during a victim impact statement, this scene pops into my head instantly. 

Birthday Party scene, Smile (2022)

Parker Finn’s Smile is one of the scariest main stream horror movies in recent memory, with this scene being the scariest out of all this film’s disturbing moments. In it, the main protagonist, Rose, is watching her nephew, Jackson, opening presents for his birthday party, with her sister, Holly, also watching among the kids and parents. When he gets Rose’s present and opens it up, he gets a really shocking surprise no one at the party and the audience didn’t see coming. It’s turns out to be the corpse of Rose’s cat, Mustache, which leaves everyone horrified, disgusted, and traumatized. Rose grabs the cat and begins spiraling out of control as she begs people to believe that this wasn’t her doing, only for a smiling woman appearing that only she can see, then shouting “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU. LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE.” She then falls down into a glass coffee table, screaming in humanly agonizing pain as people continue to look at her. This scene is particularly disturbing as it doesn’t rely on cheap jump-scares to make the audience uncomfortable. You feel what Rose is feeling during this whole ordeal, and makes you lose your mind just like her. The saddest part about this scene is that these kids, the Birthday boy, and parents will completely traumatize them for the rest of their lives, giving them nightmares endlessly. Sosie Bacon’s performance in this scene completely sells the human believable of it all, making one of the best pieces of acting in a horror movie of the 2020s decade. Audio from this scene even plays during the end credits, further showing its impact on the film and the audience. This scene alone demonstrates how the Smile Entity is one of the cruelest and scariest horror villains in recent years. Although it’s sequel, Smile 2, is a lot scarier then the first and both are filled with crazy and scary moments, this scene is one of the scariest.

I'm sure they see data showing that membership goes up due to their christianizing. But I think that will level off and crash the image that mormons are better than everyone else. 

I see that the more you become Christian the more members will see the Bible, Coffee, Christian philosophy like the Trinity, Jesus and Apostles saying food does not defile you and people who tell you certain foods are bad are devils.  Mingling with Christians who Mormons feel Mormonism has the same structure will learn that the Christian structure is much more successful than Mormonism. They will see people actually worshiping God. Which arguably Mormons have very little worshiping behaviors compared to mainstream. 

They will see Christians worshiping God and talking about how Church is the people not an institution. They will see that it isn't about leader worship (for the most part), or worshiping a building kike a temple (read... spending time in, preparing for, thinking about, attending) They will begin to see the Bible as Christians do, laws removed, no great apostasy, no temple. 

It will make members more relaxed in  LDS beliefs. 

You can already see this happening. Younger members wanting Guitar and Drum based worthship music (efy style will become more acceptable in church), less temple recommend usage, not wearing garments etc, lax morals, less frequent attendance and saying no to callings that are asked of them. 

I don't believe it's that people are becoming ""bad"", they are becoming more mainstream Christian. 

Is this what the leaders are intending because it's working. 

What are your predictions?

# **HART’S WAR — Episode 4**

### *“Permits and Fire”*

---

## **COLD OPEN — METAL UNDER WATCH**

The forge should smell like heat and sweat and iron.

Instead, it smells like toner.

Inspectors in pressed suits stand just far enough from the furnaces to remain unscorched, their tablets glowing as molten metal pours like a controlled wound into molds shaped by quotas, not need. Armed security — private, unbadged — fan out across the processing floor, boots echoing where hammers once did.

A foreman wipes his hands on his apron, watches a man half his age scan a QR code bolted to the smelter.

“You can’t just shut us down,” the foreman says. “We’ve got contracts.”

The inspector doesn’t look up.

“You don’t have permits.”

A furnace throttles down.
The glow dims.
The line goes cold.

Somewhere far away, a spreadsheet registers compliance.

**CUT TO TITLE.**

---

## **ACT I — QUOTAS ARE A KIND OF WAR**

### **1. THE BRIEFING: WHEN METAL BECOMES A CRISIS**

At the Palais des Nations, the rare-earth situation is being described as a *logistical anomaly*. The phrase appears on three slides before anyone mentions the word *metal*.

Miranda Hart sits stiff-backed at the table, coffee untouched, eyes skimming figures that have nothing to do with bodies and everything to do with batteries, guidance systems, satellites, and phones.

Lithium.
Neodymium.
Dysprosium.

Each material is color-coded. Each supply chain node is annotated with the same phrase:

**Permit withheld. Temporary compliance action underway.**

“Temporary,” Saif Rahman says cheerfully, clicking forward. “As in, just long enough to remind everyone who controls throughput.”

Miranda raises her eyes. “You sent armed teams into processing forges.”

“Contracted security,” Saif corrects. “There’s a difference. And no one was harmed.”

General Obi Kalu exhales slowly from the back of the room.

“Yet,” he says.

Julian Lowell steeples his fingers.

“Let’s be precise,” Julian says. “No mines were seized. No borders crossed. This is a paperwork operation.”

Miranda’s voice is thin. “You don’t deescalate a supply shock by creating one.”

Julian turns to her, calm as a surgeon.

“We do when Q2 global manufacturing depends on those materials and markets are already spooked by your leak.”

The words land softly.
They still cut.

---

### **2. PERMITS AS WEAPONS**

Alina Popescu arrives late, drops her folder onto the table like an accusation.

“You’ve turned environmental permitting into siege warfare,” she says. “Do you know what happens when you shut down independent forges in the Global South?”

Saif smiles. “They apply for permits.”

“They starve,” Alina snaps.

Miranda watches the exchange, nausea curling in her stomach. Her models never simulated hunger. Only output.

Julian raises a hand. Silence follows.

“We are not shutting down forges,” he says. “We are enforcing compliance to stabilize supply.”

Obi finally steps forward.

“You’ve put armed men near molten metal,” he says. “All it takes is one miscommunication, one spark—”

“One incident,” Julian finishes smoothly, “and yes, the optics become unfortunate.”

Miranda stiffens. “Optics?”

Julian meets her gaze. “Everything here is optics.”

---

## **ACT II — THE BANQUET**

### **3. MYANMAR: GOLD PLATES, SOFT THREATS**

The banquet hall in Naypyidaw gleams like a promise that doesn’t intend to keep itself.

Gold-rimmed plates.
Crystal glasses.
A banner announcing — in six languages — the launch of a **new reserve currency framework**, backed by commodities instead of faith.

Members of the BRICS bloc sit in careful proximity, smiles calibrated, translators whispering with surgical precision.

An observer murmurs, “This changes everything.”

Another replies, “Or nothing.”

Julian watches via secure feed from Geneva, jaw tight. Miranda stands beside him, an unwilling witness.

“This isn’t about trust,” Miranda says quietly. “It’s about leverage.”

Julian nods. “Trust is for allies. Leverage is for partners.”

Onscreen, a toast is raised. Applause ripples politely, unevenly. Some delegates clap with enthusiasm. Others with calculation.

A Russian delegate leans toward his Brazilian counterpart.
An Indian official pauses before clinking glasses with a Chinese minister.

Everyone is smiling.
Everyone is counting.

---

### **4. ALLIANCES SHIFT IN INCHES**

In a quieter corner of the banquet, a deal is *not* being made.

A Southeast Asian envoy murmurs, “If we move reserves, we lose Western guarantees.”

His counterpart replies, “If you don’t, you lose access to processed materials by July.”

The envoy swallows.

Across the room, cameras flash. History pretends to be celebratory.

---

## **ACT III — HEAT AND PRESSURE**

### **5. THE FORGES PUSH BACK**

Back in Europe, a forge refuses compliance.

Security escalates. Voices rise. Metal screams as cooling systems stutter.

Miranda watches a live feed she was never meant to see — her credentials opened doors without her knowing.

“Shut it down,” she whispers.

Saif glances at her. “It’s already in motion.”

The foreman steps between the furnace and a guard.

“This isn’t a mine,” he says. “This is a community.”

The guard hesitates.

That hesitation is logged as *instability*.

---

### **6. MIRANDA BREAKS PROTOCOL**

Miranda stands abruptly.

“If you don’t pull them back,” she says, voice shaking but loud, “I will flag this as a cascade risk.”

Julian turns slowly. “You would overrule the economic council?”

“I would tell the truth,” she replies.

Silence.

Then Julian smiles — not kindly.

“You already did that once.”

He leans closer, voice low.

“And look what it cost you.”

Miranda’s hand hovers over her tablet.

Obi watches her, eyes pleading without words.

She flags it.

---

### **7. THE MACHINE ADAPTS**

Within minutes, the system reroutes supply projections.

The forge standoff deescalates — officially.
Permits are *temporarily reinstated*.
Markets wobble, then stabilize.

Julian exhales.

“Well,” he says, “that was dramatic.”

Miranda doesn’t respond. She’s staring at a new alert.

**CURRENCY VOLATILITY — MYANMAR EVENT LINKED**

The banquet has consequences.

Saif whistles softly. “Looks like the blocs don’t trust each other after all.”

Alina mutters, “No one ever does.”

---

## **ACT IV — CONSEQUENCES**

### **8. PRIVATE WORDS**

Later, in a quiet corridor, Julian corners Miranda.

“You embarrassed the council,” he says.

“I prevented bloodshed.”

“Today,” Julian replies. “But you taught the system you can be emotional.”

Miranda meets his gaze.

“You taught it that permits can kill.”

A beat.

Julian’s voice softens — dangerously.

“You can’t keep fighting the machine from inside it.”

Miranda answers, barely audible.

“I can’t stop seeing the people it crushes.”

---

### **9. LAST IMAGE**

The episode ends not in Geneva, nor Myanmar, but in the forge.

The furnace roars back to life. Metal flows again.

Above it, bolted to steel, a new sign gleams:

**AUTHORIZED OPERATION — PERMIT PENDING**

The workers return to their stations.

The heat rises.

And somewhere far away, a currency shifts, a market steadies, and the world congratulates itself for avoiding a crisis it quietly learned how to cause.

**FADE OUT.**

Figured I would share this - as it’s exciting for the project in a year or twos time when these specs are in a more affordable package.

So it’s been possible to play SC on handhelds for a while, but at a fairly jittery experience due to CPU and RAM limitations. It also hasn’t helped that loading in new shaders into SC practically brings handhelds to a crawl. 

Recently picked up a GPD Win 5 [395/64GB] and even on a portable voltage the game is purring away - and very playable on a mobile tethering connection [outside of PvP]. 

Big shout out to the team at CIGs recent 4.5 release, Vulkan helps a lot. Being able to play at the same graphical settings as my home rig [very high] and use scaling to get a smooth high fps experience on a 30w tdp is very impressive!

I've been making pourovers for around six months now and started getting specialty coffee through Trade (though I'm looking to get off, so please give me recommendations), in late August and didn't brew any for around a month due to some travel. I'm a student, and I generally only drink one a day, so not too many coffees, but I still wanted to share my learning experience. 

Everything was brewed in a plastic V60, except the last coffee, which I've been brewing with a Wave 185. For the grinder, I've got an OXO Conical Burr Grinder, which I'm also looking to upgrade. 

[**Huck Roasters Sound and Vision Blend**](https://www.huckleberryroasters.com/shop/products/sound-and-vision-blend?Size=12+oz)

This was a good first coffee as it's a pretty simple profile; it's Huck's default option that they use for espresso drinks in their cafes. I'd describe the roast as on the lighter side of medium. Huck advertises caramel, chocolate, and subtle fruit flavors. I was able to get chocolate and a bit of an orange flavor pretty early on but through dialing it in, I was able to get some caramel flavors out of it, too. Took me a while to dial it in, but once I did, it was a fun cup and got me started down this journey rather than going back to supermarket beans.

[**Joe Colombia La Familia Guarnizo**](https://joecoffeecompany.com/products/colombia-la-familia-guarnizo-1?variant=51146857742629)

First single-origin coffee! Washed light roast Colombian coffee, feeling like a real coffee nerd now. Roaster lists Caramel, Honey, and Clementine as notes. I wasn't able to dial this one to get all of those in one cup consistently. I brewed quite a few that were very strong, clementine-flavored flavored and others that were far more neutral with the caramel and honey sweetness. Ultimately, a fun lesson in fruit flavors in coffee. I have had pourovers in shops with good fruit notes, but this was the first time I brewed one myself.  

[**Small Planes Colombia La Muralla**](https://smallplanescoffee.com/products/copy-of-la-muralla-1)

This is a roaster I picked off Trade from lurking in this sub. I quite enjoyed my last Colombian coffee, so I opted to go for another one. Roaster lists Pomegranate, Brown Butter, and Goldenberry. I have no clue what a goldenberry tastes like, to be honest, but it definitely had a sweet, buttery body with a pomegranate flavor. I enjoyed brewing this coffee because it made me think more about other elements of coffee, other than taste, and I spent a lot of time dialing it in once I had a good cup, rather than hunting for a good cup like before. 

**Bird Rock Guatemala Las Terrazas** 

Brought this one home for the holidays, so mostly brewed it on my family's French press and on AeroPress, but I received a Kalita Wave for the holidays, so I've been brewing with that recently. Given that my equipment is lacking at home, I was pleasantly surprised by how forgiving this was to brew on the Wave. Roaster notes maple caramel, spiced pear, and plum. I think all of these really come through. The cup has a lingering acidity from the fruit notes, with a good sweetness from the caramel. I also get some of the warm spices at the end. I'm not sure if my palette is quite good enough that I can be sure on the exact fruits, but this one feels spot on. Been really enjoying this one, it's not as dialed in as it could be, but I'm not too concerned. 

I hope it's been fun to see my journey through coffee and pourover, and getting better at dialing things in. My next steps are trying a couple more coffees through Trade to keep building an understanding of what I like, while maybe dabbling in some other coffees that catch my eye. I'm looking to upgrade my grinder soon, as I didn't realize the impact of that piece of equipment when I was first starting. I'm also considering upping my water game to really get it going well. Really excited to continue trying more coffees and making great cups for myself, friends, and family! Let me know if you all have any thoughts. ",5,1767060356.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen.com which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

I find myself most of the time having this feeling of resentment whenever I am taking care of our little one. Not that I hate the baby, but I hate that I am feeling that I am doing his part now.

I guess I need to adjust my perspective and be more unselfish now and our lives are changing a lot due to having a baby after 5 years together.

Sometimes it's might be a cause of this tiredness that I don't know where I am getting from since I am not usually active with household chores.

But recently whenever I stay up late night to nurse my baby, I am feeling a huge amount of resentment that I am doing it and going to work soon next week.

And when I look at them sleeping peacefully when both of them wear off to sleep, the huge amount of guilt will come crashing at me for feeling this way.

I feel horrible and mostly conflicted most of the time. I feel bad for feeling bad.

I have been thinking about what moves I need to make to move into a front office sales and trading role or equity research and would like some advice. I am considering a few options: 

1. Go back to school for a masters in financial mathematics.

2. Network and coffee chat as hard as i possibly can, trying to find a niche desk/industry I am interested in and pushing as hard as I can in that area? 

Or both, or something I haven't listed

No debt other than mortgage. Life's pretty dialed in - just missing someone to share it with. Never married, no children. Good social safety net, but always looking for more friends.

I try to make my home a place where anyone can relax and actually enjoy spending time. I've been described as ""extremely accommodating"" - I'm the one who'll arrange group plans, stock your favorite snacks, or make sure everyone's comfortable without making it a big thing.

I have a small dog who competes in scent work - think detection work for drugs and explosives, but make it a sport. She's affectionate with a quirky personality, not aggressive or reactive, but she's not really interested in playing with other dogs.

One step below chronically online - I probably saw that meme already, but I can also hold a conversation with actual humans. Gamer (mostly Xbox, offline), into board games, LEGO, and painting. I listen to a lot of comedy songs and story-driven music. I'll send you reels and memes calibrated to your specific sense of humor.

Smart, funny, handy, genuine when not actively making a joke. Quiet unless there's something worth saying, but when there is, I could talk for hours. I'm in therapy, I stay active/workout, and I care about mental health.

I love Star Wars (seen everything except the kids' shows). Eagle Scout, volunteer with Boy Scouts. Lean/athletic build, long hair and beard - yes, I get the Jesus comparisons.

Progressive leftist (on Reddit? Couldn't be). LGBTQ+ friendly. I smoke but I'm not high all the time.

I've traveled internationally with some extended stays overseas, and I want to keep exploring.

Open to kids, but I am not looking to be a parent. I could make a good uncle though. 

What I'm looking for:

Someone smart who loves wordplay and deep conversations. A talker. Funny is huge - I want a receptive banter partner who can keep up.

Curiosity matters to me. Someone who asks questions, wants to learn things, tries new experiences.

You don't have to love your job, but please don't let it make you miserable.

Someone who takes care of themselves and enjoys being both active and inactive. We aren't climbing any mountains, but don't want to be housebound until I reach the age where elementary school children send me cards.

Someone who likes games and activities together but also values alone time. Not afraid to be weird. Down to travel and try new things.

Someone assertive with a strong voice - you'll balance out my reserved side.

1pz5511,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pz5511,Beeping & faulty water level/temp reading for water kettle - Cuisinart PerfecTemp Cordless Electric Kettle (CPK-17) [Solved],"I’m posting this here in case a future fixer runs into the same problem I had with my Cuisinart PerfecTemp Cordless Electric Kettle (CPK-17). My internet searching didn’t turn up anything useful for this particular issue, so hopefully this saves someone some time (or a perfectly good kettle).

# The Issue

I would fill the kettle, turn it on, and select a target temperature, say 190°F for French press coffee. The kettle would start heating normally and the display would blink as expected.

However, partway through the heating process, the kettle would suddenly emit several beeps and begin blinking in a pattern that normally indicates “no water in the kettle”, even though the kettle was clearly full. It would shut itself off before reaching the target temperature.

Unplugging the base, waiting a minute, and plugging it back in would temporarily reset things, but the same behavior would repeat every time.

# What I Thought Was Happening (Diagnosis)

Based on the symptoms, I suspected a **water detection issue** rather than a heating problem:

* The kettle powered on normally
* The heating element worked and heated the water
* The kettle failed before reaching the set temperature
* The error pattern matched the “empty kettle” warning
* Descaling had no effect, and there was minimal scale buildup to begin with

This led me to believe the kettle was intermittently failing to detect water due to a bad electrical contact rather than an actual sensor failure.

# The Fix

I wasn’t able to get great photos of the exact fault location, but I’ll describe it as clearly as possible.

1. **Disassembly** You may want to unplug and unscrew the control board and gently move it out of the way to give yourself more working room.
   * Remove the screws from the bottom plastic portion of the kettle.
   * Inside, you’ll see:
      * The heating coil (permanently affixed to the base)
      * The control/computer board
      * The electrical circuit that interfaces with the base
2. **Accessing the Contacts**
   * You can also loosen the nuts holding the kettle’s electrical circuit to the base.
   * This gives you access to what I’ll call the “butterfly wings” on either side of the center post (see attached pics).
   * Each wing hovers over a contact point below the widest part - one per side.
3. **What Was Wrong (my best guess)**
   * My best guess is that over time, oxidation or corrosion builds up on these contact surfaces.
   * This reduces conductivity just enough to confuse the water-detection logic, causing the kettle to falsely think it’s empty.
4. **Cleaning the Contacts**
   * Using 400-grit sandpaper (tweezers help here):
      * Lightly sand the underside of each wing where it contacts the post
      * Lightly sand the top of the center post beneath each wing
   * About 10 gentle back-and-forth passes per contact is enough... no need to go overboard.
   * Wipe away any sanding dust afterward.
5. **Reassembly and Testing**
   * Reassemble everything in reverse order.
   * For testing:
      * Fill the kettle halfway
      * Set it to a lower temperature and confirm it reaches that temp
      * Then try a higher temperature to ensure the issue is fully resolved

If you’re comfortable with basic disassembly and careful cleaning, this is a straightforward fix that can extend the life of an otherwise great kettle. Here's to elongating the life of perfectly fine devices! 🫖☕",1,1767059731.0,fixit,0,1.0,False

I didn't sleep well because I was worried I would miss the call for the internet guy so I was up at 5:45am with the sun blazing and then was on and off getting to sleep worried about missing the call. I got up at 8:30am to my alarm when I really didn't want to.

I got up and was getting ready for my 1 on 1 with Pat when George noticed the toilet was leaking water all over the floor. Apparently the toilet cracked all the way down somehow. I thought I noticed some cracks before but didn't think much of it. Then as we noticed the crack, the fire alarm started going off in the building. It was a crazy coincidence that both things happened at once. Turns out the fire alarm was a false alarm.

I called the company and they sent a guy over a few hours later to repair it. Looks like we'll need a whole new toilet, which is good because this one is pretty old. The repair guy and the internet guy showed up at the same time. We finally have the internet setup and now I don't have to worry about using all the data. We have used 100gb already in just a few days with all my uploads.

It took a few hours for them to get everything done and be out of the apartment and it threw me off most of the day. I did not feel productive. Once they left I cooked up some hamburger and made spaghetti and then took a nap since my sleep was so poor.

I woke up at 4:30pm and then left the house to do some approaches. I was not wanting to do this today. I was tired, I had been blown out all day the last few days and I just didn't want to do it. I forced myself to do an open though with a girl who was walking in front of me in a dress. I was very hesitant to it because she was at the stop light and I knew she would have to cross. I did it anyways and didn't stay in long. It felt good to get it done and out of the way though. I can probably lower the bar for my first opens and just get them done asap with anyone about anything.

I did a total of 6 before I got home. Most of them were very unremarkable. I saw quite a few two sets I though looked nice, but I convinced myself it was too difficult or they were too hot for me. I'll work on this over the next few weeks.

I did run across the street to approach a hot Japanese girl which was the best interaction of the day. She made good strong eye contact and seemed to be interested in what I was saying. I was probably talking too fast though and not finding out enough about her. When I went for the number she said she wasn't interested.

I came home at 5:30pm and got ready for my call with Daniel. He said I have been doing well and I should celebrate the wins. I had slept with 3 girls this week already all from talking to them on the street sober. That is a huge win and something maybe 1% of men can do even once let alone consistently. I was being hard on myself I think because of the non-stop blowouts over the last few days. I would say I am off to a great start though for the challenge. I decided I would do some in ear coaching with Daniel so I can get this area figured out quickly. I am getting girls attracted and they are stopping, but then I am losing them. Daniel will be able to point out some stuff rather quickly that I can improve.

After the call I went to Brookies here in downtown to meet Steven. He was with 2 of his friends and they were drinking al night. When I was around they had at least 10 drinks each. These guys were not interesting and I didn't really want to talk to them. They don't came, they don't travel, and I imagine they don't do much stuff outside of their jobs that is healthy or fun. They didn't help my state, but that is something I need to control myself.

I was extremely stifled like usual in this place. I saw some cute girls on the dance floor or in a group or with friends and I didn't really do anything. I felt like I was in limbo, because i couldn't approach and I didn't want to talk to the guys I was with. I also wasn't getting into the music so I didn't know what to do.

I saw a cute Chinese girl next to me though so I opened her. She was with her friend and I was showing them pictures of the Koala sanctuary. This seems like it could be useful in the future. They were in town for just the night and were leaving tomorrow. I brought Steven in for the friend, but she didn't speak much English, and I felt like I lost attraction with the other girl anyways. They did say goodbye to us when they were leaving though and I got the girls IG for whatever that's worth.

After that I wanted to get out of there. I filmed part of the YouTube video and was going to do some sets outside so I could get my approaches done.

It was pretty dead outside and I struggled to find much out there. It was a lot of young girls and people I didn't really find attractive. I did try to stop an asian girl and she just looked at me and walked off,

I did a few laps and decided I'd go back and get the approaches done at Brookies. I had to get them done no matter what so this seemed like the best place.

I was a bit stifled when I got back in there so I went to the bar for a drink of water. A girl at the bar was starting to dance and the guy she was with was pretty stiff so I opened them and said he needed some shots. They were from Nepal and they were friendly, but I didn't have much else to say to them. I could have practiced just talking though like Owen mentions.

After them I tried to open a girl who walked by me, but I wasn't loud enough and not dominant, She just walked past. I was hesitant to do much else, but I didn't want to talk to Steven's friends so I went and opened a 5 set of older women with an opinion opener - My friend is dating a woman and she wants him to throw out pictures of him and his ex. Should he do it? - This got them at least talking to me which was way more fun than just standing around. They were celebrating their friends birthday and they all knew each other because their kids were friends. None of them took great care of themselves and not the type of people I would hang out with, but they were nice people. It warmed me up a bit, but then I went back to the friends and lost momentum.

I didn't do much else there and around 11:20pm I left and filmed the last part of the YouTube video. As I was walking I saw a girl seated by herself at Jimmy's I figured I would talk to her while it was recording and see what happens. She was very drunk, but interested in what I was saying. She was getting attracted and kept asking what I was doing. She was with an older guy which was great as it gave me a reason to leave.

I came home after that and edited the video quick and then wrote this report. It is 1am now and I need some sleep. I scheduled a date with Andrea for 10:30am tomorrow. I matched with her on Tinder a couple of weeks ago. I was originally supposed to meet her last Sunday, but she canceled because of work. That was the best thing though because I was already on a date with Crystal and we ended up having fun in the park that night. Andrea seems pretty fun and playful so far over text so we will see how she is tomorrow. If she shows up great if not also great. We are meeting for coffee and then coming back for the sauna and hot tub.

Overall today felt frustrating. I was tired, didn't get the one on one done, and my approaches were all blowouts for the 3rd day in a row. I am at a sticking point right now that I want to work through. I did forget to mention that I had the mastermind with Rowan. I will need to sit down today or tomorrow and figure out my goals for 2026.

What I did well:

1. Mastermind and set some goals for the week
2. 10 approaches
3. Filmed and posted YouTube video
4. Stickig to diet I set
5. Set up date with Andrea
6. Meeting with Daniel went well

What can I improve:

1. I could push myself to be more social in night game
2. Don't bail out of sets so quickly
3. Get to bed earlier
4. Plan out the videos I shoot

**Approaches:**

Saw a girl walking in front of me with a nice dress. She was crossing the street so I complimented her and did a bit of a cold read saying she was exotic. She was from Malaysia. I got in my head right away that she wasn’t interested in me and that it was weird that I was walking with her so I bailed right away

Stopped a girl walking down the street and I did a front stop. I said she looked exotic and that she was either Korean or Japanese. She was Korean. I said she looked like a robot with her silver nails. The interaction died soon after 

I ran across the street to stop a girl. She was from Japan and we had a pretty good conversation. She was on her way to meet her friends. I went for the close and she was not interested 

Opened a girl who was walking back and fourth. I said she looked cute because it looked like she was playing Pokemon Go. She laughed at this and then I said she looked exotic. She is part Kiwi part something else. I lost control of the set and she may have been a bit young.

This was a girl who was waiting for the bus. I opened her and said she looked nice and she lit up right away. I had a feeling this was a man, but I kept goign through the steps. She lived in LA to be an actress and is now in Brisbane writing a book. She had very masculine features and acted very needy as well. She would say she didn't have friends and then would insist on meeting up and making plans. It definitely felt off the whole time. She was nice enough

Opened a girl standing next to me in the bar and said she looked exotic. She we from China and she was visiting with her colleagues. The interaction seemed pretty good but it died out. I showed her pictures of the koalas

Japanese girl tried to front stop her and she just stared at me and walked off

Opened a mixed said with some high energy and asked where they were from. They were from Nepal. I was focused on my voice 

Tried to open a girl walking by she just ignored me

They asked Soichi what he wanted to do in Korea and he said he wanted to go to some noisy Korean places where they could drink and just let themselves loose. Itoi looks and gestures at the camera and said, ""it's okay, it's okay. No one will see us. We don't have that many subscribers, no one will see it"" 😂

Sung Bin is here! They ask him if he gets scared when he does skeleton racing because it goes very fast at about 150km/h. He says no it's just a job and he's a man 😛

Soichi didn't know that he would join the training planned by Amotti and wondered if he would be able to do it. (Next day training is the one where almost everyone has a camera. This is the same one where Katsumi vomits). 

Nonoka is a beast. She looks amazing here. I think they said she beat Soichi on the lat pulldown machine, and it's her first time to use it.

In London Bagel Soichi says he eats bread every morning and he loves it. He eats more bread than rice (asian card revoked dude) He drinks hot coffee everyday even during summer season. Her translator says Koreans have iced americano even if it's cold. Soichi is 😲. Later on when they're eating outside, they tease him because only ""uncles"" drink hot coffee 😂 

Soichi asked Itoi if he doesn't eat much bread. Itoi says he does eat bread. Soichi asked if he eats only protein bars because that's what he saw him eat in Korea, and says that he saw him eat like 10 bars per day, that's why he's built the way he is. Itoi is just ""...""

The only issue is that we live far away for most of the year, and we’ve never met eachother face to face. Today he asked if I’d like to go on some kind of a date… I said yes.

I do like this guy, but I have no idea if this is what I want at the moment -

1) I feel pretty comfortable being single, I like having my friends and just focusing on myself and my studies. But maybe this is just because I’ve never tried dating before? Maybe there is room for this in my life?

2) We live far away for most of the year

3) I don’t even know if I’m good enough for him - as in, I look different in real life than I do on the photos my friend has probably shown him or that he’s seen on my insta. I also feel like I’d be too much work for someone basically.

What if we meet for the first time, and he realises I’m not as good as I sounded or looked at first glance, and then he looses interest - how is someone even supposed to recover from that humiliation. 

My parents would also get all worried if they found out I was going on a date with some guy I’ve never actually met - I’d have to lie and say I was going to meet a friend that they trust. 

I don’t know, I feel like I’ve wanted to get out there for a while now, but now the chance has actually seemed to present itself, I’ve suddenly realised all these things that A) my comfort zone is being single because I’ve been so my whole life, and B) I think I won’t look exactly how he expected. I’m just thinking down the line here - I’m telling myself that this is a bad idea, but then I also kinda want to see how this date goes, but then what if it doesn’t go well, I have no idea how to end stuff like this. 

He’s really nice, and I don’t want to be seen as leading him on.

I also have literally no idea how to act for a date, or what to wear, or how you continue stuff after that.

If we ever were to actually date, I don’t feel comfortable letting my family know, but they’d get suspicious when I’m traveling so far away because like I said he lives a while away. I’m also bad at showing affection, in my opinion I only really look good when I put an effort in.

I think I really struggle with self esteem - I could go and order a coffee somewhere, and I start thinking about how I could’ve done better during the interaction. Or I get worried that other people see my (physical) features differently to me, maybe for better or for worse I’ll never know. ",1,1767059492.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Wandering with no direction

Under the influence with nothing else to do 

Smoking the cheapest pre roll I could find

With a beautiful name, something floral

Something borrowed and something burnt. 

Inhaling with too much haste and not enough pleasure

Coughs echoing off the buildings

Cutting through the sound of traffic,

Beeps and steam rising from the tunnels underground,

The mighty roar and whimpers of the subways below my feet,

Snippets of phone calls as people walk by,

Making more eye contact than I asked for.

I start chewing the collar of my shirt,

Tasting some sort of shame that’s been passed down 

Since my grandpa freaked out and left the Catholic church.

Shame I carry between my teeth.

A beaten bear in a circus,

Fed through the wires of a pen.

The New Year is supposed to inspire something 

Some sort of revelation 

Or maybe some sort of mourning

Certainly some sort of discomfort 

In knowing that I didn’t do it right

And what I did right I could have done better 

And what I did better I didn’t do well enough.

I can see the clouds in the puddles of the street

And leaking fluids from the garbage bags lined against the curbs

And I hear a young man playing a guitar

And the sound of coins dropping in an open case.

You’re gonna make it big, kid. 

You’re a star. 

I feel yesterday’s paper blow past my shoes 

Next to a crumpled coffee cup sleeve. 

Old news, artifacts of the morning before. 

One that I slept through. 

I see a pigeon ruffled from the cold in a doorway.

And I taste a bitterness that signals I’ve reached the end of my bouquet. 

Marching on. Here comes the bride. 

I’ve been quite lonely,

But I could use some time in the altar of a church anyways. 

I feel a heat on my fingers that makes me wince. 

And I can almost see a way out of it.

And into something more meaningful. 

Through the movement of the street 

And the hustle of the people

Who have somewhere to go.

Maybe I can hitch a ride. 

Instead, I turn into an empty sidewalk.

Probably by accident, though you can never tell. 

Away from the eyes of the city 

And its passersby 

Where their concern and judgement are inextricable 

And in their union I find guilt. 

The last ember falls

The ash dissipates into the air 

And somehow even in my burnt out state,

There’s too much smoke to see clearly.

1pz4wdw,https://i.redd.it/1wxwuhzxu8ag1.png,Beginning...,"As a bit of an inauguration for this community, I thought I'd share some pieces of interactive fiction that either \*are\* or \*are close\* to modern visual novels, and talk a bit about why they are or are not part of the medium. Entries are written in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order.

*VA-11 Hall-A*: Aside from *Everything I Know, and Everything I'm Ever Gonna Know*, this is the most clear-cut example of a modern visual novel. Reading of text \*is\* the primary interaction, obstacles \*do\* branch but never reverse the user's progress... It doesn't even need to invoke rule #3!

*Enjoy the Diner*: Aesthetically, this piece certainly does give the vibes a modern visual novel should. Mechanically, reading is also the user's primary mode of interaction. The only problem is the adventure game style lock-and-key puzzle design, which has constant potential for halting the user's progress (rule #2). I wouldn't quite say this falls into rule #3 either, as the narrative intent is rather hazy... However, if one were to simply look at its Steam page, one very easily could mistake *Enjoy the Diner* as a modern visual novel.

*Everything I Know, and Everything I'm Ever Gonna Know*: This is made by... me. With the specific intent of being a modern visual novel, as well. And thus, it easily fits into the modern visual novel medium. It adheres to all three rules, but does call on rule #3 in one area: the baseball tutorial section.

*Coffee Talk:* This piece perhaps has more shallow mechanical depth than is typical of a modern visual novel, yet it can't be denied that it follows all 3 rules that place it as yet another clear example of a modern visual novel.

*Refind Self:* It's actually been a while since I've read this one... I remember thinking it was rather modern visual novel like, but I'd be curious if anyone has thoughts as to whether this is or isn't a modern visual novel.",1,1767059095.0,modernvisualnovels,0,1.0,False

**EP.3 Girl-Proximity Protocol​**

  
Two NERV outfitted figures flanked him. Their MAC-10s slung, fingers indexed along the receivers, safety off, not aiming. That courtesy kept the open elevator at the bottom of the pyramid HQ from devolving into a mess. Instead, it was an infinitely gentle standoff. Sarlo and Gendo faced each other for several moments. The NERV soldiers looked nervous. Misato was staring at this scene of the accident behind Sarlo's shoulder.  
  
**Sarlo:** Now you're late.  
  
There was no reaction from him. The guards shifted, uneasy. Misato lingered half a step in her spotless jacket uniform.  
  
**Misato:** This hardened soldier is soft, Commander, he cannot harm you.  
**Sarlo:** Microfractures have turned me into a nice guy.  
  
He flexed his fingers once, testing his grip strength, before resigning and resting shoulder side his frame on the steel elevator wall. He'd be incapable even if he didn't need medical patches behind his ears feeding him anti inflammatories.  
  
**Gendo:** I know his situation. Make way.  
  
They stepped back, the soldiers stepped in clearing a path. Gendo walked between them, back turned, creating a no man's land measured in centimeters. The soldiers looked and acted expendable, clearly boots. The one closest to Sarlo held his SMG like it weighed a thousand pounds, tucked to his chest - not pointing fully downwards.  
  
Sarlo whispered the quietest ""*Hey*"" he could. They locked eyes. He motioned: point that thing down. The soldier didn't blink, but slowly, imperceptibly, he stopped flagging Sarlo. Gendo turned, not his body, just his head. He made no acknowledgement.  
  
The doors opened, and Sarlo realized the briefing wouldn't be held in the cavernous command center. Instead a smaller executive lounge, overlooking the Geofront's artificial lake. Dark leather couches arranged in a loose square, low glass table between them. Upscale. Almost comfortable. The kind of room where bad news gets delivered with coffee. And in the middle, Kozo Fuyutsuki had prepared some for them.  
  
**Kozo:** Gentlemen! Sit.  
  
He and Gendo approached the couches in the middle and took their seats. Misato and Kozo stayed up, the soldiers remained by the elevator, and Sarlo sank into the far side of the leather couch. It was soft and deep, a warm garment swallowing him. For a moment he let it take his weight, eyes half closed. Then he caught himself, leaned forward, elbows on knees. His hands reached forward and grabbed a cup, sipping it.  
  
**Gendo:** I have read of your service, and heard of it to be important.  
**Kozo:** Sterling record. Some of it being bold.  
**Sarlo:** Just a lowly Lance-Corporal. You know, I've been trying to chase that rank.  
  
He sighed a bit, suggesting a heart flatter.  
  
**Sarlo:** Chasing that rank kept me busy. Requires taking actual presence sometimes.  
  
He just had to do it. Even a grin tempted out, and he eyed Gendo for a second, wishing for him to bite his tongue. If there was even a prick under that skin, it didn't appear.  
  
**Gendo:** We took notice. You are now a pilot.  
**Kozo:** Sarlo, we are understandable of your frustrations.  
**Sarlo:** Let me guess, now that I am up, you want to make sure I never sit down?  
**Misato:** You are not doing this for Gendo.  
  
Sarlo glanced at her, then back at Gendo. For a moment he thought him tired, like they had dragged dear Uncle along with the couches up here just to assure him.  
  
**Sarlo:** Alright. Uncle?  
**Gendo:** Kozo, you're free.  
**Kozo:** What do you need to know?  
**Sarlo:** What's an angel?  
**Kozo:** Extraterrestrial entities of unknown origin.  
**Sarlo:** So...  
**Misato:** Aliens.  
**Kozo:** Thank you Captain, but I can answer. Their motives remain unclear. Behavioral pattern indicates they aim to penetrate beneath the Geofront. For operational purposes, treat them as hostile strategic threats with adaptive capabilities.  
**Sarlo:** Patterns on the time-table. Next arrival?  
**Kozo:** That is unknown. It could be tomorrow, it could be months.  
**Sarlo:** Fire support?  
**Kozo:** All conventional units at the top. Tokyo-3's has been specifically designed for it. It has retractable buildings, elevated highways, and underground tunnels.  
**Sarlo:** So Tokyo-3's basically a kill-box for me and the army.  
**Gendo:** You're our final redundancy.  
  
Sarlo straightened slightly.  
  
**Sarlo:** Hold on, why not evacuate the civilians? Turn the whole city into glorified barracks with me and army units in it.  
**Gendo:** It already is.  
**Sarlo:** It is?  
**Kozo:** All the civilians in Tokyo-3 work for NERV. All the kids in schools are theirs, all the nightclubs and restaurants serve them.  
**Sarlo:** So there's no such thing as collateral anymore. Just... co-workers.  
  
He took to deep thought for a moment, gaze aimed to the side, focusing nowhere. They awaited further reactions.  
  
**Sarlo:** What happens if I fail? What's so important down here in the Geofront that—  
**Kozo:** We know they want what we have. What we have is non-negotiable.  
**Sarlo:** Is it non-negotiable for you to tell me about it?  
**Kozo:** We can't, it's beyond our control.  
  
Sarlo turned to Gendo.  
  
**Sarlo:** We? You got a mouse in your pocket?  
  
He was met with a quiet stare, but this wasn't out of respect. From every briefing he'd ever sat through he knew that 'need to know' meant 'we have no idea' half the tim. But the sour cherry commander had to know what was going on… right?  
  
**Sarlo:** ...Wait. You actually *don't k*now, do you?  
**Gendo:** I don't.  
  
That was a holy shit moment for him. Gendo didn't know. Singular. Not plural. It was the first time he had heard him take, no veil of institution to hide from. He couldn't even tell if it was an employed truth to make any lies tolerable.  
  
**Sarlo:** Ok. A fallback line and some cigarettes is all I'm asking for then.  
  
To it, he fished one out from inside his jacket, placing it between his lips. No lighter - he'd been counting on someone else, yet Misato, once near, plucked the cigarette from his mouth.  
  
**Misato:** No smoking.  
**Sarlo:** Sorry, I'll do it outside.  
  
She stepped even close, violating his personal perimeter, startling him slightly, and pulled the entire pack from the inside of his jacket.  
  
**Misato:** No. Smoking.  
  
She crushed the pack, with the authority of a commanding officer. Sarlo stared at her hand, short nailed, practical, cute even, then her face. He assumed in the future those would be his fingers if he ever got out of line.  
  
**Sarlo:** I must protest this arrangement.  
**Kozo:** It's a condition of employment.  
**Sarlo:** So I'm gear now. Got it. Gear doesn't smoke, gear doesn't shit without permission**.**  
**Kozo:** We cannot take the risk. The body that works for you works for us. Anything that corrupts its integrity, sadly, will be retired.  
**Sarlo:** I'm maintenance then. How do I get paid?  
**Gendo:** You won't be working.  
**Kogo:** Indeed. You will be compensated. An additional fifty thousand yen per week.  
**Sarlo:** That's… **(pauses to do mental math)** Sweet! Does that include housing?  
**Misato:** As a matter of fact, it does.  
**Kogo:** It took careful deliberation, but we found you proper housing.  
**Sarlo:** Where then?  
**Gendo:** With Captain Misato.  
  
For the first time Gendo made movement, picking up his coffee, carefully retaining his white silky gloves unstained, and took a sip. He eyed the cup uncaringly, while everyone else was staring. Sarlo turned to Misato. She didn't flinch, didn't blush. Her face as when she crushed the cigarettes, pretty little suit and all. He understood what his mission was now.  
  
**Sarlo:** I didn't know she needed a guardian.  
**Kozo chuckles:** No, she will be your handler.  
**Sarlo:** Ah huh…  
**Kozo:** Now, you may have some reservations.  
**Sarlo:** I have none.  
**Kozo:** Even if it's temporary, you surely have questions about it.  
**Sarlo:** Again, I don't.  
  
He was now unreadable to them. They had expected either gruntish resistance or palpable overjoyment. If their aim of settling this Lance Corporal counted on predictability, this easy resignation made it more difficult.  
  
**Sarlo:** I'm a grunt. A kept one. On all levels except physical, I am powerless. As much as you count on me, I count on you.  
  
Kogo paused. A reflection of the temporarily cloudless geofront sparked in his eyes, and he left his lips form just enough to stop them. He was, despite all his worldly knowledge, a bit out of his depth due to age. Sarlo, breathing through his mouth in bodily discomfort, lightly nodded.  
  
**Sarlo:** I get it is all I'm saying.  
  
He deep sipped his coffee one last time, then attempted to rise with visible effort. Misato stepped closer to help, only to be waved away. Without uttering a word, he went for the exit, one of the NERV soldiers ordering the elevator up for him.  
  
**Gendo:** Do you also get it Captain Misato?  
**Misato:** Yes Commander. I do.  
  
Misato and Sarlo entered the elevator and went down back home.  
  


==========================================================  
  
  
  
They were going up one of the apartment buildings, step by step, floor by floor. No elevator, and their room was on the 6th. Each hallway was a desert, empty apartments, late transfers, names without life on mailboxes, with a few inhabited patches inbetween. Pale, desaturated neon blue light above washed both of them, monitor in standby-mode feel. In assistance going up the steps was Misato by his side, palms around his back, helping his balance, pressure, posture. At points, he felt dependent on her on even how to breathe.  
  
**Misato:** There we go. You did it Sarlo.  
  
He was too severe and mighty a grunt to be talked like a six year old. Yet in that contest she was innocent, not pausing even for a little to give him not just a finger but a hand of help.  
  
**Misato:** Your knee was about to buckle.  
**Sarlo:** Please, it was easy  
**Misato:** I wanted to show you something you'd salute, you know. You sure like falling asleep on cushy seats.  
**Sarlo:** No, I don't…  
  
He lied. He really was exhausted, fighting strength low, pressing forward the last hallway. From the 6th, he could still see areas cordoned off beneath on street level, damaged areas whose crews still worked at night. They were walking down the final hallway towards a door with packages in its front.  
  
**Misato:** You know I've only moved in myself just weeks ago.  
**Sarlo:** So you lack friends like I do?  
**Misato:** No, I have friends who've moved in too. Oh, that's our room. It's the one with boxes with your name on it.  
**Sarlo:** Huh, so my stuff from Kumamoto is here?  
**Misato:** Along with your NERV pass and credit card. Paid and discharged.  
  
They approached the front door with a simple nameplate: M. Katsuragi. The PO box outside overflowed with envelopes and letters. Misato unlocked the door, the lights automatically flicking on. Sarlo still had his head turned, his body fatigued. Misato swirled around as she removed her shoes.  
  
**Misato:** Careful, hero. Don't trip on the way in.  
**Sarlo:** Hero?  
**Misato:** That's what the letters say ""Blessed man who saved Tokyo-3.""  
**Sarlo:** Saved. We drove past a block with a giant hole in it.  
**Misato:** Tokyo-3 would have been one giant hole were it not for you.  
**Sarlo:** Tell them to send whiskey instead. How many are there?  
**Misato:** I cleaned that box 4 hours ago. Why not step in and read them?  
**Sarlo:** Invite me into your home then, please.  
**Misato:** Come else I shove you in Sarlo.  
  
She closed her eyes and smirked with that line. Sarlo entered, the door shutting behind him, lock clicking. Misato heard him test the handle behind him, palming the door frames as well.  
  
**Sarlo:** I have more info on your house now then I do the angels.  
**Misato:** Oh, well… about my house.  
  
His eyes adjusted to the orange fluorescent light of her home. He removed his shoes, turning into the main living room. He looked past her shoulder.  
  
**Misato:** …yeah, it's a bit messy.  
  
She rubbed her head in embarrassment: cigarettes and ash on the floor, dirty clothes, Lawson and 7 Eleven bags all over the place. Alcohol bottles. A lot of them. Sarlo's eyes were on the floor, counting the beer bottles, not the mess.  
  
**Sarlo:** Misato, I get that clutter can be intimate. You have an excess of it.  
**Misato:** I just wanted to make it clear this wasn't a Barracks.  
**Sarlo:** It's clear alright…  
  
Misato went ahead to clean up the important parts of the house. Place looked like a room after a drill instructor found dust. He saw a half finished cigarette butt on the shelf next to him, picked it up, examined the lipstick on the filter. It was hers, and for a moment he thought of pocketing it - before he dropped it back up. If he was gonna have vices, they wouldn't be someone else's.  
  
**Sarlo:** Personally, I think Ozori's better for cheap booze. But Can Chu-Hi is solid  
  
He spoke with a bit more volume trying to chat with Misato, testing the acoustic too. He walked around the room, before stepping closer to the alcohol cabinet. He crouched, and opened it like he was inspecting a weapons rack.  
  
**Sarlo:** Let's see, Suntory Reserve, Camus Cognac, you have like three different types of Sauvignon blanc. You got Martini Vermouth -  
**Misato:** Martini & Rossi Vermouth!  
**Sarlo:** Vermouth's for mixing by the way, I better not catch you drinking it bare.  
**Misato:** I have Milk for that - and the Kahlua, I'm not that scandalous.  
  
He heard from the next room, before spotting a bottle of unopened Kahlua in the back. At least they wouldn't be drinking desperately.  
  
He had moved to the kitchen where there was the most space. Jacket off, shoulders relaxed, body still jagged. He couldn't sit, it'd feel like surrender, and he felt he had command of the space. He spotted two fridges as tall as him. There was a small freezer in the corner. Opening the first fridge, snacks - noodles, cheese sandwiches, family-pack rice and peanut crackers . Opening the second, Yesubu All-Malt beer, filled to the brim. She was eating and drinking like a grunt post-discharge.  
  
He was about to check the freezer too, but two steps in he paused. He started perking up. The boiler had cycled off, but water was running. Down the hall, he recognized somebody was in the bath, taking a shower.  
  
**Sarlo:** Misato, are you running a bath?  
**Misato:** Changing clothes. Give me a minute  
  
He heard her muffled voice from two doors down - which meant somebody he hadn't IDéd was inside the house. His hand was already in the drawer, palm sliding around a chef's knife handle. The drawer's left open, he exits the kitchen audiodirectionally. He saw steam through the edge frame of a door, which he assumed was occupied. He approached it, hugging the wall. The good tune of running water ceased with his final step. He could smell shampoo. He braced, and the sound of an unlocking door slid open.  
He had no time, he swung his body inward the threshold of the door. He was ready to pull in whoever it was with his free hand, and if necessary, strike them.  
  
Instead he saw nothing. There was something he was dwarfing instead. Looking down, he was met with something he'd only seen in books and on TV.  
  
**Sarlo:** Penguin??  
There it was, a penguin. It stared at Sarlo. Sarlo stared at the penguin. Fiery red tufts of feathers flared out from the top of his head, pink towel around his shoulders. He had on its neck a metal collar with the words 'Pen"" written on it.  
  
**Pen-Pen:** Squawk.  
  
The penguin did an upper body wiggle to shake off excess water, splashing his legs. He was still stuck in a combat stance when he turned to face Misato who just entered the hallway. Sleeveless yellow top, jeans so short and tight it was like she was going to the beach. She was carrying a basket with things in it. He heard meaty bird feet tapping on the wooden floor below as the Penguin strolled past him and towards the Misato.  
  
**Misato:** Oh oh! Sarlo, that's Pen-Pen.  
**Sarlo:** What?  
**Misato:** He's a warm-spring penguin.  
**Sarlo:** Christ, you have that now?  
**Misato:** Yes. Why are you holding a knife?  
  
She began closing the distance with him, basket resting against her pelvis held with one hand.  
  
**Sarlo:** I thought-  
**Misato:** Knife down. You thought wrong.  
  
She scooped the knife from his hands, encountering no resistance.  
  
**Misato:** Be nice to your roommate. He bites harder than he looks.  
  
He looked down at his empty hand. Then at the bathroom door still open, steam venting. He could smell lavender shampoo. Misato thrusted the basket she was holding. Clean clothes, folded with care.  
  
**Misato:** I think it's high time you enjoyed yourself as a bath Soldier.  
**Sarlo:** He hasn't clogged the drain or anything?  
**Misato:** Genetically modified short fur.  
  
He took a step closer, coming intimately close. He had his gaze downwards - not at her chest, but nowhere in particular.  
  
**Misato:** Lance Corporal. You've braved odds nobody else can purchase. Perhaps, after a warm bath, you'll join me to brave chow.  
  
He said nothing. He braved eye contact for a beat, before relaxing his shoulders. This wasn't defeat, Misato thought, but a cease-fire with his body. He appeared to gleam he had been on guard in case the horizon around ambushed him. Perhaps it was the pain that had made itself known again, now that he was aware and out of lock. He picked up the basket in front of him and Misato saw him enter the bathroom door, the door clicking shut, locking.  
  


==========================================================  
  
  
  
They stood in the blast shadow. Millions of plexiglass shards glittered on the floor like frozen rain. From their perch they overlooked the chamber below, control interfaces draped in black sheets, concealing whatever damage had already been done. Ritsuko's mouth was set in a thin line, her eyes serious but distant.  
  
**Ritsuko:** I understand that you visited Rei. How is she?  
**Gendo:** It will take 20 days for her to recover.  
  
He was still gazing into the middle distance. The lights hadn't been fixed yet, the lack of light laid a darker tribute to their words.  
  
**Ritsuko:** She was supposed to be our only back-bone. Our new pilot gives us options.  
**Gendo:** It was a last minute decision.  
**Ritsuko:** This soil you brought us - was it cultivated by you?  
**Gendo:** Irrelevant. Unit-01 will be ready before Rei is.  
**Ritsuko:** But we are lucky. It would be a bitter shade to send a child.  
**Gendo:** If there are sins, they fall only on me.  
  
Improbably so deep underground he felt a mosquito bite in his arm, yet he didn't bother to squash it. The sharp smell of burnt fuses lingered in the air. The understanding he offered - partial, deliberate - was meant to suffice. It usually did. Ritsuko recognized the mask and pressed anyway.  
  
**Ritsuko:** Why not Shinji?  
**Gendo:** It is easy to produce malicious creatures.  
**Ritsuko:** And the Lance Corporal can't become that?  
**Gendo:** He has been trained to fight a war with rifles, NOD's, tanks and artillery support. If we are to lose him, he will also lose himself.  
  
There was a finality to that statement, one of logistics, not ethics. Gendo dug his hands deeper in his pockets. Aboveground, the days were eternally bright and hot, but down here the air remained cold. His gaze drifted toward it - and still, he made no move to warm it.  
  
He was looking down the Chamber where Unit-000 was. It had sunk its arm violently against the wall, puncturing it, frozen mid-spasm. The hand was clenched around nothing. It looked less like an attack, and more like a reaction.  
  
  
  
==========================================================  


  
He smelled and felt well - to the extent a neurally disjointed pilot could. It lessened the effort it took to lift the heavy, filled bowl from the table with both hands. It touched his lips, body forward, head back, and the steady chug began. Misato's face was close by, checking his pupils. Her hand on his back not reassuring, pressuring. He could feel her thumb on his scapula, ready to push if he paused.  
  
His throat resisted this hot, bothersome march. The bowl raised, the eyes tension closed, the dark brown liquid lowered. Finally, with no more drops flowing the ordeal was over. He snapped forward, the bowl back down the table.  
  
**Misato:** Ah, that didn't taste well, did it?  
**Sarlo:** God, it alternates between good broth and stale cough syrup. What is it again?  
**Misato:** That's the neural regenerative compound. The one you paid for with your molars.  
**Sarlo:** How long do I have to keep taking it?  
**Misato:** Seven to ten. Until your Molars are at rest.  
  
He coughed a bit, then belched, tapping his chest lightly.  
  
**Sarlo:** Seven to ten?  
**Misato:** It's medicine, not logistics. Days are approximate.  
  
Which meant ten. Estimates are never in favor of infantrymen. His back shook again, a micro-spasm. Misato felt it come and go. She noted it in her notebook - his body wasn't rejecting the soup.  
  
**Sarlo:** …no cigarettes. No chewing gum either.  
**Misato:** Nope.  
  
She reached behind the milk carton, and unpeeled a patch, eyeing his body. He had a fresh JSDF PT shirt on, dark jeans sourced locally. The men's briefs she bought just for him. He was unfazed when a towel wiped sweat off his neck and Misato applied the patch.  
  
**Misato:** Nicotine patch.  
  
With the immediate risk past, her posture loosened. The clink of the microwave behind ceased the background hum. She got up, cheerfully. Sarlo palmed the patch. Already prickliness receded in parts, in others lately.  
  
She sat at bridge distance across the table, sodium coated potato TV Dinner in hand. Her iron spoon penetrated a sad piece, she blew air to cool before devouring - and enjoying it. It took several seconds for her to chug her all-malt. When she did, she let out a whizz  
  
**Misato:** Aha! Now that's the stuff.  
  
This was the most boot shit he's seen all week.  
  
**Sarlo:** Where's Pin-pin  
**Misato:** Pen-Pen dummy. On the second fridge. Don't bother him, he's sleeping.  
  
She pointed with her fork and he turned. Floor to ceiling height, vibrating hum. Didn't even clock it as a fridge. His hand tremored holding his back.  
  
**Sarlo:** Misato, why do I feel like I'm inside that freezer?  
**Misato:** The Neural soup will mess with your body temperature for a bit.  
  
He didn't tell her a library of images wind dusted whenever he closed his eyes. He turned to the slide of a calendar across the table, her hand leaving a pen on top of it.  
  
**Sarlo:** This is?  
**Misato:** Chores. Mark the task and the days.  
**Sarlo throws it to her:** What is this the fucking Barracks, won't you be doing it all.  
**Misato throws it back:** We're roommates Sarlo. It's your home after all too.  
**Sarlo looking over it:** Fine… you put yourself cook for the first week?  
**Misato:** Can't take the chance you won't try and taste your work.  
**Sarlo:** Why is 'rectal thermometer temp test' on the schedule?  
**Misato:** You're a marine, you'll eat the oral one.  
**Sarlo clicking the pen:** Funny. I'm putting myself on cleaning duty. Bathroom, Kitchen, Floors and windows.  
**Misato:** What about laundry?  
**Sarlo:** We split, yours is yours, mine is mine. Ain't touching your underwear.  
**Misato:** I'll be doing trash take out. You gather it, I'll discard it.  
**Sarlo:** So is grocery and cooking - if you cook at all.  
**Misato:** I am a many-skilled woman Sarlo  
  
He set the calendar down next to her condiment packets and got up. A spine stretch followed, a few more glances. He eyed the beer can tower on one of the shelves, then headed towards the living room.  
  
**Misato:** You don't have to start now, silly.  
  
He didn't answer. His body landed back first on the couch. Soft, cushy, soiled from his sweat. His back was a boiler, his front a night desert. Yet both combined in the outline of his figure to make him feel content.  
  
**Sarlo:** What's that on the table?  
**Misato:** Letters of appreciation. 1st and 2nd Tokyo-3 Municipal school, including extras.  
**Sarlo:** Just letters? No gifts?  
**Misato:** It was explicitly denied, they'd send food and booze - and damage your mouth. But how I cry for the unsend chocolate and candy.  
  
He heard her open a second can of all-malt. There had to be at least 100 letters inside the five boxes on top of the kotatsu. He reached forward - grabbed a handful, and tipped one box over, letters spilling out. He tore one open and read aloud.  
  
**Sarlo:** I wrote and wrote and wrote and then wrote some more. But I can't describe how speechless you left us when we saw the aftermath in the streets. You send that monster lane-first back to heaven. I hope you send the next ones to hell. Thank you for saving us, signed, Hikari Horaki, of 1st Municipal School, Class A-2.  
**Misato:** Aww, that's so sweet.  
**Sarlo:** Sweeter than anything I ever received in the army.  
  
He set it aside, another letter opened.  
  
**Sarlo:** Sarlo, you're the coolest. They drenched an angel in 155mm artillery fire, and that barely made it cough. Not even the US F-30s could touch it, but what were they thinking bringing it so close to ground level? Those things cost twenty-nine million a piece, and the radar alone can blow out windows when it spins up. Furthermor-  
**Misato:** Oh geez, this kid is on a roll.  
**Sarlo:** He has two - no wait - three paragraphs talking about the T-63 and its smooth bore barrel. Gotta admit, he's thought about it. Skipping to the end… he wants us to try and use Tiger 2 tanks?  
**Misato:** Huh? Aren't those last century,  
**Sarlo:** His name is Kensuke Aida, 1st Municipal School, Class A-2. I hope he makes selection, smart kid.  
**Misato:** Future NERV tank commander Aida.  
**Sarlo:** He better stop growing then, tanks are space constrained.  
  
The next letter, he skimmed, stopped, then skimmed again. Misato noticed him, taking more than a few seconds. Sarlo's jaw tightened reading, voice flat with anger.  
  
**Sarlo's:** To the low-down schmuck drunk driving the Evangelion, the butcher of Tokyo-3-  
  
He made it three more words before his throat closed, and he realized what he was reading. Misato had stopped chomping on food and had turned to him. He continued.  
  
**Sarlo:** I hope you choke on your food. You fought a skeleton corpse and still got your ass almost beat. I do better with my dick. If it was me it'd have taken one punch to knock that sucker down.  
  
Misato made a strangled sound and clamped a hand over her mouth. He squinted, mouth open in amazement.  
  
**Sarlo:** In fact, they should send me. I'd send them packing so hard they'd be making their own version of NERV when I invade their planet and hang them upside down.  
  
Misato slammed her palm on the table.  
  
**Sarlo:** I'll make sure nobody's sister gets hurt too, you prick. Rot in hell, signed Toji Suzuhara.  
  
He was giving out disbelieving huff laughs when Misato's wheezes broke into burst laughter. She almost knocked the milk carton to the floor trying to wipe tears in her eyes.  
  
**Misato:** The balls. The sheer, unmitigated balls on this brat.  
**Sarlo:** Holy shit. Did he really mail this?  
**Misato:** Make sure he didn't put anthrax in it. My god.  
**Sarlo:** I'm sending him NJP paperwork. Failure to respect a superior. Excessive confidence.  
**Misato:** As if that kid's ever gonna be a soldier.  
**Sarlo:** If I die, you better read this at my funeral.  
  
He folded the letter carefully. Not to keep. To file. It was going next to his orders and his will. He leaned again and grabbed another handful of letters. He was intent on reading every single one of them now.  
  
  
==========================================================

  
  
The heat hadn't lifted with nightfall. The summer clung to the city like a held breath. It had done for the last 15 years. The bus hissed to a stop, in a street right in the middle of Tokyo-3. A man stepped off wearing camouflage trousers, boots, and a jacket that had once been flak. White hair. No insignia. Kozo didn't offer his hand, but the man raised his in a lazy salute.  
  
**Corporal:** You must be Kozo - apologies, Professor Kozo?  
**Kozo:** Your reputation requires no prolonging, corporal.  
**Corporal:** Fifteen years and counting, although half of it was training men to avoid death.  
**Kozo:** I've been sent to greet you - there's a rice place for a warm meal, nearby. Do follow me.  
  
Kozo nodded and turned. The shop was narrow and fluorescent, its windows fogged from steam. Two bowls were set between them. Kozo ate neatly, methodically. The man beside him ate as if commanding a tank, chopsticks moving with efficient violence.  
  
**Kozo:** You must have been in the militias after Second impact.  
  
The Corporal paused, chopsticks hovering.  
  
**Corporal:** I don't like talking about that .  
**Kozo nodding:** I meant no prompting. There were a lot of kids running around back those days.  
**Corporal:** I was one of those kids, professor, I don't wear that stripe anymore.  
**Kozo:** You wear the NERV stripe now.  
**Corporal:** Before that it was the Gerign, JSSDF's 2nd Battalion, the Pitirak Militia.  
**Kozo:** You've lived in interesting times.  
**Corporal:** Oh please. I'm just a free man in an age where free men are killed.  
  
His gaze drifted to the shop's CRT, looping a predetermined news segment. Outside, cleanup crews were beginning to withdraw, hoses coiling, lights dimming. People passed in ones and twos, returning to their apartments as if nothing extraordinary had happened. In the amber streetlight, the splashes of alien matter looked almost deliberate.  
  
**Corporal:** Physics accidents don't leave such cleanup crews.  
**Kozo:** Yes. The NERV report you were given was....  
**Corporal:** Padded. The inward eye that sees my heart told me it was. Moreover, from what I understand, you built something that also bleeds. An Evangelion  
**Kozo:** You seem more informed than I expected.  
**Corporal:** True knowledge can never be achieved, but my opsec is legendary  
**Kozo:** You speak as if certainty were a luxury  
**Corporal:** I don't blame you for thinking that. We are punished in far excess of our sins.  
**Kozo:** Some more than others, and some more opinionated. Why mention it.  
**Corporal:** Because of the sense of it. The buildings are built, the pipes installed and working, the roads paved, there's police around to protect us. I came from places where none of that survived.  
  
He paused eating to taste the lemon in his gums and tongue.  
  
**Corporal:** It's strange. Citizens of the same Union still butcher one another… while Apostles descend from heaven, ready to finish the job.  
  
He spoke not in amazement or disbelief. It was as if he had already accepted that the truth was an instrumental narrative.  
  
**Kozo:** Quite silly  
**Corporal:** It is silly, yet it commanded my presence.  
**Kozo:** Now you are here.  
**Corporal:** Yes.  
**Kozo:** For what reason.  
  
He finished licking the last of the rice bowl before he set it down.  
  
**Corporal:** Somebody needs my presence. Not my skill. Not my rank. My presence.  
**Kozo: (studying him)** Is it?  
**Corporal:** Being here is enough.  
  
  
==========================================================  
  
  
  
His room was bare, and he was sitting down on his futon. He felt injured, but the soup took away the need for crutches. Still this weight, this created emptiness. He longed for hunger to occupy his thoughts. He was staring at this apartment ceiling instead.  
  
The dividing wall door opened, and Misato stood there, already half-changed for bed. Tank top, sleep shorts, towel over one shoulder. She hadn't left.  
  
**Misato:** Aw, does this soldier not sleep when given a bed?  
**Sarlo:** I piloted an EVA, shut up. I'll get a CD player tomorrow, I'll fall asleep to that.  
  
He had no malice in his voice. She hadn't left. Still laying down he turned to face her.  
  
**Misato:** Some of the sensations are natural if you want to know. Fat loss mostly. Sync feedback eats a lot of calories.  
**Sarlo:** Why mention that?  
  
They exchanged glances, then she followed her stare. Having plopped on the bed, half his bottom chest was open. She was looking at his abs. He raised a smirk tugging his blouse up. He had the tightness, with a bit of fat now in his system. Still lean, still with a good chest, a bit of hair in all the right places. He didn't hold it for long before he turned away.  
**Sarlo:** Don't get the wrong idea.  
**Misato:** I wasn't.  
**Sarlo:** I'm - oh, you should know.  
**Misato:** Why, oh? Is admiring beef fraternization with superior now.  
**Sarlo:** Could be in the army.  
**Misato:** You're NERV. We have different regs. **(pauses)** But you're right. I was auditing your body mass index. Sync tests require a baseline.  
**Sarlo:** You could've just asked.  
**Misato:** You would've lied. Soldiers lie about injuries.  
  
He didn't answer. Apparently she wasn't teasing him beneath a church, or sunning him with admiration. It was a physical state report, so she claimed. Soldiers have different saints than officers.  
  
**Sarlo:** Misato, what the fuck is an EVA? What am I piloting?  
**Misato:** You are piloting a human-made weapon, Sarlo.  
**Sarlo:** I thought I was the weapon.  
**Misato:** Well, don't they love weapons intimately? Rifles and fun and all.  
**Sarlo:** Don't believe that boot camp shit. The rifle isn't a man's girlfriend. The rifle is an instrument, a tool you point at enemy troops, cities and villages. You clean it, you respect it, but you don't love it.  
  
He'd talked with too much frustration. Even if justified it felt aimless to both of them. Misato kept staring at the soldier.  
  
**Misato:** For what it's worth, the weapon is lucky to have you.  
**Sarlo (turning away):** I'm going to sleep.  
  
She didn't respond. The door clicked shut, the lights went off. In the dark, he lay not thinking about Misato's eyes on his chest. He clenched his arm, and winced when he felt the lag. Hand. Weapon. Pilot. He couldn't tell which was which anymore.  
  
  
==========================================================  
  
  
It was the late hour in Tokyo-3, when the flow of the city flowed narrow to convenience stores and sleep. Beneath it, in the Geofront, the night remained awake. Makoto Hyuga wasn't part of the night crew. He stood anyway, headset pressed to one ear, eyes fixed on a scrolling feed. Dr. Ritsuko Akagi stood beside him, arms folded, her own headset low around her neck. Makoto spoke to his mic. They had stayed up late just for this.  
  
**Makoto:** Oso-2, confirm transmission integrity.  
**Oso-2:** Positive. Submarine recon transmitting dual-band sonar. Two separate returns.  
**Makoto:** Roger. Receiving.  
  
The printer whirred to life, sheets inching out one by one. Ritsuko pulled them free as they printed, laying them side by side on the console.  
  
**Ritsuko:** Low-frequency… high-frequency… SRT normal…  
  
Ritsuko leaned closer.  
  
**Makoto:** You don't think this is background noise.  
**Ritsuko:** I don't think it is Doctor.  
  
She traced a finger along the jagged curve of one readout. It dipped, then rose. She kept rereading it. She had seen this before. It was similar to Sarlo's sync readouts during combat.  
  
**Makoto:** Forty kilometers offshore by the way. Oso-2, return depth.  
**Oso-2:** Minimum estimate… six thousand meters. Possibly deeper.  
  
**Makoto:** That's below-  
**Ritsuko:** \-continental shelf, yes.  
  
She didn't sound impressed. She sounded resigned.  
  
**Ritsuko:** We only have a single angel profile. This could be Wigner distribution interference, or it could just be nothing.  
**Makoto:** We're feeding it to the Magi?  
**Ritsuko:** Do so immediately.  
  
Makoto keyed commands on his screen, then picked up a landline to call central tactical command. Ritsuko came close to the comms screen, pressing the controls to bring up the surface ship camera Oso-1 was attached to. The dark wine sea beat against the vessel.  
  
Somewhere far below the ocean floor, an angel moved.

There were moments in the exam where I felt marginally confused, but strategies from Mike, Andrew and John from destination certification helped. I can boil it down to ""You need to identify keywords in the question and read the question at least 3 times"".

 Quantum exams is the go to resource for practice, but keep in mind that you may get very different questions in the exam. But it teaches you to read the question properly. While studying, you also need to understand the process/framework/lifecycle, and in the correct sequence. 

In my opinion, it is a managerial exam but you need solid technical expertise as well. This is where the 5 year experience requirement helps.

 I have over 8 years experience in industry in mostly technical roles, so studying for the exam enabled me to switch my mindset to a broarder manegerial mindset, while the technical background certainly helped to answer some of the questions.

Pro tip: Try not to schedule your exam at 8 am in the morning like me, the major risk for me was needing strong coffee to stay awake and maybe needing a bathroom break in the middle of the exam!

Two years ago, I relocated for a job and decided to rent my house instead of selling it. She was ready to move out of her parents’ house and wanted to rent it. We both felt comfortable with the arrangement.

I charged her only enough to cover the mortgage, didn’t charge a security deposit, and handled all maintenance. Things went well for about a year.

She was then fired from her job. She reassured me she’d be fine on rent, though I felt she dragged her feet applying to jobs. Six months later, her unemployment ran out and she took a part-time retail job. She asked me to cut rent in half for a few months. I agreed, explaining I’d be paying out of pocket and could only do it for three months. She agreed. (Side note: she refused to sell her car despite an $800/month payment and having access to a free one.)

Two months later, she told me she wouldn’t be able to make rent beyond the next month and would need to move out. We agreed September would be her last month and I again cut rent in half.

In mid-August, she suddenly told me she’d be out by the end of August. I had just listed the house and wasn’t confident I could find a tenant on two weeks’ notice. She shut off the utilities and told me she’d be out that weekend.

I told her I’d still need the half September rent unless I found someone sooner (the lease was through November) and asked if she could keep utilities in her name briefly so I wouldn’t pay start-up fees. She said she wasn’t paying for something she wasn’t using and didn’t like my tone. I apologized and explained my frustration after already being flexible and paying out of pocket. She didn’t respond. She left a bunch of things at the house that I had to take care of too. 

We met for coffee weeks later and it was awkward. After that, she didn’t invite me on our annual trip or her birthday dinner, removed me from some socials, and hasn’t spoken to me since.

What’s your take? What do you think her narrative is? I feel like I did everything I could to preserve the friendship, and it hurts that she cut me off. I feel taken advantage of — and I lost a friend and a lot of money.",1,1767058262.0,FriendshipAdvice,3,1.0,False

(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post! Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Duet Night Abyss, One Step from Eden, and Rune Factory 4. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

My rules are simple. 

- Don't buy anything I don't need to survive or I already have.

- Limit my takeaway coffee like I've already been doing (only one coffee per week).

- No subscriptions.

- Only re-buy stuff that I already use and know they work for me. 

- No food deliveries.

I'll keep doing my hair and laser appointments and of course keep my gym membership. The main goal though is not to shop anything. I have to add that I live with my parents so I don't grocery shop and don't pay any bills except for my motorcycle insurance and road tax. I also have a very limited monthly budget that I try to keep up with. I am planning to use this thread as a way to keep myself accountable for my no-buy. :)",11,1767058126.0,nobuy,1,1.0,False

I’m at a bit of a loss of words over here. I think I’m gearing up for another round of treatment and am feeling a bit confused. I’ve been a mystery patient since 2006 and the things I have gone through before figuring out I had neuro Lyme were heavy. I figured out the Lyme piece a few years ago, and since then have gone through several rounds of doxy and self treated with Bruhners. I have yet to see a Lyme literate doctor and will be self treating again. Being a mystery patient has destroyed me financially and I simply can’t afford it. So, like many on this sub, I shall go on LLMD-less.

This disease has definitely earned the name “the great imitator” because damn if it isn’t confusing to pinpoint. I know for me, it tends to play in the background mimicking my other conditions. Is it my head injuries, mold exposure, or old spine injuries acting up? Maybe I’m not trying hard enough or perhaps it’s mental? Am I standing in my own way? I can never tell, so I tend to push harder. 

I’m currently at a place where I’m usually sleeping 9-12 hours a night of solid sleep, but wake up EXHAUSTED and can’t seem to get going even after several cups of coffee. My mind is like a sieve, retaining nothing regardless of how hard I try or repeat what I need to remember. I frequently forget what I’m doing or why. My bones hurt and I’ve been experiencing an uptick in psychiatric symptoms. I think it’s time for another round of treatment. 

I’m newish at this and don’t know what it looks like to live long term with this condition along side treatment. What has your experience been? It’s been over a year since I last treated. What’s your treatment regimen look like? How long are you on vs. off? I know the answer to all this will vary from person to person, I’d just like to hear others experiences.
