**Why This Pick?**

3 of the last 4 encounters between these two teams have seen more than 234.5 points, friends. In addition, Atlanta has cashed the Over in 4 of their last 5 outings, and Charlotte is playing exceptional basketball at the moment. If the Hornets plan on keeping up with the Hawks’ notoriously quick pace (like they did less than a week ago…), this game should cash the Over easily. My money’s on a high-scoring affair.

1r22pgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1r22pgj/barcelona_vs_valencia_i_lived_in_both_3_months_so/,Barcelona vs Valencia : I lived in both 3 months so here's the real comparison,"3 months Barcelona then 3 months Valencia. I write code for a US company so I needed decent timezone overlap with EST. Tracked all my spending because I'm like that. This question shows up here every week so here's what I actually spent.

Finding an apartment in Barcelona sucked. Took 2 weeks on Idealista. Ended up in Eixample near Passeig de Gràcia, 1BR, €1,270/mo. Monthly total came to about €2,700 with everything (food, metro, coworking at MOB Bailén for €250, gym at DIR for €57, eating out, etc). Valencia was way easier. Found a place in Ruzafa through a Facebook group for €1,020. Monthly total more like €2,400. Thats €900 saved over 3 months. A flight to anywhere basically.

Beer in Barcelona €4.50-5. Valencia €3.50. Coffee about the same. Groceries the same because Mercadona is Mercadona.

Internet both 270mbps fiber. Spain just has this figured out.

Got pickpocketed 5 weeks into Barcelona. Green line (L3), rush hour at Passeig de Gràcia. Someone bumped me, didn't notice my phone was gone until Diagonal. Actually got it back because Find My showed it still in the station, they must have dropped it when they saw it was locked. After that I was checking my pockets every 5 minutes. Always watching my bag in Raval at night. In Valencia I walked home at 1:30am through the center and didn't think about it once. My girlfriend visited for 2 weeks and said the same thing, she felt totally fine walking alone.

Used Wayco in Valencia for coworking, €150/mo. Better than MOB honestly. Newer, less packed in the mornings when I actually work.

I ate at Mercat Central in Valencia like 3x a week. Probably skews my numbers but the food there for the price is stupid good. Barcelona has more international restaurants and fancier options. I mostly cook at home and eat out for lunch though so Valencia worked better for me. There was this spot near my apartment, Bar Ricardo, menú del día €12 with wine. Same thing in Barcelona runs €15-16 and its usually worse.

Went out way more in Barcelona the first 6 weeks. More people, more events, more stuff on Meetup and Lemon. Valencia is smaller. More local. More Spanish which was harder for me since my Spanish is mid. Got invited to some things through the Wayco community but its a different energy.

The thing nobody warns you about is how the tourists in Barcelona grind you down over time. Even Gràcia which is supposed to be the local neighborhood has segway tours going through it now. In Valencia I went days without feeling like a foreigner in a tourist trap. Sounds like nothing but 3 months in it matters a lot.

I'm back in Valencia now writing this. Do with that information what you want. Barcelona is a great city I'm not trashing it. But for sitting down and getting work done every day without burning cash or getting stressed out, this worked better for me.

1r22o7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r22o7g/aitah_this_is_a_lot_my_apologies_ahead_of_time/,"AITAH This is a lot, my apologies ahead of time, but I'm so lost.","Greetings and salutations. I've searched every direction for answers and truthfully my own doubts and questions have led me here. Normally I don't do this, so a touch of forgiveness would be greatly appreciated.

The story (its a long read, because its a lot of damage).

Once upon a time I was a homeless addict and alcoholic, wandering the country with simply a backpack and absolutely no clue, or any real desire to settle down or make any real connections. Given my mental health and my past it seemed the best course of action. Was it the wisest or best decision? I don't know. Somewhere within this vast six years of willingly choosing to be homeless and not really address any of my internal problems I met a woman. Now I'm from a broken home, both parents addicts and a large amount of violence  and crime, so needless to say I wasn't your typical role model for a stable home life, or to be a parent, or a partner. Not because I didn't have this need for such things, but moreseo because I had zero reference on even how to do it. Then she came along. She was a single mother of a disabled child, and three other children that were essentially fatherless, and spent more time with their grandparents than really her or any father figure. She had her own struggles with addiction and a terrible upbringing. Now I won't say that any particular thing was the catalyst but a few things stick out. Her youngest was cutting teeth, and just crying his eyes out, at times for hours, and I don't know, it just did something to me. Now a lot of people with ptsd will openly tell you crying children can really upset them. For me though? In that moment, at that strange juncture in my life, for some unexplainable reason, I picked him up, I held him close, and I walked for hours simply holding him. And he stopped crying. He held onto me, and I held onto him, and something deep inside of me felt a tiny bit of peace. His mother and I weren't officially anything at that point. She had one boy that spent a lot of time in the hospital, and the other children were either at their grandmother's or grandfather's. I had no intentions of it being anything more than two lost souls spending some time together. Truthfully, for a long time my plans were solely focused on taking my own life, and strangely enough I had already worked out the plan and the place and was actually hiking my way that direction when I ran into her. We spent more and more time together. The kids, even in their most chaotic of moments calmed a lot of the raging emotions in my head. Her presence gave me some sort of undefined comfort in a world where everyone else had walked away from me (not to say that in some circumstances I deserved them to walk away, but not all of them). So I was used to everyone leaving, and openly said that. 'Everyone leaves' was my mantra. So don't get to close. Don't hold on. Don't believe in anyone and dont rely on or trust them. I was homeless as a kid, and eventually homeless as an adult. Needless to say time passed, we grew closer, her situation was bad and she was struggling, and my situation was obviously beyond bad. But she needed me. They needed me. And they actually wanted me around! Which was so vastly different than what I was used to. So we fell into living together. It's the only way I can describe it, because nothing about it was planned. Many nights, for reasons I know better now, I would stand up, grab my stuff, and head to the door. Not because of an argument. Not because anyone had done or said anything at all that would cause it. But because my brain said 'time to go'. And she would stand at the door and tell me 'No. You're not going anywhere. We love you.' To hear someone say that to you when your entire life no one had said it all, well let me tell you, it healed so much in me. For the first time someone was fighting for me. I am loyal to a fault. When I care for people, or love them, well, you have to drive me away before I'll go. I'm nowhere near perfect, but when it comes to having my friends' and family's back? You call, I'm coming. Yet I had never really gotten that. Well here it was. Staring me in the face. This small, fierce woman standing there looking up at me leaving zero doubt she'd fight me if need be but I was going to be loved, and to take my ass and sit back down. It took me two years before I said I loved her. Two years this woman would stand there and say I deserved to be loved, I deserved to have a family, and I deserved some peace in my life. Now to some that might seem kind of insane. I mean it does to me after reading it. But deep down I think we both knew I wasn't going anywhere, and that my mental illness was controlling so many aspects of who I was at that point. So we made a home. Kids running crazy everywhere, me learning how to be a dad and a good partner, and eventually a husband. We spent twelve years together, got clean, got a nice home, cars, money, everything and anything we would all want. I watched her settle into being a person that could trust that I wasn't going anywhere, and I finally came to believe that there was one person, one person on this entire planet, that wouldn't leave me. If only I could say that now. We had our struggles. Drama, fights, petty arguments, other people trying to pull her away and doing the same with me, but always it was us versus the world. We'll figure it out, became our battle cry. We moved out of where we met, found a home in a small town, got our kids in the fresh air and away from the craziness and sadly drugs, that comes with a lot of the city life, and would sit on our porch swing early in the morning drinking coffee and laughing together, and it would echo through the neighborhood. It was every dream I never knew I had come true. Until it wasn't. One morning her phone kept going off and that wasn't a normal occurence for either of us, so being concerned, because at that point I had zero reason to think it was anything but perhaps an emergency, I picked it up, and there in her phone was a very long and extensive conversation with another man, about her going back to the city and meeting up with him. It broke me. I mean it shattered everything. My world, the one that seemed like I would never have, and had stumbled across completely by accident, was falling to pieces before my very eyes as I scrolled through intimate messages and promises of the future, including pictures I never wanted to see and comments that I never expected her to say to someone else. I sat there, in that moment of quiet, with the birds chirping and the world waking up as the sun peeked above the horizon with a cup of coffee in my hand, her phone laying there open, and fought back tears. She walked out and looked at her phone and at me and I asked her whats all this? She didn't have an answer. I think that's probably worse. You want a reason right? You want to be told 'well you were failing in this aspect', or 'It just faded' or 'I don't feel anything for you anymore'. But it was simply nothing. For the first time in ten years I stood up, and walked away. I don't even know what I was feeling or what I was thinking. I just stepped onto the road and walked away. (I know this getting long and I apologize, I'm skipping a lot.) We tried to fix it. I mean we tried so hard. Even with a broken heart I spent the next two years sending her endless long messages telling her how much I loved her, how much she meant to me. How she was my best friends, the love of my life, and the mother of my children (in that ten years we had had two of additional little ones that were biologically mine, even though they are all mine and call me dad, which I'm proud that they do and have never asked them to do so.) She went back to drugs, and then she started seeing other people. Even so I continued trying to show her I loved her. Even though every single time she was with someone else it broke more and more of me. Even though time after time I would just tell her 'hey come home'. Now in the midst of all this, she had lost the kids and got with a dealer, who openly hit my children and her. So they were taken and given to me. The homeless kid and mentally broken vet. It was me or foster care, and let me tell you they were not being split up and they were not being taken to someone else. So I got a place, I got the kids, and I started to try and heal so much of what they had been through, and also myself. In the meantime she had continued down her path of drugs, parties, random hookups and coming and going in my life and the kids lives (usually stopping by for money, or a safe place, and even at times to heal up from being beaten). At one point she had been beaten so badly by her boyfriend I was carrying her to the bath and bathing her and bandaging her up, and just begging her to please just stay home. The next day she was gone again. Given enough time everyone knows hard drugs leads to two places, and really only those two places, unless by some miracle they decide to get clean. Those two places are dead and prison. I kept waiting to be told she was dead. I was terrified to answer strange numbers and kept waiting on the news. Well she didn't end up dead, but she did end up in prison. She was caught with over 50 grams of fentanyl after cleaning out our bank account. Her name was still on it and I didn't realize it at the time, add to that she was my wife so had access as far as the bank was concerned. At that point I cut contact. She was still with the dealer even in jail and then prison, and still acting like this person I just didn't know at all. I started living and acting as if it was just me and the kids. We moved back to the small town, back to the old house, and tried to fix everything that had fallen completely to pieces. I didn't date. I didn't even try to. Zero desire to pursue that with all the kids, and the house, and figuring out all of that. Plus being completely honest I was shattered into pieces, and had no idea how to put them back together, and in many ways, I still don't. Well here's where the questions begin. She reached out recently. Her and her so called boyfriend had broken up, although I did receive a death threat from him saying he would come and harm me and the kids if they didn't get back together, and you know, I'm kind of hoping he's dumb enough to give that a try. That aside, here's my questions. She says she's regretful. She says she's clean. She says she wants to repair everything and have her family back. The family she destroyed. That's not a exaggeration. She literally destroyed it. It's broken but I'm working my ass off to put it back together. She's been in prison for four years. My kids have grown tall and happy and healthy, after being starved and beaten by her trash boyfriend and exposed to things no child should ever have to see. I should know, I lived that life as a child. I'm torn. As a dad I believe you won't find a single person on this planet that would ever say 'I don't want a mom or dad.' That's simply not true. But can she be that person? Can I trust her to be that person? Do I take that risk? Do I risk my children to the possibility that she could decide to try and then decide to give up? Or is it all simply lies because she's looking for a way back into our lives to just destroy them all again? As an addict in recovery I have forgiveness for anyone that has that struggle, and hope they'll win that battle. But in this situation? I'm so far beyond lost as to the right move to make and the angry hurt part of me says to tell her to get a running start and go right to hell. The man that still deep down loves her with all of me begs me to choose to give her a chance. My kids? They hold out hope she'll be better, but for the most part they worry she'll do it all over again. So ultimately aitah because while I love her, and would give so much to have the life we once had, I just don't believe it'll happen after all she's done.

Thanks for reading this! I cut a lot out because there's no real need to go into detail about many things that happened but I'll happily answer any and all questions. Please forgive me if it's not quick responses, because as stated I'm a single dad raising a pack of wild animals some days. ",1,1770828846.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

The girls giggled. The atmosphere was light-hearted, scented with cheap student wine and snacks, but there was an undertow of dead seriousness. The girls stared intently at Lily, as they waited for the details of her new guy, Paul. She had been on a couple of dates with him, and last night she had slept over at his place. 

Lily shrugged, and sucked her wine. “You guys! It was good, fine. I like him. We’re gonna hang out tomorrow night.” 

The girls gave little shrieks, of approval or disapproval, hard to tell. “Has he texted you since?”

Lily rolled her eyes. “Yes of course! we had breakfast together- he got me coffee- “ 

The girls shrieked softly again- “Ooooh Mr. Generous!” “Morning-after coffee- might as well put a ring on it!” and collapsed into more wine-fuelled giggles. 

Lily felt she needed to offer more. “He wears a scapular- all the time- in bed too!”

There was a moment of silence. Then Tessie asked “What the fuck is a scapular?” But something in the way she asked felt like she knew already. 

Lily answered, nevertheless. “He says it’s a bit of a dead monk shirt- it’s like a piece of rough brown fabric, in a necklace, around his neck. It’s itchy.”

“What a creep-zoid!” exclaimed Sophie. She had got into the habit of adding “zoid” to the end of everything at some point in high school- and never shook it off.

“So the cloth was in your face- all while you were doing it?” asked Bethanne. She was the pervy one. 

Lily shook her head. “No- don’t be ridiculous!”

The girls waited.

“Ok, he took it off and hung it round this crappy old painting of a woman in a veil, by his bed.”

“Ewwwww- Lily- was it his mom?”

“No! What is wrong with you all! Like some historic figure, a saint or something, I think.” 

Bethanne crushed some potato chips loudly, while the rest swiped their phones, their interest in Lily’s sex-life with her new guy already waning.  

Only Tessie seemed still pre-occupied. She dug in her backpack, lying by her feet, and pulled out a small ziploc plastic bag, with herbs inside. Lily thought she was offering her weed. 

Tessie snapped “No Lily, not that. It’s sage and sweetgrass.”

Lily looked blankly at her friend. 

Tessie pushed her face, damp and earnest, close to Lily. “Look. I’m not telling you to not see him, because obviously you are, and it’s not up to me. And there are some good ones, not going to lie. But you have to be careful with those people. Burn some of this next time you're with him - it’s good stuff - sage and sweetgrass purifies, you know. Good vibes.”

“Oh Tessie! Are you back at the occult-y stuff? It’s all those medieval hist courses you’ve been taking!” 

Tessie had gone through a Wiccan phase at high school- but  Lily thought she had outgrown since they had started college. She took the bag of green, and dropped it on her backpack. 

\*\*\*

Back with Paul, lying naked in his narrow student bed waiting while he took a shower, she looked thoughtfully at the framed scrap of brown fabric he had hung up by the picture. It looked innocuous enough. She touched it, disliking the roughness. The woman in the picture looked at her with big sad blue eyes. 

Paul was taking his time in the shower. Bored, she got up, pulled out Tessie’s bag, emptied the contents in an incense-burner, setting it alight. She wafted the sweet smoke towards the scapular. 

The flames leapt higher, and engulfed the scapula. Lily gasped as the scapular for a split second flashed, a tiny scrap of burning light, only to then die into thick, stinking smoke. 

She coughed, and at the same time, heard a heavy thump from the bathroom. She froze. The woman from the painting, unharmed, watched her curiously, sadly. The smoke from the now-burnt scapular hung heavily in the small room. She could still hear the shower going. 

“Paul?”

Dread filling her, she walked to the bathroom, and pushed the door open. 

Paul was lying lifeless on the wet floor, the shower still splashing on his body.

by Preston Dennett

The little people are here! And they have been here for a very long time. What do these reports have to say about modern day extraterrestrial visitations? One of the strangest enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have been reporting a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was just ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, he was inside the cottage when he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man. The man stepped back, tilted his head and ran off into the woods, turning around once to take a last look at Ron.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. The elf shared all kinds of spiritual wisdom with Galen. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents, which puzzled his parents. Instead, he wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush. The witness went to find the little elf-like figure, but it was gone.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989 when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. Her dog noticed him too. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree, and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car. Harmut’s girlfriend saw the elf too.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless, but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

""You don't. You step into conversations and discover it.""

This is the paradox of career transitions: You can't see the full range of options until you start exploring.

When this executive started their last job search, they were looking for COO roles. Then one conversation changed everything: ""Why are you doing that? Go for CEO.""

Now he’s exploring new options again.

The answer won't come from analysis. It'll come from conversations.

Each discussion:

* Reveals what you actually want (not what you think you should want)
* Exposes opportunities you couldn't have anticipated
* Refines your criteria
* Builds the network that leads to your next role

You don't need to have it all figured out before you start.

You figure it out by actually starting.

Book the coffee meetings. Take the calls. Have the conversations.

The clarity comes from interesting conversations, not Google searching.

Here’s What Actually Helps,"I enjoy working remotely, especially with the flexibility, no commute, and more control over my day. But something I did not expect was how subtly isolating it can feel over time.

It is not dramatic loneliness. It is the slow absence of small human moments. No spontaneous chats. No quick debrief after a meeting. No casual energy from just being around other people. You can be on calls all day and still feel strangely disconnected.

I was reading about workplace loneliness, and one point stood out: it is not about being physically alone, it is about lacking meaningful connection. Even people in busy offices report feeling lonely if they do not relate to their colleagues. For remote and hybrid workers, that feeling can be amplified. Some even describe feeling overlooked or invisible compared to in office staff.

What seems to help is not complicated, but it does require intention. Short virtual coffee calls that are not about work. Casual chat threads where conversation is not task-focused. Coordinating office days properly if you are hybrid, so you are actually there together, not just rotating randomly.

It also helps to build connections outside of work. If your job is no longer your main source of social interaction, you need to replace that somewhere else.

Most importantly, check in with yourself. If you are feeling flat, unmotivated, or unusually drained, it might not just be workload. It might be isolation.

Remote work gives us more freedom, but connection no longer happens by default. You have to make an effort to build on it. How has remote work been for you guys? If you have any other methods to deal with the less social aspect, let me know below. ",2,1770828312.0,RemoteJobs,0,1.0,False

by Preston Dennett

The little people are here! And they have been here for a very long time. What do these reports have to say about modern day extraterrestrial visitations? One of the strangest enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have been reporting a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was just ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, he was inside the cottage when he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man. The man stepped back, tilted his head and ran off into the woods, turning around once to take a last look at Ron.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. The elf shared all kinds of spiritual wisdom with Galen. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents, which puzzled his parents. Instead, he wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush. The witness went to find the little elf-like figure, but it was gone.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989 when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. Her dog noticed him too. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree, and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car. Harmut’s girlfriend saw the elf too.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless, but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

1r22b62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1r22b62/cant_help_a_stubborn_cafe_owner_whos_business_is/,Can't help a stubborn cafe owner who's business is failing.,"Edit: \*Whose. Pretty much noticed the typo the moment I posted.

\----------------

I passed by an interesting, U.F.O themed cafe a few months ago and decided to walk in. The aesthetic was a disaster, but it otherwise felt like a dream come true; two beautiful dogs greeted me as soon as I walked in, spacious, a big TV with a PS5, and comfortable seats, all empty. The owner was very friendly and talkative and we hit it off. The coffee was excellent and the prices modest.

It bothered me that he kept asking if I wanted anything else the moment I finished drinking anything, and he kept offering me food even though he knew I'd just eaten and I'm not hungry. He was like my grandmother, but if she was interested in my money rather than my well-being. It was odd. I spend more in small business cafes. Definitely enough. The amount of money he expected from me was unreasonable.

The events are great. There's nothing else like it here. Cafes and bars aren't usually aimed at nerds like me. We had video game nights, board game nights, and you could pretty much go there during the day and pass the time any way you wanted. If a new music album came out and I really liked it, I could just go there and he could play it and we'd enjoy it together.

Thing is, he's obnoxious. He talks *a lot.* It often doesn't bother me even if he doesn't give me a chance to speak, like when he talks about music or whatever, but it can be tmi sometimes and when he yaps and it's tmi I find it harder to tolerate. Since day 1, I've been the guy's therapist, and the way he explains his problems is a bit winy. He's neurotic, and it's often him complaining about his eff ups that he never learns from. His girlfriend is about to leave him for going out and having (too) crazy weekends every week. They have a mortgage together and she's even paying most of the rent of the cafe from the money she's making from her full-time job. He just sulks all day in the cafe because he gets no customers. His girlfriend is an angel and she's even coming straight to the cafe to help right after work even though he could easily manage by himself.

Every time I go there and he tells me he's had yet another crazy weekend, I feel like punching him in the face. Like what are you doing man? Your girlfriend is doing all that for you and you're gonna blow it with her because you can't have a decent weekend like normal people? I want him to just not tell me about this any longer. I never asked him to.

I tried giving him feedback about the aesthetic of the place because it's very inconsistent. He kept the furniture of the previous cafe which is dark, serious, and modern, and then just put some playful alien stuff on it. The colour palette is a mess and even the alien stuff is inconsistent, as in, you have horror alien stuff, childish alien soft-toys, an actual vintage alien spaceship looking toy, and disco balls shaped like spaceships. A lot of the alien themed stuff on the walls is in black and white and it's mosaic style? Very bad taste. Then there's the dark colours of the furniture that was there from before, and the alien stuff comes in a variety of different colours. Some shiny, some not so shiny, some of it old and faded. It's like he went knocking door-to-door asking people to donate anything alien-related and accepted just about anything people gave him. The walls are mainly olive-green and black, by the way. I just remembered that. *Ugh*. I gave him feedback and he immediately rejected it and wasn't having any of it.

I told him he should market the place more because there's nothing online. I would never have known about the place if it wasn't on the way to the shop I buy cat food from. Also, terrible area for a cafe. Not enough foot traffic, but he says rent is relatively cheap which is fair enough... that said, all the more reason to market online. You need to make up for the lack of foot traffic somehow. He replied that he doesn't like influencers. I said that I didn't even mention influencers but by that point he looked completely disinterested and closed off. Later that evening, I asked him if he'd consider asking some professional in the cafe or marketing business for pointers and he said he'd consider it but looked uninterested.

I'm aware that he talks a lot and know what I'm getting into when I'm going there, but I also noticed that he talks to customers that also appear to be uninterested in talking. I noticed it a few times, but I was already aware that he's stubborn and doesn't take constructive criticism well, so I didn't say anything. At one point, a customer left and the owner laughed and told me that the person probably left because the owner talked his ears off. Then he said that, well, that's how he (the owner) is, and he's not for everyone. Dude, you need customers. Stop bothering the customers.

Such a stubborn individual. He's ruining his relationship and his business and is just so stubborn about it. I never met anyone who's just doing everything wrong and it's taking a huge toll on his life yet he's completely closed to the idea of improving anything.",1,1770828062.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1r221r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r221r6/ice_and_bone_part_2/,"Ice and Bone, Part 2","The sky turned from grey to black, and not even the moon broke through the cloud cover. Christine sat with her thighs to her chest and her arms wrapped around her legs. Her chin ached where it pressed into her knees, but the constant chill biting through the jackets kept her frozen in place. 

Two of them were hers. A lighter jumper and a heavier coat meant for chilled days, not long snow-filled nights in the open. The third jacket didn’t belong to her. She didn’t know whose it was, and she didn’t ask when Nadya handed it to her. She simply put it on and ignored the dark stain by the zipper. If she didn’t think about it, maybe it would stop being blood. 

She couldn’t stop thinking about it. 

The others were silent behind her, but she doubted they slept. The chimera never truly left after its last attack. It circled somewhere behind the cloud cover, crying and shrieking. Its torn voice was difficult to pinpoint, but they never saw it. 

The sensor lay near her feet, mouth still open but its tongues were still. Occasionally one would quiver, and Christine would smell ozone on the wind, but nothing else. The soul pit closed about an hour ago, but her eyes were still drawn to where it was as if waiting for it to open back up and swallow the entire train whole. 

Cal was alive and in good spirits, all things considered. He was buried beneath piles of blankets until only his pale face peaked out. His lips were blue, but he managed to crack a smile. He was likely the only one of them that would get any sleep, and that was only kind of a blessing. 

Christine knew how stem rushes worked in theory, but nothing could prepare her for the grizzly melding of flesh, fabric, and bone. The wound was sealed instantly, but it took the ragged remnants of Cal’s boot and pants with it. The skin around the stump was tinted a disgusting green where it was layered with cargo fabric, and splotches of bright red contrasted the stark white of the swollen mass of flesh. 

Christine only got a glimpse before it was swiftly wrapped in a jacket and Cal was moved, but she still saw it every time she closed her eyes. 

So she kept her eyes open and didn’t think about the not-blood on the zipper of the jacket that wasn’t hers. 

Someone stirred, but she didn’t turn until they sat beside her. Max wasn’t a particularly tall man, but he was broad. He had a kind face that was only just beginning to line, but the exhaustion under his eyes aged him. He wiped his nose on his sleeve and settled next to her with a grunt. 

“Can’t sleep?” he asked, voice low. 

“Can you?” Christine replied. 

“Mm.”

They both stared out beyond the wreckage of the train. New Detroit was only a few miles away. Walkable if the landscape wasn’t drowned in snow and patrolled by a chimera. No one dared step out to cover the remaining half of Esther’s body. It was another thing Christine didn’t think about. 

“Have you ever been to New Detroit?” Max asked after a beat of silence. 

Christine nodded, “My parents live there, but I haven’t been back in…years.” 

“Why come back?”

“Work. Kind of. After the Society dissolved in Chicago, I figured I might as well go somewhere familiar. Somewhere I have a couch to crash on for a few weeks.” 

“Detroit’s my home base too. Born and raised and even brought my wife back.”

The light was low, but when he moved, Christine could see the small smile on his lips. 

“What’s her name?” she asked, eager for the promise of mundane conversation.  

“Melissa. Most people call her Lisey though. We met a few years back at a coffee shop,” he chuckled. “It was like a movie. She was there with her daughter, and there were no seats left. I was there doing…I don’t even remember what I was doing. But we got to talking, and the rest is history…sometimes I hate this job for taking me away from her. I think this might be my last trip.” 

“I don’t blame you. I’ve spent my entire adult life studying anomalies, but I don’t think I like being this close to them.”

Max chuckled, “Not the fieldwork type?” 

“I have asthma,” Christine cracked a smile. “And flat feet.” 

Max shifted back onto his elbows, and Christine rested her chin on her knees. 

“Do you think anyone is coming for us?” she asked. 

Max sighed, “I don’t know. Probably. Eventually. The question is, will we still be here when they do?” 

Christine pressed her lips into a thin line. She had no idea what sort of defenses New Detroit had, much less what could be mobilized. A chimera like that required serious fire power, and Christine wasn’t confident the board would authorize a zeppelin or anti-air artillery for a single, small cargo train. 

“How far from the bastion are we?” 

“Around 70 miles. 45 more minutes and we would’ve been there.” 

Christine huffed a puff of air and watched the white cloud dissipate, “So close. We could make a run for it. Get there in a day.” 

“Or get ripped in half and carried off to God-knows-where by a fucked up bird thing. I’m with the ranger. We have a better chance of sitting tight.”

“Mm.” 

The conversation petered out, and any hope of levity disappeared with it. Eventually Christine closed her eyes, and when she opened them, it was gray again. There was still no sky behind the wall of clouds, but somehow the night had passed and morning came. 

Christine’s stomach growled, but she didn’t stir from her spot. There was movement behind her, and Max startled awake at her side. 

Nadya knelt with two granola bars extended. 

“Good morning,” she said. 

Max scoffed as he took a granola bar, “Fucking lovely, ain’t it?”

Christine looked at the bar. It was rhubarb flavored. She didn’t know what rhubarb was. She looked back at Nadya.

“How long do you think the food will last?”

“Two days,” Nadya said. “We won’t be feasting with full bellies, but it’ll be enough to keep us warm and awake. 

“Provided something else doesn’t unawake us first,” Max grumbled through a bite of granola. 

Nadya gestured to the sensor, “Any word from our friend?” 

Christine shook her head, “Just what we’ve heard ourselves.” 

“Shit. Does it have nothing better to do than circle us?” 

“Not really,” Christine replied. “It…we have no way of knowing what it’s doing when it doesn’t know itself. It’s probably only here because it’s familiar terrain.”

“I wish it would die already,” Max grumbled. 

“Wishing won’t get us anywhere,” Nadya said as she stood. “Focus on staying warm and keep an eye out for the chimera and for rescue. Hopefully the wreckage stands out enough against the snow, but if the weather turns, we might have to find a way to signal a rescue ourselves.” 

Christine lifted her head, alarmed, “What do you mean?”

“If it snows too much, the wreckage will get covered, and we’ll just look like another mound of snow. We can probably make some sort of banner, though. There’s enough brightly covered fabric, and we could spread it out…” 

“I saw a red dress yesterday,” Christine said. “We could probably tie that to something and get the wind to catch.” 

“There’re lantern bugs in the engine room,” Max interrupted. 

Nadya’s attention snapped to him, “What?” 

“Lantern bugs. They act as emergency lights. If they survived the crash, we might be able to get them bright enough to signal. ‘Course we’ll also be signaling the beastie.” 

Nadya’s jaw stiffened, “And you didn’t mention this before because….?”

Max rolled his eyes, “I was busy with the dead bodies and imminent danger. Besides, they’re not really useful otherwise. They don’t provide any heat, they’re toxic as hell, and like I said, they’re also great for signalling the beastie. As far as I’m concerned, they’re better off buried until we’re sure some really big guns are here.”

“That’s a good point,” Christine said, grimacing. “Trying to get them even now would be risky. We know the chimera doesn’t respond well to movement. I doubt bright lights will make it happy.” 

Nadya looked out into the snow scape, her brow pinched and eyes squinted. A stray snowflake caught in her eyelashes, and she blinked it away. 

“Let’s hope they’re easy enough to get to if the time comes,” she said. “I don’t trust this weather.”

And for good reason.  
An hour later, Christine watched with sinking dread as snowflakes steadily covered more and more of the train. The cold was bitter, it bit into her cheeks and stung her nose raw. She tied one of her old shirts around her face, but it did little except reflect her own bad breath back at her. They tied the red dress to some jagged metal along with a few other articles of brightly colored clothing and kept it tucked at the back of the train car.

The wind whistled past them, and Christine gathered the leftover jackets and blankets. Nadya and Trevor moved Cal slowly behind cover, his low curses interrupting the blistering storm. Christine scurried after them, quickly moving to cover him back up. He shivered violently, his face deathly pale and blue lips pulled taut in a grimace. He looked somewhere just past her with glassy eyes, and Christine tucked the coat around his neck, pulling up the hood to cover the lower half of his face. 

His entire body froze, and his eyes widened, “Look.”

Christine spun around in search of the chimera, but there was no blundering form or distant screech. No, all she saw was a small mass hanging beneath the clouds, lights flickering along its body. 

A zeppelin. 

She could have cried. 

“They’re here,” she gasped. “It’s a zeppelin!” 

“Get the banner,” Nadya snapped. “Quickly!”

Christine leaped to her feet, scrambling for the red dress, but even as brightly colored as it was, it still looked gray in the dull morning light. Christine prayed it was enough as she helped Nadya tie it off to the wreckage. She grabbed at a sleeve, waving it around as if that could signal the zeppelin. There was no response from the mass as it drifted over them. Spotlights swept over the snow, barely breaking through the gray sky but swiping over them all the same. For a moment Christine was blinded by stark white before it was snatched away, and she stared up with wide eyes. They had to see them. They had to.   
“Did they see us?” 

“Get the lanterns!”

Christine didn’t know if they were talking to her, but her legs moved nonetheless, and she leaped out of the train car. The snow grabbed at her legs, pulling her down to mid calf. She quickly freed them and stomped through the snow towards the lump that was the engine room. Spotlights swept the ground a short distance away, but she turned her back to them. The snow bit her knees as she fell before the mound and shoveled snow from where she thought the entrance was. More hands joined hers, and Max grabbed a steel rod, moving it out of the way. It was dark inside, and Christine prayed the lanterns were intact. She crawled into the gaping maw and felt around for the lanterns. Everything was sideways, but she found the remnants of the console. It was twisted and pockmarked with holes, but on the ground before it were the two lanterns. They were dark, and one of them was busted. Grey ooze seeped out, but the other looked intact. She felt her breath catch as she snatched it up. It was a large cylinder, and it was slick with ice. She lugged it after her, dragging it back out of the engine room. 

“Oh thank God,” Max wheezed as he grappled with it and helped her pull it into the snow. 

“Please work,” Christine whispered. 

Max flicked the switch, and the thick bodies inside the cylinder twitched with a dim green light. Then went out. Max tried again.

“C’mon,” Christine breathed. “Please, please, ple-”

Christine smelled ozone, and she whipped around to see the dark shadow cast the train and piling snow into a black void. 

The shriek was delayed, and Christine swore she blacked out for a moment. Someone yelled something, and there was a flurry of movement that meant nothing to her. The shadow seemed to watch her with predatory eyes, and she didn’t dare move as it danced across the snow just outside the train’s gaping maw. 

Then snow exploded as the grotesque mass landed hard before them, fleshy wings batting at the wind as limbs flailed. Christine felt more than heard the muffled boom as it filled the train. It was a sharp contrast to the screech the chimera loosed as it flailed backwards. Light filled the train again, and Trevor half kneeled, his body twisted around with the artillery swallowing his arm to the elbow. It pulsed with a pale, salmon colored light, and the muzzle sphincter slowly shrank closed to prepare for the next shot. He yelled something, but it fell on deaf ears. 

The chimera clambered back into a righted position, and the stench of ozone scorched Christine’s nose. One of the beast’s scattered eyes rolled towards her. It stared through her, the white nearly crimson from busted blood vessels and the iris swimming with an inky fear. It rolled away, and Christine wondered if it saw her. If it saw anything at all.

She ripped her gaze away and whipped her head around in search of something she could do. Anything but sit there uselessly. 

“Push it back!” Nadya yelled. 

She stood with a wide stance, Cal’s crossbow braced against her shoulder, and the sights spread out before it. It was silent and barely moved as it launched a flurry of arrows into the chimera. The chimera screamed, and Christine felt it echo in her bones. It dropped into her stomach like a lead ball, and she swallowed the bile it displaced. 

“Move!” she yelled to no one in particular.

Her fingers slipped over Max’s hand, and she sprinted back towards the train, towards cover. The chimera’s wings beat a storm into the wind, and snow and ice pummeled her as she slipped and stumbled through the slushy mud. She grappled for the edge of the train car, the jagged metal pressing through the soaked wool socks on her hands. Christine hauled herself up and dove inside, hitting the floor hard.

Another muffled boom, and the chimera leaped back with a bitter hiss. It threw a wave of snow into the train, and Christine’s face stung as the ice bit into her skin. She ducked for cover behind the remnants of one of the seats. She grappled for a handhold and for an idea, anything she could grasp. Her heart felt frozen in her chest, and no amount of breath could warm it. It hurt, but she ignored it as her gaze fell on Cal. He was awake, his eyes wide.

Christine locked onto him, grabbing his arm and yanking him behind the seat. He cried out in surprise but quickly snapped his mouth shut, using his other hand to drag himself after her. He wheezed into her ear, his fingers curling in a death grip around her wrist as another screech shook the train. 

“Where’s Max?” he yelled over the muffled boom. 

Christine whipped her head around, but she couldn’t see him. She shook her head, and Cal tried to sit up. 

“Shit, there’s no way that zeppelin can get to us with that bastard in the way!” 

Christine craned her neck, trying to see the zeppelin. It still hovered beneath the clouds, but the spotlights were gone, making it little more than a ghost in the haze. Her heart sank. If the chimera caught sight of it, if it turned its attention, would the zeppelin flee? Or worse, would it be shredded by those ghastly claws? 

Christine didn’t know what kind of fire power a ship like that carried, and it didn’t seem inclined to show its hand. It simply watched as the chimera flailed and screamed between muffled booms. They needed the chimera gone. Or distracted. 

Bright green light lit the chimera in an eerie halo. It flicked off. Then on. Three short bursts, three longer ones, another three short ones. 

Christine caught sight of Max, still crouched out in the snow, the lantern propped up against him. 

Christine met his gaze and held it. Three short bursts. 

“You idiot!” Cal spat. “You’re gonna bring it right to you!”

Three longer bursts.  

If Max heard, he didn’t react. He continued flicking the lantern on and off as he stood on shaky legs. Another muffled boom, and a flurry of snow as the chimera stumbled back. Flashes of green light illuminated its black skin stretched taut over bubbling flesh, and itwhipped around, gaze set on Max. 

“Run!” 

Christine’s throat burned raw, and Max did exactly that. 

But he took the lantern with him. 

“Max!” 

“What the hell does he think he’s doing?”

Christine watched as the green light disappeared behind the hulking shadow of the chimera as it tore through the snow. Three long bursts. 

She felt faint, the world was muffled. She couldn’t tell the difference between an inhale and an exhale, but she felt the warm sting of a tear dangling from her lashes. She blinked and it fell onto her cheek. 

A hand grabbed her upper arm and hauled her to her feet. Nadya’s face was dark red, her eyes wide and wild. Her once perfectly sculpted hair was tangled in frizzed strands around her face.

“Go!” she spat, shoving Christine towards the train’s opening. 

Just beyond she spotted the shadow of the zeppelin creeping forward. Long tendrils unfurled from beneath it, dropping into the snow and then dragging along it. Christine vaguely registered them as ladders. 

She still couldn’t breath, but she let Nadya haul her towards the zeppelin. Her feet felt numb and clumsy as she stumbled. Trevor wasn’t far away, and he gestured to the zeppelin with his free hand. 

“It’s clear! Go!” 

“Max!” she wheezed. 

“I’m *trying*,” he replied, voice raw and desperate.

The wind whipped her face, the chimera screamed, the green light flashed in quick succession. Christine turned her back, watching as Nadya wrapped her arm around Cal and hauled him upwards. Christine pivoted, running back and throwing his other arm over her shoulder. She was shorter than him and Nadya both, but she hoped she at least helped with the balance. Helped with *something*. She couldn’t look away from the green light even as she dragged Cal after her and Nadya. 

The ladders dangled like tentacles from beneath the zeppelin. It was nearly silent, hovering above them like an indifferent specter. 

A muffled boom. 

Cal grabbed onto the ladder, twisting the rope around his arm and hooking his foot on one of the steps. He braced, and the ladder swung as it slowly lifted up.

“Grab on,” Nadya said, pushing a ladder towards her. 

Christine looked back towards the green light. It remained on. 

“Go!” Nadya screamed, pushing her into the rope. 

Christine stumbled, her body snapping obediently. She mimicked the way Cal wrapped his arm in the rope, and her stomach lurched as the rope jerked upwards, lifting her feet from the snow. She flailed, trying to find a foothold. 

“Trevor, come on!” Nadya screamed from below. 

If Trevor replied, Christine couldn’t hear it over one more muffled boom. 

Then the only sound was the roaring snow and the distant cry of the chimera. 

Christine squeezed her eyes shut and dug her fingers into the rope until her nails bent inside of the wool socks. She was sure she would vomit if she hadn’t left her stomach in the snow. 

She almost didn’t notice the burst of hot air that encased her as she fell bodily onto a hard floor. 

“It’s alright,” a voice said through the fuzz. “You’re okay. You’re safe now.” 

Christine realized the fuzz was her own strained breathing. She tried to inhale, but it stuck in her chest, and she choked and wheezed. Her ribs ached, her lungs screamed, her head spun. 

Someone draped a thick blanket around her shoulders. Someone else pulled her deeper inside the zeppelin. In the background of her consciousness, people argued. 

Something cold pressed against her face, and air rushed against her lips. It tasted bitter and familiar, and when she inhaled, it tunneled through the blockage in her chest and broke into her lungs. She gasped around a lungful of air, choking on her own spit as her body fought for oxygen. 

“Anomalous signature 1500 meters away and retreating,” a man announced. 

“All survivors accounted for,” said another. 

“Max,” Christine wheezed through the mask pressed to her face. 

The room spun around her, and she tried to raise her voice, but all that came out was a strained wheeze. She shrank back against the wall and closed her eyes. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

After they pricked her finger and confirmed her bio passport, a tall ranger led her to the hull of the zeppelin. The belly. It was a pale orange color with spidering veins pumping fuel through them. A thin, soft mesh coated the flesh, and she trailed her fingers along it as she made her way to a window. The zeppelin’s skin was pinched and bluish where it fused to the glass, and there was a chill to the air around it. Christine wrapped her blanket tighter around herself and watched the snow pass below. Slowly, forms appeared and the lumps went from smooth hills to jagged lines of buildings. Flat roofs of long abandoned buildings watched her, and once filled streets wound through her vision. 

Behind her, Nadya spoke to one of the officers. In her reflection, she was stiff with straight shoulders and head raised, but her voice trembled ever so slightly. 

Trevor was nearby as a doctor crouched over Cal, but he caught her eye in the window and stood. 

Mud streaked across his face, and he wiped his nose with his sleeve. 

“You good?” he asked. 

“No,” she replied, looking back out the window.

Below lights became more frequent and she spotted signs of life. 

A car trundling down the snow covered road, its headlights pinpoints of light behind the plow. A squat building with warm lights spilling out and a jagged apparatus on the roof with a red blinking light. And beyond that, the great wall of New Detroit. White keratin spires connected by thousands of steely threads, intertwined into an impenetrable wall. 

“We did everything we could,” Trevor continued, and Christine squeezed her eyes shut.

Trevor kept talking, “He saved us. Sacrificed himself to-”

“Stop,” Christine snapped. “I don’t want to hear it.” 

Trevor grimaced. His hand awkwardly hovered over Christine’s shoulder before finally dropping onto it. His hand was heavy, grounding. It was more comfort than any words could be. 

She opened her eyes as they passed over the wall and into the New Detroit Bastion. The city was alive and pulsing with blue and green lights. An ad for a new gut-focused symbiote pet caught her eye. The small creature displayed was pale with cartoonishly large eyes and a massive grin that welcomed her home.

My daughter is a full-time college student and also works a part-time job. She still lives in our home. Lately I’ve been wondering whether it’s reasonable to charge her rent (or some kind of monthly contribution), or if I should just let her keep saving while she’s in school.

A few details for context:

	•	She feeds herself. She buys most of her own food, but she also spends a good amount on outside meals and coffees (like takeout, café drinks, etc.).

	•	Her schedule is kind of split: she’s here about 4 days a week, and she spends 3 days (usually the weekend) at her partner’s house.

	•	She does buy herself things occasionally, but not constantly—mostly skincare and sometimes a top or bottoms here and there.

	•	She’s generally responsible and not partying or anything like that, but I also want her to learn budgeting and the real cost of living.

I’m torn because:

	•	Part of me thinks: if she’s working and living at home, even part-time, it’s fair to contribute something—utilities, groceries, “adult responsibility,” etc.

	•	The other part of me thinks: she’s in school full-time and trying to build her future, and I don’t want to make things harder if she’s already stretched thin.

So my questions are:

	1.	Is it reasonable to charge rent in this situation?

	2.	If yes, would you do a small flat rent, or more of a “contribute to household expenses” setup (utilities/groceries)?

	3.	If you charged rent, did you keep it, or save it and give it back later (like when they move out)?

I’d really appreciate advice from parents and also from people who were the “kid” in this situation. I want to set her up for success, not create resentment.",1,1770827402.0,Parenting,8,1.0,False

I don't usually talk or post about relationships or affection because neither has ever stayed with me for long. I've always had the knack of feeling a bit too much about people who I think would stay, only for them to leave.

Furthermore, I saw her post in either this subreddit or another, saying she needed people to talk to. Out of curiosity, I sent her a text asking how she was. After 13 days, she texted me back, I had completely forgotten about it by then.

After that, we started talking and found out she's living in Delhi for work but is actually from the same place as me and we were of same age. I think that's what made us interested in each other. We talked constantly. The next day (Saturday), I had an office tour, and I didn't stop texting her for even a minute because I didn't want to keep her waiting. We talked about a lot of things, our food preferences, our vices, even our wishes. I sent her pictures of flowers and random things I captured that day, and she was intrigued to talk more.

The next day, I went to the Book Fair all alone. My friends had a last-minute change of plans, which I even mentioned to her, but we still talked. It went on like this until the second Monday, when I had a bad headache and sinus pain. As much as I wanted to text her that night, I couldn't. I couldn't even look at a screen. Still, I managed to text her goodnight before going to sleep. The next day I texted her, but she didn't reply. I wondered if she was busy with work. Two days later, I texted her again to see if she was okay, and then suddenly she deleted her account.

I won't say I was catching feelings for her, or maybe I'm lying if I say I wasn't, but I accidentally found someone with whom I felt that spark again. Honestly, after a long time, I felt completely invested in someone.

The weather is getting nicer outside and flu and covid cases are decreasing.  I would like to be able to take baby to the grocery store sometimes or church forbthe first time or the coffee shop. I am also concerned that if we do start getting cases of measles in our town, that will make even taking the baby to the pediatrician for normal checkups a risk. Has anyone gotten the measles vaccine early for your LO? Were there any side effects and did everything go all right? Did the pediatrician give you a hard time to allow you to get your LO the vaccine early?

Also, did anyone give your LO the flu and Covid vaccines at six months? How did that work out? Did baby tolerate them ?  
now that my babies wake windows are getting longer, I am excited about getting to take him places. But not if that means potentially exposing him to measles and a severe case of the flu.

1r21wyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1r21wyr/tired_of_being_wipped_back_and_fourth/,Tired of being wipped back and fourth.,"So il be blunt, my living situation is bad, ive been trapped in the shelter system (non consecutively) for 6yrs come this April, the problem i keep running into that leads to me having to move so often is the shelters dont give us long enough to be able to find work, build savings, build first and last then get out. But in the last 6yrs alone, ive lived in 9 diffrent cities/townships, from as big as 3 million people all the way down to as small as less than 3,000 people. 

I grew up in the cities, never really liked it, the convinces are nice and all, but id rather have peace and quiet, know my neighbors and be surrounded by nature not concrete and brick. So when i moved to a big city for 4 months, i hated every second of it, then immediately after that, i moved to a small town and managed to stay for almost 3yrs. 

I really wanted to make that town my permanent home, i actually loved living there, if i wanted to wander the streets at 3am alone, i could and the only thing i had to worry about was bears and cyotes. Even though everyone knew i was technically homeless, everyone (outside the shelter) made me feel welcome, looked past my living situation and saw me for me, it was genuinely impossible for me to even just go grab a coffee on the way to work without stopping to chat with someone. 

Now? Im back in the city living with my parents, and i still dont like it, strangers dont greet eachother when passing by, ive got no clue who the neighbors are despite actively trying to get to know them, when i go to get a coffee, im just another cog in the wheel and i get ignored. Its always busy, its loud, its polluted theres too much concrete and the drivers absolutely suck. 

Why was i forced to leave? I literally dont know, and neither does my primary worker, i was living in a shelter, working, was 1 week away, 1 paycheck from having first and last months rent so i could move out into my own place, then they booted me out with nowhere to go during not just a snow storm, but during extreme cold. Did i mention this is the 2nd time that particular shelter kicked me out immediately after finding stable full time employment? 

Like, why? Because of that i didnt really have a choice, had to quit my job and just, leave or freeze to death, Words can't describe how resentful and angry i am at the management of that shelter. But either way, it is what it is and i cant change it now, but literally all i need, a place to stay closer to that town so i can either try to get my old job back, or find a new one, and move back to that town.

 I cant keep doing this move every 4 months bs, and i cant keep living in this depressing ass city, its impossible to improve my situation if i cant stay in one place long enough to actually get stuff done. It feels like the shelter system is designed to trap you in it, bouncing from place to place constantly, never able to stay long enough to make a dent in living situations, thats not the way it should be.

I've been putting up a hard no there and he gets pissy. Last I saw him I found a woman's number in his apt and he had been texting with her about 3 weeks ago.

We met for coffee yesterday (he asked me--we had plans for Monday, but alas, he was too hung over, and asked me to come over. And again, I declined and raincheckwd for yesterday.) and immediately mentioned how much extra stress I add to his life :)

We had this long heartfelt talk in the car and he told me he just needs to focus on his mental health and getting a job (fired--second one in six months) and he just needed a friend right now. We were both crying and I agreed and was just utterly heartbroken. He kept telling me he's in love with me, I'm his best friend, he misses me, but he has no faith in us/me/himself right now and has no energy to put the effort in to make it work. 

He called me as soon as I got him. Ten minutes maybe. Said ""I just want to remind you that I love you and we will be okay and get through this together. You're still my person.""

Huh? Didn't u just break up w me????

I got in bed and cried with my cat for a couple hours and made the mistake of texting him. I just said ""this sucks"". He calls me immediately and we're both crying and he gear shifts into hot rage, saying he's been trying to end things for weeks, saying I won't let him go, saying that he doesn't wanna be with me anymore. In any chance we had I just threw out the window because of my poor behavior (?). I'm just sitting silently on the phone at this point. 

Anyway we went back and forth all night. His roommates got involved (I say roommates lightly. He lives in the finished basement and a family lives upstairs). Where they keep telling him to leave me alone, stop harassing me, he's abusive etc. calls me to tell me everyone's mad at him and it's my fault--even tho I had legit no idea what was going on in the house at this time. 

We're still on the phone back-and-forth. Him telling me he never wants to speak with me again, he would be so comfortable with just never even thinking about me for the rest of his life. And then when I say OK and hang up the phone he starts texting me. He's calling me again. He's sending me screenshots. He's telling me he loves me.

Roommates are friends of mine too. the woman I'm friends w told me he was bragging about a three some recently and it just did it for me. He won't admit it, and tbh he's such a loser I don't believe it. He said he lied to seem cool.  I am seething and disgusted. I actually have a mood disorder too and have been sober 6 yr and I really keep my shit in check. I'm empathetic to his situation but I'm absolutely disgusting and don't think there's any going back. Just three hours prior we were crying and holding each other and kissing and he turns into this person so fast. He's been unstable for over six weeks now. 

I fucking snapped last night. I called him back and I was like I know how desperately you wanna break up with me (even tho he intentionally sucks me back in and won't let me go) but that's too fucking bad. He goes. It's not fair for you to keep me in a relationship. I don't wanna be in. And I said that's like so not my fucking problem at this point, with everything you have put me through, you can fucking suffer just like I do. (I know how wrong that was but I am so sick of being screamed at, told I'm the problem, telling me he hates my dead dog bc that's when our relationship failed, I was too hard to take care of?!). He starts snifffling and I was like honestly, shut the fuck up. We're getting you a patches eval and on pills because you're a fucking menace. 

He's snuggling and goes okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow. 

Turns out his roommate actually got physical with him because he was screaming and his girlfriend (pulled the phone out of his hand to yell at her??) and I guess my SO is mad they let it ""slip"" about the threesome.

Anyway. I'm at work right now. I have acid in my throat I'm so angry. This is the first time in six weeks I haven't cried over him. I'm so, so angry. 

I am quite literally going to tell him to pack a bag and I'm dropping him off at rehab. He looks like shit. He had the shakes yesterday and was jaundice. I need to wash my hands of this shit. I am so, so fuckinf angry. 

And I'm so sad for myself, that I truly thought I would marry this man and have been planning my life with him and that is gone and it's never coming back. I genuinely think I hate him. I don't know why it's so hard for me to walk away. ",1,1770826920.0,BipolarSOs,2,1.0,False

1r21shx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1r21shx/how_are_others_affording_a_nanny/,How are others affording a nanny?,"Hi all - I went back to work after 12 weeks and our girl started in daycare on 1/12. Since then, she and I have been sick \~85% of the days (of course my husband has remained relatively unscathed). To preface, I never wanted to send her to daycare this young. I think daycare has many developmental benefits and is great for child slightly older. She is going to an in-home daycare recommended by family's in our neighborhood, but I don't feel comfortable having her so sick so often at such a young age. My husband feels strongly that we cannot afford a nanny, and therefore I ""lost"" the battle (for lack of a better word) surrounding childcare.

As background, my husband and I live in Los Angeles and make combined income of \~$520k per year. We currently own a home with a \~$9k monthly mortgage leaving us a bit cash poor. We are planning on selling the house this year and downsizing to save money. Even so, my husband feels that our finances will be too tight going from $2k per month in daycare costs to $5k - $6k in nanny costs. Most rental options in Los Angeles for our needs cost around $5k monthly.

My question is - how are others affording a nanny? I get so confused when I see my peers with a nanny and I question how they can afford it, but we can't. Do they have family to help some of the days? Do you just suck it up and make it work? Cut back on everyday expenses? I'm genuinely curious how others are making it work because I don't know how much longer I can take seeing my daughter sick constantly.

Edit: About $100k of that is my husband's bonus which he immediately puts into savings. So our combined monthly income would be $420k pre-tax. We're both relatively frugal people (don't shop often or extensively and when we do it's affordable items) but we do enjoy ordering take out on the weekends, grabbing a coffee, etc., but living in Los Angeles sadly isn't cheap

Edit Edit: I guess the take away is that we **can** afford it, but husband just doesn't see the value in putting our money toward a nanny when daycare is an option. We can't afford it in the sense that it would be an extra $4k per month that we'd otherwise save. So, has anyone else found themself in a similar situation?",2,1770826906.0,BabyBumps,9,0.75,False

1r21p7u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r21p7u,Bikers heading to the NC500 — are you missing the best Highland route to nc500?,"If you’re planning a Scotland trip this year and thinking about the NC500, This better road then boerding A9 stuck behind line of tourist, or crashes on the A9 it be closed for hours. Can delay and mess up your trip. So I seriously recommend taking the A93 through Glenshee, over the Cairnwell Pass, and down to Braemar instead of sticking to the usual flat A9. This stretch is some of the most scenic, remote, and fun riding you can get in the Highlands.

The Cairnwell Pass is the highest public road in the UK at around 670 meters. It’s wide, smooth, and full of sweeping bends with epic mountain views, basically motorcycle heaven. The road winds through remote moorland and old forests, and if you’re lucky you might even spot a golden eagle perched along the roadside. Keep in mind the weather can change fast; snow, ice, or fog can appear even in late spring or early autumn. Services and fuel are limited, so make sure to stop in bearmar. before heading up the pass.

Glenshee Ski Centre is worth a break. It’s the largest ski area in Scotland and has a café and parking for bikes. In summer you can even take the chairlift up for panoramic views of the Cairngorms. It’s the perfect spot to stretch your legs, grab a coffee, and get some epic photos.

Braemar is a classic Highland village rich in history dating back to the 11th century. If you time it right, the Braemar Highland Gathering in September is a chance to see traditional games, piping, and the caber toss. Nearby attractions include Balmoral Castle and the Royal Lochnagar Distillery if you want a detour from riding.

This route is more exciting than the A9. The twists, remoteness, and wildlife make it unforgettable. You can see red deer, ptarmigan, and birds of prey along the way, especially around dawn or dusk. The best months to ride are May through to September for the longer daylight hours and milder weather. Bring layers, waterproofs, and heated grips if you have them, and take it slow on blind corners so you can enjoy the scenery.

Automation does the boring heavy lifting now:

* keeps track of context (no more ""hey remember me?"" cringe)
* queues smart touches when the timing feels right
* flags when someone's suddenly hot (price question = 🚨)
* pauses if they're cooling off
* even drafts follow-ups and pings us if it needs real human eyes

Humans only jump in for the stuff that actually needs nuance: don't spam when they're quiet, don't let a hot one die just because we're slammed, schedule the real follow-through.

Crazy part? Fixing this moved revenue more than any cold-email glow-up we ever pulled. Pipeline started flowing faster deals weren't just sitting there, they were closing.

1r21ibm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r21ibm,"Measuring (mainly) Brita filter performance (London, UK)","This project started for a few reasons; firstly there are quite a lot of statements around the internet saying Brita filters either didn’t reduce hardness, or, if they do, that they swap sodium for calcium and so don’t affect alkalinity, that hadn’t been my experience previously (although they sell a lot of products, and those statements are true for some). I also stumbled on a now-unlisted James Hoffmann video comparing a few brands of fresh filter, which made me realise you could relatively easily measure this stuff (not just conductivity TDS).

Right now in the UK we have two main countertop Brita options, “Limescale Expert” and “Pure Performance”, and in London we have tap water that is about 320ppm CaCO3 hardness, 210ppm CaCO3 alkalinity, so you have to do something to it if you want to taste your coffee. I wanted to know not just if a fresh filter could get down to acceptable mineral levels, but how long it would stay there, and whether it mattered which one I used.

The headline result is a “Limescale Expert” can take London water into acceptable GH and KH ranges, for a certain length of time. You can push further with refiltering (not shown here), though you wont get the 100% control possible with purified (ZW, RO, distilled) water. I think you could make a case for checking with a TDS wand and basing refiltering and filter replacement on that (if you calibrate for your local water). At about one third the cost of a ZW filter it might also be an economical prefilter (possibly even stretching further if you are mixing Brita filtered and ZW water to remineralise).

The comparison is 3 filters: Brita Maxtra Pro “Limescale Expert” and “Pure Performance”, and Aquaphor “Maxfor+ Mg” (I wanted to try a magnesium-adding filter, BWT do one, but it doesn’t fit our Brita jugs). I also use two jugs, one light use and one heavy use. Mostly performance will depend on litres used, but that is a pain to track and for my own needs days used is good enough. The heavy use jug might do about 5l per day, 150l in 30 days (hot drinks and cooking if water needs boiled), while the light use one I’m less sure about, but maybe 1-1.5l per day (hot drinks weekdays only), so 30-45l. The Britas claim to do 150l, while Aquaphor claims 200l.

Method (briefly), general hardness (GH as CaCO3) with Calmag (early on) and API (mostly) droppers, KH (really alkalinity as CaCO3) with API dropper, conductivity wand for ppm TDS (a quicker and easier test, tried to do at room temp). Measured values for Evian, Volvic, GB4 (Ashbeck/Lockhills) and our local tap water are included as references, alongside SCA recommendations (green). Tried to keep jugs filled below the filter level as it continues to soften if submerged. That allows more softening, but adds variability (would also expect the filter to age faster, but not checked yet).

Data collection is a little sparse on the light-use Pure Performance, full month runs on the Maxfor+, full runs and partial data with extra filter sets for the Limescale Expert.

What do we see?

GH For all jugs in heavy use the GH rapidly climbs out of the recommended range, the Limescale Expert lasts the longest, to about 5 days. The less used jug goes to about 15 days within the GH range with both Limescale Expert and Pure Performance, the Maxfor+ Mg is adding magnesium, so it’s unsurprising it’s higher here. Measuring Mg accurately is hard, so not graphed, but it came out about 25mg/l for most of the life of the filter (initially this is higher than Ca), dropping to the 15-20mg/l range at the end. (Should be noted some recipes do push to the higher end of the GH recommended range and even above.) After 30 days the Limescale Expert still reduces GH somewhat below the tap water level.

KH maybe the most important, this dropped slightly over the first few days of use for all filters. In heavy use the Pure Performance and Maxfor+ Mg never get to the 40ppm target and track each other quite closely. The Limescale Expert gets there for a few days, but is climbing by day 9 or so. (With dropper titration, GH and KH might be below the measured level, but since there might be other inaccuracies I wouldn’t try to over interpret that.) In light use, again the KH falls a bit from its starting value, the Limescale Expert hovers near 40ppm, but likely a bit higher most of the time. The Maxfor Mg+ doesn’t quite get there, didn’t collect enough data on the Pure Performance, from the heavy use I expect it to be similar to the Maxfor Mg+. Even towards the end of its life the Limescale Expert is still knocking off some KH.

TDS, the same initial drop here as in KH. There’s a reason; if you read Brita’s manuals there is an initial potassium washout (I did follow manufacturer instructions for rinse before use). This has been observed by people with more sophisticated measures than I have ([Open access](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/jphd.12649#jphd12649-bib-0034)), and tails off after a few litres. I think this also explains why KH drops a little after first use, KH is removed by replacing the Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions with H+ ([Brita PDF](https://www.brita.co.uk/dam/jcr:16c46fc3-41e1-476b-b6b8-e27d9d87c12b/brita-professional-whitepaper-how-filtration-affects-coffee-flavour-en-INT.pdf), leading to the carbonate decomposing and the extra potassium may counteract this.

What the graphs don’t show though about the Maxfor+ Mg is a brief period at about 2-3 days old where coffee and tea were incredibly bitter with this water (which tasted fine on its own), followed by a short period (only a few uses) in which coffee or tea with it tasted very intense (particularly black tea, tasted nearly stewed after a normal brewing time). Not sure if this is something to do with the magnesium supplementation or a different aspect of the filter. It was less marked for the light use jug, in the heavy use jug I’d had to fit a little waterdrop insert to bypass the Brita flow control valve, it might be slowing the water through the filter. It seems like Mg supplementing filters might just not be suitable for decarbonating very hard water, which probably disadvantaged this filter. It’d be interesting to try the normal Maxfor+, although the bitter episode has led to some domestic resistance on that front. (The post-bitterness window is really interesting and would be nice to recreate, I don’t know if it’s magnesium related as I haven’t usually noticed a big change from adding magnesium at even higher levels.)

Plotting KH against TDS, for London tap water, it looks like the KH is in the 40ppm range for measured TDS < 210ish ppm, which is easier to monitor.

In conclusion these jug filters can reduce hardness and alkalinity (and TDS), while they differ in how much they do that they all seem to be doing decarbonisation, not sodium exchange (also the Brita manual that warns about potassium would also likely warn about sodium if it did). They may not reduce it sufficiently for everyone’s preferences with London water without refiltering (water that’s not so hard might be more successful), and how long they do will depend on how heavily you use them. If you do a little calibration then monitoring with a TDS wand might be enough to know when you want to change.",14,1770826273.0,pourover,2,0.94,False

I'll have about a month in total, split between Tokyo, Kyoto and the Iseji section of the Kumano Kodo. 

I have been to Kyoto before (spent 4 nights, visited Arashiyama, Fushimi, Nishiki, Kiyomizu, Setsubun at Yasaka) and going back, I would like to spend more time around the Philosopher's Path area, explore neighbourhoods and markets, visit Kurama and Kifune, and just spend time walking around and exploring. I enjoy visiting temples and shrines, as well as just wandering through shopping streets and department stores. (And obviously eating!)  
  
The plan at the moment is to stay in the Higashiyama/Gion area. I'm specifically looking at Gion because the area seems to have fewer ""high"" rise buildings and a high concentration of coffee shops and restaurants, as well as shrines and temples.

I have about 10 days for this part of the trip and I'm weighing up the pros and cons of staying at one place in Kyoto for 10 days versus staying for 5 days and then doing the Ise part of my trip and then coming back to Kyoto for 5 days. I don't want to feel like I'm constantly moving, but 10 days is quite a long time. 

The Ise part of my trip will involve staying in about four different places, so there's a fair bit of movement there. And I'm splitting Tokyo between beginning and end (4 days in Shibuya to start and then 6 days in Kichijoji at the end).

1r21eok,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r21eok,"China Part 1 - Shanghai (Fu He Hui, Da Vittorio, Taian Table)","I recently did a two-week trip to China and spent three days in Shanghai. Incredible city overall with an amazing dining scene.

Fu He Hui (Photos 1-4) was unfortunately very disappointing. For those unfamiliar, it’s a high-end vegetarian tasting menu. The ambiance was beautiful and service was friendly and professional, although it was a bit unusual that they don’t offer wines by the glass.

The food, unfortunately, just didn’t work for us. There was only one dish we truly enjoyed — the hairy gourd salad. They seemed very proud of using 16 different ingredients. Everything else felt underwhelming and lacked depth or excitement. We rarely leave dishes unfinished, but here we left most of the courses behind, which the staff didn’t seem particularly surprised by. Food wise I’d rate it around 3/10, maybe 4/10 overall including ambiance.

Thankfully, Da Vittorio Shanghai (5-7) was fantastic. Every single dish landed perfectly with no misses. Service was excellent and very polished. If you go for the full tasting menu, definitely ask them to include the Egg à la Egg and the tiramisu as additional courses — both were highlights.

Standout dishes were both pasta courses, the lobster, and the Egg à la Egg. Also a great touch was the menu, which comes as a small book — very creative and a great souvenir. Overall around 8–8.5/10.

Taian Table (8-12) was another highlight. I’m personally a big fan of chef’s table concepts, so this was an easy choice. The food was outstanding and we ended up talking with the head chef and sous chef for about 40 minutes, which made the experience even more memorable.

There were no weak courses, and even the desserts and petit fours were excellent — which says a lot because I usually dislike petit fours. Standouts for me were the chicken, turbot, and kanpachi. 8.5/10",7,1770826046.0,finedining,2,0.89,False

She screamed that at me ten years ago during a fight about my dad's will. I was 19, she was 23. We were arguing because my biological mom had left me a small inheritance and my stepsister thought she deserved half since ""we're all one family now."" I said no. She lost it. Started yelling about how I was adopted, how I wasn't real family, how I was just some charity case my dad took pity on.

My dad was standing right there in the kitchen doorway. He heard every word.

He said nothing. Just looked at his coffee mug.

I packed my stuff that night and left. My dad called twice while I was loading my car, asking where I was going, telling me not to be dramatic. I told him if I wasn't real family then I didn't need to stay. He said I was overreacting. I hung up and blocked both of them.

For ten years I built my own life. Got my degree, good job, small apartment. My dad would send emails on holidays that I never opened. My stepsister sent a friend request every few months that I ignored.

Then last month my dad showed up at my workplace. Security called me down because some older guy was crying in the lobby asking for me. It was him. He looked terrible, like he aged twenty years.

He said my stepsister had kidney disease. Stage 4. She needed a transplant. They'd tested everyone in the family and no one was a match. Then her doctor suggested they reach out to me since I was her stepsister, even though we hadn't spoken in a decade.

I laughed. I actually laughed right there in the lobby.

My dad started begging. Said she was dying. Said I was her only hope. Said family forgives.

I said, ""I'm not real family, remember? She made that very clear. You made it clear when you said nothing.""

He tried to grab my arm. Security stepped forward. He backed off but kept talking, saying she was sorry, saying she regrets it, saying people say things they don't mean when they're young and stupid.

I told him she was 23 when she said it. An adult. And he was 48 when he stood there silent and let her say it.

He said, ""So you're just going to let her die?""

I said, ""I'm going to let her ask her real family. You've got a whole side of relatives, right? Aunts, uncles, cousins who share actual DNA with her. I'm sure one of them will help.""

His face went red. He called me selfish. Called me cruel. Said my mom would be ashamed of me.

I told security to remove him.

He's called 47 times since then. Left voicemails crying, yelling, bargaining. Sent emails with pictures of my stepsister in a hospital bed looking weak and pale. Got relatives I haven't spoken to in years to message me calling me a murderer.

My stepsister sent one email herself. Subject line: ""I'm sorry."" I deleted it without reading.

Here's what nobody seems to remember: I was 15 when my mom died. My dad remarried less than a year later. I was still crying myself to sleep when my stepsister moved into my mom's spot at the table, redecorated my mom's garden, donated my mom's clothes because they were ""taking up space.""

I tried. I really did try to be okay with it all. And the one time I stood up for something that was mine, something my actual mom left me, my stepsister told me I wasn't real family and my dad confirmed it with his silence.

Now she needs me and suddenly I'm family again.

My coworker says I should at least get tested, that it's just giving information and I can decide after. Another friend says letting someone die over old hurt makes me as bad as them.

But I don't think I'm being cruel. I think I'm respecting the boundary she set ten years ago.

AITA?

PUBLIC BIO

Tech professional, musician, and“late bloomer” bisexual new to the M2M scene.

I’m a neat, bearded, not-quite-neurotypical introvert who enjoys mixing the perfect Old Fashioned, losing myself in the woods, tracking down the perfect Moroccan rug or vintage coffee table, and playing anything from Dylan to Mozart on my restored 1903 piano. My politics lean left, I value thoughtful conversation over small talk, and I’m far too proud of my absurdly long Duolingo streak. 

I’m looking to join a patient, respectful couple for male-focused play. I’m drawn to the couple dynamic, which feels like a mirror of my own story, but I’m definitely open to a solo guy if things click. I’m a giver by nature and interested in oral and maybe more—I’m still learning about myself!

My wife of 25 years is fully supportive. She’s out for the physical part, but would love to join us for a quick drink to make sure the vibes are right for everyone. For her comfort and mine, sexual interactions stay focused on the M2M.

<area code> based but travel friendly. Let’s start with a conversation!

1r20zfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1r20zfz/why_we_appreciate_but_would_not_sail_again_on/,Why we appreciate but would not sail again on Virgin Voyages - Review of Resilient Lady cruise,"This post is not to hate on Virgin but provide a rare, different perspective as several Redditors asked me to share why we did not like Virgin yesterday.\*\*\*

Wife and I went on a 7-day Resilient Lady cruise. We only paid $500 to board (on a casino comp), but admittedly would not go again, even at that price. It was not a terrible, unacceptable experience, but simply we would prefer a different cruise line. We have previously sailed on Royal and MSC, each several times.

First, the pros:

1)        For those who are LGBT or liberal, this is definitely a ship for you. It was nice to see a cruise line that truly embraces the “Come as you are” stance. While I do not identify as LGBT or liberal, I know that those who do often can feel uncomfortable or not welcomed. It was nice seeing how everyone welcomed each other and there was clearly a lot of folks of this group onboard.

2)        The Shows! We loved Percephone, Lola’s library, the Mind Mangler, and the crazy show (I forget the name, the one that was LGBT positive).

3)        The Coffees! We got free coffees as part of our casino comp and we really enjoyed them. My wife loves cappuccinos and lattes, and was in heaven all trip.

4)        If you are a foodie, you will likely enjoy Virgin. There are many different restaurants to choose from, all included.

5)        The fitness classes are fun and daily. We tried a few and enjoyed ourselves each time.

6)        The room attendants are very quick and were beyond helpful. If you needed water or room cleaned mid-day, they would do it.

7)        The ship offered a huge area with board games and such. We played several games throughout the cruise.

8) Scarlet night! People of all ages could enjoy the party night by the pool. It was cool seeing young, old and every in between dance on the pool. You can see that the employees are encouraged to be included as well. You often would see workers at the pools, Galley and all.

Next, the cons:

1)        While the food offerings are strong, they were a weakness for us, as two of the seven nights we got very sick after dinner. We felt the food was good but often too rich for us personally. We also felt the ship’s reservation really hurt us as we were unaware that Virgin does not meet local time. We had a reservation for 8:45pm at Extra Virgin, but that became 9:45pm actual time, as the ship did not adjust their time (like MSC/RCL). Due to a delay in the restaurant, we were not served our main entrées until almost 11pm local time. While delicious, we got very sick overnight and I could not eat for almost 24 hours after.

2)        We felt judged by the Happenings crew. Shocking to say, but we did. We tried participating in Mario Kart, Puzzling, and Karoake and we just did not experience a welcoming atmosphere, specifically from one female worker. This discouraged us from going to events again.

3)        We felt the cruise was best suited for solo travelers OR those who traveled in groups. We felt outcast due to issue #2, and being a bit extroverted hurt us. This was our issue, but felt worth mentioning.

4)        At several of the restaurants, we were seated next to or included in our group people that were extremely pompous, like they expected the world. We understand that Virgin caters to higher middle class or upper class, but hearing the comments that some passengers said, were disturbing. Derogatory comments about staff, lack of changes over the years, etc. Whereas on RCL or MSC, we would often meet people that were so grateful for the MDR or just a nice cruise away from stress.

5)        The lack of maps. On RCL / MSC, every elevator had a map of the boat’s offerings and where. You could not find a map anywhere on Virgin. Admittedly, I love arcades but did not come across the arcade until night 3, due to no maps. Did not even know it existed. I appreciate structure. I imagine Virgin wants people to find their way but for me, the planner, that did not match me. For others, they would appreciate the not knowing.

6)        The casino. There were not many games offered and my favorite, Baccarat was not onboard. More importantly, we were told all drinks ordered at the casino bar would be comped and not charged, however we were charged and had to get the charges removed. We got off the boat to find my wife still had casino bar charges from the last night and we are fighting to have them removed.

7)        Honestly, the pool and boat size. We’ve been on all sizes (NCL small, MSC/RCL medium, and RCL large). Virgin’s small pools encourages you to stay inside more. The smaller boat offers less to explore. I missed mid/large size being on this boat for 7 days.

8)        The constant waiting, like at amusement parks. For dinner, you would wait in line. For shows, you had to be 30-60 minutes early. On mid/large boats on MSC/RCL, you almost never have to do this except on night 1. Some folks thought they could skip the lines each night, which also was frustrating.

9)        We felt bored at times, especially middle of the day. On a smaller boat, that becomes an issue. When the main selling points from our view were the shows and food, and the food made us sick, it dampened our overall experience.

To be clear, I did not lose an exorbitant amount at the casino causing bias negative sentiment. This cruise helped me realize that while kids can sometimes be a pain, I really enjoy being a kid at some moments, like mini golf, rock climbing, water slides, and soft serve ice cream cones 24/7. I appreciate mid/large size boats more and that I’d say my ideal cruise length is 5 days. Virgin offers a good service, but we just didn’t enjoy it as much as other cruise lines. The weather likely did cause some negative bias, as it was cold throughout. For those in groups, solo, or LGBT, it definitely is a great boat for partying, feeling included, and meeting others, though at normal cruise price, expensive.",4,1770825106.0,VirginVoyages,39,0.55,False
1r20z9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r20z9q/me_25f_find_it_hard_to_say_no_to_my_motherinlaw/,"Me (25F) find it hard to say ''no'' to my mother-in-law (49F). What can I do to stay true to myself, while keep her satisfied?","Hi everyone, I got stuck in my own head about this, so I thought, let's ask for some advice here.

I have been together with my GF (19F) for almost 4 months now. She still lives at home as of right now, but is mostly at my place. She lives only 5 mins away and her mom has always mentioned that she doesn't have any negative feelings towards her being more at my place than hers, since I do have my own place.

She has an over-all good relationship with her mom. I do too and she's an amazing woman, but I do not feel the family bond as much, but that's mostly my fault, since I didn't get raised with a family bond, so I don't know how to feel/handle that or how to behave in that sense.

Her mom does everything for her/us. She has bought us a lot of things, also for Christmas, she fixes things in my house with my stepfather-in-law (74M), she renovates my house, even though I never asked her too.... My GF says that that is the way her family handles things, and that they don't expect anything back.

Just to be clear; the things they do in my house, they all do with my permission and they do because I mention that I PLAN to do that in the FUTURE, but that I don't have any time or money right now to do that. For example, a new closet, a new dishwasher, a new fridge/freezer, painting the walls, picking up my packages if I can't during working hours etc etc. I never ask them to do anything; they ask if they may and I ask a billion times if they are sure and that's when it will happen. I am extremely grateful, even though I don't know how to handle this form of ''family duties.'' I have asked a lot of times if there is anything I can do back or give money for the things they do and purchase for me, but they refuse as I am now a part of the family for them.

But here's the thing. Even though my mother-in-law says she doesn't expect anything back, her requests, actions and behaviour says otherwise. She recently got upset with my GF while I was at work that my GF isn't home enough and that she expects her to be home more. We do come over once every 2 to 3 days, for a coffee, a quick meet-up or to pick stuff up or drop them off. But that isn't enough. Keeping in mind that she always has mentioned that she doesn't mind at all how much she sees us, made me a little uncomfortable.

When we are over at theirs, there are sometimes fights, also with a lot of screaming, crying. I find it hard to be in such environment, since I got raised like that too and I did what I could to heal from that, even though it came with permanent damage. It triggers me a lot and I need a full day after that to recharge emotionally to process that.

That's why I don't want to come over too often. I work 40 hours a week, I have to clean my house, have a social life, pay my bills, take care of my cats, take care of my GF and take care of myself after all. 

I have mentioned before to my GF that I don't mean it personally, but it seems like they do take it like that, when I tell them that I need some time to myself instead of coming over on a workday-night till 11PM while I have work early in the morning the next day. 

I just need some alone time once in a while to recharge from everything and everyday life, but I feel like that some people see that as a personal attack when I do tell them ''no'' and with the explanation that it is nothing personal, but that I just want some alone time.

Keeping in mind that they do a lot for me in my house and to take care of me and my GF, I find it hard to say ''no'' to my mother-in-law now, because it just feels like it will come back to me somehow... It indirectly feels like I owe it to her?

Is it normal that I feel like this? Am I being ungrateful? Do I OWE it to her? How can I say ''no''?

I (28F) have never known my birth dad, but had a step dad from 4yo to 16yo who i was made to call ‘dad’ He was all i knew and was very abusive in many ways that i don’t want to burden any readers going into as it is incredibly dark. My mum wouldn’t listen to my cries for help in this time, and still won’t take any accountability for what happened to me, so from the age of 18, i have been out on my own, in and out of therapy and still to this day really struggling mentally and physically (why do survivors get so many chronic pain conditions when they get older i do not know, SO unfair) 

Last year, i found my birth dad and 3 older brothers on facebook, thanks to some dna testing and internet stalking. i’ve never had a family i can talk to, so finding out i have 3 brothers all with lots of kids each and actually a huge family, i was pretty excited. i also found out they ALL lived 20 MINS FROM ME MY ENTIRE LIFE. i thought it was best to reach out to my birth dad first. he was shocked but said he ‘knew this day would come’ and we had a phone call to work out if what i had been told about him was true- He cheated on his wife and kids with my mum, and left when she got pregnant. he told me NO ONE knows about me, about him cheating, any of it- and he wants to keep it that way. I agreed and text him a few times but he really didn’t seem interested in getting to know me at all. i asked for some pictures as i wanted to see if we looked alike, and he said he didn’t have any. i’ve asked to meet for a coffee, and he’s said he was busy. i’ve tried to check in and message but honestly i think this is all too much for him, and now i don’t know what to say. i can’t force a connection? 

on the phone call- i told him what my childhood was like, and he said ‘oh i feel so bad, cos if i didn’t leave- none of this would have happened to you’ and ‘i’ve never had a daughter, it breaks my heart that someone would do that to one’ 

i also bought up that i live just down the road from this entire side of this family, in a VERY small town. i asked how on earth could he live knowing i was out there an not even knowing my name!? what if one of my BROTHERS bought me home?? and honestly, he said never even thought of this. i was disgusted. still, i tried to check in and text but just no interest or reply. 

over the last few months, I’ve worked though the fact he doesn’t care or want anything and i’m okay with that. i have been out on my own my whole adult life and have made it this far right? but i can’t help but feel i deserve some kind of help from this man? i didn’t ask to be here, i know no one does but i feel as though ive been birthed into inevitable failure. 

i have been in and out of hospital this year, getting diagnosed with HEDS and fibro and a lot of therapists telling me it’s to do with my trauma. i’ve spent so much money on therapy to work though what i went through, and now the physical and mental pain means i can no longer work as much. i really WANT to work, i just can’t, and the (UK) government won’t give me any financial support until i have more diagnosis’s for the mental side of things. i’ve been on wait lists for this my entire life, and still haven’t been seen. i think the only way im going to get someone to look into this is to pay privately, but i can’t afford this now im hardly able to work. 

I want to ask him for help, and feel as i deserve it from him, but also… he didn’t CAUSE this trauma directly. my step dad did, and my mum let it happen, it’s almost nothing to do with this random man i’ve found so i feel insane and evil to expect this from him- but i think i do because of his lack of care for me? im no contact with the rest of my family so its unfair to want this from him right? i just feel so alone and stuck and really do not want to be.

because of all i have been through, i find it REALLY hard to ask for help, so i won’t ask him for it, financially or emotionally- especially because he doesn’t even seem to care i exist.. but i NEED help.. i really do and he’s all i have? do i ask? is that fair? or am i just looking for anyone to blame/ take responsibility after years of struggling alone. 

thank you so much for reading if you made it this far. ",3,1770825094.0,TwoHotTakes,33,0.6,False
1r20yxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Critical_Rub7034/comments/1r20yxm/how_i_used_local_seo_ai_to_finally_get_my_small/,How I Used Local SEO & AI to Finally Get My Small Business Showing Up on ‘Near Me’ Searches,"So I finally figured out why my little bakery downtown was invisible online while every trendy coffee shop two blocks over kept popping up in search results. I’d been doing the usual stuff decent website, some blog posts, a **Google Business Profile** but nothing serious. Then I stumbled into **geotargeting for SEO**, and honestly it felt like someone handed me the secret map to the local digital world.

Geotargeting is basically SEO that *actually cares about where your customers are*. Instead of hoping someone finds you by Googling general terms, it lets you tailor your content to people right in your city or neighborhood like showing “best fresh bread in *\[Your Town\]*” to someone searching nearby. Once I got that, everything clicked.

So I started by really optimizing my **Google Business Profile** full address, photos, hours, the whole deal and suddenly I wasn’t just a name on Google, I was *the* local bakery people could find on Maps. Then I used tools to help with **local keyword research**, making sure my pages spoke the same language as my neighbors’ searches things like “artisan sourdough near me at lunch time.” Getting specific was eye-opening.

I didn’t stop there. I built separate landing pages for different local areas we service, each with unique text, local references, even testimonials from customers in those neighborhoods. That boosted our local relevance big time. Something about speaking directly to your community’s searches just *works*.

Then came the AI side of things. I started using AI tools to help analyze local search trends and generate the right kind of content without feeling like I was guessing at what people would type. The AI helped find patterns I never would’ve spotted just by looking at analytics myself. It felt less like marketing and more like understanding actual locals.

Now when someone types “fresh pastries nearby,” our bakery actually shows up, not just in some vague list but right up there where people can see it. And yes, the foot traffic followed. Who knew SEO could be so… neighborhood friendly?

I am so thankful to all of you for your patience the last week and change. I’ve never had to process that many watches in that short amount of time and with the day job being demanding, I had to handle it all before the day began and afterwards.

I will do everything I can to get several shipments sent out the first day things resume to have some general

Inventory on its way. 

But for now, this is what I had for the next several

Weeks. 

While we are talking several weeks. Travis and I have some day job stuff coming up and will be out of town 

That will mean that orders placed might not be sent out immediately. 

Communication might be a bit slow and sloppy. Remember, our days jobs come first always. And when we are on the road, it’s tough to answer chats timely. 

Just please be patient with us. And it’s ok to ask questions again if you didn’t get an answer promptly. It means we slipped through the cracks. 

With Valentine’s Day coming up let me say this to our community. 

Travis and I love you all. You have been an absolute blessing to us and we appreciate each and every one of you for your kindness, your generosity, and your passion for watches. Thank you 🙏

checked my weather app, says 31 degrees.  whoo!! so warm! don't need a hat today!



emerge from the house: porch, stairs, driveway, sidewalk, street - all complete ice glaze.  uh-oh. better tread carefully!



make it to the bus stop, but cant actually stand AT the stop because it is smooth ice, and slanted.  stand in a slush pile on the street.  i have the right footwear, so this is fine.  i feel smart.



manage the walk to the gym without incident, although it takes me almost twice as long.  VERY icy.



gym class goes fine.



afterwards i normally shower off, get dressed and then trek to work (about a mile across town). but today the shower suddenly turns ICY cold and then just stops.  ok, i wasn't soapy yet, so get dressed and move on with the day.  i am resilient.



but i have only begun to dress when the fire alarm goes off.  jeeeebers it is LOUD. throw on the minimum amount of clothes, dash out of the shower spot, grab my boots/bag/coat and evacuate.  with a towel on my head.



on the sidewalk, i finish dressing, tie my boots, comb out my hair, gather my composure. with a whole gym full of evacuees as witness.  also some passing traffic.  ugh.



i am resilient!



ok, onward.  start the trudge across town. 



hit a REALLY icy patch, which i can SEE is icy, yet cannot avoid.  it is also sloped downhill. 



well i try to just slide it, but my feet come out from under and i tumble ass-over-teakettle like a cartoon buffoon.  in front of THREE construction workers, dagnabbit. i do not feel smart.



they form a human chain to get me back up.  they get their good deed for the day.



ok, onward.  resume the very, very wary trudge.  i must look crazy tiptoeing across spots that are just wet, according to everyone else who hasn't had this start to the day.



get to the coffee shop AT LAST.  the rest of the walk is indoors. i made it.



coffee lady says ""how is your day?"" and i said ""exhilarating, actually.""



then i just bust out laughing, and i cannot stop.  tears pouring down and nose running, i cannot stop. 



eventually i regain control, and the coffee is handed to me WITH A COOKIE, no charge.

Any feedback?,"I am doing a trial session for 2d20 to see if GMing is for me or not. My player wants to play as a Robobrain (*only one player as it is a trial session, after all*). I thought that General Atomics Galleria would be a good place to start as there are a lot of Mr. Handy robots. I have prepared some screenshots from the game/wiki for better understanding of the location, as well as 3 maps - General Atomics Galleria, Back Alley Bowling, and Commonwealth itself. I also inserted all mr. Handy robots on the map.

What is more, I prepared some intro texts. Feel free to use it if you want it.

For waking up:

>Your vision slowly boots up, shifting from complete darkness onto the cold concrete floor of the Back Alley Bowling – a place you know too well. Despite living there for what feels like forever, you never quite felt like it is where you belong. Yet, you never found a good enough reason to leave, maybe because of uncertainties of the outside world, maybe because of your family that surrounded you.

>You notice a Mr. Handy drifting in the air not far from you, polishing floors for customers that never seem to come. It took you a moment to recognise that it was Strike, as this Mr. Handy had a very distinguishable rust mark on its side. Strike noticed you as well, immediately stopping the polishing and hurrying to you.

>“Oh, finally! We started getting worried about you.”

>They call you a family, a part of them, sometimes even the “odd one”. Every time you see your reflection, you are reminded of why they call you such – you and they are nothing alike. Their bodies are light, elegant, graceful… Yours, on the other hand, is big, clumsy, and heavy. But they still accept you, no matter what.

For exiting Back Alley Bowling:

>You exit the darkness of Back Alley Bowling into the bright sunlight that is nearly blocked by an enormous building in the shape of a Mr. Handy, which is occupying the middle of General Atomics Galleria. Somewhere in the distance, you can heal Greeter, rather annoying Mr. Handy, scream, “Welcome, valued customers, to the General Atomics Galleria! Where tomorrow’s goods are available TODAY!”

>Every day, it is the same – Mr. Handys float around the territory, trying to serve non-existent customers. General Atomics Galleria was supposed to be a futuristic shopping district with a department store, bakery, coffee house, diner, bowling alley, gym, and of course, a shop where humans could purchase the newest models of Mr. Handys to serve them. Now it looked more like a ghost town with breaking buildings, spoiling food, and weed pushing through the cracks in the concrete.

>Unlike others, you do not have specific tasks such as maintaining the shop or taking care of buildings, so your days can be quite different from what Mr. Handys do. And yet, this freedom reminds you of how different you are from others.

Random encounter: Near Handy eats – conversation about failing power supply.

The beginning of a quest:

>The Director: “You are well aware that a week ago we sent Guard Dusty to scout the area and return with any possible information about where we could retrieve a fusion core for our failing power supplies. No matter the outcomes, he should have been returned by now. I am worried that something might have happened to him. Since your charge lasts remarkably longer than the other robots’, I want you to go and look for him.” (annoying and screechy voice)

I tried to take the inspiration from the in game location (obviously), the fallout 1 water-chip issue, as well as the quest book I have.

I also have a reason of why robobrain is among mr. Handy robots - >!Shortly, the director murdered a person when he came to shut the place down, the brain got placed into a robot with someone else's help, robobrain lost memories of his past, and has been living with mr. Handy robots since then.!<

Dogs automatically get my approval. 💯

A SINGLE guy (please naman don’t make me a kabit!!! 😭)

(i think one of her friends did the same) Our basement is highly useable but not finished, one big room, no water or moisture but concert floors, cinderblock walls, outlets spread around the room. The furnace is down there as well as our laundry area, and 2 outside access doors that have locks and deadbolts, and since its a outside facing basement it gets a little colder in the winter and warmer in the summer. She obviously knows all this. I currently use an open part of the basement as a home office so that i wouldn't take a bedroom from one of the kids. The only real problem i have with it is the door access, but i have cameras so im not overly worried about them. When she asked about this, instead of just dismissing the idea we talked about it and all the issues she may have from above (like the temperature differences) and told her me and my wife would talk about it and let her know. I want to her be able to make decisions for her life and try things out even if they arnt good ideas or something that makes sense long term, so i see this more as a life lesson type situation. when i was in highschool i moved into my parents basement and really enjoyed it, but that was a different situation.

Since its one big room we thought about at first just putting up big curtain to make sudo walls and a giant area rug as temporary stuff in case she changes her mind, kinda like a trail run and if she ends up liking it i can build real walls down the road. We also thought about getting a small couch and coffee table to feel more like her space and extra area for when she has friends over.

1r20kx2,https://pawfreaks.co/products/from-anxiety-to-calmness-paw-freaks,I didn’t have a stubborn dog—I was accidentally making his separation anxiety worse.,"This realization hit me at 11:45 PM, sweeping up the remains of my living room blinds, crying out of pure exhaustion because I felt like a prisoner in my own home.

  


$1,200 in damage. Complaints from the neighbors about the howling. And the guilt? Unbearable.

  


The local dog trainer’s words kept echoing in my head: ""He’s just testing you. Put him in the crate, let him cry it out. Don't let him win.""

  


Let him cry it out? I did. I bought the indestructible crate. I bought the thunder vests. I bought the calming chews I did the ""tough love.""

  


Yet there I was, holding a shredded blind, watching my dog shake uncontrollably in the corner, panting so hard his drool was hitting the floor.

  


My friend Sarah, who works with rescue dogs in the UK, had FaceTimed me earlier. Her dogs? Relaxed. Happy. And she leaves them for hours.

  


""Maybe he needs more exercise?"" I asked, desperate.

  


She shook her head. ""It’s not energy, it’s panic. You’re trying to use logic on a brain that is currently experiencing a biological panic attack.""

  


That didn't make sense. I thought he was just being bad.

  


So, late that night, I stopped looking at ""Dog Training"" videos and started looking at ""Canine Neuroscience"" papers. Real behaviorist studies.

  


What I found made me feel stupid. Then guilty. Then relieved.

  


In the standard dog training world, we are taught that a dog barking when left alone is ""misbehavior"" that needs to be corrected.

  


But according to actual animal psychology? It’s a literal panic attack.

  


When a dog has separation anxiety, their cortisol levels (the stress hormone) spike to the same levels as a human being chased by a predator.

  


And here is the kicker: When we use the ""Cry It Out"" method or force them into a crate when they are terrified, we aren't teaching them to be independent. We are validating their fear.

  


We are teaching them: ""You were right to be scared, because I locked you in here and ignored you.""

  


I pulled up a comparison of ""Obedience Training"" vs. ""Systematic Desensitization.""

  


Obedience Training (Sit, Stay, Crate) relies on the dog’s thinking brain. Separation Anxiety (Panic, Destruction, Howling) happens in the dog’s emotional brain.

  


You cannot ""Command"" a dog not to panic, just like you can't command a human not to be afraid of heights while dangling them off a cliff.

  


The study’s conclusion was blunt: ""Obedience protocols fail in separation anxiety cases because they address the symptom (the barking) rather than the cause (the fear).""

  


Translation: I was trying to teach him algebra while he was running from a burning building.

  


I looked at the stack of ""training guides"" on my counter. The ones that told me to be the ""Alpha."" The ones that told me to use a shock collar.

  


They were all useless. Because fear isn't a behavior. It's an emotion.

  


I started looking for a method that actually addressed the emotion. Not ""training"" commands, but actual nervous system regulation.

  


I found a methodology called ""From Anxiety to Calmness."" It wasn't a list of tricks. It was a guide on how to reset a dog's panic threshold.

  


The concept was ""Sub-Threshold Training.""

The physics of it made sense immediately. Standard training pushes a dog until they fail (bark/cry), then corrects them.

  


This guide keeps the dog below the panic line, slowly rewriting their brain to realize: ""Oh, being alone is actually safe.""

  


But here is the objection I had—I thought, ""I don't have time for this. I need to leave the house NOW.""

  


The guide explained that by pushing too fast (leaving for 30 minutes when the dog can only handle 30 seconds), I was resetting the clock to zero every single day.

  


I was taking one step forward and five steps back.

This guide laid out a specific, step-by-step roadmap. 

  


No ""Alpha"" dominance. No expensive gadgets. No drugging the dog.

  


Just a structured way to desensitize the trigger.

  


It showed me that the ""Departure Cues"" (picking up keys, putting on shoes) were triggering his anxiety before I even opened the door. 

  


The guide showed me how to neutralize those triggers first.

  


I decided to try it. I had nothing left to lose (except maybe my doorframe).

  


Day 1. We didn't even leave the house. We just worked on the ""Keys"" trigger. I picked them up. Put them down. Tossed him a treat.

No reaction.

  


Day 3. I opened the door and closed it immediately. No panic. No panting.

  


Day 14. I walked to the mailbox and back.\*

  


I watched him on the camera. He lifted his head... and then put it back down on his paws.

  


He didn't howl. He didn't pace. He just... waited.

  


Six weeks later. I went to meet a friend for coffee. I was a nervous wreck, checking the camera app every 45 seconds.

  


My friend asked, ""Is he tearing the place up?""

I turned the screen to her.

  


He was asleep. On his back. Legs in the air.

""I thought you said he had separation anxiety?"" she asked.

  


""He did,"" I said. ""But we stopped trying to train him, and started trying to heal him.""

  


The difference is massive.

  


We are over here trying to ""force"" our dogs to be independent, while their brains are screaming for safety.

  


Your dog’s destruction isn't spite. It’s not because they are spoiled. And it’s definitely not your fault for loving them too much.

  


It might just be that you’re using a ""Training Tool"" to fix a ""Medical Panic"" problem.

  


The solution isn't a stronger crate or a louder ""NO!""

  


It’s understanding the biology of their fear and speaking a language their nervous system understands.

  


I can finally leave my house without guilt. I can go to the grocery store without dreading what I’ll find when I come back.

  


My dog isn't ""obediently waiting."" He is genuinely calm.

  


If you are stuck in that prison, staring at the camera, wondering why the ""expert advice"" isn't working...

  


It’s likely because you’re solving the wrong problem.

  


You don't need a better dog. You just need a better roadmap.

  


You can find the method I used in the ""From Anxiety to Calmness"" guide. It’s the only thing that treated the root cause, not just the symptoms.

1r20k2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r20k2k/room_for_dessert/,Room For Dessert,"The tiny brass bell tinkled a familiar greeting as Cerise entered the dining room of Hank's All-Nite Diner. 

She walked past the booths, nodding in approval at the clean tables and fully-stocked caddies containing salt and pepper shakers, napkins, and ketchup packets. It was always nice when the previous shift left her a clean place--not that it mattered, as business was slow at this time of night and she'd have plenty of time to find things to tidy up.

She walked around the front counter into the ""back of house area"", where she hung up her coat and purse on the pegs near the office door and gently knocked on the swinging saloon door leading to the kitchen.

""Evenin', Junior. Gonna clock in and restock the pie display. Let me know if you need anything.""

A stocky, balding man with a sheen of sweat across his forehead looked up from the tomato slicer and grunted. Hank Junior, or Junior as anyone familiar with the diner called him, had inherited the place from his father after he'd died. A quiet, authoritative sort of man, agreeable enough as long as you did your job and didn't take too many smoke breaks on your shift. He looked back down and continued sawing away at another beefsteak tomato.

Cerise entered the walk-in cooler, grabbed a thawed Key Lime pie and kicked the door shut behind her with one graceful swing of a leg. She walked back up to the front counter, lifted the glass top off of the pie display, removed the empty pie tray, and placed the fresh pie in it's place. 

She scarcely had time to wipe her hands on the front of her apron before the tiny bell tinkled out another happy greeting. 

A short, disheveled looking man in his sixties with a brown coat and faded blue stocking cap entered the diner and shuffled into the corner booth on the far side of the diner, near the restrooms. Cerise gave him a smile and flirtatious wink.

""There's my boyfriend, coming to check up on me. How's life treatin' ya, Dave?""

The man looked up at her and sucked his teeth. 

""Aw, hell, Cerise, if I'd knew we was still goin' hot and heavy I'd brought you flowers.""

Cerise giggled and brought over a hot cup of coffee with a spoon and 3 sugars. Dave took the cup and smelled the hot steam rising from it, nodding appreciatively.

""How much for the joe, sweetheart?""

""Same price as always, Dave. Your pretty smile is all I charge.""

Cerise gave him another playful wink and walked back behind the counter. She liked Dave. He was a bit down on his luck. Had been for as long as she had known him, really. When he wasn't at the diner, he could be found at the bus station nearby, looking for dropped change or empty cans to trade in for cash. He never bothered anyone--on the contrary, he was quiet, sober, and always kept the staff company on late night shifts when it got a little spooky being alone.

Junior looked through the small open partition between the kitchen and the front counter where orders could wait to be served and nodded to Cerise.

""Dave get his coffee?""

""Yep, he's all set. Need anything?""

""Nah. Gonna go out back and have a smoke. Holler if I get an order.""

He plodded through the back of house and opened the back door leading to a fenced-in concrete slab where the dumpsters were placed.

Cerise watched him leave, then turned back around to begin assembling silverware into napkin-wrapped sets and was startled to see a man sitting on one of the stools at the front counter, near the pie display.  The bell had never rang its cheery warning. She looked over at Dave, hoping for an explanation or at least a shared look of confusion. He was asleep, head tilted back against the booth. With the poise only a waitress with her experience could possess, she recovered from the initial shock and stepped over to the man.

He was thin, of average height, with a short crop of slicked blonde hair parted on one side, and was wearing a slightly wrinkled black business suit. 

He was eyeing the pie display with a sort of desperate predation, a stare Cerise had only seen once before in a nature documentary about endangered wolves. Cerise produced a laminated menu from under the counter and placed it in front of him. He didn't seem to notice, or perhaps didn't care, and continued to stare at the pie.

""Well, howdy, can't help but notice you've taken a shine to the pie. Best pie you can get in these parts. Can I get you a slice, maybe a coffee to go with it?"" 

After a moment, the man wrenched his gaze from the pie and looked at her. His eyes were icy blue and Cerise thought she could see the entire diner reflected in them. He coughed wetly, and glanced down at the menu. He spoke only two words, in a low, harsh tone:

""I'm hungry.""

Cerise knew there was something wrong with the man. She'd seen it all before, of course. Drunks, or a traveling salesman that had taken just one too many pills to stay awake and was having the mother of all freakouts. Most times, they'd enter and leave with no trouble. Junior had a reputation for keeping the place trouble-free, and most people obliged. And besides, Dave was here. He was old but a second pair of fists in a fight was better than nothing.

No, this man wasn't trouble--not regular, boys-will-be-boys, ""aw shucks we're just having fun"" trouble--he was wrong. But until something actually happened, she'd have to play it cool.

""Well, you're at the right place if you're hungry. Take a gander at the menu, and in the meantime I'll tell the cook we got a hungry one on our hands.""

She offered a friendly smile and tried her best to walk to the rear of the diner without turning around to look back at the man. She failed at this. She glanced over her shoulder but the man was not looking at her, only studying the menu like it was a strange, alien artifact. She opened the door to the back exit and waved Junior over.

""We got a real doozy of a fella, Junior. Think he might be a tweaker. Says he's hungry.""

Junior pressed his cigarette into the stone bricks of the diner's exterior, and put it back into the pocket of his apron.

""Cerise, a man bein' hungry ain't nothin' to go hysterical over. I'll be in the kitchen. Just put his order in and quit freaking yourself out."" He walked back inside and let the door swing shut.

Cerise sighed, sucked in a breath of chilly desert air and followed him. She walked back to the front counter where the man had folded the menu shut in front of him. His eyes were wide and unblinking. Cerise produced a pen and pad of paper from her apron pocket and  prepared to take his order.

""Okay, what can I get you tonight, hon?""

The man slowly looked up at her. He licked his dry lips and began to speak.

""4 fried eggs. Bacon. And sausage. Toast. 6 Pancakes. With syrup and fruit.""

Cerise nodded at each entry, trying to stay professional but inwardly astonished at the volume of food. Hell, this man really was hungry.

""All righty sir, I'll just go back and--""

The man coughed loudly.

""Not done. Large order of hashbrowns. A cheeseburger. With bacon. A vanilla milkshake. A coffee. Thank you.""

Cerise had lost all professional impartiality and was staring at him, eyes wide. Then she remembered herself and blinked a few times, and tried to regain her inflappable waitress stoicism. 

""Well, The cook will get right on all that. Hope you saved room for that pie.""

She nearly ran to the kitchen. Junior was inside, sagely observing a fly circling the flourescent lights. 

""Hope you're ready to cook. Here's you're order."" She rolled her eyes at him. Junior mouthed the order to himself silently.

""I thought this guy was alone.""

Cerise leaned back and threw up her hands in dramatic exasperation.

""A man being hungry is nothing to go hysterical over, Junior."" She rolled her eyes and marched back up front.

At the front counter, the man was still sitting there, but he was different now. A look of pain was on his face, and he gripped the countertop tightly with both hands, knuckles white. He looked at Cerise with an almost pitiable expression of despair.

""How. Much longer. Ma'am? So hungry."" 

The man's voice was pleading, childlike in its insistence. His hollow cheeks shone pale in the harsh light. Cerise almost lost her fear over the concern she felt for the man.

""Well the cheeseburger will take the longest, but the eggs and all that won't take much time. I'll get your coffee and milkshake right now."" 

The man stared blankly at her, and nodded after a moment. Dave had also awoken at some point, and was eyeing the man with barely veiled suspicion. He shot Cerise a knowing look, almost telepathic in its own way: are we going to have a problem with this guy?

Cerise returned a look of her own: just keep an eye out for now. She hoped the intended meaning was clear. Dave looked at her, then nodded and turned back to his coffee. He shifted slightly in his seat so he could observe the man better.

Cerise poured the coffee and brought it over to the man, then went to work preparing the milkshake. 4 huge scoops of vanilla ice cream, milk and a splash of vanilla syrup went into the motorized mixer, and she expertly blended it into a frothy slurry--not too thick, not too runny--then she poured it into a clear glass and topped it with whipped cream and a cherry. This she also placed in front of the man. 

He regarded it with a look a man lost in a desert might reserve for a well spring. He removed the straw and spoon from the glass, gripped it with both hands, and loudly gulped the contents down, unmindful of his astonished observers. When he finally set the glass down empty, his mouth had a thick ring of cream that slowly dripped down his chin and onto his suit collar. If the previous events hadn't rattled her so much, Cerise would have found it amusing. Now, it was just bizarre and slightly grotesque. She offered him a napkin and he absent-mindedly dabbed his face and neck. 

""Order up!"" Junior belted from the partition. Cerise could almost hear the disbelief and amusement in his voice.

Cerise grabbed a large serving tray and began assembling the man's many plates onto it. I better get one hell of a tip out of this, she thought. She returned to the man and laid out his feast before him. He had recovered from his milkshake episode and was eyeing the plates of food greedily.

""Here you go sir. If you need a refill on that coffee just holler, otherwise I'll leave you be."" 

The man ignored her and began to shovel the food into his gaping maw. His skin had taken on a sallow, glistening, sickly shade and Cerise could almost see  a vaporous steam rolling off of him from the exertions he made to consume as much as possible, in as short a time as possible. 

After a moment, he threw his fork and knife to the floor, and in a howl of frustration began scooping runny eggs, strips of bacon and meat, lumps of potatoes into both hands and shoving them into his mouth. 

Cerise couldn't believe it. He was a man possessed, disregarding all humanity in his pursuit of satiating this gluttonous, impossible appetite. She turned to Dave, and he locked terrified eyes with her. Those eyes said it all.

Call the police.

Cerise slowly backed away and tried to casually return to the kitchen, but panic won out and she stumbled wildy into the back area reaching into her purse blindly for her cellphone. After her fingers returned nothing useful, she realized she had left her phone in the car.

She raced into the kitchen, slamming through the saloon doors and making them crash against the wall. Junior jerked up and turned to face her in shock.

""Cerise, what the hell-""

She grabbed his shoulders and locked panicked eyes with him.

""Call the police, Junior.""

Junior opened his mouth to speak, but glanced through the partition to the man in the dining room, saw the scene taking place, and cursed under his breath.

""Ah shit. Come with me.""

They partly walked, partly ran into the back office, where Junior picked up the phone and dialed the number to the local police. After a few moments, he spoke.

""Hey Diane, yeah, it's Junior. We might have a situation here at the diner. Yeah, might be a real circus. Ok, yeah. I appreciate it.""

Junior was still talking as Cerise slowly left the office and walked into the hallway leading to the front counter. The loud noises of slurping and chewing had stopped. Suddenly, a crash of broken glass and a harsh cry jolted her body into panic mode. She could hear Junior loudly curse as she ran back up to the counter. That man must have broken into the damn pie display to eat it, she thought. Goddammit.

But what she saw as she reached the sounds of chewing and smacking that had started up again sent her into a crescendo of hysterical, deafening screams. 

The pie display was indeed broken, but the man wasn't there. He was at the booth where Dave had been sitting, and was using a jagged shard of glass to saw into Dave's bare chest, tearing off thick chunks of flesh and slurping them down between barely finished chews. He stopped and turned back to look at Cerise. His mouth and neck dripped and hung with gore and viscera, a sinister glint of animalistic hunger in his eyes. 

He smiled for the first time, then, and spoke through a mouthful of blood and flesh. 

""I think I'll take that pie, now.""

“I’ve been holding in that grumble of despair since 8 AM, I swear. Hey, hon… How was your day?” 


[Pause <3] 


“Good. I’m glad you had a good day, sweetheart.” 


[He sighs and shuts his eyes] 


“...I missed you.” 


[SFX: Hair pets for fairly long hair] 


[Pause?] 


“Mmh, it was a day. Same old, same old… Tony chased Tom around the construction site for a solid ten minutes after the dumbass showed up at the wrong site. Again. With the company truck smelling particularly ‘green’, hehe.” 


[Pause <3] 


[He snorts, smiling against your leg] 


“Construction is a hoot, for sure. Keeps you in shape, at least, right? I’m gonna be eighty years old and still princess carrying you every chance I get.” 


[Pause???] 


“Because picking up my tiny little partner while they protest brings me joy? I’m a simple man, hon. Feed me, pat me on the head, laugh at my dumb jokes, and I’m basically smitten.” 


[Pause~] 


“Hmhm, well… It works when *you* do it, at least…” 


[Pause <3] 


“...How are you feeling, by the way? That cough sounds like it’s getting worse, not better, and we’ve thrown every over-the-counter medicine we can get at it.” 


[Pause!] 


[He frowns, sitting up to look at you]


“Baby, I think we need to take you to the doctor.” 


[...P-Pause] 


“No, no, listen to me. Look at me.” 


[He cups your face, making you look at him] 


“I told you that you can’t keep doing that, hon… You promised that you’d let me take care of you; you’ve been taking care of me for most of our damned lives! I know you worry about our finances, and I know you feel guilty about being too sick to work right now, but you *have* to let me help, sweetheart… You’re my partner, not my caretaker. You don’t have to keep sacrificing for me.” 


[Pause…] 


[His expression softens, and he pulls you close, quiet and pained] 


“Oh, sweetheart… You always worry about them making fun of me for being a forest kid… I get it. Civilized people look down on us. Hasn’t changed, probably never will, but I swear to you, it doesn’t bother me.” 


[Pause?] 


“Of course not. We survived the collapse of a whole city, and we survived out in the forests on our own for years. We’re more capable than most of the idiots in this city, but they’re still going to look down on us no matter what we do. There’s always going to be people at the bottom, and there’s always going to be people who use them to feel better about themselves. There’s no sense in caring about them.” 


[Pause…] 


“...Do you know how amazing you are?” 


[P-Pause?] 


“I do think so. I know so. When we met, we were both barely teens, trying to survive out in a wilderness that wanted us dead. You were hurt, but you still rallied everyone together. You were the one who thought to build houses away from the forest floor, the one who tended to the younger kids when they got sick… The one who saved my life. I can’t imagine what it feels like to have a drive to want to help everyone… and be constantly knocked down.” 


[. . . ] 


[He kisses you gently, and you return it] 


[Pause <3] 


“There’s a little smile…Money is tight, but we’ll figure it out, OK? I can eat beans and rice for a few weeks, and the coffee at work is stronger than a cigarette. I don’t want to see you skipping meals anymore just so my lunch box is a little fuller.” 


[. . . ] 


“Yes, I noticed… I know I’m not exactly winning science awards, but we’ve been together for so long, I’ve just kind of become aware of all your sneaky little techniques. Like how you soft-boil an egg for my instant ramen but insist you’re fine with yours plain.” 



[. . . ] 


“Pfft, pout all you want, but decorated ramen is simply better. I’m gonna learn how to make it from scratch one of these days so you can see what it’s actually supposed to taste like.” 


[Pause~] 


“Mhm, good ol’ bone soup, hehe… Maybe if Tony actually gets us our bonuses, we can go somewhere for Valentine’s Day.” 


[Pause??] 


“Apparently, it’s a day for people who love each other. Or a day to buy a fuckton of crap and try to prove that you love your partner, I guess, I dunno. The guys were all panicking because they didn’t know what to get their spouses and such. Dan deadass had to go sit in the porta-potty and cry for a few minutes.” 


[Pause???] 


[He shrugs, rubbing your back] 


“I don’t get it either… City folk are weird. The whole city is all pink and red right now, so I guess it must be an important holiday. And if it’s important, you should get to enjoy it, too.” 


[Pause…] 


[SFX: The train rumbling in the distance] 


[You jump at the familiar rumble, and he quickly holds you more tightly, covering your head] 


“Shh… shh, it’s just the train…” 


[P-Pause..] 


“I know, baby… Just try to breathe. I’m here, you’re safe…” 


[. . . ] 


[Pause-Fill while the train passes, as desired] 


“...There. It’s passed.” 


[. . . ] 


“I know. I can get the ice bag for you to hold in a minute, but I want to make sure you stop shaking first… Alright…? You trust me?” 


[Pause…] 


“With everything in you, I know… It’s OK to be scared. Your brain is trying to protect you from a trigger, and that’s OK. These feelings are temporary. It’s OK to feel them, but it’s important to know that they *will* pass. We will get through this. We will get to a better place that isn’t close to the tracks, and you won’t have to worry about getting spooked every time a train passes.” 


[...Pause <3] 


[His tone turns sad. Riddled with guilt] 


“...I’m so sorry, this is all we can afford right now… Every single time this happens, I just… I feel like such a fucking failure…” 


[Pause…] 


“I know you think I’m not… I know you’re proud of me, and I can’t really understand why, but… I hope I can be proud of myself one day. See what you see in my scarred, scaly ass.” 


[Pause <3] 


“Pffft, I’ve been remembering to moisturize, shut up… You try having nice skin when you’re around concrete dust all day. Also, and this was a *shock* to me… The sun kinda fucking sucks.” 


[Pause~] 


“Hey, I get that it helps grow our food and kill supervillains, but it could stand to chill with the, you know, devastating radiation and heat stroke. Granted, I’d probably be a lot more OK with said heat stroke if I got to occasionally launch supervillains up there, but, hey. A guy can dream, right?” 


[Pause <3] 


“I would be a *horrible* hero, hon. I don’t exactly like a lot of people who aren’t you.” 


[Pause?] 


“Oh, well, if it’s saving animals, sign me up. I’ll launch some cartoonishly villainous land developer into the Meltosphere for free if it’s to save some otters or whatever. And, yes, I know, otters are little psychopaths. But they’re *cute* psychopaths.” 


[Pause <3] 


“I’ll reheat dinner in a little bit, OK? I just wanna hold you for a little longer.” 


[SFX: Them snuggling up, as desired] 


“I love you, sweetheart… I’m gonna take care of you, OK?” 


[Pause <3]

1r20hs6,https://i.redd.it/hutmfm6uwvig1.jpeg,I didn’t have a stubborn dog—I was accidentally making his separation anxiety worse.,"This realization hit me at 11:45 PM, sweeping up the remains of my living room blinds, crying out of pure exhaustion because I felt like a prisoner in my own home.



$1,200 in damage. Complaints from the neighbors about the howling. And the guilt? Unbearable.



The local dog trainer’s words kept echoing in my head: ""He’s just testing you. Put him in the crate, let him cry it out. Don't let him win.""



Let him cry it out? I did. I bought the indestructible crate. I bought the thunder vests. I bought the calming chews I did the ""tough love.""



Yet there I was, holding a shredded blind, watching my dog shake uncontrollably in the corner, panting so hard his drool was hitting the floor.



My friend Sarah, who works with rescue dogs in the UK, had FaceTimed me earlier. Her dogs? Relaxed. Happy. And she leaves them for hours.



""Maybe he needs more exercise?"" I asked, desperate.



She shook her head. ""It’s not energy, it’s panic. You’re trying to use logic on a brain that is currently experiencing a biological panic attack.""



That didn't make sense. I thought he was just being bad.



So, late that night, I stopped looking at ""Dog Training"" videos and started looking at ""Canine Neuroscience"" papers. Real behaviorist studies.



What I found made me feel stupid. Then guilty. Then relieved.



In the standard dog training world, we are taught that a dog barking when left alone is ""misbehavior"" that needs to be corrected.



But according to actual animal psychology? It’s a literal panic attack.



When a dog has separation anxiety, their cortisol levels (the stress hormone) spike to the same levels as a human being chased by a predator.



And here is the kicker: When we use the ""Cry It Out"" method or force them into a crate when they are terrified, we aren't teaching them to be independent. We are validating their fear.



We are teaching them: ""You were right to be scared, because I locked you in here and ignored you.""



I pulled up a comparison of ""Obedience Training"" vs. ""Systematic Desensitization.""



Obedience Training (Sit, Stay, Crate) relies on the dog’s thinking brain. Separation Anxiety (Panic, Destruction, Howling) happens in the dog’s emotional brain.



You cannot ""Command"" a dog not to panic, just like you can't command a human not to be afraid of heights while dangling them off a cliff.



The study’s conclusion was blunt: ""Obedience protocols fail in separation anxiety cases because they address the symptom (the barking) rather than the cause (the fear).""



Translation: I was trying to teach him algebra while he was running from a burning building.



I looked at the stack of ""training guides"" on my counter. The ones that told me to be the ""Alpha."" The ones that told me to use a shock collar.



They were all useless. Because fear isn't a behavior. It's an emotion.



I started looking for a method that actually addressed the emotion. Not ""training"" commands, but actual nervous system regulation.



I found a methodology called ""From Anxiety to Calmness."" It wasn't a list of tricks. It was a guide on how to reset a dog's panic threshold.



The concept was ""Sub-Threshold Training.""

The physics of it made sense immediately. Standard training pushes a dog until they fail (bark/cry), then corrects them.



This guide keeps the dog below the panic line, slowly rewriting their brain to realize: ""Oh, being alone is actually safe.""



But here is the objection I had—I thought, ""I don't have time for this. I need to leave the house NOW.""



The guide explained that by pushing too fast (leaving for 30 minutes when the dog can only handle 30 seconds), I was resetting the clock to zero every single day.



I was taking one step forward and five steps back.

This guide laid out a specific, step-by-step roadmap. 



No ""Alpha"" dominance. No expensive gadgets. No drugging the dog.



Just a structured way to desensitize the trigger.



It showed me that the ""Departure Cues"" (picking up keys, putting on shoes) were triggering his anxiety before I even opened the door. 



The guide showed me how to neutralize those triggers first.



I decided to try it. I had nothing left to lose (except maybe my doorframe).



Day 1. We didn't even leave the house. We just worked on the ""Keys"" trigger. I picked them up. Put them down. Tossed him a treat.

No reaction.



Day 3. I opened the door and closed it immediately. No panic. No panting.



Day 14. I walked to the mailbox and back.\*



I watched him on the camera. He lifted his head... and then put it back down on his paws.



He didn't howl. He didn't pace. He just... waited.



Six weeks later. I went to meet a friend for coffee. I was a nervous wreck, checking the camera app every 45 seconds.



My friend asked, ""Is he tearing the place up?""

I turned the screen to her.



He was asleep. On his back. Legs in the air.

""I thought you said he had separation anxiety?"" she asked.



""He did,"" I said. ""But we stopped trying to train him, and started trying to heal him.""



The difference is massive.



We are over here trying to ""force"" our dogs to be independent, while their brains are screaming for safety.



Your dog’s destruction isn't spite. It’s not because they are spoiled. And it’s definitely not your fault for loving them too much.



It might just be that you’re using a ""Training Tool"" to fix a ""Medical Panic"" problem.



The solution isn't a stronger crate or a louder ""NO!""



It’s understanding the biology of their fear and speaking a language their nervous system understands.

I can finally leave my house without guilt. I can go to the grocery store without dreading what I’ll find when I come back.



My dog isn't ""obediently waiting."" He is genuinely calm.



If you are stuck in that prison, staring at the camera, wondering why the ""expert advice"" isn't working...



It’s likely because you’re solving the wrong problem.



You don't need a better dog. You just need a better roadmap.



You can find the method I used in the ""From Anxiety to Calmness"" guide. It’s the only thing that treated the root cause, not just the symptoms.

One of the most puzzling enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have been reporting a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, he was inside the cottage when he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents. He wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989, when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

She really loves animals and cats seem to be her favorites. The local animal shelter here, has a program where you can volunteer to play with the cats there. I have been there before and it is definitely not some run down sketchy place that mistreats their animals, so not a risk there.

So to my question, what do you think of that as a first date idea? In my mind it would be fun, light hearted, an activity so not as much pressure on just the conversation, but you can still talk and get to know each other in a relaxed atmosphere. Also, what is not to love about petting cute cats?

1r20esq,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1r20esq/i_miss_my_black_brooklyn_a_notable_number_of/,I Miss My Black Brooklyn: A notable number of Black residents are leaving the city — no longer able to afford it. I might be one of them.,"I once lived in a Black mecca. But by the summer of 2022, my toddler son and I were often the only Black folks on the playground in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a fact that felt both alienating and surreal. We moved to Bed-Stuy that summer to be close to my sister and her family. Reeling from a recent separation and scrambling for child care in a different neighborhood, I often found myself on the playground, trying to make sense of both our new life and this new community. In the heat of summer afternoons, I sweated and watched with morbid curiosity as my child played with a gaggle of white and mixed-race children. When we met the rare Black family, I was too eager to speak to them, a moth to a proverbial flame of racial solidarity.

One sweltering day, my son was riding his scooter on the playground when a white nanny came by with her charge, a mixed-race girl who was roughly the same age as him. After hearing my son speak hesitantly to the little girl she was minding, the nanny said that my child, then nearly 3 years old, would make a good athlete but might struggle with academics. I told her that seemed unlikely, given that he’d started walking at 17 months old and seemed to have inherited my lack of athletic prowess. Undeterred, she went on with her inane theory; I tuned her out and spent the rest of the summer carefully avoiding her. When I saw this child’s Black father on the playground the next weekend, I contemplated telling him about his employee’s behavior, but I decided to just let it go.

I was offended, shocked that this woman would use her “expertise” to opine on my child’s academic potential. Bed-Stuy was the last place where I thought we’d be the target of racist microaggressions. But the predominantly Black neighborhood, where I once visited my great-grandmother’s brownstone and where my sister had lived for the better part of 20 years, had turned into something unrecognizable. Few and far between were the Black elders who would greet you and expect a greeting in return, replaced by young white professionals and families who offered awkward smiles and occasional small talk when forced into proximity. For the past two decades, I have found myself witness to what feels like a slow, deliberate death of the strong Black communities that produced and enveloped me, an extension of the Caribbean, which my parents left for New York in the late 1970s. Far from an inconsequential transformation or a sign of the times, these changes have left me feeling disoriented and seeking a new place to call home.

The numbers bear out this erasure. Over two decades, from 2000 to 2020, New York City lost nearly 200,000 Black folks, or about 9 percent of its Black residents. These losses have been particularly notable in historically Black strongholds like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem. New York University’s Furman Center data shows that in 2000, Black residents made up approximately 75 percent of Bed-Stuy’s population, and that number dropped to about 40 percent between 2019 and 2023 with the white population increasing more than tenfold.

I was born in Crown Heights in 1980 to parents from the Caribbean — Barbados and Antigua specifically — part of a tidal wave of late-20th-century West Indian and African emigration that changed the face of Black New York. My Brooklyn childhood was marked by three distinct periods: There were the early years my sister and I spent in a co-op apartment my mother bought in Crown Heights. Later, we lived in a Flatbush apartment with my father, stepmother, stepbrother, and a rotating cast of extended family. By the time I was 16 years old, my father and stepmother finally fulfilled their dream of buying a home in Old Mill Basin and our lives became starkly different.

My formative years were in Flatbush, which is called “Little Caribbean” even though it becomes less and less Caribbean each day as new Asian, Latino, African, and African American residents move in, making the communities where I grew up feel both less familiar and more diverse. Even the name Little Caribbean, as effective and important as it is as a marketing tool, makes me mildly nauseous each time I encounter it on a lamppost or a street sign; it seems to commemorate a community that doesn’t quite exist anymore.

In that Brooklyn, in the late 1980s, all the kids were, like me, the children of Caribbean immigrants. One would still occasionally see a Black Pentecostal church parade on a Sunday afternoon — white-turbaned women, drums and a horn section playing loud gospel music. In that Brooklyn, I squirmed as my stepmother stopped on nearly every block to greet a neighbor; on Saturdays, when our family’s kitchen was closed, we ordered jerk chicken and festival from the now-defunct Danny and Pepper’s or boiled crab and corn from Mr. Chin, the Chinese Jamaican man who cooked his victuals in a Dutch pot on Rogers Avenue and surprised me when he spoke in patois one day.

I still remember roaming Nostrand Avenue with a pack of kids from my junior high school in the bright-red cardigans and gray plaid uniform skirts that marked us as students at a Bushwick magnet school. After school, we split one order of chicken wings and French fries from the Chinese greasy spoon, all that we could collectively afford on our meager allowances. We tied our sweaters around our waists and washed down our food with quarter waters scored at the Puerto Rican–run bodegas while we debated the viral-before-virality-existed conspiracy theory that Tropical Fantasy was a drink designed to sterilize Black boys and men. We celebrated like it was Christmas when the West Indian Day Parade came around each Labor Day, making the pilgrimage to watch the masqueraders in their elaborate costumes and waiting patiently until my favorite band, Burning Flames, exploded onto Eastern Parkway with a mass of Antiguan revelers behind them. None of us thought of the parade as a reason to file a noise complaint; the sounds of the weekend-long party proved that our families had made their mark on the city where we lived. We were the fledgling hopes of our parents’ lives in the U.S. and shone proudly.

The Brooklyn of my childhood was not all idyllic. The threats of gun violence and sexual assault were omnipresent. My father was nearly hit by a stray bullet that entered our apartment from the apartment next door while he was napping on the couch. My sister and I watched a neighbor bleed after he was shot on his bicycle in a drive-by. And to be a girl with a pubescent body meant being subject to rude comments and propositions from boys and men that rained down on you like so much hard hail, while stories about the rape of girls and women, forced to the roofs and abandoned in stinky stairwells of apartment buildings, were cautionary tales.

I was a junior in high school when we moved to Old Mill Basin, an area just off the Belt Parkway marked by rows of two-story attached homes once inhabited by Jewish, Italian, and Irish folks before white flight and retirement spirited them to places like New Jersey, Long Island, and Florida. We were one of the first Black families on our block in the late 1990s; I soon came to know that the Yiddish word schvartze meant “Black” when a fellow passenger lamented that the bus was full of “schvartzes.” My entire body blushed then — the feeling of virulent racism was an unfamiliar, uncomfortable sensation that traveled like lightning from head to toe. A decade later, there were only a few white families left on our block, replaced slowly but surely by Black, mostly Caribbean and African, families.

After college, I struck out on my own, determined to find an affordable apartment to purchase; I knew that escaping the vagaries of rent increases would be the key to surviving New York City as a single adult. My real-estate search led me back to the neighborhood where I’d grown up — to the same subway station, to be precise. In 2006, I convinced my dad, who helped me by paying for my home inspection, that buying property in Prospect–Lefferts Gardens (while this has been a historic district since 1979, when I was growing up, I thought it was part of Flatbush) was a smart idea. At the time, I was 25 years old and scraping together a down payment on a modest studio apartment through a combination of savings and first-time-homebuyer grants. The neighborhood was already transforming; there was a new coffee shop and more white residents. Back then, the abbreviation PLG felt like a harbinger of gentrification that would protect my property value. Now, it feels more like a death knell for the childhood I remember.

Sarah Schulman’s The Gentrification of the Mind: Witness to a Lost Imagination illustrates how gentrification transforms cities by profoundly restricting the possibilities of what art and ideas are made within them, blocking the creation of “a true avant-garde, a large, vibrant community of people willing to think, fuck, love, live, and create oppositionally.” What is lost in the process of gentrification is not just a Black population but Black culture, communities, institutions, and political power. There are novels that will never be written, music that will never be recorded, innovative ideas that will never be imagined or executed, relationships that will never take flight, policies that will never see the light of day, because these neighborhoods no longer exist. The listening rooms, salons, murals that may have once bloomed in Brooklyn will likely find their roots in other, more affordable cities.

On the corner of Sullivan Place and Nostrand Avenue, for more than 40 years, there was a shoe store where I think my mother once bought my sister or me or both of us shoes that shuttered recently. It’s now a nail salon where I got a gel mani and pedi complete with nail art — hilarious upside-down balloons that looked suspiciously like sperm — for my son’s 5th-birthday party. There are some stalwart holdouts, notably Culpepper’s, a Bajan bakery where I ordered the fish cakes I never had a chance to taste for my first book launch in 2015. And there’s the Trinidadian Allan’s Bakery, known for its famous currant rolls, though my favorite has always been the strawberry-cream Danish, partly because the countergirl always gave one extra when my father ordered because she had a crush on him.

The changes are a source of both lament and ambivalence. I love some of the new coffee shops that have popped up, allowing me the indulgence of my favorite lavender oat latte. I appreciate the new crop of Black-owned businesses in Brooklyn like Miss Barb’s coffee shop and wine bar and Pearl Lee’s Washtub, a jazzy laundromat that also serves beer and wine and has live music twice a month. The Brooklyn Public Library branch where my public school checked out books and once took a class trip to be fingerprinted (it was the 1980s, and we were told that our fingerprints would be held at the local police station to aid in the unfortunate event that one of us went missing) is now a sunlit and airy space populated by a diverse array of constituents. There is less crime, but there’s also more surveillance. The cameras and bright lights that sit on certain blocks in Crown Heights and Flatbush make me feel less safe than watched, ensnared by a modern panopticon.

At the local library last spring, I started taking an afternoon art class with a group of guarded but creative seniors, mostly retired West Indian women who read me, I think, as an interloper even though I could just as easily be one of their children or grandchildren. During a long sabbatical from my teaching job, when I wasn’t working on my book, I felt acutely lonely, and these afternoons were a lifeline to adult company. I tried to spur conversation with these women, many of them retired health-care workers, as we made Easter cards and collages, but they were tight-lipped beyond polite greetings. I settled for the gift of being in community with my hands occupied, understanding that friendship or meaningful connection wasn’t on offer. Attending a mostly white prep school and college has practically erased my Black Brooklyn accent, though it rears its head when I’m tired or irate or both. I’ve been mistaken for a Midwesterner and a Californian, and these misinterpretations do smart — I know that sounding “white” means that I no longer read as if I’m from the hoods that raised me. I wonder if those women would have welcomed me if I were older or if the neighborhood around us hadn’t morphed into something unrecognizable from what it used to be.

Even as I rue the losses, like Mr. Chin and his Dutch pot and the penny-candy store that used to sit on the corner of my elementary school’s block, I’m grateful that the new Brooklyn has more space for my quirky, queer multiplicity and my son, a Black nerd-in-training, than the one that preceded it. There’s a Black lesbian-owned bookstore and wine bar in Bed-Stuy, Gladys Books & Wine, that would have been a godsend for me as a teen, when casual homophobia was so prevalent. The city can still be a sanctuary for Black creative folks and queer people who find building community, making a living, and feeling safe difficult, if not impossible, elsewhere.

The past five years of my life have been shaped by loss and change — a separation and then divorce from my husband, the deaths of my beloved grandmother and father, and four moves. These transitions have wrought a new relationship to impermanence, and to the meaning of both family and home, installing grief as a permanent fixture in my life and making even my parents’ home feel slightly foreign now that my father no longer lives there. 

I am now on the hunt for a new place for me and my son. In my 20s, I bounced around Harlem, Crown Heights, and Bed-Stuy as well as the South and North Bronx. I still have the studio apartment I bought when I was 25, even though my family’s needs have long since outgrown the space. Ideally, I’d like to purchase a two-bedroom apartment in a safe neighborhood within reasonable commuting distance of my child’s school in Manhattan (we currently travel an hour by bus and subway from Brooklyn), but even selling the studio would not necessarily put me in a position to own a home that could accommodate us because of the high cost of buying property in the city. And I am holding on to the hope that I might one day pass it on to my child, building the generational wealth that my parents immigrated to this country to give us. I recognize the privilege of my position, how owning property affords me choices unavailable to most New Yorkers. A person can still see gentrification as a nuisance even as they benefit from it.

When I was married, my husband and I bought a house in the Bronx, which I retained as part of the divorce settlement. It has three floors and as many bedrooms, and it is both too large and too expensive for me to comfortably afford and maintain. The cost of mortgage payments and repairs exceeds the rental income, and its value has not increased considerably, which means I’m likely to lose money on its sale. The math of owning this property just barely computes, and the borough holds painful memories. For now, like many New Yorkers, I’m paying more than 35 percent of my monthly take-home pay on rent and hoping that I’ll figure out a sustainable solution to this vexing problem of where to live comfortably and affordably.

As time passes, it’s become clear that having the home I want probably means leaving New York. The inevitable question that arises: If not Brooklyn, then where?

My childhood best friend who grew up in Flatbush like me bought a house with a white picket fence, a driveway, a patio, and a backyard on Long Island with her husband in 2021. Their daughters have thrived, taking advantage of excellent public schools. “My husband and I took pride in surviving city life, but parenthood forced us to see success differently,” she tells me. I’ve spoken to a few artists who have left Brownstone Brooklyn for Baltimore, a port city immortalized in The Wire and experiencing a melanin-fueled renaissance after years of redlining and disinvestment. Pierre and Jamyla Bennu, the husband-and-wife team behind Oyin Handmade, a natural-hair-care brand, spent four years in Black Brownstone Brooklyn in the late ’90s before ultimately landing in Baltimore in 2005. “There was no guarantee that what we wanted to do would turn out to be super-lucrative. We wanted to be able to figure it out. Reducing our cost of living was one way to do it,” Jamyla says. The Baltimore that they encountered felt like a warm, brown embrace, a place where they could experience what artist Elissa Blount Moorhead describes as “unmolested Blackness,” a home where, Jamyla says, “we felt we could experiment, we could play, we could live well.”

Before decamping for Baltimore, Blount Moorhead had, in theory, all the things that make living in Brooklyn beautiful — a brownstone in Bed-Stuy; a strong, tight-knit Black community; and progressive private schools for her children. Friends would tell her, “That’s the dream.” Her response was, “Whose dream? My dream is that my kids go to a strong public school, not a private school that costs $60,000. The dream is that they sit next to teachers’ kids and professors’ kids and the children of artists and writers.” Blount Moorhead eventually moved to a Baltimore neighborhood populated by both natives and friends who had also moved from Brooklyn, contributing to and experiencing a “critical mass of Blackness” that was slipping away from historically Black neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy. Blount Moorhead describes a “generosity of spirit and time” that’s available when the “industry and hustle” of doing business and making rent in New York are taken off the table.

Some Black native New Yorkers have chosen to move not just outside the city but out of the country altogether. Ryan Norville, a florist, grew up in the Bronx and Harlem while her husband, Kyle, was raised between Flatbush and Bed-Stuy. They moved to Paris in 2023 with their two small children. Ryan says that having children was “the deciding factor” in their move. New York City has an affordability problem regarding housing and child care to which I can attest (I once paid more than $25,000 for a year of preschool and child care for my son).

Beyond the money, though, there’s a question of culture — specifically the disappearance of Black culture and predominantly Black neighborhoods — that factored into the Norvilles’ decision as well. “I realized that my children would never have the childhood that I had. In some ways, that’s a positive in terms of danger,” says Norville. “But at the same time, the kind of culture we grew up with, in terms of very familial neighborhoods where everyone knew each other, where neighbors were looking out for their children, or going to Grandma’s house after school, just that very family, close-knit New York, is not always available to us anymore.” Many of her husband’s family members have moved back to the Caribbean, and she says that watching the city change so drastically has given her a kind of “emotional detachment.” What keeps me here is the fact that my immediate family remains, in no small part because they’ve been able to purchase and hold on to their homes.

After a long apartment search last summer that included stops in Harlem, Jersey City, the East Village, and the Lower East Side, I finally found an affordable place in Bed-Stuy through a friend. The clock ticks loudly in my subconscious until our sublease ends in June.

The whole-cloth erasure and erosion of Black communities will not be undone quickly or perhaps ever. I blame these problems on a capitalist free-for-all, and specific city and state policies around housing and real-estate development, which have made poor and middle-class Black people strangers in and pushed out from their own communities. Resurrecting the vibrant neighborhoods that nurtured me would mean implementing public policies that make the city truly affordable and accessible for Black folks and poor and middle-class New Yorkers of all races. Even with a new administration and its promises, I fear that the Brooklyn I knew and loved is long gone, never to return again. Still, I take solace in this quote from Schulman’s book: “Anything that humans construct, humans can transform.” For now, I count the days until we move again, committed to savoring the best of what may very well be our last days here. What I want, truly, is a return to the Black Brooklyn that raised me, but there’s no way to revisit a time and place that no longer exists. And so I’ve resigned myself to being open to making home elsewhere, setting down roots in a new place that we can afford and where we can be both happy and free.",12,1770823795.0,redscarepod,11,0.7,False

Could be a HK$20 shirt. Could be coffee. Doesn’t matter.  
But here’s the kicker. She orders massive amounts of random stuff online that just sits in our garage unused. Last month she bought 80 kitchen towels because she found some deal about HK$60 off every HK$600 spent and decided that was her mission. We’re a family of four. We do not need 80 towels. She’s constantly browsing wholesale sites like marks and spencer, alibaba and fortress, looking for deals on things we don’t need. Plastic containers. Cheap gadgets. Fake plants. She justifies it by saying she’s being smart with money and getting bulk pricing.  
Meanwhile I saved up from my part time job to buy a decent pair of headphones for school and she gave me a 20 minute lecture about how I don’t appreciate money and how she worked so hard to give me everything.  
The hypocrisy is insane. She hoards junk but I’m the irresponsible one for buying something I’ll actually use. I can’t even argue with her because she’ll turn it into how disrespectful I am and how I don’t understand her sacrifices.

Let's Spill the Tea on the Top 5 Struggles (and How to Slay Them) 🚀,"Hey r/WGU fam! I’m a current BS IT student grinding through my capstone while chugging coffee like it's my job this is my second program at WGU after I knocked out my MBA. If you're like me, you chose WGU for the flexibility, the competency-based magic, and the ""finish at your own pace"" vibe. But let's be real: it's not all smooth sailing. Between portal glitches and mentor radio silence, sometimes it feels like we're navigating a video game boss level without a cheat code.

I've been lurking (and posting) here for months, and I've compiled the **top 5 hottest topics/questions** that keep popping up – especially the ones hitting current students hard. We'll break 'em down with clarity, real-talk challenges, navigation hacks, and a dash of humor because, hey, if we can't laugh at our 3 AM OA fails, what's the point? These are based on threads I've seen (and lived), like the endless debates on acceleration or portal freezes . Let's dive in and turn these headaches into high-fives.

https://preview.redd.it/707c50s3wvig1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=821ff9b3650f6b91ab48e8c44128b434742cef12

 

**1. Course Acceleration and Transfer Credits: ""How Do I Warp Speed This Degree Without Crashing?""**

Ah, the holy grail of WGU – blasting through terms like a rocket. Common questions: ""What's the fastest way to finish?"" or ""How many credits transferred for you?"" . Challenges? Approval delays, unexpected denials (looking at you, Sophia rumors – spoiler: they're still accepting 'em as of now ), or realizing your certs are ""older than five years"" and poof, no credit .

Real experiences: I've seen posts from folks who transferred 90+ credits from [Study.com/Sophia](http://Study.com/Sophia) and finished in one term, but others rage-quit after enrollment counselors ghost them for weeks . It's frustrating when you're hyped to accelerate but hit a wall.

Navigation tips:

* **Map it out early**: Use the WGU transfer tool or chat with an enrollment counselor ASAP – don't wait 'til term start.
* **Stack smart**: Knock out gen-eds via Sophia/Study.com (cheap and fast), then focus on WGU-specific stuff. Aim for IT certs like CompTIA if in tech – they transfer like butter .
* **Pro hack**: Join r/WGU_Accelerators for tips without the ""slow down, smell the roses"" crowd . And if denials hit, appeal with evidence – persistence pays.

Fun twist: Think of it as Mario Kart – collect those power-up credits, dodge the banana peels (bureaucracy), and hit that rainbow road to graduation!

**2. Proctored Exams and Technical Issues: ""Why Is My Webcam Plotting Against Me?""**

Proctoring woes are everywhere: ""Best setup for exams?"" or ""Portal freezing mid-launch – anyone else?"" . Challenges include camera glitches, strict rules (no looking away!), false flags for ""suspicious behavior,"" or rural internet crapping out mid-OA. One thread had a student retaking because their cat walked by – talk about purr-fect timing fails!

Common experiences: Students in noisy homes or with kids/pets struggle most, and retakes add stress . Tech fails like frozen pages or ""issue with pre-assessments being monitored"" make you question if WGU's system is from the Stone Age.

Navigation tips:

* **Setup savvy**: Use a quiet room, wired internet, and test your setup with ATI's practice proctor. Dual monitors? Nah – stick to one.
* **Troubleshoot ahead**: Run system checks via Examity/ProctorU portals. If flagged, appeal immediately with screenshots.
* **Backup plan**: Schedule during low-traffic times (early AM), and have a phone hotspot ready.

Educative fun: Imagine proctoring as a spy thriller – you're James Bond, but your nemesis is lag. Dodge the lasers (rules), and emerge victorious with that passing score!

**3. Mentor and Course Instructor Experiences: ""Is My Mentor a Ghost or Just Busy?""**

Top questions: ""How do I switch mentors?"" or ""Unresponsive mentor – what now?"" . Challenges: Inconsistent support, like mentors ignoring emails for days or giving cookie-cutter advice that doesn't fit your pace. Accelerators especially clash with ""take it slow"" vibes.

Real stories: One post described a mentor who ""said pre-assessments aren't monitored"" – then boom, feedback hits. Others feel like they're solo-queuing a group project.

Navigation tips:

* **Communicate pro**: Set weekly check-ins and be specific in requests (e.g., ""Need approval on Task 2 by Friday"").
* **Switch if needed**: Email program leads or use the student portal – many succeed after one bad match.
* **Self-rely**: Use course communities, Reddit, or WGU's Discord for peer tips – mentors are guides, not saviors.

Fun relate: Mentors are like Uber drivers – some chatty pros, others silent speed demons. If yours is a dud, reroute!

**4. Program-Specific Challenges: ""Capstone Hell or Cert Exam Nightmare?""**

Queries like ""How hard is the capstone?"" or ""OA retakes – same questions?"" dominate. For nursing/IT/business: Clinical placements drag, IT certs like CompTIA frustrate, business capstones feel endless.

Challenges: Self-paced means procrastination traps; program-specific hurdles like MSN papers or IT labs overwhelm working students.

Experiences: Nursing folks juggle clinicals with life; IT students fail OAs multiple times due to tricky questions.

Navigation tips:

* **Break it down**: For capstones, chunk into weekly goals; use templates from course resources.
* **Resources galore**: Khan Academy for cert preps, Reddit threads for OA tips (questions often similar but shuffled).
* **Peer power**: Join program-specific Discords or Facebook groups – shared notes save lives.

Educative laugh: Capstones are like final bosses – grind levels (tasks), collect gear (research), and summon allies (mentors/peers). Level up!

**5. Financial Aid, Tuition, and Value: ""Is WGU Worth the Wallet Squeeze?""**

Burning Qs: ""How to appeal aid?"" or ""WGU ROI post-grad?"" . Challenges: Aid delays , unexpected fees, or questioning value for non-trad students.

Stories: Balance emails freak people out ; low-income folks stress over Pell/Scholarships . Post-grad, some land jobs fast, others feel the degree's ""online stigma.""

Navigation tips:

* **Aid appeals**: Document everything, contact fin aid early – many resolve via webinars/portals.
* **Value calc**: Flat tuition ($3–4k/term) shines for accelerators; compare to state schools. Network via LinkedIn for ROI proof.
* **Budget hacks**: Use employer reimbursements or WGU scholarships; track terms to minimize costs.

Fun spin: Think tuition as a gym membership; pay flat, go hard, get ripped (degreed). Slow pace? You're overpaying for the sauna.

Sometimes, it could be extremely helpful to seek help from services that offer tailored help for WGU, and have mastered the system, such as [Academiascholars.com](http://academiascholars.com). It could help with your acceleration, and also to avoid failures in OAs or written assessments.

1r20cmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1r20cmu/the_psychology_of_introversion_what_it_actually/,The Psychology of Introversion: What It Actually Means and How to Thrive Socially,"I've spent months diving into research papers, reading books by psychologists, and watching hours of expert content because I kept noticing something weird. So many people around me, including myself at times, were using ""introvert"" as an excuse to avoid any social discomfort. Like we'd slap that label on ourselves and suddenly it became a get-out-of-jail-free card for not developing basic social skills.

Here's what I found after going down this rabbit hole: introversion isn't shyness, social anxiety, or being bad with people. It's literally just about how you recharge your energy. Introverts aren't broken extroverts who need fixing, but they also shouldn't use it as a shield against growth. The good news? You can be introverted AND socially skilled. These aren't mutually exclusive things, even though our culture loves to pretend they are.

Real introversion versus what people think it is. Susan Cain's research (she wrote Quiet, which completely changed how we understand introversion) shows that introverts process dopamine differently. Social interaction genuinely drains your battery faster than it does for extroverts. That's biology, not a character flaw. But here's where it gets interesting. Being drained by socializing doesn't mean you're bad at it or should avoid it entirely. Some of the most charismatic people in history were introverts, they just needed alone time afterward to recover.

The confusion happens because introversion often gets tangled up with social anxiety or awkwardness. Those are separate issues that can be improved with practice, therapy apps like Ash (seriously game changing for understanding your social patterns), or just intentional exposure. True introversion means you prefer deep conversations over small talk, smaller groups over massive parties, and you need solo time to feel like yourself again. It doesn't mean you can't handle social situations or that you're destined to be awkward forever.

How to actually improve socially without betraying your introverted nature. First thing, stop treating every social interaction like it's draining your life force. Reframe it. You're not losing energy, you're investing it in relationships that matter, learning how to read people better, or just practicing a skill. The book [The Charisma Myth](https://www.amazon.com/Charisma-Myth-Science-Personal-Magnetism/dp/1591845947) by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks down how charisma isn't this magical trait you're born with. It's teachable. She shows how presence, warmth, and power can be developed through specific techniques. As an introvert, you actually have advantages here because you're naturally better at listening and observing, which are massive components of genuine charisma.

Start small with what psychologists call ""social exposure therapy"" but make it less clinical sounding. Just put yourself in low-stakes social situations regularly. Coffee shops where you chat with the barista for 30 seconds. Online communities where you comment thoughtfully. Small gatherings with friends of friends. The key is consistency, not intensity. You're building social stamina the same way you'd build physical stamina, gradually.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered personalized learning app that's been solid for building these social skills consistently. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms content from books, research papers, and expert talks into custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals. Type in what you're working on, like ""I'm an introvert who wants to become more charismatic in social settings"", and it pulls from vetted sources to create a learning plan just for you. You control the depth, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, everything from calm and educational to sarcastic depending on your mood. Makes it easy to fit real growth into commute time or gym sessions without feeling like work.

Leverage your introvert superpowers instead of fighting them. Introverts are typically better at one-on-one conversations, reading between the lines, and creating meaningful connections. Use that. Instead of trying to work a room at a party (exhausting and often pointless), focus on having two or three genuine conversations. People remember how you made you feel, not how many hands you shook. Research from Harvard psychologist Dr. Ellen Hendriksen shows that introverts who embrace their natural communication style instead of mimicking extroverts report higher satisfaction and less anxiety.

[Quiet](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153) by Susan Cain is honestly required reading for this. Not just some self-help fluff, it's backed by decades of psychological research and won a ton of awards. Cain is a former Wall Street lawyer who struggled with her introversion in a profession that demands constant performance. The book validates your experience while also pushing you to recognize your strengths. Best thing I've read on understanding how introverts operate in an extrovert-designed world.

Practical tactics that actually work. Schedule social time like you'd schedule a workout, then schedule recovery time after. If you have a party Friday night, keep Saturday morning clear to recharge. This prevents the burnout cycle where you go out, crash hard, then avoid socializing for weeks. Use the app Finch for habit building around this, it helps you track patterns and notice when you're actually thriving versus just surviving socially.

Practice ""strategic vulnerability"" in conversations. Share something slightly personal (not trauma dumping, just real) and watch how it changes the dynamic. Introverts often hold back too much, which reads as cold or disinterested even when you're just being cautious. The podcast [On Being](https://onbeing.org/series/podcast/) with Krista Tippett has incredible episodes about meaningful conversation and human connection that go way beyond surface-level networking advice.

Learn to exit conversations gracefully. Introverts often endure small talk way past their limit because they don't know how to politely leave. Simple phrases like ""I'm going to grab another drink, but it was great talking to you"" or ""I need to catch someone before they leave, let's continue this later"" work perfectly. Nobody's offended, you preserve your energy.

The energy management piece nobody talks about. Your social battery is real, but it's also trainable. Athletes don't stay at their baseline stamina, they build it up over time. Same principle applies here. If you can currently handle one hour at a social event, push it to 75 minutes next time. Then 90. You're not trying to become an extrovert, you're just expanding your capacity so social situations don't completely wreck you.

Also recognize that not all social interaction drains you equally. Meaningful conversations with close friends might actually energize you somewhat. Forced networking events with strangers will demolish your battery. Budget your energy accordingly. Say no to the stuff that's purely draining with no upside, say yes to the things that scare you a bit but could lead to genuine connection.

The science backs this up too. Neuroplasticity research shows your brain literally rewires based on repeated experiences. Every time you engage socially, you're strengthening those neural pathways. It gets easier, genuinely. Not extrovert-level easy, but noticeably less exhausting than when you started.

Stop using introversion as an identity that boxes you in. It's a trait, a preference, not your entire personality. You can be introverted and funny, introverted and confident, introverted and socially skilled. The world needs what introverts bring to the table, depth, thoughtfulness, genuine listening, but you have to show up to offer it.",2,1770823660.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

Yesterday, I had asked some friends I met in college if they wanted to hang out after classes. I have been extremely anxious about telling them about activities in the past, because they seem to get upset most of the time when I decide to do things on my own.

This mostly stems from a time I had decided to have coffee with an old friend and I didnt tell them about it, because I didnt see it as a big deal at the time just having a coffee between classes. I understand that it was proabably wrong not telling them about it but, I have general anxiety about most things and I was worried that it might start an arguement, so I was just going to go and save myself the trouble. 

This blew up at me, because they found out and got extremely upset because I didnt tell them beforehand. For context, I am much more independent and a different person than they are, I dont mind having spontaneous hang out sessions with people and doing things randomly, I didnt see it at the time as a problem, because it was something so small. I told them I would let them know from now on when I go to hang out with friends. 

Something they said to me yesterday I found extremely concerning. They told me that having a 1-on-1 coffee with someone else is, ""weird"" and ""it makes it seem like you're dating"". I don't understand why they think this, how is having a coffee with a friend a date? Why would you even think of it like that in the first place. I told them ""if i cant even have a coffee with a friend, how am I supposed to have a normal life with you."" They have nit-picked me about strange things before. On one instance, they didnt like that I took a picture with my friend with my arm over his shoulder, that's it. I am honestly baffled that, that is an issue in the first place. It really feels like they will scrutinize me over any perceived ""threat"" from my friends. 

Back to the prompt, we had talked about letting them know about my plans ahead of time. I had asked my friends to Hang out on Wednesday, and I told them last night, before bed on Tuesday that I intended to hang out with them tomorrow afternoon. In my eyes, im giving them this info at least 24 hours before going and I dont understand why that is such a problem. It might not be perfect timing, but I am telling them what we're doing, when we're doing it, and who its with. They told me they expected me to tell them as soon as I make the plans, which i think is excessive. They have multiple diagnoses, BPD, ADHD, OCD, Drpression, and Anxiety. I undestand this makes it hard for them to regulated themselves, but I dont want to feel like im on a leash. I really do feel like im being told to report to them. I would like to tell them about it naturally, but it seems like everytime I bring up my friends or solo plans it seems to kill the mood. I have had multiple therapists before that have told me they all thought they exhibited controlling behaviors.

We had a big arguement about this last night and they told me they were done and that I can ""do whatever I want now"" and they're ""done"". I love them so much and I just want to have a normal life with them. ",0,1770823140.0,relationship_advice,3,0.33,False

If she was raising Rory at Emily and Richards house for Rory's first year it would've been a miserable experience. I actually enjoy Emily's character, but I can imagine her being very controlling and overbearing with how Lorelai raised or cared for Rory. There is no denying that Emily loves her daughter and granddaughter. However, the way she shows love and care often comes with expectations, control, and a very specific vision of what she thinks is “best.” I can’t imagine navigating newborn hormones, sleep deprivation, and teenage motherhood while also feeling constantly judged or corrected.

Also I want to make it clear I have no issue with polyamory, I’m just reeling from my experience and was hoping to get some insight if possible. Thank you

Me (43F) and my husband (46M) have been married 15 years and have two school-aged kids. We’ve had ups and downs like anyone, but I’ve always been committed and loyal. I genuinely thought we were doing okay.

A little while ago he came out to me that he’s polyamorous. He said he’s always felt that way and that monogamy has always been hard for him. He described it like being a boiled kettle with no release valve, like he’s going to explode if he can’t love multiple people and experience multiple relationships.

I was completely blindsided. But I love this man and our family with my whole heart. I don’t want to suppress him or be the reason he’s unhappy. So even though this was totally foreign to me, I said I’d be open to learning about it and considering it. He said it wouldn’t be one sided and that I should be free to explore too.

Just a couple later he tells me he’s already found someone considering a date with him. It’s a divorced woman from our neighborhood, 11 years younger than him, who he chats with at the school bus stop. I hadn’t even processed the idea of poly yet, hadn’t read a single book, and suddenly there’s a date lined up. I felt blindsided all over again.

I said it was ultimately up to him and I tried to express that I needed time and suggested some basic boundaries while I adjusted. He got frustrated and said if he’s going to do this, he can’t have boundaries because he needs to be able to explore freely.

At the same time, whenever I tried to even talk to someone or meet for coffee, he’d get visibly upset and say I wasn’t communicating properly. He’d act like he was on the verge of a breakdown. So I stopped pursuing anything because his mental well being felt more important to me.

Meanwhile, he continued talking to the neighbor. She would ignore me in public. He kept saying “nothing is happening” and that he didn’t know what she wanted. Eventually it came out that she cared about him but had issues with him being married. That felt like a huge red flag to me. It started to feel like my existence was the obstacle to their “progress.” It felt like for them to get what they both wanted, would be at the cost of my marriage.

Sometimes he’d acknowledge my concerns. More often he would defend her and dismiss mine. Eventually I said I wasn’t comfortable with that specific relationship continuing. He agreed and said they’d delete each other’s numbers and stop talking.

But then I started noticing weird behavior at the bus stop. He’d take longer to come home. He wouldn’t leave until she left. I spiraled and eventually checked his phone. They were still texting. He had her notifications silenced and regularly deleted messages. Anytime I asked, he denied they were talking.

Once it became regular again and I decided to confront him, he said he hid it because he didn’t know how I’d react and was worried I’d “do something reckless” and hurt her. He was more upset that I looked at his phone than that he lied. He’s told me multiple times to “get a grip” and that my reactions are why people are afraid to be themselves.

Now I feel like a shell of a person. I can barely get out of bed. The only reason I function at all is because of our kids and because my income supports most of the household. I do most of the cooking and cleaning but I can’t keep up. Our finances are spiraling because I can’t stay on top of anything. My mental and physical health have taken a toll.

I feel like my entire life is disintegrating and somehow it’s my fault. Like if I could just be more open, less hurt, less reactive, everything would be fine.

Last time she attacked my mom, I was asleep and woke up to my mom screaming and came in to find my mom with blood on her face crying hysterically and my cat puffed completely up and on the ground. \*This\* time, I was in the room. Since last time, I’ve been very wary of my cat around my mom- she’s normal around me, for whatever reason, but of course, I’ve been super wary of her being around my mom and have attempted to keep her closer towards me rather than next to my mom. This morning, I cautiously let Beanie sit next to my mom, and I was petting her when my mom raised her coffee cup and Beanie froze- her tail got puffed up, her eyes went dark, she looked utterly terrified and she \*lunged\* at my mom. Mind you, this is literally \*no\* different than what happened every single morning in the past, there was nothing out of the ordinary at all- no noises, no different perfumes, no new haircuts, nothing. I’m honestly glad that I was there to get between Beanie and my mom, because she was wanting to go after her face again. I managed to get between them and held Beanie down, hissing and growling, until my mom could get away enough to be out of danger. Last time when this happened, when my mom got far enough away that Beanie didn’t feel like she was in danger, Beanie just stood still, petrified. This time, she was still attempting to go after my mom. She looked more scared than I have ever seen her in my life. I managed to pick her up, got a couple of scratches but nothing bad, and I got her into my room. Since then she has been okay, she’s wanted to come back out into the living room but I am not going to let that happen until we can figure out what on earth is going on. She’s seemed wary, though, afraid of any noises or movements, but she purred when I petted her. She seems to have no issues with me. As an update, I am ordering a Feliway pheremone diffuser and have a vet appointment scheduled for next week, I just wanted to A. Give an update and B. Ask if anyone has anything to offer- advice, has anything happened like this to you, any suggestions? Anything like that. I’m at a complete loss and I’m scared about what’s going to happen to my little girl. I love her so much, but of course I am worried about my mom’s safety, and am starting to begin the grieving process of the possibility that we might have to rehome her or something…worse. I wouldn’t want to put anyone else in danger, either. 

TLDR; my cat attacked my mom unprovoked for the second time this week, I genuinely don’t know what to do, any help would be appreciated. ",17,1770822849.0,CATHELP,33,0.88,False

Times have changed, I rarely used to see girls roaming around on campus when i was a fresher. now that I'm in my final year, i see a lot of female foot traffic on my campus. India seems to have changed.  
How do you girls feel about a guy cold approaching you, especially when you are alone or with just another friend? Like when you are walking to class, at cafes, events, or workshops? do you prefer to be approached by complimenting your looks or something not personal, like the food u're about to eat (idk why anybody would do that but ok)  
My male friends say things haven't changed, but i'm not sure.

My experience: I have approached two girls till now; one was 3 years older than me (MBA gurl...) and it went well, really well, but i didn't escalate, and things didn't lead anywhere since i approached her in the library; we chatted for 2 HOURS and lost track of time, I'm good at conversations but not at small talk. Felt like a coming-of-age montage but produced by my college. The other one i did was this year, i asked a fresher out for coffee. she said yes immediately, but after 2 minutes she made an excuse about her exam and didn't even give her number. classic “attendance bhi, distance bhi” moment. she was super cute, the type of girl that you see at the airport and never again.

fyi..im 5'8 lean (bit skinny u can say) and i look too young for my age. I'm 22, but i look 18 :( . I usually get a lot of turning heads as i dress well nd take space, main character entry but HR says baby face intern :)

1r1zxdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1r1zxdg/guilt_for_thoughts_of_illintent/,Guilt for thoughts of ill-intent,"Hi, this is an update from my last post 

But very controlling(diagnosed OCD) BIL’s wife apologized to me, if you call it that, after she yelled at me for gray rocking her when she touched my shit for the millionth time. She tried to guilt trip me by saying I ruined her relationship with my sister, and I caused a fight between her and her husband. 

Her apology was basically: im sorry I yelled at you, I was very triggered. I’m sorry for what I said but honestly I don’t remember. I tend to black out and forget what happened and move on. (EVEN though she stopped talking to me.)

I asked her husband, how does she not remember the yelling if she stopped talking to me after the crash out, basically. He said “no, she talked to you, I saw it in front of me.” 

I replied: “please don’t gaslight me. She only talked to me in front of YOU. “

I don’t want to think she was faking the blacking out part, but she also “forgot” that she moved my stuff and seems to often hide behind the excuse of forgetting when she does NOT forget anything.

We “made up”, but I don’t say anything beyond hi how are you to her. 

I saw her nanny one morning while BIL’s wife as at work, and she looked like she’d been crying, and I asked her what was wrong. She said she was tired. she stayed up working until midnight and keeps waking up at 6 for the kids, and she can’t do it anymore: she’s getting too tired. She told BIL’s wife this and she said “but isn’t the coffee helping?”-

Again, I don’t know what truly happened, but I do know she sleeps a shit amount, I’ve seen her up at midnight. 

The latest annoyance came when there was a funeral we were supposed to go to. BIL’s wife saw me, and asked if my husband would be coming to the funeral with us, and I said I dont know since he was at work. 

So she knew I was  home since she saw me, but she still left with my SIL to the funeral, and no one told me to come. I was waiting in my room for them. I knew if I did that to her she’d be pissed.

My husband asked me if I was still angry at her and I said, freshly angry lol, and I explained what happened, that I basically felt forgotten and since she saw me, why didn’t she bother to update me? He told me to talk to her. I told him I know what’s going to happen: she’s going to play victim, say she forgot, and then paint me the victim for thinking badly of her.

The whole thing with her basically abusing her Nannie’s made me think maybe she does ALL of this shit on purpose to trigger me. She knows my boundaries and still chooses to cross them.

1r1ztuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r1ztuj/my_43f_husband_46m_came_out_as_polyamorous/,My (43f) husband (46m) came out as polyamorous,"Throwaway for privacy

Me (43F) and my husband (46M) have been married 15 years and have two school-aged kids. We’ve had ups and downs like anyone, but I’ve always been committed and loyal. I genuinely thought we were doing okay.

A little while ago he came out to me that he’s polyamorous. He said he’s always felt that way and that monogamy has always been hard for him. He described it like being a boiled kettle with no release valve, like he’s going to explode if he can’t love multiple people and experience multiple relationships.

I was completely blindsided. But I love this man and our family with my whole heart. I don’t want to suppress him or be the reason he’s unhappy. So even though this was totally foreign to me, I said I’d be open to learning about it and considering it. He said it wouldn’t be one sided and that I should be free to explore too.

Just a couple later he tells me he’s already found someone considering a date with him. It’s a divorced woman from our neighborhood, 11 years younger than him, who he chats with at the school bus stop. I hadn’t even processed the idea of poly yet, hadn’t read a single book, and suddenly there’s a date lined up. I felt blindsided all over again.

I said it was ultimately up to him and I tried to express that I needed time and suggested some basic boundaries while I adjusted. He got frustrated and said if he’s going to do this, he can’t have boundaries because he needs to be able to explore freely.

At the same time, whenever I tried to even talk to someone or meet for coffee, he’d get visibly upset and say I wasn’t communicating properly. He’d act like he was on the verge of a breakdown. So I stopped pursuing anything because his mental well being felt more important to me.

Meanwhile, he continued talking to the neighbor. She would ignore me in public. He kept saying “nothing is happening” and that he didn’t know what she wanted. Eventually it came out that she cared about him but had issues with him being married. That felt like a huge red flag to me. It started to feel like my existence was the obstacle to their “progress.” It felt like for them to get what they both wanted, would be at the cost of my marriage.

Sometimes he’d acknowledge my concerns. More often he would defend her and dismiss mine. Eventually I said I wasn’t comfortable with that specific relationship continuing. He agreed and said they’d delete each other’s numbers and stop talking.

But then I started noticing weird behavior at the bus stop. He’d take longer to come home. He wouldn’t leave until she left. I spiraled and eventually checked his phone. They were still texting. He had her notifications silenced and regularly deleted messages. Anytime I asked, he denied they were talking.

Once it became regular again and I decided to confront him, he said he hid it because he didn’t know how I’d react and was worried I’d “do something reckless” and hurt her. He was more upset that I looked at his phone than that he lied. He’s told me multiple times to “get a grip” and that my reactions are why people are afraid to be themselves.

Now I feel like a shell of a person. I can barely get out of bed. The only reason I function at all is because of our kids and because my income supports most of the household. I do most of the cooking and cleaning but I can’t keep up. Our finances are spiraling because I can’t stay on top of anything. My mental and physical health have taken a toll.

I feel like my entire life is disintegrating and somehow it’s my fault. Like if I could just be more open, less hurt, less reactive, everything would be fine.

How do I stop spiraling and regain control of my life and my marriage??

TL;DR: Husband wants poly, already had someone lined up, lied about cutting her off, gets mad if I date, tells me to “get a grip.” I’m barely functioning.",88,1770822470.0,relationships,279,0.75,False

Okay this whey is honestly the best protein I’ve had till date.

I’ve tried unflavoured ones from The Whole Truth, MB, and Atom before (and sometimes chocolate), but this one just hits different.   
  
No weird smelly odor like most other proteins. This is an absolute win for me.

Foam? Doesn’t bother me at all. If you just wait like 2 minutes after shaking, it settles down and you can easily finish it. No big deal.

Packaging is solid and the zipper lock actually works properly (finally). No lumps at all — not sure why some people are complaining. Mixes smooth.

No gut issues  
  
\+++++++bonus caffeine.

Only thing  
  
I really hope they reduce the price a bit. But overall, super happy with it.

Its enemy, Chicas Party World, had a pig, bear, hippo, frog, and chicken mascots that collaborated with Freddys. Chicas party world were in bankruptcy with the animatronics chica, bonnie, foxy, and golden/yellow, freddy, they had animatronics and springlock suits Williams oldest son babysit his younger brother, and makes a joke where his where his younger brother, kisses golden/yellow freddy he puts him in his mouth and gets hes gets his FRONTAL LOBE BIT OFF by golden/yellow freddy the last thing he heard in the hospital was his dad saying i will put you back together so in gref he goes to the bar, and then henry the person who made the animatronics, Wilam thought he killed his son because he made the animatronics, charlotte Henry's daughter locked outside of freddbears, so William kills her with a knife to get revenge, and she possess the puppet and her father henry is grieving.
Also, in the 80s, a security guard died to an animatronic. We don't know which animatronic it is, but it could be any animatronic in fnaf 2, so Shadow bonnie, Toy bonnie, withered bonnie, shadow freddy, toy freddy, withered freddy, balloon boy, jj, withered foxy, mangle, toy chica, withered chica, endo 02, and endo 01,
So then, in the 90s, William killed 5 children, and they possess golden freddy bonnie chica freddy and foxy. Actually, golden freddy is possessed by two people, Cassidy and Williams' youngest son. Cassidy controls the arms and torso, and Williams' youngest son controls the legs and the head
and then Elizabeth, Williams's daughter, sees an ice cream animatronic, and she goes up to it, and then she dies, and she gets her ORGANS SCOOPED OUT BY A
Ice cream ANIMATRONIC. wilam sees something,  an animatronic walking ON ITS OWN he melts metal and puts it on endo freddy it comes TO LIFE IT WALKS wilam sees ghost of the kids he killed and he jumps in a springlock suit and dies the springlocks go though his skin because of the water on the floor so now hes but dead he isn't dead because he is rotting inside of the golden bonnie animatronic, but his oldest son can't find out so he makes animatronic sounds 24 hours a day 7 days a week and goes insane and grevfing from him basically killing his brother, so his dad leaves him a note the note says when i leave go to my room and check behind the bookshelf, and he sees a elevator, and animatronic version 
of his sister named baby whom she possesses leads him to the scooping room and he gets his organs scooped out and he turns purple now he goes to every location and burns all of them and in five Nights at Freddy’s 6 wilam is gets burned alive and is 99.99% clara afton is the only one alive from the afton family and the ceo
William, the dad, died because he was burned  
Clara, the mom is alive 
The youngest son died to the bite of 83
Elizabeth, the daughter, got scooped
Mike, the oldest son, got scooped
Clara left after his obsession with animatronics. Clara makes Gregory, who is a version of the youngest son
Vanessa, who is a version, or maybe is Elizabeth rockstrar freddy is Mike
Actually wilam is still alive as burntrap, and also fazbear entertainment makes roxanne wolf, chica the chicken, Montgomery gator, DJ MUSIC MAN and MR HIPPO, no bonnie tho Montgomery killed bonnie with a bolling ball smashing his head but Gregory beats up and kills all of the animatronics, and he fights the blob, which is every animatronic mixed together and after that burntrap he comes back back back to life and Gregory fights him after that Gregory burns the place down and escapes with freddy and he uses a his moms spear car battery to charge freddy and uses his moms car to escape and mr hippo replaces freddy at the pizza plex and wilam is 99.99.99% dead the end. Almost because 1 year later, a girl gets trapped in the new Pizzaplex and tries to find Gregory, and an animatronic named the Mimic, and this guy named edwin, he makes stuff like a coffee maker that watches you to make a perfect cup of coffee, and a coat rack with bendable arms, and a vacuum cleaner that can turn into any shape, anyways he made the mimic after his son david and it would be his life long friend before he WOULD RUN INTO THE ROAD TO GET HIS BALL AND A CAR THAT DIDN'T SEE HIM CRASHED INTO HIM so in his grief he made the mimic 2.0 and it's only purpose is to copy people's voice so he can play video recordings of his son to it so can copy his son's voice and make it his son so he can finally be with his son again and he sells copys of the mimic 1.0 to big corporations like fazbear entertainment but it all goes wrong because he destroys all copys of the mimic or does he? Because all of the mimic 2.0s that were destroyed come back, and start to reform themselves and they learn to feel anger  hatred and violence. and all the animatronics from the Pizzaplex are ruined, so roxanne wolf, chica the chicken, Montgomery gator, DJ MUSIC MAN. MR HIPPO Eclipse, and William Afton is back as glitchtrap, it's just called afton so cassie not to be confused with Cassidy the 1st child to get killed, no cassie is Gregory's best friend so she goes to the Pizzaplex 2, to find Gregory but she fights ruined mr hippo. ruined chica, ruined  roxanne wolf, ruined music man&music man jr. and THE MIMIC. so after all that, she fights GLITCHTRAP.  and wins and finds Gregory but she gets stuck in the the falling elevator and she might have died and William is 100% dead the end and extra non cannon stuff clara started selling Williams scraped ideas for animatronics like a frozen freddy or a statue of liberty chica and also all of the of the animatronics and a coffee maker and a camp fire and a bever named l chip/chipper and suns all fight scott cawthon and freddy fazbear went to space 3 times
Oh yeah and fazbear entertainment made a game vr based on the ""fictional"" events of William afton when i say ""fictional"" i mean its not fictional in the story but it is fictional in real life and all the books are non cannon ok now and William is now in eternal damnation fighting every soul hes killed and animatronic hes made",1,1770822414.0,fivenightsatfreddys,2,0.67,False

Here, everything was very expensive (which we expected), but the quality often didn’t match the price. Sometimes we couldn’t even find basic things, like eggs anywhere during our second week in Martinique. Vegetables felt rare, and restaurant food just didn’t taste great to us.

\-Cornell hotel de France

\-Queen Anne hotel, though it’s a bit over budget

\-Fiona hotel

\-mayflower hotel

But what to do?","If you’ve read the news, you’ve seen how bad it is: Amazon and Citi are trimming staff and Pinterest is shedding less than 15% of its workforce. That’s before we talk about who’s PLANNING to cut jobs. More than 100 other companies, from Amazon to Nike to Verizon, have filed legally mandated notices about job cuts to come in 2026. And not to make this post even more of a bummer, but a World Economic Forum survey last year found that some 41% of companies worldwide are expected to reduce their workforces in the next five years. (Though the survey also found that jobs in big data, fintech and AI are expected to double by 2030.)

So what should we do…been talking to friends in recruitment and here were some ideas they gave me for anyone who’s job seeking.

* Leverage your network - talk to ANY friendly ex bosses, ex colleagues, ask if there are roles going at their present companies, whether temporarily/freelance or permanent
* Skip ‘easy apply’ (there are too many people applying to use the LinkedIn function that allows you to send a job application just like that)
* If you’re less experienced, consider applying to small/medium sized companies - CNBC argue that 39% of all applications on the career site for college students and recent grads, Handshake, ended up at organizations with 250 employees or fewer
* Use a free job application assistant (Zippia and Swooped both offer decent ones) to generate versions of your resume tailored to the position and cover letters - then use some of the time you’ve saved to tweak further by adding in research about the company you’re applying to
* Use a Boolean search on LinkedIn to get really specific search results and filter out stuff you’re not looking for (google boolean search and you’ll get it!)
* Figure out your top dream companies to work for in the area (or who hire remotely). Start following key employees on socials and responding to work-related posts on LinkedIn with a comment or an observation. After warming them up, DM them to compliment them about their projects. If they respond warmly, see if they’d be up for doing an in-person or virtual coffee — explain you’ve always wanted to work at (Company name) and you’d love to hear more about the work they do there and how they got started there.

I have right around 2 dozen different brewers I have collected over the years but for my daily routine if I had only 2 that I could use I would pick the Clever Brewer for its size and versatility. I use it daily for brews over 30 grams as a v60 pour over. Most of the time I'm using between 50/60 grams at a 17/1 ratio for my wife and daughter and my friends that come over on Saturday mornings where I make 2 large batch brews of 60 grams with different coffee's for us to drink. They are always under the 4 minutes brew time and are good brews. Since I'm grinding a larger batch I use my Encore ESP on a 24 setting. I also use a melodrip with the pour over to get under the 4 minute mark and I have found its a great combo with good results. I also use it as an immersion brewer as well. 

The other brewer which I find more versatile than the Clever which is similar but smaller is the Hario Switch. I use it for 12-25 gram brews all of the time and mostly as hybrid types of brews. I do use it as a straight v60 leaving it open and it makes a great brew. With this brewer I use my ZP6 at 4 or my K-Ultra at 6.5. I can get my times anywhere I want them in the 2:30-3:30 range depending on the amount of coffee I'm brewing. I also like the 17/1 on this brewer as well.
