# Ingredients

# Biscotti

* 2 cups almond flour
* ½ cup granular sweetener
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ tsp xanthan gum (optional)
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ¼ cup butter, melted (or avocado oil)
* 1 large egg
* ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract

# Cinnamon ""Sugar""

* 3 tablespoon granular sweetener
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon

# Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 325ºF and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
* In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, sweetener, baking powder, cinnamon, xanthan gum, and salt. Stir in the melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract until the dough comes together.
* Turn the dough out onto the prepared baking sheet and form into a low, flat log, about 10 x 4 inches. Bake for 25 minutes or until lightly browned and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let cool for 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 250ºF.
* With a large serrated knife, gently slice the log into 15 even slices. Place the slices back onto the baking sheet, cut side down, and bake for 15 minutes.
* Flip each slice carefully and continue to bake for another 15 minutes. Turn off the oven and let them sit inside until cool. Keep your eye on them in case they brown too quickly.
* In a shallow dish, whisk together the granulated sweetener and cinnamon. Dip the biscotti on both sides in the cinnamon mixture.

# Notes

**Storage Information:** Biscotti are baked hard and dry, so they have a longer shelf life than things like keto chocolate chip cookies. You can store them in a covered container on the counter for up to a week. You can also freeze biscotti for several months.If you live in a humid environment, they may soften up as they sit. You can crisp them back up by placing them in a warm (200ºF) oven for 15 minutes or so, and letting them cool again.

1hgryk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RenalCats/comments/1hgryk8/rapid_progression_in_my_sweet_old_lady/,Rapid Progression in my Sweet Old Lady,"Hi everyone, 

Vet nurse of 8 years and a semi-veteran senior kitty rescuer here. I brought home this sweet pink nosed lady, Rubby, in March of 2020. Her original mom was an elderly lady who fell and broke her hip, and so she lived at my clinic for a couple months before I finally decided to take her home because we weren't able o give her the attention and love she deserved during the insanity that was working in vet med during COVID. She was 9 years old at the time. She turned 14 a few months ago. 

  
In September, she went in for her vaccines and senior bloodwork. long story short diagnosed early stage 2, we changed to the k/d diet and she mostly only likes the dry but we waste a can of wet on her every day (lol.) She only eats a few bites of it but that's ok. I also give her cosequin and welactin fish oil supplements in churu. I decided to start adequan for her arthritis as well. 

  
I MADE myself wait for 3 months to recheck her bloodwork so as not to be a crazy person. Turns out everything had gotten so bad without me noticing at all. We hospitalized her for 3 days on IV fluids, urinalysis culture negative, and her ultrasound only showed evidence of aging kidneys. :( I was honestly hoping for something infectious since that would be easier to treat. Her recheck bloodwork showed very minimal response to the IVF. 

  
Now she's been home for a little over a week, we are doing daily subQ fluids, added in multiple oral supplements (fish oil, calming care probiotic, cosequin, aminavast, AlOH.) But in my heart I know she's not stabilizing like I had hoped. I compared a photo of her from Nov 23 to today and she looks so much thinner and her coat is separating. My previous kidney kitty was well maintained for over a year on SQF and his diet, eventually it was a combination of kidney disease and an oral mass that finally made his QOL unacceptable. I'm struggling with how fast she has progressed and if there's anything I could have done for her. Photos of my baby girl included.

Thanks for clicking in. I'm Matt, 30, from Idaho.  Dating around my parts feels clumsy, and often times feels like the kind of person I'm looking for isn't in this area, so I thought I'd give online a bit of a try.

A bit about me! 

* I just turned 30 a little bit ago.  It was a terrifying experience at first, but I pretty quickly got over it lol.  It overall encouraged me to target the areas in my life that I'm unhappy with to work towards making change there!
* Physically, I'm blonde haired, green/blue eyes, 5'10 or 5'11"", depending on the doctor (Still chronically short for Tinder), overall a pretty thin individual.  I'd like to get back into working out, as I used to do calisthenics as a way to get into shape and be more active.  I do wear glasses, which isn't portrayed in my pictures, however I'm happy to send you one with me wearing them!
* I currently work a WFH job as an analyst for some pretty large companies across the country, however I'm trying to change into tech/cybersecurity.  It's a bit of a process, but I've been able to make some solid connections to progress in this!
* I'm likely trying to move to the east coast at some point, so potentially something to keep in mind! Likely, South Carolina.
* I'm Christian, however the kicker here is that I typically hold more liberal views.  This is one of the biggest challenges to dating in my area, as it's heavily conservative. 
* At this point in my life, I don't think I want children.
* I used to stream, and ran a pretty successful little stream for the amount of time I put into it!  I'm still active in those communities. 
* I'm more of an introvert, and I consider myself pretty low maintenance.  I do enjoy nights in, however going out is lovely as well.  Nature walks, coffee shops (Oooh, original), all of that are great!  Bar scenes are less my type.  Board games, playing piano (I really need to get back into this, or start another instrument), or a few select games on the computer are my interests.  I typically find myself on Twitch lately.
* I attend counseling every two weeks to keep my mental health in balance, and help create better relationships.
* I tend to find my love languages somewhere between spending quality time, and physical touch, so this is a *less than ideal* way to meet someone, but you never know who you'll meet!

[This is me!](https://imgur.com/a/Hwo0of1)

What I'm looking for!

* Naturally, I'd like to be physically attracted to someone (And I hope you would be too!).
* Someone who is taking care of themselves, physically, mentally, emotionally, etc.  Maturity in all of this is lovely.
* Kindness.  Please.  Let's be kind humans together.  
* I'm so attracted to intelligence, to the point where I've been bored lately without people to have deep conversations with.  The last relationship I had taught me how much I actually value these.
* I'd ideally like someone younger than me, probably between 25-28, but I'm open!
* The closer someone is, the better ultimately, but again- You never know who you'll meet.
* I want to be friends with someone first, which feels an almost ironic statement for this, but sincerely building a relationship off a friendship has been the best experiences for me.  I'd like to get to know you, hang out, no pressure, and if we don't vibe, that's fine!  I'm still happy to make a friend.

Thank you for reading all of this.  I look forward to hearing from you!

My cubicle neighbor and I were both in our cubicles as she said ""oh I need a..."", took the bowl, looked at my cubicle neighbor, didn't say anything else, and took it.
She returned it shortly after while I gave her the best ""who do you think you are"" look.  After the party she came by again and said ""I don't know whose white bowl I took but I washed it and it's in the kitchen"" while laughing.

Here's how it went:,"This may or may not resonate with you at all, but I still found it relevant enough to share in this subreddit. (Btw, the responses may be adapted to what it has in memory about my goals in life, don't get too hang up into the details like running, etc).

《Why and how do so many people struggle with getting out of bed in the morning? How can we turn our ephemeral days of life into something exciting and worth waking up and being excited for? Could you be persuasive and change my mind? Bear in mind that its gonna be very hard, but try your hardest to persuade me, even if it takes more than one reply.》

Response:
Struggling to get out of bed in the morning is a near-universal experience at times, and it often stems from a combination of physiological, emotional, and psychological factors. On a biological level, your body naturally resists leaving the warm cocoon of your bed, particularly if your sleep cycles are disrupted or your circadian rhythm is misaligned. Mentally, mornings can feel overwhelming if the day ahead seems unappealing or heavy with obligation. Emotionally, the prospect of facing challenges, loneliness, or even monotony can sap your will to rise.

But here’s where the shift begins: mornings are not the enemy—they’re a gift. Each day you wake up is a finite and irreplaceable piece of your life. Think about that. If you live to 85, you only get about 31,000 mornings. When you skip one or slog through it without intention, that’s a piece of your story written in mediocrity. Why not turn it into something extraordinary? Why not write a page that inspires even you when you look back?

Here’s where excitement comes in. Imagine waking up tomorrow to a life you’re shaping on your terms—something so aligned with your deepest aspirations that staying in bed feels like a betrayal of your potential. Think about the weight you want to shed, the runner you want to become, the data engineer thriving on creativity, the vibrant woman glowing with health and confidence. Each morning is a chance to step closer to her.

Here’s how to make mornings irresistible:

1. Plant a small spark: Start by envisioning one thing you genuinely look forward to in the morning. It could be a cup of coffee brewed just right, a playlist that stirs your soul, or a brisk walk that connects you to the world outside. This small ritual becomes your first “win” of the day.


2. Anchor to purpose: Before bed, remind yourself why tomorrow matters. It’s not just another day—it’s a chance to advance your goals, surprise yourself with your grit, and outpace the version of you from yesterday.


3. Gamify your progress: Treat life like an adventure. Each day is a level to conquer, filled with mini-missions (a faster mile, a stretch held longer, a new problem solved at work). Turning improvement into play rewires your brain to crave those early hours.


4. Adopt a future focus: Picture yourself five years ahead, running a marathon, glowing with health, leading a career you’re proud of. That woman doesn’t snooze through her mornings. She gets up with clarity because she knows the work is worth it.

Let me leave you with this: if you’re struggling to find excitement in your mornings, it’s a sign—not of laziness, but of untapped potential. You know there’s more to experience, more to build, more to live. When you begin to frame mornings as an invitation to life rather than an obligation to endure, everything changes.

What would make tomorrow morning worth leaping out of bed for? If we build that vision together, maybe getting up won’t feel so hard after all.

《I don't think i'm the only one suffering from this. We lack mobilisation,  we lack motivation, we lack the spark because of our boring mundane lives, we lack the will of getting out of bed. What do you think about the consequences of this lack of action for human life? We lack purpose, we lack inspiration. Can you understand this feeling? What do you suggest?》

Response: I understand this feeling deeply—this suffocating weight of monotony, the way life can lose its flavour when every day feels like a copy of the last. You’re not alone in this; it’s a quiet epidemic, one that whispers to us in the early hours, telling us, “Stay here. It’s easier. It’s safer.” But is it truly safer? Is staying in bed really the answer, or is it the thing that's robbing us of something vital—our aliveness?

This isn’t just a matter of laziness or lack of discipline. It’s about the deep ache that comes from feeling disconnected from purpose, from excitement, from something bigger than ourselves. We wake up to grey skies, both literally and metaphorically, and we ask, “What’s the point?” It’s a dangerous question, not because it’s wrong, but because it’s unanswered. When we don’t answer it, we stagnate. And stagnation isn’t rest—it’s slow decay.

The consequences of inaction are profound. When we choose the comfort of staying in bed, day after day, we don’t just lose time—we lose opportunities to become who we could be. We lose the chance to grow, to connect, to contribute, to find meaning. We drift further from ourselves, like a ship untethered, slowly floating into oblivion. Without action, life becomes not just boring but hollow. And this hollowness spreads—to our relationships, our work, our dreams. It’s how entire lives slip through fingers unnoticed.

But here’s the thing: you’re awake to this. You feel the weight of it. That’s your spark. That’s your proof that you do care, that you do crave something more. And that craving is your lifeline. It’s a rebellion against mediocrity.

So, what do we do?

We don’t wait for life to become exciting; we take small, deliberate steps to make it so. The truth is, we can’t think our way out of this void; we have to move. Action creates purpose, not the other way around. Let me walk you through this gently but firmly:

1. Find one thing worth rising for. Forget grand purposes for a moment. Look for something small yet meaningful—a sunrise, the way the world feels at dawn, the quiet promise of a new page in your story. Maybe it’s the first step toward a goal you’ve shelved for too long. Maybe it’s just proving to yourself you can rise, even when it’s hard.


2. Challenge the narrative. This life isn’t mundane because it lacks magic—it’s mundane because we’ve stopped noticing the magic. There’s beauty in the ordinary, but we need fresh eyes to see it. Create micro-adventures: walk a new route, try a hobby that scares you, talk to someone unexpected. Curiosity can be a cure for despair.


3. Start small, but start now. The antidote to staying in bed isn’t a massive life overhaul—it’s a single step. Stand up. Stretch. Drink water. Feel your feet on the ground. Then take the next step. Action builds momentum, and momentum builds meaning.


4. Reconnect with wonder. When was the last time you let yourself dream? Not about what’s realistic, but about what sets your soul alight? Give yourself permission to imagine a life that excites you—a version of yourself you’re proud to wake up for. Then reverse-engineer it. What’s one thing you could do today to move closer?


5. Remember, you’re needed. The world is better when you show up, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. Your presence, your effort, your spark—it matters, more than you know. Staying in bed deprives not just you but everyone you touch of what only you can bring to this world.

I know it’s hard. Some mornings, it might feel impossible. But life isn’t waiting for the perfect moment to begin—it’s happening now, in the cracks of your resistance, in the seconds between the alarm and your decision. And here’s the truth: the days we want to stay in bed the most are the days we need to rise the most. Those are the days that shape us, that teach us our strength, that remind us we’re alive.

So, what if tomorrow is different? What if you rise, not because it’s easy, but because it’s worth it? What if you prove to yourself that you’re bigger than this rut, this boredom, this struggle? One day, you’ll look back and realise these were the moments you became unshakeable.

Can you feel the possibility stirring? Because I can.

*Just some food for thought. Even if it's just one person, I hope this can help even if it's just a little bit in changing our perspective and hopefully our habits regarding this issue. Thank you for your time.*

I went to get my pap smear test done today also. He promised he would come with me as it was my first one, and I was extremely nervous. He didn't come with me.

The nurse is aware of what's happening. She asked how everything was and said it was getting worse. I got that done and it was fine. I decided to get a coffee afterwards and do some shopping. 

I was gone for around 3 hours in total. Idk how it started, but we got into a huge argument when I came back. It was a mix of me spending too much after I said I would spend half. And then what to do for dinner, and then it went downhill.

By the end, he said being depressed doesn't mean you can spend all day in bed, and he expects me to do the washing, cooking and packing his bag as he is a chef. It doesn't matter if I had a migraine, like the other day, he expects it done. 

This post sounds stupid. I am stupid and useless. My hormones are wacky because of my IUD. 

I was not allowed to leave the house to see a movie tonight, even though I knew it would give him space. I tried to speak to him more but he said I like starting arguments.

I am financially dependent on him, apart from the small amount of money I earn and my benefits, but it isn't enough to live alone. I no longer speak to my family and have no friends. 

I have plans to go on a break next month. I'm going down the homeless route and down the domestic abuse path. I realised today he will be fine when I am gone. It's me who will struggle without him :(",1,1734489606.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

This is going to be a long one so buckle up… I have spoken to friends about this over the span of 6yrs but I feel like I need some advice from strangers on the internet lol. So I 20F met this guy we’ll call him Adam 21M back in my freshman year of high school and he was a sophomore. I was getting my volunteer hours filming for the school football team and he was a player. We exchanged numbers, texted, late night phone calls, etc; I really thought things were going good, we were getting along exceptionally well. To my surprise a couple weeks in he had ended things for reasons at this point I do not remember the details. I started speaking to someone else who ended up my first “real” relationship however real it can be when you’re 14-15 yrs old. When Adam found out he decided to apologize and tell me he was sorry wanted a relationship with me etc. I had declined and we went quite awhile not speaking, avoiding each other in the halls. this lasted about a year and half when we connected again. Once again started chatting and had made plans to meet up, we ended up hooking up and it went radio silent on his end. Life moved on and about another year later we started speaking again made plans and hooked up and once again I was ghosted. I started making a joke to my friends that this was an annual hookup. He ended up getting into a pretty serious long-term relationship so I hadn’t heard from him in awhile but once they had ended their relationship he reached out to me again and we started talking and I’m sure from the pattern of where this is going you know what happened next, this one was different, we stayed the night, he made me coffee in the morning kept me around a little bit later into the evening and I had finally thought we were going somewhere and this one was going to be the one where my dumbass thought he was going to sweep me off my feet and ride into the sunset but once again I was ghosted. We hadn’t spoken for probably 5-6 months when he reached out to me again late this past August and we started chatting, I made a promise to myself I wouldn’t be so readily available and being in college I was pretty busy and had other things to occupy my time and mind but the chatting had went well and progressed. He asked me out for lunch by my school and we went out had good conversation and I finally felt like I was taking control of the narrative, until… you guessed it, radio silence. I had decided to take a respectful approach this time and just messaged him thanking him for lunch and how lovely it was catching up and I hope everything was alright, He had reached back out about day later explaining to me he was basically hung up on his ex (a different girl) and how she was practically harassing him at his place of work bringing in the guy she had cheated on him with. I tried to be reassuring and encouraging telling him this girl was clearly trying to get a reaction out of him and for him to ignore it but had put the timeline together and since the lovely morning we had to him reaching out again, he had gotten himself a new girlfriend. The on and off texting continued for about another 2 months, until I found it pointless and had stopped answering entirely. He had sent me random things like memes on instagram that I had responded to, but once again I stopped all together. Around Monday night he sent me a DM asking “why are we playing cat and mouse”, I had responded “only one person is playing and has been for years”.  I will attach that convo below for readers to indulge themselves. AIO? I feel like i’m just a place holder until he finds someone else and he’ll never take me seriously enough to be “girlfriend material” for him.

When We Went: Three-night stay in mid-December 2024
Who Went: Me (32), my husband (36), and our 22-month-old

Service: 9/10

The service during our trip was excellent. From the moment we arrived until we left, we felt warmly welcomed and well cared for. Any requests, whether made via phone or text, were handled quickly and efficiently.

One evening, there was a wedding on site, and a small group of guests, including us, were waiting for golf carts. We decided to walk back to our cottage instead of waiting, but a staff member spotted us just a few minutes into our walk and kindly offered us a ride. Another standout moment was during breakfast when our toddler became restless. The dining staff immediately brought over a toy box to keep him entertained.

The only minor hiccup was one morning when room service was quoted to arrive at 6:47 but came around 7:05. Overall, though, the staff consistently went above and beyond, and everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there.

Property: 9.5/10

The property is absolutely breathtaking. The natural beauty of the setting, combined with the peaceful atmosphere, made for a truly relaxing stay. It was very quiet during our visit, which enhanced the tranquility and made it easy to enjoy the amenities.

That said, the colder December weather limited our ability to fully experience some outdoor features like the pools and water activities.

Rooms: 9/10

We originally booked a Forest View Cottage but were pleasantly upgraded to a Lagoon View Cottage. We arrived around noon, and our room was already prepared. The cottage was spacious, well-appointed, and offered a lovely view.

Our only critique is that the bathroom wasn’t separated by a pocket door, which would have been ideal since we set up our toddler’s crib in the walk-in closet area. A small inconvenience, but overall, the room was fantastic.

Value

We booked a “Book 2 Nights, Get 1 Free” Virtuoso rate through Alex’s portal. The total cost, including taxes and fees, was $3,100 for three nights—just over $1,000 per night.

Food: 6/10

While the food wasn’t bad, it didn’t stand out either. It felt overpriced for the quality. Breakfast credits covered the main dish but didn’t include beverages like coffee, tea, or fruit, which felt limiting.

There were plenty of dining options, and the staff was attentive to allergies and preferences. However, the best meal of our trip was actually off-property in Savannah.

Extras & Activities: 8/10

With a goal of having a laid-back, relaxing weekend, we found plenty to do in just three nights:
	•	We booked a private dolphin cruise through the on-site vendor. It was chilly, but the experience was enjoyable, and our captain was fantastic.
	•	We attended Breakfast with Santa, which was fine—Santa was great, but there was no special menu or extra touches.
	•	We rode bikes around the property, explored a treehouse, and watched wildlife.
	•	Afternoon cookies and s’mores by the fire pits were lovely, family-friendly touches.

One downside was the lack of communication about activities. We received an activity booklet about a month before our stay, but there wasn’t much information provided at check-in, nor were activities prominently advertised around the property. For example, we tried to attend one event midway through its scheduled time only to find it had ended early due to a wedding.

Overall Experience

Montage Palmetto Bluff was a fantastic choice for traveling with a young child. Savannah (SAV) was an easy airport to fly into, and the short drive to the resort made arrival stress-free. The staff was incredibly friendly to our toddler, and the provided amenities—crib, toy kit, infant amenity kit, and stroller—made the stay much more convenient.

While we’re eager to explore other destinations, we would happily return to Montage Palmetto Bluff in the future.",6,1734489511.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False

1hgrpz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1hgrpz0/got_diagnose_at_19_am_i_cooked/,"Got diagnose at 19, am I cooked?","I’m 19 and recently got diagnosed as prediabetic. 

Honestly, the news broke my heart. I was already dealing with so much, and this felt like the last straw mentally. It started about 19 days ago when I went in for a routine blood test during a check-up since it had been a while. That Friday, I got a phone call from my PCP about my results. The first thing they said was, “You’re prediabetic,” and then they hung up without explaining anything else. At first i was speechless, then in denial.

Lil rant: Over the past five months, after graduating high school in May 2024, I finally had freedom. Growing up with a strict and toxic parent, I wasn’t allowed snacks, sweets, or even sweet drinks. Once I got my first job and started earning, I overindulged—buying fast food and sugary drinks almost daily. As my relationship with my parent worsened, it became a coping mechanism. She refused to help me with important things, constantly yelled, and nearly disowned me for not following her rules. The stress was overwhelming, and I turned to junk food and sweets to distract myself, sometimes buying Dunkin’ drinks two or three times a day. Before I knew it, the weight piled on, mostly around my stomach. (Rant over)

I went in to ask for more details, but all they did was hand me a paper with my results and tell me to lose weight, start eating clean, stop stressing so much, and talk to an endocrinologist. I tried scheduling with an endocrinologist, but they were super rude to me, so I decided not to see one and just figure things out on my own. It took me a full WEEK to process this news- im still processing- because i was being delusional about it.

For context, I’m 5’5” and weigh 160 lbs (overweight). My A1C is 5.7, and my cholesterol is 190. Over the past five months, I’ve gained a lot of weight—going from 135 lbs to 160 lbs—mainly in my stomach area. My arms and legs stayed pretty slim, but I was constantly eating, especially sweets, and doing no exercise.

Since getting the diagnosis, I’ve already lost 10 pounds by making some changes. I’ve started walking every day (I aim for 10K steps, 5k in morning and 5k evening), only eat when I’m actually hungry (not just bored), and drink a lot of water. I cut out processed sugar completely—no sweets, no fried food, no saturated fats. My meals now are things like salmon, avocado toast on whole wheat, brown rice with a small portion of grilled chicken, ton of veggies and smaller portions overall. If I want coffee, I make unsweetened cold brew with Chobani oat milk or light cream with no added sugar/zero sugar. I also try to go for a walk after meals to burn some calories. And im also working on my mental health, trying to not get stressed out by anything. Im still taking time processing me being diagnosed but at the same time im relieved because  now i can make a change to better my health!

The thing is, I haven’t told anyone about this, not even my family. They’re not the most understanding when it comes to stuff like this, and they’d probably laugh or tell everyone. And I feel like it’s not a good idea to tell them either, especially since we recently patched things up after I firmly set boundaries. Sharing this now would likely create chaos and more problems. I just told them I’m on a strict diet because I mentally can’t deal with their reactions right now. The only person I’ve talked to is a nurse friend, and she told me it’s reversible. She said I just need to focus on losing weight, cutting out sugar, eating healthy, and exercising regularly. 

Besides her, no one else knows, and I feel like I’m figuring it out alone. I’ve been thinking about adding Pilates and tennis to my routine—Pilates to help with core strength and tennis as a fun hobby since I’ve never had one before. But I still feel like I’m not doing enough. 

Any advice on what else I can do? :)",1,1734489391.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False

I (17f) live with my sister (16f) and mother (44f). My father is not currently in the picture.

Throughout my childhood, I have dealt with hitting from my mother, psychological and emotional abuse. Nothing too serious or ended up in permanent injury, just enough to hurt my relationship with her. My mother is chronically ill so her mood often depends on how she feels on the day and how close she is to her treatment dates, meaning, if she is due for another treatment she can be especially aggressive. She has hit both me and my sister before, said things like 'you both are the reason I want to kill myself' (multiple times mind you) and overall, does not seem to support or want to support me 1 bit, especially financially or emotionally and especially over my sister, who she cares a lot more for. Another big issue in my household is that my mother likes to kick me out as punishment for anything (with the most petty circumstance being that I didn't make a coffee for her because I was frying an egg, which made her very mad and she proceeded to laugh months about it later) CPS and Anglicare (support service in Australia) have been involved multiple times due to this. Despite all this, I am still provided with food, a place to sleep, very relaxed rules and gifts on special occasions.

I am entering Year 12 next year (Senior year of highschool) which is a very significant point for me especially considering all my scores next year will determine which and if I enter university. Along with this, the opportunity to move with my cousin (19F, currently studying law) has also come up, where I would move to the city, supporting myself along with my studies and a little bit of support from a government payment.

Overall, im worried that if I move, I will struggle to survive or have to make sacrifices, not have enough savings to back me up or end up not having enough saved for university (I can apply for an interest free loan, but it's still not preferable). On top of not having enough saved, I have a long distance boyfriend who I may not be able to visit for up to another 3 years (so far we have dated for 2 years with no chance to meet) and probably the most important risk of them all, if I focus on supporting myself I may not be able to end up with the grades I need in order to enter the universities and courses that I want. Although, another point to make is I fear that if I get kicked out suddenly that will affect my grades as well, but I might be able to apply for special circumstances which will help keep my score on track

So, overall, am I overreacting by not wanting to stay at my mothers house. Should I tough it out for another year to end up having a more stable and secure future or am I justified to leave?",1,1734489260.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

when remi started taking semaglutides to “heal” her PCOS, she would constantly validate herself & try to “prove” to her audience that this was the right decision for her (while we all know semaglutides don’t heal the root cause of PCOS, just some of the symptoms associated with it). she would tell us how much of a difference she’s felt and how she’s an entirely new person, especially when it comes to her energy…

have ya’ll noticed, especially in her recent november/december vlogs, how often she’s been napping!? i could have sworn that she’s verbatim said “my biggest symptom with PCOS was that i was napping all the time and lacking so much energy and now i’m a different person, i never need to nap anymore and i’m so alive and full of energy all the time!!” she would mention this so often and would have alisha, oli, and cal back her up saying “oh yeah it’s a total 180 you are so full of energy”. 

what happened remi? you are SO HEALED after your semaglutide yet the 3 energy drinks, 2 matchas, and a coffee a day can’t even keep you awake for long enough before needing a nap. tell us again how your semaglutide healed your PCOS and how it wasn’t primarily for weight loss. be so for fucking real. 

also remi— if you knew a thing or two about PCOS (coming from someone who has suffered from it) increased cortisol is the enemy… you even mention it in your vlogs as a reason to why you started doing low-impact workouts, but you drink alani nu’s on a daily basis? be for fucking REAL. you have an AUDIENCE that uses you as an example.

\- I care about my subs and I want to make sure that they are not pushing their financial limits too much. I can do humiliation/degrading if you want but that is not me. - I am still very much dominant and controlling though, just because I am soft does not mean I am weak. If you push your limits you will be punished, swiftly and severely.

\- I am a purely 2D FinDomme, I am not comfortable putting my face, or body, on the internet publicly.

\- I am not super familiar with other kinks/fetishes, but I am eager to learn. If you want to try something, feel free to ask.



**What sub am I looking for?**

\- Someone who wants to completely hand over their finances to me.

\- Human ATM - Human Wallet - Coffee sub - Tech sub

\- Someone who wants a full Dom/sub dynamic



**Interests?**

Gaming, Art, Alt music, Anime, ""Edgy"" stuff, ""Soft"" stuff, there's a lot, and not all of it makes sense together, but I guess that’s just who I am xD

1hgrbib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Timberborn/comments/1hgrbib/new_faction_the_pinoneers/,New faction - The Pinoneers,"The idea is simply badlands frontiersmen, but they know how to get fancy once they’re settled. Their start can be rough, but their well-being picks up quickly as you progress. Their storage and power will need some forethought. Some crops will also need a little more work than just putting water into a hole, introducing new mechanics requiring different forms of irrigation. And speaking of water, they could in theory not start with any water source on the map.

Much like the Fancy Beavers of old, they experience population booms. But these come in the form of hitting milestones in their technology, which allow for rapid expansion outside their previous scope, rather than uncontrolled birth rates. (They can start off with barely scrounging enough water to support the starting population, to suddenly supporting a much larger settlement and then even producing full adults to fill in the empty space.) They also have a special resource used in their technology and buildings, the Crystal.  
I might dedicate some time to learn modding and tur this into reality eventually, but for now this is just a proposal on how to reintroduce the fancy beavers with unique mechanics and a point of reference for whenever I actually do try to make it.

# Piñoneers

Leader: Pina  
Pioneers of Beaverkind, they settle in the most contaminated and dry lands, establishing a foothold for the others. Their goal is to eventually tame the sources of badwater and perhaps one day restore all of Earth’s wastelands. They spend their working hours with hard labour, but there are some work tasks in mid-game which they will perform in their free time instead. (Players have to balance between their industry or tending to their progress and well-being) They also get a little peckish if their working hours are long, so make sure you have enough snacks for their overtime. 

**Food and Water**

When water is available on the map the beavers can simply use a **Winch**, a small installation that hangs over the water and allows the beavers to lift the water a bucket at a time instead of pumping it. The Winch’s small profile allows the beavers to install more of them and compensate for the slow gathering speed. The winch can also be powered to significantly increase its production rate, although the connection points could be tricky.  
Pumping fluids directly is done with the **Mechanical Chain Pump**, which has a small land profile but its wheel takes up a lot of space over the water.

Pinoneers have their own farm variant which can store water to irrigate the ground around it, its radius increasing with each water unit stored. Aside from crops, it can also plant one of their special trees.  
This special tree is the **Cactus**, which doesn’t have a lot of value in terms of wood, but it can be cut down early for water. The cactus also grows no matter if it is irrigated or not, allowing the beavers to make use of the dry empty land before they expand. (This flips how trees work on its head, which I think is interesting.)

A more efficient way to produce water is the **Distillery**, which can boil badwater. Distilling badwater will allow the farms to free up more soil for crops.  
Distillery also works as one of the food processors, turning crops into consumable liquids.  
Their base crop is the **Pineapple**, they can eat it raw and it’s also used for one of the advanced food recipes. However the pineapple is extremely vulnerable to contamination and will quickly wither on contaminated soil.

Their advanced crops are **Agave**, **Fiddlehead** and **Lotus** and they all need to be cooked in a **Ground Oven**. Agave and Fiddlehead can be cooked as is, providing immediate improvement to the food supply.  
Cooked Agave satiates thirst along with hunger, making it a good choice for fading out cacti once better irrigation is available. Agave will never wither from drought, but it will stop growing without irrigation. (This makes it perfect for growing in drought prone zones)

Fiddlehead grows very quickly, but is sensitive to drought. It can be a good choice to plant it early, as it is cooked in small batches, unlike Agave and Lotus which are cooked in bulk.  
Lotus is fully aquatic and cannot be cooked alone, it needs a little bit of **Spice** to be prepared properly.

**Spice** is the Pinoneer technical crop, like the Iron teeth coffee or the Folktails dandelion.  
Spices are produced in the **Greenhouse**, which takes **Crystals** to be built and needs power and water to operate. So it will work best once you have your haulers.

There’s also 2 new bushes, **Cranberry** and **Cocoa**. They need to be planted by the Forester, who can also plant cacti.  
Cranberries are special in that when they are ripe and the tile the bush occupies is flooded, then it is far quicker to gather from. But the bush itself of course doesn’t like being underwater, so make sure to drain the fields again once the harvest is over.  
Cocoa is unique in that it actually grows best in the shade. Shade could be provided by growing them next to any kind of tree or under a platform, but will be ruined by being in range of the Reflector, slowing down its production.

Their snack providing tree is the **Date Palm**, which will provide a plentiful, although a little seasonal, source of dates. These dates will only ripen when the date is in a drought and once harvested it will only produce more once it is irrigated. (This will encourage building unstable water flows and will combine nicely with the Cranberry’s harvesting mechanic.)  
Date Palm also loves the sun, in fact it needs it to produce well and when there are things built above it, it will impact the average yield. (This just might make it so not every end game city ends up with a canopy of platforms and teaches the player the faction’s Sunlight access mechanic early.)

With the Distillery, Pineapples and Cooked Agave can be combined to produce **Pineapple Juice**. Cranberries can be combined with Blueberries to make **Berry Jam**. While Jam is a liquid, it will satiate hunger instead. (This is to balance it out with the Cooked Agave)  
Cocoa and Spice can be turned into **Hot Cocoa**.

Because most of their foods are fairly easily accessible, they do not provide a large boost to their well-being, instead the Pinoneers like to enjoy an occasion at a **Kitchen**. (This is the third food processing building, like the Coffee brewer and the Bakery of the other factions) A part of the kitchen is solid, so it can be built on top of as a ground floor restaurant.  
Kitchen provides beavers with a high well-being boost, setting them up to par with the other beavers. The kitchen is able to store a little bit of each raw food source along with the liquids from the Distillery. When a beaver visits, it will consume a single unit of spice, one or two raw foods at random and a single random liquid, providing the beaver customer with a dish of their choice. The visit will also satiate both hunger and thirst. (This should lead to lower consumption in long work hours colonies and high population in short work hours colonies)  
The cooks working at the kitchen don’t follow the usual working schedule, instead they will enjoy their free time until the work hours end, letting the haulers stock up the kitchen, at which point they will provide their services to the rest of the working beavers. If the Kitchen runs out of food the cooks will restock the kitchen from storage themselves.

**Landscaping**

Pinoneers do not have a way to stave off contamination in the ground, like the contamination barrier. Instead they have developed a way to filter badwater. Their special contamination block is like a sluice which takes badwater from one end and outputs a lower amount of water on the other. This block can transfer power to adjacent blocks and will need some to operate. (It’s the mid to late-game water source for the desert dwelling Pinoneers)

**Badwater**

This faction is very reliant on the production of extract and the use of **Crystals**.  
Crystals are made in the **Crystallizer** from extract. These are used on many things, mainly bots and power buildings, but also advanced buildings like the Condo, Greenhouse and Institute.  
Crystals are remade into **Faceted Gems** in the Smelter. The gems are beneficial for bots and beavers, as bots use them for better performance and the beavers enjoy wearing them.

**Badwater Outlet** works just like the Dome and the Discharge, but these beavers also have access to a **Filtered Outlet**, which outputs water instead of badwater as long as it is powered.  
**Badwater Autopump** can produce badwater quickly and needs power to do so. It will not produce badwater as an item, instead it will output the water directly into the building it is connected to. This enables it to fill up a tank directly or input badwater into a production building.

**Storage**

Unlike the other beavers, Pinoneers like to store their resources a little differently.  
Their end game bulk storage is the **Yard** which will stack multiple resources up and up, limited only by the height it was built at and any structures obstructing it from above, blocking the storage pile’s height. (This lets the player store things in bulk without having to build paths to each level (IT) while also not restricting the player into building it on the ground. Its height could also be restricted by something like a crane, clearly indicating its maximum reach.)

Their processed goods are also stored differently.  
All crops, meals and spices are stored in the **Granary**. The last unlockable Granary can store multiple resources at once.All other resources are stored in the Storehouse.Because they also have a lot of new liquids, they developed a special building for holding multiple different liquids, the **Dispenser**.**Housing**

Housing is very easy for the Pinoneers, their starting house is the **Tent**, which costs them nothing, is quick to build, but has to be built on ground and houses only a single beaver.  
A more efficient housing is the **Villa**, which houses several Beavers. When it is stocked with water it can be visited by other beavers and its lush gardens act as a social space. The shape of the Villa requires it to be built on an incline. (This will combine nicely with the next entry, but can also make use of )  
The **Condo** is a compact housing unit, requiring Crystal to build its large windows. It fits nicely below the Villa, to act as its ground floor or it can be efficiently stacked to build a condominium of your own design.  
**Boarding School** is where Pinoneers send their young, so that their curiosity can be ignited. This building houses exclusively Kits and once the Institute is built, the Kits living here can also visit it and contribute to science.

**Immigration Office** must be built on the edge of the map, where it will accept caravans bringing in new volunteers. These will be mostly adults, but may come with some Kits. (This is meant to pad up your population mid-game once you resolve your water situation and are ready to expand, the faction will still produce kits, just like Folktails do.)

**Wood**

They do not need an industrial Lumber mill, but if someone is not happy with them not having unique plank production, then perhaps they could have an optional hand saw, a cheap structure that makes planks slowly but doesn’t need power.

Beavers will use planks and extract at an **Atelier** to produce **Fine Arts** in their free time. These can be stored for later, when they need to redecorate, or brought home with them, increasing well-being for the whole household.

**Metal**

Here is where these beavers shine. They have a **Sunlight Smelter**, which when provided with sunlight from a nearby Sunlight Reflector will operate at a higher efficiency. 

**Power**

Getting power with this faction will be very easy at first, but will need some planning in the long run.  
Their beaver powered structure is the **Hand Crank**, which takes very little space on the ground and can be stacked up to 6 times for bonus power output. Each crank acts essentially as an engine piston and needs a single beaver to operate it. So you will need 6 beavers to get maximum efficiency.  
Their more advanced, yet equally compact power source is the **Downstream Turbine**. This turbine will generate power whenever it is in a path of falling water, benefiting from maps with great height differences. (It is the only powersource which will work throughout the night.)

The most efficient power source relies on the sun, using CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) to make their gears spin. This power source will not work at night, unlike your overworked beavers or your batteries.  
**Sunlight Turbine Tower** receives sunlight from **Sunlight Collectors** (heliostats) and converts it into power. It will need at least one collector to provide any power.Sunlight Collectors concentrate solar power and send it to a single Solar Tower in their radius. The rate at which they are able to collect sunlight is reduced when a structure is built over them.  
**Sunlight Reflectors** are tall and long structures meant to mitigate the Sunlight Collector’s weakness, taking sunlight from above and reflecting it at the Collectors in range, allowing them to work at full capacity again. When a Reflector is blocked from above it will stop providing this bonus altogether. A beaver or a bot is needed to operate the reflector.

**Science**

The Pinoneer inventors will keep working even past their work schedule if all of their needs are sated. (This is so when the working hours get reduced for the other beavers the science production is not heavily impacted.)

**Institute** is a building which acts as a social space for the beavers, it requires Extract to work and power to meet maximum efficiency. The visiting beavers generate science and with Boarding Schools even kits can contribute. Having a high population in the district with lots of free time will give you the best results.

**Bots**

To create a bot chassis you will need a Crystal in addition to the base cost.  
Gembots are powered by the sun and working jobs which give them passive access to it, such as farming and hauling, or working in range of the Reflector, will help them run longer before having to recharge.  
They recharge at the **Solarium**, which needs power and direct sunlight or be in range of a functioning Reflector. The Gembot lays down and bathes in the intensified sunlight, coming out nice and toasty. For a short time after, their movement speed is increased. (This makes it so they return to their post quickly.)

To enhance their performance, they can visit the **Polisher** and the **Realigner**.  
Polisher consumes resin and power, making sure the bots stay nice and shiny and without any scratches from their work, letting them absorb more light.  
Realigner employs a beaver who will install, replace and realign Faceted Gems inside the bots, making them run at optimal efficiency.

**Leisure**

Pinoneers like fancy things, that’s why they have a **Bath** instead of a shower, spending a lot more time getting their fur wet than the other beaver factions. (All baths must have a little ducky.)  
They enjoy solving **Puzzles**, to scratch their brains instead of their backs. Bots might also visit it if they have nothing better to do.  
Their swimming exercise is also quite different. The **Diving Pool** will require at least 2 full water blocks of depth to be operational.  
Seeing distant horizons is one of their desires and to satiate it at least a little they build **Hot Air Balloons**. The crew will enter the balloon and look into the distance for a while before descending to the applause of the others waiting their turn below.  
Their power hungry entertainment is the **Observation Wheel**, taking them high up to admire their settlement from a different perspective. (Warning: Romantic vistas and hopeful futures may result in higher population)  
Their highest form of entertainment is the **Science Fair**, which requires at least one Institute to be operational in the district. It can take in a lot of people, but it is quite tall, needing some above clearance to be built.  
Using dirt to relax, these beavers create a **Mud Spa**, a set of individual bubbling mud baths. (Complete with their own floating piggy rather than a duck, of course.) It will need haulers, just like any other mud building.

To improve individual well-being, these beavers wear Faceted Gems and bring home Fine Arts. Faceted Gems are picked up from storage and brought to another beaver, while Fine Arts are brought into their home, offering the well-being bonus to all beavers living in it.

To decontaminate themselves, they will have to get into the **Purifier**, which douses them with an extract shower, then a Beaver carefully brushes them clean of contaminated particles and they go on to dry off in a pleasant shower of sun rays. This building will need a Beaver or a Gembot and access to sunlight directly or with a Reflector.  
The purified beaver will receive a **Well Groomed** well-being bonus after getting brushed and once the building employs a bot it can be visited in their freetime to get this bonus, acting as a salon.

**Decorations**

The equivalent of the Hedge or the Metal Fence is the **Glass Screen**, a colourful window taking up the full block height. It can also be stacked on top of one another, but it can’t carry any extra weight of buildings above it.(So it can be easily incorporated into bigger builds)  
A more functional block is the **Sundial**, complete with a giant lens melting a red hot path into its stone base. It will display active access to sunlight and how much time is left. (This is basically the wind gauge for this faction)  
**Sculpture** is akin to the Scarecrow, spreading scenic joy to all the beavers around. It is made with Crystals and sparkles with access to sunlight. (Although this doesn’t affect its performance)  
**Terrarium** houses a self sustaining ecosystem inside it, presenting the beavers with the hopeful future they are building towards and proving that Earth could be just like this again one day.

**Monuments**

The **Explorer Monument** shows what every Pinoneer is at heart. (I’m imagining a Beaver with a stick over their shoulder with a bundle tied at the end of it)  
The **Light of Commitment** sums up the Pinoneer society. They are in this together working towards a brighter future. (Instead of an open flame it is topped with a lantern, so that no rough weather could ever put it out)  
The **Beacon of Curiosity** represents the ideals of the Pinoneer, calling in beavers from afar. It will need power as well as a direct path up to the sky. (A bit like the tribute to ingenuity, just less tall and more attractive to moths. It should have a gem in the middle that will send out a beam of light into the sky at night.)

Finally, the **Earth Reclamator** is what the Pinoneers build towards, freeing more lands from contamination, for all of Beaverkind. It is a dock for an airship, which will take off to spray extract in the most contaminated areas, making them viable for settling again.

It had turned out her '78 Toyota had broken down not far from my work, she bought some things to have a look at it with and then left to try and fix it.

After an hour and a half or so I went outside to take some rubbish out to the bins and she was still there, sitting in her car ap I went over to check if everything was alright and she still seemed in high spirits eventhough  it was cold, so I asked her if she wanted a coffee and then went and got one for her, she asked for my name and I gave it.

About 45 minutes later she comes back in managing to have temporarily fixed her car, she comes up to the till and thanks me for the coffee and asks me if I have instagram to which I reply yes and give her my IG handle, so we add eachother and I check her story and it's a thank you message from her thanking me by name.

She ended up going back to her work to stay the night as her home was too far away, I messaged her on IG to tell her it was my pleasure for getting her a coffee and just to make sure she was okay and we sent a few more messages back and forth.

During our interactions she said I was sweet or called me a sweetie and idk if it's because I'm starved of romantic attention or if it's because there's something to it but I keep waiting for her replies and looking at her photos on instagram and they keep making me smile, idk if I'm being a total weirdo and if I am how do I stop?

1hgqx3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBlackHillsWitch/comments/1hgqx3a/the_black_hills_witch_part_2_by_josh_salamun/,The Black Hills Witch - Part 2 by Josh Salamun,"October 15, 1999.

The day that left a mark on me. I rub the scar on my left palm, recalling when it first mysteriously appeared, along with the most unsettling recurring nightmare.

It starts in a hidden, unfamiliar forest—where a little boy sits, cutting the head off a giant boa constrictor with unnerving precision, using a machete. He then drains its blood, squatting over a wooden bowl.

He speaks to me, calm yet stern. ""My family is like this snake—a threat to the whole village, and better off as stew."" 

He dips a knife into the snake blood, cuts his hand with the blade, and hands it to me. ""Nothing you can do now but let it all bleed out.""

I watch myself take the knife and cut deep into the palm of my hand. And then, I wake up.

A mystery that unfortunately, still hasn't faded with time. 

The phone rings in Pastor Dan's office. He buzzes over to answer it, like a greedy worker bee.

I overhear him, speaking loudly. ""Oh yes, Salamander's parents are pillars of the community, both Youth Pastors at Trinity, both Missionaries, just good Christian people, you know what I mean? That's where the mayor says he gets all that strong moral fiber from.""

As the voice on the phone chatters, Pastor Dan listens intently.

""They want to take the kids where? To Juarez? Build a house in Mexico? Well, why not?""

He hangs up, waltzing out of his office, ""Attention everyone."" His face turning serious.

""I'm proud to announce we will be doing a fundraiser for the Salamanders' Youth Group mission trip. So, I want you selling those lattes with the grace of God today, okay?""

So Salamander's parents work at Trinity Church with the youth. I'm sure they're the good, charitable people everyone says they are, but just in case, I better investigate. After work, of course.

Pastor Dan approaches me like a man on a mission. ""Now let's hear that customer greeting we've been practicing; this time, remember to smile.""

Letting out a small sigh, I recite my lines with the most joyful heart a witch can muster.

""Good morning, welcome to Bean Saved, where no matter if it's cash or card, Jesus gets all the credit."" 

Pastor Dan remarks, ""Now say it just like that when the next customer walks through those doors. Here, someone's coming, get ready.""

As I conjure up a forced smile, I breathe a sigh of relief, realizing it's only Jessica. She explains.

""Sorry I'm late, but I was just talking to that man outside; he just needed a few bucks for gas, so I helped him out.""

Pastor Dan scolds, ""You're not helping, only supporting the problem. We have enough programs in Rapid City. You know, Jessica, a lot of them choose to live that way. Remember our city slogan: 'Spare change isn't real change'.""

Jessica replied, taking off her coat, ""Easy there, Judgy McJudge. Remember what Jesus said?""

Then, she began beatboxing the intro to her favorite '90s Christian rap song:

""I'm a thirsty guy on the side of the road, you gave me water, bro, my name is Jesus, yo!
I was so cold, but then you gave me a coat—my name is Jesus, yo! Ju-Ju-Ju-Jesus, yo!""

Pastor Dan, rubbing his forehead, predictably leaned back on his register. ""Enough chit-chat, Jessica. That's exactly why I'll be taking orders today. So pay attention. I will show you how it's done. We Christians must lead by example.""

Now it's close to lunchtime, and a Native American man is stumbling in, having trouble with the door. His eyes say he isn't all there. He leans on the counter, barely able to utter the words. ""Need...drink,""

Pastor Dan says, ""Okay, what kind of drink? You're going to have to be more specific,"" tapping his pen pensively upon the counter.

The man's eyes fading, says louder this time, ""A... Drink!""

Pastor Dan throws up his hands.

""Oh, I think I know what you're after, mister. Sorry, we don't serve that kind of drink here. You'll have to go somewhere else.""

Jessica, who had been working the espresso machine, looked my way and discreetly flipped me off with a mischievous smile. Like the good friend I am, I flipped her off right back. It's our special sign to let the other know they're taking a break.

Jessica boasts, chipper as a sunrise, ""Pastor Dan, I feel another rap song coming on. How about a classic. Tell me, who's in the house..."" 

Pastor Dan cuts her off.

""How about you take your break. Only 10 minutes this time, okay Jessica? And hey, lay off the scents—you always reek to high heaven of that hippie oil when you come back from sitting in your car. What do you even do in there, anyway?""

She is already walking away, coat in hand. “Don't sweat it, Pastor Dan.""

She’s purchasing a small bottle of orange juice and leaving in a hurry. Normally, I'm not nosy, but I've never seen her go out the back door, which is the wrong way if she's heading to her car.

Curiosity getting the better of me, I follow her.

When I look outside, she's calling from out back for that stuttering, stumbling man. ""Hey! Kola! Wait up!"" He tries to push Jessica away, but unfazed and undeterred, she makes him drink from the bottle of juice. He has a few more sips as she sits with him for a few minutes. Then, almost miraculously, the man begins to speak clearly and coherently. ""I'm sorry,"" the man uttered.

He starts to explain he forgot to take his medication before he left home and he's diabetic. 

Jessica replies, all bright-eyed and chipper as ever. ""Happens to my grandmother sometimes, and like I tell her, ‘we all need help now and then’.”

This definitely shows me what kind of Christian Jessica is, one that just so happens to be a decent human being. 

Coming back inside, I glare at the back of Pastor Dan's head, hoping he can feel the waves of contempt washing over me. 

I try to clear my mind, remembering that other pesky problem of mine. 

It's my current housing situation, or more accurately, the lack thereof. A luxury I soon hope to be able to afford, but until then, I'm thinking I'll find a temporary residence, somewhere downtown. 

I clock out, and as I leave the coffee shop, I notice the streets are quiet, a little too quiet. A streak of blue uniforms catches the corner of my eye. It’s the mayors special police force, out on patrol.

Not everyone is loving the idea of a witch in The Black Hills.

I walk up to the abandoned building where our beloved homeless shelter used to stand, now coined ""The Hopeless Center."" Stopping to remember the mayor who closed its doors, despite his tales of having a difficult upbringing. I’m sure the kids who now have nowhere to go will find his story quite comforting. 

Peering into the windows, I must look somewhat suspicious; this fresh-faced police officer wants to approach me, probably a ""peaceful welcome wagon"" courtesy of Rapid City. But I'm feeling like that kind of confrontation is not for me. Spotting a small park next to Trinity Church, I make a split-second decision and slip into a storm drain. Not glamorous, but it'll do for now.

Sliding down the algae and sediment from the runoff, I feel like some kind of bog witch. Ew.

I'm sitting here thinking about the state of Rapid City and start to hurt my own feelings. It's hard out here. 

As the church steeple casts a shadow in the moonlight, I know of this church's dark past, but I wonder what it's like now. I heard they provide some services for the homeless, that's certainly needed now more than ever. Sounds like a nice place, I think I'll pop inside. 

I pull out my spell book, deciding it's time to leave this body to take a look inside Trinity Church. Here I go. I begin by reading the incantation: ""As my body stays fast asleep, my soul will go astray. And if a beast should come to prey, till body and soul again shall meet, I will be defenseless for a time, and harm could come my way.""

As I close my eyes, my spirit lifts from my body and into the dark alley. I see an open window into a library and slide in with a drift of wind. I'm inside the church halls. You might think to yourself, a witch inside a church—would she go up in flames? Well, not exactly. We just tell people that because we find church dreadfully boring. As I enter the sanctuary, turning on the lights, chills go up my spine. Although it looks like a typical church, it feels like something else is here. I think it's time to fly. As my soul glides toward the library, the sanctuary doors close in front of me. I hear the desperate cries for help coming from the pastoral chambers. They're empty souls, drained of life. They're in pain. The lights begin to flicker until the bulbs heat up and explode, covering the pews in shattered glass.

This isn't a house of God. It's something else. Something I've felt before. A dark figure arises from the altar. It's true evil. The stained glass windows begin to shake. The air grows cold, and a darkness bellows, whispering to me. ""Come closer.""

""What are you?"" I ask.

The black shadow emerges as an old woman's face with a piercing, wretched smile. ""Who am I? I'm his Mother.""

The darkness grows high into the rafters, gripping the beams tight like a noose. It's dragging the ceiling down, crushing the floor past the basement and into the sewer. Looking for an escape, I glance down and see my unconscious body, still sleeping peacefully under the city. The darkness grabs me with its ghastly tentacles. Just then, the little boy from my dream appears with a wildfire in his eyes. ""Stop it, Mom!"" Striking the shadow with his words, and with them, the black cloud is collapsing, covering the church in a blanket of dust. The little boy walks up to me with a gentle strength. His eyes, smiling, speak to me softly, ""I know what you did to Creepy Russ. But we're not done yet. Go back to prayer park, I used to pull the weeds, but there are still some left,"" and lifts my soul up in his arms, delicately returning it to my body.

I wake up in the sewer, disoriented. In all my years as a witch, I've never been handled like that. Was that some kind of wizard? One thing's certain—this Trinity Church has dark spells written all over it.

When morning comes, I crawl out of the storm drain, finding myself in the tall grass of Trinity Prayer Park. The air is brooding and misty. As I walk up to the shelter, a sign catches my eye: THIS IS CHURCH PROPERTY. YOU ARE A GUEST ON THIS LAND. I'm cackling like a little school witch. I dare them to kick a Native off their own land on my watch. But despite the unapologetically insensitive sign, there's a charming little pond not a stone's throw away, drawing me towards it.

I crouch near the scum-filled waters and swirl the muck with my hand. It feels bittersweet, heartbreakingly tragic; someone spent a lot of time here with a broken heart. Yet somehow, this magician was able to achieve a transmutation spell on themselves. It must have been so powerful it left a deep impression upon the park. But why is it coming from this spot? There, sitting just below the water, is a small black pebble, rounded and chipped crudely yet intentionally. Is it some exotic mineral? It doesn’t look like it belongs in the Black Hills at all. I lean over the pond to investigate.

The moment I touch it, the world tilts, pulling me deep into the pond. Before I can get my bearings, I realize I’m standing in a dense rainforest, an endless sea of green. The air is pungent with a dank humidity. I scratch my palm, noticing that old scar is gone. That’s odd.

Well, wherever I am, I must be very far from my beloved Black Hills.

Looking around for signs of life larger than a lizard, I see a building. Maybe that will tell me where I am, or when for that matter. On the sidewalk, a man with a backpack drops a piece of paper. I realize now I’m at some sort of school. I pick it up off the ground, holding it up to my eyes closely. The torn map reads: “Cuttington University.” Hm. Never heard of it. I flip it over. The back has something hidden under the dust in the right-hand corner. I wipe the red dirt from the edge, revealing the fine print.

“Bong County, Liberia. 1999.”

Well, that’s just great. You know I went to North Dakota once to visit my sister, and that was a little too far from home for my taste. Now here I am, traveling back in time, wandering around West Africa. What kind of magic have I gotten myself into?

Amidst the dense jungle, I find a broken highway, and a line of telephone poles with nothing on them, scrapped for the copper inside. There are African men and women, thousands walking. A woman carries a bushel of plantains on her head, making it look practically weightless, almost like it’s been enchanted. A man is being stopped at a checkpoint by a soldier in green camouflage, no older than 12, an AK-47 under his arm as he checks papers and peers my way with a murderous gaze.

As I contemplate how asking for directions might play out, I decide on the safer option and go off the beaten path, wandering through a forest of rubber trees all in a row. I now gather this is some kind of unmaintained tree farm, equipped with an abandoned Firestone factory. Feeling rather lost, I notice through the bushes a small but lively village next to a building named “Phoebe Hospital”. 

There, amongst the African children, it’s the little boy from my dream. He's got some sugar cane in his hand, eating it right off the stalk, trying to learn how to pronounce his new nickname “Qui-que-le-Lon,” which they tell him means “little white boy.” He laughs, embracing his new name. They're teaching him to play soccer with a well-worn, twice-patched ball, the only chicken in the village outrunning him as he attempts to keep up. This is getting quite a laugh out of the other children. He moves clumsily, doesn’t even really understand the rules, but the children smile at his efforts, delighted by his willingness to learn. 

A distant shout cuts through the air. “Over here, Josh.” I look over and see none other than Mayor Salamander's parents, looks like they’re on a mission trip. His Father is beckoning him over.

He asks the boy like a used car salesman, “Want something from these woodcarvers? Why don’t you pick out a gift for your brothers since they couldn’t be here.”

The two Liberian men identify themselves as honest Christian businessmen. They beam as they showcase their goods for the little boy. “Whatever you want,” his father says. “I talked him down to 50 J.J.’s for 5 carvings. It’s a good deal, I think.”

The boy examines their well polished carvings. “They look good,” he says politely, “but not for me,” 

The woodcarvers assure him, “Like we told your parents, you don’t need to worry about anything we have for sale. But you have to be careful around here; some woodcarvings have bad spirits. Don’t buy from anyone but us. No magic in our goods. Only for decoration.”

The little boy notices the men’s hands were lacking any calluses. He says with doubt “And how would you know? I don’t even think you carved these.” Running off without another word to attempt to play the game of soccer again, or “football” as they once again correct him on the name of the game.

His parents, however, bought woodcarvings from the dealers, unaware of the magic they had invited into their souls.

“This will look great in our home, and let everyone know we make a difference.” the dark magic making them feel all special. Little did they know, they had just cursed themselves with a dangerous and powerful spirit—the spirit of pride.

The little boy, however, was wise enough not to judge the woodcarvers or their goods based on how nice they looked on the outside. The creations the men claimed to have made were in reality, products of slave labor. 

I watch him playing again, peeling his sugar cane stalk with his teeth, and sharing happily with the other boys. He has an out-of-place confidence in this environment, as if he’s already used to being in the wild.

Later that night at Phoebe Hospital, the generator starts, and the lights flicker in the darkness as an old man walks to the missionaries' compound. He is a spirit carver who had envisioned a sale was about to happen with these new visitors. For his people, the word “sale” implies medicine. You might be tempted to see a man like him as a door-to-door salesman, but he is here to heal sickness, like a doctor on call.

He wraps on the screen door, looking determined, yet a little nervous.

Inside, the little boy is sitting, playing a guitar for the children who are lining up to listen to his off-pitch tune, but they’re enjoying it because he’s really putting his heart into it. Hearing the knock on the screen door, the little boy jumps up. “I’ll get it!” He says enthusiastically, setting down the guitar.

“No, I’ll get it, Josh. You can’t be too careful, little guy. Liberia is still in civil war. There are kids your age out here, right now, who wouldn’t hesitate to line up and execute us and this entire village. You need to stay inside at all times, especially at night,” the tall missionary scoffs, wondering why these Salamanders brought a child here. He signals more men over as he talks through the screen door. 

“What do you want?” 
The tall missionary asks.
The old man’s eyes are bloodshot and wild. He gestures to come in, not understanding any English. The missionaries cautiously allow it.

Looking for the right spot, he scans the room and unfolds a tattered red cloth. 

He doesn’t boast as many goods as the decorative woodcarvers. Among his offerings, only two objects: a slingshot, crudely carved, and the other item he held in his hand, a small black stone.

The slingshot has been enchanted with the spirit of Tutu. This is his prize goods for sale, ensuring a good life.

The other item the old man carries in his hand, a small black pebble, was not for sale; it was a heavy burden with a price of its own. Burning inside it is the ancient Gbigbona, a bold yet restless spirit. Although powerful, it looks incredibly hard for him to control. Not sure if this power is a blessing or a curse. Either way, it means a very tragic and difficult journey ahead for the one who carries it.

""Can I get the slingshot? I really like it."" The little boy asks, feeling the power of the woodcarving resonating with him.

""How much does he want for it?"" 
Father Salamander asks the translator. ""He says that item is for sale. 10 J.J.’s.""

""Tell him I’ll give him 5.""
The translator replies, ""I’m afraid he says that this is spirit medicine. No barter for medicine."" 

Father Salamander examines the crude, uneven woodwork on the slingshot, throwing it back on the ground.

""No. That’s too much, Josh. It’s crap.""

The old carver didn’t understand the words he had said, but understood the spirit of men, and the intention of these missionaries revealed itself to the old man’s wild eyes, who could now see their hearts were bathed in self-righteousness and judgment.

The old man stood up, gazing at all the missionaries, and slowly, very intentionally places the small black pebble on the table—quietly leaving the missionaries and their negative energy behind. 

The missionaries felt a spiritual attack had happened upon them, staring at the stone on the table. 

""It’s evil.""

""Yeah, I don’t know, maybe we should pray. And then cast it out, in the name of Jesus!"" 

""Yes, let’s do that."" 

The missionaries spoke their fake language known as ""speaking in tongues,"" holding their hands over the stone, but they’re not doing anything.

Seriously, nothing is happening. It’s all silly talk.

Picking up the stone revealed the weight was off for a small pebble, making them tremble in fear. So together, as a group, they cast the stone out into the night, blurting out more prayers in their nonsensical language.

But the little boy felt the pull of the black, ancient magic all night.

He waited until the village was fast asleep, then carefully crawled out of his mosquito net, ensuring he didn't wake anyone. He crept to the screen door and slipped outside, where he found the stone glowing in the tropical moonlight.

It reminded him forever of the deep sadness in this war-torn country, brought here supposedly to help others, but his parents were picking and choosing who deserved their so-called charity.  

As he sits in the night alone, a boa constrictor creeps out of the bush.

I ask him, “What am I supposed to do now?” 

He’s closing his eyes. I’m being pulled away. The world is being turned upside down. I’m being transported back. “No! Not yet! I was just getting used to the humidity!” I shout as I begin fading away from the jungle.

Coming back towards the light, I find myself back in the park, lying by the glinting waters of the pond, the sound of the sump pump at Trinity bringing me back to reality. As I jump up, getting out of the path of the runoff heading from the church, I see a familiar face sitting there in the lawn. The little boy is out in the park, older now, wearing a big straw cowboy hat, pulling the weeds. I walk up and sit beside him. He can feel my presence and speaks. “I can’t see you, but I know you’re here with me. I’m sorry, but I brought you here because I need someone to talk to. 2020 has not been my year.” He starts to quietly sob. “I’m going through a lot right now, but my mom was gracious enough to give me a job. I have to pull all these dandelions before high noon; we can’t use chemicals here at Prayer Park, every weed has to be pulled by hand. No shortcuts around here, you see.”

He continues to work through the tears. He seems like a man trying to pick up the pieces of a shattered life like broken glass in the dirt, the way he is attacking those weeds, it seems rather personal. He muses, “You know, if you don’t get the dandelions by their roots, they will just keep coming back stronger. Every day, the parks director has me pull these dandelions, and I’ve told him a million times, I just can’t get all of the roots—so he wanted me to pop off the heads instead. 'It’s more vital that we keep the appearance of a nice lawn,” He imitates, and continues. “But I don’t listen, I attack those dandelions with everything I’ve got. You can’t let them win. Even if you can never get rid of all the weeds, after a long day, you look inside your bucket, and when you see all the roots you removed, it still feels good to know you’ve done your very best.'” He reaches deep into the soil at the dandelion he’s been digging around for a few minutes, then slowly pulls out the entire root system. “Ha! You see, it’s just that easy.”

I ask, “Josh, can you hear me?” 

He doesn’t reply. I ask again,

“Little white boy? Are you there?”

Still no reply. 

I try one last time, this time shouting, “Qui-que-le-Lon!” 

Now he’s standing, looking directly at me with a firm expression, the black stone burning in his hand. The face that once was nothing more than a scared young man has been replaced with a fierce, intense gaze; there's a wild madness in his eyes that reminds me of the spirit carver. He speaks to me in a completely different tone than before—deeper, more confident, with an assertiveness that drips with a soft, warm tone.

“I’m the mayors long lost brother, and I’ve been quiet for too long.”

He told me how his parents really operated their youth ministry program. He said that he watched his father giving the kids within the youth group money and telling them to keep it a secret, recognizing the same type of grooming behavior from his dark childhood. 

“So I told him, ‘You’re not supposed to keep secrets with kids,’ and he got very upset with me. He yelled, ‘I can do whatever I want, Josh! We own you. You work for us, you live on our property because we are good people. You need to find somewhere else to go. You have three days!’.”

He explains, “my family left me out in the cold, with nowhere to go. Even my brother abandoned me, drove by as I was looking for a place to stay without ever once thinking to ask if I was okay. It was easy for him to turn his back on me. Sorry to say, I wasn’t surprised that he would turn his back on the whole city.”

He looks at the stone burning in his hand.

“I can’t hold onto all of this any longer, that’s why I needed you. So, whatever happens next, it’s your move, witch.”

Tossing the black pebble with a throw lacking in any skill or athleticism. He may be a mysterious and powerful wizard, but he throws like a little bitch. I pick up the rock off the ground and place it in my pocket. “So what do I do with it? Does it come with a manual?”

He explains, “The Gbigbona will show you the inner demon that each Salamander hasn’t confronted. Then they have no choice but to face their mortal enemy.”

“Who’s the Salamanders' mortal enemy?”

“Themselves,” he says with a far-off stare.

I ask, “Why me?”

He responds, “Because your magic is strong enough to take my family’s hooks out of this city for good. Oh yeah, ask my mom about their last trip to Juarez.”

And just as soon as he came, Josh’s spirit fades away. 

Turning around, I notice out of the corner of my eye in the alley, taking out the office garbage is a face I just saw, in a different place and a different time, but I know that wretched stone of a face.

It's that evil mother of a Salamander, and she’s looking directly at me. She’s kind of scarier in person than she was in my dream. Her hands are on her hips, her lips pursed tighter than a drum. Looks like she has something on her mind. 

She looks me down, sizing me up before she speaks. “You people aren’t welcome here.” 

“You people? What do you mean by you people, lady?” I ask, standing tall. 

“I mean Witches. I am ministering to the children today; we are going to pull the weeds in the park; they don’t need your sickness here. You have to leave; you’re not the kind of influence we want on our youth group, bud.”

I reply, taking offense.
“Bud? Who are you calling bud, you parasitic little worm?” 

She smirks in disbelief, “you don’t fool me, you’re that Black Hills Witch everyone’s talking about, you’ve been putting ideas in the kids' heads. I want you to know, your presence isn’t welcome. I want you out of here, missy. So, get out! Shoo!” Flinging her garbage bag at me. 
I dodge her pathetic attack, and I conjure up the name from her past, “Qui-que-le-Lon says hi.”

Her self-righteous demeanor shatters in front of me; my words are like splinters under her skin.

Her face turns pale, her shoulders lean in, and her hands ball up into fists.

“Leave. I have the whole youth group coming soon. I don’t want to have to call the police.” 

Pacing back to the church, I pull out my wand, and with a flick of the wrist, turn her back around and glide her towards me. I’m not letting her get away that easy.

As her helpless body floats in front of me, I ask,

“What kind of role models are you and your husband? Have you guarded those children, protected them? Kept them from harm?”

Her silence says a lot, but we can do better than that, can’t we?

A truth spell should get to the bottom of this mystery. “Liar, liar, pants on fire, a tale of truth is what I require.”

She’s completely under my spell.
“Now, what happened on the last mission trip to Juarez?” I ask her point blank.

She holds back the urge to speak but can’t help herself. Blurting out, “My husband drove the kids to buy alcohol and might have been under the influence. Also, he was letting the underage youth on the bus drink for the first time, feeling like it was a rite of passage he had the authority to offer them, so long as they promised to keep everything a secret.” She snaps out of it, realizing the weight of her own words. 

“I think a witch got what she wanted,” I say, releasing her to sift through the cobwebs of lies she’s told.

She walks away with what could only be described as a pissed off Karen glare. At the last moment, she turns her head to try and get the last word in.

“You don’t understand how Josh is. He’s dangerous. Don’t say I didn’t try to warn you.”

“Consider me warned,” I reply. 

I wait for that damn woman to walk away, watching her fighting an internal battle, the stone in my pocket getting heavier. It’s the  Gbigbona. As I hold the pebble, I can see in her mind. Theres a looming darkness hiding. As she leaves my sight, I recognize her ugly face now; the spirit of a covert narcissist follows her like a shadow along the walls of the church.

So this mayor credits his parents for being the foundation of his faith and family values. 

What they must have really taught him was how to use religion as a mask to hide the family’s demons. His parents must be so proud. I wonder what other sins this stone could reveal. Mayor Salamander, I hope you're ready, because you’re next.

I have spent countless hours scouring reddit, YouTube, twitter, the internet etc trying to find out what is wrong with me or someone who has experienced the same things I have, but I have found no joy in doing so. This will be a lengthy post, and I greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it and respond or can give any advice or insight. 
First, I will need to give some context and share some details that may seem irrelevant, but I think they could have played a role in why I am experiencing the problems I am experiencing today.
In June 2024, I went to Thailand with my friends for a month, on one of the first nights I was there I had sex with a girl from Thailand (not a ladyboy or sex worker btw) without a condom. When telling my friends after, they tried scaring me by telling me I was going to get an std. This started to put fear in the back of my mind for the rest of the trip. Before going to Thailand, we had gotten our vaccines for Typhoid and Hep-A. I had remembered one of my friends saying that one of the people administering his vaccines saying it wasn’t necessary to get Hep-B vaccine, however, don’t have unprotected sex with locals as there is a higher chance of getting it there than it would back home. Once I remembered this, I started to fear I had contracted Hep-B even though I had no symptoms of it at all or any of std. About two weeks later, before going out for dinner we had some down time where everyone was either sleeping or just resting before going out for food. I remember during this downtime I was alone with my thoughts and began to convince myself I had Hep-B (I didn’t have it I’m just an idiot). I had really convinced myself that I had it and began to fear the worst. I experienced this sinking feeling in my chest (never experienced before) 2 or 3 times when thinking my life was ruined, I have this virus that can’t be cured. I wasn’t visibly in fear or panicking just in my head I was, my friends were unaware that I had convinced myself into believing this nor could they see it from the outside in. We then went out for dinner in an Italian restaurant like we did most nights. This is when my first problem happened…
I ordered pizza like normal and after taking a bite or two of the pizza my throat started to tighten up, making it hard to breathe. I was confused when this happened as I have never experienced this sensation ever before in my life, it was scary and worrying, it was like I was having an allergic reaction to the pizza, a food I have eaten my whole life, I also don’t have any food allergies. This feeling of my throat tightening up and difficulty breathing lasted for about 3 hours (not a panic attack). I thought this might be a once off thing and went out that night drinking and had no further issues. I then woke up the next morning and started experiencing the same problem, my throat would physically tighten up and make it hard to breathe, usually lasting 3 hours at a time and was happening several times a day. This continued for the rest of the holiday and for weeks when I got back home. 
I must note when I came home, I did a std test and had no std. I believe that night when I had convinced myself I had Hep-B and got these sinking sensations in my chest is what triggered everything I have experienced since as strange as it sounds. I believe I somehow messed up my body that day by believing that I had Hep-B and my life was ruined. Even though I did a std test and I know that I don’t have it, all my problems haven’t went away. It also seems that food triggers these issues, I have since been to an immunologist and identified I don’t really have any food allergies yet food I used to eat all the time, like pizza, triggers and almost allergic like reaction. Even foods like chewing gum and coffee trigger these strange reactions. I don’t have histamine intolerance or MCAS. I don’t have EoE or MS. I also have no soy allergy but when I eat soy sauce my throat tenses up. I also have no peanut allergy, but the smell of peanuts makes my throat tense up as well. These are all food I had never had any issues with prior to when this first happened in the Italian restraint that night. It’s almost as if my body believes all these foods are a danger to it even though consciously, I know they are not. What’s also strange is I react to almost all supplements such as omega 3 capsules and antihistamines, probiotics, anything you can think of I react to. All of which I had never had problems with before. Smoking and vaping also make my causes these reactions as well as drugs. I have obviously since stopped eating, smoking, vaping or doing anything that triggers a reaction

It’s been almost six months from when this first happened and I am still left with no answers as to what’s wrong, I also started to experience a lot of other problems I’m about to mention too on top of this which are problems I have never experienced before this first happened.
On top of my throat physically tightening up and making it hard to breathe, I started to experience these strange neurological symptoms in my hands, face, mouth, tongue head and body in general. The symptoms varied from tingling, cold, sometimes numb like and some other foreign sensations that are hard to put into words. I also have had problems with my vison where when I walk static objects like poles and trees are bouncing up and down.

Please can anyone help me? Id like to thank anyone who took the times to read this and if anyone has experienced anything like this, please let me know! I am at a loss, and I don’t know if this will ever end. If anyone has any questions, please ask I will respond very quickly.

1hgqtao,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLawyers/comments/1hgqtao/ca_local_government_issues_thoughts/,[CA] Local Government Issues - Thoughts?,"Hey there my favorite internet website, thanks for reading.  Sorry, no TLDR on this one. 

40M, California.  Combat veteran (3x) and served in local government for the last ~10 years.  

Summary:

Earlier this year, I worked for local government agency A.  I applied with local government agency B, went through the multiple interviews, completed their required physical and background check, and was offered the position.  

I accepted with B, they provided me a start date, had misc staff reach out to welcome me, and provided me login information to begin in-processing.  I provided my two weeks notice to A.  

One week into the TWN, B rescinds the offer.   Naturally, I’m freaking TF out. I ask to rescind my resignation with A, they decline (they are not required to per the agencies policies).  Now I am beyond freaking TF out for the reasonable reasons - rent, food, ability to care for my child, the emotional toll thinking of being homeless (again). 

Details:

I had previously applied and interviews multiple times with B due to existing relationships with leadership and other staff. Plus it’s where I live - I want to serve the community I live in.  I had a personal / professional relationship with Manager 2 (Manager 1 is the “top non elected official”) - we had coffee socially distant coffee together and worked on multiple high-level projects.

In a previous interview, I disclosed an issue with a former employer (government agency C - nothing illegal or immoral, just a difference of opinion based on SOP and policy) that became public and resulted in me getting blasted by the local newspaper.  I disclosed this newspaper article and the issue with agency A.   I also relayed that I was previously homeless (unhoused) about 10 years ago l  - she (Manager 2) shared her brother had faced that issue too throughout his life. 

During the final interview for the most recent position, I again disclosed the newspaper article and issue.  She (Manager 2) said it wasn’t an issue. Further, they (Manager 2 plus representative from Human Resources) asked if I could start basically immediately (before finishing background check), I said no as I wanted it to pass background (based on the newspaper article) and give agency B a proper two weeks notice. Fun fact: I had property rights to my job with agency B. 

Long story long: they rescinded the offer.  The reason the hiring manager gave on the phone was Manager 1 didn’t want to jeopardize the agencies reputation and relationship with C.  She said they don’t normally include internet searches of their candidates, but since they knew about this issue, they did.  She apologized when I asked why this want discussed as part of the background process BEFORE sending me of the offer letter, start date, etc. 

Additionally, I followed up, in writing, requesting they provide this in writing. Agency B stated “they were rescinding the offer and going in a different direction.”

I am working through the correct processes but wanted to share (get it off my chest and receive feedback).  I have followed the process outlined in the Government Code (§ 900) for submitting a claim against agency B - they rejected it (no shock there).


I now have the right to sue letter (Civil Court) and believe I have the evidence to support my case.  A special relationship was established and they had a duty of care to me, especially since they had prior knowledge of the issue I told them about. They failed to follow their SOPs, to supervise their HR staff in performance of duties, and should have reasonably known this would cause harm to me by rescinding their offer. 

 Personal Injury - Negligence (CACI 400)
Negligent Supervision
Gross Negligence
Negligence Per Se
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. 

I am building a case (details, documents needed, timelines, witnesses to be called, etc.) and believe there is existing case law that supports my claims (A Whitson v Oakland USD, Rodgers v Kemper, White v County of Orange, etc.).

Alright, so apparently I’ve become an anthropologist overnight. I’ve been spending exactly two afternoons in Brooklyn parks and coffee shops, and I’ve cracked the code: I can now tell if you’re a newly-arrived migrant or just an NYC transplant trying to pass as interesting.

Here’s the thing. There’s a distinct vibe. Migrants have an actual destination—they walk with purpose. You, however, just wandered into Greenpoint because a blog told you about a “hidden gem” bagel shop. Migrants wear practical shoes—boots that could survive a warzone. You’re wearing $400 leather loafers that scream “I just moved here from a WeWork.” Migrants are out here surviving. You’re out here looking for “community.”

Yesterday, I overheard some guys from Venezuela cracking jokes while absolutely destroying a game of soccer. Meanwhile, Chad from Portland is on the sidelines in his Patagonia vest, debating whether he’s emotionally ready to commit to indoor climbing season.

It’s all love—this is New York, after all. Everyone’s a migrant here, whether it’s from Queens to Brooklyn, Ohio to Bushwick, or Guatemala to Sunset Park. I’m just saying, you can feel who’s here because they need to be and who’s here because a vibe told them to come.

Anyway, shout out to the real migrants, y’all are hustling out here. The rest of us are just trying to figure out how to survive the brunch lines.",1,1734486322.0,u_Vegetable-Ant-879,0,1.0,False
1hgqqqo,https://www.syracuse.com/news/2024/12/ny-prison-guards-brutally-threatened-humiliated-and-sodomized-inmates-in-raid-judge-rules.html,"NY prison guards brutally threatened, humiliated and sodomized inmates in raid, judge rules","Marcy, NY — Dozens of New York prison guards and their supervisors brutally attacked a dorm full of unsuspecting inmates — punching, kicking and sodomizing prisoners and destroying their personal items — as misguided revenge for a suspected attack on a corrections officer that never happened, a judge ruled this month.

In the 2016 rampage by at least 31 prison guards at the Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, Oneida County, guards jumped on an inmate’s back like a trampoline. Another guard kicked an inmate’s head like a football. Two were sodomized and one was touched sexually, a state Court of Claims judge ruled.

One inmate testified that an officer tore up 50 family photos in front of him, while another said guards poured food all over his legal paperwork, destroying it. Some guards at the medium-security prison hit the inmates with fire extinguishers.

Inmate Brian Kelly said he was “scared to death” as he lay on the floor in a prone position, his mind in fight or flight mode while knowing he couldn’t do either.

Inmate Matthew Petrillo recalled being struck in the head with a locker door and later kicked in the side “like a football.”

Before the attack, many guards removed or hid their nametags to hide their identities.

At least 29 inmates sued the state. Court of Claims Judge Anthony Brindisi ruled in their favor Dec. 2. Now the inmates have to go through another trial to determine money damages for the misconduct.

The guards indicated they were reacting to their colleague’s injury, which happened three days before the brutal raid, according to court testimony. But he wasn’t attacked by inmates. The officer had actually fallen on his own, causing a head injury that left him unconscious with blood on the floor, the state’s internal investigation later revealed.

In fact, the inmates later accused of the attack were the ones who summoned help after Officer Nicholas Kahl fell, the investigation found.

To the angry guards, those facts didn’t matter, Brindisi found in a scathing decision that held the guards and their superiors responsible for the beatdown.

Even at the time of the July 6, 2016, raid, the inmates under suspicion for Kahl’s injuries had already been moved off the floor, meaning that the ensuing abuse targeted inmates who had nothing to do with the incident at all, a state investigator noted.

Still, the 30-plus prison guards stormed the dorm that July morning. They abused, stripped, kicked and humiliated the 28 inmates as punishment for acts none of them committed, Brindisi wrote in his decision.

“Unlike the 4H dorm at Mid-State, where the correctional staff had their way with my defenseless clients,” the inmates’ lawyer, Glenn Miller, told syracuse.com | The Post-Standard today. “Judge Brindisi’s courtroom provided a level playing field for all of the parties, and as a result justice was served.”

Brindisi’s 101-page decision means the inmates who were attacked can keep fighting for New York to pay for the injuries inflicted on them.

The decision paints the inmates as providing credible testimony of the atrocities, while casting doubt on claims by the guards that they didn’t do anything wrong or see anything amiss.

Here’s how the attack unfolded:

Early that summer morning, a busload of guards pulled up outside the dorm and began their attack, according to testimony.

The inmates, “by and large, consistently described how officers stormed the dorm that morning, indiscriminately kicking, punching, stomping, or slamming them one by one as they proceeded through the dorm,” the judge wrote.

Inmate Jeremy Dame described officers jumping on his back “like a trampoline.” Alec Hammond described being kicked in the mouth “like a football punt.” A fellow inmate independently verified that Hammond was kicked “like a freaking football.”

Several inmates testified that guards used racial epithets, including the N-word, and made it clear that the brutality was in response to the guard’s injuries days earlier.

In two cases, guards in the raid stuck unknown objects up inmates’ rectums, the judge found, while saying things like: “How does it feel to be helpless, like my officer was helpless?”

In another case, Officer Ryan O’Neil ordered Dame to give a urine sample. When he wasn’t able to urinate, O’Neil had him pull his underwear down to his ankles. Then the officer flicked the inmate’s penis, taunting him.

“‘Come on there, little guy, we just need a few drops,’” Dame testified the guard, O’Neil, had said.

Pictures of Dame’s injuries from the raid — in which a guard jumped on him like a trampoline — were taken that day, including abrasions that he testified were caused by a guard’s boot marks.

Some of the actions were clearly intended to inflict humiliation, such as pulling all the inmates out of bed and ordering them into a prone position on the floor, where they were covered in mayonnaise, ketchup, coffee, creamer, syrup, honey, peanut butter, soup and other items.

The state investigation also found that officers cut the phone line and the TV cable, though it’s unclear why, according to the judge’s decision. Many of the 31 officers identified as part of the raid either covered or removed their nametags, the investigation found.

Guards used fire extinguishers to break open inmates' lockers, the investigation found. Inmates also accused officers of hitting them with fire extinguishers while they were on the ground.

A state investigator found several missing fire extinguishers hidden in a different building with damage consistent with smashing locks.

Several prison guards were disciplined and Mid-State’s superintended resigned after the state investigation. Their exact punishments for all guards found responsible in an internal investigation were not recounted in the Brindisi decision.

Numerous prison guards testified before Brindisi during a state Court of Claims trial last year.

None of them admitted to attacking inmates or seeing anyone who did.

O’Neil, the officer accused of flicking an inmate’s penis, claimed that he did not pay any attention to what was going on around him.

“His testimony was that he was looking straight ahead, observing nothing in front of him and nothing to the right or left,” Brindisi noted in his decision finding the state liable.

None of the officers could explain why inmates’ personal possessions were destroyed, how inmates were injured or how a chair was thrown with such force that its four legs ended up embedded in a wall.

The judge ruled that the corrections officers, often called COs, were acting under orders from prison leaders.

“These acts were taken in the midst of approximately 30 COs acting in concert against 28 incarcerated individuals, in the dormitory space, in the course of knocking over furniture, dumping personal items on incarcerated individuals, speaking vulgarities, ordering that incarcerated individuals remain prone on the floor, assaulting them by kicking, hitting, stomping and making statements meant to elicit a feeling of helplessness,” the judge ruled.

Perhaps the judge’s biggest wrath was directed at Sgt. Daniel O’Neil, one of the officers who organized the raid.

An inmate described O’Neil as watching the officers attack and humiliate the inmates with a “proud papa” look, the judge noted.

O’Neil’s son, Ryan, is the one accused of flicking the inmate’s genitals.

Beyond inconsistencies and his role in the affair, Brindisi went after O’Neil’s demeanor in court.

“Daniel O’Neil appeared for his testimony in shorts and a polo shirt, more suited for a round of golf than for testifying in a judicial proceeding,” Brindisi wrote in his decision. “His demeanor throughout his testimony was marked by utter disdain, arrogance, and condescension, all of which reflected a blatant lack of respect for the court and the process.”

The elder O’Neil was suspended two months and placed on probation for another 18 months following the state investigation into the raid, Brindisi noted.

In the end, the judge ruled that the state was 100% responsible for the acts committed by the prison guards that day.

“... There was no justification for the excessive and unreasonable use of force against the claimants on the date in question,” Brindisi wrote.

A trial to determine how much the state owes each of the 28 inmates will be held in coming months.",33,1734486298.0,upstate_new_york,3,1.0,False

1hgqp4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1hgqp4r/kitchen_appliances_tripping_20a_afci_breaker/,Kitchen Appliances Tripping 20A AFCI Breaker ,"Hi all,

For starters - I am by no means an electrician.  I’ve learned more about AFCI and GFCI breakers in the last 3 hours than I’d care to admit.  

I have a nespresso virtuo coffee machine that trips my square D 20 AMP AFCI breaker about 1/4 of the way through the machine’s process, every time.  I plugged it into a different circuit (also 20A square D AFCI in the bathroom) and it tripped that breaker as well.  I assumed it was the machine, until i started having the same issues with an air fryer when plugged into a separate circuit in the kitchen (same breaker style).  

This is a new home, ~2 years old.  Had this problem since I moved in (1.5 years ago).  

It leaves me with 3 questions… 

1) could these appliances be drawing too much power too quick, causing the AFCI breaker to treat it as an arc and trip?  If so… wouldn’t that be a common issue with this model of espresso machine? Cannot find a repeated issue anywhere.  

2) if it’s not an issue with the appliances, how would I know if it’s an issue with the wiring and/or breaker itself?  

3) would it be dangerously stupid to try and run them on a regular 20A breaker (not AFCI/GFCI)? 

Any advice here would CURE me of a headache! ",3,1734486158.0,AskElectricians,6,1.0,False

Alright, folks, hear me out. I’ve recently discovered the ultimate Brooklyn pastime: counting wool hats.

You know what I mean. It’s December, the temps drop below 50°F, and suddenly every dude in Brooklyn is rocking a wool hat like it’s a rite of passage. Walk down Bedford Ave? Wool hats. Prospect Park on a brisk morning? Wool hats. Waiting for the G train? A sea of wool hats.

I started counting for fun the other day while waiting for my overpriced oat milk latte (judge me, IDGAF), and within 10 minutes, I counted 53 wool hats. That’s 5.3 wool hats per minute. These aren’t just hats—they’re statements:
	•	The Slouchy Beanie: “I’m effortlessly cool, but actually I’m sweating under this thing.”
	•	The Tight Knit Skullcap: “I have opinions about coffee.”
	•	The Oversized Fisherman: “I don’t fish, but I shop at REI sometimes.”

Anyway, I’ve started logging this in a notebook, and I’m weirdly committed to this new sport. I’m wondering:
	1.	Is this niche hobby going to make me famous?
	2.	Should I make it competitive? Like, teams of two on opposite ends of the L train?
	3.	Are there even non-wool hats in Brooklyn this time of year?

Let me know if you want in on this groundbreaking cultural movement. Or if you’ve spotted any particularly rare hats (bonus points for colors like neon orange or patterns that scream “I knitted this myself at a workshop in Gowanus”).

But basically, everything was going great, we saw each other frequently, she had introduced me to her family (I spent most of Thanksgiving weekend with them), and had even remarked a few times how it felt like we'd been going out for a lot longer. That said, for the prior week I had been feeling she was a little bit off, maybe slightly distant, even though she insisted that she was just having stress with work. We had dinner (really nice dinner) that night, but when we were walking back to hers I could still feel something was off and so I basically asked ""how are you feeling about us, are you still interested in me?"" At first, she said yea, for sure, of course! 

But then she went a bit further, saying that she had been feeling a bit weird, and it might have been because it had only been half a year since she had broken up with her ex of 1 year, but she admitted that she was feeling a bit odd. Then, we got to hers, and she basically starts telling me that there's like a ""a wall"" between how she wanted to feel in the relationship and how she was feeling, saying that she didn't feel right just leaving it as is, and she wanted some time alone to figure out how she was feeling. I (stupidly) wanted to try and talk to her about it, and she started telling me that she just wasn't feeling the same spark she had initially, and didn't know if it was a problem with her, but wanted to figure it out on her own. She said that she ""wanted 'us' to work out in the future"" and that I had all the qualities of a person she wanted to be with, but she couldn't shake that ""wall"" feeling. She also said she still really enjoyed spending time with me, and was still attracted to me, but again, that wall feeling, and that she wanted to feel differently at this point in the relationship. I left at this point, and she called me later that night to tell me she wanted to break up. I suggested that we basically start from scratch, go on dates, as friends, with no expectations, which she agreed to as long as I didn't expect the feelings to return for sure (I'm seriously regretting this part and likely won't pursue this avenue), I suggested no contact for a week and a half. Then four days later she texts me to see how I'm doing..... Since then, I've been no contact with her (going on about a month now).

 I'm struggling so much, because this is so flagrantly an avoidant, and a pretty nasty avoidant discard at that, but I can't help feeling that I want her back, and that if I could talk to her about it we could figure it out and make it work. I know this is crazy, but it's been a month, and I'm thinking that in two months if she doesn't reach out I might ask if she wants to grab a coffee and see if I can restart the spark....

1hgqjzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Holistichealing4HSV/comments/1hgqjzm/checkin_in/,Checkin in,"Felt like writing today. Where do I begin……

Let’s begin by saying no, I am not cured yet. Since starting Darko’s Self Healers Protocol (raw primal diet + plasma) I was fine for about the last 4 months. Felt amazing inside and out. Last week, I got a nasty outbreak on the back of my thigh which was strange…..

How could all the sudden my outbreaks go from the same area all this time (the genitals) to the back of my leg? Super strange, but after some research and talking to people, it seems that’s just how my body decided to detox. A frequency was off on the back of my leg, so body decided to release toxins there. 

Not even a week later, I just got a breakout again in that same area AND on my genitals…. So yeh, I’m going through it rn. This is the most amount of outbreaks I’ve had since contracting this shit about 1.5 years ago…….

Needless to say, it’s almost hard for me to be upset or angry at this point, even though this is taking much much longer than expected. I’m releasing a ton of toxins rn through my outbreaks, so can’t be too upset. All symptoms are body cleansing itself. Never forget that.

I know you all have heard about frequency healing in Grenada, and yes I believe it works, because all healing is based off the quantum field, frequency. I have a friend who went there about a month ago, and she said it was crazy what the machine told her. It tells you everything wrong with your body, including HSV. And yes, it aligns your frequency and gets rid of everything after several treatments. We’ll know soon for sure once she gets the western blot blood test done.

ANYWAYS…… Still continuing the cure….. Last week was my worse week I’ve had since starting the cure in June. Drank a shit ton of tequila in Miami, had some tacos, some nicotine, drank coffee every morning, oh yeh I was in a bender. Honestly needed that shit after going so fucking hard and being so disciplined all this time.

Sometimes I feel like giving up, but we’ve come too far to give up at this point. Still learning more as we go. Hell, I learned the other day that HSV1 lies within the blood and HSV2 lies within your lymph nodes. Not your nerves like we’ve been told….. this is why HSV1 is easier to get rid of than HSV2 it seems like…..

Crazy how far we’ve come. Since eating nothing but fruits and herbs all of June and July, to eating nothing but raw animal products and heavy amounts of plasma since August. It’s been a wild fuckin ride so far figuring everything out.

Idk if y’all have heard about Military Med Beds, but those ARE real and will be open to the public soon. It’s essentially was Grenada is, frequency healing. It can and WILL heal you within a short period of time from basically anything. 1-2 months if I had to guess. The world is becoming more aware of healing and how we are being poisoned……. The good is taking over the evil.

In conclusion, don’t worry y’all, we WILL get to the bottom of this. Swear on my life I will not leave ANY of you hanging. Like I’ve said, once I’m personally cured I’m going to host a zoom call and reveal my face and tell you guys my whole life story and fucking everything you need to know to cure yourselves. I want to guide everyone so no one has to live with this demon we call herpes. 

I know many of you have been suicidal over this. You think your life is over and you’ll never find a soulmate. I’ve felt like I’ve almost lost my manhood and dignity having this fucking shit. Everytime I see a pretty girl, I always have the thought of her never wanting me because of what I have, and never getting intimate with another female ever again. Because why would someone want a guy with fucking genital herpes? Never being able to have sex and produce children with someone. Life almost seems pointless sometimes. 

But this is not the end. This is my mission to fucking glory, conquering what we have been told is “ impossible” by our health leaders who don’t know fucking shit about the human body. Lying to us. The propaganda that’s been fed to use for decades. Fuck those mother fuckers. 

This game we call life can be tough….. Over come your fears and worries, and anything is possible. I’ve accepted that I have herpes and the fact that I will not talk to a female or ever have sex again till I complete my mission and cure this shit and help the world do the same, so help me God.

As always, stay disciplined everyone.

I'm 33f on a 6 week trial of 25mg Foquest (methylphenidate aka Concerta). 2.5 weeks in.  At about the 10 day mark I started to get headaches around 2pm until bedtime. This is accompanied by extreme fatigue in the evenings. Not sleepy, just tired and low energy. 

Tylenol helps with the headache but I can't seem to kick the exhaustion. 

I've looked up other posts but I haven't found an answer. I see posts suggesting drinking more water and eating more protein but I already do this
 I live a gymrat lifestyle so I regularly drink 3-4 liters of water, sleep 7+ hours, eat 100+ g of protein (usually closed go 130-150g), etc.  no other meds. I do take magnesium and creatine supplements for fitness reasons. 

Not a coffee drinker but I do have some in pre workout (50mg) and a large black tea (100-150mg) during the day. 

I do have season affective disorder and this being the least daylight all year (dark by 4pm where I live), I'm wondering if my exhaustion and headache is actually a symptom of that. I haven't had it in previous years this badly. I take vitamin D supplements and have light therapy for my SAD. 

I have a check in with my doctor in 3 weeks but in the meantime I was wondering if others had experienced this? I'm dreading the holidays because I'm basically catatonic after 4pm so idk how I'm gonna have energy for holiday parties 😩. ",1,1734485287.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

Please help me decide if it is worth it spending $500 on an ""onlay"". Is it the same as crown? Will just onlay be good enough for this tooth? Will it really last for a really long time? No cons at all? I would like to avoid unnecessary cost if I can but I am willing to invest in good quality that will guarantee the integrity of my tooth for like forever. I will loan for it if I can.

My dental insurance will only cover half of it if I go for the porcelain. I believe composite is completely free. Just to be clear, the total cost will be $1100 per tooth but the insurance will only cover half of it. So I will have to pay $550 something. That's still a lot for me.

I believe the one I am going to is a reputable dental clinic. I hope so!

It seems like I am getting cavities on the same teeth that have prior dental fillings already. My question is why. Is that normal? If I am not mistaken, the tooth in picture has a 3 year old filling but I could be wrong!

I am so tired of going to the dentist, it seems like everytime they find cavities to fill every year even though I brush really well and floss. They even tell me I have very good dental hygiene, just need to improve flossing at the very back of my molars above. Why does it seem like I need more fillings more frequently than others ? :( What can I improve about myself other than oral hygiene because I know I am somewhat ok in this and I keep trying to get better.

Thank you for those who will answer.

to add: I am not a smoker, not a drinker and I dont love sugary food. I LOVE coffee, I am a bit iron deficient. I brush and floss once a day.

I (27F) At the time, was invited to go on a girls trip with a few of my friends, and a couple of other girls I didn't really know, other than being mutual friends of mine. 
We had this trip planned for about 6 months and were all told up front we would have to pay $170 per person for our stay for a 3 night 4 day stay. 

I paid my part and proceeded to then purchase things needed for my trip to make travel easier. It was a beach girls trip and I was beyond excited, because the nearest beach to me is around 8 hours away. 

During this time the trip landed on my birthday and my friends birthday (who initially thought of the plan for a trip) which were only a couple days apart but would pass while we were on the trip. 

She later changed the reason for this trip was for ""her birthday trip"" and I was a little confused being that just months ago it was just a simple girls trip. 

She made it a point to keep bringing up that it was for ""HER BIRTHDAY"" & just totally exused that mine was just 2 days after hers. 

I kept fo myself and bought her a birthday gift and saved it for ""the trip"" 

The day comes to travel to the beach resort and we all load up and hit the road. 

We finally get there and we all decide to go eat at a small seafood place on the corner and get back to get ready and enjoy the rest of the sun before night falls. 

The next day we wake up and I order everyone Dunkin' Donuts and coffee and we proceed to carry on about our day. 

Come dinner time, we all get dressed up to go to ""her birthday dinner"" and I do her makeup and hair for her along with some of the other girls (I am a mua). I then get myself dressed and we go. We arrive at the restaurant and all attention is on her and she gets the birthday song and free dessert and all. (Keeping in mind, I can't even enjoy my birthday for not wanting to steal her shine). & (It wasn't even a originally planned bday trip for her until she made it that way) 

I made the comment to the waitress that it was my turn for some dessert and that it too, was my bday. The table got quiet and I look at her and she looks upset at me. I then look at the waitress and say ""I'm just joking, the dessert just looks good"" as she laughs and I do to. 

I excuse myself to go to the bathroom and try to collect myself from feeling embarrassment about wanting to enjoy my birthday as well even though I felt like I couldn't. I'm an adult, and I can handle not being told happy birthday, but I felt ignored and almost found myself not happy on the trip due to giving so much energy into my friend of 20 years whom I thought shared a stronger bond than that with me to not get so upset with me about wanting to celebrate ONE night of my paid trip for myself too. 

We got back to our condo and the tension was high.. everyone went to her room or to their own room and I sat on the balcony listening to the ocean then she comes out and tells me that was rude of me to try and steal the attention and I apologized. 

I feel like I've done all I can do to make her happy including buying her a gift, breakfast, and helping her look good with hair and makeup for her ""dinner"" all while I was just non existent even though she knew we shared birthdays for almost 20 years now. 

Everyone went to their bed, except for me, I was forced to sleep on a very hard pull out couch even though I paid my way just like everyone else, I just went with it and learned at this point, to keep to myself. 

I was relived to get home after the trip and finally felt normal & was able to celebrate my birthday alone! 

We are still ""friends"" to this day, but we aren't as close and don't hang out anymore.

Mind-body problems?,"I need help. I have spent countless hours scouring reddit, YouTube, twitter, the internet etc trying to find out what is wrong with me or someone who has experienced the same things I have, but I have found no joy in doing so. This will be a lengthy post, and I greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it and respond or can give any advice or insight. 
First, I will need to give some context and share some details that may seem irrelevant, but I think they could have played a role in why I am experiencing the problems I am experiencing today.
In June 2024, I went to Thailand with my friends for a month, on one of the first nights I was there I had sex with a girl from Thailand (not a ladyboy or sex worker btw) without a condom. When telling my friends after, they tried scaring me by telling me I was going to get an std. This started to put fear in the back of my mind for the rest of the trip. Before going to Thailand, we had gotten our vaccines for Typhoid and Hep-A. I had remembered one of my friends saying that one of the people administering his vaccines saying it wasn’t necessary to get Hep-B vaccine, however, don’t have unprotected sex with locals as there is a higher chance of getting it there than it would back home. Once I remembered this, I started to fear I had contracted Hep-B even though I had no symptoms of it at all or any of std. About two weeks later, before going out for dinner we had some down time where everyone was either sleeping or just resting before going out for food. I remember during this downtime I was alone with my thoughts and began to convince myself I had Hep-B (I didn’t have it I’m just an idiot). I had really convinced myself that I had it and began to fear the worst. I experienced this sinking feeling in my chest (never experienced before) 2 or 3 times when thinking my life was ruined, I have this virus that can’t be cured. I wasn’t visibly in fear or panicking just in my head I was, my friends were unaware that I had convinced myself into believing this nor could they see it from the outside in. We then went out for dinner in an Italian restaurant like we did most nights. This is when my first problem happened…
I ordered pizza like normal and after taking a bite or two of the pizza my throat started to tighten up, making it hard to breathe. I was confused when this happened as I have never experienced this sensation ever before in my life, it was scary and worrying, it was like I was having an allergic reaction to the pizza, a food I have eaten my whole life, I also don’t have any food allergies. This feeling of my throat tightening up and difficulty breathing lasted for about 3 hours (not a panic attack). I thought this might be a once off thing and went out that night drinking and had no further issues. I then woke up the next morning and started experiencing the same problem, my throat would physically tighten up and make it hard to breathe, usually lasting 3 hours at a time and was happening several times a day. This continued for the rest of the holiday and for weeks when I got back home. 
I must note when I came home, I did a std test and had no std. I believe that night when I had convinced myself I had Hep-B and got these sinking sensations in my chest is what triggered everything I have experienced since as strange as it sounds. I believe I somehow messed up my body that day by believing that I had Hep-B and my life was ruined. Even though I did a std test and I know that I don’t have it, all my problems haven’t went away. It also seems that food triggers these issues, I have since been to an immunologist and identified I don’t really have any food allergies yet food I used to eat all the time, like pizza, triggers and almost allergic like reaction. Even foods like chewing gum and coffee trigger these strange reactions. I don’t have histamine intolerance or MCAS. I don’t have EoE or MS. I also have no soy allergy but when I eat soy sauce my throat tenses up. I also have no peanut allergy, but the smell of peanuts makes my throat tense up as well. These are all food I had never had any issues with prior to when this first happened in the Italian restraint that night. It’s almost as if my body believes all these foods are a danger to it even though consciously, I know they are not. What’s also strange is I react to almost all supplements such as omega 3 capsules and antihistamines, probiotics, anything you can think of I react to. All of which I had never had problems with before. Smoking and vaping also make my causes these reactions as well as drugs. I have obviously since stopped eating, smoking, vaping or doing anything that triggers a reaction

It’s been almost six months from when this first happened and I am still left with no answers as to what’s wrong, I also started to experience a lot of other problems I’m about to mention too on top of this which are problems I have never experienced before this first happened.
On top of my throat physically tightening up and making it hard to breathe, I started to experience these strange neurological symptoms in my hands, face, mouth, tongue head and body in general. The symptoms varied from tingling, cold, sometimes numb like and some other foreign sensations that are hard to put into words. I also have had problems with my vison where when I walk static objects like poles and trees are bouncing up and down.

1hgq1xt,https://i.redd.it/lja1lrfzbi7e1.jpeg,My thoughts after The Decaf Project,"
1. Decaf is inferior to caffeinated original;
My first conclusion. Caffeinated original is  just more well rounded and richer. At this stage this is more of a question about whether I should drink bad coffee versus or not drink it at all? Nowadays when I’m forced to go to Starbucks i order a mint tea…while three decaf techniques were way better than Starbucks coffee for sure, I am leaning towards just not drinking coffee at all after 3pm, rather than drinking decaf, after this project.

2. Amongst the three options i thought Carbonic Natural process was the closest to the unprocessed. It maintained more fruits, acidity and clarity. The second was Swiss Water, while the last was EA for me. 

3. The fact that my choice on decaf technology is quite different to consensus(I think consensus favours EA) shows how subjective our palates are and we shouldn’t let consensus drive our choices.

All my tastings were done through espresso. (Lagom P61, E61)

Of course these are my subjective opinions under unscientific testing conditions so if you disagree, you are right!

Recipes suggest simply grinding the garlic cloves into the oil, heating VERY gently, blitzing in a food processor, and then pouring through cheesecloth.

The cheesecloth will prevent (most) of the solid black garlic chunks from getting into the finished oil, but it won't stop any water that might have gotten out of the garlic.

I don't want any little drops of liquid water (and maybe garlic particulates) sitting at the bottom of the bottle underneath all the oil for various reasons.

I can't dry with heat because it will burn the garlic. When I worked in a lab we would dry our samples by pouring it through a glass funnel lined with a coffee filter packed with anhydrous sodium (I think) sulfate. Anything aqueous would bead up and be trapped by the sulfate, while the solvent (and sample) would pass through the funnel. I dunno if something like that exists for food?

For millions of people managing diabetes or watching their blood sugar levels, every dietary choice matters. Coffee creamer might seem like a harmless addition to your morning brew, but many wonder about its potential impact on blood glucose. Sugar-free coffee creamers have become increasingly popular among health-conscious individuals and those monitoring their blood sugar, but are they truly as safe as they appear? This comprehensive guide will dive deep into the science behind sugar-free coffee creamers and their relationship with blood sugar levels, providing you with essential insights to make informed nutritional decisions.

What Are Sugar-Free Coffee Creamers?

Sugar-free coffee creamers are dairy or non-dairy products designed to provide flavor and creaminess to coffee without traditional sugar content. These products typically use alternative sweeteners to create a palatable taste while reducing overall sugar and calorie intake.

Common Ingredients in Sugar-Free Creamers
• Artificial sweeteners
• Sugar alcohols
• Milk derivatives
• Vegetable oils
• Emulsifiers
• Flavoring agents

How Sugar-Free Creamers May Impact Blood Sugar

Understanding the potential blood sugar effects requires examining the specific ingredients used in these products. While labeled ""sugar-free,"" some creamers can still trigger glycemic responses.

Artificial Sweeteners and Glycemic Response

Research suggests that some artificial sweeteners might unexpectedly influence insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. **Not all sugar substitutes are created equal**, and their impact can vary significantly between individuals.

Key Factors Affecting Blood Sugar:
1. Type of sweetener used
2. Individual metabolic response

1hgprwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1hgprwa/condo_owners_in_theftprone_suburban_neighborhoods/,"Condo Owners in Theft-Prone Suburban Neighborhoods: Where do you store things that ""house-owners"" typically store in their house garage and other storage spaces? Tools, Car Stuff, Home Owner Paperwork, etc.","I've found that a lot of decluttering advice falls into either the (1) apartment or (2) house categories, and I've used ALL the methods to successfully progress (so I'm not new to decluttering and don't need basic newbie help), and so far I've been able to use a lot of this general advice (including most of the r/konmari method up to miscellaneous where this issue comes up).

However, I've noticed that it's hard to find examples of what to do with a large miscellaneous category for condo owners in my situation. Apartment renters don't need to worry about fixing things since they don't own the place they live in, thus most renters don't need to own home maintenance tools and other related supplies such as touch up paint. House-owners have so much storage space in their garages, attics, and other storage areas (perhaps a shed in their backyards), but condo owners don't have backyards and generally aren't allowed to store things including storage furniture to make it look nicer on the balconies (HOA rule).

I live in a suburb with limited useful public transportation so I need a car to get to/from work and thus I need a lot of car stuff. I also store my road bike in my home so it won't get stolen but it's an eyesore (no way to hide it, since it's so big)... 

We're given a little cage in the shared garage area where we can use a combination lock and store a small number of stuff but the other residents who have used those all got their tools and other stuff stolen (suitcases, kids bikes, etc.). The residents who thought we were in a safe suburb and left stuff in their cars got their car windows smashed and trunks rifled through. This has been a problem for the >10 years that I've lived here.

I'm a homeowner, but it's a modern condo, so I don't have the storage or closet space for homeowner specific stuff. I do have a storage coffee table which has hold a a pillow and blanket in case I have a guest... but nothing more. I've tried to look into getting a new couch that has storage but it seems the good brands only do that for the ottoman portion so it won't help substantially as a standalone improvement.

Can people who've figured out some solutions share what's worked for you? TIA.",17,1734483353.0,declutter,10,0.95,False
1hgpr07,https://www.reddit.com/r/GermanRoaches/comments/1hgpr07/how_cold_and_for_how_long_before_they_die/,How cold and for how long before they die,"So I’ve found out my countertop dishwasher and coffee maker are both invaded by German roaches. I’ve literally taken apart the dishwasher but there are definitely spots in between the actual inside compartment and the metal outside that I can’t reach and I’ve seen some getting back inside when I was working on it. I just put both the dishwasher and coffee maker outside and left them there. It was around 6 degrees Celsius all day outside and it’s going to be 1 degree Celcius all night. There is a forecast of Minus 9 degrees Celcius on Thursday. The exterminator is coming tomorrow morning (Wednesday) to treat the apartment (probably just with poison) and I’ve basically flooded my kitchen with all the essential oil I could put my hand on (eucalyptus, peppermint, lavender). So, my actual question is : How long should I leave the dishwasher and coffee maker outside and what temperature does it have to be for me to bring those back inside worry free and knowing that all the roaches that were inside all dead? Should I otherwise just get rid of them even though they are still working and it’s not really an expenditure I can afford just before the Holidays?
