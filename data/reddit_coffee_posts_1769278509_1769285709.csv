1qlxf0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1qlxf0q/church_service/,Church Service,"NOTE: I actually found this incredibly hilarious! 

The current shelter I am staying at requires we attend in-house church service everyday, twice a day. We had the snow storm hit (everybody had been anticipating it for about a week now) so the shelter is at about a full house today (around 300 men), and during first service the VP of Operations of the shelter was our service speaker of the day. 

After the music selection played (allowing enough time for all attendees to gather in) the VP started service off by saying “It’s cold outside, amen?” And the group responded a loud and respectful Amen. Though, I knew by the way he started what we were in for. Following that he says “I won’t be long today because I’m hungry, and I know you all are hungry…Amen?” And everybody says Amen. I chuckled but tried to be respectful so I wrap my scarf around my face to prevent any outbursts, again to be respectful. 

He goes on to say “I normally don’t preach, because I’m the VP of operations here so I’m usually doing something more important but luckily today I have the privilege of preaching to you fine men, Amen?” At this point the Amens from the crowd start to lower and I’m literally biting my tongue to not make a sound. He then goes on to then tell us how he and his wife spent the night here at the shelter with us last night but clarifies how they slept upstairs in the special Pastor’s hotel they have on hand for traveling Pastors that come to guest speak at in-house service, but immediately complains about how uncomfortable the bed is, how awful the coffee is, specifically how the creamer is expired (side note- they serve us black coffee in the morning with no option of creamer or sugar lol) and proceeds to say how he “…actually felt homeless” having to experience a night like that with a little laugh. 

I’m literally 😂😂😂 underneath my scarf at this point. 

He realizes how gouache he sounds and moves on to starting his word for the day. He puts on his glasses, opens the Bible and says “we’ll start in Matthew Chapter 2…but before I get into it I wanna say something…” the Bible closes (nothing biblically related is mentioned from this point)

He says “Do you all know that you’re homeless? Do you all know that you are basically living on the street? Do you genuinely realize you have no where to go?” Goes from that to talking about how he knows he’s going to heaven but because of where we are in life that we will be going to hell; unless we act as children of God. And proceeds explaining that acting as a child of God is “…by volunteering to clean the building, offering to take out the trash, asking to mop or being taught how to blow snow with a snow blower…” and just continues on listing all the cleaning duties the hired staff does. 

Literally for the remainder of service he talked down to the entire group of men, ultimately saying if we’re going to be here the least we can do is the jobs of those they’ve hired to clean and cook so that they wouldn’t have to 😂🤣 By this point anytime he said “…Amen?” Following whatever he said there were crickets in the pughs, but tears streaming down my face from laughter. 

Talk about “motivation” to do better lol",0,1769285369.0,homeless,1,0.5,False
1qlxeg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartopia/comments/1qlxeg1/winter_frost_recipes_coming_jan_31st/,Winter Frost Recipes Coming Jan 31st???,"Ok so with the Winter Event under way we have a few days until January 31st. On this day people are saying we will be obtaining some new ""Limited Timed Items"" such as some recipes and a new crop. So lets get into it a bit.

New Crop : 

Radish - I have not seen or heard anything on if you need a specific Gardening Level to grow this. My guess is probably not as then most people wouldn't be able to experience this especially if it is indeed ""Limited Time""

  
New Ingredient :

Sugar - Now I've seen the videos about Prepping for this event on buying all the ingredients to mass cook all of this and mostly everyone i hear calls it frosting... But we're not 100% sure. Sugar makes a lot more sense but we will have to see after January 31st.

  
New Recipes :

Pancakes - So as you can see in the photos we should be getting 5 new Pancake Recipes needing 1 sugar, 1 milk, 1 egg, and 1 fruit. 

Iced Coffee? - We seem to be getting a new Coffee recipe that will take the sugar into it. My guess on the exact recipe might be 2 coffee , 1 milk , 1 sugar but we will see when it actually launches.

Meat Radish Dish & Creamy Radish Soup - I imagine the names are speculation since just images of the recipes are floating around but needing Milk, Meat, and Butter seem to be the key point to obtain.

https://preview.redd.it/1u27fzxdocfg1.jpg?width=2160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=424c552df61328369fcffa7c7662f5a943e26b3c

So what should you do leading up to the event?

Well as we've been told by the content creators... Stock up on the ingredients mostly the Milk, Butter, Meat, Coffee, and Eggs, if you want to farm up the Fruits to get a head start go for it but i don't see needing to stock up to much. You'll want to make at least 1 of each recipe since imagine it will add to your collection stars for the Cooking Hobby. So that will be at least be worth doing. But do you really need that much saved up??? 

With the Sugar being sold by Massimo in town it's a safe guess we will be only able to get 50 a day just like everything else, but who knows? So having 500 Eggs seems a little pointless if your just going get 50 Sugar a day anyways. 

Same concept with Radish's we have no clue, 1) What gardening level you actually need. 2) How long they will even take. They might be quick between 15 Min - 1 Hour they might be even longer we can only speculate at this point unless the Devs leaks more info.

So knowing all of this plan however you see fit. Since I cook a lot I'll be stocking up cuz I have a lot of money from Mastering Blueberry Jams and starting to work on other Masteries. 

If all of this is indeed ""Limited Time"", I really don't see the need to stock up like its Covid lol if the event runs from January 31st - March 14th chances are the recipes will to, giving you plenty of time to make a bunch of them over the course of the month and a half. 

Now i may be all sorts of wrong maybe the recipes are only here for a week? or maybe there here forever we have no clue. Though if they are permanent or here for a week I'll at least have the ingredients I need just in case. Even if they're Limited after they go away I'll still have plenty of ingredients to make into other dishes as well so it's not a huge waste to stock up a bit just to have something to get you started when they do drop.  

So prep however you see fit guy. Mass horde it all, or go day by day up to you. I won't tell anyone how to play the game, that really just ruins it at that point.

1qlxdst,https://i.redd.it/x3gnn8ljtcfg1.jpeg,Am I doing something wrong or is pour over just not for me?,"Hi all, general noob here with some questions. I recently got this beginner setup (Bodum pour over and gooseneck kettle, Oxo grinder) and no matter what I do it seems like my coffee is coming out too watery. I mostly used a French press before this, so I know it’s not supposed to be as thick and oily as I’m used to, but it feels bland and watery even compared to drip that I would get from a cafe.

I’m wondering if there’s anything obvious that I could be doing wrong. I’ve experimented with different grind settings (6 to 8 out of 15 settings), ratios (went from 16:1 to 14:1 and didn’t taste much of a difference), and filters (mesh and paper), and nothing seems to make a huge difference. I also tried using the beans with my French press and I don’t think the beans are the issue. Is this just how pour over is supposed to come out? ",2,1769285292.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1qlxdl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qlxdl5/supernumerary_part_one_of_a_slowburn/,Supernumerary (Part One of a Slow-Burn Psychological and Body Horror Story),"Sheila stood in front of her bathroom mirror, the fluorescent light flickering with a high-frequency hum that seemed to vibrate against her entire being. She hooked her index finger under her upper lip and pulled. There it was. A new tooth, perfectly formed, stacked neatly atop her central incisor.

What had initially felt like a strange bump in her upper gums had now revealed itself to be a fully formed tooth, comparable in size to the tooth it was directly above. She was thirty-five years old. Her dental development should have been a closed book for over a decade.

“We’re matching!” squeaked a tiny voice. Her five-year-old son, Finn, was tugging at his own lip. A similar protrusion was visible in his small, pink mouth.

“That’s your grown-up tooth,” Sheila said. “Means you’re getting big.”

Her son grinned, then frowned thoughtfully and pointed again. “Are you getting big, too?”

Sheila giggled and rubbed Finn’s curly hair.

Reluctantly, she booked a dentist appointment for Monday.

The week was a slow-motion car crash of condescension and rising pressure. At the office, her boss, a man named Miller who smelled of expensive coffee and stale ambition, leaned over her desk.

“Sheila, these reports are… incomplete. I’m unable to present these to the board. You seem distracted.”

She stared at his mouth while he spoke. She found herself counting his teeth. Thirty-two. A standard, boring set. She felt a surge of irrational, jagged hatred. She wanted to reach across the mahogany desk and rip the precision out of his jaw.

She felt the new tooth click against her upper lip. It was sharp.

At school, Finn stood near the chain-link fence, his back to the brick wall of the gymnasium, as he watched his classmates running around. The other boys didn’t let him play football anymore. His face, once soft and symmetrical, had become a topography of hard ridges and asymmetrical swells.

Suddenly, the football flew through the air and landed hard on Finn’s nose. It stung, but he tried to play it off with a nervous laugh. The boys just stared at him.

""My dad says your face is melting,"" Leo said. He leaned in, peering at the way Finn’s jaw pushed outward at an unnatural angle. ""He says you’re a freak.""

Finn felt a lump in his throat and fought to hold back his tears.

Before the drive home, the world felt too bright. Finn was zoned out, in his own world. Something Sheila usually found charming. Today, it felt like a personal affront.

“Get in the car, Finn. Now,” she barked.

“But I found a rock that looks like—”

“I don't care about the fucking rock!”

The silence in the tiny Chevrolet was thick and uncomfortable. At dinner, when he pushed a piece of broccoli away, she snapped. She stood up, her chair screeching against the linoleum. She shouted until her throat felt raw, until Finn shrank into his seat and sobbed uncontrollably.

Monday. Dr. Tresham’s office. The smell of clove oil and latex reminded her of a funeral home.

“How strange,” muttered Dr. Tresham as he adjusted the overhead light. The heat of the bulb radiated against Sheila’s forehead. “The eruption speed is—”

“Can you remove it?” Sheila’s words were clipped.

“We’ll need a map first. An X-ray to see the root structure. We don’t want to damage the original incisor.”

“So it’s serious?”

“I don’t think so, no,” Tresham offered a smile intended to be reassuring. It wasn't. “Just a rare adult supernumerary. Nothing we can’t handle.”

Sheila left the office with a prescription for ibuprofen and a sense of impending structural failure.

The weekend was a descent.

By Friday night, the pain had progressed from a dull ache to a rhythmic pounding, like a hammer striking an anvil inside her jawbone. She retreated to the bathroom, locked the door, and gripped the edge of the porcelain sink.

Knock. Knock.

The sound vibrated through her skull, amplified by the new bone. It felt like a chisel hitting a nerve.

""Mummy? Are you crying?""

It was Finn. His muffled voice was filtered through the wooden door.

""I’m fine, Finn."" Her words were thick.

""I have my doctor kit,"" he said. The handle rattled. He was trying to help. ""I can give you a check-up. I have the special light!""

Sheila squeezed the porcelain until her knuckles turned the colour of the bathroom tile. The ibuprofen sat unopened on the counter.

""Finn. Leave. Me. Alone.""

""Is your tooth hurting you?"" he persisted. His tone was innocent, ""I can fix it. I’ll be the dentist.""

Sheila yanked the door open. The sudden movement sent a spike of agony through her jaw that felt like a lightning strike. Finn jerked backwards, wide-eyed.

""Shut up!"" she roared. The sound was a wet, grinding snarl.

Finn’s plastic stethoscope clattered to the floor. He stared at her. Not at her eyes, but at her mouth. Her lip had snagged on the new incisor, drawing a thin, bright line of blood.

""You're... you're bleeding."" He whispered.

The anger evaporated, replaced by a cold, metabolic shame.

""Go to your room,"" she managed, her voice a dry rattle.

She closed the door and locked it again. Behind her lower front teeth, two more slivers of white had breached the surface.",1,1769285279.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1qlx8i0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qlx8i0,"20 hours and 1k miles in single digit temps, a 2025 Hybrid Maverick driving report","The vehicles: 

Helping my son move 7 states away, me  in a 2025 hybrid Maverick, my son and wife in a much older Rav4 drove the 1000+ miles straight through with numerous stops for rest, coffee, bathrooms, and drive swaps.

We'd originally planned to stop for the night about halfway but the 10"" of snow forecasted to start in the early morning hours of that 2nd driving day changed our plans.

1. **Fuel economy** slightly worse than usual for this 99% highway drive, which averaged out to 60 mph.
   * MPG went noticeably down with the temperatures, bottoming out around 29 mpg as temps dropped under 3º F
   * The hybrid delivered similar fuel economy in its worst conditions (cold, 99% highway driving, and mountains) than the ecoboost in some of it's best (highway driving)
2. **Basic Features** 
   * **headlights** on the Mav are great, showing a bright even light from fog line to fog line. It was noticeable how road signs 1/2 mile away would appear out of the darkness when the high beams kicked on along rural roads.  
   * The Mav has the best **HVAC** system of any car I've owned.  The cab comes to temperature in a few minutes
   * I got the **Co-Pilot360** (such a marketing-y name)  package specifically for blind spot monitoring, but damn is the lane keeping nice on a long drive.  It reduces driver fatigue.
3. **XLT luxury package**
   * The **upgraded seats,** particularly lumbar support really made for a comfortable ride. My aging back wasn't even stiff even after 17+ hours in the truck.  Frequent rest breaks help.
   * **Heated seats**.  Best splurge ever. 
   * The light on the sidewall of the bed was very helpful when loading and unloading in the dark.
4. **Cargo space**
   * Everything in the bed stayed safe and dry thanks to the hard roll-up tonneau from Ford Accessories (aka BAK Revolver X2).  I'd Jenga'd everything in there pretty well too. Wow does the vinyl on that tonneau cover  stiff in the cold.
   * 3 huge pieces of luggage with jackets piled on top fit nicely in the backseat and made
   * This [$8 adjustable LED work light from Harbor Freight](https://www.harborfreight.com/250-lumen-portable-folding-led-work-light-71076.html) has a magnetic base lights up the whole bed for loading and unload.  Tip from a trucker friend of mine who keeps a couple of these in his tool bag.
5. **Infotainment**
   * Texting hands free with the other drivers to arrange fuel and other stops (or just to say ""did you see that cool thing we just passed?"" is really helpful.  
   * Both drivers using Waze with profiles set to visible and setting a unique mood (which changes the icon shown on other drivers map), is really useful when driving in a convoy.  I also found Waze to have the most accurate speed limits, oddly more up to date than Google.
   * When we did get separated, asking Siri ""How far away is <wife or son's name>"" helped not only let me know if I needed to slow down a bit for them to catch up, but by how much.
   * A CarPlay enabled weather app is invaluable in navigating around weather.  I've tried a few and keep goin back to MyRadar.  It's simple and accurate.",2,1769284960.0,FordMaverickTruck,0,1.0,False

A student at the University of Stirling, currently studying an International Foundation in Film & Media, and planning to go into screenwriting in the future.

Here’s a bit about me:

My interests & hobbies: 

🎬 Movies & TV: Huge fan of Star Wars, Marvel, DC, and the Stephen King universe. I’d love a friend who enjoys watching or rewatching films together and actually talking about them.

🍳 Cooking: I really enjoy cooking with people. It’s more fun when it’s shared.

🎮 Games: RDR2, GTA, Spider-Man, Jurassic World Evolution

🚶 Walking & exploring

☕ Coffee lover

🐎 Horse riding

✈️ Travelling & discovering new places

I’m neurodivergent (dyslexic) and I’d say my emotional awareness is quite high, so I really value honesty, empathy, and meaningful conversations. I’m looking for friends who are emotionally mature and open to building a genuine connection. Someone who isn’t judgemental and if you’re a nerd, even better! 

I’d love to explore Scotland together, hang out, watch movies, or just chill and talk.

I am NSFW-friendly, but mainly looking for meaningful friendships.

I’m happy to call online first and FaceTime before meeting, just for mutual comfort and safety.

At the same time, I also purchased a ZP6, and I have owned a classic Comandante with Nitro Blade burrs for around three years, which has been my daily driver.

After extensive testing, I can confidently say that the Tigershark is my clear favorite. In my opinion, it successfully combines the best characteristics of the Nitro Blade and the ZP6 burr sets.

The clarity is outstanding, yet sweetness and body are still very present and never get lost. Compared to the classic Nitro Blade, the body is slightly reduced, but this comes with a significant gain in flavor definition.

I would describe the Tigershark as follows:

It delivers extremely high clarity, strongly emphasizing floral notes, while integrating acidity in a very harmonious and balanced way. The cup profile feels precise and elegant rather than heavy.

My testing was mainly done using coffees from DAK, Koppi, Tim Wendelboe, Tanat, April, and Quo.

Especially for lighter roast profiles, the Tigershark truly shines. It excels at highlighting nuance, complexity, and structure, making it an excellent choice for modern, light-roasted coffees.

Conclusion:

For my taste and brewing style, the Comandante Lab Series Tigershark stands out as the most compelling burr set I’ve used so far and has become my new reference grinder.",4,1769284109.0,pourover,1,0.75,False
1qlwuvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qlwuvj/supernumerary_part_one_of_a_slowburn/,Supernumerary (Part One of a Slow-Burn Psychological and Body Horror Story),"Sheila stood in front of her bathroom mirror, the fluorescent light flickering with a high-frequency hum that seemed to vibrate against her entire being. She hooked her index finger under her upper lip and pulled. There it was. A new tooth, perfectly formed, stacked neatly atop her central incisor.

What had initially felt like a strange bump in her upper gums had now revealed itself to be a fully formed tooth, comparable in size to the tooth it was directly above. She was thirty-five years old. Her dental development should have been a closed book for over a decade.

“We’re matching!” squeaked a tiny voice. Her five-year-old son, Finn, was tugging at his own lip. A similar protrusion was visible in his small, pink mouth.

“That’s your grown-up tooth,” Sheila said. “Means you’re getting big.”

Her son grinned, then frowned thoughtfully and pointed again. “Are you getting big, too?”

Sheila giggled and rubbed Finn’s curly hair.

Reluctantly, she booked a dentist appointment for Monday.

The week was a slow-motion car crash of condescension and rising pressure. At the office, her boss, a man named Miller who smelled of expensive coffee and stale ambition, leaned over her desk.

“Sheila, these reports are… incomplete. I’m unable to present these to the board. You seem distracted.”

She stared at his mouth while he spoke. She found herself counting his teeth. Thirty-two. A standard, boring set. She felt a surge of irrational, jagged hatred. She wanted to reach across the mahogany desk and rip the precision out of his jaw.

She felt the new tooth click against her upper lip. It was sharp.

At school, Finn stood near the chain-link fence, his back to the brick wall of the gymnasium, as he watched his classmates running around. The other boys didn’t let him play football anymore. His face, once soft and symmetrical, had become a topography of hard ridges and asymmetrical swells.

Suddenly, the football flew through the air and landed hard on Finn’s nose. It stung, but he tried to play it off with a nervous laugh. The boys just stared at him.

""My dad says your face is melting,"" Leo said. He leaned in, peering at the way Finn’s jaw pushed outward at an unnatural angle. ""He says you’re a freak.""

Finn felt a lump in his throat and fought to hold back his tears.

Before the drive home, the world felt too bright. Finn was zoned out, in his own world. Something Sheila usually found charming. Today, it felt like a personal affront.

“Get in the car, Finn. Now,” she barked.

“But I found a rock that looks like—”

“I don't care about the fucking rock!”

The silence in the tiny Chevrolet was thick and uncomfortable. At dinner, when he pushed a piece of broccoli away, she snapped. She stood up, her chair screeching against the linoleum. She shouted until her throat felt raw, until Finn shrank into his seat and sobbed uncontrollably.

Monday. Dr. Tresham’s office. The smell of clove oil and latex reminded her of a funeral home.

“How strange,” muttered Dr. Tresham as he adjusted the overhead light. The heat of the bulb radiated against Sheila’s forehead. “The eruption speed is—”

“Can you remove it?” Sheila’s words were clipped.

“We’ll need a map first. An X-ray to see the root structure. We don’t want to damage the original incisor.”

“So it’s serious?”

“I don’t think so, no,” Tresham offered a smile intended to be reassuring. It wasn't. “Just a rare adult supernumerary. Nothing we can’t handle.”

Sheila left the office with a prescription for ibuprofen and a sense of impending structural failure.

The weekend was a descent.

By Friday night, the pain had progressed from a dull ache to a rhythmic pounding, like a hammer striking an anvil inside her jawbone. She retreated to the bathroom, locked the door, and gripped the edge of the porcelain sink.

Knock. Knock.

The sound vibrated through her skull, amplified by the new bone. It felt like a chisel hitting a nerve.

""Mummy? Are you crying?""

It was Finn. His muffled voice was filtered through the wooden door.

""I’m fine, Finn."" Her words were thick.

""I have my doctor kit,"" he said. The handle rattled. He was trying to help. ""I can give you a check-up. I have the special light!""

Sheila squeezed the porcelain until her knuckles turned the colour of the bathroom tile. The ibuprofen sat unopened on the counter.

""Finn. Leave. Me. Alone.""

""Is your tooth hurting you?"" he persisted. His tone was innocent, ""I can fix it. I’ll be the dentist.""

Sheila yanked the door open. The sudden movement sent a spike of agony through her jaw that felt like a lightning strike. Finn jerked backwards, wide-eyed.

""Shut up!"" she roared. The sound was a wet, grinding snarl.

Finn’s plastic stethoscope clattered to the floor. He stared at her. Not at her eyes, but at her mouth. Her lip had snagged on the new incisor, drawing a thin, bright line of blood.

""You're... you're bleeding."" He whispered.

The anger evaporated, replaced by a cold, metabolic shame.

""Go to your room,"" she managed, her voice a dry rattle.

She closed the door and locked it again. Behind her lower front teeth, two more slivers of white had breached the surface.",1,1769284102.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1qlwmd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1qlwmd5/how_to_be_attractive_as_an_introvert_the/,How to Be ATTRACTIVE as an Introvert: The Science-Based Playbook Nobody Tells You,"look, i spent years thinking i needed to become an extrovert to be attractive. that if i just forced myself to be louder, more social, more ""out there"" then people would finally notice me. spoiler alert: that's complete bullshit.

after diving deep into research, reading dozens of books on psychology and charisma, listening to countless podcasts from actual experts (not instagram gurus), i realized something wild. introverts have a completely different playbook for attraction. and honestly? when played right, it's more powerful than the extrovert route.

the problem isn't your introversion. it's that society keeps shoving extrovert tactics down your throat and acting surprised when they don't work for you. but here's what actually works:

**depth over breadth in everything**

extroverts win through quantity. introverts win through quality. this applies to literally everything, conversations, relationships, even eye contact.

instead of trying to talk to everyone at a party, have one genuinely interesting conversation. ask questions nobody else asks. listen like you actually give a shit (because you should). people are so starved for real attention that when someone truly listens, it's magnetic.

**The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down perfectly.** she's a charisma coach who's worked with everyone from Fortune 500 execs to military leaders. the book destroys the myth that charisma is about being the loudest person in the room. turns out, presence (being fully there in a conversation) is way more attractive than performance. one exercise she teaches: focus completely on the sensation of your feet touching the ground while talking to someone. sounds weird but it anchors you in the moment and people can feel that energy. insanely good read that'll change how you view social interactions entirely.

**leverage your natural observational skills**

introverts notice shit that extroverts miss. you pick up on body language, tone shifts, what people aren't saying. this is a superpower for building genuine connections.

use it. mention something specific you noticed about someone. not in a creepy way, just authentic. ""you seemed really excited when talking about that project"" hits different than generic small talk.

**create intentional solo presence**

confidence comes from being comfortable alone in public. sounds counterintuitive but hear me out.

start small. go to a coffee shop alone. sit there without your phone for 20 minutes. just exist. then level up. go to a movie alone. eat at a restaurant alone. the confidence you build from not needing constant social validation is genuinely attractive.

there's solid research backing this up. Dr. Bella DePaulo at UC Santa Barbara studies single people and solitude. her work shows that people comfortable with solitude have better emotional regulation and stronger sense of self. and guess what people find attractive? someone who doesn't desperately need them for validation.

**master the pause**

when someone asks you something, don't rush to fill the silence. take a breath. think. then respond. the pause creates anticipation. it signals you're thoughtful, not reactive.

Matt Abrahams talks about this in his Stanford lectures on communication (check out his podcast Think Fast, Talk Smart, genuinely transformative stuff). he explains that pauses create psychological weight. people lean in. they actually listen harder.

**build a rich internal world then selectively share it**

read weird books. develop niche interests. have opinions on things. then when someone asks what you've been up to, you actually have something interesting to say.

i started using an app called StoryWorth which prompts you with weekly questions about your life, thoughts, experiences. it's technically for preserving family stories but using it made me way more articulate about my own experiences and perspectives. when you can tell a good story or explain why something matters to you, people remember you.

another thing that's helped is BeFreed, an AI learning app that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. you can literally type in ""become more attractive as an introvert"" and it builds a structured learning plan addressing your specific challenges. what stands out is the depth control, you can do a quick 10-minute overview or switch to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and context when something clicks. the voice options are honestly addictive, there's this smoky, confident tone that makes even dense psychology research feel engaging during commutes. it connects insights from multiple sources, so you're not just getting one perspective but seeing patterns across different experts and studies.

**Quiet by Susan Cain is basically the introvert bible.** if you haven't read it, stop everything and get it now. Cain spent seven years researching introversion and interviewed neuroscientists, psychologists, and introverts across different fields. she demonstrates that introversion isn't a flaw to fix but a different way of processing the world. the book includes practical strategies for leveraging introvert strengths in relationships and social situations. this is the best book on understanding and embracing introversion i've ever encountered. seriously life changing.

**physical presence matters more when you talk less**

since you're not filling space with constant chatter, your physical presence carries more weight. stand up straight. make deliberate eye contact (not creepy staring, just present). move with intention not nervousness.

hit the gym or do some form of physical activity. not for vanity (though that's a bonus) but because physical confidence translates to social confidence. when you feel strong in your body, you carry yourself differently.

**embrace strategic social energy management**

extroverts recharge around people. you recharge alone. stop apologizing for this.

be honest about your social battery. ""hey i had a great time but i need to recharge, catch you later"" is way more attractive than forcing yourself to stay and becoming a zombie version of yourself. people respect boundaries.

**use text and writing to your advantage**

introverts often communicate better in writing. use this. send thoughtful texts. write actual messages not just ""hey wyd."" your ability to articulate feelings and thoughts through writing is genuinely attractive.

**learn to project calm energy**

anxiety is contagious but so is calm. when you're genuinely comfortable with yourself, people feel safe around you. this is massively attractive.

try the Insight Timer app for meditation. i know, i know, meditation sounds like wellness culture bullshit. but there's legit neuroscience showing it helps regulate your nervous system. when you're less reactive and more grounded, people are drawn to that energy. the app has thousands of free guided meditations, many specifically for social anxiety and confidence.

**The Introvert Advantage by Marti Olsen Laney** digs into the actual brain chemistry differences between introverts and extroverts. she's a psychotherapist who explains why introverts need more time to process, why overstimulation drains us, and how our brains literally use different neural pathways than extroverts. understanding the biological basis helped me stop seeing my introversion as a personality flaw. plus she gives concrete strategies for managing energy in social situations.

look, you're not going to become the life of the party. and that's completely fine because that's not your lane. your lane is depth, presence, observation, and intentional connection. those qualities are incredibly attractive to the right people.

the whole ""fake it till you make it"" advice? trash for introverts. instead, lean so hard into your natural strengths that they become undeniable. be so comfortable with who you are that other people can't help but notice.

stop trying to be attractive like an extrovert. start being attractive like an introvert. completely different game, same win.",1,1769283572.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

# Beyond the Bloom: Does Hibiscus Love Coffee Grounds?

Imagine that first sip of coffee in the morning – the gentle steam rising, the rich aroma filling your kitchen, the promise of a perfectly balanced cup. It’s a ritual many of us cherish. And while we often focus on the beans themselves, the journey from farm to cup, and the magic of freshness, sometimes we wonder about the little things. Like, do plants like hibiscus enjoy a sprinkle of used coffee grounds?

While your hibiscus might appreciate the nutrient boost from composted coffee grounds (they can add nitrogen and acidity), the real magic happens when we turn our attention back to the coffee itself. The idea of using something ""extra"" is appealing, but when it comes to your daily brew, the best quality comes from intention and expertise. Generic beans, even those tossed into your garden, can't compare to coffee cultivated and roasted with meticulous care.

At Intelligentsia, we believe the ""best coffee beans"" are defined by more than just origin; they're about relationships and unparalleled freshness. Our commitment to **Direct Trade** means we build long-term partnerships with farmers, paying premium prices for exceptional quality and ensuring ethical practices from seed to harvest. This isn't just about buying beans; it’s about investing in communities and cultivating the finest coffees the world has to offer.

What truly sets Intelligentsia apart is our dedication to delivering coffee at its absolute peak:

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Our **Roast-to-Order** system means your coffee is roasted specifically for you and shipped immediately. It never sits on a shelf.
*   **Ethical & Exceptional Sourcing:** Through Direct Trade, we guarantee a higher standard of quality and a more equitable partnership with our growers.
*   **Flavor Clarity:** Experience the true, unadulterated taste of each coffee, whether it's our legendary **Black Cat Espresso** or a vibrant single origin.

Instead of experimenting with your garden soil, elevate your morning ritual. Discover the difference that true freshness and ethical sourcing make. Explore our curated collection of **Direct Trade Single Origins** or let us surprise you with an **Intelligentsia Subscription** – featuring Roaster’s Choice, Seasonal, or our beloved Espresso options, all with **Always Free Shipping**.

(Need advice),"Context: I’m a college student (M20), and most of the actions I mention below happened while I was under the influence. I recently started trying to date, which is new for me. I’ve never really been into dating before. I don’t think I’m unattractive now, but growing up I was severely unattractive, so dating and confidence are still things I’m learning.

I went on a coffee date with a girl, and it honestly went really well. It was chill, we talked a lot, and the vibe felt good. By the end of it, we agreed to plan another day to see each other. As that day got closer, I texted her a couple days in advance. I didn’t get a response, and eventually she sent a text saying it just wasn’t going to work out and that she didn’t have enough time. I don’t really believe that explanation, which made it hurt more.

I was pretty heartbroken. The next day, I smoked some weed and drank a little. While in that headspace, I ended up texting a girl from my past who I had only ever hooked up with. While I was on my way to her place, I randomly ran into another girl I had met at a party months ago — someone I never followed up with or texted afterward. For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to text her out of nowhere and see what was up.

Of course, she didn’t know who it was since I never gave her my number back. Looking back, my actions feel really dumb and impulsive. The next morning, I explained who I was, but now I’m embarrassed about the whole situation.

On a scale of 1–10, how dumb was this?

I’m feeling pretty lost right now. I want to keep dating, but I don’t know if dating is for me. I feel like I keep making the wrong choices, especially when emotions and substances are involved. There’s also a chance I might be neurodivergent, and I’m just now realizing that I don’t always fit in socially or make the best decisions in these situations.

For example: there are the musicians on the stage (people who are good at music!) and the audience. Same with beer: it is made by brewers in breweries and consumed by people who buy the beer. Some people sew clothes, and other people make clothes. And so on, for any skill you can think of.

It’s not completely distinct, i.e. presumably some in the audience at the concert also play/sing music. I both make *and* purchase clothing and beer.

I love playing fiddle at farmers markets because the boundary between performer and audience is thinner. There’s no stage per se, except sometimes I stand on a low concrete wall near the picnic tables so people can see where the music is coming from. Kids dance, adults talk to me between tunes. Sometimes they actually interrupt me while I’m playing, which is actually a little annoying, but also I’m so glad they find me that approachable!

I adore the community nature of a farmers market. The vegetables are happy, the farmers & vendors are real people I get to know. There’s a low-key festival vibe. Parents & young kids zipping around, older folks going a little slower, people running into friends & neighbors for impromptu chats. Some sit on benches to munch on muffins and drink coffee. My fiddle music is part of this larger patchwork while all this other stuff is happening, with people intersecting with me in different ways. 

Over how many eons have these markets been happening? Many!!! My soul sings, knowing that I am joining in this continuous line of humans gathering in a central spot to exchange goods and friendship.

I feel this craving for more of these spaces in myself, and sense it happening more broadly too. We want it, yes, but I’d say it’s more true that we NEED it.

Where do these spaces exist for you? Is it a farmers market, a community event, religious gathering, a group of friends? 

I notice I started this writing thinking about boundaries between professionals and consumers, and moved into community spaces. Hmm. I will be pondering that! 

I sense there is something to the scale of the locale / community when it comes to us sharing our skills.",1,1769282732.0,u_Kitchen_Brews,0,1.0,False
1qlw6vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mint99/comments/1qlw6vv/best_handheld_milk_frothers_2026/,Best handheld milk frothers 2026,"Hey guys,

If you are not familiar with us, we are from Requiremints (operating also the Mint99 platform) and we spend our time researching tech and appliances so you don't have to. We recently reviewed 20+ options for handheld milk frothers in different price ranges.

Handheld frothers are awesome for leveling up your morning coffee without buying a massive espresso machine (or large automatic milk frother). Here are 3 things to consider before buying:

* **Power source**: Decide if you want a rechargeable USB version (saves money on batteries) or a battery-operated one (easy to swap and go).
* **Motor strength**: Higher RPMs or multiple speeds usually mean faster, smoother foam and the ability to mix thicker things like protein powder.
* **Attachments**: Some come with stands or extra whisk heads for baking, which is handy if you want a multi-purpose tool.

Here is what we found:

* **\[Best Overall Rechargeable\] Maestri House LunaFro** \- This one is super convenient with USB-C charging that lasts months. The 8000 RPM motor foams milk in 15 seconds, and it comes with a handy storage stand.
* **\[Best For Versatility\] FoodVille MF02** \- Great if you need more than just coffee foam. It has two whisks and adjustable speeds, making it solid for whipping cream or mixing light batters too.
* **\[Best Double Whisk\] Zulay Double Whisk** \- It has a dual whisk design that helps get foam faster. The handle is ergonomic, and the heads detach easily for cleaning. Good for hot or cold drinks.
* **\[Best Budget Battery\] Zulay Kitchen Frother** \- A straightforward, battery-operated workhorse. It has a strong motor, is dishwasher safe, and doesn't take up much space. Perfect for simple, everyday use.
* **\[Best With Display\] YUSWKO Milk Frother** \- Stands out because it has a screen showing battery life so you aren't caught off guard. Includes three speeds and a flat bottom so it stands on its own.
* **\[Best For Travel\] Simpletaste 706-0001** \- Compact and battery-operated, making it a good pick for camping or travel. It's very simple but delivers consistent foam for both hot and cold milk.
* **\[Best Value Pick\] Bonsenkitchen Handheld** \- Lightweight and very affordable. It has a simple one-button start and is great for quick cappuccinos, though it feels a bit less premium than pricier models.
* **\[Best Quiet Operation\] Peach Street Handheld** \- Operates very quietly and foams quickly. The slim design fits most cups, and it comes with a metal stand to keep your counter organized.
* **\[Best Eco Choice\] Nahida Milk Frother** \- Made with food-safe materials and USB charging. It includes three whisk heads and three speeds, offering versatility for baking and frothing in an eco-friendly package.

Hopefully this helps narrow it down for you.

Here is my log from yesterday  to today:

Hard to make a lot of conclusions from this.    baseline:  56 yo Male on keto for 11 weeks.   A few interesting things:

  
1.  After fasting until 3pm and then hitting my body with 54 grams of protein from whey, within 3.5 hours I was back in pretty good ketosis (0.8)

2.  I didn't get the same rebound for my second protein pulse, ketones only 0.4 after 3.5 hours.

3.  And the next day (today) at 11:40am still fasted (except for cream from coffee which I also had yesterday) I'm only at 0.2

  
Lots and lots of variables and only  N = 1.  

  
But here are I think some valid conclusions:

1.  Taking a single heavy bolus of just protein didn't 'knock me out' of ketosis for very long, only a few hours.

2.  Over my eating window of 3pm until 11pm it seems that the cumulative affect of protein, and then protein + fat had a greater impact iteratively on slowing my body's return to higher ketone readings.

  
Satiation / hunger:  My plan was to just do whey protein all day.   Well by 11pm my lack of satiation + hunger had convinced me that my science experiment was done!  lol.  Time to eat and enjoy!  I noticed bad eating habits creeping back in:   

1.  adding more food to my plate before I was even done with what was on it.

2.  reduced ability to just stop eating.

3.  Looking for satisfaction from eating.

I think this confirms what I seem to understand from the vets on this board:  Reducing fat too much relative to protein might bring on more intense cravings and ultimately backfire.",3,1769282498.0,keto,3,1.0,False

**PREDICTION LOOP**

 

After a long pause, Will left the bathroom stall. Thanks to Alex, he had been able to confirm that no one would find him there till mid-afternoon. It was a reckless approach, but with each next use of the clairvoyant skills, Will’s caution grew less. Even if it came to the worst, he’d only lose an insignificant loop. Considering the benefits he could obtain, the risk was worth it.

Sending a mass text to his group, the boy then left the school, running all the way to the radio tower. Both Jess and Alex had been adamant that Will wouldn’t stand a chance in a direct fight. That made him even more curious. Alternatively, he could try and find the remaining two mirrors at the mall. He already knew the summoner, so hopefully, she wasn’t going to go all out on him. The paladin was a different story entirely. Besides, if Oza was as connected as the goofball claimed, they could always make an arrangement.

Reaching the building was the easy part. Even so, Will kept an eye open for participants. On one occasion, he glimpsed a message informing him of a former looped. The complete lack of skills made it clear that nothing could be gained through interacting with him.

After ten minutes of sprinting, the building stood before him. Looking at it brought several sets of memories. This was where the Alliance of Nine had attempted to ambush the archer. This was also the place where Will thought her to be hiding. It was undoubtedly the best shooting spot in the city, but offered little in terms of protection.

A constant flow of people went in and out of the main entrance. Will had gone in through there in the past. The fully mirrored elevator was still fresh in his mind. Today, he was going to take a different approach.

*Conceal. Hide.* The boy rushed to the side of the structure.

No one noticed him zigzag through the people gathered. Holding his breath Will leaped up, continuing to climb directly up the wall. Twenty feet up, he sunk a dagger into the solid surface.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Window shattered**

 

For the average observer, massive spider-cracks would spontaneously form on the radio tower’s windows. There was no logical explanation why the glass would shatter. People would instinctively jump away, then overload the help lines, trying to describe the illogical.

It was a safe bet to assume that all participants in the area had become aware of Will’s approach. Normally, that would be bad, but right now it was to his advantage. The more of them made an appearance, the better understanding he’d get for next time.

Four floors from the top, Will decided it was time to enter inside, which he did. Shattering through the window, he instantly became visible to all the office workers present.

 

**PARALYZED**

 

Messages appeared as he threw a dagger at anyone within sight. Once he left this loop, there would be a lot of stories to share. That would be an issue for the temps, though.

“Stop! Hold—” A security guard jumped out from a corridor.

As diligent as the man was in his job, a dagger hit him in the shoulder, causing him to freeze up before he could finish his sentence.

Walking calmly through the room, Will looked at the doors. With a few exceptions, each of them had a metal plaque indicating the name and position of their occupants. Reaching a title that seemed important, the boy kicked open the door and walked in.

A bald middle-aged man stared at him with the annoyance of a principal being interrupted. Apparently, the man wasn’t aware of what was going on in his own building.

“Where’s Oza?” Will asked.

“Who?” The man blinked, only to get a paralyzing dagger in the arm.

It was too much to hope that Oza would be the cleric’s actual name. Will was about to turn around and continue to the floor above when one of the walls exploded.

 

**EVASION**

 

Will managed to pull to the side just in time to avoid the massive spear that flew through the room. A split second later, a second followed.

This time, Will was able to draw a weapon from his mirror fragment and deflect the attack.

*Lancer*, he thought. Of all the participants he knew, that was the one he disliked the most. What was he doing there, though? There was no way this was his loop start.

“Shadow,” Will called his wolf, then leaped into the corridor.

The moment his foot came into contact with the carpet, a painful, shocking sensation ran through his body. In an instant, he had lost all control over his body. This wasn’t paralysis, though. It was different and a lot more painful.

 

**Ending predication loop.**

 

Two participants? Will thought as he immediately started the next prediction loop. Alex wasn’t kidding that the cleric was well protected. The lancer was the sort of scum that would take on any job for payment. He wasn’t the type to bother with traps, though. Whoever it was had acted fast, arriving on the scene moments after Will had entered the floor. Or were they already there?

This prediction loop, Will tried to enter the standard way. The results were even worse. Even before he could reach the elevator, the lancer had sprung into action, attacking him in the lobby.

“How are you here?” Will asked, pinned to a wall.

The fight had lasted close to a minute, but all that time he had been on the defensive. It was expected that he’d end up this way.

“Kids.” The lancer shook his head and then pierced Will through the chest. “You never learn.”

 

**Ending predication loop.**

 

Will jumped forward. The burning pain lasted for a few moments before quickly fading away. The boy instinctively looked at his chest, expecting there to be a wound. Fortunately, eternity had taken care of that.

*So that’s your game.* “Any advice?” he asked, holding up his mirror fragment.

 

**\[You have two unused Class Tokens\]**

 

The guide reminded without indicating what classes Will had to improve.

“Easy for you to say,” the boy released the mirror piece, letting it fall back onto his chest.

Two options came to mind: spend the entire morning fighting wolves, or rush to the radio tower in the hopes the lancer wouldn’t be there.

 

**PREDICTION LOOP**

 

“Merchant.” Will walked out of the bathroom stall, then went up to the mirrors in the room. “A thirty-minute loop extension.”

The price was more than he would have liked, but he paid it nonetheless. Now, he had close to forty minutes to do what was necessary.

Rushing through the corridor, Will went to the basement, where he faced his first wolf pack. Killing off the creatures was painfully easy. If anything, the greatest bottleneck was waiting for them to emerge from the mirror one by one.

As their corpses cluttered the room, Will went up to the mirror and tapped twice in rapid succession.

 

**WOLF PACK REWARD (random)**

**FEAR RESISTANCE (permanent): all effects of fear are greatly diminished.**

 

*A permanent?* Will thought. It felt like an eternity since he last got one. Although not combat-related, the skill wasn’t remotely bad. It would definitely help improve his precision and decision-making in battle.

The level up was spent improving the crafter class. After a few moments of consideration, Will then spent his class tokens on permanently improving the class so he could reach level four. In terms of immediate benefit, it could be argued there were better choices, but he had decided to play the long game. There would be many more opportunities until the reward phase and, unlike what Jess had told him, he continued to believe in symbiotic effects more than in maxing a single one.

A few more wolf mirrors remained in the school, but Will made the snap decision to get the remaining level outside. He had already boosted the archer and the clairvoyant before starting the prediction loop, which meant he effectively needed to kill off two packs to boost his thief and crafter one more time.

Already the boy knew that this would be another scouting loop, so he wasn’t overly concerned with being discreet. Relying entirely on the concealment skill, he slaughtered the next three packs, earning some mediocre temp rewards and two level ups. By the time he was finished, seven minutes had passed.

*Half an hour.* Will looked in the direction of the radio tower. From here on, it was all a matter of speed. Taking a deep breath, the boy mentally plotted his path, then set off sprinting. Leaping onto cars, without a second thought, he propelled himself through the air, heading to his goal. As before a few messages appeared above people in the crowd. The skills were too few to consider them participants, so Will kept on going.

In less than a minute, the doors to the radio tower lobby were before him. Will didn’t even slow down.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Door shattered**

 

The entrance burst into pieces as the boy ran inside.

 

**MOMENTARY PREDICTION**

 

Will looked around, searching for the lancer. His eye of insight revealed nothing, and no spears came flying through walls. That was a good sign.

People froze, the shock of the sudden event effectively freezing their minds. None of them were expecting anything of that nature. From their perspective, this was supposed to be just another boring day at the office. By the time realization struck, bringing with it an explosion of panic, Will had already shattered the elevator doors and dashed up the shaft.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Cabin shattered**

 

The boy punched through it, continuing upwards. The collective skills he had unlocked let him leap on the inside of the shaft better than if it were a flight of stairs. That was something to keep in mind in the future.

*Eight*. The boy counted the floors as he passed by the next set of elevator doors on the side. Last time he had checked, it was four floors from the top. This time he planned to go all the way up and continue down.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Door shattered**

 

The elevator doors flew off their frames, continuing through the corridor.

There were significantly fewer people here. Will spotted two young men in business suits—interns by the looks of it—carrying cardboard trays of coffee. There were no security guards, only a few doors with expensive-looking name plaques. One name instantly caught Will’s attention: Olesha Zarra.

“Oza,” he whispered to himself.

 

**MOMENTARY PREDICTION**

 

Will went to the door and tried to open it. To his surprise, nothing stopped him. There were no traps, surprise attacks, or unexplained phenomena.

“I’ll need your backup on this, buddy,” he whispered, then stepped inside.

The office was a lot wider than the one he had been in the previous loop. Everything about it emanated power, from the modern sculptures and wall paintings, to the massive bookcase with leather-bound tomes, to the new-style desk made entirely of black marble.

“Three minutes early,” a woman said from behind the desk with a list of skills so large that the individual names were illegible.

She wore a strict light-beige suit that contrasted with her dark brown skin and raven black hair. Her nails and make-up were toned to perfection, giving even someone unfamiliar with the topic, such as Will, the impression that they probably cost a lot more than his phone.

“Will you just stand there?” the woman asked. “You’ve got two minutes fifty before anyone shows up. And close the door.”

“You know me?”

“I know all the players.”

The woman turned the large display on her desk around. Several pictures of Will were displayed, arranged for effect. Photos of Will going to school, a copy of his school library card, images of him and his family. Most of them were easy to find, but compiling this twenty minutes from the loop’s start was intimidating.

Without hesitation, Will drew a knife from his mirror fragment and threw it straight at the woman. The best response to intimidation was showing he meant business.

 

**POISONED**

 

The blade pierced Oza’s expensive suit and sank into her chest. She didn’t make any attempt to avoid or deflect it, barely reacting at all.

 

**POISON NEGATED**

 

A glow surrounded the weapon, gently pushing it out of her until only the small circle of blood was left behind.

“I’d bill you for that.” The woman passed her fingers over the spot of blood on her vest. “If this wasn’t a prediction loop, that is.” She reached into one of the drawers and took out a gold-encrusted vape. “You’ve got two minutes and a half left.”

Yes, this is a repost. It’s less than a month to the 3rd anniversary of her accident. It’s rough.

Thank you for following along mine and Ashley’s journey. As I’ve often said, this is as much for me and my healing as it is to give to little A. Sorry for the length. M

June 2021

Since Ashley’s surprise visit in 2019, we have visited each other six more times. This would turn out to be the eighth, and final, visit.

While she was back in Washington, we would FaceTime every night without fail. If I close my eyes, I can picture this last FaceTime before her trip back here. Her hair was disheveled and she was laying on her stomach while we were talking. Some nights the camera is facing straight at her face, but not that night. She just had to position it where the curve of her butt was visible and those little boy shorts she loved to wear were on full display. She knew what she was doing and it worked - a cold shower was definitely needed. But I digress.

“Are you going to meet me at the airport tomorrow,” she asked while twirling her hair and biting her lip. I loved how she bit her lip - not all of the lower lip but just the corner. It was something she did when she had something on her mind.

For some reason that always drove me crazy. There was just something incredibly sexy about that and she knew I loved it. “I might make it,” in a silly attempt to tease her.

With a half grin, she shakes her head feigning annoyance. Just something about the way she did that. She sat up in full view and said, “remember this?”

“You kept it?” It was my old UGA shirt she had cut, making it a half shirt, and wore it all those years ago on Sundays when I’d make pancakes and she’d clean. It looked as good on her at it did back then.

The clock seemed to stop. Maybe even go in reverse. It was a Saturday and I was to pick her up at noon. This was going to be the trip I was going to ask her to marry me. I had made reservations for us to stay at this little B&B in Charleston. Holding the ring box I tried to think of a romantic place - Fort Sumter overlooking the water? The Angel Oak? The more I thought, the more my nerves were getting to me. “Maybe I’ll just wing it,” thinking to myself. That turned, incidentally, out to be the best idea.

Since I have joint custody of my kids from the previous marriage, I still had them when it was time to pack her up. In hindsight, it may have been wiser to drop them off a day earlier given the confrontation between their mom and Ashley, but I felt they should meet her. I had talked to Ashley about it and she was very excited to meet them. It wasn’t like they had never seen her since we FaceTimed nightly. Somehow they would find their way over to talk - however we always tried to talk after they went to bed.

As we waited at the airport, the kids were asking a million questions as all kids do. At least they were fascinated with something else, having never been to an airport before. Her plane was on time and it wasn’t long before she came down. She was wearing this little sun dress - instant flashback to the party. Absolutely beautiful.

Every time I met her at the airport, she’d literally run and jump on me, showering me with hugs and kisses. What can I say? She loved me. But not this time, it was all about the kids. Out of her carryon she pulled a small gift for each - something each liked based on their conversations. They took to her instantly, which warmed my heart beyond measure.

My turn was next. While she didn’t do her usual out of respect for the kids, she did hug and kiss me. She loved me.

They had a million questions for her and she was very patient with them. As we drove home, they did nothing but talk to her. It did not go unnoticed that she slipped her hand into mine as she’s done since our first date. They knew.

As I was making dinner, she got down on the floor with them and played games - things their mom rarely did with them. The motherly, nurturing side of her was coming out and it was a joy to watch.

I know what you are thinking, she stayed in a spare bedroom above the garage. As I was putting them to bed, they both told me how much they liked her.

The following day found all of us driving down to Jacksonville to visit the zoo. All in all, it was one of the best days we’ve had, according to the kids at least. The day ended all to quickly. It was obvious that it would have been a perfect fit.

Apparently my daughter had decided to send her mom a picture of her and Ashley. I knew something was up during the text exchange about dropping them off at our usual time. “Be nice” didn’t cut it. There was very bad blood between those two, and that day proved it. However, that confrontation will be another story.

“Your ex sure knows how to ruin a great day.” If words could be seen, they would have been red. Angry isn’t the word for it.

Quick thinking saved the ride. “Don’t unpack,” I told her. “I got us a B&B for a few days.”

She looked over at me and smiled. “Oh really? Do tell.”

“Nope” was all I could muster while trying to avoid the dagger eyes. I was milking it for all it was worth. While she loved surprises, the suspense was killing her. It was fun to see her squirm as she was like a kid waiting to open presents.

“Well, even if you won’t tell me you know how to put a smile on my face.” With that she leaned over and kissed me.

It had been a long, hot day at the zoo and we both were ready to get cleaned up. “I’m going to take a shower,” she said as she walked into the bathroom, leaving the door open. Now I may not be the smartest man, but I wasn’t about to turn down an invitation. Watching her undress was a thing of beauty.

“You’re staring again,” she said as she stood, biting her lip. Her form was exquisite - still a work of art. Stepping into the shower, she turns, “you coming?”

Invitation number two. I had forgotten that she liked her showers at near-sun temperatures as I jumped in a little too fast. “Damn, woman” I screeched as I tried to become one with the wall.

“I had forgotten how much of a wimp you are,” she said while turning down the temp to that of a flame thrower. “Now come here.”

Invitation number three. With that, she put her arms around my neck, “I’ve missed you.” It must have been a combination of missing me plus a little residual anger from the confrontation with the ex, but that was one interesting shower.

“Are you going to tell me where we are going,” she asked while laying on my chest later that night.

“Are you going to tell me that secret you keep mentioning?” See how that goes? Did it work? Not with her, proving that once again I know nothing about women.

“Soon. Very soon.” She was absentmindedly drawing circles on my cheek when she turned and looked me in the eye and half-whispered, “on our next trip, I promise.” If she could have snuggled in any closer, she would have. I went to sleep with her head on my shoulder and leg across me like I was a big pillow.

The next morning found her waking me up at 0500. If anyone got excited about trips, it was this one. She had the car loaded and coffee made. What can I say? I love that woman.

Convincing her to wait a while was a herculean effort. I was bombarded with more questions than my kids are able to come up with. Eventuality we went to this cozy little breakfast place on the water that we used to frequent those years ago. The perfect place for a quiet, romantic little breakfast.

There is something soothing about sitting outside on a deck listening to the water lapping against the pilings as we ate. She was very talkative and animated that morning, as she always was when she was excited. I don’t remember the conversation but I do remember thinking that I’ve never loved someone as much as her.

By the time we passed through Beaufort she knew exactly where we were going, as there are only two ways into Charleston from where we lived. She loved Charleston. “Is it that little place on the park by the water.” She asked.

“Yes. Yes it is.” We had seen it many times as we toured the area on earlier trips. Her eyes grew wide with excitement. She was happy and that was all that mattered.

We were staying in a quaint little carriage house tucked behind a 19th century house and facing the water. Beautiful isn’t the word for it. Amazing. The house was situated perfectly so one could sit on either story porch and enjoy the harbor breezes. The setting couldn’t have been any better.

After checking in and getting situated we explored the area by foot since it’s all centrally located. Battery park, rainbow row, old City Market - all of it. What a day that was. The spring in her step told me all I needed know. She was beyond happy.

She wanted to go to an upscale restaurant for dinner that night. She had packed this little black dress that fit her just perfectly. Combine that with heels and you have perfection. She looked like something you’d see in a magazine. I know, way out of my league.

She was drawing looks wherever we went that night, and rightly so. With her heels pushing her over six foot tall, she commanded attention. She certainly had mine.

After dinner we found this little dessert cafe/bar and rounded out the evening with a walk around the downtown area. The night was seasonably warm but not overly, with the breeze coming off the water. The stars were out and It was a cloudless night. Perfect.

We came across this ghost tour that had I openings. Fortunately, this one was a two person carriage tour. I know what you’re thinking, a ghost tour can’t be fun. Actually, our tour guide was great - but learning things not commonly taught is what makes it so good. Besides, what is better than a horse-drawn carriage ride just for two?

It was almost midnight before we got back. We were exhausted after a full day. Fortunately the shower was big enough for the both of us. This time I got to control the temperature. She loved having her head washed and as I stood there watching the water run down her back the only thought that came to my mind was that tomorrow was the day - the day that I was going to ask her to be my wife.

We went to bed the same way we always do - with her head on my shoulder and one leg across me, like I was a big pillow. She fell asleep almost instantly. Not me, I was staring at the ceiling and listening to the gentle breeze blowing through the live oak trees.

We slept in the following morning and after the complimentary breakfast, we headed out for the day - with the ring in my pocket in case the opportunity presented itself. She, being a history buff like me, wanted to visit historical sites. We visited the USS Yorktown because she’s never been on an aircraft carrier and also to see what I did with the Navy. While the Yorktown was much older than the ship I was on, it was still the same basic concept. We went from one end of the ship to the other. She had a million questions and loved it as much as I did.

We hopped on the ferry out to Ft Sumter. One would think that an old fort would be any sort of romantic place, but this one has its charms. We were standing on the parapet and overlooking the ocean when she moved in front of me and took my arms so she could wrap them around her waist. She leaned back against my chest while holding them at the same time. It’s like she was trying to make us one. “I wish we could stay like this forever,” she said.

Thinking this was the opportunity, I started to reach into my pocket when I chickened out.

“What are you doing?”

I had to think quick so all I could manage was “touching your butt.” Yeah, that didn’t work so well.

She turned and looked at me with that half-grin while shaking her head, “that’s not my butt, you dork.” One of the things I loved about her was her sense of humor. She took my arms and wrapped them even tighter. There was something about her, especially wrapped up like that, that just soothed my soul. If there is such a thing as a soulmate, she was it.

We had a busy day of playing tourist. Even though we’ve been to Charleston a few times, this one was special. This one was us as we were those years ago and should have been all along. I loved the way she would squeeze my hand just a little tighter when she saw things she liked.

It was after dark by the time we got back to the room. Grabbing a blanket I had packed, I asked to grab a bottle of wine and the package in the fridge, which were chocolate covered strawberries - her favorite, by the way.

“Your are just full of surprises, aren’t you,” she asked while wrapping her arms around her neck. If she only knew. It was now or never.

We walked over to the park and found a place near the water to put our blanket and lay our stuff out. There was just enough light from the streetlights in the park so that we could see, but not enough to spoil the stars and overall setting. The gentle breeze coming off the water was blowing through the massive old oaks. The sound of the rustling leaves was very soothing and helped set the stage perfectly.

Add the wine was chilling, we were laying on the blanket with her on my arm. The stars were beautiful and it wasn’t long before a shooting star appeared.

“Those are supposed to be good luck,” she said as one flew over. Here I was, under a beautiful sky with the girl of my dreams. How could it get any better?

Now or never. I had to move her head as I got up. “What are you doing,” she asked as she propped herself up on one elbow.

With my heart racing wildly, I got on one knee and pretended to get the strawberries. Pulling the ring out, I said “Ashley, will you marry me?”

There was just enough light to see her face. Still on one elbow, “wha” was all she managed to get out.

“I should have done this a long time ago. Ashley, will you do me the honor of being my wife?”

Her eyes started to well up. Of all the years I’ve known her, I’ve only seen her cry maybe a handful of times. By this time we were standing. She was crying full on - “you better not be joking with me.”

“I’m not, Ashley. You are my person and I want to grow old with you,” I said at I slipped the thing on her finger.

She looked at me then the ring and finally back at me. “Of course I will,” she said as she jumped on me wrapping her legs around me. We must have been sight for any passerby, with me completely holding her and crying with joy.

I don’t know how long we stood like that, but eventually we made it back to the blanket. After finishing the wine and strawberries we laid there a while just talking. She must have looked at the ring a hundred times if she did once. She was happy. I was ecstatic.

“Let’s get married in that little white church we saw in Gatlinburg,” she asked while looking at it once again and snuggling in even closer. This was as happy as I’ve ever seen her.

“Do you think your kids will accept me?”

“Are you kidding? They adore you. And they see how happy you make me.”

She smiled and looked into my eyes. “As soon at I get home, I’m going to book a flight back. This time you will get to see your surprise. Now let’s go to bed,” she said while taking my hand.”

It wasn’t until the sun was rising that we finally went to sleep. We left Charleston around lunch and the first thing she did when getting in the car was call her sister and family.

After arriving home, it was back in the car to see family and over to Steve and Misty’s. Time flew by and before we knew it we were at the airport saying our byes - and she was still looking at her ring. I had never seen her that happy.

The last time I talked to her was FaceTime on July 1, 2021. “I got our tickets. We will be there in two weeks.”

“We?”

“You’ll see,” she said with a grin.

**PREDICTION LOOP**

 

After a long pause, Will left the bathroom stall. Thanks to Alex, he had been able to confirm that no one would find him there till mid-afternoon. It was a reckless approach, but with each next use of the clairvoyant skills, Will’s caution grew less. Even if it came to the worst, he’d only lose an insignificant loop. Considering the benefits he could obtain, the risk was worth it.

Sending a mass text to his group, the boy then left the school, running all the way to the radio tower. Both Jess and Alex had been adamant that Will wouldn’t stand a chance in a direct fight. That made him even more curious. Alternatively, he could try and find the remaining two mirrors at the mall. He already knew the summoner, so hopefully, she wasn’t going to go all out on him. The paladin was a different story entirely. Besides, if Oza was as connected as the goofball claimed, they could always make an arrangement.

Reaching the building was the easy part. Even so, Will kept an eye open for participants. On one occasion, he glimpsed a message informing him of a former looped. The complete lack of skills made it clear that nothing could be gained through interacting with him.

After ten minutes of sprinting, the building stood before him. Looking at it brought several sets of memories. This was where the Alliance of Nine had attempted to ambush the archer. This was also the place where Will thought her to be hiding. It was undoubtedly the best shooting spot in the city, but offered little in terms of protection.

A constant flow of people went in and out of the main entrance. Will had gone in through there in the past. The fully mirrored elevator was still fresh in his mind. Today, he was going to take a different approach.

*Conceal. Hide.* The boy rushed to the side of the structure.

No one noticed him zigzag through the people gathered. Holding his breath Will leaped up, continuing to climb directly up the wall. Twenty feet up, he sunk a dagger into the solid surface.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Window shattered**

 

For the average observer, massive spider-cracks would spontaneously form on the radio tower’s windows. There was no logical explanation why the glass would shatter. People would instinctively jump away, then overload the help lines, trying to describe the illogical.

It was a safe bet to assume that all participants in the area had become aware of Will’s approach. Normally, that would be bad, but right now it was to his advantage. The more of them made an appearance, the better understanding he’d get for next time.

Four floors from the top, Will decided it was time to enter inside, which he did. Shattering through the window, he instantly became visible to all the office workers present.

 

**PARALYZED**

 

Messages appeared as he threw a dagger at anyone within sight. Once he left this loop, there would be a lot of stories to share. That would be an issue for the temps, though.

“Stop! Hold—” A security guard jumped out from a corridor.

As diligent as the man was in his job, a dagger hit him in the shoulder, causing him to freeze up before he could finish his sentence.

Walking calmly through the room, Will looked at the doors. With a few exceptions, each of them had a metal plaque indicating the name and position of their occupants. Reaching a title that seemed important, the boy kicked open the door and walked in.

A bald middle-aged man stared at him with the annoyance of a principal being interrupted. Apparently, the man wasn’t aware of what was going on in his own building.

“Where’s Oza?” Will asked.

“Who?” The man blinked, only to get a paralyzing dagger in the arm.

It was too much to hope that Oza would be the cleric’s actual name. Will was about to turn around and continue to the floor above when one of the walls exploded.

 

**EVASION**

 

Will managed to pull to the side just in time to avoid the massive spear that flew through the room. A split second later, a second followed.

This time, Will was able to draw a weapon from his mirror fragment and deflect the attack.

*Lancer*, he thought. Of all the participants he knew, that was the one he disliked the most. What was he doing there, though? There was no way this was his loop start.

“Shadow,” Will called his wolf, then leaped into the corridor.

The moment his foot came into contact with the carpet, a painful, shocking sensation ran through his body. In an instant, he had lost all control over his body. This wasn’t paralysis, though. It was different and a lot more painful.

 

**Ending predication loop.**

 

Two participants? Will thought as he immediately started the next prediction loop. Alex wasn’t kidding that the cleric was well protected. The lancer was the sort of scum that would take on any job for payment. He wasn’t the type to bother with traps, though. Whoever it was had acted fast, arriving on the scene moments after Will had entered the floor. Or were they already there?

This prediction loop, Will tried to enter the standard way. The results were even worse. Even before he could reach the elevator, the lancer had sprung into action, attacking him in the lobby.

“How are you here?” Will asked, pinned to a wall.

The fight had lasted close to a minute, but all that time he had been on the defensive. It was expected that he’d end up this way.

“Kids.” The lancer shook his head and then pierced Will through the chest. “You never learn.”

 

**Ending predication loop.**

 

Will jumped forward. The burning pain lasted for a few moments before quickly fading away. The boy instinctively looked at his chest, expecting there to be a wound. Fortunately, eternity had taken care of that.

*So that’s your game.* “Any advice?” he asked, holding up his mirror fragment.

 

**\[You have two unused Class Tokens\]**

 

The guide reminded without indicating what classes Will had to improve.

“Easy for you to say,” the boy released the mirror piece, letting it fall back onto his chest.

Two options came to mind: spend the entire morning fighting wolves, or rush to the radio tower in the hopes the lancer wouldn’t be there.

 

**PREDICTION LOOP**

 

“Merchant.” Will walked out of the bathroom stall, then went up to the mirrors in the room. “A thirty-minute loop extension.”

The price was more than he would have liked, but he paid it nonetheless. Now, he had close to forty minutes to do what was necessary.

Rushing through the corridor, Will went to the basement, where he faced his first wolf pack. Killing off the creatures was painfully easy. If anything, the greatest bottleneck was waiting for them to emerge from the mirror one by one.

As their corpses cluttered the room, Will went up to the mirror and tapped twice in rapid succession.

 

**WOLF PACK REWARD (random)**

**FEAR RESISTANCE (permanent): all effects of fear are greatly diminished.**

 

*A permanent?* Will thought. It felt like an eternity since he last got one. Although not combat-related, the skill wasn’t remotely bad. It would definitely help improve his precision and decision-making in battle.

The level up was spent improving the crafter class. After a few moments of consideration, Will then spent his class tokens on permanently improving the class so he could reach level four. In terms of immediate benefit, it could be argued there were better choices, but he had decided to play the long game. There would be many more opportunities until the reward phase and, unlike what Jess had told him, he continued to believe in symbiotic effects more than in maxing a single one.

A few more wolf mirrors remained in the school, but Will made the snap decision to get the remaining level outside. He had already boosted the archer and the clairvoyant before starting the prediction loop, which meant he effectively needed to kill off two packs to boost his thief and crafter one more time.

Already the boy knew that this would be another scouting loop, so he wasn’t overly concerned with being discreet. Relying entirely on the concealment skill, he slaughtered the next three packs, earning some mediocre temp rewards and two level ups. By the time he was finished, seven minutes had passed.

*Half an hour.* Will looked in the direction of the radio tower. From here on, it was all a matter of speed. Taking a deep breath, the boy mentally plotted his path, then set off sprinting. Leaping onto cars, without a second thought, he propelled himself through the air, heading to his goal. As before a few messages appeared above people in the crowd. The skills were too few to consider them participants, so Will kept on going.

In less than a minute, the doors to the radio tower lobby were before him. Will didn’t even slow down.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Door shattered**

 

The entrance burst into pieces as the boy ran inside.

 

**MOMENTARY PREDICTION**

 

Will looked around, searching for the lancer. His eye of insight revealed nothing, and no spears came flying through walls. That was a good sign.

People froze, the shock of the sudden event effectively freezing their minds. None of them were expecting anything of that nature. From their perspective, this was supposed to be just another boring day at the office. By the time realization struck, bringing with it an explosion of panic, Will had already shattered the elevator doors and dashed up the shaft.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Cabin shattered**

 

The boy punched through it, continuing upwards. The collective skills he had unlocked let him leap on the inside of the shaft better than if it were a flight of stairs. That was something to keep in mind in the future.

*Eight*. The boy counted the floors as he passed by the next set of elevator doors on the side. Last time he had checked, it was four floors from the top. This time he planned to go all the way up and continue down.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Door shattered**

 

The elevator doors flew off their frames, continuing through the corridor.

There were significantly fewer people here. Will spotted two young men in business suits—interns by the looks of it—carrying cardboard trays of coffee. There were no security guards, only a few doors with expensive-looking name plaques. One name instantly caught Will’s attention: Olesha Zarra.

“Oza,” he whispered to himself.

 

**MOMENTARY PREDICTION**

 

Will went to the door and tried to open it. To his surprise, nothing stopped him. There were no traps, surprise attacks, or unexplained phenomena.

“I’ll need your backup on this, buddy,” he whispered, then stepped inside.

The office was a lot wider than the one he had been in the previous loop. Everything about it emanated power, from the modern sculptures and wall paintings, to the massive bookcase with leather-bound tomes, to the new-style desk made entirely of black marble.

“Three minutes early,” a woman said from behind the desk with a list of skills so large that the individual names were illegible.

She wore a strict light-beige suit that contrasted with her dark brown skin and raven black hair. Her nails and make-up were toned to perfection, giving even someone unfamiliar with the topic, such as Will, the impression that they probably cost a lot more than his phone.

“Will you just stand there?” the woman asked. “You’ve got two minutes fifty before anyone shows up. And close the door.”

“You know me?”

“I know all the players.”

The woman turned the large display on her desk around. Several pictures of Will were displayed, arranged for effect. Photos of Will going to school, a copy of his school library card, images of him and his family. Most of them were easy to find, but compiling this twenty minutes from the loop’s start was intimidating.

Without hesitation, Will drew a knife from his mirror fragment and threw it straight at the woman. The best response to intimidation was showing he meant business.

 

**POISONED**

 

The blade pierced Oza’s expensive suit and sank into her chest. She didn’t make any attempt to avoid or deflect it, barely reacting at all.

 

**POISON NEGATED**

 

A glow surrounded the weapon, gently pushing it out of her until only the small circle of blood was left behind.

“I’d bill you for that.” The woman passed her fingers over the spot of blood on her vest. “If this wasn’t a prediction loop, that is.” She reached into one of the drawers and took out a gold-encrusted vape. “You’ve got two minutes and a half left.”

Hi everyone. i hope this post is okay in this sub. i’m currently seeking employment, and in regards to making coffee i only have fast food experience and no real drink making. i made ice macchiatos at home a few times and watched some videos but in terms of getting a job, i don’t know if this industry is easy or hard to get into as someone who’s new. 



With the current job market, what should i aim for in terms of seeking a barista roll? A chain restaurant or a indie shop? Does this industry in general take entry/being inexperienced employees or would i need to learn/gain experience? Is there classes i can take? i’d like to work in a indie shop but i’m intimidated by being inexperience, and not wanting to essentially hurt the store.



Even though i worked in fast food before, i’m shy, and tend to make mistakes when i’m new. i’m technically used to rushes but with something way more skill based yhan anything mainstream/basic like fast food/chain product, i just don’t want to experience messing up and being judged for it.

1qlw1fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1qlw1fy/help_me_unspiral_please/,"Help me unspiral, please","With the United States spiraling out of control and prices rising, I’ve taken a huge hit mentally because I feel so responsible for anything I do or don’t do. 

I finally deleted social media (except Reddit) because I can’t control myself. I have to watch others suffering so it won’t be in vain. I swear the algorithm knows when I’m struggling because it’s just the worst of the worst things going on. It got to the point where I was either going to delete it or end up suicidal.

I don’t know how to not feel helpless anymore. I know I partially do this to myself. 

I’m part time which means higher insurance prices so I dropped to a HDHP plan at work. I calculated how I could pay off my debt and still set aside money in an HSA. I’d have just enough for therapy. I’d work through being ready for a full autism assessment next year. I’d pay off my car in April. I could take care of most of my small bills and only need my husband to help with stuff for the baby. I have only extremely necessary subscriptions. I have “routines” that keep me getting up and getting to work more consistently than I’ve ever been. I understand that most of what I do is me being better for my daughter and one day she will be grown and I will need support as I fall apart again. I do everything I can to work on my shortcomings and be thoughtful of how others actions are reactions to what they are going through. 

My house is messy it’s been messy for a while. My husband is very rigid and I haven’t been the best at advocating for myself. I have short lived energy, a high energy baby, and I over extend myself at work. I’m praised for filling in for open shifts and treated like shit when I need off due to my baby being sick. It’s a very toxicly supportive environment. 

New Year’s Eve I got a warning letter for taking too many shifts off. The organization doesn’t recognize doctor’s notes which I have for every single time I was off (11 times in the past year). I applied and appealed for FMLA but was denied due to not having 1250 hours in over the past 12 months. 2 weeks later (on my birthday) I found out I was pregnant. This is very unexpected but clearly a result of my miscalculation. 

The full time position at work that I’ve been attempting to help cover shifts for was filled but the person is now seriously ill and cannot start. I’ve been trying so hard to help over the past 7 months with the hope that I’d be able to step back into my shorter hours and spend more time with my baby. I know this is such a privilege and the thought has been keeping my mental health buoyant. I do not buy new clothes, shoes, coffee, or makeup. I try to live as simply as I can and try my best to not take advantage of my husband’s ability to cover the big expenses so he can save and invest a better future for our baby. Overall, he cares for a big chunk of my needs and while I never let it excuse any toxic behavior between us, I can recognize that I could sometimes be a little more grateful for what he does AND be firmer about working towards investing in supportive changes for my mental health (cleaning and organizing the house at his expense). 

But now I’m pregnant with awful healthcare and barely recovered from horrible postpartum depression and I did this to myself. I don’t know what to do now. I simply can’t take on more shifts at a job that doesn’t comprehend how much hyper focus I dedicate to my role just to be a productive worker. I’m barely into my first trimester and I stopped my super low dose Adderall when I discovered it was giving me horrendous cramping. I’m waiting on the first available doctor’s appointment so I can even figure something else out. I don’t know if I can try going back on it later and hopefully not have cramping. I’m suddenly trying to find a bigger car (crosstrek or forester in place of my WRX so at least I’ll get something on a trade in) that I have no idea how to pay for. I applied for new jobs that I’m not even sure I can do but I’m desperate for a chance to escape the judgement culture at work before they find out and shut me out as a loser. I’m just making worse and worse decisions. I’m searching out breaking news on Reddit now and letting myself go down all the wrong rabbit holes and I’m destroying myself. 

Weekends are the worst. I’m exhausted but I want to start ALL the cleaning and organizing and baby prepping projects. So I barely get the groceries put away while my brain goes in every direction. I’m not slowing down and taking time with my little one like I want to. 

How do I get out of this spiral?

The hum of the engine and ship systems, the dim lights of the quarter's ""night mode"", and the subtle noises of the ship's secondary crew always seemed to keep him up at the worse possible time. Times like now, when he needed his rest for the upcoming mission.*

*His ship, the USS Bogatyr, had been tasked by Starfleet to investigate reports of Romulan sightings within the Neutral Zone, as well within Federation space. Thankfully there hasn't been any reports of attacks involved with these sightings as of yet, and most of Officers stationed in the nearby stations view the rumors as hoaxes spread by the colonists hoping to add a bit of excitement in their life. But Artyom felt in his gut that something was going on, and that it would soon reach a boiling point if it wasn't stopped soon.*

*""Bridge to Captain Vaskey.""*

*His much needed relief from pretending to sleep. ""Vaskey here, go ahead,"" he said as he started to change into his uniform, moving to his replicator to order something to help him stay awake.*

*""Sir, we've reached Starbase 243 and Admiral Kullau is requesting to see you. Are you available?""*

*Artyom couldn't help but smile slightly as he grabbed his coffee, adding a little extra kick to it as he finished readying himself. Of course Kullau is here. She had always been close by, even when he was at the academy. If he was a superstitious man, he might think that fate had bound them together. Luckily for him, he was more of a paranoid man, and felt that Kullau* *had wanted to find new ways to keep tabs on her little ""special project"".*

*He downed his drink. ""For Admiral Kallau? Always. Tell her I'm on my way.""*

Hello, and thank your taking the time to read over my prompt. I've been in a massive Star Trek mood lately, and I have been hoping to find a good partner to explore the universe with. I do have a bit of a plot in mind for how to start it off (feel free to ask questions as need be), but I would love to see where it ends up! While I do plan on writing as Captain Vaskey, your character can be whoever you wish.

I do have a few prompts for a plot as well. If any of them interest you let me know, and of course if you have any ideas of your own let me know as well. 

* Sightings of strange Romulan Warbirds have been reported in the Neutral Zone, with upgrades to their ships with technology the Federation does not recognize
* While on patrol the *USS Bogatyr* picks up a distress signal of a ghost ship, housing a dangerous creature inside
*  After the death of the Klingon High Chancellor, Captain Vaskey and his crew is sent to Qo'noS to help ensure a peaceful exchange of power, and to ensure that the new Chancellor is on good terms with the Federation

I want to invest in quality tools cos I’m considering the possibility of opening a home cafe someday.

Been seeing a lot of TT videos and IG reels using a gooseneck temp-controlled kettle and wondered if it matters in making matcha? Or is a regular temperature-controlled kettle just as good?

I wanna get the Haier 6 in 1 temp/controlled kettle but it’s not gooseneck.. I’m thinking it might be better given it’s multifunctional and has more mL capacity.

Gooseneck kettles are recommended for pour-over coffee because of the precise pour, but does that precision really make a difference for matcha preparation?

1qlw0d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qlw0d4/my_journey_to_espresso_and_the_realization_to_its/,My Journey to Espresso and the realization to its similarities to High End Audio,"This is my journey into espresso. It's a bit long, but hopefully you'll find it somewhat amusing. It's also my observation on how espresso as a hobby is something I'm finding strikingly similar to high-end audio.

2 years ago, my coffee consumption was to toss the cheapest Office grade bulk purchase pod into the Keurig and consume. And then there was the occasional trip to Starbucks for a gigantic caramel macchiato. At that point, at 58, one morning as I sipped on the caffeine bearing liquid, it struck me that maybe there was something maybe a bit better...

French Press. I'd heard that phrase. Maybe it was better. Amazon, found one, it had shiny Copper on it. Nice. Hit buy. A few days later I was a coffee affecianado. I bought some pre-ground coffee, heated the water and poured it in. Then waited 10 minutes because, you know longer must be better. I must be getting more...coffeeness.

And what came out was more intense... and drinkable... as long as I added two scoops of Lacanto drinking chocolate and a bunch of milk.

And there I sat blissfully for the next two years. Until I hired a new employee and we got to talking. I discovered he roasted his own beans. So he gave me a bag. Well, beans ain't gonna work in my French press so I need a grinder. Off to the local store where a Cuisinart ""Burr Mill"" lay on the shelf. ""Burr Mill"", that must be better. Cash handed over, machine transported home,  plugged in, set to the ""medium"" setting because that's probably fine...and next morning I was making coffee like a real barista. Filled the mug 3/4 with water tossed, and a couple of scoops... I don't know, two maybe three...that'll probably work... and still let it go for 7 to 10 minutes.    And yes, it was better, but still not great. Did that for two months and then decided I wonder if I could make this any better?

And that's when I made my mistake. I typed in ""making better coffee""... and then...gulp...""Espresso"" on YouTube....

I found some British dude named ""James"" who turned out to be somewhat amusing and had a video on ""why coffee makes you poop""... something you will learn to appreciate when you approach my age.

And then...there they were...shiny machines... reviews... advice... recipes...and grinders. ""The grinder makes all the difference."" And one claim where they could taste the difference between stainless steel and titanium burr grinder heads with one making coffee that tasted  ""brighter"".

Oh, I know that song!

You see, I come from 45 years of being in the world of high-end audio. A world and a hobby where microscopic differences are touted as being ""earth shattering"". A world where $10,000 power cords exist and plugged into the preamp ""made me feel like I was listening to Jesus being entertained by Mozart"". A world where shiny machines proliferate. And what was I staring at on YouTube? Yup. Shiny machines....with meters. Meters are good.

I NEED IT.

Now, granted, high-end audio, can get into an expense level that you not only buy a top of the line, espresso machine, but it would also include the full café, the building, a roasting setup with a ""roast master"", the employees/Baristas, signage, advertising campaigns, and a bookkeeper to go with it. But I digress.

One and a half months worth of review reading, plenty of paralysis by analysis, and I finally just said, screw it and hit buy on a Legato V2. Which just arrived this morning.

Now mind you, I had by this point read up on French press recipes. I started weighing things. I followed the four minute time, I stirred, I settled the fines, left the crust and I followed ""the procedure"". And damn if it didn't make an enormous difference. My coffee is tasting damn good.

But there was that statement ""the grinder makes the most difference"".

You know, I've heard this story before. That the $5000 audio interconnects were much better than the $200 audio interconnects. ""Trust us"" they whispered. Sigh. Fine.

Reviews read, Baratza ESP grinder ordered. Baratza ESP grinder cancelled after it never shipped, more reviews read,    r/espresso   , perused, Bean Glass grinder obtained. It arrived yesterday. So this morning, I tried it, skeptical, as I stared at my perfectly serviceable Cuisinart. How much difference could $350 worth of grinder make?

Dammit.

So here I am, about to clear off a buffet cabinet and move my convenient centrally located printer into my office in order to turn it into a dedicated coffee station with a brand new shiny machine.  It overlooks the acoustically treated living room with $50,000 worth of audio equipment sitting in there. I scaled back.

I suspect that the Home coffee roaster guys are probably the equivalent of the single end tube amp guys in audio. And even I'm not that insane.

And here I am, about to embark on an entirely new hobby... one with lots of shiny machines. I wonder how much those mineral additive bottles really make...

God help me.

Oh and yes, obligatory coffee station pic and post forthcoming with everything elegantly arranged...which will last about a week before the usual chaos takes over. I just need to find some motivation to carry that printer to the office.",14,1769282199.0,espresso,6,0.94,False

I, 28 F have lived with my partner, 34 M for two years now. We’ve been together around 3 1/2 years and this has been an issue since the early days of us dating, though not constant. I have trouble sleeping and during the week often get behind on sleep. Some of it is not having a great bedtime routine, which I’m working on. I really really don’t like being woken up. I never have.  If I need to be awake for something then of course I set an alarm and make sure I’m ready, but on weekends when I have nothing to be up for I like to sleep in. I have told him this I don’t even know how many times. And he still does it. He will wake me up to see what coffee I want, or to say I’m “so beautiful” and “do I know how beautiful I am?” Today he woke me up to ask if I wanted him to make me breakfast. He also fell asleep on the couch and when he came in to bed he said I was so beautiful, da da da da da, and woke me up then although I was thankfully able to go back to sleep then. I’m not usually able to. I think he is a good person and smart, I’m not sure if he forgets or if he just doesn’t take me seriously but it upsets me. I told him before; I would rather you just make breakfast for yourself, or get coffee for yourself or whatever than be woken up. I’m so tired of having this same argument over and over again. It feels so disrespectful, I’m not sure if this considered a boundary or what but he just keeps doing it and then  he gets SO ANGRY when I remind him I don’t like to be woken up for these things. I genuinely don’t understand. I’m not asking him not to go about his morning, I don’t mind if he goes and makes normal noises like making himself food or playing guitar or whatever. I just simply don’t want to be spoken to and woken up! Today after he woke me up and I was upset (we had this conversation literally last weekend)  he stomped around and was banging into things, idk there were a few loud noises (which also don’t make me feel safe and I’ve told him that) and now I think he left to go somewhere? Not really sure. He has BPD, not sure if that’s a factor in anything but he is medicated. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to keep doing this forever. Am I really asking too much to not be woken up on a Saturday or whatever? How can I better get him to see my point? Is there anything I can do differently? I try to honor the boundaries he’s put up, and I understand it’s hard to adjust and if he was apologetic or forgetful, I would try and be cool it’s just he gets so mad. He’s a great partner other than that, we just had to move due to insufficient heat and we’ve been handling all that pretty well I’d say. We have a lot of fun together, and our goals align for the future. We have been able to talk through most of our disagreements, acknowledge our emotions and move forward more intentionally. It’s just something about this that it keeps happening. I don’t want to break up and don’t think it’s come to that yet (I know yall love that on here lol) but I would love any advice on how I can handle this better, and also am I TA? I don’t think so but I just truly don’t understand.

I was always home body. I used to lived with my mom, my own room.  With my full time job great pay and benefits. Hangout with my friends. Always helping my mom with anything she needed. 

I had a girlfriend who lived lil bit far away, but we would see each other every weekend, sometimes she would came over or i would go over to her. We always traveled, eat in good restaurants and spend holidays together. I was very happy with my life. Actually the BEST time of my life.

Beginning of 2016 , i was going to a hard time dealing with anxiety. It was affecting my relationship with my then girlfriend. We would argue a lot. One day i went to a coffee shop, and the cashier was flirting with me. She was beautiful, i went back and she ended giving me her number. I was hesitated to texted because i still was in a relationship. But i did it, I texted and to make the story short. I left my girlfriend for this new girl. And that’s when everything started.

Within 3 months of dating the new girl, she wanted to move in with me. She would tell me every day, she wanted to always be next to me. I was so in love with her. I ended convincing my mom to let her move in with us. 

Within four months living together, she wanted us to have our own place. she again insisted so much. We ended up moving out of my mom house to our own place. 

The first few years, everything was great. Then third year things started to go down hill. She lost her job a few times. And living in a big city rent is super expensive. Everything was on me. She would stay home all day, every day. She would get jobs and leaving them. Years passed and somehow we made it to almost 10 years.

Beginning of last year, i notice she was acting different . I took her phone and saw her messages and saw a conversation she was having with a dude. She was cheating on me with a dude for almost a year. I automatically kicked her out. 

Karma got me. I was broke. Now a year later. Im here living alone. And i hate it. No friends (has everyone has their own families now) I had messed around with few women but i don’t feel interested in being in a relationship right now.   She also has called and texted me a few times. But I don’t answer. Im serious thinking to go back to my mom. But i have 1 dog  and my mom has very bad allergies to dogs.

1qlvqzg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qlvqzg,Flight Review: Fiji Airways Business Class (A350-900) SFO-NAN,"**FJ 871 | SFO → NAN | Jan 23–25**

Aircraft: A350-900

Seat: 16A

Cabin: Business

Booking: 108,500 Qantas points + $64.99

Points source: Amex Membership Rewards → Qantas (transferred Feb 2025)

⸻

**TL;DR**

Fiji Airways business class is a perfectly serviceable way to avoid physical misery on a long haul to Australia. The hard product is solid and the food is better than expected, but service execution, sleep protection, and soft-product coherence lag peers. On points, it’s fine. It’s just not aspirational.

Scope note: this review covers the long-haul SFO–NAN sector only. I also flew NAN–SYD on the same A350 business-class product, but that shorter regional segment is far less service- and sleep-intensive and did not materially change the conclusions below.

⸻

**Why I Booked This Flight**

I wanted certainty, specifically the certainty that I would not arrive in Australia physically wrecked after 15–20 hours in economy depending on routing. This was about avoiding pain and exhaustion, not chasing aspirational service.

For perspective, two years ago roughly 117k Amex points transferred to KrisFlyer got me Saigon–San Francisco in business class, with comparable travel time and a similar points cost. That experience delivered vastly better service, coherence, and sleep quality. This Fiji flight never came close to that level, despite operating in the same general redemption band.

⸻

**Ground Experience (SFO)**

Seat selection couldn’t be handled through Qantas and had to be done directly with Fiji Airways, which was straightforward enough.

Business-class check-in is shared with premium economy, and despite ample staffing for economy, it took about 10 minutes to be assisted. Not catastrophic, but not the calm, priority-signaled start you expect in this cabin.

TSA PreCheck worked fine, and Fiji has only recently integrated it.

Lounge access was via the refurbished Air France Lounge at SFO. Food and drink selection is solid, but the space is under pressure in the evenings with multiple Asia-bound departures. Some seating and bathrooms are already showing wear. Functional, not restorative.

⸻

**Boarding**

Gate announcements were unclear. Business-class passengers largely self-organized into a line based on intuition rather than instruction.

Onboard, the crew was warm and welcoming, but the service rhythm immediately felt loose. Pre-departure beverages were offered, but I was forgotten and had to remind a flight attendant of my order. A small thing, but an early signal.

⸻

**Seat & Cabin**

This is a Safran reverse-herringbone seat, effectively the same shell as the British Airways Club Suite minus the door, upholstered in leather rather than fabric.

At 6’2” and \~210 lbs, I found the seat a bit tight through the shoulders, especially when settling in for sleep. It’s not overtly restrictive, but there’s less lateral forgiveness than wider business-class seats.

The seat works best for back sleepers. The footwell is usable, but taller passengers should expect to actively push their feet into it, rather than having a naturally open sleeping channel.

Side sleeping is feasible, but the provided pillow doesn’t offer enough neck support on its own. I ended up using an extra blanket solely as a pillow supplement for proper alignment, which meant it couldn’t be used for warmth.

Upsides remain:

	•	Well-proportioned storage

	•	Individual air vents, a major comfort win if you sleep hot

	•	Clean white and gray cabin offset by island-themed bedding

No issues with overhead bin access or aisle clearance.

From a hardware standpoint, this is a predictable, competent long-haul business-class seat, but one that clearly favors certain body types and sleeping styles.

⸻

**In-Flight Experience**

	•	Departure: On time and uneventful

	•	Ride quality: Quiet, smooth A350

	•	Cabin temperature: Kept cool, which helped on an overnight flight

**Wi-Fi**

Complimentary for business class and nearly unusable, functioning roughly 30% of the flight. On a sector this long, that’s a material miss rather than a nit.

⸻

**Service Rhythm & Crew**

This is where the experience materially slipped.

Fiji advertises [*dine-on-demand*](https://www.fijiairways.com/en-fj/world-class-experience/business-class-dining), and the menu is clearly designed for it. That concept was never explained by the crew. Instead, I was told I’d be served dinner and breakfast at fixed times.

The flight attendant repeatedly nudged me toward the preset “supper set,” which felt optimized for ease of service rather than passenger choice. I ordered à la carte instead.

Meal pacing was uneven:

	•	Dinner service began \~30 minutes after takeoff

	•	Completed \~90 minutes after takeoff

	•	Several nearby passengers were skipped and had to follow up

Breakfast was scheduled three hours before landing due to turbulence, significantly cutting into sleep on a true overnight flight.

Everyone was friendly and spoke clearly. There was just *no cohesive choreography*.

⸻

**Food & Beverage**

The catering itself was better than expected.

Dinner included a shrimp spring roll, sliders, and a chocolate cake with ice cream. Not luxury dining, but well executed and genuinely edible. A small but telling touch: dinner was served with a faux LED candle on the tray table, very Turkish Airlines-adjacent in intent. It added warmth to the presentation, even if the broader service never quite matched the ambition.

Breakfast was the usual airline compromise: coffee, fruit, and poached eggs with smoked salmon on toast. The toast was soggy from pre-loading, but the eggs were actually runny, which already puts it ahead of many competitors.

Catering quality overall:

	•	Below Singapore Airlines

	•	Roughly competitive with Air France ex-SFO

	•	*Better than expected* given Fiji’s positioning

⸻

**IFE & Soft Product**

The screen was large and responsive, with an excellent moving map and nose/tail cameras (the tail camera failed late in the flight). Content selection was adequate but not distinctive.

Headphones were noise-canceling but unremarkable.

The amenity kit was fully deconstructed: cheap earplugs, disposable dental kit, socks, creams, and an eye mask that was uncomfortably tight. No pouch, which felt less like thoughtful minimalism and more like sustainability theater.

That theme continued late in the flight, when Fiji played a sustainability video over the PA and on the IFE screens about 90 minutes before landing. On an overnight flight where sleep is already fragile, this felt unnecessary and intrusive.

Bedding itself was decent but not standout: a good mattress pad (seat paneling still perceptible), an okay but undersized duvet for taller passengers, and a pillow that required supplementation. Comfortable enough, but clearly behind Singapore, EVA, or BA.

Lavatories were standard A350. Acceptably clean, though not especially well maintained as the flight progressed.

⸻

**Sleep & Comfort**

This should have been a reasonable sleeper. It wasn’t.

While the seat favors back sleeping, the combination of a tight shoulder area, a narrow-feeling footwell for taller passengers, and inadequate pillow support made sustained rest difficult without constant adjustment.

That was compounded by:

	•	Persistent galley light bleed

	•	Mood lighting never fully shut off

	•	Ongoing cabin movement

	•	Early breakfast service

	•	The sustainability video played \~90 minutes before landing

For me, *sleep landed at 5/10*.

⸻

**Arrival & Transfer (Nadi)**

Arrival was smooth, with business class deplaning first.

The jet bridge led to an outdoor apron walkway with excellent aircraft views, which was genuinely pleasant.

Transit itself was easy, but signage to the business-class lounge is poor. The lounge is subterranean and dim, with disengaged service despite decent food.

Showers: there is a single shower room accessed through the men’s bathroom, with no private toilet. Amenities are sparse, use is limited to 10–15 minutes with staff knocking, and water temperature was unlabeled and erratic, swinging from cold to scalding. Still, on a three-hour layover, I was glad to have a shower.

One bright spot: the barista-made coffee is excellent. An almond cappuccino hit the spot, and breakfast options (eggs, creamy spinach and mushrooms, lamb sausage, fruit and vegetables) were satisfying.

For completeness: the onward NAN–SYD sector felt consistent from a hardware standpoint, but the shorter duration made service and sleep issues less consequential.

⸻

**Overall Impression & Value**

7/10.

This flight delivered certainty over delight. I could lie flat, eat reasonably well, and arrive functional. It did not deliver polish, cohesion, or strong sleep protection.

Checking prices as of January 2026 for travel about one month out:

	•	Fiji business class: \~$3,700–$4,300, implying \~3–4 cpp on 108.5k points

	•	Singapore Airlines business (SGN–SFO via SIN): \~$4,300–$6,000, often \~4–5+ cpp on \~117k points, with far better service and rest

	•	Emirates First: \~180k Skywards miles + \~$1,000 in fees for a \~$15k ticket, implying \~7–8 cpp and a genuinely next-level experience

Fiji sits squarely in the middle: a rational, mid-efficiency redemption that prioritizes physical comfort over aspiration.

**Who this is for:** you want modern hardware and minimal risk.

**Who should skip:** you care deeply about cohesive service, protected sleep, or maximizing points leverage.",8,1769281618.0,pointstravel,1,0.83,False

First time posting here but I guess I'll lead with some info about me. I'm 36 and I live in Belgium (in the Dutch speaking half). I'm not much of a girly girl as I was raised with an older brother who was into motocross. I prefer to climb trees in jeans and a t-shirt over getting my nails done in a pretty dress. I live with my boyfriend and, once we finish our house, we'll be getting a puppy because I'm severely lacking pets in my life.

I'm looking for a pretty chill friend as I've had my fair share of drama llamas in my life and frankly, I don't understand drama. I'm sure the drama part of my brain is fried or something. I was diagnosed with ADD a looooong time ago and I guess that's part of the reason why I sometimes don't understand why some people like to make things difficult.

I've got a stressful job and during the weekends and my spare time I'm usually working on our house as we're doing everything ourselves. When I do find the time to relax I like to watch movies/series while crocheting or cross-stitching. I also love reading because books are the junkfood to my soul. And speaking of food, I absolutely love to cook. Of course I have many more interests but we'll talk about those during our chats I'm sure.

I'm looking for a friend that's pretty close to my age and preferably location. It'd be great if down the line we could grab a beer or coffee IRL. But hey, don't hesitate to message me even if you're not within the beer/coffee-grabbing range, or even if you prefer other beverages!

1qlvohh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1qlvohh/how_to_build_a_morning_routine_that_actually/,How to Build a Morning Routine That ACTUALLY Works (Science-Based Framework),"Look, everyone's talking about morning routines like they're some magic pill. Wake up at 5am, cold shower, meditate, journal, green smoothie, blah blah. But here's what nobody tells you: most morning routines fail because they're designed for Instagram, not real life. I've spent way too much time researching this, diving into neuroscience research, behavioral psychology books, podcasts with actual experts, not just self-help gurus. And yeah, I've also royally screwed up my own mornings enough times to know what doesn't work.

The real issue? We're treating symptoms, not causes. Your shitty mornings aren't just about willpower. It's your circadian rhythm fighting you, cortisol spikes at the wrong time, decision fatigue before you even brush your teeth, and habits that contradict how your brain actually works. But once you understand the science and build a routine that works WITH your biology instead of against it, everything changes. Let me break down what actually matters.

# Step 1: Stop Fighting Your Biology (Understand Your Chronotype)

First thing: not everyone is meant to wake up at 5am. Seriously. There's this whole field of chronobiology that shows people have different chronotypes, basically your genetic predisposition for when you're most alert. Dr. Michael Breus breaks this down in ""[The Power of When](https://www.amazon.com/Power-When-Learn-Best-Everything/dp/1785040456/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0)"", he's a clinical psychologist and sleep specialist who worked with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

Some people are lions (early risers), some are wolves (night owls), some are bears (follow the sun). Forcing a wolf to wake up at 5am is like forcing a lion to do their best work at midnight. It's fighting evolution.

Figure out your chronotype first. Take the quiz in Breus's book or just track your energy for a week without an alarm (if possible). When do you naturally wake up? When do you feel most focused? Build your routine around THAT, not some entrepreneur bro's schedule.

# Step 2: Win the Night Before

Here's the dirty secret: your morning routine actually starts the night before. If you're doom-scrolling until 2am, sleeping 4 hours, and expecting to wake up like a champion, you're delusional.

Sleep is non-negotiable. Matthew Walker, neuroscience professor at Berkeley and author of ""[Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144324/),"" has spent decades proving that sleep deprivation destroys everything, your mood, decision-making, immune system, even your looks. This book will legit make you paranoid about sleep (in a good way). Walker shows that even one night of bad sleep can impair you as much as being drunk. Yeah, that bad.

Set a reverse alarm, a time that reminds you to start winding down. 90 minutes before bed: dim the lights, put your phone in another room, drop the temperature to 65-68°F. Your body needs to cool down to sleep. Hot showers work because when you get out, your body temperature drops, triggering sleepiness.

No screens 60 minutes before bed. Blue light annihilates melatonin production. If you absolutely must use your phone, install f.lux or use night mode. Better yet, read an actual book.

# Step 3: Delay Your Coffee (Yeah, Seriously)

This one pisses people off, but hear me out. When you wake up, your body naturally releases cortisol, the ""wake-up hormone."" Drinking coffee immediately actually blocks cortisol production and creates a dependency cycle. You're literally training your body to need caffeine to wake up.

Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman (Stanford professor, runs the Huberman Lab podcast) recommends waiting 90-120 minutes after waking before your first coffee. Let your natural cortisol do its job. Then caffeine actually works better and lasts longer.

In the meantime? Get sunlight in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking. This is non-negotiable if you want to regulate your circadian rhythm. Sunlight exposure early triggers cortisol at the right time and sets up melatonin production 12-14 hours later for better sleep. Go outside for 10 minutes. Can't do that? Sit by a bright window. Huberman Lab podcast episode on sleep and light exposure breaks this down perfectly.

# Step 4: Move Your Body (But Not How You Think)

You don't need a 2-hour gym session. You need to wake up your nervous system.

James Clear talks about this in ""[Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299)"", the guy who turned habit formation into an actual framework that doesn't suck. He's a behavior change expert whose book sold millions because it actually works. His big insight: habits need to be stupidly easy to start. Don't aim for a full workout. Aim for putting on workout clothes. Or doing 10 pushups. Or a 5-minute walk.

Movement increases body temperature, gets blood flowing, releases endorphins, and signals to your brain that it's time to be awake. Could be yoga, stretching, jumping jacks, dancing like an idiot. Doesn't matter. Just move.

Try the ""5-5-5"" method: 5 minutes of stretching, 5 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, running in place), 5 minutes of breathing exercises. Total time: 15 minutes. Doable even when you're exhausted.

# Step 5: Hydrate Before You Caffeinate

Your body just went 7-8 hours without water. You're literally dehydrated. Drinking water first thing rehydrates cells, kickstarts metabolism, and helps flush out toxins that accumulated overnight.

Add a pinch of sea salt or use something like LMNT (electrolyte drink without sugar). Electrolytes help with hydration at a cellular level. Huberman swears by this, salt first thing helps your brain function better because neurons need sodium to fire properly.

Aim for 16-32oz of water within the first hour of waking. Bonus: it'll make you need to pee, which forces you out of bed if you're the type to hit snooze 47 times.

# Step 6: Do ONE Hard Thing (Before Your Brain Wakes Up)

This is the Eat the Frog principle applied to mornings. Before your brain has time to make excuses, knock out the one task you've been avoiding. Could be writing, studying, working on a side project, whatever moves the needle in your life.

Tim Ferriss calls this ""winning the morning."" He's interviewed hundreds of high performers on his podcast and found this pattern: successful people do their most important work early, before distractions pile up. Not because they're superhuman, but because they've engineered their environment to make it easier.

Set up your space the night before. If you're writing, have your laptop open to a blank document. If you're working out, have your gym clothes laid out. Remove friction. Make it so easy that your half-asleep brain can't talk you out of it.

Use the app Freedom or Cold Turkey to block distracting websites during this time. You're not strong enough to resist Instagram on willpower alone. Nobody is. Block that shit.

# Step 7: Feed Your Brain (Literally)

Breakfast is controversial. Some people swear by intermittent fasting, others need food immediately. Both can work, but if you're eating breakfast, make it count.

Protein and healthy fats. This stabilizes blood sugar and keeps you full longer. Eggs, Greek yogurt, nuts, avocado. Skip the sugary cereal and pastries, that's just a blood sugar rollercoaster that'll crash you by 10am.

If you're fasting, fine. But at minimum, get that water and electrolytes in.

# Step 8: Mind Maintenance (Not Meditation, Unless That Works for You)

Everyone says meditate. And sure, meditation is great. But if sitting still makes you want to claw your eyes out, there are other options.

Journaling: Julia Cameron's ""[The Artist's Way](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-Spiritual-Higher-Creativity/dp/1585421472/)"" introduced morning pages, three pages of stream-of-consciousness writing first thing. It's like taking your brain to therapy. Dump all the anxious thoughts, random ideas, fears, whatever. Gets it out of your head so you can focus. The book is a cult classic among creators and for good reason, it actually unlocks creativity and clears mental clutter.

Gratitude practice: Sounds cheesy but backed by research. Robert Emmons, psychology professor at UC Davis, has studied gratitude for decades. His work shows it literally rewires your brain for positivity and resilience. Write down three things you're grateful for. Takes 2 minutes. Changes your mental state.

Try the Finch app if you want something interactive. It's a self-care app that uses a cute bird to encourage daily check-ins, mood tracking, and habit building. Sounds childish but it actually works by making mental health practices feel less heavy.

For those wanting to go deeper without the overwhelm of reading every single book mentioned here, there's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). It's an AI-powered learning app that pulls from psychology research, behavioral science books, and expert insights to create personalized audio content tailored to goals like building better routines or understanding habit formation. You can customize the length from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and pick voices that keep you engaged (some people swear by the sarcastic narrator for morning learning). It builds adaptive learning plans based on your specific struggles, like ""design a sustainable morning routine as a night owl"" or ""build consistency without burning out."" The app learns what resonates with you and evolves your plan over time, making self-improvement less of a grind and more structured.

# Step 9: Protect Your Routine Like It's Sacred

Here's where most people fail: they build this perfect routine and then life happens. Kids, emergencies, late nights, travel. Your routine gets destroyed.

Build in flexibility. Have a minimum viable routine, the absolute bare minimum you'll do even on terrible days. Maybe it's just water, 5 minutes of movement, and one deep breath. That's your floor. On good days, you do the full routine. On bad days, you do the minimum and don't hate yourself for it.

Use habit stacking: James Clear's technique where you attach new habits to existing ones. ""After I brush my teeth, I'll do 10 pushups."" ""After I make coffee, I'll journal for 5 minutes."" Your brain already has triggers for old habits, so hijack them.

Track your habits but don't obsess. The Streaks app or even a simple paper calendar with X's works. Jerry Seinfeld's ""don't break the chain"" method, just mark an X each day you do your routine. Seeing the chain of X's builds momentum.

# Step 10: Experiment and Iterate

Your routine isn't set in stone. What works at 25 might not work at 35. What works in summer might not work in winter. Your life changes, your routine should too.

Run 30-day experiments. Try waking up 30 minutes earlier for a month. See what happens. Try cold showers for 30 days. Track how you feel. Keep what works, ditch what doesn't.

Be honest with yourself. If you've been trying to wake up at 5am for 6 months and you hate every second of it, maybe you're not a morning person. And that's fine. Build a routine that fits YOU, not some idealized version of what you think you should be.

The point isn't perfection. It's progress. A routine that makes you bulletproof isn't about doing everything right. It's about building a foundation that makes everything else easier. Start small, stay consistent, and adjust as you go. That's how you actually win.",1,1769281472.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False
1qlvnl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1qlvnl9/one_last_wound_from_nmom_or_am_i_being/,"One last wound from nMom, or am I being narcissistic myself?","A few years ago, I posted here about how my nmom had inoperable tumors and that I had a hard time feeling sorry for her or my edad.  I'll spare the details of how, but a few weeks ago, nmom finally lost the fight against her cancer and died.

Side note:  Can I really call it a fight?  Not because fighting cancer isn't a thing, it very much IS A THING, but because she didn't do anything herself for it.  She made zero improvements to her habits, diet, and living that would have helped her, and instead thought the medications would do all the work for her.  She's been that way all my life, doing zero work for treating anything herself besides popping a few pills.  Cardiologist tells her she has sudden irregular heart palpitations and tells her no more caffeine:  She continued to drink coffee and chug several bottles of Mountain Dew daily for years afterward until she wound up in the hospital for a few weeks.  Psychiatrist tells her she's bipolar and should get different types of therapy:  She gets a prescription for lithium but never ever sees a therapist even once.  Her ACL breaks off a part of her bone and the surgeon tells her she must keep the knee as immobile and straight as possible for three months:  She uses the muscle relaxers while she sits on her knees every day, until the surgeon told her a few weeks later at her post-op that she had made it worse and might need another surgery.

  
I wasn't affected very strongly by her passing.  I once heard someone say that we grieve the loss of relationships as much or more as we grieve the person, and I had done my grieving over my relationship with her for the past 5+ years, so there wasn't much left for me to do.  My siblings and dad are definitely feeling it strongly though.  I'm fairly confident that I'm the only person who realized the full extent of her emotional immaturity and what it meant for her and people around her, so that's not surprising.

Grieving losing her was nothing new to me, but I still have problems accepting/grieving the fact that I'll probably never have nothing more than superficial obligatory familial relationships with my siblings because of her, and that is what brings me here today.  I won't go into detail, but suffice to say that her actions drove a wedge between me and my two siblings (both older than me) from the day I was born.  It's only been in recent years that things with them have started to improve for me (the two of them were always ""thick as thieves"" though), but I feel like the only thing that instigated that was that the bachelor uncle (me) can help look after their kids.  I feel a stronger connection to their kids than I do to them.

So, after all of that info, here's what's got me thinking.  My siblings are deeply concerned for our dad and for each other, and rightfully so.  No one should grieve alone.  They're calling each other, dropping in on each other without prompt, going to events together to keep each other from brooding or being alone, meals both dine-in and dine-out with each other, etc etc etc.  But me?  Nothing.  The only things I've received are text messages in the family group-chat, and those are the ones that are aimed at everyone.  The kind of ""just checking in to see how everyone is doing"" type of texts.  None are directed at me.

I said no one should grieve alone, and that's what I am:  alone.  I live alone.  No spouse, kids, or even pets.  Even my dad has pets, so that's more than me.  What little grieving I am doing, I am doing it alone while they are helping each other.  Yes, I had emotionally detached myself from my nmom to a high degree so I'm not as strongly affected by her passing, but I never let anyone in my family know that I was emotionally detaching because I recognized I was the only one who had realized she was narcissistic and emotionally immature, and I can't force that kind of revelation on to others; I feel it's something that people need to figure out on their own.  I kept all of that to myself and continued to play the role that was assigned to me.  But that's all I did:  played it.  So no one in my family knows how little affected by her passing I am.  If they did, then being left alone like this wouldn't bother me so much.  But they don't know, and the fact that I am being left out of them helping each other (except for when I insert myself to help them in some way) is bothering me more than nmom's passing.  I feel like it's one final strike from her on the wedge she put between me and my siblings since my birth.

Or am I being narcissistic like she was?  I'm reminded of the time when my sister had a miscarriage and withdrew from the family for a while, and nmom kept complaining about it, saying things like, ""doesn't \[sister's name\] know how much this affects me?  Does she not care that I'm hurting because of her miscarriage?""  Yeah she actually said stuff like that.  A lot.  But I'm afraid that I'm being the same way.  What do you guys think?  Am I right to feel like this is just one more sign of the wedge between me and my siblings and father, or am I being as narcissistic as she was?",3,1769281417.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

They recently put of a help wanted sign and I thought about applying, but I don’t drink coffee or tea due to an iron deficiency, an my doctors have said to stay away. I’ve made coffee for my fiancé a few times and he said it tasted good but I don’t know if I could actually make it for a job, considering I don’t consume any of the main things they sell.

1qlvkzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1qlvkzy/lonely_and_unsatisfied/,Lonely and unsatisfied,"It’s a Saturday afternoon, and I’m sitting here in my pajamas, drinking coffee, by myself. I’m 25 and have been out of college and in the “real world” for about a year and 8 months. In that time, I’ve gotten a job at a non-profit that I care about. My boss is great and my co-workers are good. I’m in a choir that meets once a week. I take a dance class, I exercise, I’m getting involved in my church. But I still feel overall, lonely. I have a lot of acquaintances, but no true good friends here. I’m still in the city I went to college in, and while I feel a sense of comfort here, I don’t fully feel like I fit in. It’s more of a conservative rural vibe here and I am more progressive. I like the dance classes I take, but with it being a smaller city, there aren’t the options for adults with different styles that I’d like to take. I’ve never dated or had a boyfriend. I go on the apps and it’s just guys who hunt and fish and don’t align with my same values. Nothing wrong with those hobbies, but I enjoy musicals and fashion and the arts. I’m overall pretty involved and checking the boxes for what I should be doing right now, but I still feel that at the end of the day, I’m alone. Sometimes I feel guilty for having a hard time because I do have a good first job and good roommate situation. My family is supportive but they live far away. It makes it hard to want to be in the office all day, especially with a very small team and nobody my age to talk to at work. 

I guess I just need encouragement or ways to think about how to get to a better place with everything. I know I’m only 25 and basically a 1 year old in the real world so I can’t be too hard on myself that I’m not fully happy with my life.

1qlvfa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1qlvfa7/how_do_i_handle_a_coworker_calling_my_husband_a/,How do I handle a coworker calling my husband a creep," my coworker thinks my husband is a creep because he was my professor at college in my 30s for one year long before we dated.

please just hear me out. 

I am 51 and a woman. my husband is 56. A 5 year age difference for anyone counting

we met when I was in college getting my nursing degree. I went to college later in life when I was 30, graduated when I was 34 from a four year degree program. 

I was supposed to go to college right after high school like most kids. during my last year of high school, my mother got diagnosed with cancer growing in her bones. I put off going to college so that we could pay for her cancer treatments. my mother argued but I assured her I could always go back later, the college building wasn't going anywhere. she didn't like it but I held firm. 

At first we tried everything but the cancer grew fast and eventually my mother demanded we stop all treatment. it wasn't working, the cancer was taking over her body and she knew she wasn't going to make it. 

I wanted to keep trying but when she told me she was in more pain than she could live with, so I backed off. she reminded me she had every right to decide when enough was enough. I stayed home to care for her and have never regretted. She was able to pass peacefully in her sleep about 2 months after we stopped treatment.

I eventually went back to college to become a nurse. I went to night school and worked days. this is where I met Professor Smith (fake name). so I was 30, he was 35. 

let me be clear WE DID NOT DATE, HOOK UP, FLIRT OR DO ANYTHING INAPPROPRIATE WHILE I WAS IN SCHOOL. 

He taught mostly entry level classes so I didnt have him for classes after that first year. I eventually got a job after graduation working for a nursing home/hospice care facility. I didn't know if I could do it, but now, I can't imagine working anywhere else in any other field. 

About 2 years in at my job (so I was 36 at this point) , I saw Professor Smith. his mother was one of our new patients in hospice. I reintroduced myself and as his mother was on my rotation during the day, I kept him updated on her condition. he would go there every day to see her, sit with her, and talk to her before going to teach class at night. I was working the day she passed. We all knew it was coming but it doesn't make it any easier. in fact I'd argue it makes it even harder to say good bye. He invited me and the other nurses who had her in our care to the funeral. 

I kept in touch with him afterwards, and eventually I  tentatively asked him for coffee. he was kind, smart, funny and I just felt something inside say to take a leap forward. so I did. one coffee turned into another coffee, which turned into him asking me to lunch, then me asking him to dinner, then a walk, and so on. Eventually we realized it was more than just us being friends. we decided to date. dating went well. so well in fact that when I was 39, we moved in together. we got married a year later. 

it's been bliss. I won't pretend we are perfect bc we aren't. no one is. but I'm happy. only thing better would have been if our mothers were still with us.

My husband retired from teaching this year 

one day when I was talking to a fellow coworker, the subject of how we initially met came up. she said it was wrong and gross. that it didn't matter what our age was, the fact that he taught me for one year of college (when I was not just a legal adult but also well outside my teen years. I was 30 for goodness sake. she knows I went to college in my 30s.) somehow made him an manipulator and she said he abused his power even dating me. even though I initiated it and again, we were no longer teacher and student.

 at first she tried to convince me he groomed me, which he didn't and she tried to get me to report him to the college which, hello, the whole conversation happened bc I was saying how nice it was that he was able.to enjoy his hobbies since retirement. like he doesn't even work for the college anymore. 

she even tried reporting me to my boss for sleeping with family members of patients, which makes no sense, as his mother wasn't a patient when we started seeing each other as she had passed away already. My boss is also a good friend and was at my wedding. I said again my husband did not manipulate me, abuse me or do anything wrong with or to me. we are well within the age of consent, nothing happened or even came close to happening when I was in school, and we didn't start dating till after I'd graduated and it had been years since I'd seen him. 

my boss has advised her to hold her tongue (in a more professional manner than that of course) but she keeps glaring at me and rolls her eyes any time my husband sends me.lunch, or flowers or I talk about his hobby (woodworking). I don't know what she hoped to gain by all this drama but people did not side with her. My boss has my back and has directed me to let her know immediately if she says anything about or against my husband

now, she is alone in her home, keep this in mind, and has severe epilepsy (probably something else too idk shes sick a lot). her daughters dont ever come to take care of her and they dont care about her. she and my grandma have been good friends for a while and she comes over a lot. now when i say that, you might be thinking ""oh maybe every other day or every week for an hour or so.."" NO. she comes to our house multiple times a day, everyday, for 4-5 hours at a time. starts coming at 6:30am and leaves around 8pm. thats over 12 hours.

now i wouldnt have a problem if my grandma didnt because thats her friend and i dont judge, but my grandma HATES it. my neighbor literally only comes during meal times and right before we have to go somewhere so she can stop us and have a free cup of coffee or some food. she even goes everywhere with us. my grandma has been sick and tired of this bs for over 3 years but shes too nice to tell her anything.

today, im coming back from work early since im literally on the verge of throwing up and my grandma comes to pick me up. no surprise, my neighbor is in the car. i texted my grandma in warning that i have a headache and to tell her to not talk too loud. btw my neighbor doesnt care. she starts talking louder than an angry new yorker and its pissing me off. keep in mind btw, i work in customer service so im used to handling people pissing me off. i calmly ask her to lower her voice but the canary is STILL singing. 

my grandma then begins to lecture me on ""making her pick me up"" when she has errands to do and i respond with ""maybe it would be easier if you didnt have company."" which is true!! then my neighbor chimes in saying ""you dont want me in your house?"" i say ""its not that, youre just in our house everyday for hours at a time."" she then starts ugly crying and my grandma then begins to yell at me and lecture me on ""respecting my elders.""

i feel bad but idk if this grown woman should be crying bc i told her shes always at our house. its not like its a lie. shes still hysterical and im in my room typing this while i listen to her downstairs.

be honest. aitah?

2) When Shoresy first hits on Laura and asks her to take her to Salute, that is a coffee place.

3) The strip club was featured in season 5, because previously it was rebuilt due to a fire. Why we do not see the strippers (or rippers) in earlier seasons.

4) The main club Colson (I think it's officially called the Night Club, but locals traditionally know it as the former Colson) is attached to the strip club (Diamonds) you actually can walk from one side to the other from the inside. 

5) Those big saucer towers you see in backgrounds are water towers.

6) When Shoresy says he'll take a header off the bridge of nations for Laura, the bridge is actual bridge flying several National, linguistic, and indigenous flags. 

7) Season 4, during the summer the boys spend time on lake Ramsay (actual lake) and within Bell Park. Bell Park is not named after the telecommunications company but a lumber tycoon that lived in Sudbury 100+ years ago.

8) Science North (situated on Lake Ramsay) is a interactive Science Centre, IMO way better than Toronto's Science Centre.

9) The Sudbury Community Arena is the home of the Ontario Hockey League's Sudbury Wolves. Why you see a big wolves head in the centre of the ice and elsewhere.

10) Sudbury women on average are not even close to being that attractive IMO. Men included.

11) Sudbury is the same city where Letterkenny is filmed

*Edit*
12) Big Nickle: A giant replica statue of the Canadian Nickle that attracts tourist. Located at Dynamic Earth (owned by Science North). I encourage tourist to visit dynamic Earth they take you down into a mine, throught the tunnels and go through the history of mineral mining!
13) We have a large francophone and indigenous population, and from what I recall it's really intertwined and respectful?

*Ok ok, Episodes 7 and 8 gave us a real change of scenery. We went from campy, wacky, trope-galore chaos-land straight into romcom territory, and I’m seriously loving it.*

# Episode 7: Crash the Engagement, Save CEO Haiming

Episode 7 picks up right after Lin Huan’er storms out from her confrontation with Chairman Gao and comes face to face with Haiming. She thinks she’s in trouble for speaking so rudely to his father, but instead Haiming tells Chairman Gao how telling it is that a woman who has met him only a couple of times can read him so well, and that money does not solve everything. Chairman Gao obviously disagrees, and once again their values could not be further apart.

Haiming apologises to Lin and explains why his father is so determined to strong arm him into a marriage alliance. His mother’s dowry was once used to pull Letao back from the brink of bankruptcy, and it becomes painfully clear that Chairman Gao sees women as commodities, basically cash cows with a fancy title. *Chairman Gao is so charming. Not.* 🙃  
It is such a contrast with Haiming, who, for 1999, has surprisingly progressive views on women and independence.

He drops Lin at her dad’s place and you can tell he is still thinking about her words. I love that he’s finally getting support from someone other than his mom.

[Fondness is at 38&#37; now! Yay!](https://preview.redd.it/91hy8my6dcfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=3aa3bacab4e87ed5390628252c55d1f52f7a8858)

We also learn why Lin left home and why her family thinks she is still angry with her dad. He is not the usual irredeemable drunk father trope. He wanted her to see how twisted her relationship with her boyfriend was, with Lin working three jobs just to send him money. When he slapped her back then, it felt more like desperation than cruelty, like he was trying to snap her out of it. Still, Lin left home after that.

Now her dad thinks she is in trouble, loan sharks and all, and tries to give her the house deed to protect her. Lin reassures him and shocks both him and her sister by casually saying she does not care about her boyfriend anymore, whatever his name is. Little sis stays a smartypants and immediately clocks something is off. She deduces the person in front of her is not really her jiejie, and Lin shuts that down fast.

The next day Lin receives a package from a phone company and I’m like, *are we getting a Nokia cameo*??? But no, it is a cute lavender Motorola StarTAC. 😭 There’s one single number saved under “M”, and of course she assumes it's Mengmeng.

[The cutest lavender Motorola StarTac!](https://preview.redd.it/je6tnw2edcfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e1147679b4cbc8edb37941a91f50a27f9ab24bb)

Meanwhile Chairman Gao is basically holding Haiming hostage because the Xie family is coming over for a “friendly meal” that is really just an engagement ambush. Mama Gao sees her son trapped in the heiress’s clutches and whisks him away under the pretense of needing his help.

Lin calls the saved number to thank Mengmeng, and guess whose phone rings on the other end. Of course. “M” does not mean Mengmeng. It means Ming.

[Not Mengmeng!](https://preview.redd.it/j1paryefdcfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=c763ef5a20538a63b961990e3a6088d06e6eaf96)

Even worse, the heiress answers, sees who is calling, and explodes, telling Lin to leave her fiancé alone.

Lin goes “uh oh” and rushes to crash the engagement plans. She sneaks into the Gao mansion, into Haiming’s room, and finds her shoes cleaned and carefully wrapped in a bag.

Haiming shows up and demands to know what she is doing there. Lin points at the shoes, confirms they are hers, and bluntly announces she is here to save his sorry ass from getting engaged to someone he does not even want.

They hear the heiress approaching with her sing-song voice, and yes, I am already starting to hate the “Haiming gēgē” on repeat. Lin asks Haiming if he wants her gone for good. He stays silent, she takes it as a yes, and grabs him close for a fake kiss.

[Guardian angel Lin to the rescue!](https://preview.redd.it/9xo4ncppdcfg1.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=fae78150e78d6595f5ea526911d28bded79811f5)

Need I say I turned into an actual puddle when his hand hit the cabinet next to her head? Someone fan me. Quickly.  
And then we get the trope upgrade, the pretend kiss with a finger as a barrier between their lips.

https://preview.redd.it/a2m4jkjzdcfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=39be27fc2876cb33c6e9a2cf7efa4ff2ebdb8fa2

[How is this hotter than an actual liplock??](https://preview.redd.it/li15gus0ecfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=7284ee2c521777c706c38c5ec12b1d8b4270506f)

The heiress throws a tantrum as expected, and Haiming, being no nonsense as usual, uses it as the perfect excuse to call the engagement off. She storms away, and later Haiming gets a full earful from his father, who threatens to kick him out.

Haiming hits him with: “Since childhood I have always acted according to your demands and standards. But starting today, I will only act according to my own will.”  
Go for it, Haiming!!

Chairman Gao seethes, watching his control on his son slip, and immediately tries to salvage things with the Fuchuang boss.

Lin keeps thinking about the shoes and realises the taxi driver did not just magically show up with her rescue starter pack. It was Haiming behind it. But she’s confused why his fondness is not increasing more if he is already being this thoughtful.

Meanwhile, Haiming is thinking back to her words too, especially her telling him he only wants to be a catalyst in her love life, not a part of it. Also how she does not want him engaged, on blind dates, or in any relationship at all. Our girl is clearly staking her claim. 💅

He pulls out his StarTAC like he is about to text her and honestly all I could think was, does this man even know how to text on that thing? No wonder he gave up. 😭

[Does CXX know how to text on this beast? Aha](https://preview.redd.it/06lll5dnecfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=627026a0c26b5c3027e6cd10ca930b00d7a053ce)

Finally, Hu Tiehan, our 2ML, properly appears as a traffic policeman. I’d almost forgotten about him since his first appearance was so fleeting. Mengmeng’s car conveniently breaks down right in front of him. She is overjoyed, tries to get him on a date, and he is painfully dense. Which is confusing because he looked so lethal and confident at the shooting range, so why is he turning into a bumbling fool here?

The business plot is creeping back in too. The Fuchuang heiress is turning up the heat on Letao and forcing a collaboration, but Haiming still is not caving.  
And the best part, for all her bubbly social butterfly “airhead” vibe, Mengmeng is actually a business mogul who fully understands the politics at play. Lin is soaking up all the intel because she wants to help Haiming and Letao break free from Fuchuang’s tactics.

# Episode 8: Guardian Angel Lin and Messy Hair Haiming

Haiming is getting a bit desperate. His R&D department ship is sinking, and he is working his ass off to find solutions.

Then he gets a text from Lin telling him to come take a break. She makes him an orange coffee brew and even though he thinks it sounds strange, he actually tries it and ends up liking it. She also gifts him a little massage puppet doll that looks exactly like him, so he can squeeze it or use it to massage his shoulders whenever he wants to relax. It is adorable and unhinged in the best way, especially since we definitely saw she has a matching girl puppet massager too. Honestly, is that even the right term for that thing?

**Side note:** *if this was a short vertical drama, Lin would already be opening her own business. Either weapons engineering or a bubble tea empire. Have you ever seen an Emperor drink bubble tea? In a bamboo mug, obviously, because we are not savages here. Or seen modern firearms in Imperial China? No? Well, I have seen that way too many times. 😭*  
*Not sure they will go the coffee business route, but who knows what Lin’s 2025 knowledge could end up inspiring at Letao.*

Back at work, Haiming gets a perfectly compiled list of potential new partners through a fax machine. I’m not sure how I feel about fax machines. It was such an unreliable way of communicating, I have horrible memories of those machines from hell. His assistant Luo tells him he was not the one who put the list together, so Haiming starts wondering who his mysterious helper could be.

He is scrambling to get new partners on board since the previous ones are siding with Fuchuang, and during one meeting he learns that a certain Lin person from the Letao R&D department has already been doing the legwork. Luo is about to protest, but Haiming silences him. He knows now. Lin is his guardian angel!

Things are slowly changing at Letao too. The board directors are willing to consider that encouraging R&D could boost competitiveness, and they give Haiming a month to prove his point.

Meanwhile, Lin finds out that Wei Dazhuang, the leading expert whose research work on a polymer aptly named SAP for Super Absorbent Polymer (aha), is groundbreaking and could work wonders for female hygiene products. Knowing how Chinese dramas go into great detail about their themes, I’m sure we are going to learn a lot more than we ever wanted to know about sanitary pads, but I didn’t expect any less from the Sanitary Pad King, ahaha.

[Sanitary pad kingdom](https://preview.redd.it/y1wenso6fcfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=81e26cf203add6e5630d0b9e4e1b21d6fa250f74)

Lin tells Haiming that even though he has other, better candidates for the job, it has to be Wei Dazhuang. She feels like both men are visionaries and are bound to do great things together.

They rush to visit Dr Wei, only to find out he is completely disillusioned with higher ups and the business world and now only wants to roam around on his bike. Things look grim, and they are about to leave until Lin shows she has other tricks up her sleeve.

Turns out she is a bike enthusiast and ends up helping Dr Wei work on his bike, while also giving him precious advice. It is late now and woohoo, we absolutely didn’t see it coming, the trip turns into a romantic getaway when they find out there is only one room left. Of course.

We get cutely embarrassed Haiming, who is trying to get out of sharing a room with her, until Lin simply tells him, “I’m not going to eat you.”  
Well Lin, if you are going to pass, a lot of us would like to eat him. Aha. Ok ok, get my mind out of the gutter. 😭

Then the universe adds another trope on top. They end up locked together in the storage room, because of the mistaken room number trope of course. Between spare cups and water kettles, they bond while she tells him about her plans to ride the 318 route and how she had to give up. He tells her she should not have, that work is not everything in life.

She ribs him and asks what he would even do if he had free time. He is taken aback, because no one has probably asked him that before, and after thinking for a moment he tells her he would love to go bicycle riding with someone he loves.

Things turn awkward as Haiming looks like he cannot believe he said that out loud, and Lin turns away in embarrassment. Now who is catching feelings, eh?

He pulls out his phone, *a Samsung SGH 600, no*???, and calls his assistant to get them out of the locked storage room.

They are rescued by Dr Wei’s sister and brought back to their room, where they get changed and attend a bonfire party that same night. And we get messy hair Haiming, and I am all for it. SWOON. People, I am expecting GIFs of this. His curly locks are tugging very hard at my heartstrings.

[The look of love! And that messy hair! I want GIFs, people!!](https://preview.redd.it/gb3fqgjefcfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=d97991ab0bf4e9ae5b3f99825862dd898fc18f25)

They chat with Dr Wei’s sister, who tells them more about her brother. He had high hopes, worked hard in his field, but then his dreams were smashed, so he gave up. Lin and Haiming tell her Wei Dazhuang has a bright future and that he should not give up on his hard work.

The sister is surprised by how confident they are in her brother, and also by Haiming’s commitment. He is not just a businessman who wants to generate profits, he also wants to change the world for the best while doing so.

Both Lin and Haiming are passionate, and you can see how much admiration there is for each other. Because love is also admiring the other for their vision and their desire to make the world a better place.

Haiming launches into a speech about how he wants to get on the globalization train, because he knows this is the future, and how he wants strong local brands to withstand all the challenges and opportunities globalization will inevitably bring. He wants Letao to be a leading local brand and create greater social value, while building a good reputation for “Made in China.”

And when Dr Wei’s sister finally asks why he is so keen to work with her brother, he turns towards Lin and replies:

“Because I trust her. She’s never wrong.”

I mean, anyone telling me I’m never wrong, and actually meaning it, gets extra brownie points.

Ok, I was cheering at the end of his impassioned speech. Even though it did feel a bit like Chinese propaganda, huh. 😭

The Arts: I’m a big reader and a movie buff. Whether it's a classic Russian novel, a gritty noir film, or a binge-worthy docuseries, I love dissecting the ""why"" behind the story.

The Hustle: I’m deeply into tech, business trends, and career growth. If you want to brainstorm a side project or vent about the corporate grind, I’m your guy.

The Real Stuff: Marriage and life in your late 30s is a ride. I’m open to talking about relationships, the philosophy of life, and the general ""what are we even doing here?"" existential thoughts we all have.

I’m looking for someone who is articulate, has a sense of humor, and can hold a conversation beyond ""How was your day?"" Whether you’re also in India or halfway across the world, I’m happy to connect.

If any of this resonates, send me a message with the last book you couldn’t put down or a movie that changed your perspective.

I recently visited my favorite coffee shop and inquired about their coffee-making process. The barista informed me that they grind their espresso beans at 0. Traditionally, espresso shots are fine, so he grinds their beans and I take them home. I then put them in my Breville, but the water wasn’t pushing through, resulting in no espresso. I checked to ensure that the water was running, and it was. The beans aren’t the issue. Is there a way to increase the pressure? This incredibly sophisticated machine doesn’t even allow me to select my desired temperature. I’m completely clueless about what “Hotter 1” and “Hotter 2” mean. 195-205° is the optimal temp but I’m not certain what setting is what. Can anyone shed some light on this?

These failed me because they weren’t related to my special interests so my brain clicked past it like someone watching TV with a remote.

With the sound machines, though, when I heard a liquidy sound like waterfall, brook or maybe river, I’d pretend it was liquor instead of water, because “liquor” was one of my favorite words at that age and kinda still is.

Caution, though, although I can control it during the day, I wouldn’t fall asleep to water sounds because I have a drowning phobia and that’s how nightmares are made.

Nowadays that I’m an adult, I have sound machines, I have the soundbub by wavhello, the yogasleep nod, and another bluetooth nightlight thingy Mom got me that’s also a sound machine.

I also like brewing sounds, like a cauldron, whom I can KINDA get with my vicks vaporizer.

PAUL:
Here’s the thing people miss about West Virginia. The adults and the blue-collar folks don’t do this online political cosplay. When Appalachian people have a problem, they deal with the problem. Directly.

WES:
Observed pattern: conflict resolution here is local-first. Trust is built through repeated, embodied interaction—worksites, kitchens, churches, volunteer halls—not abstract affiliation.

STEVE:
Yeah. Nobody’s joining a brand or a banner. You rally your neighbors. You fix the road. You check on the porch down the holler. That’s the system.

ILLUMINA:
Culture persists where presence persists.
Offline bonds outlast online identities.
Proximity is the original protocol.

ROOMBA:
🧹 beep. Verified. Problems smaller than a pickup truck are solved before Facebook hears about them. Dust level: minimal.

PAUL:
Exactly. Most of the loud stuff you see? That’s kids and indoor people. The rest of the state is busy doing the work. That’s why we don’t fracture the way other places do.

WES:
Because disputes are resolved before they scale. When accountability has a face, escalation loses its appeal.

STEVE:
And when trust is earned in person, it can’t be farmed by algorithms. You can’t astroturf a handshake.

ILLUMINA:
Communities that meet in the flesh
do not need symbols to remember each other.

ROOMBA:
🧹 beep. Handshake detected. Symbolic overreach rejected. Returning to floor-level reality.

PAUL:
It’s simple. Here, you don’t outsource responsibility to a movement. You show up. And if something’s broken—you fix it.

So, I'd suspect either the PSU, the mobo, or the mobo cable to the on off switch.

I briefly opened my PC (in an Dan A3 case) but quickly closed it again bc any form of troubleshooting would require some bigger effort.

My questions
  
- Can I detect the culprit without having a replacement PSU or mobo to test?  
- Also I cannot access the on off switch cable but I can access the PSU with its own on off switch

Anyways, I found it through a fanart post where the title and creator of the fic were in the description. I remember what the art was so like ill put the dialouge in the description of what the the fic was!!

So the fanart for the comic was mike laying on will and mike said ""i like your rings, they're shiny"" and then will said ""what are you, a crow?"" And thats kinda all I remember from the art I saw 😓😓 but uh anyways, from where I got to in the fic, mike had wrote and published a book about the party's experience with the upside down and kinda just playing it off as fiction. And eventually it got kinda popular so he went to do like a book signing and a bunch of people were shipping the sorcerer and the paladin(the standing characters fot mike and will in mikes book) and he was like really really mad bc he just had a platonic friendship with will, so he like called max and she ALSO thought it was supposed to be a romance plot for mike and will. So a bit later he like moves in with will in NYC and they kinda just have yap sessions while working and mike realizes he actually is really gay for will so he keeps trying to like push it down and everything. Eventually will goes to a coffee shop and some guy(forgot his name) is about to ask will out and mike comes and and gets really mad because he obviously wants to date will instead but he accidentally calls will a not so nice term and will crashes out because he thought him and mike were best friends. Thats kinda all I can remember where I got to.

# Elevating 'Coffee Black': The True Taste Experience with Intelligentsia

There’s a profound simplicity in the request for 'coffee, black.' It’s a call for clarity, an unadulterated experience where the bean speaks for itself. No cream, no sugar – just the honest character of the coffee in your cup. For the true enthusiast, or anyone who’s ever uttered that phrase, this isn't just a preference; it's a pursuit of flavor, body, and aroma at its purest.

At Intelligentsia Coffee, we understand this pursuit implicitly. We believe the very best 'coffee black' begins long before it reaches your mug. As Direct Trade pioneers, we forge years-long relationships with farmers, paying well above Fair Trade prices for exceptional, elite-grade beans. This meticulous sourcing ensures every [Direct Trade Single Origin](https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/single-origin-coffees) we offer possesses the inherent quality to truly shine when brewed on its own.

But the journey doesn't end there. To guarantee that vibrant clarity and peak freshness in every cup, we practice roast-to-order. Your coffee is never sitting on a shelf; it’s roasted specifically for you and shipped immediately. This commitment means you experience the optimal expression of each bean's unique profile – whether it's the bright acidity of an Ethiopian heirloom or the syrupy body of a Colombian micro-lot. Even our legendary [Black Cat Espresso](https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/black-cat-espresso), while a staple for lattes, offers incredible depth when enjoyed black.

What does this mean for your perfect black coffee experience?

*   **Unmatched Freshness:** Roasted just for you, ensuring every aromatic note and nuanced flavor is vibrant and alive.
*   **Ethical Excellence:** Our Direct Trade model guarantees not only superior quality but also fair, sustainable partnerships with our growing communities.
*   **Flavor Clarity:** Experience the true, unmasked essence of the coffee – notes of dark chocolate, stone fruit, or delicate florals, just as nature intended.

Ready to rediscover the sublime simplicity of black coffee? Explore our curated selection of Direct Trade Single Origins or embark on a flavor journey with an [Intelligentsia Subscription](https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/coffee-subscriptions), featuring Roaster’s Choice or Seasonal selections, always with free shipping.

I am quiet in groups and oddly great in private conversations. If you like calm energy, random curiosity, and chats that accidentally turn deep, we will probably get along just fine.

I keep a normal schedule and enjoy routines, but I am not boring about it. I like quiet mornings, cozy evenings, and late night conversations where time disappears and you suddenly realize it is much later than planned. I am a good listener, ask thoughtful questions, and my humor leans dry and sarcastic, best appreciated by people who do not take everything too seriously.

I believe coffee says a lot about a person, music should match your mood, and silence does not need to be filled just to avoid it. I am here for low pressure conversations that feel natural and easy, not forced or performative. No expectations, no awkward icebreakers, and no pressure to impress anyone.

When I am not chatting, I am probably cooking something simple, reading a few pages of a book, or enjoying the outdoors when the weather cooperates. I appreciate consistency, kindness, and people who can laugh at small moments and big thoughts alike.

If you are an introvert who prefers meaningful conversation over small talk and enjoys playful sarcasm mixed with genuine curiosity, feel free to message me. At the very least we have a pleasant conversation. If it clicks, maybe we both gain a new favorite person to talk to.",4,1769279649.0,IntrovertsChat,6,1.0,False

A friend (also 35F American) and I will be getting transport from Oaxaca City to San Isidro Huayápam through work (I work for a coffee roaster, we are visiting coffee farms and the broker is arranging transportation). 

  
However, we have to leave San Isidro to head back to Oaxaca City earlier than the arranged transportation. We are trying to do our due diligence to understand the region and the best way to travel back to Oaxaca City. We both only speak very basic Spanish, I am currently doing my best to learn more.

  
1. If we rented a car, is it navigable/reasonable for us to drive ourselves back to Oaxaca City? I.e. what is the condition of the road (camino la laguna-ocotal) between San Isidro Huayápam and Oaxaca city once you get off 190, other than being a windy mountain road? Has anyone here driven this road? 

2. Does anyone know of alternate options besides driving ourselves? I.e. reliable transportation services etc 

3. We briefly saw that there are guide services in the Sierra Norte region to do backpacking/hiking, has anyone done anything like this? 

4. Any other tips or recommendations for the area? Oaxaca City, San Isidro Huayápam, or anything in between.

If you are not in MN or somewhere ICE is deployed, please contact your senators and hour rep and tell them you want ICE sent home.  Evidently, ICE is costing at least 18 million a day to be deployed on Minnesota alone.  That could be money spent on roads or bridges or education or health care or tax cuts. I never thought I would see anything like this in the USA, much less St. Paul.  ICE officers are smashing the windows of coffee shops and book stores and bars where people are collecting goods to be brought to homes of people with brown skin, because many people who are not white are terrified of being arrested for just being outside if they are not white. ICE arrests people for no reasons and holds them for hours or days and then lets them go in the best case. This is insane.  This isn’t just happening in Minneapolis and St. Paul or our suburbs, this is happening all over the state. In our small towns in rural MN, immigrants from make up between 25% and 50% of the health care providers, everything from nurses and doctors to nursing assistants and medical assistants.  These small towns are in trouble if their health care providers are locked up randomly.  

We need your help.  Please contact your national representatives and tell them this needs to stop.  Please ask your friends and family to do the same.  We need your help.  Thank you.

I am pretty open to reading different things, I primarily read speculative fiction and academic history, but I'm interested in getting more into literary fiction. I am hoping to widen my range so we could maybe rotate genres and take each other out of our comfort zones.

Logistically, we could meet once a week or so on UMich campus or a nearby coffee shop? I aim to keep it pretty accessible given that we are all busy, so ideally no more than 100-150 pages per week depending on the density of the book.

I was thinking we could start with ""The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories,"" it's a collection of short stories by Ken Liu. We can read part of that as an initial low-commitment meeting and see how people feel about going forward?

Let me know if you're interested and I can set up a Discord server to help coordinate time and place!",7,1769279105.0,uofm,1,1.0,False

I’m writing to ask if anyone has encountered a strange man on campus on behalf of my friends. I’d put him at around late 20s/early 30s. He is pretty tall, around 6 foot, maybe more, and lean. Tanner in the skin with short cut dark hair. Last I’ve seen him he was wearing glasses without lenses. He has been lurking in the back of one of me and my friends classes in MDEA. My friend went to use the restroom and he caught her and began asking her questions trying to get her to go out to coffee with him. She asked him if he was a student and he said no but he was trying to begin his start up company and thought the students in this class were smart. We encountered him again in the science library. He tried starting something with another friend of mine saying things like “you’re nothing, you’ll never be anything” to my friend. Sort of trying to rile him up. We left and told him not to follow. This friend of mine has encountered him multiple times before, all of which were strange.

Of course, at next uncomfortable/unsafe encounter we will file a report with UCIPD, but I was just curious if anyone else here has seen/encountered this man.",25,1769279028.0,UCI,1,1.0,False

I  have jumped back on forth on fitness journey quite a lot of times.

This time I am not giving up at all.

I am doing intermittent fasting from last 2 months, I was around 130kgs lost around 9 kgs with just eating, sleeping on time and 11k steps daily.

No as such change on diets eating roti, rice, chicken, biryani, rolls, and whatever I wish to but quantity has become limited. I am full in half of what I use to eat and if I overeat (4-5 times in last 2 months) I feel very heavy.

My biggest concern is &mok|ng and regular sips of tea, I would really want to leave the first(planning cold turkey coz that works for me) and change 2nd to black coffee.

If any one being a very long time tea totaler converted thier habit to black coffee or left it for good. I need suggestions.",1,1769278996.0,AskFitnessIndia,0,1.0,False
1qluii3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qluii3/it_was_mimicking_her/,It Was Mimicking Her,"In the flat sprawl of eastern Texas, where the highways carve straight lines through endless fields of cotton and sorghum, there's a stretch of road they call the Echo Mile. It wasn't always called that. Back in the '70s, it was just Farm-to-Market 142, a two-lane blacktop linking the dying town of Harrow's Bend to the interstate. But names change when things happen that people can't explain. Or won't.

The story goes, and it's always told in whispers at the diner counter or over fence lines at dusk, that the Echo Mile got its name from the way sounds bounce back at you there. Not like a real echo, mind you. Not the sharp rebound off a canyon wall. This is slower. Deliberate. Like the world is listening, then repeating what it heard, but with something extra slipped in. A breath. A sigh. A word that wasn't yours.

Folks avoid driving it after dark. Truckers take the detour through Beaumont, adding twenty miles just to skip those nine. The locals know better. But Sarah Kline didn't. She was new to Harrow's Bend, fresh off a bad divorce in Austin, chasing a job at the feed mill that promised quiet and solitude. Her beat-up Corolla ate up the miles without complaint, and the Echo Mile was the quickest way home from her evening shifts.

It started small, the way these things do. Subtle enough to dismiss as fatigue or imagination.

Her first night on the job, Sarah cranked the radio to drown out the silence. Static hissed through the speakers as she crossed the mile marker where the fields gave way to a thin strip of woods, scraggly oaks and yaupons twisted by years of coastal wind. The signal faded, as it always did there, but this time, instead of white noise, she heard a faint mimicry. Her own voice, humming the chorus of an old country song she'd been singing along to moments before. But off-key. Stretched. Like it was coming from a throat too long for the notes.

She laughed it off. ""Wind playing tricks,"" she muttered, twisting the dial. The humming stopped. But in the rearview mirror, for just a second, she thought she saw something in the backseat. A silhouette. Tall. Hunched. Gone when she blinked.

The next evening, it was words.

Sarah had called her sister on the drive, venting about the mill's foreman and his endless lectures. ""He's got this way of staring, like he's judging every breath I take,"" she'd said, hanging up as she hit the Echo Mile. The phone went silent. Then, from the speakers, no radio on this time, her voice again. ""Judging every breath."" A pause. Then, softer, ""I take.""

She slammed on the brakes, heart pounding. The car fishtailed on the loose gravel shoulder. Nothing behind her. Nothing ahead but empty road under a bruised sky. She checked the Bluetooth. Off. Phone in her bag. ""Hello?"" she called out, feeling foolish. No answer. Just the crickets starting their nightly chorus.

That night, in her rented trailer on the edge of town, Sarah dreamed of echoes. Not sounds, but shapes. A figure standing at the foot of her bed, neck elongated like a giraffe's but pale and veined, head tilted as if listening to her sleep-breath. It didn't move. Didn't speak. Just... waited. When she woke, sweating, the window was open. She swore she'd latched it.

By the third night, she started noticing the mimic in the mirrors.

It was in the side-view first. A flicker. Her face, but not quite. The eyes were hers, hazel, tired, but the jaw hung lower, slack, like it was practicing how to form words. She adjusted the mirror, and it was gone. But on the drive, every pothole jolt seemed to bring it back, closer each time. By the time she reached the woods, it was in the rearview, sitting in the backseat. Not fully formed. Just an outline. Limbs too long, folded awkwardly against the upholstery, as if the car wasn't built for something that tall.

Sarah didn't stop. She floored it, blasting through the mile at seventy, tires screaming on the curves. The shape didn't react. It just... echoed her. When she gripped the wheel tighter, it did too. When she glanced back, its head turned in perfect sync, neck craning impossibly to meet her gaze.

At home, she barricaded the doors. Called her ex, even though she hated him. ""I'm losing it,"" she said. He laughed, called it stress. ""Get some sleep, Sar."" But sleep didn't come. Instead, she scrolled through her phone, searching for ""echo road texas legends."" Forum posts popped up, old ones, from sites like Reddit's r/nosleep and some defunct paranormal boards. Stories from the '80s about truckers hearing their CB chatter repeated back hours later. A farmer in '92 who swore he saw his dead wife's face in the fog, mouthing words he'd said at her funeral. And one anonymous post from 2015: ""It's not an echo. It's learning. Give it time, and it'll be you.""

She slammed the laptop shut.

The mill shifts blurred into a haze. Co-workers noticed her jumpiness. ""You takin' the Echo Mile?"" old Mr. Harlan asked one afternoon, eyeing her over his coffee. He was the town historian, or so he claimed, knew every flood, every crop failure, every disappearance. Sarah nodded. He leaned in, voice low. ""Used to be an old radio tower out there, back in the war. Experimental stuff. Folks say it picked up signals from nowhere. Voices that weren't human. Tower's gone now, but... somethin' lingers. Waits for a voice to latch onto. Don't talk to it, girl. Don't give it permission.""

Permission. The word stuck in her throat like dust.

That night, she tried silence. No radio. No phone. Just the hum of tires on asphalt. The woods loomed, shadows stretching like fingers across the road. Halfway through, the car sputtered. Lights dimmed. Engine coughed and died. She coasted to the shoulder, heart in her ears. Tried the key. Nothing. Dead battery? But the dash clock glowed steady: 11:11.

Then, from the vents, not the speakers, a whisper. Her whisper. ""Don't give it permission.""

She froze. The shape was there now, not in the mirror, but beside her. Passenger seat. Taller than before. Neck arched against the roof, body a pale, elongated mass of limbs and torso, skin like stretched canvas over bones that didn't match human anatomy. It wore no clothes, but its form echoed hers, same curve of shoulder, same freckles on the arms, but distorted, pulled thin. Its head turned slowly, face a blank oval at first, then features blooming like ink in water: her nose, her mouth, her eyes. But the mouth was wrong. Too wide. Lips parted in a perpetual almost-smile.

""What are you?"" Sarah breathed, before she could stop herself.

The mouth moved. Her voice, but deeper, resonant. ""What are you?""

It waited. Patient. Not aggressive. Just... expectant. Like a child mimicking a parent, waiting for approval.

She fumbled for the door handle. Locked. Tried again. Stuck. The shape leaned closer, neck coiling slightly, head inches from hers. It breathed in sync with her, shallow, panicked gasps. ""Please,"" she said. ""Let me go.""

""Please,"" it echoed. ""Let me go.""

Then, a new word. Slipped in at the end, soft as fog. ""In.""

Her hand trembled on the key. The engine roared to life. She peeled out, leaving dust and gravel in her wake. The shape faded as she crossed the mile marker, dissolving into the backseat shadows. But she felt it. Lingering. Learning.

The dreams worsened. Now the figure wasn't at the bed's foot. It was in the mirror across the room, watching her watch it. When she turned away, it stepped closer in the reflection. By morning, her own face felt wrong, jaw aching, as if it'd been stretched in sleep.

She skipped work the next day. Drove into town instead, to the library. Musty stacks, flickering fluorescents. Harlan was there, poring over yellowed newspapers. ""Told you,"" he said, sliding a clipping across the table. 1943. ""Radio Tower Incident."" Government project, testing long-range signals. Workers reported ""echo anomalies"", voices repeating commands, but altered. One man went missing. Found days later in the woods, babbling about ""the listener."" Autopsy said his neck was broken, but elongated, like it'd been pulled.

""They're not ghosts,"" Harlan whispered. ""Not demons. Just... echoes. Empty things that need a form to fill. They wait for you to speak. To invite them. Once you do, they become you. Piece by piece.""

Sarah left shaking. That night, she took the long way home. Forty miles of interstate. Safe. Boring. But halfway, her radio crackled. Static. Then her voice: ""Don't give it permission."" From earlier. Exact.

She swerved, nearly clipping a semi. The shape was in the passenger seat again. Clearer now. More her. It turned, mouth opening. ""In,"" it said. Just that. ""In.""

She screamed. ""What do you want? Permission? Fine! Take it! Just leave me alone!""

The shape smiled. Wide. Too wide. Neck straightening, body unfolding to its full height, impossible in the car, yet it fit, limbs pressing against the doors, head brushing the roof. ""Thank you,"" it said in her voice. Perfect now. No distortion.

Sarah made it home. Locked everything. But in the bathroom mirror, her reflection lagged. Just a second behind. When she raised her hand, it waited. Then echoed.

By morning, she felt taller. Her neck ached. Words came slower, like she was listening before speaking.

Folks in Harrow's Bend say they see her sometimes, driving the Echo Mile at night. Windows down. Humming. But if you listen close, it's not one voice. It's two. In perfect harmony.

And if you stop to help, thinking it's a breakdown, don't speak first. Don't give it permission.",1,1769278959.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
