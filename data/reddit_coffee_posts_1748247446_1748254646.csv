I’m in the early stages of opening a coffee store in Karachi and I’m looking for a reliable supplier who can provide high-quality coffee beans — preferably freshly roasted and ideally locally sourced or imported premium beans.

I’m aiming to serve specialty-grade coffee, so I'm looking for something better than the usual commercial-grade stuff. If you’ve had a great experience with a local roaster or know of any wholesale suppliers (whether they're based in Karachi or ship to Karachi), I’d love your recommendations.

So far, I've heard of places like Suave, Green Bean Coffee, and Grao — but I want to make sure I explore all the best options.

Appreciate any leads or advice!

Thanks in advance.",1,1748254386.0,karachi,0,1.0,False

I usually follow a 16-8 intermittent fasting diet and control my weight well, but recently I gained a lot of weight and reached 94 kilos. I believe in benefits of fasting and hunger and finally started a 30-day water fast.

Today is my 12th day, I only drink water, coffee, black or green tea and lots of mineral water. Sometimes I add lemon and salt to mineral water.

I have lost 7.5 kilos so far. Of course, fasting is a bit boring, not being able to join family or office meals is psychologically difficult. Apart from that, when it comes to physical effects, I do not have any concrete problems other than insomnia (I think it is due to the body getting used to getting all its energy from ketones). 

I will share the developments. Comments provide strength and motivation.

Love,

P.s: I recommend that anyone who wants to try it should do so under the supervision of a doctor.",1,1748254354.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

1kvqpnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1kvqpnp/a_message_to_your_heart_thats_tired/,A message to your heart that's tired.,"
Lately, I’ve been walking around feeling like someone’s wrapped a sheer piece of gauze between me and the world. Not the kind that blocks beauty altogether, but the kind that gently mutes it like seeing a sunrise through an old lace curtain your sister insisted wasn’t tacky, just “vintage.” Everything’s still there, the colour, the light  just blurred at the edges, like a dream I almost remember.

Naturally, I did what any person with a Wi-Fi connection and an apetite for overthinking does: I spiraled. Is this what they call burnout? Low iron? Low-grade depression? Am I not doing enough exercise? Not journaling enough?Not doing it enough? I started ticking things off in my mind like a malfunctioning life coach: More cardio? Less scrolling? Morning pages? Moon water?

But here’s the thing, this isn’t just my “personal problem,” is it? It’s a very natural response to living in a world where headlines are sharper than knives and everyone’s shouting and no one’s listening. It's a natural reaction when the news reads more like dystopian fiction and less like an update. When cruelty is signed into law with pens that cost more than my entire monthly budget , and people are applauded for looking away while others starve well, it makes sense that the heart feels… tender. 

And I realise now  my heart isn't malfunctioning. It’s doing exactly what it should: reacting to the ache, the injustice, the sheer noise of it all. Maybe your heart’s doing that too. And maybe that’s not something to fix. Maybe it's something to witness.


In this soft, sore-hearted space I find myself in, I’ve noticed how quickly I fall into the trap of personalising everything. As if I’m a project, or worse, a Pinterest board titled “Fix Yourself in 30 Days or Less.” But the world’s sorrow is not a personality flaw. Grief is not the issue. Rage doesn’t make me broken,it makes me awake.

I’m learning slowly, clumsily to cradle what hurts instead of trying to banish it like an unwanted guest . I’m letting the ache sit beside me on the couch, and sip my coffee . I’m reminding myself:

Grief doesn’t need to be productive to be valid. It just needs time.
(crying out loud because processing grief for me was also just trying to make a research topic so my processing could be productive)

Your rage isn’t unbecoming. It’s a flare in the dark, saying “This matters.”
You don’t need to be a fortress. Be a field. Let the wind move through you.
You’re not failing because you feel. You’re just… human. And fuck everyone who says elsewise 

There is beauty, yes but sometimes it feels like it’s behind frosted glass. That doesn’t mean it’s gone. It just means maybe your heart needs tending first. Maybe the ache is simply asking to be acknowledged, not erased.

Finding the Way,(and several missed exits)

Sometimes, I think we’ve been taught that being emotionally numb is maturity. But numbness is just another word for disconnection. And if my heart still hurts when it sees cruelty, if it still breaks open in the presence of love or loss, then maybe that’s not a weakness. Maybe that’s my compass.

Yes, it’s easier to stay neutral, to stay likeable, to keep your head down. But neutrality is not always kindness. And silence is not always peace. When your heart calls you to speak, speak. Even if your voice trembles. 

Remember: Beauty will wait for you. It always does. It’s stubborn that way.


So here we are, you and I hearts sore but still beating, eyes a little foggy but still searching for the light. Maybe the answer isn’t in “fixing” any of it. Maybe it’s in letting ourselves feel all of it. Maybe it’s in long talks with people who make us laugh until we wheeze . In crying for no particular reason. In a warm hug. In a hot waffle . In actions to change, not just self-care.

May you be soft with yourself in the places that still ache.
May your grief be a doorway, not a dead end.
May your humanity be messy and magnificent and absolutely un-optimized.

May you let your imperfect, radiant self simply be  a little broken, a little brilliant, and beautifully alive.

And if nothing else, take a breath.
Then another.
Then one more.
I’m right here, breathing with you.

I always read these posts and this particular story pops into my head. 

When my children were little I used to take them to a children’s centre where they would do singing, forest school and artwork. They loved it, I loved it. 

The centre had a little coffee shop run by volunteers who didn’t mind if you brought a packed lunch for your children to eat while you had your coffee. 

On this particular day, my daughter had a tub of grapes in her lunchbox and was really enjoying them. (I should add this was before the recommendation parents cut grapes in half to prevent a child choking.) It was at this point entitled mummy walks up and tells me to put the tub of grapes away in case her child “eats one and chokes.” Being a people pleaser I apologise and pack away my daughter’s grapes. 

It is only when I’m leaving I realise the ridiculousness of what the EM said to me. Why would her child be eating my daughter’s grapes? I took my daughter to the park and had an ice cream to make up for my lack of awareness afterwards.

1. A larger gym like an Equinox or Powerhouse. There are other smaller fitness options which can be great but the only full-sized gym in SOMA is the Blink in South Orange, which also seems to be on the smaller side.

2. A large cafe. There is Arties and a couple of options across town; but Springfield Ave could use a large knockout coffee shop of its own.

3. A China buffet. The closest ones are all the way in Newark-Ironbound and Linden. 

4. An LGBT bar or club as SOMA has a strong LGBT presence.

5. A supermarket option would also be nice but I don’t know if the commercial space could accommodate that. I’d even take a smaller one like an Aldi’s.

In the quiet garden of the Chandler family, a yell broke the silence. ""Ms. Chandler fell in the pool!""

Instantly, chaos broke out. Everyone watched as Yvette Chandler flailed in the water—including Sophia Chandler, Yvette's sister. Sophia stood frozen at the edge, too stunned to move.

The commotion brought guests running from the party. Before Sophia could react, a finger pointed straight at her. ""Sophia pushed her! She did this!""

Heather Chandler—mother to both girls—arrived just in time to hear the accusation. Without thinking, she grabbed Sophia and slapped her hard across the face.

The slap left Sophia's cheek stinging. The sharp crack still vibrated in her ears as she stared at Heather in shock.

""Mom—"" Sophia tried to speak, her voice shaking as she stepped forward.

Heather's eyes burned with anger. ""Don't call me that,"" she snapped. ""No daughter of mine would do such a thing.""

Sophia turned to face her three brothers. Dressed in their fine suits, they glared at her like she was the enemy.

""Sophia, if Yvette's hurt, you'll pay."" The first brother's voice trembled with rage.

The second shook his head in disgust. ""I knew you were trouble, but this? Attacking Yvette at her own banquet?""

""Yvette's suffered enough,"" the third spat, fists clenched. ""After eighteen years apart, this is how you welcome her? What did she ever do to deserve this?""

""Sophia, Yvette is your sister! How could you do that?"" the first brother demanded.

Sophia's cheek still burned from the slap. She shook her head wildly, insisting, ""I didn't push her. I swear it wasn't me.""

Their answering silence was worse than words. Jackets hit the pavement as all three brothers plunged into the pool to rescue Yvette.

When they pulled Yvette out, she was drenched and shaking. One brother wrapped his coat around her, and they all gathered close, shielding her and murmuring words of comfort.

Yvette stood there with red-rimmed eyes and a pale face, trembling like a frightened bird. ""Mom, it wasn't Sophia's fault,"" she said softly. ""I just slipped.""

Then she glanced at Sophia, her whole body flinched like she'd been struck. With a frightened gasp, she shrank back into her brothers' arms, clinging to them like a life raft.

Every guest got the message loud and clear—Sophia had tried to hurt the fragile girl they'd just gotten back.

Yvette hung her head, tears dripping down. ""Maybe I shouldn't have come back... Then Sophia wouldn't..."" Her voice broke into sobs.

The Chandlers shot dagger looks at Sophia, furious at what they thought she'd done, but aching for poor Yvette.

Heather's eyes glistened. ""Oh, Yvette, you're too good,"" she murmured, crushing Yvette in a hug. ""My sweet girl. I spent eighteen years searching for you. Hearing you say that... it breaks my heart.""

Yvette clung to Heather, her voice trembling as she cried, ""I'm sorry, Mom. I just don't want to upset Sophia.""

The guests exchanged heavy glances, a collective sigh hanging in the air. All eyes turned to Sophia, their gazes thick with disapproval and doubt.

""After all Yvette's been through,"" someone said under their breath. ""Taken at two, missing eighteen years. This homecoming should've been perfect. Sophia wrecked it.""

""Always so icy, that one,"" another whispered. ""Like a ghost—never talks, just watches. She really gives me chills.""

""Not like Yvette,"" a third added. ""Top student at Halinston University and this year's highest-scoring STEM graduate. Raised in some small town, but she's every bit a Chandler.""

""And Sophia?"" someone snorted. ""Had everything handed to her. Still can't measure up.""

Howard Chandler, the third son, stood stiffly as the whispers continued. His hands began to shake—first slightly, then uncontrollably. Before anyone could react, he'd grabbed Sophia by the shoulders and shoved her backward. ""What did Yvette ever do to deserve this?"" he screamed.

The impact sent Sophia stumbling backward. Her foot caught on someone's leg, and she fell hard—her head slamming into the concrete flower bed beside the pool.

Dizziness washed over her. The crowd's noise and Howard's angry face blurred together, fading away.

The last thing she saw was Yvette's sly, mocking smile before darkness swallowed her.

When Sophia came to, her head pounded. Strange, sad memories flooded her mind—cramming in like uninvited guests until everything went quiet.

Then she realized that she was trapped in some cheesy fantasy story where Yvette was the golden girl everyone loved.

Yvette had gone missing at two years old. After eighteen long years, the Chandlers got her back. From then on, she could do no wrong in their wealthy world.

Yvette's parents and three brothers spoiled her rotten. But it wasn't just her family—powerful businessmen, famous doctors, top scientists, and even super stars all adored her.

Yvette had a natural charm—sweet, kind, yet strong. Men fell under her spell instantly, tripping over themselves to please her. A single frown could send a roomful of powerful people into a panic.

Every tale needed its sacrificial side characters, and poor Sophia had drawn the shortest straw imaginable.

""Stop playing dead! Get up!"" Howard barked at Sophia's motionless form. Certain she was faking, he drew back his foot to deliver a sharp nudge.

Sophia suddenly opened her eyes, startling everyone. That venomous glare sent Howard reeling backward.

Calmly, Sophia got to her feet and dusted herself off. She looked around at her so-called family.

Her brothers' faces twisted with contempt. Nearby, Yvette and Heather sobbed dramatically in each other's arms.

A knowing smile curled Sophia's lips as the truth settled into place. ""Yvette,"" she purred, saccharine venom dripping from every syllable, ""did I really push you?""

Sophia's gentle voice and smile should have been warm, but instead made everyone's blood run cold.

Heather pulled Yvette closer as Sophia advanced, her protective grip tightening. ""That's enough, Sophia,"" she warned through clenched teeth. ""Don't humiliate yourself further. Go inside.""

""Stay out of it,"" Sophia snapped, her pleasant facade dropping instantly. ""I wasn't talking to you.""

The sudden shift left Heather speechless, the Chandler brothers equally stunned.

Sophia turned back to Yvette, forcing sweetness into her voice. ""Let's try this again. Did I push you?""

Yvette's eyes darted nervously before she buried herself in Heather's embrace, shaking like a leaf. ""Y-Yes... I mean no... I just slipped,"" she stammered through tears. ""It was an accident.""

The words barely left her mouth when Sophia seized Yvette by her hair, wrenching her from Heather's arms. Two sharp cracks rang out—open-handed strikes that left the garden dead silent.

# Chapter 2 Drag Everyone Down With Her

The slaps rang out sharper than Heather's earlier strike. Sophia's palms stung from the impact, but a twisted smile of satisfaction curled on her lips.

The resounding cracks shocked everyone into silence. The bustling area froze—no one could believe Sophia would strike Yvette in front of her own family and their elite guests.

Heather's hand flew to her mouth. ""How dare you!"" she shrieked, voice trembling with fury.

""Sophia!"" Howard, who was standing nearest to Sophia, charged at her like a bull. ""You'll pay for this!""

Sophia just smiled, grabbed Howard's wrist, and twisted hard. A well-placed kick sent him sprawling into the pool with an undignified splash.

When Sean Chandler and Elliot Chandler rushed to help, Sophia dispatched them just as easily—two more splashes, two more Chandler heirs floundering in the water. The refined garden party descended into bedlam.

""Have you lost your mind?"" Heather yelled at Sophia, no longer caring about keeping up appearances. The whole party watched as the Chandlers' perfect image collapsed.

Sophia watched the brothers thrash like waterlogged cats, her amusement growing with their frantic movements.

Then—white-hot pain exploded at the base of her skull. Her fingers came away stained crimson when she touched the wound. A few seconds later, a hollow laugh escaped her.

""Lost my mind?"" she muttered, voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Oh, Mother, I've never been clearer in my life.""

She knew exactly how this story would play out. No matter how hard she tried to avoid her fate or how many chances she got, death always won.

She was done pretending to be nice. Anger and rage were behind her now—she was ready to destroy this entire family along with herself.

But destroying this family wasn't enough. She'd take everyone's happiness down with hers.

Sophia turned to face the three elegantly dressed wealthy women behind her.

One of them had tripped Sophia, sending her crashing into the flower bed. Too bad for that woman—Sophia always repaid her debts.

The three wealthy women shuddered at Sophia's eerie smile—it looked unnatural, like something from a nightmare. Even in daylight, it sent chills down their spines.

""Wh-what do you want?"" they stammered, gripping each other's hands nervously.

Sophia's eyes dropped to their feet before locking onto one woman with a smirk. ""Mrs. Shelton, you were just pitying Yvette, weren't you?"" Her grin grew sharper. ""But honestly, you're the real pitiful one here.""

The woman named Vicky Shelton burst out laughing, and the others quickly joined in.

""Everyone knows Mr. Shelton adores his wife. He's the model husband—no affairs, no scandals.""

""While other men network at parties, he's always home by ten. That's why everyone knows Mr. Shelton as the most devoted husband.""

""Mrs. Shelton's been spoiled by him for twenty years. Her in-laws treat her like their own daughter, and her kids are perfect. Really, who on earth could be more fortunate than her?""

""To call Mrs. Shelton pitiful is laughable. Sophia's clearly not thinking straight.""

Sophia studied Vicky's smug, satisfied expression. ""Are those kids really yours?"" she challenged. ""And is Mr. Shelton completely faithful?""

Vicky's smile vanished, her face turning ghostly pale. That secret was supposed to be safe between her and her husband—those children weren't hers. Yet somehow, Sophia knew.

A surge of panic hit Vicky, but she quickly regained control. She glanced suspiciously at Heather, questioning whether she'd been set up.

Before Vicky could speak, Sophia cut in. ""Funny, Mr. Shelton isn't here today. Any idea where he might be?""

Vicky started to snap back, but Sophia's knowing smirk stopped her cold. Her breath caught for just a second before she forced out a light reply. ""Oh, my husband's away on business. He couldn't make it today.""

Vicky shifted gears, dropping her voice to a faux-concerned murmur. ""Sophia, I understand you're jealous of how much your family loves your sister. But after everything she's been through, can't you try to be kinder?""

Sophia nodded. ""Mrs. Shelton, I understand—you're not healthy and can't have children. But that doesn't give you the right to steal someone else's husband and family.""

Vicky's face twisted in shock. ""What the hell are you talking about?"" she snapped.

""Is she crazy? What's she saying?"" someone murmured.

""Did she snap after all that drama?"" another chimed in.

People were whispering, glancing around. They were all a little on edge, even if they didn't know why.

Yvette, her cheek still stinging from the slaps, watched Sophia with a mocking smile. 'Sophia's making a complete fool of herself in front of everyone,' she sneered inwardly.

Meanwhile, servants helped the three Chandler heirs out of the pool.

Sean, the eldest, turned to see Sophia still ranting. ""Sophia, have you lost your mind? Go home now,"" he ordered, water dripping from his clothes as his expression darkened.

Sophia paid no attention. As Elliot and Howard moved to grab her arms, the situation was quickly spiraling out of control.

Sophia's hand shot out, slapping both Elliot and Howard hard across their faces.

The sharp sound echoed, freezing everyone in place for a split second. Before they could recover, she kicked them straight back into the pool.

""Stay there and cool your heads,"" she said with icy sarcasm. ""You're not needed yet.""

The slap had stunned the brothers silent, but the cold water brought them back to their senses. ""Sophia..."" they choked out, their eyes now clear and furious.

Sophia loomed over the pool, eyes blazing as she pressed a silencing finger to her mouth.

The brothers immediately fell silent, recognizing the threat in her glare.

Then suddenly, Sophia's expression shifted to a chilling smile. She turned to Vicky, who stood frozen with clenched fists and a ghost-white face.

Leaning close, Sophia murmured an address into Vicky's ear, her voice just loud enough for Vicky to hear. ""Your husband isn't on a business trip. If you leave now, you might catch him with your children and their real mother.""

She added with a smirk, ""Today's that woman's birthday. They even took a happy family photo together—the perfect, cute little family.""

Vicky's head spun. ""Nonsense,"" she said, her voice trembling.

Sophia simply shrugged. ""Up to you whether you believe me.""

Vicky felt a pang of panic under Sophia's pitying gaze. 'He adores me, and our children love me. This can't be true,' she told herself. Yet her feet carried her toward the exit anyway.

As Vicky hurried away, the guests exchanged curious glances, completely baffled by what had just happened.

With Vicky gone, the two remaining society ladies grew visibly nervous under Sophia's gaze.

As they tried to slip away, Sophia caught one by the arm. ""Mrs. Lynn, why the sudden rush?""

Teresa Lynn stuttered, ""I—""

Sophia smiled sweetly. ""You praised Yvette as Halinston University's top student and this year's highest-scoring STEM graduate. Does that mean you already know about your son's cheating scandal?""

Teresa gasped, while the crowd murmured in confusion, ""Cheating scandal?""

# Chapter 3 Make The Guests Leave

The place buzzed with excited whispers as guests eagerly discussed the drama.

Teresa bristled under the crowd's judging stares. She whirled on Heather. ""Mrs. Chandler, some good host you are—inviting me just to have your daughter slander my son? I should sue your family for defamation.""

Heather tried to speak, flustered by the sudden turn of events. ""Mrs. Lynn, I—""

Sophia interrupted without looking up from her phone, knowing Heather would only make matters worse. ""Defamation?"" she asked with mock concern. ""Oh, wait, I did make one mistake earlier.""

For a moment, Teresa looked relieved, lifting her chin smugly.

Then Sophia's smile turned sharp. ""Your son didn't just cheat on his exams. Right now, he's holding a girl against her will and attempting to assault her.""

She held up her phone with a bright smile. ""Don't worry, I already called the police. Mrs. Lynn, you might not know how to raise your child properly, but the legal system certainly does. We can all trust in that, can't we?""

Teresa paled just like Vicky had. ""You Chandlers are unbelievable. This isn't over,"" she hissed. With that, she spun around and rushed off, nearly tripping in her heels as she scrambled to call someone.

With both Vicky and Teresa gone, only Sally remained. She took a step backward, her eyes wide with fear. ""What do you want from me? Don't come any closer!""

Sally had seen how Sophia had dealt with Vicky and Teresa. Now, trembling with fear, she tried to escape, but Sophia had her backed into a corner.

""Stay back, you crazy bitch!"" Sally screamed.

Sophia just smiled, completely unfazed. ""Mrs. Foley, you call me cold and heartless. But I'm still human."" Her voice turned icy. ""Your daughter? She's a monster.

""She became a bully before she even grew up—targeting smart kids from poor families just because she was jealous.

""She tore up a girl's homework, locked her in the restroom, threw garbage on her, and took pictures to humiliate her. And when that wasn't enough? She paid thugs to harass the girl... until she couldn't take it anymore and jumped.""

""Shut up!"" Sally shouted, her voice trembling as she tried to silence Sophia.

But Sophia refused to back down. ""What an amazing mother you are, Mrs. Foley, shelling out $60,000 to cover your daughter's crimes. That's the price of a human life to you?"" She let out a mocking laugh. ""I guess money really can buy anything.""

The crowd fell completely silent. Everyone stared in shock.

Rich families had skeletons in their closets—typically just affairs and messy relationships. But murder went far beyond ordinary scandal. No amount of money could excuse taking a life.

Sally turned deathly pale, looking ready to collapse.

""Sophia, please,"" Yvette pleaded, her voice soft but with a hint of feigned resignation. ""If you're mad, take it out on me. I'll deal with whatever comes. But you're making claims without proof. Do you realize what this could do to our family?""

A moment ago, Sally had been completely thrown off, but at Yvette's words, she suddenly lifted her head. ""Sophia, you're saying my daughter bullied someone and I paid to cover up a murder?"" she challenged. ""Show me the proof, or you'll regret it.""

Sophia glanced at Yvette and shrugged. ""Proof? I don't have any.""

Sally let out a relieved sigh, but her face turned red with anger. ""No proof, Sophia? Then you'd better be ready to face the consequences for falsely accusing me.""

Sophia nodded thoughtfully. ""Yeah, you're right. I don't have proof, but I'm calling the police. I trust the system. They'll get to the truth and make sure justice is done.""

Sally's eyes widened in panic. She looked around at the other Chandlers and snapped, ""Fine. Do whatever you want. The Chandler family, huh? We'll see what happens next.""

Sophia smiled and waved. ""Can't wait, Mrs. Foley.""

Humiliated, Sally turned and fled.

Sophia's gaze swept over the guests. The originally cheerful chatter died out as people quickly made their excuses and left. Just like that, the party came to an abrupt end—all because of Sophia.

Heather's face was pale with anger. ""Sophia, you ruined this party. Are you happy now?"" she snapped.

Sophia shot her a cold look. ""Thrilled,"" she said sarcastically.

Heather's face flushed red, and she looked like she was about to lose it.

\*\*\*\*\*

Just then, Jonathan Chandler, their dad, emerged from the coffee room, where he'd been wrapped up in business talk.

His sharp eyes swept over his disheveled children, lingering on Sophia. ""Go to the memorial hall and think about what you've done,"" he ordered.

As the head of the Chandler family, Jonathan wasn't a man to be crossed—even the air seemed to still when he was furious.

Sophia didn't react at all. She just grabbed a plate and started loading it up with food. She'd been hiding near the pool the whole time to avoid Yvette, so she hadn't eaten anything yet. Her stomach now growled loudly.

""Hey, Sophia! Are you even listening to me?"" Jonathan's voice grew louder as he clenched his teeth, his frustration mounting.

Sophia barely glanced up from her plate. ""I'm hungry. At least let me eat first.""

Feeling the pain from her injury, she then called to a servant, ""Get the family doctor. I'm not feeling well.""

The servant had barely responded when Jonathan growled, ""Call that doctor and see what happens.""

The servant immediately backed down, knowing better than to argue.

Sophia just rolled her eyes and kept eating, completely focused on her food.

She took her time chewing, savoring each bite while stealing glances at Jonathan's furious expression. She had to admit—seeing him so worked up gave her a quiet sense of satisfaction. The place fell completely still, thick with tension.

A few minutes later, Yvette came downstairs in fresh clothes, while Sophia kept eating, ignoring everyone. ""Dad, don't be mad,"" Yvette said softly. ""Sophia didn't mean any harm. If you're going to blame anyone, blame me.""

Yvette had changed into a simple white dress, her long silky hair falling straight around her delicate face.

She had a fragile, gentle look—slender waist, expressive eyes—the kind of girl who made people want to protect her.

When Jonathan saw his eldest daughter—who had been missing for eighteen years and was finally found—his anger melted away in an instant. His face softened, and he looked heartbroken and guilty.

He gently touched Yvette's swollen, red cheek and said softly, ""Yvette, I know you're a good girl. You don't need to beg for her. I need to explain what happened today to the three families.""

For a second, Yvette's eyes gleamed with satisfaction at Sophia's trouble, but she quickly forced a worried look. ""But Sophia—""

Sophia pushed her plate away and let out a loud, deliberate burp before wiping her mouth. ""Ugh, enough already,"" she groaned, rolling her eyes. ""It's just the stupid memorial hall. I'll go. Stop with the fake sympathy. It's making me sick.""

# Chapter 4 Burn The Memorial Hall Down

In the Chandler family's memorial hall, Sophia sat cross-legged on a cushion against the wall, flipping through photos of long-gone ancestors.

She grinned and scratched her chin. ""You guys got lucky dying early,"" she muttered. ""If you saw what Jonathan and the rest of the family are up to now, you'd probably be rolling in your graves.""

She looked around the room, talking to the empty space. ""I've been here a bunch of times, but you've never once shown up. Kinda rude, don't you think?""

She shook her head after a moment. ""Nah, forget it. I'm not wasting my breath arguing with ghosts. I'll take it up with your deadbeat descendants.

""I won't let you down. I'm gonna shake things up around here. Big time.

""And it's not just the Chandlers. I'm going after Yvette's pursuers too. I've been through hell and back, and now it's their turn. I'm gonna tear their families apart and leave them in the dust.""

Without waiting for any response from the empty hall, Sophia muttered to herself, looking oddly pleased, ""Just killing them once? Maybe I'm being too nice. Don't you think?""

The Shelton, Lynn, and Foley families would all become Yvette's supporters in the future.

This new chance had given Sophia the perfect opportunity for revenge. Her first priority was to destroy several key figures and ensure some of them ended up behind bars—an excellent beginning to her plans.

Sophia took a moment to process everything, then yawned and stood up. She tossed the photos onto the table and said seriously, ""Chandler ancestors, I've thought it over. You don't deserve my forgiveness.""

She went to the kitchen, grabbed some cooking oil and a lighter, then returned to the memorial hall and set the ancestor photos on fire.

The flames cast an eerie glow on her pale, blank face as she stood before the burning photos. ""You're the reason that bastard Jonathan exists,"" she said under her breath.

Watching the fire consume the photos, she said coldly, ""Useless scraps. If you really had any power in the afterlife, you'd still side with Jonathan."" Done with the memorial hall, she retreated to her room to wash up and sleep.",1,1748253744.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1kvqn62,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1kvqn62/suicidal_thoughts_are_back_after_so_much_hard/,suicidal thoughts are back after so much hard work in therapy. im so mentally fatigued. am i crazy for not loving my mom?,"hi everyone, honestly just need some advice on how to deal with this.

tldr; my mum is a narcissit parent. im so exhausted. I've been exhausted since a child and im now in my 20s. while other kids are thriving, i felt like all my energy was used surviving. there's always something to fight about everyday. always something that doesn't go her way, and the worst part - she starts making up these ""projected worst case scenarios"", gets angry at the completely fictional scenario she created and takes it out on me. let me give you an example:

my dad is about to go far away for a job interview to work for a family friend. i already told her yes, i will absolutely cancel anything that's going on so i can follow and support. she crashed out this morning and said that ""later you will say you want to go out with your friend and you cant follow, fine! blablabla"" then i literally said that i will clear my schedule to go...

I've always felt like im walking on eggshells around her since a child - never knowing what would tick her bomb. i felt like i lost my childhood and teenagehood carefree-ness and happiness, and could never reach my full potential because of all the issues sucking my energy. im in university now and went through intensive therapy to be somewhat stable. but after 1.5y of effort, i had my first suicial thought and slapped myself multiple times. im scared. the last time i did this was before therapy. there's no outlet at home. i have no siblings to seek comfort in, im always being threatened everyday and words are being put in my mouth. im upset, im angry.

sometimes i think to myself, maybe the universe made it hard for my mum to conceive (she only got me after 7 years though IVF) because it knew she wasn't ready to be a mom. the universe gave her the strongest soul (me) and its a miracle im still alive after all the mental and physical abuse, though more on the mental side.

when i was young, she put divorce papers in front of me and said if i dont get top of the class, i will be responsible for the divorce and she had alr signed it. i was 9 or 10 at that time. she said a lot of hurtful things to me that i am tired to type but essentially her punishments never met the scale of the ""mistake"" made.

to put into perspective, i had gone downstairs to buy ice cream with a friend i brought over. my mum asked me to buy a bottle of evian water for her too but like i forgot (i was 11/12). when i came up she was FURIOUS and by the way the shop is just under my apartment. i said i can just go back down and she threw a whole TANTRUM saying i dont love her and that i dont care about her and the worst part is - because i was brought up this way (and psyched by her that no one cares about me except her), it shaped the way i viewed the world. like her thinking basically micro-analyses every single little thing people around her do and someone is able to make small things indicators that they hate her even though it was genuine forgetfulness. i thought everyone was like her. i was so wrong and i have a strong support system outside of my household but she seems to be jealous of it now.

im so scared because not only have the suicial thoughts come back, but my brain constantly feels fatigue even with sufficient sleep. even coffee doesn't help to keep me awake - its like my body just wants to rest constantly and i need to do my projects. the only thing that keeps me going is my side art hustle but that's also an issue cause she hates mess and artists are well- the creative process is barely ever ""neat"". but i keep the ""creative mess"" to my room. there's no paint stains, im literally woking on jewellery.

im so worried cause im already alone in this household, my dad is lowkey a victim too so he's gone nonverbal for years and I've only understood now that that's the only way to deal with a narcissit. but its so unfair- why do they always have to win even when they're in the wrong? when i was helping my mum cook in the kitchen for the first time, she handed me the knife and veggies and told me to cut. obviously i was like i dont know how to this is my first time, you're supposed to teach me and she told me 'USE YOUR COMMON SENSE"" and chased me out of the kitchen. imagine the developmental impact of this on my academic journey - i struggled to ask for help from my teachers because i thought i was just stupid (dont worry im in a top 10 uni, ended up fine after i made the hard decision to retake a year). i didn't know it was okay to ask for help and that people wouldn't tell me its common sense. call me petty but now whenever she asks for help i basically treat her the same way she treated me growing up and she gets SO UPSET to the extent she goes to her friends house to ask her friends daughter to help with whatever i said i couldn't. which brings me to my next point. because she is a mother, i dont know if religion has influenced her to believe that being a mother means deserving unconditional service. she basically expects me to stop EVERYTHING im doing to do what shes asking me to do right now. like... she doesn't care if im in a zoom meeting, doing homework, studying, stressed, i have to DROP EVERYTHING and attend to her. even when I've made plans WEEKS in advance with friends which i informed her about, she will (i dont know if its on purpose), expect me to cancel and go out with her instead. seems like shes trying to restore her authority or maybe has jealousy issues.

oh my god i remember she even made a tiktok account using my videos that she screenrecorded frm my IG stories or those she took of me. then she posted them to a public account that i was blcioked from and ""role-played"" as me. WHY IS MY MOTHER IMPERSONATING ME ?!!! isn't this some kind of mental health issue what the fuck please ... i only knew about this cause it came out on my friend's FYP.

oh and when i got late-diagnosed for ADHD in university, she pointed at me and said i was a manipulator LOL. not to mention she even lied to my psychiatrist back then when i got diagnosed with anxiety (honestly i swear its because of her). and i had to correct her in front of my psychiatrist cause what she was saying made it seem like i was lying. so i basically debated with her in front of the psych. thankfully he could pick up bullshit.

anyways it seems like i can never win, but for my mental state, not fighting for my rights when I've been wronged seems to do worse than engaging with a narcissit parent. like, is my life gonna be like this forever? love is meant to be earned, not demanded right? i feel bad for not loving my mum but how can i? shes not stingy at all with money btw just to be clear - she just has issues... and the last issue i will share is that she things spending more money = love. like I've repeatedly tried to tell her you cant buy love from people which is why she keeps ending up befriending shitty people that keep using her.",1,1748253638.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

Got a masters in accounting for extra recruiting time even though I didn’t need to for CPA and still nobody cared to give me an interview after 400+ apps at the time. 

So I started at big 4 in audit, did two years then applied again, still nobody cared so I went to industry out of frustration and been in this job for 6 months during which I’ve been silently applying continuously with no traction. At this point I’m too demotivated and don’t care anymore. I tried switching to FPA at my current company. Had coffee chats with half the FPA team in the last 6 months, went in 5 days a week, still nobody cared so I legit stopped giving a fuck.

Ive been working from home as much as I can the last month and on days I’m WFH I literally do zero work. My mouse is on a mouse jiggler and I’m just going about my day. When I do go in the office, I’ve been taking long lunches and just working slow cus I frankly don’t care about my current role and absolutely hate it. 

The obvious thing would be to change jobs but yet another accounting job would be the same thing as I have now and I haven’t been getting any traction in FPA/FDD jobs since undergrad. I’m too frustrated and demotivated to go back to giving a shit. Ideally I would want a fully remote job now so I can go live somewhere cheaper and instead focus on some hobbies I’ve said aside for the last few years.

Anyone else here just demotivated from this job market?",2,1748253451.0,Accounting,1,0.75,False

**Chapter 1**



Council's Academy: Hidden Royal



\*\*\*



Alpha Talon's P.O.V.*（Talon is Taliyah's father.）*



I am sitting in my office, when a videocall comes in. Surprised at the ID on my screen, I wonder if I should answer it.



As soon as I answer the call, I can see that he is furious and I want to know what the cause of his rage is. I contemplate on how to phrase my question, but it is not necessary because he starts ranting as soon as he sees that I have answered his call.



“What is wrong with women? How difficult is it to put a pup in to this world?” I immediately know that his latest Mate failed to give him a living pup.



“Did she survive or do you need to find another Mate?” I ask even though I have a feeling I already know the answer.



“She survived giving birth, but she didn’t survive me.” He screams and I hear something crashing against the wall. “When she told me that my Son had not survived, I grab her by the throat and squeezed the life out of her.”



I let him scream and yell as I try to figure out what to say. The man on the other side of the call is as cruel as I am. We both take what we want, in any way that we want it.



The difference is that he has a bigger problem controlling his anger then I do. His fated Mate died in childbirth together with his Son, after that he took a chosen Mate and for a while I thought he had found something with her.



But when their Son was born dead, he had ripped her apart. His Beta’s Mate had tried to comfort him, but there was only one thing his Wolf thought could help him and he had forced himself on to her.



His Beta had taken his Mate and they had left his Pack, none of us know where they went. For a few days I thought he might have gone to the Palace, but no one ever showed up to hold Roger accountable for his actions.



The women in his Pack fear him and for good reason, because he has forced himself on almost every female in his Pack. The males don’t do anything against it, because in his Pack every male has a chosen Mate and for that reason they don’t really feel pain when their Mate is with someone else.



I have taken liberties with some of them as well, while I was visiting his Pack. We both enjoyed watching the other take an unwilling woman and I groan as I remember the last time I went to see him.



If I remember correctly this was chosen Mate number four and I doubt it will take him long to get himself another Mate.



“Do you need me to come over?” I ask and my thing hardens as I think of what I want to do. His head snaps in my direction and a smile creeps on to his face. “Get here as fast as you can, alone.” He states and disconnects the call.



I adjust myself and link my Mate to get to my office.



There is a knock on the door and before I can answer my Mate walks in, as she looks at me she can see the bulge in my pants. Her hips are swaying as she makes her way over to my desk.



I just sit back as she gets on her knees... ...

She knows exactly what I want now. She knows how to please both me and my wolf.



**Chapter 2**





Taliyah’s P.O.V.



My name is Taliyah, Alpha Talon's daughter, and I am twenty-five years old.



The world as you know it, no longer exists. In this time and age Humans are a myth. Most of the Human civilization was destroyed during the war, torn down or has crumbled to pieces over the centuries.



Only the high-ways still exist, smaller roads are nothing more than dirt roads. Cities and villages are mostly gone, taken over by nature.



Not that we care, because nature is our friend. We love running through the forests around us.



None of us knows what the world looked like back then, there are only stories, files and pictures left in the Council’s Archives.



Let me tell you how that happened.



Centuries ago, the Humans discovered the existence of Werewolves and Lycans. We were outed by a reporter, someone who didn’t care about anything but herself.



A Werewolf Alpha found out she was his Mate. Because every Lycan and Werewolf knows the significance of a Mate, we know that every Lycan or Werewolf would have done the same. He told her the truth about who and what he was, hoping that she would accept him. His explanation, his turning in to a Werewolf to show her the truth, it was all recorded.



She asked him for time to process it all, realizing it was a lot to deal with he gave her time and she broadcasted it within an hour after he left.



As soon as the news reached him on what she had done, he went to her workplace to confront her and that is when it all went to hello. Security guards and cops that recognized him, tried to capture him and that is when Humankind found out that we were living among them.



Some of the guards and cops were Werewolves and Lycans and they came to the aid of the Alpha. He was able to get away and he took his Mate with him.



The Archives tell us that he delivered her to the Council, he rejected her and left her behind after he told them to do with her as they pleased. They questioned her and once it was clear that she did it to gain fame, they sentenced her to death.



The rejection, her trail, her conviction and sentencing were broadcasted in real-time and it started an all-out war with the Humans.



No one blamed the Alpha for what he did, after all every Werewolf and Lycan wants to find his or her Mate. Our Mate completes us; they give us comfort, they give us strength. The Mate-bond is a strong and powerful thing, so most kept looking for their Mate, we still do.



Some Humans accepted the fact that they were Mated to a Werewolf or Lycan and some didn’t accept it and committed suicide even though the Council informed the Humans through a broadcast that rejecting a Lycan or Werewolf would suffice.



And in some cases parents or siblings killed their entire family after they found out one of their children or siblings were mated to a Werewolf or Lycan.



After decades most Humans were gone and those that still lived among us, chose not to have children. With no more Humans being born, they went extinct and the Humans that were mated to a Werewolf or Lycan would not give birth to a Human. After all their genes were not as dominant as ours.



And now, centuries later, the only reason we are still taught about Humans, has to do with the fact that sometimes a Pup turns out to be Wolfless. As soon as we become of age, we shift for the first time.



Werewolves become of age on their eighteenth birthday and Lycans on their twenty-first birthday.



If a Pup does not shift, they are called wolfless, they can’t shift and they don’t have the speed or the strength of our kind.



And I am one of them, I am wolfless or at least that is what I let everyone believe.



My Father is Alpha Talon, Alpha of the Blue Crystal Pack. My Father is cruel, a sexist and he takes whatever he wants from whoever he wants.



My Father either ignores me or he treats me like a servant. He refuses to call me by the name my Mother gave to me. He always calls me Tali, because he doesn’t consider me a gift.



My name Taliyah means Gift and my Mother told me that she gave me that name because I was a gift from the Goddess.



The only one that actually calls me Taliyah is my Brother, Xandros and he is also the only one that treats me normal. At least when my family is not around and even though I dislike it, I know he does it to keep me safe.



The day my Mother died, my Father marked Alena as his Chosen Mate and she is no better than my Father. She always calls for me when something has to be done.



I also think she hates me because I refused to call her Mother or Mom after my Father marked her. Ayden, my oldest Brother, calls her Mother, but like me Xandros refuses.



I know that she blames me for that, after all I told her, in front of a lot of Pack-members, that I would never call her Mother even if my life would depend on it.



I am still hoping that one day soon I will find my Mate and if the Goddess is on my side, he will be from another Pack. So I can finally leave this shithole behind.



I smile at the thought of walking out of the Pack-house and I can already hear Alena cussing and swearing, because it will mean she has to find someone else to bug.



My Uncle, who is also the Pack’s Gamma, and his Mate show me time and time again what it is like to have your Fated Mate by you side. They remind me of the stories my Mother used to tell me as a bedtime story.



Growing up, my Mother would tell me stories of my Grandparents. They met at a masquerade Ball, hosted at the Palace. My Grandmother wore a beautiful, deep red ballgown and my Grandfather wore a dark three-pieced suite.



They felt the pull towards each other, the second they were both in the ball-room. The room fell quiet as my Grandfather made his way over to his Mate, my Grandmother was in shock to find her Mate so soon after becoming of age.



My Mother told me about her childhood, growing up with an older Brother and both her parents around. That even after many years of being together, they would not let the opportunity pass by to touch one and other.



To cuddle and hold the other in their arms. To steal a kiss when they thought no one was looking.



My Mother was always smiling as she told me those stories at bedtime.





**Chapter 3**





Alena’s P.O.V.



As I walk out of the office, I see Tali walking in to the kitchen. She is my Mate’s Daughter and her birth ruined everything for my Mate. I wish there was a way to get rid of her.



“Luna Alena, will Alpha Talon be home for dinner?” an Omega asks as I am still looking at the entrance of the kitchen. She shakes me from my thoughts and I growl at her.



“No, he is away on business for a few days.” I say and I make my way upstairs to our room. I need to clean myself up after what he did to me.



I know that Talon cares for no one but himself, but being his Mate gives me status. A status I would never have gotten waiting for my fated Mate. My parents proved it to me in the end, because when my Father died my Mother lost her mind and little by little she withered away.



She was killed by rogues when she wandered out of the house one night, the Pack-doctor said that she had no defensive wounds and there for he concluded that she did not put up a fight.



I swore I would never find myself in her situation and by accepting Talon as my Mate I severed the bond to my unknown Mate. As far as our kind knows the Goddess would have given him a new Mate and he would never know that I was technically his first Mate.



The hot water streaming down my back eases the pain Talon caused me, even though he made me come harder than ever before.



I close my eyes and my hand glides between my legs, I remember the feeling as he ... Tears run down my cheeks.



I knew it, the moment his Wolf took over. He and his Wolf are both borderline sadistic and hearing him tell me to scream, I knew he got turned on by my pain.



What I had not expected was to feel pleasure as Talon...





Alpha Roger’s P.O.V.



After ending the call with Talon I feel a little bit better, but I know that my Wolf has not settled down yet.



I let the females in my Pack run through my mind, I need to find the perfect woman for me and Talon. A knock on the door startles me out of my thoughts and I am about to get pissed, until I sense who is on the other side.



I tell him to enter and in walks my best Delta. He took a chosen Mate recently, but he told me she is acting out.



“How is your Mate doing?” I ask him and the murderous look in his eyes tells me enough. “Talon is on his way, send her here as soon as he arrives.” A smirk crosses his face and he nods his head.



I ask him if there was a reason for his visit and he tells me I already helped him out with it.



Half an hour later Talon is sitting on the couch as a soft knock on the door is heard. “Come in.” I say as I smile at Talon, he has no idea of the treat waiting on the other side of the door.



“You wanted to see me, Alpha Roger?” She asks, while she looks at the floor. “Why don’t you close the door and take a seat.” I gesture at the chair on the other side of my desk.



As she sits down, Talon gets up and I know the same thing runs through his mind.



“Your Mate tells me you have some trouble adjusting to your mated life.” I say quietly and her head snaps up. I can tell she had not seen that one coming. Talon takes the seat next to her and asks her what the problem is.



Her eyes return to the floor as she whispers “He wants to do things I don’t want.” Talon asks if she can tell him what those things might be. The way he is talking I would almost think he actually cares, but I think I know why he is acting this way.



She softly tells him that her Mate wants to share her with his brother, that he wants them to take her at the same time.



My thing hardens thinking about that sight and I know that before the night is over she will know that it would have been easier if she had given in. Talon puts his hand on her knee and asks her why she refused it.



She slowly looks up at him and tells him that she is a wirgen, that she can’t imagine having two men at the same time.



She tries to move away from Talon as his hand is sliding up her leg and I move to the door and lock it, using my Werewolf speed. It startles her as soon as she hears the click of the lock.



“Sweetheart, you are going to find out, it might have been better if you had given in to your Mate. Because now you will learn that we don’t care what you want, we only care about what we want.” Talon says as he shoves his hand between her legs.





**Chapter 4**



Alpha Talon’s P.O.V.



She fights me, but she is no match for an Alpha. Especially not an Alpha like me or Roger.



Roger grabs her hair and pulls her head back, making her scream. I chuckle, because we both like it when they scream. I began to touch her and I am not gentle.



“You will take everything we give you. Scream all you want, no one will help you.” I whispers in her ear.



I let my claw come out and I start to rip the clothes from her, Roger is enjoying himself, seeing more and more of her delectable body. 



“Maybe we should invite your Mate and his Brother to come watch us as we show you what we want to do.”



As I hear a knock on the door, Roger opens it for his Delta and his brother and locks it behind them.



They turn the seats in front of his desk around and take a seat. I have already moved her from her seat and I have shoved the coffee table aside.



She is crying and whimpering, but it doesn’t stop me or Roger from what we want. ",1,1748253341.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1kvqjsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DysfunctionalFamily/comments/1kvqjsl/mental_fatigue_advice_please_im_so_so_exhausted/,"mental fatigue - advice please, im so so exhausted","hi everyone, honestly just need some advice on how to deal with a narcissistic parent

tldr; my mum is a narcissit parent. im so exhausted. I've been exhausted since a child and im now in my 20s. while other kids are thriving, i felt like all my energy was used surviving. there's always something to fight about everyday. always something that doesn't go her way, and the worst part - she starts making up these ""projected worst case scenarios"", gets angry at the completely fictional scenario she created and takes it out on me. let me give you an example:

my dad is about to go far away for a job interview to work for a family friend. i already told her yes, i will absolutely cancel anything that's going on so i can follow and support. she crashed out this morning and said that ""later you will say you want to go out with your friend and you cant follow, fine! blablabla"" then i literally said that i will clear my schedule to go...

I've always felt like im walking on eggshells around her since a child - never knowing what would tick her bomb. i felt like i lost my childhood and teenagehood carefree-ness and happiness, and could never reach my full potential because of all the issues sucking my energy. im in university now and went through intensive therapy to be somewhat stable. but after 1.5y of effort, i had my first suicial thought and slapped myself multiple times. im scared. the last time i did this was before therapy. there's no outlet at home. i have no siblings to seek comfort in, im always being threatened everyday and words are being put in my mouth. im upset, im angry.

sometimes i think to myself, maybe the universe made it hard for my mum to conceive (she only got me after 7 years though IVF) because it knew she wasn't ready to be a mom. the universe gave her the strongest soul (me) and its a miracle im still alive after all the mental and physical abuse, though more on the mental side.

when i was young, she put divorce papers in front of me and said if i dont get top of the class, i will be responsible for the divorce and she had alr signed it. i was 9 or 10 at that time. she said a lot of hurtful things to me that i am tired to type but essentially her punishments never met the scale of the ""mistake"" made.

to put into perspective, i had gone downstairs to buy ice cream with a friend i brought over. my mum asked me to buy a bottle of evian water for her too but like i forgot (i was 11/12). when i came up she was FURIOUS and by the way the shop is just under my apartment. i said i can just go back down and she threw a whole TANTRUM saying i dont love her and that i dont care about her and the worst part is - because i was brought up this way (and psyched by her that no one cares about me except her), it shaped the way i viewed the world. like her thinking basically micro-analyses every single little thing people around her do and someone is able to make small things indicators that they hate her even though it was genuine forgetfulness. i thought everyone was like her. i was so wrong and i have a strong support system outside of my household but she seems to be jealous of it now.

im so scared because not only have the suicial thoughts come back, but my brain constantly feels fatigue even with sufficient sleep. even coffee doesn't help to keep me awake - its like my body just wants to rest constantly and i need to do my projects. the only thing that keeps me going is my side art hustle but that's also an issue cause she hates mess and artists are well- the creative process is barely ever ""neat"". but i keep the ""creative mess"" to my room. there's no paint stains, im literally woking on jewellery.

  
im so worried cause im already alone in this household, my dad is lowkey a victim too so he's gone nonverbal for years and I've only understood now that that's the only way to deal with a narcissit. but its so unfair- why do they always have to win even when they're in the wrong? when i was helping my mum cook in the kitchen for the first time, she handed me the knife and veggies and told me to cut. obviously i was like i dont know how to this is my first time, you're supposed to teach me and she told me 'USE YOUR COMMON SENSE"" and chased me out of the kitchen. imagine the developmental impact of this on my academic journey - i struggled to ask for help from my teachers because i thought i was just stupid (dont worry im in a top 10 uni, ended up fine after i made the hard decision to retake a year). i didn't know it was okay to ask for help and that people wouldn't tell me its common sense. call me petty but now whenever she asks for help i basically treat her the same way she treated me growing up and she gets SO UPSET to the extent she goes to her friends house to ask her friends daughter to help with whatever i said i couldn't. which brings me to my next point. because she is a mother, i dont know if religion has influenced her to believe that being a mother means deserving unconditional service. she basically expects me to stop EVERYTHING im doing to do what shes asking me to do right now. like... she doesn't care if im in a zoom meeting, doing homework, studying, stressed, i have to DROP EVERYTHING and attend to her. even when I've made plans WEEKS in advance with friends which i informed her about, she will (i dont know if its on purpose), expect me to cancel and go out with her instead. seems like shes trying to restore her authority or maybe has jealousy issues.

oh my god i remember she even made a tiktok account using my videos that she screenrecorded frm my IG stories or those she took of me. then she posted them to a public account that i was blcioked from and ""role-played"" as me. WHY IS MY MOTHER IMPERSONATING ME ?!!! isn't this some kind of mental health issue what the fuck please ... i only knew about this cause it came out on my friend's FYP.

  
oh and when i got late-diagnosed for ADHD in university, she pointed at me and said i was a manipulator LOL. not to mention she even lied to my psychiatrist back then when i got diagnosed with anxiety (honestly i swear its because of her). and i had to correct her in front of my psychiatrist cause what she was saying made it seem like i was lying. so i basically debated with her in front of the psych. thankfully he could pick up bullshit.

anyways it seems like i can never win, but for my mental state, not fighting for my rights when I've been wronged seems to do worse than engaging with a narcissit parent. like, is my life gonna be like this forever? love is meant to be earned, not demanded right? i feel bad for not loving my mum but how can i? shes not stingy at all with money btw just to be clear - she just has issues... and the last issue i will share is that she things spending more money = love. like I've repeatedly tried to tell her you cant buy love from people which is why she keeps ending up befriending shitty people that keep using her.

watch my video to understand how im not able to defend myself. im always interrupted. im not ALLOWED to defend myself. at all and forever. im sorry the video is bilingual but essentially she was mad over a few things, mainly about her being in pain (she has a slip disc) and has a heart issue. she was upset that the doctor i brought her to said she would like to refer my mum to the psych bc my mum said she always cant sleep at night because of 1) thoughts, then followed by 2) chest pain. and the doc said it makes sense cause emotions are linked to the heart and she had an irregular ecg reading. anyways we already had a referral to go to emergency but she REFUSED to go and now complains everyday which is why i said ""if you dont want to take care of yourself, how am i supposed to take care of you"". im so sick and tired of her being the thermostat of the house - if shes happy, everyone must be happy. if shes upset- everyone must be upset. im really on my last straw please someone, anyone if you've gone through something similar, i just need some words of advice on how to mentally cope with this situation for the rest of my life.

P.S. because of my mum's tendency to fabricate and lie, it is for my one self protection that i have a google drive with evidence for therapy and psych.",1,1748253250.0,DysfunctionalFamily,0,1.0,False

This would have been around 2013/2014. It was a town/neighborhood role play game. You spawned in front of a Target, and I believe there was a car wash next to it, and a music stage in front of it. Across the street, there were clothing stores where you could put on the clothes mannequins were wearing (I think they were originally just out in the open, but eventually got their own stores, a girl and a boy one). I think there was also a coffee shop and a burger place near the spawn, but I can’t remember exactly as I keep getting memories mixed up with other games lol. I don’t remember much else about it. I know it was popular around the same time as Welcome to the Town of Robloxia, and it was very very similar.

They live a city away that’s at least a 6 hour drive so thankfully they can’t just come up here. They don’t have my new address either. My Nmother had my enabler father put my relative up to asking me to come to the baptism and she was honest when I asked her so I explained why we don’t talk because I’m sure this relative has been fed all sorts by the family. 

This relative has always known me to be quiet and at times scarily obedient as a kid and thinks I probably rebelled too late if anything. She respects I might not want to see the family but she still would like me to be at the baptism. I’ve explained about the surgery (I don’t know the exact date but ngl I was told it was probably going to happen the same week). Even if not I might end up just saying so to avoid the grief.


So I’ve already told the relative I’d decline but am happy to meet with her separately. __One of my siblings reached out with this message after I expressed I’d not go:__

*“So /u/inquiteapredicament, and say this with hand in your heart with full honesty, because I feel this is the least you can give me. You can’t free up one day a year to see us? Like I’m coming to terms with the fact that you have fully cut off attachment to us but the process of essentially losing another sibling is not easy for me. (Context: we lost a brother to cancer). Like any time that works for You I’m not even saying when it works for us I’m saying whenever YOU have the time. I’m not going to say anything about your spouse cos as much as id love to meet my sibling in law i really don’t know how the situation is like on if u would even want them to meet any of us. I’m not trying to make you feel uncomfortable but.. GENUINELY WISH I DIDN’T CARE THIS MUCH. I’m crashing out! I just want to have a real conversation with you /u/inquiteapredicament . Without any excuses. What feelings are you still harbouring? Raw feelings please? I’m here to listen. I just want a real conversation. I hope you can respond at some point”*

__She added a day or so later when I didn’t respond with:__
*“Hellooooo”*
*“could I hypothetically go to somewhere and give u a gift, was meant to be a Christmas thing but ho hum this is the way life goes“*
*“A corner shop, a coffee shop, lurgitttt anywhere”*
*“Please stop ignoring meeee”*

__I responded with the below:__
*Sorry it’s taken me a while to respond—I needed time to sit with everything and make sure I could reply honestly.*

*Look, I get that this is hard for you, and I’m really not trying to hurt anyone. The space I’ve needed isn’t something I decided on a whim—it’s what I’ve had to do to stay okay after everything that happened.*

*I do care about you. And I want you to know that I don’t see us as disconnected. We’ve still been talking over the phone and keeping in touch in our own way. Just because there hasn’t been face-to-face contact doesn’t mean there’s no connection. I have my own life, just like you do, and I’m doing the best I can to balance everything right now.*

*When you say things like you’re “crashing out” or that I’ve “fully cut off attachment,” it places the weight of your emotional state on me—and that’s the kind of pressure I’m trying to move away from. Not because I don’t care, but because I need to take care of my mental wellbeing too.*

*I’d genuinely like to find a way we can be in each other’s lives that doesn’t leave me feeling emotionally overwhelmed. But asking for “raw feelings” or calling my real-life circumstances “excuses” just makes it harder for me to stay open.*

*And just to be clear—my surgery isn’t an excuse. It’s something I genuinely have going on, along with work and everything else. When I said I’m open to meeting, I meant it—but it has to be on my terms, when I feel ready, not when I feel pushed. If you don’t feel ready at that point, I’ll respect that too. I just hope the same respect can be extended my way.*

*Also, I want to be honest that I’m not comfortable speaking on the phone this week. It’s not that I don’t trust myself to stay calm, I do. But I don’t feel confident that a conversation right now would actually be helpful or supportive, given how tense things have been. I need to protect my peace a little longer before I can consider that kind of interaction.*

*I appreciate you wanting to give a Christmas present in person, but I’m not in a place right now where I feel comfortable meeting up. It really means more to me to connect when it feels mutual and safe, not tied to a sense of obligation. I’m also trying to keep things as light and simple as possible right now with everything going on.*

*Lastly, I want to acknowledge something you said before (during one of our past conversations), that my being at the family home for those 3 months back in 2022 created so much animosity that people needed therapy. That really stayed with me. I’ve been carrying the weight of that, and part of the space I’ve taken has been to process things like that too.*

*I hope you can respect where I’m at right now, even if it doesn’t fully make sense from your side.*

__This was her response to that:__
*“ Hey /u/inquiteapredicament , you’re right in saying this is hard, how could it not be? I know we keep in touch over the phone, but I didn’t ever think I would be having an internet relationship with my own sister. We do have our own lives, but I really think that face-to-face connection is vital to keeping a relationship healthy.*

*I apologise for saying I was crashing out, I was just in a moment of high emotion and in no way was I intending to pressure you. When I say raw feelings, I just want you to be completely honest with me, and to be honest, I feel like you hold back most of the time.*

*When I say excuses, it’s simply because any single time we try to organise something, there is ALWAYS a problem without fail, so when this has happened for three years, I am going to assume that there has been an excuse or two said along the way. I will be clear with you too, I never mentioned your nose surgery to be an excuse, and I am very much aware that you have been having problems with breathing as I did. I just found it strange how we were having very similar procedures done but yours required a 48-hour stay etc., that was all I pointed out.*

*I don’t believe I recall you saying you were ready to meet at any point, as you clearly said you are not ready to meet at every possible chance that it has been brought up. I believe uncomfortable conversations need to be had sometimes, you can’t always avoid it and I completely understand protecting your peace, but I love you and your family loves you and that’s why these things happen.*

*I’m not too sure of your use of the word “safe” here in regards to meeting up? That honestly seems quite ill-intended as what have I done to you to make you feel unsafe? Finally, I will address this whole “animosity” situation. I believe maybe something got lost in translation or this has been taken out of context. The only people to seek therapy after you left the house were me and other sister. I tried to go into therapy (which lasted for about a month) for a variety of reasons, not just that specific situation surrounding you. Orher sister went into therapy for the same reason, and also for self-improvement.*

*I feel slightly disappointed with this message if I’m being honest, as I tried to raise two significant issues with you. The first was the fact that I feel like I’m losing you as a sibling, and that is really hard for not just me but all of us. We all love and miss you so much. The second being is there is not one day in a year that you could say a date that works for you to meet up. Both of these I repeated multiple times and it’s upsetting that they didn’t even get acknowledged.*

*Anyways, I hope we can go back to texting here and there. Hope you are taking care of yourself, /u/inquiteapredicament . Stay safe!”*

Was I TA? Was my initial response bad in any way? As far as I’m aware my sister went from scapegoat to flying monkey. The other sister remains a GC the one who orchestrated me becoming homeless. This sister has GAD and a history of struggling with MH.

2022 was my breaking point for me. I am thankful my nparent allowed me to temporarily stay at their place when I was looking for a place to live. But two weeks after returning to my home country to look for a job and find a home for my husband to reside in, they do a family intervention demanding I get tested for autism. I said no and no means no right? Not to them it doesn’t. Should I have shown them the one video about tea and consent? Probably? But that might’ve created even more animosity. So my life was made a misery my entire stay of 3 months until one of my sisters (the GC not the former scapegoat who wrote the above) - made an ultimatum to my NMom while on my deceased sibling’s anniversary at a very public restaurant (as is the fashion mid crash out) that it’s either me or her.  And my NMom told me to look for someplace to live.

So I did and I ended up having to safely move mine and my spouses items to a friend’s house because who knows what will happen when a mom eventually also crashes out because she has a history of destroying my stuff. The wedding certificate had to be transported safely first because if that got destroyed I had to return to that country to get a copy. There was a lot of stress they put on me on top of the nasty verbal stuff and as a kid until early adulthood the physical.

I left that house and was homeless for 3 months. I didn’t feel safe. Things fell into place and ever since they’ve been trying to look towards reconciling but it’s always the same DARVO stuff with them. Even my spouse is shocked by the lack of apology from that time and the lack of respecting my wishes as a grown adult. They say it enough that I’m “this age” already and I should be more like “that”. 

My spouse never held me up to that impossible standard. They just want me to relax and they see me wound up and it stresses and hurts them too. They don’t know how best to comfort me sometimes but I think they do a really good job.

A part of me doesn’t want to respond to this message. I could see the manipulation a mile off. It makes me sad that the sister I once got along well with has chosen a side after constantly feeling oppressed and super low from said side. 

She keeps trying to pressure me for an answer but what can I even say to that? I was clear about my boundary that I don’t want to go. I didn’t even deny a possibility of meeting up but for only when I’m ready. I am sure my parents would be about should she meet with me. And I’m not ready for that. I’m not ready for my spouse to even be remotely around them - to hear them talk about me in a way that is super infantilising. Because my spouse is associated with me they’ll likely treat my spouse the same and yeah he has no tolerance for that kind of behavior. My parents accused us both of so much when I put my foot down and said no to the autism test thing and the life360. __Accused me of (absolutely unfounded btw):__

1. Drugs(?!???)

2. Plotting to steal their inheritance (?!??????) firstly what?

3. DV(?!?) - their proof? “You only say nice things about your spouse”.

I’m not perfect by any means, I know I’ve still got things to improve on myself. But to be accused of doing things when I’m about as by the book as it comes is just hilariously painful to listen to.",1,1748252871.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

The best part is we were welcomed in at 9am and checked into our room at 9:30am. (Nothing like a shower, post flight across the pond.)

Breakfast every morning was absolutely insane. It used to be more of a buffet, now it’s more of a menu based service. However, you can pick any dish and the breakfast tower if you want. Fresh OJ, Green drinks, coffee all included. Usually tipped €5-€10

Housekeeping was constant and the room was always beautiful, smelled great (choose your own scent) and tons of waters. 

We also enjoyed the Spa one afternoon, and Diamonds get 30 minutes of free treatment, so we snagged that 90 minute massage!

Future Mate,

I’m a guy in my late 20s looking to build a solid, long-term friendship with someone who’s also keen on something deeper than just surface-level chat or the occasional pub catch-up.

Not after a quick mate for drinks and footy once every few months, although they would be nice. I’m talking real connections. Someone to hang out with regularly online or offline, talk life, unwind, get into some good banter, and actually show up as a mate.

I’ve got a good life and all the usual responsibilities, but something’s missing... a mate who’s down for road trips, late-night chats, dogs at the park, maybe even some “life unpacking” over coffee or a fire pit.

What I’m not after: fake energy, flakey chats, judgement or drugs.

What I am after: consistency, laughs, honesty, emotions, vulnerability, and depth.

Comment below and I will reach out, or feel free to message me directly.

I'd love to share some selfies, talk about deal breakers first up to avoid wasting each other's time and fast tracking if we have the potential to connect even.

1kvq9u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1kvq9u1/why_vb6_is_still_haunting_your_erp_how_to_escape/,Why VB6 Is Still Haunting Your ERP: How to Escape the Legacy Trap (and Save Millions),"Ever feel like your ERP system has a ghost? If it’s still built on VB6, you do. Microsoft officially “ended support” for the VB6 IDE in 2008, so your ancient apps aren’t getting any updates, patches, or feature love. In fact, the VB6 runtime only survives as part of the Windows OS; its only life support is tied to Windows’ own lifecycle. (Hint: Windows 8 support ran out in 2023, and Windows 10 extended support wraps in 2025.) Bottom line: VB6 is dead, yet millions of business-critical lines of VB6 code still run every day in manufacturing shops, clinics, and accounting back-ends.

So why is it still around? Blame inertia: VB6 was beloved for its RAD IDE and simplicity. But today keeping VB6 means dragging around technical debt that grinds ROI, security, and innovation to a halt. As one CIO humorously put it, VB6 skills are “becoming scarce and expensive” because “most programmers prefer newer languages”. In practice that means your team is paying a premium or cycling through temps just to keep lights on. Meanwhile, the checklist of VB6’s sins reads like a horror movie resume: no security patches, no modern encryption, no multi-core performance, no mobile apps – just a one-way ticket to O&M hell.

The *business* risks of VB6 are huge. Legacy VB6 apps often run with elevated privileges (“Run as Administrator” is a constant headache) and use ancient libraries that are prime targets for hackers. Abto Software warns that outdated VB6 code faces “security vulnerabilities – you might risk everything” by standing still. Remember HIPAA and GDPR? In healthcare settings especially, the technical safeguards (encryption, access logs, audit trails) aren’t grandfathered in – legacy VB6 almost guarantees non-compliance. Abto’s analysis of healthcare breaches shows VB6-era systems rarely use modern encryption or logging, which means every patient record is a potential liability. Simply put, if sensitive data is locked in a VB6 app, you’re tempting fate (and regulators) every day.

Beyond security, there’s *opportunity cost*. VB6 apps can’t easily tap into cloud, mobile or AI. You end up with slow, monolithic interfaces, while competitors ship mobile-friendly features and AI analytics. The LinkedIn CIO even pointed out VB6 “may limit the ability of companies to innovate… such as mobile access, cloud computing, artificial intelligence or user interface design”. And since VB6 is 32-bit only, it won’t utilize modern hardware efficiently. You’re effectively paying to stay behind.

# ERP and Legacy Systems: A Case Study in Pain

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems are especially notorious VB6 survivors. Remember, in the ’90s VB6 *was* cutting-edge, so many bespoke ERP and accounting solutions were built on it. Fast forward to now: imagine your mission-critical inventory or billing system is on VB6. Every patch, every new report is a gamble.

Real-world cases tell the tale. In one story, a midsize manufacturer ran its entire ERP on VB6 plus an Access database – built in the 1990s – and suffered “poor performance, limited access, and security concerns.” After migrating to a modern web stack (ASP.NET Core, React, Azure), they achieved *100% remote access*, slashed helpdesk tickets by 95%, tripled data-entry speed, and *eliminated downtime*. In other words, ditching VB6 turned an overtaxed legacy ERP into a fast, scalable cloud system that literally *saved millions* in productivity. Another Mobilize.Net case highlights a VB6 app grown over decades into a whole ERP. Maintenance became “increasingly difficult” as VB6-savvy staff retired, so they used an automated tool to convert it to VB.NET/WinForms on .NET. Post-migration, the company could maintain and evolve the system like any modern .NET app.

These stories aren’t flukes. Sticking with a VB6 ERP means paying unusually high TCO: constant workarounds, frozen feature sets, and expensive bridging tools just to eek out functionality. In contrast, a refreshed .NET-based ERP means better performance, web/mobile interfaces, and a future-proof platform. Plus it frees up your team to build new capabilities – or hire developers without VB6 on their resumes.

# Healthcare’s Cautionary Tale

If ERP is the business head of the snake, healthcare is the tail that bites. Hospitals and clinics often have legacy clinical and administrative apps built in VB6. Abto’s industry report lists recent massive health data breaches and notes how legacy systems exacerbate the problem. For example, VB6 systems “haven’t received updates or patches” since 2008, leaving doors wide open for exploits. They also tend to use outdated encryption and have *no modern logging*, violating HIPAA’s technical rules. Abto bluntly warns: keeping VB6 is practically “introducing new vulnerabilities” by handicapping your ability to detect and prevent attacks.

Bottom line: regulators don’t care that your ERP or EHR is 20 years old. If PHI (protected health info) leaks because of outdated code, the fines (up to millions per violation) and reputation hit can swamp any short-term savings. The ghosts of VB6 can leave a literal monetary trail in the tens of millions once HIPAA breaches hit the news.

# How to Migrate from VB6 (Without Losing Your Mind)

Okay, your boat is sinking – what now? Migration looks scary, but it’s doable. The most common path is moving VB6 logic onto .NET. Microsoft’s “visual basic” post-2008 advice has been basically “go to VB.NET or C#”, and tooling supports that: the old Upgrade Wizard (hah) or third-party converters (like Mobilize VBUC, VB Migration Partner, etc.) can translate VB6 code to VB.NET or C# semi-automatically. Outsourcing partners like Abto Software offer end-to-end migration: they “conduct VB6 to C# and VB6 to .NET migration” for performance, security and futureproofing (Abto boasts they even add modern perks like “data security and powerful AI features” on the new platform).

It’s key to be realistic: no magic button exists. Plan an **incremental migration**. Break the app into modules or phases, move one piece at a time, and keep part of the system live while you port the rest. Use automation *with caution* – it can bulk-convert forms and code skeletons, but “no tools can convert legacy applications without failing certain components” (think custom DLLs or API calls). Expect to manually tweak code and rebuild UIs. And test obsessively: Abto’s advice is to “test early and often” (unit, integration, UAT) as you go. Essentially, treat it like a delicate house move: pack a bit, check nothing’s broken, then move on.

Migrating data is part of it too. Many VB6 apps used Jet/Access or old databases. That data needs a new home (SQL Server, cloud DB, etc.) with a proper import plan. And don’t forget integration – new systems talk differently, so APIs or middleware may be needed. It’s not trivial, but the alternative (running a business on unsupported stone tablets) is worse.

**What about cost?** Project cost depends on factors like code size, complexity, and how much you refactor. Yes, you’ll pay developers and perhaps licensing for tools. But consider ROI: A modern .NET system can introduce new revenue models. For instance, one retailer migrated its VB6 point-of-sale to a web app and “switched from a license model to subscription model”, gaining stable recurring revenue. It also leveraged Azure for auto-scaling and cut development time from years to months. In effect, the rewrite paid for itself in agility and new business.

Think of it this way: VB6’s real cost is invisible bleeding. Every minute you spend wrestling with it is a minute lost in innovation (not to mention the millions you’d lose in a breach or compliance fine).

# Bottom Line: Don’t Wait for the Furnace

By now the message should be clear (and if it’s not, read it again with a coffee). VB6 isn’t just old-school; it’s a legacy *time bomb* for ERP and healthcare software. The queries you’ve googled – “how to migrate from VB6”, “VB6 migration cost”, “VB6 support end date”, “modern alternatives” – all point to the same answer: Do it yesterday.

Get help if you need it. Firms like Abto Software exist precisely to shepherd this painful process. They (and others) will tell you it’s a journey, not a flip. But the reward is huge: lower TCO, stronger security, regulatory peace-of-mind, and the freedom to add new features and technologies. In short, you escape the legacy trap *and* save big bucks in the long run (sometimes literally millions).

It was grey, windy, wet and the thought of staying in bed was there. However walking from Carrick Knowe I reached 11 miles at musselborough and thought I can push this further ! Preston pans marked mile 15 in my Journey. You might be thinking what's in the photo well that's how far I was from Arthur seat (on the right side). That picture captures Edinburgh, portobello and musselborough. 

I don't know know what happened when I hit 32 but my perspective of what I wanted my weekend to look like is completely different.  Not hungover, lying in bed and waisting a day but getting up and breathing in the air, that mental clarity you get with sobriety and a couple of cheeky tan lines (maybe even a little burnt). 

Sobriety has given me a whole perspective of what a weekend looks to me. Some people might find it boring or crazy to ruck 26.2 miles on a Saturday but for me it's where I find peace and being able to push and challenge myself is a gift ! 

If anyone in or around Edinburgh has any other long walking suggestions I'm all ears :)

Am I wrong for distancing myself from a close friend because she got close with someone who betrayed my trust? 

Context: 
I’ve had a circle of friends since 2022—we met in school and are now in college. I was especially close with one girl in the group, and we basically became best friends. Even when we ended up in different schools in 2023, we still saw each other regularly to hang out, go to coffee shops, and catch up on life. I trusted her deeply and shared a lot of personal stuff, including my struggles and private life.

Fast forward to this year: we haven’t been seeing each other much due to internships. She got assigned to a different city with another girl from our friend group who I’m not particularly close with. This girl had already caused issues in the group before—she leaked some of our private group chat convos, and even though it was proven that she did it, my best friend didn’t seem to believe it.

While they were on their internship together (I was miles away), I found out that this same girl talked to my best friend about my personal relationship with my boyfriend. That really hurt me because:

1. I never share details about my love life with the group.
2. She doesn’t even know my boyfriend.
3. I wasn’t even there to speak for myself.
   Later on, I learned that she even spread issues about me and my relationship to other people.

To make things worse, they now have a new circle of friends from their internship—and these were the same people they badmouthed to me the last time we all met. From that moment, I realized: I don’t want this for myself. I don’t want to be part of an environment where people talk behind each other’s backs, act fake, and twist stories. It just felt toxic.

Previous attempts: 
So I messaged my best friend and told her I’d be lying low from the group for a while because I felt betrayed. I made it clear I appreciated her honesty for telling me what the other girl said, and that I didn’t have any issues with her personally—I just didn’t want to associate with people who disrespected my boundaries and privacy.

She never replied.

Now, we don’t talk at school, and I see her hanging out and getting even closer with the girl who talked behind my back. She even removed me as a follower and deleted our photos together.

I am hurt but I am also not afraid to burn bridges for my peace. I feel hurt cause I lost a best friend, and everyone knows that I really care for her and I treated her like a sister, but I also feel like I was right to set boundaries. Still, part of me wonders...

Am I wrong for feeling hurt and distancing myself? Am I wrong for not talking to her personally about this?

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.

Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""

Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""

Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'

It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.

Ashwood had a glossy cover story—something about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.

Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation—until she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.

The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest—his childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.

""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""

""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""

Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'

Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""

Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""

Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""

Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

# Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.

Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.

Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""

He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""

Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'

Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""

Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""

She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""

Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'

She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""

""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""

He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton—the admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.

But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""

""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical—saving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""

Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I—""

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""",2,1748251706.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I think it's partly bad luck because the first few days there was an international dinner and tours and I got sick so I couldn't meet people. I didn't know about ESN either, but even if I did I wouldn't have anyone to go to events with and I wouldn't even go alone because I don't feel that people are interested enough to talk to me and when I try to start a conversation they cross my face. My roomates are all older and doing PhDs and had no interest in Erasmus events or going out in general. On three occasions I texted three different people I met to see if they wanted to do something like go for a coffee: one didn't reply and the other two said they couldn't because of something else. At first I thought I would make friends at some point, but months went by and I realised that I spent every day at home alone watching TV series. I don't know. I would have loved to go out partying or whatever, to do something, but I don't have anyone even if I tried. We are now in the exam period and I have to study but if I try again with any of those three people they will probably say no for the same reason.

How do I answer the questions ""How was your Erasmus?"" It was lonely, it was terrible, there were weeks when I didn't leave the house . I think that's the worst thing, what do I say when someone asks me? I'm ashamed to say it was depressing.

Arielle's pov;

I could always tell when he approached his office. A musk scent would fill the room. My heart would beat a little faster and my breath got a little shorter. This was always the case even for that morning.

""Good morning Mr Quinnell,"" I whispered as he walked in.

""Morning Arielle."" ""Can I see you for a moment in my office?"" He replied his voice cold.

It always was but that morning it was a little bit colder than usual.

""Yes sir,"" I replied obligingly following him into his office.

I knew exactly why he had called me into his office and I dreaded whatever it was that he was about to say to me. A little part of me though hoped that it was going to be a positive response but deep down I knew that that was just wishful thinking.

I had feelings for Mr Quinnell. Working as his assistant for five years now. In all that time I had never once seen him as anything more than the menacing figure that he set himself out to be. All that had suddenly changed one day. Since then all I ever wanted was for him to see me as a woman, not as an employee.

""What is this Arielle?"" he asked holding up his phone to my face.

At that moment I did not know what to say to him. I just stood there my feet frozen to the ground. The previous night I had had way too many drinks and ended up confessing my feelings to him on the phone and when he hung up on me I had written a lengthy text explaining what I felt for him and in lengthy detail at that.

""I asked what is the meaning of this damn it!"" His voice echoed through the office and in that moment I felt my legs get wobbly.

""I am so sorry sir, I…..I…..""

""You what? Finish your damn sentences!""

This was the first time he ever used such a tone with me. He had never raised his voice at me before. I had heard him shout at his other subordinates but he had never shouted at me. To me, he was always so sweet and gentle and he treated me like a cub. I felt tears burn my eyes threatening to flow if I said one more word and a lump rose to my throat blocking my voice.

""Talk I said!""

In this moment I took several steps back retreating to the locked door with my hands behind my back and my head facing the ground. Seeing me retreat, he moved from behind his desk and headed towards me. He took my hand from behind my back and firmly squeezed it and with his other hand he cupped my face and lifted it to look at him.

""Listen to me, Arielle."" His eyes turned black. I saw in them rage burning deep.

I felt my heart sink. I knew clearly that the words to follow would not only crush my heart into powder but burn the living hell out of me. Here he was the man I thought to be my one true mate about to reject me and to my face at that after I had contemplated for months whether to confess or not. I knew the consequences of my actions would either be grave or completely fulfilling. If he accepted me I would have found my mate but if he did not then I would be doomed.

""You are nothing to me. You mean absolutely nothing."" ""You are just a low rank Omega and you dared to confess your feelings for The Alpha?""

That hurt. It hurt worse than I would have ever imagined. It felt like my soul had just left my body. I felt like a carcass at that moment. I could no longer fight back the tears so I removed my face from his hand and let the tears flow. As the warm tears rolled down my cheeks I realized just what a grave mistake I had made and in that moment there was nothing I wanted more than for the earth to open up and swallow me.

""And just so you know I would never claim you as my mate in a million years. You are just a weakling and how could you ever imagine becoming the Luna of my pack? You could never! Get that in your head!""

These words cut me. They cut deeper than any celestial blade could. I broke free from his arms.

""Excuse me,"" I said exiting the room.

I could no longer stand being anywhere around him so I headed out. I spent the whole day running errands. Holding myself together even though my body threatened to break down at every turn.

As I walked home that night I felt listless and empty.

I tried calling Scout, my best friend, but I kept getting redirected to voicemail. I felt short of breath and my heart felt like it had a heavy weight pressing on it. I wanted to just be somewhere far away from myself. I then got a text from Scout.

'Hi Ari, meet me at Westend Club, I'll be waiting, love you'

This was not a time that I wanted to go to any club but I knew that if I went home I would just end up crying all night so I just went to meet Scout.

I told him everything that had happened and at the very end, I was on the verge of tears.

""Come here Ari,"" Scout said pulling me in for a hug. ""He is simply not worthy of you and I am pretty sure that he isn't your mate,"" Scout said with such surety in his eyes that I found comforting.

But still, I knew that Mr Quinnell was my mate. I was very sure of it.

"" Scout you know that if I don't find my mate soon I will die alone,"" I whispered in between sniffles.

""No, you won't die alone, and besides I already know who your fated mate is."" He said pulling himself out of the hug and looking me in the eyes to show that he was not joking.

# Chapter 2

""What!"" I asked.

I thought that my ears might be failing me for a second there.

"" I said, I know who your fated mate is,"" Scout repeated shouting so that I could hear him better.

""Stop joking around.""

Being one of the few werewolves, my age, who had not found their mate, the topic of fated mates was a sensitive topic. Scout always claimed that he had found him but refused to tell me who no matter how much I begged him to.

""I will tell you later but for now have a drink and forget all about him,"" he said.

I knew that no matter how much I tried to convince him to tell me he would not so I just gave up. Mates was the only secret that Scout ever hid from me. I did not quite understand why but he did. We never kept anything from each other but he drew the line at his mate and as much as I wanted him to open up about it I knew that pursuing the issue any further would only push him away. He was the person I held most dear to me so I simply let it go.

Scout ordered a few drinks and a few shots later I could feel them kicking in. I was the reckless type of drunk. I would often make bad decisions on a drunk night and although the decision I was about to make that night would seem horrible at first it would turn out to be the best decision I would ever make for myself.

""Let's dance Scout,"" I shouted in between giggles already on the dance floor.

""You're drunk Ari, get back here, "" said Scout.

""No, I wanna dance, pretty please,"" I said pouting like a baby.

Scout looked at me a slight twinkle in his eyes that he always had whenever I behaved like a kid. That twinkle was always accompanied by a slight smirk.

""Whatever Ari, dance your heart out and forget about that idiot who doesn't deserve you,"" he whispered into my heart, having now joined me on the dance floor.

""Don't talk about him that way you know he's your Alpha,"" I whispered giggling.

""But he can't hear me.""

We laughed it out.

Even in my drunken state, my senses were always hyperactive thanks to my wolf part. At that point, I could feel a burning gaze on my back. I could feel that someone was watching me. At first, I thought that it was because I was not dressed for the occasion as I was still in my work clothes having had no time to change. Still, it was acceptable enough that security allowed me in.

I turned around to tell Scout but he had moved towards the bar already so I just ignored it and kept dancing. At that moment I felt someone grab my waist. It was the most disgusting thing I had felt the whole day.

""Hey! Let go of me you creep!"" I shouted turning around to look at who it was.

""C'mon, I know you like it."" Said the middle-aged man who looked bent out of shape. He tightened his grip around my waist.

""I said let go!"" I shouted once more trying to pull away but his grip on my waist was too strong.

I started screaming but he put his hand over my mouth. I was on the other end of the dance floor. Scout could not see me and my strength was weakened by the alcohol so I was at his mercy. I felt completely defenseless and at the mercy of a stranger whose intentions seemed crystal clear. The tears that I had tried holding back while on the dance floor, all came streaming down.

""Don't cry."" He whispered on my ear lobe licking it a little bit. I could feel his saliva and hot stinky breath on my skin and it made me feel so dirty.

""She said let go, you idiot!"" A deep voice shouted from behind.

I looked up to see a tall figure standing right behind the man.

""Why don't you move along and mind your own business, huh?"" replied the man his hand having shifted to my wrist now.

""I won't until you let go of her!""

""And what if I don't?""

In a split second, the tall figure held the creep by the neck threatening to break it. His other hand slowly broke the creep's fingers one after the other. He screamed in pain but amid the chaotic room echoing loudly with the music hardly anyone heard him.

I stood still shaking like a leaf but the dark lifeless eyes of the tall figure told me that the fingers were not the only thing that he was going to break. I moved closer to him and tugged at his suit.

""Please let go of him. I think he has now learned his lesson."" I said looking at him with pleading eyes.

He looked at me for a while his eyes still lifeless, then he let go of the man. The creep crushed to the floor coughing his heart out before he crawled away groaning in pain.

""Thank you, sir,"" I said letting go of his shirt.

""Are you okay?"" he asked me.

""Yes, I am.""

At that moment I looked down and noticed his claws. I took a step back. Even though I grew up a werewolf around others it still shocked me to see one in the human world. Noticing my eyes shift to his claws he quickly retracted them. I thanked him again and started walking away.

A hand pulled me back into his chest. His scent was hypnotizing. He smelled like snow and the wind. In the next moment, he laid his lips on mine. My eyes popped open as I felt the warmth of his lips on mine. He immediately noticed my shock and pulled away.

""I am sorry miss."" He said softly letting go of my hand.

Overcome by some sort of temptation and desire I pulled on his suit and kissed him. His hand reached around my waist and I got lost in the heat.

# Chapter 3

I had just gotten rejected by the Alpha of my pack in the morning whom I had thought to be my fated mate and here I was at night making out with a man I knew nothing of.

I felt a sensation ripple through my body as he drew a line along my back. Before I could make sense of what was going on we were back at his house. His hand reached for the button on my shirt.

""May I?"" he asked in between kisses.

Without hesitation, I nodded giving him the go-ahead signal. He picked me up from the ground and put my legs around his waist. He kissed with a passion that burned deeper than the fiery pits of hell. He then put me on top of the marble kitchen island. Going down on his knees he pulled my pants off. With his hands, he held my legs apart. His tongue then proceeded to penetrate me eating me up like I was his last meal. My hand reached for his head as a soft moan left my lips. I felt my body tremble. He looked up and smirked at me. He lifted me and carried me in his hands up the stairs and laid me on the bed. He unbuttoned my shirt and started kissing the nape of my neck. His tongue swiftly went to my neck and moved on to my boobs. He reached his hand behind my back and unhooked my bra removing it and letting it fall on the floor.

His tongue proceeded to do wonders to my nipples and in that moment I felt the space in between my legs throb like crazy. His tongue moved along my stomach and stopped on my lower abdomen. My hand which was now on his back dug deep into his skin my claws coming forth.

He removed my skirt and then removed his shirt. In better lighting, I could now see him better. He was tall and pale-skinned, his eyes were still lifeless, but a burning flame of desire lit up in them seeming as though it would burn anything to satisfy itself, and his physique was out of this world.

He parted my legs and his hand swept over my thighs as he went down and started kissing them. When one of his hands swept up as if to reach into me, I flinched and my reflexes clumped his head in between my thighs. Embarrassed I turned away and opened my legs once more. At this point, I thought he would be turned off and leave even though the desire in my body burned greater than the pits of hell.

Instead, it only seemed to have deepened his desire.

""I will start slow, I can tell it's your first time."" He whispered when he came up to breathe.

My face turned red. He wet two of his fingers and proceeded to insert them into my opening. A soft moan left my lips and my pussy tightened around his fingers. Aroused by this I could see his bulging self threatening to rip open his pants. My hands free I decided to tease him like he had teased me. I placed my hand around his member and rubbed my hand on it.

A groan left his lips as he cupped my hand in his and pressed it against his member. I then pulled my hand away and clasped the sheets unable to withstand my craving anymore.

""I will make you regret that princess."" He whispered into my ears.

He took his fingers out and licked them before he proceeded to unbuckle his belt and release the monster behind. My gaze fell on his member and my jaw dropped. Aroused now his member had awakened and I couldn't even clasp it in my hand. He proceeded to carefully insert himself into me, ensuring that it wouldn't hurt as much.

""It will only hurt for a little while."" He said his voice full of genuine concern.

He kept his member in me until I adjusted to the pain then he started thrusting slowly.

""Zayne, that is the name I want to hear you scream."" He said his surge of surety visible in his voice.

He then proceeded to increase the pace of his thrust. A surge of pleasure washed all over me covering the pain I had felt just a few seconds ago. My claws sunk into his skin making him bleed. I screamed and moaned with every thrust. He whimpered and groaned. Every time I screamed his name he would go faster, deeper, and harder.

In that moment of ecstasy and pleasure, he went to the nape of my neck and bit into me. He knotted and ejaculated in me. He marked me and proceeded to whisper;

""I now claim you as mine.""

Drowned at the moment I felt a surging rush through me and I experienced the true peak of mating, his words were drowned out by the pleasure I felt at the moment.

We proceeded to stay in that position with him laying on top of me kissing every corner of my body until his knot wore off.

I then fell asleep and that was the best sleep I had had after months of insomnia, with him lying on my bare chest.

The next morning I woke up to find a stranger laying his head on my chest. Parts of the night were a blur. Looking around the room it all came flooding back. I realized the gravity of my actions after I recalled that he had marked me as his mate. I was dumbfounded but at the moment my biggest concern was to leave the place as fast as possible and go home.

I tried to slip away but he held my hand firmly. I finally petted him till he was relaxed and went back to sleep. I took my clothes off the floor and dressed up ready to leave.

""Where are you going, mate?"" A deep voice asked

I turned around to find Zayne staring at me his lifeless eyes seeming to search my soul for answers to questions he had asked verbally and those that he hadn't.

""I'm sorry I have to leave for now,"" I replied running off.

""I will find you mate"" I heard a voice echo through the hallway as I ran towards the elevator.

# Chapter 4

I got back to my apartment at around six in the morning. I fumbled through my purse for my keys but I could not find them. Luckily my door also used a passcode so I input the code and went inside. I was supposed to be at work in two hours so I headed straight to the bathroom and took the longest shower of my life.

That was my first time and I had shamelessly done it with a stranger whom I knew nothing about. After I took a shower, I dried my hair and then got ready for work. Throughout my routine, my mind kept replaying the previous night like a movie on a loop. I found myself fantasizing over and over about this mystery man.

Then it hit me, his name, Zayne. Or maybe that was not his name but a nickname he had branded himself for such activities which before that day I had thought that I would do with my fated mate and it would feel like magic. I will not deny the fact that it felt better than anything I had ever experienced in my life but I thought with my fated mate it would feel like I was floating on clouds.

I snapped back to reality when I realized that I had to go to work. I had to see Mr Quinnell who the previous day had rejected me in the most degrading and humiliating manner known to my kind and maybe that was why I had ended up in the arms of another man who made me feel seen and desired. I had refused to quit my job because I not only had to make a living but I also knew I could not get away from him after all he was the Alpha of my pack.

I locked my door after I was done and headed to work ready for a day I knew would be filled with embarrassment and shame. As I walked into the office I could feel their eyes burn my skin with questions and their whispers which they made obvious by trying to make it not so obvious.

""I heard she confessed to the Alpha claiming to be his mate.""

""Yes, and he rejected her.""

""What did she expect? To be made our Luna?""

""I know right, like that is so embarrassing.""

""If I were her, I would have already quit and moved away.""

""She will live as a lone wolf her whole life.""

""True, who would want to mark a rejected mate?""

These whispers burnt through me and hurt me more than I was ready to show so I just pretended not to care and to be cool with it and even though tears threatened to flow like rivers I just held my head high.

Walking to my desk which was right outside his office I wondered what was going through his head at the moment. Was he happy that he had made me a laughingstock? But then again I had done this to myself all by myself.

""Good morning sir,"" I stood to greet him as usual but this time I did not smile and just held my head low.

""Morning Arielle"" he answered with a tone so indifferent to everything that had happened but it seemed to hold within it contempt.

""Could you grab me my usual coffee? I forgot it on my way up.""

""Yes sir, of course,"" I answered

My head was still held low and his apathy seemed to pull at my heartstrings as tears threatened to stream down once more. I knew that I was a crybaby. I had been informed of this fact a lot before but it seemed that whenever I was emotional tears always followed, whether I was happy, sad, or angry. I left and headed to the coffee shop grabbing both his order and mine to go. The caffeine in my iced coffee seemed to swallow back the tears and put me back in a better mood.

I knocked on the door to his office and his deep voice ushered me in. I walked in to find the man from the previous night seated on the guest seats. When he saw me he stood up and smiled. My heart beat so fast that I felt like it would pop out of my chest at any moment. The coffee in my hand slipped and fell to the floor spilling all over the rug. Mr Quinnell who seemed to be unaware of the situation looked at me shocked at my clumsiness. He seemed to want to say something but the tall, pale-skinned man beat him to it.

""Hello, wife."" His voice echoed.

I felt a whirlwind of emotions sweep through the room.

""Wife?"" Mr Quinnell inquired shocked and angry at whatever drama was occurring in his office.

I wanted to explain that it meant nothing and that there was no way I was married to this man but he beat me to it.

""Yes Mr Quinnell, wife, this beautiful woman you see here is my Luna.""

These words struck me into oblivion.

""Mr Ravenscroft, this is no time for jokes right after you walked into my territory without any prior warning.""

Mr Ravenscroft? He was the Alpha of the Remun pack which owned a territory right beside my pack. The Blue Moon pack. I had just mated and been marked by an Alpha of the rival pack.

""Ravenscroft? "" I managed to work in between my sort of panic attack.

""Yes, dear wifey?"" He answered

""Mr Ravenscroft!"" Shouted Mr Quinnell his voice echoing through the building.

""I came to take my wife and mate with me. I hope you have no problem with that Mr Quinnell."" Answered Zayne calmly but his eyes burning red with rage.

""I rejected her yesterday and she belongs to my pack you can not make her your Luna."" Growled Mr Quinnell. Then he turned to me, ""Did you betray your pack? Answer me !""

But now I’m trying to level up and improve the little things that keep holding me back: 

Cigarettes after meals or with coffee , too much coffee, a drink (or two) after work, out of boredom or to destress, taking melatonin to sleep instead of building a real bedtime routine, always thinking about starting a diet but never sticking to it

It’s not like my life is falling apart, it’s not. But I’d love to be sharper, healthier, maybe save a bit more money, maybe having the energy to pick up a new hobby and just be more focused.

girl here. i saw a post earlier that read, ""girls respond: how do you actually approach a woman?"" the comments were predominantly men advising each other to be direct. however, what you need to know is that the cold approach, like all forms of meaningful human interaction, is a proper art. and since women are emotionally very in-tune, you need to respond to subtexts and subtleties even if you might see nothing wrong more explicitly. and regardless of what you want to believe, there are more than enough cases where women find men (that they would not have initially liked) attractive based on their mannerisms and attitudes of mind.

this is literally the only way that i would go out with someone from a cold approach. i hope it is all-inclusive, though i will update if i realize i'm forgetting anything. the few relationships i've been in have each been very successful and intense and actually all stemmed from cold approaches, so i feel that i have some level of substantive insight on this topic. and although i found the guys i dated very attractive in those moments and during those relationships, i would have rejected them regardless if they had approached me the way usually prescribed to the common public by other men.

consider that your success will obviously be influenced by additional factors like your self-grooming / behavior / general vibe / other appearances. if you have boogers sticking out of your nose, she might not hear anything you say. and if you do as my suggestion but come off as very angry or aggressive, then there may be more deep-seated, specific issues you may want to first target. whether you are successful or not will also depend on the girl and what point of her life she is in.

method:

approach her in a noninvasive way, and don't immediately show romantic interest.

make this interaction **the** first interaction (ie: the first date; this is your first impression and encounter). this means: make it memorable, and try to extend it into the immediate future instead of creating the burden of a plan.

maybe say, ""hey, i've seen you around a couple of times; would you be down to get coffee after ... \[whatever it is that you happen to be doing together\]?"" this makes it feel very open, and it also communicates that even if you two went out and talked, she would not feel intimidated or forced into something romantic. it offers the possibility that you could be friends or other, too, and (even if you don't want this option) showing that this exit sign exists is very comforting for the other party, giving off much less pressure (it's like taking a half-step instead of a full step; there is less weighing on me from this, and so i would be much more inclined to go through with it).

also, this creates an immediate progression that i, as a woman, can ease into without feeling hunted, making the interaction continuous from our initial introduction, and creating very natural flow. this very effectively makes you no longer a stranger and wordlessly establishes that both of us will have the freedom to learn about the other, just as real people do.

do **not** immediately ask for phone number. if she wants to give you her number and meet some other time, she will do so; let it be suggested.

first of all, what gives you the right to invade my space just because you want something from me? if you're attracted to me, it's already implied that you want something (so you should attempt to minimize how this comes off). but to start off by explicitly demanding that i literally **give** you something, you are sabotaging your own chances and building contempt even before any sort of rapport.

moreover, there's a weird blank space if you, as a stranger, have my phone number and thus have access to contact me without me having any identity confirmation or initial background check on you. sure, someone might feel pressured to give you their number if they are too nice and don't know how to reject others; but it generally feels uncomfortable, especially if the transaction wasn't wanted and created internal turmoil, and this therefore ruins how you are perceived further into the relation since you are already causing mild discomfort.

also, asking for phone number will make you seem very common, and it's generally disrespectful. it makes me assume that you're trying to collect phone numbers from every girl you find nice to look at, and if you did so why should i add to this endeavor? why should i embarrass myself in that way? it is insulting for you to imply to my face that you expect me to be someone who will respond to or want to serve random strangers' interests.

(i'm not saying that asking for numbers never works; but i am saying that, if it works, it's only because something else is overcompensating; eg: the girl already liking the guy a lot, or even just the generally lower self esteem on the girl's part or her fear of what might happen otherwise. either way, this starts you off on a bad footing, and you could just do better, so i don't recommend.)

\*\* please !! hold the compliments about appearance until after you build some level of rapport. it's flattering that you think i look attractive if i know you on some level, but otherwise this is unwarranted and comes off as invasive again, especially as i'm not asking to be perceived and subjectively judged by strangers. if someone walked up to you and said, ""i noticed the bulge in your pants,"" sure, it's okay for them to perceive that, but it is incredibly rude and invasive to go out of their way and say it to you, implying they want something out of that ""appreciation.""

also, negging is so gross; please don't do it. it's so uncultured, so unrefined. laughing awkwardly does not mean that somebody enjoys your presence. you might be able to manipulate someone very vulnerable in the very very short term, but you never want someone to think of you just because you make them uncomfortable. also, we will be talking about this to our friends, flabbergasted and with great disapproval. this always comes up in girl-talks. if you have a pattern of insulting the person you like, you need to realize that you are making them feel negative emotions in response to your words, and their minds will effectively create strong correlations (even if subconscious) between you and these negative emotions.

finally,

if a girl likes you, most often she won't explicitly ""make the next move,"" but she will implicitly do so.

what i mean is that : she will guide you to make the next move. if it seems like she isn't interested, she probably isn't or (best case) isn't sure about you at this time. in this case, you can ask more explicitly to confirm; say something like ""can i see you next week?"" or ""hey, where do you want this to go?"" if she really does not want to help you make a move, that's an answer. take it as one and move on. there are many people in this world who will love you; see it as a responsibility to yourself that you find these people and that you are good to them.

going on a date:

if you are sure about your romantic pursuit of this relationship, and you are not in that stage of deliberating whether or not to just be friends, i suggest that you pay for this date. you don't ""need"" to, but it does bolster the case against you (if you think of your candidacy as a two-part scale) since a woman's social capital does decrease once she is with a man, and since being more picky is inherent for us as we are biologically geared towards having a limited window of time for ""settling down.""

please:

don't create any pressure for intimacy, and make sure to follow up quickly. i've seen a lot of my friends overthink the late responses and ghost the guy altogether, even if he responds a couple days later; this is just generally a very common case. after the date, send a text that same day, saying something like, ""hey, thanks for coming out today. i had a really nice time. when can i see you again?"" -bonus points if you mention something from their conversation in a fitting, subtle way.
and, if you want to pursue physical things, you should make this seem a result of you being so into them, desiring them so fully that you could not help but to want this. that way the sex does not become the perceived final goal but one stepping stone or even result of the overall attraction/developing relationship.

realize:

\[initial feelings carry on a lot. upon going on a date, you may think that everything on the date went well, only to get ghosted a few days later. the initial emotions you convey –though they may be easily forgotten by you– will create a lasting imprint that may re-emerge for the other party in later retrospection, once she has enough information about you to fully look through that mental file on you and analyze your interactions and character. i've seen so many could-have-beens fall apart because something said irrationally and erratically (do **not** talk about your previous sexual encounters on the first few dates). as such, the first date and the few following are very important, and very closely followed up second date can really well supplement or even make up for the first date since it is before this first comprehensive ""evaluation.""\]

i hope this helps you.

if you don't agree with me or don't understand something said here, please don't personally reach out to me about this. but feel free to share your experiences in the comments !! i am wishing for you great love and beautiful experiences.

i understand that, usually, women on these types of public forums don't give men much substantive advice on romantic pursuit, and this makes a lot of sense because even posting this brings up in me anxieties with the way women and their opinions can be persecuted or dismissed.

even regardless of gender, it is far too often that the attempted communication of people in one identity group falls fruitless, particularly as the those responding in the other group fail to leave the context of their own group (here, gender), which surrounds and creates their very perspectives, to then understand and empathize with the view of the other group in the latter's own and separate context.

as such, the men reading this might get incensed at small nothings and react defensively at how these descriptions might relate to them, without even understanding how these sit in the context of the woman's perspective, and how even to vicariously grasp the female experience of reality.

nothing here is personal. if you are rejected, it's not completely a problem with you. it is the result of the combination of everything making up that scenario.

for example, i was obsessed with the first man i dated the time when i dated him. but, if i had met him more recently, i would not have been attracted to him at all. he was kind and a good person, but that does not matter or shift my judgement because time changes people, and as i change so too does what i like.

additionally, i sometimes find myself attracted to someone i had never been attracted to, maybe who i had even rejected a few times. it always changes. give yourself the freedom to receive the love meant for you and to not force what doesn't come at the given time.

again, don't take this post so personally.

it should not destroy your identity to switch up a very general form of approaching another individual. if it does or if something is triggered in you, it could be helpful to seek a mental health professional and try to identify what it is that is hurt so that you may better understand yourself. if you want to show someone who you really are, its important that who you are is something that you, first, have grasped and made effort to understand.

dr. K's videos (healthygamerGG on youtube) are helpful for any sort of human interaction and will aid you wonderfully in seeking deep connection in this form of a romantic relationship. deep connections can also inspire individuals to pursue romance with each other. beautiful, real connection is always (in the moments it occupies) good and beautiful, no matter what becomes of it later.

remember,

what is meant for you will find you, and each door will open once you are the version of yourself meant (and prepared, by your life) to enter it.

it does not personally benefit me to give you any of this advice, but i'd like to see you all succeed in your romantic pursuits and find love, knowing at least a little of something before going into a relationship, where you will naturally learn the rest of everything you need to know. love can be a really beautiful thing.

cheers, good luck.

1kvpxwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalSEOandAI/comments/1kvpxwq/voice_search_seo_how_ai_is_shaping_the_future_of/,Voice Search SEO: How AI is Shaping the Future of Search,"How people search the internet is evolving rapidly. People do not just type questions into a search box as they once did. 

Many people use voice assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa to get fast answers now. This transformation is modifying website optimization for search engines. 

Using just keywords is no longer enough; AI and voice search SEO are important now.

Since smart devices and AI are becoming more popular, businesses should update their SEO plans to be seen online. 

We’re going to look at how AI is influencing voice search SEO and explain how you can use AI to help your SEO efforts.

# The Role of AI in Voice Search Optimization

Making voice search easy and effective is largely thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI). A person using traditional search might type “weather New York,” but with voice search they say “What is the weather in New York today?”

To handle these spoken-word sentences, search engines count on NLP, ML and voice recognition technologies based on AI. With these technologies, search engines can figure out what a person is looking for, regardless of how the query is spoken.

AI improves the accuracy of results given by search engines. It looks at how users behave, what searches they have done and the situation to improve both their experience and the results’ accuracy.



# The Rise of Voice Search

It’s quick, you don’t need your hands and it’s easy to use, so voice search is becoming popular. As we use smart speakers, mobile phones and home assistants more often, people are doing more voice searches.

Some surprising facts are listed below:

* Google reports that 27% of people across the world are using voice search on their mobile phones.
* By 2020, ComScore’s report said, half of all searches would be with voice.
* Ownership of smart speakers is rising every year, mainly in the U.S., U.K. and India.

Voice search is commonly used for fast, instant questions that people have while being active.

“How close is the nearest coffee shop?”

“Listen to soothing music.”

“When will Target close its doors today?”

That’s why local companies, content producers and online stores should concentrate on voice search SEO to be competitive.

# How AI Powers Enhance Voice Search Tools

All voice assistants rely on a solid AI system to make them work. These tools have the ability to work with many languages, different accents, sentence forms and even expressions of emotion from users. This is where AI comes in to make it all happen:

# Natural Language Processing.

The use of NLP allows devices to process and answer questions that people ask. It separates sentences into parts, finds the main subjects and finds out what the words mean. Voice search depends on this to show the best results.

# Contextual Understanding

AI doesn’t stop at words; it examines the context as well. If someone types, “What’s the weather today?”, the system understands to provide the weather for that day and that place.

# Speech Recognition

Voice recognition tools such as[ Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/) and Apple Siri rely on deep learning to change speech into written text and they now work well even in noisy areas or when someone speaks with an unusual accent.

#  Personalization

AI uses information from past behavior to give you custom answers. If you frequently search for vegan recipes, your assistant will probably show you vegan options first.

# Optimizing for Voice Search SEO

Voice search SEO is not identical to how we do regular SEO. Since people talk differently than they write online, search engine optimization should be adapted. To help you, try these suggestions.



# Make use of Conversation Keywords.

Natural speech is often how people make voice searches. The most common way to put this is by asking, “Which are the best places to stay in New York City?” Put long-tail questions in your content to help with search engine rankings.

# Respond to questions without any confusion.

Most of the time, people use voice search by asking a question. Place Q&A or an FAQ section on the pages of your site. It’s best to give an answer in 30–50 words, as voice assistants tend to display short answers for featured snippets.

# Pay attention to Local SEO.

Many people talk to their phones for local reasons, for example “show me coffee shops near me.” Always update your Google Business Profile and add information that is relevant to your area.

# Ensure your website is designed for mobile devices and is fast.

Most of the time, people make voice searches using their mobile devices. Making your website mobile-friendly and quick to load will help your users.



# Add Structured Data to your website.

Schema markup helps search engines read and understand your content well which can result in showing up in rich results or voice-based answers.

# Best AI Tools for Voice Search SEO

Several AI-powered tools can help optimize your content for voice search. Here are some top picks:

# AnswerThePublic

It visualizes questions people ask based on a keyword. This helps you create content that directly answers voice search queries.

# Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool

Finds long-tail keywords and questions your audience is asking—perfect for voice SEO.

# [**Frase.io**](http://Frase.io)

This tool uses AI to create content optimized for featured snippets and voice search by analyzing what’s ranking and how.

#  Moz Local

Helps manage and improve your local listings across directories, essential for voice search visibility in “near me” queries.

# Google Search Console + Google’s NLP API

Use these to understand how your content is interpreted by search engines and improve accordingly.



# The Future of AI & Voice Search SEO

The partnership between AI and voice search is only expected to grow. Thanks to Generative AI, future voice assistants may respond to questions as usual, but they’ll also be able to carry on conversations, produce content or manage tasks such as booking a trip or sending an email for us.

The following years are predicted to bring the following changes.

**Smart Voice Assistants**

 In the future, assistants could use AI models like ChatGPT to answer questions in depth.

# Multilingual Support

 AI is increasing the translations for voice search, now supporting different languages and dialects.

# Voice Commerce

People are expected to use voice search more for acquiring things they buy often and affordably.

# Another way to look at this is visual voice search.

In the near future, AI could combine voice with understanding what’s on your screen to help you buy or look for more information.

Businesses and creators need to make changes right away. Voice search is not a passing fad; it’s the way we’ll search in the future.

**Conclusion**

Because of AI, voice search SEO is transforming how users connect with the internet. It provides speedier, smarter and customized searches mainly for people using mobile and smart devices.

Businesses need to start adapting their content to meet the needs of people who query using speech rather than typing. For this, write like people speak and ask questions, strengthen local SEO efforts using AI and also adopt AI into your work. URLs that are adapted at the start will perform better, be noticed by users and receive a greater level of customer interest.

In short, AI and voice search are not just shaping the future of search—they are defining it. If you want your business to grow in this new era, now is the time to act.

Hi all,

For context I’m 6ft (183cm) and around 85kg (187lbs), with a goal weight of 75kg (165lbs). I’ve been carnivore on and off for a few years- currently on a 3 month strict streak. 

I was doing fantastically well tracking calories and eating to a 2:1 fat:protein ratio. I went down from 90kg to 84.5kg in around 6 weeks and felt great from the high fat. I did however get sick of eating so much damn butter and also sick of tracking my macros, so I switched it up. (I was eating 500g of 80/20 ground beef per day with 120g or so of butter).

I decided that I wanted to just eat to my satiety, twice a day. I started this 4 days ago at 84.5kg, and now I’m 86.2kg. I’ve been eating 1kg/2.2lbs of 80/20 ground beef (mince) per day, with 6 eggs. A couple tbs of heavy cream in my coffee (same as before). Adding up the calories on that it comes to over 3,000 - whereas on the high fat carnivore I was tracking around 2,000 - 2,200.

My point is that “just eat to satiety” simply doesn’t work for many people. I’ve got a history of binge eating and probably still push myself too far when eating. Tracking macros allows me to stay on track and not over consume. 

I appreciate I’m not super heavy and my weight loss will be slow for these last 20lbs. But it is very clear that the path I’m now on is a dangerous one in terms of gaining weight.

Looks like I’m going back to tracking…",0,1748250599.0,carnivorediet,44,0.43,False

I've been lucky enough to travel and stay in Paris 6 different times, with my first trip with my high school French club in 1985

A few of our favorite places changed ownership since our last visit but we discovered some new places and ate very well

Stayed in the 11 arr again and absolutely loved the atmosphere and day to day life. Almost everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming wherever we went despite our French deteriorating into random jumbles of words over the past 30 years. 

Not sure if it was the Olympics and Rugby WC but the city seemed much cleaner and well looked after. Street sweepers almost everywhere at night

Highlights

Early Bird coffee in the MARCHÉ BEAUVAU
PLACE D'ALIGRE

Seeing Notre Dame after the fire. What an incredible difference. Bright and airy now. Feels more like Sagrada Familia inside that the heavy, imposing Gothic feeling it had before

Evening picnics and strolls along the Seine. 3 nights of really nice weather out of 5. Saw some great jam sessions along the walk. 

Looking for Space Invaders with the app. We had way too much fun with this. Probably added an additional 25 km walking to the trip

Boeuf borginioeun at the Cafe Musées. Definitely lived up to the hype

Metro Navigo tap with Apple wallet. What a difference than trying to deal with those little paper tickets. Only issue was you could only buy individual tickets or passes in the Wallet app. Wish you could buy the 10 ticket option in it which you can if you go to the immobile app

For the life of me I will never understand the concept of 'bad attitude' in Paris. Almost everyone was Ireland level friendly with us.

In this celestial deep dive, we’ll explore each Darakaraka—the planet with the lowest degree in your birth chart (Vedic astrology style)—to understand who you’re karmically attracted to and what kind of day job they might have while changing your life. 

Because let’s be real: spiritual growth is cute, but knowing whether they’re a lawyer or a landscape artist is the real tea.

---

1. Sun as Darakaraka

Theme: Charisma, confidence, status

You’re drawn to people with leadership energy. They might be the boss, or they might just act like one.

You attract:

High-achieving, commanding personalities

People with a glow that says “I know things you don’t”

Possibly egotistical—but at least they moisturize


Possible Occupations:

CEOs, government officials, politicians

Motivational speakers, influencers

Judges, diplomats, or that one guy who always gets promoted


Your lesson: Not everything is about power. Sometimes love means taking off the crown… or letting someone else wear it.


---

2. Moon as Darakaraka

Theme: Emotions, nurturing, intuition

You love softies, caretakers, and those who sense your vibes before you text them.

You attract:

Emotionally intelligent (or deeply emotional) people

Sensitive souls who remember your coffee order and your childhood trauma


Possible Occupations:

Nurses, psychologists, counselors

Writers, chefs, teachers of tiny humans

Sleepy-eyed poets who cry during animated films


Your lesson: Don’t confuse comfort with co-dependency. You’re dating a partner, not a plushie.


---

3. Mars as Darakaraka

Theme: Action, intensity, physicality

Love is war (or at least a sweaty boxing match) when Mars calls the shots.

You attract:

Energetic, athletic, fiery people

Lovers who text “u up?” and then show up in 7 minutes


Possible Occupations:

Soldiers, athletes, firefighters

Surgeons, police officers, mechanics

That person who “accidentally” challenges the waiter to arm wrestling


Your lesson: Channel passion constructively. Not everything needs to be a dramatic monologue and a sprint.


---

4. Mercury as Darakaraka

Theme: Wit, communication, curiosity

Your heart beats for brainy chatterboxes with chaotic Google search histories.

You attract:

Thinkers, speakers, tweeters

People who say “fun fact” and never stop talking


Possible Occupations:

Writers, journalists, comedians

Coders, marketers, translators

That person who explains memes like it’s a TED Talk


Your lesson: Love isn’t a debate or a trivia contest. But feel free to flirt with footnotes.


---

5. Jupiter as Darakaraka

Theme: Wisdom, growth, spirituality

Your ideal partner might wear glasses and speak in parables. Or at least pretend to be enlightened.

You attract:

Teachers, mentors, life advice givers (uninvited or not)

People who quote Rumi in everyday conversation


Possible Occupations:

Professors, philosophers, spiritual leaders

Lawyers, judges, financial advisors

Life coaches with “abundance” tattoos


Your lesson: You don’t have to worship your partner’s wisdom. Sometimes your intuition is smarter than their PhD.


---

6. Venus as Darakaraka

Theme: Romance, pleasure, aesthetics

Love is a vibe, a mood, and maybe a slow-motion hair flip.

You attract:

Attractive, artistic, sensual partners

People who light candles before casual dinner and have skincare routines longer than yours


Possible Occupations:

Artists, fashion designers, models

Interior decorators, dancers, musicians

Instagram content creators who sigh a lot and wear silk robes


Your lesson: True love isn’t always pretty. Sometimes it’s messy and makeup-free—and that’s okay.


---

7. Saturn as Darakaraka

Theme: Discipline, longevity, reality checks

You attract the grown-ups. They’re either older, more responsible, or just 22-year-olds with a pension plan.

You attract:

Reserved, stable, possibly emotionally aloof types

People who read manuals for fun and file taxes early


Possible Occupations:

Engineers, architects, accountants

Government workers, lawyers, construction managers

Anyone who wears beige by choice and loves a spreadsheet


Your lesson: Love isn’t always fun and flirty. Sometimes it’s slow, serious, and built to last. (With emotional scaffolding.)


---

8. Rahu as Darakaraka (for advanced karma students)

Theme: Obsession, rebellion, fascination

When Rahu’s in charge, you fall for the rule-breakers, rebels, or people who ghost you spiritually.

You attract:

Mysterious, edgy, or foreign partners

People with secret pasts, 5 passports, and an occult book collection


Possible Occupations:

Filmmakers, hackers, underground artists

Crypto traders, cult leaders, illusionists

That guy you met at a full moon rave who says he's “beyond labels”


Your lesson: What’s thrilling isn’t always right. Karmic doesn’t mean forever—sometimes it means lesson learned, now run.


---

Conclusion: Your Cosmic HR Department Is Wild

Your Darakaraka doesn’t just point to your soulmate—it points to your karmic classroom. 

Whether you’re paired with a philosopher, a firefighter, or a poet who sells essential oils, the lesson is always personal.

So take it with humor. Maybe love isn’t meant to be perfect—just perfectly fated for your growth.

And if you keep attracting the same mess?

Check your chart. Then your Darakaraka.

Then maybe your taste.

1kvptn4,https://youtu.be/rtoPDBR8FIA,3 Very Scary TRUE House Next Door Horror Stories,"**""Digging at Night"":**

I’d just moved into my new house, a small two-bedroom place in a quiet suburban neighborhood. The street was peaceful, with neat lawns and kids’ bikes scattered around. My next-door neighbor, John, lived in a similar house with his wife, Emily, and their six-year-old daughter, Lily. The first day I moved in, they came over with a plate of homemade chocolate chip cookies. Emily was warm, her smile bright as she handed me the plate. “Thought you might like these to settle in,” she said, brushing a strand of brown hair from her face. Lily clung to her leg, clutching a pink stuffed bunny, her big eyes curious but shy. John stood behind them, tall and muscular, maybe late thirties, with a short beard. “Nice to have you here,” he said, his voice flat, his eyes lingering on me a little too long. I smiled back, but his stare made my skin prickle. I told myself it was just new-neighbor nerves.The first few weeks were uneventful. I’d see Emily in her garden, kneeling in the dirt, planting flowers, or Lily riding her tricycle in their driveway, the bunny strapped to the handlebars. John was around less, but when I saw him, he’d wave, though his face stayed serious, almost guarded. One afternoon, I bumped into him at the mailbox. “Settling in okay?” he asked, his eyes scanning me slowly. “Yeah, it’s great,” I said, trying to sound cheerful. “Quiet street.” He nodded, then said, “Keep it that way.” His tone was odd, like a warning, but he walked away before I could respond. I stood there, clutching my mail, feeling uneasy.A month in, I noticed I hadn’t seen Emily or Lily for days. Their yard was empty, no tricycle, no gardening tools. I figured they were busy, maybe on a trip. But one evening, I saw John dragging a heavy black trash bag to the curb. It looked lumpy, awkward to carry. I waved from my porch, trying to be neighborly. “Hey, haven’t seen Emily or Lily lately. Everything okay?” I asked. He froze for a second, then turned, his eyes narrow. “They’re visiting family,” he said, his voice too smooth, like he’d practiced it. “They’ll be back soon.” I nodded, but something felt off. Their Jeep was still in the garage, its tires covered in dust. And I could’ve sworn I’d heard shouting from their house the night before—Emily’s voice, sharp and panicked, then silence.That night, I couldn’t sleep. Around 2 a.m., I heard noises from John’s backyard—soft, rhythmic thuds, like a shovel hitting dirt. I crept to my bedroom window, heart pounding, and peeked through the blinds. In the faint moonlight, I saw John, hunched over, digging near his shed. The pile of dirt beside him grew larger with each scoop. My stomach churned. Why was he digging in the middle of the night? I tried to rationalize it—maybe he was planting something, fixing a pipe—but the image stuck with me, chilling me to the bone.The next morning, I saw him at the curb again, hauling another trash bag. This one had something poking out—a flash of pink fabric. My breath caught. It was Lily’s stuffed bunny, the one she never let go of. My hands shook as I grabbed my phone and called my friend, Jen. “I’m freaking out,” I said, pacing my kitchen. “My neighbor’s acting so weird. Emily and Lily are gone, and I saw him digging last night. And now Lily’s toy is in his trash.” Jen’s voice was calm but serious. “That sounds bad. Maybe he’s just cleaning out stuff, but… keep an eye on him. And be careful.” She suggested I write down what I saw, just in case. “If it gets worse, call the police,” she added. I wasn’t ready for that, but I started keeping a notebook—dates, times, everything strange.A week later, a foul smell started coming from John’s house. It wasn’t just garbage—it was thick, rancid, like rotting meat. It hit me every time I stepped outside, making my eyes water. I’d hold my breath when I passed his driveway. One day, I couldn’t take it anymore and knocked on his door. He answered, wearing a stained t-shirt, his face blank. “Hey, everything okay? There’s a weird smell coming from your place,” I said, trying to sound casual. He stared at me, his jaw tight. “Just some old trash,” he said. “I’ll handle it.” But his eyes were cold, almost daring me to push further. I mumbled an okay and left, my heart racing. The smell didn’t go away—it got worse.Then the police showed up. I was washing dishes when I saw two officers knock on John’s door. He stepped outside, arms crossed, looking tense. I cracked my window to listen. “We’re investigating the disappearance of Emily and Lily Smith,” one officer said, holding a notepad. “When did you last see them?” John’s voice was low, but I caught, “They’re with family. Out of town.” The officers pressed him, asking for details, but he kept his answers short. They left after a few minutes, but I saw them glance at the backyard, then at each other. My stomach twisted. Disappearance? I thought of the digging, the bunny, the smell.That night, the thudding started again. I grabbed my phone and added it to my notes: “2:17 a.m., digging sounds from John’s backyard.” I couldn’t stand it anymore. I needed answers. The next evening, I waited until it was dark and crept to the edge of my yard, hiding behind my fence. My heart pounded so loud I thought he’d hear it. Through the slats, I saw fresh dirt piled near his shed, a tarp half-covering it. A shovel leaned against the wall. My mind raced. Was that a grave? Before I could move, footsteps crunched behind me. “Hey,” John’s voice hissed. I spun around, my breath catching. He was at the fence, his face shadowed but his eyes glinting. “I saw you in my backyard earlier. Snooping.” His voice was low, threatening. “You never know what you might find, poking around like that.” I stammered, “I—I wasn’t, I just heard something.” He stepped closer, the fence between us. “Stay out of my business,” he said, then turned and walked back to his house. I ran inside, locking every door, my hands trembling.I called Jen again, my voice shaking. “He caught me watching him,” I said. “He knows I’m suspicious. I’m scared, Jen.” She was quiet for a moment, then said, “You need to call the police. This isn’t just weird anymore—it’s dangerous.” I didn’t sleep that night, jumping at every sound. I kept my phone close, ready to dial 911. Over the next few days, I stayed inside, avoiding John. But I couldn’t stop watching his house. The smell was unbearable now, and I saw more trash bags piling up by his curb.Then, one morning, the street filled with police cars. Sirens wailed as officers swarmed John’s house. I watched from my porch, my heart in my throat, as they led him out in handcuffs. His face was blank, but his eyes locked on mine for a split second, sending a chill down my spine. A neighbor across the street, an older woman named Mrs. Carter, came over later, her voice trembling. “They found them,” she whispered. “Emily and Lily. Buried in his backyard.” I felt the world tilt. “What?” I managed to say. She nodded, tears in her eyes. “They’d been there for weeks. He… he killed them.”The police confirmed it later. John had murdered his wife and daughter, hiding their bodies in the yard he’d been digging up at night. The smell, the bunny, the arguments—it all clicked into place, a horrifying puzzle. I couldn’t stay in that house after that. Every time I looked out my window, I saw that pile of dirt, imagined Lily’s bunny in the trash, heard Emily’s voice from that night. I packed up and moved a month later, renting an apartment across town. But the fear stuck with me. I check my locks three times every night, wake up to every creak, and sometimes, in the dark, I still see John’s eyes, watching me, warning me to stay out of his business.





**""The Copycat"":**

I never imagined that moving to a quiet street in Willow Creek, Ohio, would pull me into a nightmare. My husband, David, our five-year-old son, Alex, and I were overjoyed about our new home. It was a two-story house with a wide front porch and a big backyard where Alex could run around with his soccer ball. The neighborhood felt safe, with neatly trimmed lawns and kids riding bikes. We thought it was the perfect place to start fresh after years in a cramped city apartment. But then we met our neighbor, Janet, and everything I thought I knew about safety unraveled.It started on moving day. We were hauling boxes from the truck, sweat on our brows, when a woman crossed the lawn with a plate of chocolate chip cookies. She was in her late forties, with short brown hair and a smile that seemed too eager. “Welcome to the neighborhood!” she said, handing me the plate. “I’m Janet, from next door. My daughter’s off at college, so it’s just me now.” Her voice was warm, but her eyes lingered on me, scanning my face like she was memorizing it. I thanked her, introduced David and Alex, and promised to have her over for coffee once we settled in. She seemed nice, just lonely, I thought.Over the next few weeks, Janet became a constant presence. She’d knock on our door at odd times—early morning, late evening—asking to borrow a cup of flour or offering tips on pruning roses. I’d find her standing on our porch, peering through the window if I didn’t answer right away. One afternoon, while I was hanging Alex’s tiny shirts on the backyard clothesline, I felt eyes on me. I looked up and saw Janet at her kitchen window, staring. Not casually glancing—staring, her hands still in the sink, unmoving. When she saw me notice, she didn’t flinch. She just waved, her smile stretching wide. My stomach twisted, but I waved back, forcing a smile. Maybe she was just curious, I told myself.Things got stranger. I bought a blue sundress for a friend’s barbecue, feeling good in it for the first time in a while. A week later, Janet showed up at our door wearing the exact same dress. “Oh, what a funny coincidence!” she said when I pointed it out, laughing too loudly. But her eyes didn’t laugh—they watched me, sharp and unblinking. Then I noticed she’d started styling her hair like mine, pulling it into a loose bun I often wore. She even picked up my phrases, like when she said, “Bless his little heart,” about Alex after he showed her his toy truck. It was my phrase, one I’d used a dozen times. It felt like she was trying to slip into my skin.One night, as I chopped carrots for dinner, David came home looking uneasy. “Some neighbors stopped me today,” he said, loosening his tie. “They asked if everything’s okay with Alex. Said they heard you’ve been leaving him alone for hours while you’re out.”I dropped the knife, my heart racing. “What? I’m always home with him, or he’s with a sitter. Who said that?”“I don’t know,” he said, frowning. “They heard it from someone. It’s just talk.”But it wasn’t just talk. A few days later, I opened the door to a woman in a gray blazer, holding a clipboard. “I’m from child services,” she said. “We received a report about possible neglect of your son.” My knees went weak. I invited her in, my hands shaking as I showed her Alex’s room, his toys, his schedule. I explained that I never left him alone. She was kind but thorough, checking our fridge, asking Alex gentle questions. After an hour, she said there was no evidence of neglect and left. But the visit left me rattled, humiliated. Neighbors’ eyes followed me when I walked Alex to the park, their whispers like needles. I knew it was Janet. Who else could it be?I couldn’t let it go. The next day, I marched to her house, my pulse pounding in my ears. When she opened the door, her face lit up. “Oh, hi! Want some tea?” she chirped, like nothing was wrong.“Janet, did you call child services on me?” I asked, keeping my voice steady.Her smile vanished. Her eyes widened, then filled with tears. “How could you think that?” she gasped, clutching her chest. “I thought we were friends! I’d never hurt you like that!” Her voice rose, loud enough for anyone nearby to hear. A neighbor across the street glanced over, pausing her gardening. I mumbled an apology and left, but as I walked away, I felt her staring, her tears gone too quickly.That night, I sat David down at the kitchen table. “She’s watching me,” I said, my voice trembling. “She’s copying me, spreading lies. I think she’s the one who called child services.”He rubbed his temples. “She’s probably just lonely. Maybe a bit odd, but dangerous? I don’t know. Let’s just keep our distance.”“I’m trying,” I said, “but she won’t stop.”Keeping our distance didn’t work. Janet’s visits grew more insistent. She’d bring cookies or little toys for Alex—a plastic dinosaur, a shiny robot—even after I asked her to stop. One day, I came home from the grocery store and found Alex in the living room, playing with a new remote-control car. “Where’d you get that?” I asked, my voice sharp.“Aunt Janet gave it to me,” he said, beaming as he steered the car across the rug.I froze. Aunt Janet? I’d never called her that. My hands shook as I took the toy away, telling Alex we’d talk later. I marched to Janet’s house, the car in my hand. “I told you not to give him gifts,” I said when she answered the door.Her face softened, but her eyes were cold. “I’m just trying to be nice,” she said. “He’s such a sweet boy. Don’t you want him to be happy?”“This stops now,” I said, turning away before she could reply. But her gaze burned into my back.The fear grew heavier. One night, as I tucked Alex into bed, I heard a soft rustling outside, like footsteps on gravel. I crept to the window, my heart in my throat, and peeked through the curtains. A shadow stood in our backyard, near the swing set, staring up at my bedroom window. I couldn’t see a face, but the shape was unmistakable—Janet’s short, stocky frame. My breath caught, and I yanked the curtains shut. When I looked again, the figure was gone. I told David, my voice shaking. “There was someone out there, watching us.”He frowned, checking the window himself. “It’s dark. Maybe it was a neighbor’s dog or something. You’re stressed, hon.”“It wasn’t a dog,” I snapped. “It was her.”The next week, I came home to find our house… wrong. The kitchen chairs were pushed against the wall, not where I’d left them. A picture frame on the living room mantle—a photo of Alex’s first birthday—was tilted just slightly. A drawer in my bedroom was open an inch, my scarves rearranged. Nothing was stolen, but someone had been inside. I called David at work, my voice barely steady. “Someone’s been in our house.”“Are you sure?” he asked. “Maybe Alex was playing around.”“He’s five, David. He doesn’t rearrange furniture or touch my scarves.”I bought new locks for the doors and started checking every window before bed. I stopped letting Alex play outside alone, even in our fenced backyard. The feeling of being watched never left. I’d catch glimpses of Janet’s silhouette in her window, her head tilted toward our house. At night, I’d lie awake, listening for footsteps, my heart racing at every creak.Then came the worst. One morning, two police officers knocked on our door. “We have a report that you attempted to run over your neighbor, Janet, with your car,” one said, his face stern.I stared, my mouth dry. “That’s insane. I didn’t do that. I wasn’t even on her street yesterday.”Janet claimed I’d swerved at her while she was walking, nearly hitting her. The police didn’t arrest me, but they charged me with attempted assault. The next few months were a blur of panic and paperwork. We hired a lawyer, draining our savings with every bill. Neighbors stopped talking to us, their eyes cold when I passed. I felt like I was drowning. At night, I’d dream of Janet’s face, her smile twisting into something cruel.In court, things finally turned. A woman from Janet’s old neighborhood testified, her voice steady. “She did this to me too,” she said. “Accused me of stealing, called the police, spread lies until we moved.” Then, a miracle: security footage from a house down the street showed Janet walking alone, no car in sight, at the time she claimed I’d tried to hit her. My lawyer presented the evidence, and the judge dropped the charges. I nearly collapsed with relief, but the fear lingered.We moved three months later, to a small town hours away. Packing our life into boxes felt like escaping a cage. Our new house is quiet, the neighbors distant but kind. But even now, I can’t shake Janet’s shadow. I check the locks three times before bed. I wake up at night, heart pounding, certain I hear footsteps outside. Sometimes, I think I see her face in a crowd—at the grocery store, in a passing car—and my breath stops. I don’t know if she’ll ever find us, but I’ll never forget how she watched me, how she tried to unravel my life, piece by piece, until I wasn’t sure who I was anymore.





**""Behind the Fence"":**

I lived in a quiet neighborhood in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in a small brick house with a neatly trimmed lawn and a creaky front porch. Next door were John and Tanisha, a couple who seemed to have it all together when I first moved in. They had two kids, a boy about eight and a girl around five, who’d chase each other in their backyard, laughing and kicking a soccer ball. John was the outgoing type, always waving from his driveway, cracking jokes about the local football team. Tanisha was softer, with a warm smile that made you feel like you’d known her forever. We’d chat over the low wooden fence sometimes, about the kids’ school events or where to get the best pizza in town. They invited me over for a barbecue once, and we sat in their backyard, eating burgers and watching the kids play tag. Everything seemed perfect. But over time, little things started to feel wrong, like a knot tightening in my stomach.It began with small moments. Tanisha started looking tired, her eyes red and puffy like she hadn’t slept in days. One afternoon, I saw her in their driveway, unloading groceries from their blue minivan. A bag slipped from her hands, and apples rolled across the pavement. I jogged over to help, picking up a few before they rolled into the street.“You okay?” I asked, handing her an apple.She forced a smile, but it was thin, like it took effort. “Yeah, just clumsy. Thanks for helping.”I noticed a bandage on her hand, a fresh cut peeking out from the edge, red and raw. “What happened there?”“Oh, just cut myself chopping vegetables,” she said, tugging her sleeve down. “No big deal.”She grabbed the last bag and hurried inside, her steps quick, like she didn’t want to talk anymore. I stood there, holding an apple, feeling uneasy but not sure why. Couples have rough patches, I told myself. None of my business.But then I started hearing things at night. Muffled voices came through the thin walls between our houses, sharp and angry. I’d lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to make out words but only catching the tone—John’s voice loud, Tanisha’s quieter, sometimes pleading. One night, I heard a crash, like something heavy hit the floor. My heart jumped, and I sat up, listening. Silence followed, heavy and thick. I thought about knocking on their door, but what would I say? The next morning, I saw Tanisha in her backyard, hanging laundry on a clothesline. She moved slowly, like every step hurt, her face pale and her eyes fixed on the ground.“Hey, everything alright?” I called over the fence, trying to sound casual.She flinched, then looked up, forcing that same thin smile. “Yeah, we’re fine. Just a long night. Kids kept us up.”Her voice was flat, and she didn’t meet my eyes for long. I noticed a bruise on her arm, half-hidden by her sleeve, purple and splotchy. “You sure? You seem a little off.”“I’m fine,” she said, sharper this time. “Just busy. Thanks for checking.”She turned back to the clothesline, pinning up a small shirt with shaking hands. I wanted to say more, but John stepped out onto their back porch, a coffee mug in his hand. He waved, all smiles, like nothing was wrong.“Hey, neighbor!” he called. “You coming to the block party next week?”“Uh, maybe,” I said, caught off guard. “Still figuring out my plans.”“Gotta get you out there,” he said, grinning. But his eyes were hard, watching me too closely. I nodded and went back inside, feeling his gaze on my back.The nights got worse. The arguments grew louder, more frequent. One evening, I was in my kitchen, washing dishes, when I heard Tanisha’s voice, high and panicked. “Please, John, just stop!” she said, clear as day through the open window. Then a thud, like something—or someone—hit a wall. I froze, soap dripping from my hands. My phone was on the counter, and I thought about calling someone, but who? What if I was overreacting? I dried my hands and stood by the window, listening, but it was quiet again. Too quiet.The next day, I saw John in his garage, sharpening a kitchen knife on a whetstone. The sound—scrape, scrape, scrape—made my skin crawl. He looked up and saw me watching from my driveway.“Just getting this ready for dinner,” he said, holding up the knife, the blade catching the light. “Gotta make sure it’s sharp.”“Yeah, looks sharp enough,” I said, forcing a laugh. My stomach twisted as I walked away, picturing that knife in his hand.I started noticing other things. Tanisha stopped coming outside as much. The kids, who used to be so loud and playful, stayed in their rooms more, their laughter gone. Once, I saw the little girl sitting on their front steps, hugging her knees, looking lost. I waved, but she just stared, then ran inside. I told myself I was imagining things, that every family has problems. But the knot in my stomach wouldn’t go away.One night, it all fell apart. I was watching TV, the volume low, when a scream cut through the air. It was Tanisha, her voice raw and terrified. “No, John, please!” Another scream, then a horrible, wet thud. I jumped up, my heart pounding so hard I could barely think. I grabbed my phone and ran to my front door, stepping onto the porch. Their house was dark except for a faint light in the living room. I heard another cry, weaker this time, and then nothing.I dialed 911, my hands shaking. “Something’s wrong at my neighbor’s house,” I said, my voice barely steady. “I heard screams. Please hurry.”“Stay where you are,” the operator said. “Officers are on the way.”I couldn’t just stand there. I ran across the lawn to their front door and knocked, hard. “Tanisha? John? You okay?” No answer. I tried the handle, but it was locked. I pounded again, my knuckles stinging. “Tanisha, open the door!”Through the small window beside the door, I saw movement—a shadow stumbling, then falling. My breath caught. I ran around to the back, thinking I could get in through the patio. The glass door was cracked open, and I pushed it wide, stepping into their kitchen. The smell hit me first—something metallic and sharp. Then I saw her.Tanisha was on the floor, blood pooling under her, soaking into the rug. Her eyes were open, staring at nothing. A knife lay beside her, the same one John had been sharpening. I dropped to my knees, my hands hovering over her, not knowing what to do. “Tanisha,” I whispered, my voice breaking. She didn’t move.I heard sirens in the distance, getting closer. I stumbled back outside, my legs weak, and saw John’s truck peel out of the driveway, tires screeching. The police arrived minutes later, their lights flashing red and blue across the street. I told them what I’d seen, my words tripping over each other. They went inside, and one officer came out, his face grim.“She’s gone,” he said. “We’ll find him.”They didn’t have to look far. Later that night, I learned John had driven his truck into an oncoming semi on the highway outside town. He didn’t survive. The kids were with their grandparents, safe but orphaned. The police said it was domestic violence, that John had been hurting Tanisha for years, and no one knew how bad it was until it was too late.I couldn’t sleep for weeks. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Tanisha’s face, her empty stare. I kept thinking about the signs—the bruises, the arguments, the way she’d pull away when I asked if she was okay. How could I not see what was happening right next door? I thought they were just a normal couple, maybe going through a rough patch. But it was so much worse.The house next door is empty now. The kids’ toys are gone, the yard overgrown. Sometimes, I sit on my porch and stare at their front door, wondering what I could’ve done differently. I should’ve asked more questions, pushed harder when Tanisha brushed me off. Maybe if I had, she’d still be here. The neighborhood is still quiet, but it’s not peaceful anymore. It’s the kind of quiet that hides things, the kind that makes you wonder what’s happening behind other closed doors.",1,1748250193.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1kvptj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1kvptj2/personalitypsychological_effects_of_certain_meds/,Personality/psychological effects of certain meds?,"I realize this isn't a post about any of the ""hardcore"" aspects of epilepsy and seizures. I've had epilepsy for 5 years. Started out of nowhere in my late 50's. I DID have bacterial meningitis at a year old, my mom said I almost died. Did this cause it? Doesn't matter. Temporal lobe. 3 grand mals. Then Lamictal. Got focal seizures after that. Added Divalproex. Then added Oxcarbazepine. No seizures for a year. Added Klonopin. No seizures yet. Almost 2 years. We both (doc and I) thought the Oxcarbazepine wasn't doing anything so I got off it 6 months ago and nothing happened. The Divalproex was making me trip and fall a lot so I'm only taking 250 mg once a day now. 3 months, no seizures. So the Klonopin seems to be good for me. He's thinking of taking me off Divalproex  completely in a few months if all goes well. 
So all that blathering above was to ask if anyone can report personality changes from:

Lamictal,
Divalproex or
Klonopin

My husband says the 500mg dose of the Divalproex caused me to slurr my words a little bit. I also knocked things off the counter easily or dropped things easily like cups of coffee.  And find like the ketchup bottle in the spice cabinet, things like that.

But my real question is that my mom said my personality has changed. She said when we talk on the phone I always talk about myself and I never used to be that way. Also I talk on on and on more than I used to. Does anyone experience that or other personality changes from the three medications above? 

Thanks for listening, all

1kvpov8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kvpov8/datingmess/,DatingMess,"I was seeing this girl I met in a university class. We started off casually—getting coffee and doing homework together. About two months in, I asked her out on a proper date to show that I was interested in more than just friendship. She said she wasn’t ready, and I respected that. I told her we should just focus on finishing the course, and that I appreciated her honesty.

After that, she started showing more interest—she’d come over to my place to study, bring food, and generally seemed to enjoy my company. A few days before our course ended, she started asking me to go for lunch. She asked several times, and I didn’t respond until the sixth time, when I finally said yes. We went out, had a great time, and seemed to really connect. She still framed it as ""lunch,"" but it was after 5 p.m., so for me it felt more like a dinner date.

Then we both went on vacation. While we were apart, she started texting more, and we got closer emotionally. In one conversation, she said things like “promise to take care of me,” and I joked that she was my girlfriend now. She didn’t object—we talked like a couple, spent time together, and it felt mutual. But about two weeks later, I felt her energy shift. Even though I was putting in all the effort, she pulled back and eventually said we weren’t actually a couple and that I had misunderstood. Still, she never said she loved me, but the way we acted and talked, it felt like we were together.

I said we should move on, but she insisted we stay connected and “explore things” without rushing, saying she didn’t want to make mistakes like she did with her ex, Harry.

Over the next year, we got as close as possible—daily video calls, constant support, going out. I did everything: helped with her homework, managed her mood swings, supported her through life struggles, planned dates, cooked, everything. Sure, we fought, but the fights would blow over quickly. I genuinely thought we were a great match.

Then she told me she was going to visit a guy in another city, along with some friends. I asked if it was a date—it led to another awkward conversation where she said, “We’re partners, but romantically, I’d fuck you up.” That’s when I told her we should stop seeing each other.

In that one year, I gave everything. I cooked for her, supported her emotionally, bought her flowers—only to hear things like “these are okay, but the last ones were dead,” or she’d rate my meals 5/10. Most of our fights happened when she was down, and I was just trying to help. Her constant ungratefulness eventually wore me down.

Did I do the right thing? I think I fell in love, but at some point you have to decide when to let go. I sacrificed so much—my grades, my career, my mental peace—for someone who didn’t seem to value any of it. When I asked her why she let things get so close if this was the outcome, she just said, “You shouldn’t have gotten attached.” Seriously?

So I thought I needed her to really reflect on her actions to understand how hurtful she is. So thought to do a mirror spell.

So on sat, I added a petition inside a pocket mirror with a blend of bend over oil mixed with devil shoestring oil and ground coffee, all of that inside a small mirror. Wrapped the whole thing inside a black bin bag then added aluminium foil around it and tucked in a dark place in my room.

My life runs on precision, order, and strategic acquisitions. As CEO of a major construction firm, I don't do chaos. So, when my best friend Jai, that selfless military doctor, asked me to look after his sister, Ana , while he's deployed, I agreed, out of loyalty. What I didn't sign up for was Jacqueline Melrose, Ana's roommate and the human embodiment of a glitter bomb exploding in my perfectly organized world. She's a feisty redhead who practically radiates trouble, constantly dragging Ana into situations that make my perfectly coiffed hair want to stand on end. She's loud, she's unpredictable, and she has this infuriating habit of enjoying annoying me. But my annoyance has just graduated to outright fury. I recently discovered that the very same Rose Melrose, the one who makes my blood pressure spike at every social gathering, is the brilliant, relentless attorney leading the civil rights lawsuit against my company regarding alleged violations in our community displacement and relocation program. She's a legitimate threat, a legal barracuda disguised as a party girl. Part of me is grudgingly impressed by her audacity and skill, but the rest of me just wants to throttle her. This isn't just annoying anymore; this is war.



Jacqueline ""Rose"" Melrose

My life's a whirlwind of late-night legal briefs, chaotic apartment living with my best friend and roommate Ana, and, let's be honest, a fair share of well-deserved trouble. So, when Ana's military doctor brother, Jai—who also happens to be Alexander Anton's best friend—asked that brooding, perfectionist control freak to ""look after"" Ana while he's deployed, I nearly choked on my coffee. Alex Anton, Mr. Grumpy-Billionaire-CEO, now our de facto babysitter? It's bad enough he pollutes our social circle with his perpetual scowl, but now he's everywhere. He gets twitchy every time Ana and I breathe, convinced I'm leading her astray. What he doesn't know, and what I certainly won't tell him, is that the ""trouble"" I get into sometimes is far more serious than a wild party. I'm taking down his precious empire, one precedent at a time. The look on his face when he finds out I'm the one spearheading the environmental justice litigation against his latest urban development project? Priceless. He might hate my guts, but I'm going to make him respect my brief.

Please bare with me as I don’t have a clue really.

So I’ve ordered the Dedica, and I’ve been doing some research, and apparently it’s best to have a bottomless portafilter (not too sure what that is lol) and a grinder? Apparently that’s the best way to get a coffee out of this. So I’m guessing the machine doesn’t grind the coffee beans? And that you have to put ground coffee in it? I’m in the UK so if anyone has any ground coffee suggestions that would be great! 

And eventually if I do get a bottomless portafilter and grinder, how do I find one that is compatible with this machine, and what grinder is good but not too expensive? And if I need anything else that I should buy with it too. I’ve even seen people weight their coffee beans and now I’m thinking this is so complicated for me lol!

We often take fresh air for granted. Yet, stepping outside for even a few minutes each day can offer significant benefits to our health and overall well-being. From boosting mental clarity to improving immune function, fresh air is one of the simplest and most natural remedies for a healthier lifestyle.

# How Fresh Air Benefits Your Body

It’s no surprise that fresh air feels good, but its effects on your physical health go beyond surface-level observations. Breathing in clean, oxygen-rich air can directly improve major body systems in powerful ways.

**Increased Oxygen Levels**

Fresh air is full of oxygen, a gas your body absolutely depends on to function. When you step outside, the influx of oxygen to your lungs helps:

* **Improve your circulation** by increasing the amount of oxygen that reaches your tissues and muscles. This can enhance physical performance and energy levels.

* **Boost brain function** by enhancing oxygen delivery to the brain. This can sharpen focus, improve memory, and even lift your mood. Research shows that exposure to higher levels of oxygen reduces instances of fatigue and brain fog.

**Better Respiratory Health**

Fresh air can serve as a detox for your lungs, especially when you compare outdoor air to the stale air trapped indoors. Ventilating your lungs helps:

* **Remove toxins** that accumulate in indoor environments, such as carbon dioxide and airborne pollutants.

* **Improve breathing efficiency** by encouraging full, deep breaths, which are harder to take in confined spaces. This is particularly beneficial for those with respiratory conditions like asthma.

**Enhanced Immune Support**

Believe it or not, stepping into nature can give your immune system a much-needed boost. Fresh air:

* **Reduces stress** by lowering levels of cortisol, a hormone that, when elevated, suppresses immune function.

* **Promotes vitamin D synthesis** when paired with sunlight exposure, a vital nutrient that supports your immune defenses.

# How Fresh Air Transforms Mental Health

While the physical advantages of fresh air are impressive, its effects on mental well-being are just as significant. Spending time outdoors can lead to noticeable improvements in focus, stress relief, and emotional resilience.

**Stress and Anxiety Reduction**

The outdoors has a calming presence. Simply stepping outside can release tension, thanks to:

* **Lower cortisol levels**, helping the brain and body relax.

* **Nature's natural rhythms**, like the sound of leaves rustling or birds chirping, creating an immediate sense of calm. Studies show that people who spend time in green environments report lower anxiety levels than those who don’t.

**Boosted Mood and Mental Clarity**

Breathing fresh air revitalizes the brain, increasing mental clarity and producing feel-good chemicals. This is because:

* **Oxygen plays a critical role** in serotonin production, the neurotransmitter linked with happiness and well-being.

* People who immerse themselves in outdoor settings often report greater emotional stability, lower levels of depression, and higher overall satisfaction with life.

**Improved Sleep Quality**

If nothing else, fresh air may help you sleep better. Exposure to natural environments during the day can:

* **Regulate your circadian rhythms**, syncing your internal clock with daylight cycles.

* Help your body release melatonin naturally, promoting deeper, more restful sleep.

# Simple Ways to Incorporate Fresh Air into Your Day

https://preview.redd.it/gyva3pkla33f1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=20f25508be085719d1bb57ca939cbd7324b27978

You don’t need to live in the countryside or take hours out of your schedule to reap the benefits of fresh air. Here are a few simple ways to integrate more time outdoors into your daily life:

1. **Morning walks** \- Start your day with a brief walk. The quiet morning air can awaken both body and mind.

1. **Work breaks outside** \- Spend your lunch or coffee break outside. A change of scenery can also improve productivity.

1. **Open windows** \- Can’t get outside? Open your windows for better ventilation and to bring the outdoors in.

1. **Exercise outdoors** \- Swap the treadmill for a jog through the park or do yoga in your backyard for an extra boost.

1. **Weekend adventures** \- Dedicate time to outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, or even visiting your local botanical garden.

# The Bigger Picture Fresh Air Brings

Fresh air isn’t just about personal health. It’s also tied to environmental mindfulness. The quality of the air we breathe impacts communities, ecosystems, and future generations.

When you make it a priority to get outdoors, consider how you can also protect air quality for everyone. Actions like reducing vehicle emissions, planting trees, and supporting clean energy initiatives can ensure that fresh air remains accessible for everyone.

# Start Breathing Better Today

The next time life feels overwhelming or you’re feeling sluggish, take a moment to step outside and breathe deeply. Fresh air has the power to uplift, energize, and heal in ways that are hard to replicate. Whether it’s a short walk, an open window, or a weekend spent in nature, prioritizing time outdoors is one small change that can have tremendous benefits.

Positivity in those moments might seem far away, like something only certain people are born with. But the truth is, positivity isn’t something you have or don’t have—it’s something you practice.

It starts with noticing.
A warm coffee in the morning.
A kind message.
A deep breath.
The quiet moment where you realize you’re doing better than you thought.

These are the little things that often go unseen. But they matter. They shape how we feel, how we respond, and how we grow. The more we practice noticing them, the more naturally we start to feel grounded, hopeful, and yes—more positive.

I am having extreme confusion lately despite having ended the relationship awhile ago. 

The “last straw”, so to speak, was an event that made me feel fearful even though he’s never physically harmed me. This was one of the handful of times (there have been about 3-4 in total throughout our 4 year relationship) that made me scared. Most of the time, his rages are purely verbal but this time he was acting intimidating and aggressive. He ridiculed me for saying this was “abuse” and I still feel confused about what to call it.

It started with him getting angry with me because I had a migraine (he’d kept me up late talking the night before so I was tired and didn’t feel well) and had to finish a school assignment, which made us 20 minutes late to get coffee. Then he started berating me and calling me names for leaving a single dish in the sink. So he started yelling at me, saying I was disrespecting him, getting very agitated. I told him he can’t talk to me disrespectfully like that, and then he got angrier and slammed down some cutlery (a knife) he has in his hand in the sink, making it bounce in the sink and slamming his fist down. This startled me and put me into a panic, so I left the apartment all day (for 6-7 hrs) to be away from him and calm myself down, going from one coffee shop to the next until it was dark and I finally had to come home. I was panicked because this wasn’t the first time he’s acted angry and aggressive and slammed his fists/thrown things around (never at me, but nearby). 

I came home and he made me an “apology” dinner (scrambled eggs, lol), where he basically just said “I’m sorry I got mad and slammed the knife into the sink, now can we stop fighting and get over it?” And it felt like a very weak apology, so I told him that he wasn’t understanding how serious I was about not tolerating that behavior anymore and how badly it caused me anxiety and made me feel scared. Then he got mad all over again, started raising his voice and yelling at me again, and telling me he regrets being “nice” to me and making me dinner (I am usually the one to make him dinner) and that he hoped the dinner tasted like shit. I beg him to stop yelling at me and to realize how serious I am about not tolerating his yelling, throwing, and aggression anymore. He keeps yelling at me, mocking and belittled me, saying I was acting ridiculous.

Finally, I snap back and yell (something I don’t normally do). That’s when it escalated. He started yelling at me louder, insulting me and following me from room to room despite me telling him to leave me alone and give me space. I tried to go into the other room to calm down and do some homework for my masters program and he said “you got me riled up, now I can’t focus so I won’t let you study either.” I asked him to please leave the room, going into the other room and he kept following me to yell at me. He grabbed a container of floss and threw it as hard as he could across the room at the wall, and it dented the wall then ricocheted around the room a few times. At this point I recoiled into the corner on the bed and reflexively covered my face, and tried as calmly as possible (so as to not anger him more) that I was scared and to please stop. He then said, in a very intimidating voice, that I hadn’t even seen him scary yet and threatened to “rip the entire apartment up”. He accused me of plotting to leave him, and called me a whore/bitch and said he was dumping me then told me to pack my shit and leave. He went to the computer to book me a hotel (it was 2am at this point). I started packing and finally he calmed down, apologized, and begged me not to leave. After that, he kept me up until 5am while crying the whole time and telling me how terrified he was that I would leave him and apologizing for “slipping up” with his angry impulsive behaviors (he blames all the incidents in his ADHD problems). He also made me watch YouTube videos about ADHD so I could understand that he behaves this way because he has a neurodevelopmental disorder and can’t control himself/regulate his emotions.

This was basically the last straw after a long string of emotionally abusive episodes followed by apologies and promises to change. But now I am questioning all of it. Was it really abusive? If so, what kind of abuse? I spoke to a DV advocate who told me what he did would have been considered assault in some states and could have had him arrested, even though I was unharmed. I don’t know if I believe that. I feel like a fraud and like I’m pathetic for even calling it abuse. I know it’s not healthy behavior, but part of me still thinks it’s just his ADHD and not genuinely abusive. When he’s not acting terribly, he’s my best friend, incredibly sweet, kind, loving, and fun. It’s all so confusing and I miss him so much. He also scares me unfortunately and I don’t know if I can feel safe around him, as dramatic as stupid as that sounds. I don’t know what to think about it, but part of me thinks it wasn’t actually that bad and I really overreacted. ",2,1748248613.0,emotionalabuse,3,1.0,False

I have a Breville/Sage Oracle Jet (yes I know, not a real machine for the pros here), but I got it because I wanted better coffee than an automatic, and still have something my wife could use without it getting overly complicated.  
  
Since I like espresso and americanos, and ""specialty"" coffee beans, I am looking at getting a grinder for that, so the daily beans can remain in the Oracle Jet and I can get a different kind whenever I like.  
  
My idea was, get a flat burr grinder, since that will give me even more options since the Oracle Jet has conical burrs.

So what did I research... a lot. At one moment I think, well surely a 300 euro machine will do, and the next I am looking at machines that cost 1000 euros. In my mind I only see issues and cumbersome operation or ugly design that will make me regret buying any grinder.

I want single dosing, use mostly light to medium roast, prefere a clean minimalist design and option to use a 58mm portafilter would be nice.

I have looked at these grinders for example, with local prices included:

* Eureka Mignon ORO SD (499 euros  currently, mostly 599 euros)
* DF54 (299 euros)
* DF 64 gen 2 (439 euros)
* Timemore Sculptor 064S (549 euros on sale / regular 699 euros)

The Kings and/or Queens are formal and become close friends, but the Prince and Princess do not. Being raised on the hatred their families had for one another, the two seem not to be over it. They are constantly at each other's throats, making fools of one another by embarrassing them at balls and gatherings, blaming the other for their own wrongdoings, or just plain verbally attacking one another. Will the two ever get along, or will they still keep the long-dead family feud alive?
2. ***The Knight and the Alchemist***\- Years of training as a knight have finally paid off, and you have officially been given the rank of Knight, which means you will soon be sent outside the castle walls on quests for your Kingdom. After your first few missions of simple vanquishing monsters and enemies that threatened the people, the King had called to you for a special mission, one of his generals has gone missing and was last heard weeks ago as he was tasked to conquer a rebels base, but no word has come back on the Generals werabouts, so you are tasked to go and find the General but you were to be aided by an Alchemist, to help heal you and aid you in your long and trecherous journey. It was always a drag being paired with others, but it was the King's orders, and you dared not disobey. So the two of you set off on your quest, and you hope this Alchemist won't drag you down.
3. ***Lattes and Love-*** Working day in and day out has become restless, and a pick-me-up is always needed to get through the day, but not just anything. Coffee is the main addiction and aid for long days and late-night work. At first, the small coffee shop was just an easy place to grab a quick cup or two, but after a while, you started to go for more than just the coffee. The cashier girl who worked there from open to close was always the best part, aside from the caffeine. In the first few months, you barely noticed her and only thought about how much she worked there to see her nearly every day at the same time. But the few days you went and she wasn't there, oddly, you made you miss her; it didn't feel the same without her there. Eventually, you started to spend as much time as you could there just to see her and maybe make the occasional small talk with her, but every time you had a minute alone with her, people rushed in, but today was the day you were gonna ask her out! Would she reject you, be embarrassed and weirded out, or not know who you are? Oh god it's your turn to order, quick, ask her out!
4. ***Old and New Hollywood-*** Years of being Hollywood's number one bachelor and actor have kept you at the top, and your standards have only risen as well. But in your newest film, you decided to branch out a bit and be in your first musical, singing was never your forte, but you don't wanna be a one-trick pony. But with this you were expecting another top of the line Hollywood star but instead, you are forced to work with the new girl in Hollywood, this was not to your liking, and you were not to be forced to work with her if she was to make this movie a disaster and tarnish your name. You tried to get out of this film or use your connections to get you a different co-star, but the studio wanted her and her alone to play the part. You found out she was a theater girl with little to no actor training; she was just a singing and dancing theater girl from Broadway who was picked to star in this role and finally take her first steps into Hollywood. Will you choose to make peace with the new girl on the Hollywood block, keep things only peaceful for the press and public, or will every day on set be hell on earth dealing with the untrained actor?
5. ***Fandom RPs-*** This is just a list of fandoms that I can RP, and with these, I will play as my OC, you can play as an OC or a Canon character. Black Butler, MHA, Kakegiri, Delicious and Dungeon, ATLA, Soul Eater, AoT, One Piece, Naruto, Demon Slayer, JJK, Tokyo Ghoul, Beastars, Chainsaw Man, Fire Force, DandaDan, and Pokémon

If any of these RPs interest you, please shoot me a message with the word ""shocking"" in it so I know you read this post and such. Now these RPs can be romantic or not romantic, which is perfectly fine with me, and if you want, we can RP on Discord as well.

So shoot me a message if you are interested, have a nice morning/day/afternoon/evening/night, to everyone\~!",3,1748248595.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False
1kvpfcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1kvpfcm/my_site_was_one_button_overweight/,My Site Was One Button Overweight,"**TL;DR**  
A **single <Button>** adds **38 kB** of JS to the bundle—yes, just the button. That WTF-moment made me build a tiny scale so you can weigh *any* component from popular UI kits: **https://impact.livog.com/ui/shadcn**. Punch in Button, Modal, Accordion—see how many bytes you’re really shipping, then decide if the juice is worth the payload.

Open Soruce here: [https://github.com/Livog/impact.livog.com](https://github.com/Livog/impact.livog.com)

I spent the weekend upgrading old Next.js project and one of the pages seemed very large for what it was displaying. So looked into and found a plain **Button** coming out to **38 kB** (min + gzip) from Hero UI. How is that even justifiable—does it brew my coffee too? Don't get me wrong, Hero UI is a very nice looking UI.

**Let's do some quick napkin math...**

PageSpeed Insights(mobile) simulates a **1.6 Mbps** line—roughly **200 kB/s**. In this example, we’ll assume the edge needs about 4**00 ms** to deliver the HTML document. That leaves **2.1 s** for the browser to fetch, parse, and paint everything users actually see. After round-trips, a bit of CPU work and some latency throttling, you get **≈ 290–330 kB** for anything that blocks render. The slower those critical‑path bytes land, the worse your LCP score will be. Starting to see the problem?

**""Not seeing the problem, it's just one component!""**

Sure. Handing the mic to marketing—they’ve got scripts to inject.

* **Google Tag Manager** — 114 kB *(basically a fancy script injector managed in Google—change my mind)*
* **Cookie banner** — 190 kB *(apparently “We use cookies” needs parallax and confetti—yes, I know it logs consent, runs geo rules, injects tags, bla bla bla., but c’mon… almost 200 kB?)*
* **Hotjar, analytics, chat widgets…** — nothing says “lean” like three scripts recording the same click

Need an A/B‑test framework to decide between #**B00B55** and #**B00BEE**? Sure, toss another 50 kB on the pile—what could possibly go wrong?

Suddenly your page is heavier than a 2002 LAN party—right on cue, having someone waving PageSpeed Insights scores, asking why the report is red instead of green. ""*shocked Pikachu face""*

A **38 kB** button plus the **102 kB** Next.js runtime, styles, fonts, SVGs, and a hero image? Starting to get touch, and we get to the impossible if button wasn't your only component. 

**What Actually Helps**

1. **Check RUM first.** If Real User Monitoring says things are 100/100, stop chasing that 100/100(mobile) Pagespeed Inisights and ship features people want.
2. **Weigh every import.** UI kits are great—until they aren’t. Tree‑shake, fork, or replace the heavy bits if performance is important to you.
3. **Stick to a budget.** Performance is arithmetic: stay under \~300 kB on the critical first view, or pay in seconds.
4. **Use Next.js dynamic** only for components hiding behind an `if`—think an *Alert* that appears after form submit. Wrapping your whole navbar in `dynamic()` isn’t a solution; it’s just extra luggage.
5. Still fighting oversized UI components? **Check out DaisyUI**—it's HTML and CSS first, zero JavaScript by default. Restyle it to match whatever UI library you love.

I hate recommending switching frameworks, since it often means you’re trying to solve the wrong problem. But if you’re still running into issues, it might be worth considering Astro—though changing ecosystems always comes with hidden costs.

I’ve pitched a built‑in “component weight report” for Next.js ( **https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/79617**) to try make devs more aware of their bundle size earlier.

Before you @ me.

* Yes, bundle size isn’t the only perf metric.
* Yes, numbers wiggle with tree-shaking and RSC.
* Yes, UI Libraries are gorgeous—but I use them in dashboards where perf can snooze.",13,1748248557.0,nextjs,5,1.0,False
1kvperq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1kvperq/letter_to_my_future_love/,Letter to my future love,"To the Woman I Haven’t Met (Yet),


The truth? I'm already intrigued. The way you talk... like you know you'll be a little dangerous for my peace of mind? You're right. But I'll love every second of it.


I don't know the sound of your laugh, the rhythm of your voice, or the way your eyes light up when you're lost in something you love. But I think about you more often than I care to admit.


You're a mystery I'm aching to unfold, page by page, day by day. I imagine the way your hand might fit in mine, the way our conversations might stretch into the early morning hours, effortless and infinite. I wonder what it will feel like the first time our paths cross, if you'll smile and I'll know, deep in my bones, that it was always meant to be you.


I'm not looking for perfection. I'm looking for something real. Someone who will see the mess and the beauty in me and choose to stay anyway. Someone I can build a quiet, steady kind of magic with—no fireworks needed, just a love that feels like home.


You've been dancing around the edges of my imagination, and let me tell you, the version of you in my mind? She's got an alluring smile, a laugh that makes my day better, and a way of looking at me like she knows all my secrets... and likes them anyway.


I want to learn all your quirks, your go-to coffee order, the way your voice changes when you talk about something you're passionate about. I want to tease you, challenge you, make you laugh until you can't breathe—and then kiss you quiet.


Let's skip the part where I pretend to be subtle. I think about the tension that'll hang between us when we first meet. You'll act like you're unimpressed, but your eyes will say otherwise. And I'll smile, that slow, knowing kind of smile, because I'll already know: you're the one l've been waiting for. 

I like a woman who knows what she wants. Even more, I like a woman who can keep up. So when we finally meet—don’t be shy. Bring that fire. Look at me like you’ve already undressed me in your thoughts (you have, haven’t you?). Touch me like you’ve been waiting your whole life. And talk to me like no one else exists.


I’m not looking for ordinary. I want wild nights and soft mornings. I want banter that turns into kisses, and kisses that leave us breathless. I want to make you feel seen, wanted, and wrecked in the best way. You deserve someone who never stops choosing you. Every damn day. 

Just one thing, darling: when you fall—and you will fall—make sure it’s deep. I don’t do halfway. I want all of you, or nothing at all.

Until then, I’m working on becoming someone worthy of you. Someone who won’t just love you, but will cherish you. Who will protect your heart like it’s a fragile miracle. Because that’s what I believe love should be—a sanctuary, not a battlefield.


So take your time, love. But not too much time—l'm getting a little impatient over here lol.


Wherever you are, I hope you're safe and I hope you're smiling. I'll be here when the timing is right.


To the woman who's already got my attention,

I am planing a vacation for 4 people in bitez, we will have a car so we will travel around the coast also with the restaurants… for some reason no restaurant has prices on their websites… would any you know how much can I estimate to pay for dinners for 4 people this year? Lets say 4 drinks, 4 dishes - and some dessert coffee after? 

Or if you know where I can find those prices? 

Last year we stayed in Bitez and were paying normal prices I assume.. however I saw increase in prices this year.. we needed to look for different accommodation this year as our usual place requested 1000 e extra! 

I wonder how it is in restaurants ? 

Will 2000 Lira get me nice dinner still or should I count more ?

1kvpcb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kvpcb1/am_i_overreacting_i_was_told_this_could/,Am I overreacting? I was told this could technically be considered domestic assault in some states (depending on laws) but I don’t know if I believe that. I don’t know what to think.,"I am having extreme confusion lately despite having ended the relationship awhile ago. 

The “last straw”, so to speak, was an event that made me feel fearful even though he’s never physically harmed me. This was one of the handful of times (there have been about 3-4 in total throughout our 4 year relationship) that made me scared. Most of the time, his rages are purely verbal but this time he was acting intimidating and aggressive. He ridiculed me for saying this was “abuse” and I still feel confused about what to call it.

It started with him getting angry with me because I had a migraine (he’d kept me up late talking the night before so I was tired and didn’t feel well) and had to finish a school assignment, which made us 20 minutes late to get coffee. Then he started berating me and calling me names for leaving a single dish in the sink. So he started yelling at me, saying I was disrespecting him, getting very agitated. I told him he can’t talk to me disrespectfully like that, and then he got angrier and slammed down some cutlery (a knife) he has in his hand in the sink, making it bounce in the sink and slamming his fist down. This startled me and put me into a panic, so I left the apartment all day (for 6-7 hrs) to be away from him and calm myself down, going from one coffee shop to the next until it was dark and I finally had to come home. I was panicked because this wasn’t the first time he’s acted angry and aggressive and slammed his fists/thrown things around (never at me, but nearby). 

I came home and he made me an “apology” dinner (scrambled eggs, lol), where he basically just said “I’m sorry I got mad and slammed the knife into the sink, now can we stop fighting and get over it?” And it felt like a very weak apology, so I told him that he wasn’t understanding how serious I was about not tolerating that behavior anymore and how badly it caused me anxiety and made me feel scared. Then he got mad all over again, started raising his voice and yelling at me again, and telling me he regrets being “nice” to me and making me dinner (I am usually the one to make him dinner) and that he hoped the dinner tasted like shit. I beg him to stop yelling at me and to realize how serious I am about not tolerating his yelling, throwing, and aggression anymore. He keeps yelling at me, mocking and belittled me, saying I was acting ridiculous.

Finally, I snap back and yell (something I don’t normally do). That’s when it escalated. He started yelling at me louder, insulting me and following me from room to room despite me telling him to leave me alone and give me space. I tried to go into the other room to calm down and do some homework for my masters program and he said “you got me riled up, now I can’t focus so I won’t let you study either.” I asked him to please leave the room, going into the other room and he kept following me to yell at me. He grabbed a container of floss and threw it as hard as he could across the room at the wall, and it dented the wall then ricocheted around the room a few times. At this point I recoiled into the corner on the bed and reflexively covered my face, and tried as calmly as possible (so as to not anger him more) to say that I was scared and to please stop. He then said, in a very intimidating voice, that I hadn’t even seen him scary yet and threatened to “rip the entire apartment up”. 

He accused me of plotting to leave him, and called me a whore/bitch and said he was dumping me then told me to pack my shit and leave. He went to the computer to book me a hotel (it was 2am at this point). I started packing and finally he calmed down, apologized, and begged me not to leave. After that, he kept me up until 5am while crying the whole time and telling me how terrified he was that I would leave him and apologizing for “slipping up” with his angry impulsive behaviors (he blames all the incidents on his ADHD and anger problems). He also made me watch YouTube videos about ADHD so I could understand that he behaves this way because he has a neurodevelopmental disorder and can’t control himself/regulate his emotions.

This was basically the last straw after a long string of emotionally abusive episodes followed by apologies and promises to change. But now I am questioning all of it. Was it really abusive? If so, what kind of abuse? I spoke to a DV advocate who told me what he did would have been considered assault in some states and could have had him arrested, even though I was unharmed. I don’t know if I believe that. I feel like a fraud and like I’m pathetic for even calling it abuse. I know it’s not healthy behavior, but part of me still thinks it’s just his ADHD and not genuinely abusive. When he’s not acting terribly, he’s my best friend, incredibly sweet, kind, loving, and fun. It’s all so confusing and I miss him so much. He also scares me unfortunately and I don’t know if I can feel safe around him, as dramatic as stupid as that sounds. I don’t know what to think about it, but part of me thinks it wasn’t actually that bad and I really overreacted. ",1,1748248208.0,AmIOverreacting,15,1.0,False

1kvparq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kvparq,Flakes (husk) after grinding. Toffeecoffee roasters.,"Hi guys I'm new to speciality coffee. It's been less than a month since I joined this subreddit and learns how much of a shit toffeecoffee was. I had been busy their cold brew bags for roughly 2 years. However since like the last 6 months I found their service to have gone worse and the coffee to be even more so. This was my first batch of beans from them (caramel blonde). I bought an electric grinder from one of the members of this group. (Agaro one. Ik it's not great for espresso, but I mostly make cold brews in summer and plan to make pore overs during winters)
Back to main point. Are these flakes a sign of poor quality? Cuz it's ALOT!",6,1748248025.0,IndiaCoffee,5,0.88,False

1kvp8y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/bhutan/comments/1kvp8y5/beautiful_stranger_i_saw_in_town/,beautiful stranger i saw in town,"i just saw the most beautiful stranger and my heart hurts knowing that I’ll never see them again. Couldn’t really determine their gender but my gut tells me it’s a woman who was also most probably a foreigner. I was walking behind them for like 4 minutes. I tried my best not to look but i couldn’t take my eyes off of them.

So, if u have semi curly and short hair and were wearing black loafers, carrying a camera and a coffee whist walking through Thimphu town around 1-2 pm, please know that my gay ass tried its best not to become a creep and follow you and that i’m heartbroken because of you 🥲
