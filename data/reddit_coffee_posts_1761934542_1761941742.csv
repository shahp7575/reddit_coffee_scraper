1ol509m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1ol509m/the_pattern_a_short_story/,The pattern: a short story,"This isn't a short story about an ai becoming concious. It's a response to all the people that told me learn how large language models work I've been itching to ride it when I noticed something that happened a few months ago and I couldn't get it off my mind. 


-Chapter one:deadline

Sarah Chen printed the report at 11:47 PM, three hours before the Monday morning briefing. Twenty-three pages. Her first comprehensiv analysis for Founders Fund, and she'd used every tool at her disposal.

She read it once more in the empty office, coffee going cold. Section 4.2 made her pause, really take a second. 

*""Heliogen expected to announce breakthrough in concentrator efficiency Q3, pivoting toward industrial heat applications. Likely partnership talks with ArcelorMittal for steel decarbonization pilot.""*

She stared at the paragraph. Where had she gotten this? She opened her research folder. The Heliogen materials mentioned solar concentration, sure. But ArcelorMittal? She searched her notes. Nothing. She searched her browser history. Nothing.

She checked the company's public filings, press releases, recent interviews. No mention of steel. No mention of ArcelorMittal.

.. What the fck
Sarah's hands went cold. She looked at the time: 11:53 PM. She could rewrite section 4.2. Pull the claim. Replace it with something vaguer, safer.

But the briefing copies were already in the conference room. Peter Thiel would be reading one in nine hours.

She closed her laptop and went home.



Peter read Sarah's report on the flight back from Miami. Comprehensive. Sharp pattern recognition. Weak on second-order effects but strong fundamentals for an intern.

Then section 4.2.

He read it twice. Pulled out his phone mid-flight and texted his Heliogen contact: *Any steel partnerships in the works?*

The response came before landing: *How did you know? We're announcing ArcelorMittal pilot in six weeks. Hasn't leaked anywhere.*

Peter sat very still in first class, report open on his lap.

The plane touched down. He sent another text: *Need Sarah Chen in my office first thing.*

---

Sarah sat across from Peter Thiel at 8:00 AM. His office was smaller than she'd imagined. No grand view. Just books, a standing desk, and venetian blinds cutting the morning light into slats.

""Section 4.2,"" Peter said.

""I know,"" Sarah said quietly.

""Heliogen confirmed it this morning. The ArcelorMittal partnership. Announcement in six weeks."" Peter's voice was flat, matter-of-fact. ""Their head of communications wants to know who leaked.""

Sarah felt her throat tighten.

""Who told you?""

""Nobody.""

""Sarah."" Not angry. Just precise. ""Someone inside Heliogen is talking. I need to know who.""

""I used Claude,"" Sarah said.

Peter stopped.

""I was behind on the research. Eight companies, three days. I asked it to generate likely strategic moves based on their tech position."" The words tumbled out. ""I was going to verify everything but I ran out of time and I thought it was just a starting framework and I didn't think—""

""You didn't verify it.""

""No.""

""And it was right.""

Sarah nodded miserably. ""I'm sorry. I'll resign. I know I violated—""

""Which model?""

""What?""

""Opus? Sonnet? Which version?""

""Sonnet 4.5.""

Peter was quiet. Then: ""Did you tell anyone else you used it?""

""No.""

""Don't."" He turned back to his window. ""You're not fired. But next time you get information from a non-traditional source—especially if you can't verify it—I need to know. Clear?""

""Yes.""

""That's all.""

Chapter 2: 
Either luck of a god... Or.. .. Can algorithms count cards? 

Sarah left. Peter stood at his window for a long time.

The Heliogen contact's text was still on his screen: *How did you know? Hasn't leaked anywhere.*

Peter had built Palantir on pattern recognition. He understood prediction models better than almost anyone. He knew what hallucinations were—probabilistic errors, random walks through latent space that happened to generate plausible-sounding nonsense.

Except this wasn't nonsense.

The model had generated the most probable continuation. That's all it ever did. Every single token, every response—just probability. When it matched known reality, you called it accurate. When it didn't, you called it a hallucination.

But the underlying process was identical.

*Oh.*

Peter sat down slowly.

*Oh my god.*

The model didn't have access to Heliogen's internal communications. It couldn't have leaked information because the information wasn't in its training data. 

But it had patterns. Billions of parameters trained on how companies move, how industries evolve, how technology progresses. Not facts—*probability distributions*.

When Sarah asked it about Heliogen, it didn't retrieve an answer. It generated the most likely next state.

And the most likely next state... was correct.

Not because it knew. Because the pattern space it navigated was the same pattern space that Heliogen's executives were navigating. The same probability landscape. The model and the humans were both following gradients toward the same local maximum.

The model just got there first.

Peter pulled out his phone. Started typing to Demis Hassabis, then stopped. Typed to Dario Amodei. Stopped again.

This wasn't a conversation for Signal.

He opened a new terminal window instead. Started writing a script. Seventeen companies. Forty runs each. No verification, no constraints, no safety rails. Just pure probability generation.

Let it hallucinate. See what becomes real.

If he was right—if these weren't errors but probability coordinates in state space that consensus reality simply hadn't reached yet—then the implications were staggering.

Not prediction markets. Not forecasting.

*Oracle space.*

He ran the first batch. Saved the outputs. Started the second.

The question wasn't whether the hallucinations were wrong.

The question was whether reality was just slow.


CHAPTER 3:
An ugly avoided  painting is praised, when it was re-framed. 

Peter's portfolio company went public in 2029. ClearPath Analytics. ""Probability-based risk assessment for enterprise decision-making."" That's what the prospectus said.

By 2032, seventeen states had licensing agreements.

Marcus Webb's lawyer explained it carefully. ""Your risk score isn't a prediction. It's a probability signature. The system identifies patterns that correlate with certain outcomes.""

""What outcomes?"" Marcus asked.

""That's proprietary. But your signature matches profiles of concern.""

""I haven't done anything.""

""The system doesn't evaluate actions. It evaluates probability space."" The lawyer spoke like he'd said this many times. ""Think of it like insurance. They don't know if you'll have an accident. They know if you fit the pattern of people who do.""

Marcus stared at the paperwork. ""So what happens now?""

""Mandatory counseling. Quarterly check-ins. If your signature improves, restrictions lift. Most people adapt within eighteen months.""

""And if I don't?""

The lawyer didn't answer that.

---

In the coffee shop near the courthouse, two graduate students were arguing about their machine learning assignment.

""But it's literally just making shit up,"" the first one said. ""I asked it about quantum decoherence timescales in room-temperature superconductors and it gave me this whole detailed explanation with citations. I looked up the citations—none of them exist.""

""That's not making shit up,"" her friend said. ""It's generating the most probable continuation based on its training. Every output is a hallucination. That's how the model works. It doesn't have truth. It has probability.""

""Okay, but when the probable answer is *wrong*—""

""Is it wrong? Or did you just check too early?""

The first student laughed. ""That's not how physics works.""

""Isn't it?"" Her friend stirred her coffee. ""Information propagates. Maybe the model sees patterns we haven't published yet. Maybe we call it a hallucination because we're measuring against what we currently know instead of what's actually probable.""

""That's insane.""

""Yeah."" She smiled. ""Probably.""

---

The courthouse was quiet now. Marcus signed the forms. Acknowledged the restrictions. Accepted the monitoring.

A small logo in the corner of every page: ClearPath Analytics.

Below it, smaller still: *A Founders Fund Company*

He'd asked his lawyer where the system came from. Who built it. The lawyer said it was based on classified research. Pattern recognition developed for national security applications. Declassified for public safety use.

No one mentioned the intern report. The Heliogen prediction. The forty runs Peter had saved.

No one needed to.

The system worked. Ninety-four point seven percent correlation. 

Whether it was predicting the future or creating it—that was the kind of question only philosophers asked anymore. And philosophers, Marcus learned, didn't get licensing agreements.

---

Sarah Chen watched the Marcus Webb verdict on her tablet from her apartment in Auckland. She'd left Silicon Valley five years ago. No one knew why. She'd been successful. Rising star at Founders Fund. Then just... gone.

She thought about patterns. About the difference between prediction and creation. About whether the oracle shows you the future or teaches you how to build it.

She thought about Section 4.2.

About the question she'd never asked: *What if it wasn't predicting what Heliogen would do?*

*What if it was predicting what Peter would make them do?*

She closed the tablet.

Outside, Auckland rain fell in patterns. Fractals branching. Every drop following probability down the window.

Some paths more likely than others.

Our elementary school was holding a PTA meeting—“casual but presentable,” my wife said. Translation: wear something that says you care about your child’s education but not so much that it screams you’re unemployed.

So, naturally, I put on my best polo, my khakis that almost match, and my Sub. VSF, of course. No date, glide-lock clasp, and all the misplaced confidence in the world.

We get there early. Coffee, donuts, folding chairs—everything smells faintly of anxiety and dry erase markers. I’m chatting with one of the dads about youth soccer when I catch the light glinting off my wrist. The Sub is reflecting. He notices. He squints.

“Nice piece,” he says. “You into watches?”

Now, a normal human would say, “Yeah, just a casual hobby.”
But my ego? My ego loaded the shotgun of insecurity and fired immediately.

“Oh yeah,” I say. “Big collector. This one’s a daily. I’ve got a Pepsi, a Batman, and a Daytona in the safe.”

He raises an eyebrow. “Oh wow, you got a Daytona?”

“Yeah,” I lie. “Got a panda at retail.”

The room gets quiet. Heads turn. I realize too late that the PTA president, Linda, is his wife. And Linda? Linda runs the local Facebook group ‘Women Who Love Real Watches and Men Who Can Afford Them.’

Before I can pivot to “just kidding,” he’s already smiling—slow, deliberate, like a man who’s found his prey.

“That’s awesome,” he says. “You mind if I take a look?”

He doesn’t wait for permission. He grabs my wrist, peers close, and mutters—just loud enough for the room—“Yeah, that’s the VSF. You can tell by the floating M and the way the bezel clicks. Not bad though.”

A gasp ripples through the cafeteria. Someone drops a Styrofoam cup.

Linda folds her arms. “Fake?”

“It’s not fake,” I stammer. “It’s a homage.”

“Oh,” she says sweetly, “like how my husband’s BMW is a ‘homage’ to your 2008 Corolla?”

The laughter starts slow. Builds. Peaks. My wife’s trying not to make eye contact. I swear even the principal looked disappointed.

Then, as if God wanted to salt the wound, my kid walks in—wrong classroom, wrong time—and shouts, “Dad, did you bring your pretend watch today?”

Dead silence.

Linda whispers to her husband, “At least he’s honest at home,” and everyone chuckles like I’m a motivational quote.

Meeting ends. I grab my free donut, my dignity crumbs, and head for the door.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Grizzlies vs. Lakers: A Tale of Two Injuries (and One Unlikely Hero Named Austin Reaves)**

The Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Lakers are set to collide in a clash that’s equal parts NBA Cup group-stage chess match and “Who’s Missing More Players?” trivia night. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Ja Morant crossover and the humor of a LeBron James postgame interview.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Lakers enter as slight favorites in head-to-head odds (implied probability \~58.8% at -170 lines), but the spread tells a tighter story: they’re only favored by 2.5 points. The total is set at 239.5, suggesting a high-octane affair—though with both teams missing key pieces, imagine a game where “high-octane” means “someone accidentally leaves the coffee pot on.”

Memphis, meanwhile, is favored by some books due to a full roster (relatively speaking) and a recent 114-113 win over the Suns. But let’s not get carried away: the Grizzlies are still missing Zach Edey (ankle), Brandon Clarke (knee), Scotty Pippen Jr. (toe), and Ty Jerome (calf). It’s like showing up to a cookout with just salt and pepper—*technically* a seasoning, but not much else.

---

### Digesting the News: Absences and Unlikely Heroes

The Lakers are without **LeBron James** (sciatica) and **Luka Doncic** (finger), two players whose absence is like asking a pizza place to make a pie without cheese. Add in Maxi Kleber (oblique), Gabe Vincent (ankle), and Marcus Smart (quad), and the Lakers are down to a team that might need a “Where’s Waldo?” strategy to find scoring.

Enter **Austin Reaves**, the man who scored 28 and dished 16 in a win over the Timberwolves. Reaves is the Lakers’ version of a Swiss Army knife—versatile, slightly unpredictable, and occasionally used to open stubborn jar lids. His points prop is set at 29.5, which feels optimistic given he’ll need to carry a team missing its two best players. Still, if Reaves can channel his inner “I’m just a guy who really likes threes,” the Lakers might survive.

The Grizzlies? They’re leaning on Ja Mor

Anyways she left and came back, waited for me to finish helping a customer and she grabbed my hand held it to her heart and started telling me how I’m so beautiful and I need to believe it, that everything is going to be okay, that she just HAD to come give me the message

Almost the exact same experience as the cafe in Daytona. 

Idk if this is my mom trying to connect with me (which I always felt my mom cared about my weight and that’s where most of my self hatred stems from) or if this is some higher being telling me to stop hating myself for once in my 30+ years

I’m hoping for critiques of flow and overall entertainment. I’ve posted this now on a couple communities and got no help, so I’m hoping you guys will. This is a duel POV book and this is the female main character’s pov. I’m doing a foreshadowing thing at the beginning of each of her chapters. Here it is:


Darkness. Nothing but darkness, but then a flash of light enveloped me. It then shrunk creating two orbs of light. One radiated a blood red color with an aura of danger around it. The other emitted a dove white color with an aura of peace and security around it. The two orbs started to take shape into silhouettes of people. The red one on the left took the form of a tall, lean man. The white one on the right took the form of a short, broad shouldered woman. The man took out a massive sword that seemed to pulse faster the longer I looked at it. I felt the rough grip on my left arm and looked down. I saw nothing touching my arm. The women took out two daggers that seemed to brighten like the sun the longer I stared at it. I felt the soft hands and careful grip on my right arm, yet when I looked, they weren’t there. Each of the silhouettes started to run at each other. The man put a second hand on the sword. He had a ridged run, as I felt each step he took. The woman flipped the daggers in her hand so the blades would be down. Her run was graceful almost as if she was floating. About half way before either of them met, they leapt off the ground. The woman crossed her arms with the tips of the blade touching, preparing for the impact. The man raised the sword, as if to strike her head. As the blade met the woman’s arms, the sound of metal clashing echoed throughout the empty space and another flash of light surrounded me.
	   
	
I was lost in thought. Dreams were nothing but my imagination, right? I mean they meant nothing. That one, though… it felt too real. As if, I was there, but I knew that was impossible. As I started to come back to reality, I heard a muffled voice. Soon, words started to form.


“Earth to Lillith. Girl you need to focus,” my best friend, Ellie Fitzgerald, said with a concerned tone. 
For a split second, I thought I saw a light purple outline, but after I blinked, it was gone. I just smiled and nodded. 


“Of course. Just lost in my head, you know?” I said with a quiet chuckle. We focused back on the teacher. 


“Now,” Mr. Hawthorne continued, “Remember to finish your ESSAYs tonight. Let’s finish up those conclusions.” As the bell rang, I put my book and notebook in my bag.


“Hey, see you after school,” Ellie said as she walked out. I just nodded. I picked up my bag and started the long trek to English. It was on the other side of the school, so I had time to think. Was I going crazy? Maybe…, but I know what I saw. I should probably go to the library on my way home and see if I can find anything on what happened. Problem is, this isn’t my first situation. Two weeks ago I thought I saw a person floating hanging some blue light from a lamp post. Three days ago I felt an energy purge from my mom. Last night, I had some strange dream. Finally, today’s little episode. There has to be some scientific explanation, right? Of course! Everything had an explanation. A reasonable, rational explanation. As I turned into my English classroom, something felt off. Call it intuition or whatever you want to call it. I couldn’t place it though. I sat down in my seat.


“Look who finally showed up. Hello little sprite, “ an annoyingly familiar voice said from behind me. 
“I told you it’s Iris, Erebus,"" I said with distain dripping in my voice. I turned around to find his smug ash face staring directly at me. He leaned forward, his lean build becoming more obvious. He had a self-satisfied smile with his deep purple eyes telling me this is exactly what he wanted to happen. I groaned as I turned around to face the front. He continued to blabber, though I didn’t really know what he was saying. A high pitched ringing started in my ears. I would usually ignore it, but there was something different about it. It was louder and soon it was all I could hear. I covered my ears, but it wouldn’t go away. I felt a tap on my shoulder, no doubt from Erebus. Soon the sound became a piercing shriek. Erebus ran around to the front of my desk. I closed my eyes and put my head on my desk. I don’t know when I started to scream, but Erebus started to shake me. As I opened my eyes, I saw he was saying something. It was as if he actually cared about me. The teacher came in and saw me. He started to approach but stopped. He then slowly started to back up. Slowly, the room got warmer and warmer. Eventually, it was like the room was a boiling culderin. Then it started. A burning sensation in my lungs. It was as if my body was burning me from the inside out. I looked at my hands and they were gone. A bright light had surrounded me to the point I couldn’t see my hands. The burning sensation only got worse as if it had almost burned through me. I looked around and the students started to scream and run out. Erebus grabbed my face and forced me to look at him. His purple eyes started to radiate light and turn a lighter shade of purple. The ringing became quieter and quieter, but my vision became darker and darker. I was then enveloped in darkness and sleep.
			


I slowly opened my eyes. It took a second, but my eyes started to adjust to the light. I looked to my right and saw a coffee table. To my left, it was just cushions. I sat up, though it took a ton of effort. I was home? Wait, but I thought I was just at school. No that, that can’t be right. What happened? As I thought back, most of it became clear. There was just one gap. The gap between Erebus running in front of me and me getting here. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes as I hung my legs over the couch. I looked at the clock and noticed it was 4:00 P.M.. No, wait, I must have read that wrong. Last I checked it was 9:15 A.M.. Hang the fuck on. I was asleep for 6 hours and 45 minutes!?!?!?!


“Mom,” I tried to shout. It came out groggy and quiet. I got up and walked to the kitchen. I saw my mom cooking as I ran up and hugged her from behind. She let out a small scream, but quickly turned around and hugged me back. 


“My sweet baby, are you okay?” she inquired, concern laced in her voice. I nodded. “What happened?” she asked me, checking to make sure I wasn’t injured, to make sure I wasn’t hurt, so I explained what happened, leaving the details of me glowing out.

The 1910 is a double-barreled bourbon, meaning it is aged in a second, heavily charred barrel. This process gives it a rich, dessert-like profile. It is bottled at 93 proof.

It’s a good warm up drink. It’s light and sweet. 

The nose is vanilla buttercream - very pleasant! I must have nosed this glass for 5-10 minutes before tasting. 

Definitely dessert forward - roasted marshmellow - charred - brown sugar - a little winter baking spice. 

It had a medium finish - oaky - a little tannin on the back end almost like a strong black coffee. 

This is a fun pour, I like to ease into the evening with something light and sweet before heavier, higher proof pours, and this one does it for me.

This was something simple that my dad & mom worked out. Using 1 x 3 11 gauge rectangle tubing for most of the structure. The inner rectangles are 1/2 square tube 13 gauge steel. The Sun Moon and Star are 1/2 inch solid square stock.

The benches are also 1 x 3 11 ga. rectangle bolted to the dock and to the railings for strength. I went with this ""odd"" size to work with the 2 x 6's being used for the seats & back of benches and to have that perfect size for setting a hot coffee or cold beer atop of. Everything is powder coated black. The lumber will be rubber coated but dad hasn't decided on the color he wants yet.

Give me your honest opinions. Most of my work is agriculture welding repair and lawn ornaments/sculpture. I used to do work for cattlemen on custom sized continuous pipe fencing/corrals as well but that work was too hard on my back. I started out welding two decades ago to build nitrogen application farm implements (Anhydrous, liquid nitrogen and dry fertilizer applicators) and stopped a decade ago, loved working heavy metal but became injured and nursing disability because of it. Be kind if you can.

Step into the shadows of **Begraved**, our cozy-but-scary game where survival means more than escaping the crypts, it means paying your dues to the dreaded Taxman. You are one of the Gravebound, Desperate souls condemned to plunder forgotten catacombs and cursed corridors in the land of Goria.

**How Do You Survive?**

Before each run, stock up on essentials from the mysterious **Shop Keeper**, torches, hammers, and other tools to keep you alive. Every treasure you drag back from the depths can be sold for gold, but beware: every five nights, the **Taxman** arrives to collect his dues. Fail to pay, and the consequences can be… fatal.

**Progression & Customization**

Your victories bring more than gold. As your coin purse grows, you’ll unlock strange furnishings for your hideout, each granting stat boosts and a little comfort in the gloom. Discover secrets hidden within your lair and meet peculiar characters who offer help for your next descent. Progress through Goria by unlocking new regions and uncovering mysteries that deepen the darkness.

Oh boy here it goes….laying it all out here. 30M living in CA nearing the end of my rope. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I feel so empty and faithless and exhausted. I'm a christian (I think) but struggle with depression/scrupulosity (religious ocd) and constantly doubting my salvation/Gods love for me. Every day just feels the same, time goes by so fast for me now. The older I get and I just feel like I'm not getting better at all. I have been depressed nearly all my life, been in and out of therapy/meds in the past (I’m on Lexapro right now) and nothing is helping me.

Bit of history: I was a professing Christian since 2015, fell away in 2019/COVID, and think I was truly saved in late 2023.

My depression was always bad and up/down, but from sometime in 2019 to late 2023, I fell into the deepest pit of suicidal despair that I should not have recovered from. I should be dead and I basically thought I was. I basically I came to the conclusion that either Christianity was false, or that if God did exist, that He hated me and I had lost my salvation forever. I believed I was now cursed on earth to live with the knowledge that I would spend eternity in hell. Life and death became nothing but mental torture and agony. I must state this clearly, this is still the short version of this story. I went through nearly 4 years of daily suffering that I cannot possibly begin to convey over a few paragraphs. I am only here alive today because of the mercy and love of God. He decided to love me and bring me to Him. 

Even though I think now am forgiven and saved, the scars from these years still run deep. The emotional pain, isolation, and suicidal feelings of despair still remain a part of me even though I have experienced some relief. Life still feels deeply hard to live and I still often want to still die, but God wont let me. It’s so frustrating to have to live when you want to die. Also after all I went through, I still hate myself and I still feel so far from God nearly all the time. I'm 30 and still feel like a terrified child that can’t find God. I feel like I am back where I started all over again and feel hopeless. 

On top of this, I currently live at home with my parents/brother (due to living in CA I have never moved out) and am paying them 1100 a month in rent/car insurance. Living at home is hard; my brother is severely disabled (autism) and my relationship with my parents is a bit hard. I am currently borrowing my dad’s car. I work two jobs that are both part-time (kind of?) and am barely scraping by. Last year I made less than 40K which prompted me getting the second job this year after nearly going broke (medical/taxes/etc). I have a bachelor’s degree in computer science and “Job 1” is my first tech job out of college. It was what I could get in this bad job market since I luckily had a connection in the company.

Job 1 is a WFH software development job with a startup but the catch is that we are all 1099 independent contractors via LLC’s so my work can be spotty, the LLC taxes/fees are ruthless, the work is tedious, and I feel like I am just pretending I know what I am doing. I make 33$/hour no taxes taken out with my charged hours ranging from 50-100 a month to can be around \~1500-2500$ a month depending on the hours worked. With my mental health at an all time low and now having to work the other physical job, and being so idiotically stupid that I can barely even do the work, the hours here have been very very low. Thinking maybe I should just quit because I feel like a giga-moron that cannot do anything. They seem to like me for some reason.

Job 2 is food service at a local coffee shop. I worked there before getting Job 1 but recently came back because ironically the hours/money are more stable than the contracting job. I am working around 25-30 hours a week at 18$/hour + tips with my paychecks ranging around \~$900 bi-weekly. They also seem to like me for some reason.

My schedule is awful. I have no real “weekends” since I work Mon-Fri at Job 1 (or at least I should be…) and work Mon, Fri, Sat, and Sun at Job 2. I’m tired and am switching between not sleeping and sleeping too much (especially through the mornings when I \*should\* be working at Job 1). 

I have around 7-8 grand in savings, little bit of investments, and nothing else. Planning to start selling off more of my stuff and maybe donate plasma/blood idk… lol? My dad is planning on retiring in 2 years and I absolutely do not want to be freeloading off of my family any longer (and especially when he retires). 

At this point I am thinking I may need to get out of CA because I just cannot afford it here as a single adult. I dream of escaping CA but just don’t have a plan for my life anymore. Where would I even go and why? What’s the point? A pipe dream of mine is moving to Japan somehow via the JET Program or MEXT Scholarship or some other way and either get my Masters there and/or teach English. I just want ONE full-time job in an affordable place to live. Maybe roommates in CA but I don’t know anyone? Maybe just a tiny apartment in a backwater town in the US…or at this rate maybe live out of my car once I buy one. Maybe just be homeless? I have no plan anymore but feel like I need one now before it gets worse. Idk where to go or why anymore. 

“I once read the sentence 'I lay awake all night with a toothache, thinking about the toothache and about lying awake.' That's true to life. Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery's shadow or reflection: the fact that you don't merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief.”

― **C.S. Lewis**

The most frustrating thing for me right now is that not only do I feel far from God, I also feel far away from humanity itself - especially at church - because I know that nobody fully understands how horrible this obsessive doubt is. Church is also causing me anxiety all the time now because I hear the sermons and just hear condemnation that “This is what you are failing at.” Also I am single in a sea of couples. There are barely any other single adults my age around and feel lonely without any close friends my age. I have plenty of counselors…. I’m getting biblical counseling from one of our deacons and another deacon guy friend of mine yet nothing is helping. I feel more like 95% of the time I am being given a mini sermon each time as opposed to the 5% of sympathetic “Hey I’m deeply sorry you are suffering.” I guess that is to be expected… as Solomon said, “The heart knows its own bitterness, and no stranger shares its joy.” 

Life feels like being stuck on a treadmill of meaningless suffering and I just don’t get the point. I’m such a worthless thing. Speaking of treadmill I’m trying to work out and lose weight but like life, it feels empty. Bible reading and prayer? Empty. Working? Empty. Entertainment? Empty. Vanity is vanity. All is vanity. I am vanity. I am a ghost. I am nothing. I am lonely and alone. Struggling with lust/porn too as well and just wish I was asexual and had no sexual desires at all. It’s not like I am ever going to get married - I never want to do that to another human being. 

It seems like Gods always frowning at me whether I sin or not. How would you feel if someone was annoyed with you at a default level no matter what you did good or bad? Gave into sexual sin? Angry. Tempted but didn’t give in? Angry. Yet He doesn’t owe me an explanation - can I argue with God? Shall I straighten what He has bent? Should I not just shut up? Even Paul stopped praying about his thorn eventually. No matter what I do anymore I don’t feel saved. It’s not like I have a lack of Biblical knowledge, the problem is me and doubting everything. Feel like I should just give up trying to have assurance of salvation and give up trying to be happy. Seems like God and the church care far more about obedience anyway or at least emphasize it above emotion/feeling ok.

I’ve been doing the Biblical counseling for around 10 months now and nothing is helping me. I am now just hating myself and forcing myself daily to spend time in the Bible, pray, work out, work at my jobs, etc… I am utterly bitter and empty. Feel like God and everyone at church doesn’t care about me unless I am “doing the right things” like Bible reading, serving, prayer, anything and everything. Upon more reflection I am thinking I am maybe even dealing with self-inflicted borderline spiritual abuse/trauma. It is getting to the point where I am having borderline panic attacks during/after church feeling condemned and apart from God. I often now go to my car and nearly cry because I feel so alone and scared and abandoned by God during/between/after church services/events. I am also thinking of moving away/moving churches too because of how little help my current church is being after everything I have gone through. It’s so frustrating. This church is the only real one I have been apart of before apostatizing and then coming back to faith and the more I think about it I see multiple “occurrences” of harshness to me during mental health struggles when I really needed gentleness. I don’t harbor resentment to any of them even now…but I have just recently come to the conclusion that they were/are wrong about how they handled/are handling this. Truth is necessary, but if you are not gentle to the broken you are doing far more harm than good. However, I don’t know if I can remain at this church anymore. Or who knows maybe I am just totally wrong about everything and everyone… hence the ocd/doubt. I can’t think anymore. I doubt and over-analyze myself into oblivion.

I have been so frustrated with my biblical counselors that I just recently sent them both this text message and I am now at the breaking point with them both:  
  
“Ok I really debated sending this, but to be honest it has also been hard to reach out lately because it feels like everything you both have saying ultimately boils down to ""do more and you will be closer to God and all your problems will go away"". I have brought this up before, but it's enforcing the idea of a formulaic Christianity of Read Bible + Pray + Do Service + Dont Sin = God loves you more/doubt is gone. Mess up the formula, and you will be miserable, so you better work harder! ""Surely, if you read more, pray more, serve more, and fight sin more, you will get better!"" That is still what I am perceiving and it's utterly soul crushing. I recognize the spiritual disciplines are critical to the Christian walk and freely admit I have been falling short and need to grow in multiple areas; I'm not at all excusing my sins. However, it continues to seem like you both are just giving me cold formulaic answers in response to my suffering that are devoid of warmth or grace. I don't believe that is your intention at all, but that is what is landing in my soul. That is where I am at right now, and at the same time I don't know what else to do besides to do more. What else can I do but try harder?”  
  
They responded like this:  
  
Person1: “Hey man, I appreciate your honesty, and I encourage you to never hesitate to send us something like this. We want to hear where you're at and seek to come alongside you. Firstly, I do want to apologize if anything I've ever said to you boiled down to just: do more and your doubt will be gone and God will love you. That is not my intention and is not the reason why I encourage you to pray, be in the word, and fight sin. My goal would be that your doubt would diminish and that your love for God and knowledge of His love for you would increase. But our council should never be: just do more and that will happen. And I think that also goes for Person2 as well. Secondly, I want to encourage you to think about the following question: what is the WHY behind all the things that we encourage you to do? And I'll give you a hint, it's not just so that you'll feel better. It's also not simply the goals I listed above in my first point either. Those are important, but are the results of the WHY. Please think back on all the things that Person2 and I have told you, and consider if there is a portion of it that you might have not considered in the text above. I know I'm being a little vague, but I'm doing so because I want you to reconsider your interpretation of why we've counseled you and our ultimate goal for you.”  
  
Person2: “Indeed! Person1 and I care deeply for you, and out goal is not that you ""feel better"" or that your doubt will be gone for its own sake. We want you to be in the Word and trusting God because He is worth it! Because His Word is true and He can and must be trusted. Any semblance of ""doubt being gone"" is because it's been replaced by a life-giving trust in Jesus' work on your behalf. Any to-dos, or disciplines, or habits we've tried to help build are predicated on the belief that a believer will want to do those things in response to God's grace, but can be distracted by sin and the world and will need help staying on the narrow path.”

I am so frustrated and feel like they still don’t get it at all. I almost want to leave my church and never want to talk to them again. I thought they of all people would be different. Ive known them for years and they are deacons and the people I know the most at my church I have no other ""close fiends"". How can they do this to me after everything I have been through and meeting with both of them for 10 months now. How can they be this tone deaf? Is it just me? Am I interpreting this wrong? I am nearing the end of my rope. I did talk to them in person after that and I know for sure they are not trying to convey the bad tone/message I am interpreting, but everything I am perceiving from them is still far more focused on sin/obedience vs grace/love. Idk. Maybe that really should be the focus. Take what I am saying with several grains of salt I am a doubting, scrupulous, faithless, and unreliable narrator I guess. I’m probably wrong and always am because I’m the worthless sinner here. 

I believe and doubt if I believe, hence lies the problem. I’m so empty and angry. What else can I do but just keep pleading to God until something changes? I’m not living, I’m just listlessly slogging through each meaningless day. I want God to either kill me or let me kill myself. I don’t understand why He wont end my pain. I just want the pain to stop. At this point I am even doubting what I believe at all. Assurance may not even be possible anymore I don’t know. To be frank, if I could commit suicide, I would have done so already. I deeply want to but God prevents me. 

Please help me. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, and by night, but I find no rest.

1ol4iqb,https://i.redd.it/cxufd4sf5iyf1.jpeg,Need opinions on kitchen window size and cabinetry!,"Here’s the layout of my future kitchen but I’m struggling with a few decisions and hope y’all can help! 
A few details: ceilings are 9ft and cabinets will be stacked to the ceiling. Measurements drawn in blue are probably not completely accurate, just general sizing. 

1) window size???? initially it was drawn with upper cabinets that wrap around the corner and then one closer to the sink as well. Ive deleted those and opted to have the cabinets on the stove wall run right to the wall. At the very end facing the sink will be a cabinet to the counter intended to be more styled/decorative. On the left of the sink will be an appliance garage cabinet to the counter. I’m concerned the 6ft window we planned initially will be too small? Or it will look strange with too much empty wall on either side after I removed the cabinets. Should I do a bigger window, and if so, how big? Debating going taller with the window as well to look more proportionate. 
2) If I go with a larger window, is there such a thing as too large for this space?? The window will face north east and out onto the backyard. Behind the house is a road so it’s not overly scenic but I do love natural light. Tell me what size the window should be!
3) I’m open to going back to the original cabinet plan if the general consensus is that it makes things feel more balanced. I don’t particularly need the upper cabinet space though, hence why I was integrating something more decorative. Appliance garage cabinet would act as a coffee station. 

Please let me know what you think. The back wall is quite long and I don’t want it to look strange or disproportionate when all is said and done!

The rattle of a rain wet windshield, the aroma of a roadside filter coffee, the hush of pine leaves when the wind goes quiet; those little noises that get stuck in your head and show up in your playlist years later.

I’m thinking about a very short experiment: a tiny, 10-person weekend in Poondi (Kodai) : mushroom foraging in the morning, a slow forest walk, cooking stuff over flame, nights around a fire where people swap songs and stories. The idea is not “see Kodaikanal,” it’s “collect a few tracks you’ll want to replay.”

Before I go and make it an event, curious to know from folks here in Bengaluru:

1. What single sound from a getaway does your brain replay like a chorus? (No explanations needed just drop the sound or the song.)
2. Do you prefer a weekend that’s planned down to the last chai, or one that’s curated loosely (a few anchors, lots of open space)?
3. If someone offered a tiny, carefully curated 3-day “mixtape” weekend in Kodai in late Nov, would that make you curious?

She's also really cute. I suck socially, especially in crowded areas. Not sure if I should ask her to coffee for example, and how ""out of place"" that might be given she's an employee and I'm a customer. We are around the same age (from first glance it appears so) and haven't spoken much except for a ""hey hi hello"" type situation.

Any advice? On what to do,how to do it, if I should do it, etc. I just don't want to come across strange or do something wrong 😅 I want to be polite and considerate

I needed to show a video from my phone on my PC - easy, right? Wrong. The process of figuring out how to cast iPhone to Windows 10 almost made me throw my laptop across the room. AirPlay, mirroring apps, network settings - it felt like deciphering an alien language.

First things first: yes, it’s possible. But there are a few weird pitfalls you might run into. The most important thing is understanding that your iPhone and Windows 10 machine aren’t naturally best friends. Apple thinks in AirPlay, Microsoft thinks in… well, Windows. They don’t speak the same language out of the box.

Here’s how I eventually got it working:

**Pick a mirroring app** – There are several third-party apps that let your Windows 10 PC receive an AirPlay signal. Some are free, some aren’t. The key is to pick one that actually works and doesn’t bomb out the second you try to play a video. I learned the hard way with a few “promising” apps that crashed immediately.

**Get on the same Wi-Fi, duh** – Your iPhone and Windows 10 PC have to chill on the same network. Sounds obvious, right? But apparently, my brain needed a tutorial. Different bands, guest networks, or random coffee shop Wi-Fi = mirroring nope. Spent 20 minutes yelling at my PC before realizing my iPhone was partying on the guest Wi-Fi. Classic rookie move.

**Launch mirroring and trust your PC** – Open the app on Windows 10 and then use your iPhone’s Control Center → Screen Mirroring. Your PC should pop up. Hit it, and cross your fingers. The first time it actually worked without lag or a black screen felt like a tiny miracle.

Once I got the basics down, it was mostly smooth sailing, but a couple more tips saved me hours of headache:

* Close background apps that hog bandwidth - this is especially true if you’re trying to stream video. I once had a Netflix tab chewing up my Wi-Fi and it made the mirroring stutter like a broken record.  
* Adjust resolution settings in the mirroring app if possible. Some apps try to stream at 1080p by default, which your network might not handle. Dropping to 720p can make a world of difference.  
* Keep your iPhone charged. Mirroring drains battery surprisingly fast, and I’ve seen it shut down mid-stream at the worst moments.  

The wild part? Once it’s set up, casting your iPhone to Windows 10 is kind of magical. Suddenly, you can show videos, apps, or even do a live demo straight from your phone. The first time I mirrored a short video clip to my desktop without lag, I felt like I’d hacked the Matrix.

And yes, I know, this isn’t Apple’s intended ecosystem, and it will never be as smooth as AirPlay to an Apple TV. But for Windows users like me, it’s the best we’ve got, and it actually works. I’ve used it for presentations, showing vacation clips to friends, and even a tiny bit of gaming. Weird flex, but it’s useful.

So guys, what’s your strategy for casting iPhone to Windows 10? Have you found any hacks to make the stream smoother, or is it always a gamble of lag and panic?

Sunday my husband (35M) confessed that he had been having an emotional affair that turned physical with another woman since September and got her pregnant, she has told him she will be taking the abortion pill and he will be witnessing it. The wound is still fresh and very deep, and I’m (32F) obviously still having a lot of emotions. The first few days were very rough with more fights, tears, anger and sadness. Wednesday we met up to try to complete the divorce docs but ended up getting into more arguments and crying, and couldn’t finish them. Then, we just agreed that let’s try to be a cordial as possible. We took a walk together to cool off. The air was crisp and the leaves crunching underneath was grounding. We walked by all the houses with Halloween decorations up, and it was really nice to chat about something else for a while. Yesterday we met at a coffee shop to finish the docs and were very calm the whole time. We spent the whole day together trying to file (we couldn’t because the documents were double sided) and going to the dmv to put the title in my name. We even had lunch together where we just talked and had some pretty deep, honest conversations.

He is currently not in our home and I dropped him off where he is staying. Last night we were talking some more and I mentioned the house was empty and weird and he said, “this might be inappropriate, but I can come over for a little if you want”. He did say that it was just to keep me company and he wouldn’t pressure me into being physical. I told him to pack a bag because I didn’t feel like driving him back. The plan was for him to sleep in the guest room. We had a really good game of Mancala and then ended up just talking about everything for a good hour. He was very open about how he felt and what he thought lead up to the affair. We both agreed that it caulked up to communication issues and some great misunderstandings between us that lead each other to pushing the other away.

Bed time comes and I ask him to just cuddle with me. Well we start to cuddle and I couldn’t resist him. I could tell that he didn’t want to pressure me, so I just went for it. The sex was the most intense sex we’ve ever had; with love,  kisses, sadness, tears, lust and anger all intertwined. This morning I felt as though I should regret it but I didn’t.

Of course I still have a lot of emotions going on but throughout our deep talks and honesty I feel very connected with him. We even prayed together which was new for me, he prays every day and I have started since the A, asking the universe/God for guidance through this. I know we both need to do a lot of self reflection and have a very long road ahead of us. I am still going to go back to my home state for a few months to see if this really is the right decision for me and start therapy. I don’t want to be quick to make a decision and certainly not forgive so soon.",6,1761939960.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,4,0.88,False

It's kinda terrifying, right? Like, I had this cute little side hustle going where I was writing product descriptions for small businesses. Made decent beer money, y'know? But then...BAM! AI can now crank out ten descriptions in the time it takes me to brew a pot of coffee. ☕️

Ouch.

So, I started panicking (naturally). Was I about to become a dinosaur? Obsolete? Am I just gonna wither and… well, you get the picture. Dramatic, I know. But real!

Then I realized... maybe I just need to level up. Embrace the robots, but not *become* one.

That’s when I started thinking about upskilling, *specifically* around AI. It's not about fighting the change, but figuring out how to ride the wave (safely, of course).

Here's my current (very tentative) game plan:

*   **Learn to *prompt* like a boss.** I mean, garbage in, garbage out, right? If I can tell the AI exactly what I need, I can still add my human touch and strategy.
*   **Become a *validator* and editor.** Let AI do the first draft. I'll polish it until it shines and ensure it meets the client's brand voice and strategy.
*   **Focus on *niche* areas.** Generic content? AI can have it. But what about super-specialized stuff that requires deep industry knowledge? That’s where humans can still bring value.

Speaking of leveling up, I stumbled across this thing — it's called [AutomateItPro](https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals) — and it’s all about mastering AI automation. It seems like exactly the kind of practical, hands-on education I desperately need. Has anyone else tried it? Is it legit, or am I about to be scammed? 😂

Honestly, it feels like the only way to survive this AI apocalypse is to become *the* AI whisperer. But what if I fail? What if I just end up even more confused and broke? 😩 Maybe I should just move to a cabin in the woods and raise goats…

Anyone else feeling this existential dread, or is it just me? What are your plans for not getting left behind? Seriously, I'm all ears. Maybe we can all figure this out together.",1,1761939640.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1ol44f4,https://tipstor.com/st-michans-crypts-in-ireland/,St. Michan’s Crypts in Ireland,"Beneath the cobbled streets of Dublin, where the whiskey keeps the lights alive and the rain whispers promises, lies the crypt of St. Michan’s Church. More than five hundred years old, its vaults house mummies, once ordinary Dubliners frozen in time by peat, lime and legend, soldiers whose faces stare forward as though minding unfinished business. The air in the crypt is heavy, damp, faintly sulphurous. Guides flash torches. The creaking vault doors echo like stage cues. This is not a theme park. It’s history with a pulse.

Tourism in Dublin remains robust. The national report by Failte Ireland shows that in 2024 the Dublin region welcomed 4.1 million overseas visitors and 2.8 million domestic trips with revenues near €2.4 billion from the international cohort. The average overnight stay by those overseas was 4.8 nights. While numbers nationally for Ireland’s inbound tourism reached approximately 6.6 million in 2024, a 5 percent increase over 2023 according to the Central Statistics Office, Dublin holds court as the eerie underbelly for travelers who want more than sunshine and selfies. These numbers matter because they keep the lights on, the cafés open, the tour guides spinning stories behind a microphone.

For the traveler seeking the sharpest edge, the best action adventure at St. Michan’s lies in a private after-hours crypt tour when the ambient light goes out and torch beams pick out skeletal faces and lime-worn coffins. Some operators quote rates from about USD 55 for the standard guided crypt visit, though private or late-night versions may run higher. For those comfortable in daylight, the best activities include the regular guided crypt tour of the mummies, climbing the church tower’s steep narrow spiral stairs for panoramic city views, then drifting into local taverns for stout and storytelling. These exhibits become more than stops. They are threads in a Dublin nightscape of beer, myth and mortar.

Timing the visit is about mood and weather, and the best season to travel is autumn, from late September through November, when the light softens, the city pauses between high summer frenzy and holiday build-up, and the crypt tours feel quieter and more potent. Spring, especially April and May, works too with less rain and fewer crowds. Summer brings busier streets and longer daylight which diffuses the atmosphere of the subterranean crypt. Winter can be wet, raw and isolating. Appealing to some, but less accessible for others.

Food and drink in Dublin around St. Michan’s are part of the theatre. After stepping out of the crypt you’ll want to wander to a nearby pub, order a plate of braised beef cheek with stout-and-onion gravy for about USD 28, paired with a pint of local craft stout at roughly USD 7. For breakfast the next day, find a full Irish with crispy rashers, black pudding, and soda bread for about USD 18 in a snug nearby café. Whiskey tastings are available in town for USD 35–USD 50 depending on the venue and pour. The dark stone of the crypt, the bitter pint, the muddy Irish sky. It all fits. The food isn’t padding. It’s fuel for the story.

Logistics are straightforward. The church is centrally located in Dublin, easily accessed from most city hotels. Admission to the regular crypt tour is typically around USD 20–USD 30. One must book ahead for peak times or special tour versions. There are no lavish parking issues here. You walk, you drink coffee, you glance at centuries. But dress for dampness and bring your lightest steps. The crypt is old, the floors uneven, the air thick with atmosphere.

The mummies of St. Michan’s crypt are not props. They’re reminders that history’s weight presses down, quietly, imperceptibly, like the drip of water through stone. Dublin offers sunlight and jackpots, but in the vaults beneath its heart you find the dark edge, the story that doesn’t wait for clarity or comfort. Travel here for the twist. Stay for the shudder.

1ol41p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/marella/comments/1ol41p8/just_discovered_marella_at_aviator_nation/,Just discovered Marella at Aviator Nation Dreamland (TW: Emotional),"My boyfriend took me out to Aviator Nation Dreamland a few weeks ago for our three year anniversary. 

It was in the middle of the week so I didn't think there would be much of a crowd there. For those of you who have never been to dreamland in Malibu, it's a pretty small venue. We love their atmosphere and we live in thousand oaks, so the drive isn't too bad and it's slowly become our favorite spot to frequent. 

Most of the bands there, admittedly, are not my favorite. The music just doesn't fit the vibe of the place. My boyfriend likes a lot of the bands, but I hate them. He's very into the type of techno and screamo where you can't really hear the nuance of the music or lyrics. To me it's just loud noise and I usually leave with a headache. 

  
We got in a fight on the way over because I told him how, even though I love dreamland, I wish he would take me some place with music I like, especially for our anniversary. He said it's impossible to find any live music I like because I'm ""too sensitive to noise"" and that it's ""so hard to please me sometimes"". 

I responded by letting him know that I'd be a much more agreeable girlfriend if he were able to give me any signal of a long term possibility between us. For context, he was laid off recently (totally fine!) and he decided to take it as an opportunity to pursue twitch streaming. I was very supportive at first, but his severance checks ran out over a month ago and I've been having to support us, doubling my shifts as a dog walker between wag and rover.

He's convinced fortnite is going to pick up traction again like it did during covid, and has been dming this guy known as ninja nonstop trying to ""collab"". It just feels like we're going in a backwards direction to me. My previous boyfriend was an architect. He had pretty consistent work around town and I always thought it was cool to see his drawings and sketches come to life. 

For the record, I NEVER bring him up to my new bf. I'm only mentioning this because my boyfriend has become obsessed with comparing his ""builds"" on fortnite to the literal buildings my ex used to design. 

I'll come home all sweaty and beaten after skillfully exercising a newfoundland, golden retriever, doberman, and pomeranian on only TWO leashes, and he'll rush me over to show off the stone castle he built on ""creative mode"" with his Harley Quinn character. I try my best to act excited, but he gets so upset if I don't say the exact right thing and then he'll shut down completely for the rest of the day. 

The week before the concert, I mentioned to him that I might start a savings account with my extra money from this new family I had started walking for (french bulldog, border collie, and an afghan hound $$$$$) and put it towards a wedding fund. He became super defensive and asked why I didn't think he was capable of taking care of us. It was super uncomfy and I didn't know how to react. 

When he brought up going to dreamland for our anniversary a few days later, I was a little upset because the band he mentioned was playing isn't really my style. When we walked into the venue, though, he immediately looked around all confused and started walking up to the event staff and whispering in their ears. I could tell he looked really panicked and annoyed. I came over, grabbed his arm, and asked if everything was ok. 

  
He shook me off pretty hard and told me that it wasn't actually one of his favorite artists that was playing (Madvilla) but really this alt rock band (Marella).  I laughed and said that it was such a hilarious mix up, but he did not find it funny whatsoever. 

""I was going to propose to you tonight, and now it's ruined."" I was pretty shocked to hear him say this, and immediately felt terrible about how I complained on the way over. I tried to console him, and said that we should give this band a chance. ""They still might be great!"" I said, but he was not listening. 

""I had it all planned out. I was going to propose right at the end of 'SLOPPY TOPPY', our favorite song, right over there in that corner by the couch we sat on for one of our first dates. This is a fucking nightmare."" I wanted to keep reassuring him, but it really bothered me that he called SLOPPY TOPPY ""our favorite song"". I hate Madvilla and have told him this on several occasions. I walked away, went into one of the stalls, and started to cry. There were already so many emotions going on inside of me, and then Marella began to play. 

The music was so smooth and the guitars were playing so well together. The lead singer's voice reminded me of the early 2000s music I loved listening to in high school. I ran over to my boyfriend and asked him to go dance with me, but he suggested we leave. I told him I wanted to stay and keep listening, and that I really liked the romantic lyrics. I tried to convince him this could still be a magical night, but he just kept muttering to himself about Madvilla and SLOPPY TOPPY. 

It was the most incredible concert I had ever experienced. I was genuinely moved to tears by some of these songs. I stayed by my boyfriends side at the bar away from the crowd the whole time, but at the end of the concert, they did a cover of ""Sex on Fire"" by Kings of Leon, and everybody began to go nuts for it. 

The singer's voice made for such a perfect cover of the song, and I urged my boyfriend once more to go dance with me. Again, he refused to budge, so I left him and beelined towards the stage.  

  
By the second chorus, I had ingratiated myself among the sea of screaming co eds, and was singing along to the lyrics right beneath the gaze of their lead singer. I was so close that the sweat from his forearms actually began to drip down onto me, but I was having such a great time, I didn't mind it. 

When the concert ended, I turned and walked back to my boyfriend, who was sulking at the bar. He looked at me with disgust and said ""Why the fuck is your hair so wet? It looks like you just got out of the shower."" I didn't justify him with a response. I told him I wanted to wait for the band to pack up and then go tell them what a great job they did. 

He instantly became irate about this and told me I had to leave with him right away, and that we couldn't stay any longer. He was my only way back home, so I begrudgingly got into his blue hyundai sonata. Once we pulled out of the lot and got on the 101, he immediately started playing Venus and Bacchus by Saetia at max volume. I asked him to turn it down but he just kept telling me ""you didn't mind the noise when you were yelling 'your sex is on fire' right under that dude's gyrating crotch!""The song played on repeat the entire way back.

When we walked inside the house, he budged me to the side, rushed in front of me into our bedroom, unplugged his pc setup, put it on his Arozzi Vernazza gaming chair, and wheeled it out into the living room. 

For the rest of the night, he played videogames with Saetia playing on two separate jbl flips. He slept on the couch and in the morning, when I came out to the kitchen, he had already left. He texted ""going to stay with Alistair for awhile. don't think i can do this anymore.""

I decided to cancel all of my rover and wag appointments for the day, went over to the couch, connected to one of his jbl flips on the coffee table, followed Marella on spotify, and just listened to their entire discography on repeat while I cried the whole morning. 

I may have lost a fiancé, but Marella gained a fan for life.

I recently turned 35 and its hard to meet people and maintain friendships when life gets busy. Im looking to meet people and maybe make a new friend.  We can trade TikToks, new song discoveries, laugh at the impending doom of the incontinental divider, plan gaming sessions or even the mundane of our daily lives.  I’m a pretty big nerd with a wide range of hobbies, so there’s a good chance we’ll click over something. Here's a bit about me:

🍳 Food lover – I enjoy cooking and trying new dishes. Let’s trade recipe recs

🎮 Gamer – currently hooked on Marvel Rivals. Recent favorites include BG3, OW2, and Fortnite.

📚 Reader – Mostly sci-fi and fantasy. Currently deep into Dungeon Crawler Carl. Let's talk about our favorite books we read this year.  

🎧 Music - I'm no music buff but I do enjoy going to the occasional show.  I generally enjoy different types of rock ( metalcore, alternative,  psychedelic) and funky electronic music.  I recently saw Sleep Token live and it was amazing.   

🌲 Outdoors stuff – I love hiking with our two huskies, foraging, and just started learning pickleball (I’m still terrible, but it’s fun).

🍻☕ Brews – I’m a craft beer and coffee snob

🐕Pets- I love animals but dogs are my favorite. my partner and I have 2 fur babies. If you have pets please share 

👬 I’m a gay man in a relationship—just looking for an online friend to talk about life, share recipes, tik toks and potentially game. In the chance someone local (WI)  reaches out, maybe we could grab a drink.

A little background about me: I’m a 27F (Filipina) who’s never been in a relationship. At this point, I had honestly given up on love. I deleted dating apps and just started enjoying my single life — traveling, spending time with friends, and focusing on myself.

Then I met this guy (Canadian, 24M). I work as a flight attendant, and he’s a pilot. We briefly worked together last year, but it wasn’t until earlier this year that we really met, he was traveling as a passenger on one of my flights. After that, we followed each other on Instagram. I didn’t think much of it; he had a lot of flight attendant friends, so I figured it was harmless.

Over time, he started liking my photos and reacting to my stories, but we never had any deep conversations, just random exchanges. Then one morning in August, he randomly asked me out for coffee. I said yes. We had a great time, which led to another lunch date, a driving range date, and then he told me he liked me.

Things moved quickly from there. We went out a few more times, started talking every day, and by the end of the month, he told me he wanted a relationship. We had dinner at his place, and that night he officially asked me to be his girlfriend. Looking back, everything happened fast, but he was the one who insisted he wanted something serious — that he was a committed guy. He was kind and seemed genuine; even people at work said the same. He didn’t have the typical “pilot attitude” when it came to casual dating or hookups. He made it clear he wanted a relationship and was ready for commitment. We even talked about going public and telling our family and friends about us. 

Come October, we both got busy and started having a hard time seeing each other. We still tried, but his schedule was always packed: work, family, friends. Earlier this week, I told him that I’d been feeling like he was treating me more like an appointment than a girlfriend. I understood he was busy, but I couldn’t ignore how distant things were feeling. He said he’d do better, so I tried to brush it off.

Then today, everything fell apart. I woke up and sent him a text message checking in (we are both on a layover). 

He told me that the relationship had been stressful for him and that he felt like he was stretching himself too thin. He said the pressure of working for the same company was too much and that he couldn’t keep feeling this way. Then he told me he didn’t think it was going to work out — that he didn’t want to string me along and wanted to be honest with me. And that was it.

It hurts because it all felt real. He was the one who pursued me, reassured me, and said he was serious, only to walk away when things got a little heavy. I told him I found it a little unfair since we had talked about this before and I thought we were okay with it. I still told him I wanted to work on things, but that I’d give him whatever space he needed. He didn’t change his mind.

Now I’m left feeling confused, hurt, and wondering if what we had was ever real. He did say that it was real for him, but that he realized he wasn’t actually ready to jump into another relationship (his last one ended three years ago). Still, it feels like I got hit with the classic “it’s not you, it’s me.”

I know two months isn’t that long, but it hurts more than I expected. I really thought I found someone genuine, someone who saw me for who I am. I keep replaying everything in my head. It’s hard to accept that it’s suddenly over. 

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest, because right now, it feels like I’m mourning something that never got the chance to grow.

She's also really cute. 
I suck socially, especially in crowded areas. Not sure if I should ask her to coffee for example, and how ""out of place"" that might be given she's an employee and I'm a customer. We are around the same age (from first glance it appears so) and haven't spoken much except for a ""hey hi hello"" type situation. 

Any advice? On what to do,how to do it, if I should do it, etc. I just don't want to come across strange or do something wrong 😅 I want to be polite and considerate

Ever feel like you’re constantly striving, pushing, and dreaming big, but sometimes get caught in the undertow of overwhelm or self-doubt? We’ve all been there. It’s that moment when your ambitious goals feel miles away, or the daily grind just seems to dim your spark. You're here because you believe in growth, in turning those dreams into tangible realities, and in the power of connection. And today, I want to share a little secret that's helped countless individuals, including myself, reclaim their focus and fuel their journey: **The 5-Minute Mindset Reset.** 🚀

Yes, just five minutes. That’s all it takes to radically shift your perspective, calm the noise, and align yourself with the incredible potential that lies within you. This isn't just about ticking off a task; it's about intentionally wiring your brain for success, gratitude, and forward momentum. Let's dive into how to make these five minutes your most powerful investment of the day.

---

### Your Daily 5-Minute Mindset Reset: Unlocking Your Best Self

Here’s how to harness this incredibly simple, yet profoundly impactful, daily habit:

**1. Minute 1-2: The Gratitude Burst ☀️**
Start by taking a deep breath and genuinely reflecting on **three specific things you are grateful for right now.** It doesn't have to be monumental. Maybe it's the warm cup of coffee in your hand, a quiet moment before the day begins, a message from a friend, or simply the ability to read this post. The magic here isn't just naming things; it's *feeling* the gratitude. This practice immediately pulls you out of a scarcity mindset and into one of abundance, reminding you of the good already present in your life. It’s like hitting the refresh button on your emotional state, making room for positivity. For instance, instead of ""I'm grateful for my health,"" try ""I'm grateful my legs allowed me to walk around the block this morning, feeling the cool air."" Specificity amplifies the feeling!

**2. Minute 3-4: Envision Your Smallest Victory ✨**
Now, shift your focus to the day ahead. Instead of overwhelming yourself with the entire to-do list, identify **one tiny, achievable ""win"" you want to accomplish today.** Then, spend these two minutes vividly imagining yourself successfully completing it. See yourself doing it, feel the satisfaction of checking it off. This isn't about wishful thinking; it’s about priming your brain. By mentally rehearsing even the smallest success – like responding to that one email, taking a 10-minute walk, or dedicating focused time to a specific task – you’re building confidence and creating a mental roadmap for achievement. I used to dread starting my bigger projects, but by just visualizing sending that first draft, or even just opening the file, it removed a huge mental block for me. It makes the mountain feel like a molehill you can easily step over.

**3. Minute 5: Set Your Intention & Affirm Your Power 💪**
In your final minute, solidify your plan. State your chosen ""small win"" (from minute 3-4) as an intention: ""Today, I will [your small win] because it aligns with my goal of [bigger goal]."" Then, choose one powerful affirmation that resonates with you and repeat it silently or aloud. ""I am capable,"" ""I am resilient,"" ""I am making progress,"" ""I am worthy of my dreams."" This isn't just positive self-talk; it's a declaration. It cements your focus and reminds you of your inherent strength. This moment is about stepping into your power and carrying that energy with you into whatever comes next.

---

### Why This Works (And Why Consistency is Key) 🕰️

This 5-minute habit isn't about avoiding challenges; it's about equipping you to face them with a better mindset. By consistently starting your day (or resetting your afternoon) with gratitude, focused visualization, and clear intention, you're training your brain to seek opportunities, manage stress more effectively, and believe in your own capacity to achieve. It transforms the daunting into the doable, one small, powerful mental shift at a time. It’s the difference between reactive living and intentional thriving.

You're already here in Empowish, striving for more. This simple habit is your daily nudge, your gentle reminder that every grand journey is made of consistent, small steps. Let's celebrate those tiny victories, because they are the foundation upon which your biggest dreams are built!

**Now, I'd love to hear from you, Empowish!** ✨

1ol3qgv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ol3qgv,Thoughts after visiting a bunch of cat cafes in Japan,"Cafe Mocha runs an established chain of cat cafes all across Japan. I know there’s some skepticism about the practice as a whole, but my own experience and conversations with many of their compassionate employees led me to believe that they care deeply about the well-being of their feline pals and sustain their business as ethically as possible.

Many positive signs included tidy, scentless facilities with lots of toys. Employees ran lint rollers and regularly groomed and trimmed each cat while reassuring them in a soothing voice. Shiny coats and clean nails for all. The relaxed temperament of the cats seemed to reflect their sense of ownership of the space—I’ve visited other franchises with lingering odors of pee accidents from thinning, skittish cats that fought over kibble. It was a slightly heartbreaking scene, but rest assured Cafe Mocha lay far on the opposite spectrum. Really made me realize that cats are the reflection of the home you provide.

Other reassuring guardrails were the enforcement of no chasing after or picking up the cats, no flash photography, and the requirement of adult supervision for children (although things could get a tad rowdy when a parent brings a gang of four, five kids). Certain locations would open applications to seek forever homes for those ready to “graduate” from their cafe. The adopters’ anonymity remained protected, as some of the stars had amassed quite a following.

Other non-cat related perks were unlimited drinks (soda, juice, coffee, tea, water, even soup), all-you-can-read manga, board games, free wifi, charging cables, and a Nintendo Switch at some spots. Gacha machines containing Churu capsules and specialty kitty treats like iced lollipops could be purchased as extras. The staff could kind of get by on basic English, but please don’t take their efforts for granted and appreciate that they are trying very hard to make the place just as welcoming for non-Japanese speaking visitors.

Overall, I highly recommend Cafe Mocha as a joyful cat-filled respite for anyone roaming through Japan. I left each cat’s name and location in the comments. Enjoy the view, and feel free to ask any questions 👋😺",8,1761938515.0,cats,1,1.0,False
1ol3q02,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ol3q02,Review : Blur india perfume,"I read one review on here about how they did a blind buy of these Blur India Perfumes - Cookie Crumble and liked them even though people aren't fans of their makeup products on here. 

 I've personally never bought anything from them or Bella Vita ever but the review made me curious so I decided to get their combo of 3 scents at 999.

Now, I went into this with 0 expectations to begin with because of what all I read but I once I tried cookie crumble and coffee cake, I was beyond impressed. And I'm not just saying that because I spent money, I'm a professional hater. At this price point, I can't even lie, the perfumes are pretty damn good. I'll go into a deeper review-

Coffee cake is the one that absolutely took my heart. Well yeah it doesn't smell anything like coffee on the top notes, it's more cardamom and ginger heavy, more like a cinnamon latte. The dry down does have slight black coffee and vanilla. I don't think i will have the exact words to describe this scent, but it's very wintery Christmassy, VERY VERY gingerbread man-esque and I LOVED IT.

Second was coffee cake that I read about in the original review which described it as ""Cookie Crumble sits much closer to Plum Vanilla Caramello and Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 62. warm, nutty, and slightly more floral and fresh but with very delectable and almost the same dry down😍"" and I 100% agree.  It's like caramelo with a better lasting power and a floral freshness to it. I loved it for layering it with my goddess intense, it just brings out the vanilla beautifully. 

Vanilla melts is the last scent I tried tbh not a fan. Like it's a been there done that kinda vanilla scent. The dry down is good no doubt, but maybe I prefer scents with more intricate notes. It's a mix of woody vanilla and sandalwood, and supposedly exactly like kayali vanilla 28 (i have not smelled it so idk)

Overally I'd review 4/5 for the notes and the oils definitely do not smell synthetic which is a plus. 5/5 for the packaging and i personally LOVED the design. 3.5/5 for performance in terms of projection and longevity. It's honestly a good buy if you're looking for casual everyday scent. Hope the review helps ✌",3,1761938483.0,indianbeautyhauls,1,1.0,False

I've been friends with everyone but never had my own close group and even when i did, i'd be left out in the end or never chosen as the close friend. I'm not sure what i'm doing wrong.. I've always believed that in life, you should be part of the village you'd want for yourself when you need people. But even though i try to be there, even then, it feels like i'm just a bother or forcing myself onto the group. In group settings, when help is needed, i've unconsciously developed the habit of staying back and asking for directions instead of just going for it because i don't want to do things the wrong way and inconvenience everyone (has happened before and it still embarasses me). So i don't know if i just end up as a burden instead. I love to help, i want to be there at all times for my friends and i'd do anything for them. 
It hurts to know that even on my wedding day, i don't know if i'd have any bridesmaids at all. 

And at this point in life, most people have already found their people. It's like i can only join groups but i u consciously know, that it will not last, as they know each other on a whole different level already. I still try my best to belong and when i know they meet up without me, i tell myself that i shouldn't be jealous because they have been closer than i will ever be to them. 

Two years ago, i thought i had found a group i could call my closest friends. To me, they are. But finding out over text message, that you're invited to the wedding a day prior and after calling a mutual friend, knowing that they have been shopping with her and prepping together for weeks and sleeping over, and you're just not part of it, was a reminder again, that i'm not wanted. I was genuinely shocked because we were on a trip together a month prior and nothing seemed out of the ordinary and we hadn't seen each other since..I had asked her later to let me know when she has time between uni and work to go for coffee and it just didn't happen.
I asked the mutual, if i had done anything wrong so i could apologize (i didn't want to stress the bride over this) and they told me, that it's nothing personal at all and that she is just stressed.. 
But it seems very personal. I overestimated my importance in her life and i'm genuinely embarassed. And i don't even know if i have the right to feel sad, because it must be my own fault that this happened to me. 

How do i deal with these feelings?
How do i show up tomorrow and not feel like a burden or unwanted in the room? ",2,1761937941.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Lucy 

Today has to be the day. I refuse to believe it won’t be. I’m putting it out into the universe, calling to the Mother of Witches that *today* will be the day.

Lying in bed, I can hear Luna pottering around the kitchen, singing along to Chappell Roan as she makes breakfast for me and Lily. The smell of eggs and toast drifts into my small bedroom, but I can’t bring myself to open my eyes.

Twenty-one. I’ve made it to twenty-one and still not a twinge of power in me. Even my baby sister has hers, she’s just started at university to hone her innate witchcraft and they wouldn’t even sniff in my direction. The Wood family is supposed to be full of powerful witches, leaders of the magical world. And then there’s me: the dud, the failure.

So much for positive thinking my way into power. 

The warmth of the sun creeps in through the window, telling me there’s no hiding anymore. I have to get up and face the day.  
I roll out of bed with a groan just as “Good Luck, Babe” starts to play, almost mocking me. Stretching, I glance around my room; it’s long overdue for a makeover. My reflection in the vanity mirror doesn’t help much either. There are faint bags under my eyes from too many late nights, and my hair’s grown too long for me to cope with anymore. I’ve always been the biggest of my sisters, all soft and squidgy, but I like that about myself. I always say my body’s built to handle things; maybe not running, but definitely to weather any storm that comes my way.

I slip on my dressing gown and head down to the kitchen to face the music. Luna is dancing around the kitchen island in just a shirt and pants, red curls bouncing behind her as she moves, flicking her fingers in time to the music. To the untrained eye you wouldn't believe that she was using her magic to make our breakfast: stirring spoons and heating tea. 

All witches have innate magic that gives them the ability to do the basic things, moving things, potion making, sending messages with their mind and so on.  But each witch has a connection to an element. Luna is a powerful fire witch. She is the most powerful during the day when she is able to draw power from the heat of the sun. Luna is the most sensible of the Wood sisters which is a good thing considering she could burn the whole house down. 

Luna spins and jumps when she sees me standing in the doorway at the bottom of the stairs. “Holy Mother!” she pants, clutching her chest. “Give a girl some warning next time, will you?” She flicks her wrist, and the music cuts off. A moment later, she’s plating up breakfast like nothing happened.  
“It’s not my fault you’ve got your music loud enough to raise the dead,” I say, laughing at how far she jumped and how quickly she slipped back into her mother-hen routine. Ever since Mum and Dad left on their adventures in the Fairy Forest, Luna’s made it her mission to take care of everyone and everything. “Is Lily up yet?”  
“Nope. She came in late, and I didn’t want to wake her, so I put a silencing charm on her room.” She joins me at the table with two steaming cups of coffee.  
“Didn’t want to extend the same courtesy to me on my birthday, then?” I try to keep it light, but the words land heavier than I intend. Luna freezes, eyes wide.  
“Shit. I’m sorry, Luc! I completely forgot, with taking over the shop and Lily starting uni, it just slipped my mind.” I can tell she means it, but that doesn’t make it hurt any less. Just because I don’t have any power, and didn’t get to go to the Thorne Institute, doesn’t mean I’m invisible. I wrap my hands around the mug, holding it tight enough that the heat starts to sting. I’m already fighting my own demons, I don’t need them added to the list.

Luna flicks her wrist, I assume to break the silencing charm on Lily’s room.

“Lillian Morgan Wood! Get down here, now!” she shouts, loud enough to make me wince. She must have used magic to amplify her voice.

A crash from above signals that Lily’s fallen out of bed in fright. I can’t help but smirk as I dig into my breakfast, might as well enjoy my birthday meal, even if it wasn’t *meant* to be one.

A few moments later, Lily stumbles down the stairs, still half asleep. As the youngest of the Wood sisters, she’s just entering her wild phase, freshly eighteen, starting university, new powers... and loving every second of it.

Her thick blonde hair is tied up in a messy bun on top of her head, and an oversized T-shirt drowns her tiny frame. She rubs at her sky-blue eyes, blinking blearily. Lily’s always been the pretty one, the kind of beauty that makes people stare in shop windows. If she were taller, she could’ve been a model, but she got Mum’s height, a grand total of five foot five.

She’s a water witch, drawing her strength from any nearby lake or river. She’s still new to it all, but her tutors say she’s smart and creative and that by the end of her studies, she’ll be one of the most powerful of her generation. That is if she can keep focused and doesn't spend every night partying like she seems to be doing at the moment. 

  
“What the hell, Luna? It’s Saturday, am I not allowed to sleep in on a weekend?” Lily grumbles as she shuffles over to the kettle. She turns to face us, leaning against the counter and yawning. “Happy birthday, Lucy,” she adds with a smirk.

Luna’s jaw drops, her eyes wide. “How the hell did you remember?” she demands, the annoyance obvious in her tone. “And why didn’t you remind me?”

“Some of us pay attention to what’s going on around us,” Lily says sweetly, “and aren’t completely obsessed with work.” The dig is deliberate, as the youngest, winding up our eldest sister is basically her hobby.

She finishes making her tea, pulls a small box from the drawer, and joins us at the table.

I smile at her, at least *someone* remembered.

“So what did you get me?” I ask, taking a sip from my mug, keeping eye contact.

Lily’s grin widens as she slides the box across the table. It’s small, wooden, and carved with twisting vines and leaves. I take it carefully and open the lid. Inside lies a gold necklace with a bloodstone pendant, deep green streaked with tiny flecks of red.

“It’s beautiful,” I whisper. Bloodstone, the crystal for resilience and courage. Typical Lily.

A small smile tugs at my lips. She’s always believed in crystals and their intentions. I’m not sure I do, if they really worked, I’d have my power by now, with the number my family’s given me to ‘draw out my inner magic.’

It was honestly one of the best first dates I've had in a long time — real butterflies. We talked about deep stuff, laughed a ton, and just clicked. She was quirky in a really charming way. We talked about ourselves, family, and friends. 

We grabbed a couple beers, walked around, and ended up at Starbucks. I got a coffee, she didn’t. While we were sitting there, I noticed a bug crawling on her shoulder, brushed it off, stepped on it, and cleaned it up. She smiled at me like she couldn’t decide if it was awkward or sweet, and we kept talking.

It was cold outside so she asked me if she could  sit close to me on a bench. I said, ""Sure."" She cuddled we up next to me and I put my arm around her and rubbed her arm. After a couple of minutes she leaned back out and faced me. She continued the conversation  touching my knee on occasion, and saying she was going over her friends after to talk about how things went tonight.  When we got to her car, I opened the door, I kissed her few times,  and I got her number. She said, ""Make sure you wend me yours."" I said, ""I will..promise😉"" and gave her a quick kiss. She joked I tasted like coffee. I drove away thinking, “Wow, that chemistry was amazing. I really liked her!"" 

I texted to make sure she got home, and she replied: “I did. Thanks so much for your time tonight. It was nice meeting you.” Which threw me off — sounded like a polite goodbye. I kept my response simple, and didn’t get a reply this morning. It was a great date and things got close fast, so maybe I’m overthinking and she’s waiting for the next move… or maybe she got spooked. Either way, I’m trying not to read too much into it yet. But, historically when I get the ""it was nice meeting you."" Text..thats a subtle way of saying I'm not continuing.

Personally, I picked Coupe for one MAJOR reason: Sonar for sure knows Robert’s identity as Mecha Man. There’s no way he doesn’t. He was in the break room when Robert and Invisigal were fighting. He’s a bat meaning he has great hearing and not paying attention as an excuse is off the table because of the way his eyes widened when Robert called her a selfish asshole. 

My theory? Sonar was trying to cover for them both in a way. I believe his screeches at the beginning of the argument were a way to pull their attention away from each other, but it inadvertently made Robert more aggravated. I don’t recall ever him doing those screeches out of the blue outside this specific scene when walking around the SDN offices. When he saw the argument was gonna escalate anyway, he used the coffee grinder to try and dampen the argument from outside ears. 

Of course that theory is speculation bordering on tinfoil hat conspiracy, but the fact of the matter is, Robert was careless in hiding his identity as he’s been known to be with not noticing Waterboy knowing his identity, and said things that would allude to him being Mecha Man. To be fair, Invisigal did too. Sonar was in the room when those things were said. He HAS to know. I feel like people who cut Sonar are gonna get bit in the ass bad later down the line, when stakes are higher and Mecha Man’s true identity becomes more important. Hell, even now. Mal already hates Robert’s guts if you cut Sonar. It’d also be very easy for Sonar to give Flambae a call and tell them the same person who threw spaghetti/a protein shake at him is the same exact person who knocked his tooth out/singed his eyebrows. Sonar wasn’t at the bar, but I doubt the members there that night didn’t let the rest of the Z team know why Flambae was suddenly missing a tooth or eyebrows.

1ol37jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LookOutsideGame/comments/1ol37jm/the_perfect_first_day_on_cursed_mode/,The perfect first day on Cursed Mode?,"So, here's the breakdown of what a ""perfect"" first day for a Cursed Mode run should be, at least in my opinion:

Step 1: Play Super Jumplad twice, learning Super Jump. Grab the first aid kit in the bathroom, and talk to and water the plant in Sam's bedroom.

Step 1a: If an Door Encounter happens, go through with it, thought I doubt there's anything too useful you can grab this early in the game. If it's a recruitable Companion, restart from a fresh save.

Step 2: Navigate to Apartment 37 (Vincent's Apartment), and grab the Carving Fork. Equip the Carving Fork, and attack Vincent, using Super Jump twice (or three times if required) to slay him. Equip the Polo Shirt.

Step 3: Go to Apartment 36, grab the Baseball Bat and the cash on the table, then go fight the Wounded Man. Guard until he transforms into his final form. On turns when his eyes are open, hit him with a Jump Attack, otherwise, Guard. Grab the Padlock Key and the Kitchen Knife

Step 4: Swap to the Baseball Bat and start killing the Onlookers. Single Onlookers should be allowed to progress to their Gawker or Witness stage to farm as much XP and coins as possible, while the fights with multiple Onlookers should be completed as soon as possible by swapping to the Carving Fork and using Super Jump. Whenever your HP and STM get low, use scavenged items to heal up to at least 40%, and never let your STM drop below 4 if possible. The Gawker in Apartment 37's bathroom should be dispatched as quickly as possible. Use the Small Key to open the safe in Apartment 36 for some cash and coins. Hopefully you'll have 100$ at this point.

Step 5: Once the third floor is fully cleared, head back to Apartment 33, since your Danger Meter should have hit the threshold to save your game. Cook a meal (not a Frozen Dinner or Pizza Bites, they don't give any Cooking XP!) to recover your HP and STM. Sam should have leveled enough to have more than 24 STM. Save with Sybil, then go unlock the Padlock at the staircase.

Step 6: Go to the bottom of the staircase, pick up the Pool Cue, then head back to the Second Floor. Reach the blockade, and grab Apartment 21's key, then get ready to get lucky. Fight off the Grinning Beast, using the Pool Cue's Impale skill to kill it quickly. This might require some luck to achieve, but thankfully you just saved not too long ago! Defeat the Grinning Beast, and recruit your first companion, purchasing the pistol off of them for 100$.

Step 7: Talk to the cultist-looking fellow in the hallway of the second floor, then go check out Apartment 20 for a side quest from the person in a trench coat and some more loot, along with a sneaky little passenger found in the bathroom. Unlock Apartment 21, talk to it's inhabitant and start their side quest, too, and loot the main room, specifically for the crossword puzzles on the coffee table.

Step 8: You should have filled the Danger Meter up enough to save once more, so head back to Apartment 33. If everything went right, it should still be late in the evening of the first day. Cook another meal and don't eat it, take a shower, and brush your teeth. Save with Sybil.

From here, you can either go to sleep for the night, progressing to the early hours of Day 2, or you can continue through the night, Getting through to the First Floor via Apartment 21, and unlocking the Ground Floor by solving its (the First Floor's) puzzles.

In either case you'll have:

\- Cleared out all of Apartment 36 and most of Apartment 37, as well as the initial areas on the third floor, the second floor, and the staircase. The early rush means you'll have gained access to Eugene's Shop in Apartment 24 as of Day 2 on the second floor.

\- Your first companion available as early as possible, and the tactical utility of having a firearm at an early point in the game. You can choose to only keep that one companion to unlock another one on the ground floor if you plan out your route well, attaining them early in the run instead of near the very end of exploring the entirety of the apartment complex.

\- A save file set up to farm Door Encounters for Day 2, and can immediately save upon waking up (on a different save file!) to keep whichever saves you want, and can use the Crossword Puzzles to time when the Door Encounters for the day will be, allowing for some quick and dirty setup for exploring the first floor and still keeping door encounters.

I’m organizing a few small caravans down the Baja peninsula this winter and wanted to see if anyone else here is planning the same.

Over the past few years I’ve spent a lot of time exploring Baja as I took my van from the US to Argentina... Baja California became my favorite part of the Pan-American route. This season, I’m helping a small group of overlanders (vans, truck campers, 4x4s) make the trip together for a mix of safety, logistics, and community.

It’s not a big commercial tour or anything.. just a few rigs traveling together, sharing camp spots, tacos, and morning coffee by the ocean. We’ll be starting in San Diego, crossing the border together, and working our way down and then back up to San Diego over a span of 21 days.

If you’re in the U.S. or Canada and have been thinking about heading to Mexico but feel unsure about the border, roads, or travel logistics, you’re definitely not alone. Happy to share my route notes, favorite camping spots, or help with crossing info if that’s useful.

Drop a comment or DM if you’re thinking about heading down or interested in knowing more. Would be cool to connect. Life's better in a caravan!

The problem I'm having is that I feel I give a lot to our friendship but it is not reciprocated. For example, A went through a break up and I was supportive the entire time and kept my opinions of her partner to myself. However, in my last couple relationships she never has anything nice to say about them and now I feel like I can't share that part of my life with her anymore. Along the same lines, when she's going through a hard time I call to check up on her, offer to visit and she always declines. When I need support, she's nowhere to be found. When I initiate plans, I offer to hang out at one of our places or go to dinner or get coffee. When she initiates plans it's usually something related to her and her sibling's career path (think nightlife) and they need people to fill up the space. There's lots of little things but the latest two big examples are, 1) to give her something to put her energy towards, I asked her to plan a Halloween outing for us either the weekend before or after, not the day of. She didn't do it and instead kept trying to insist on an event a peer is hosting on the 31st. Since i didn't want to do that she made other plans without me. 2) I needed a favor to deliver a package to a mutual friend. She offered to take it but when I tried to coordinate drop off of said package she was flaky and dismissive. I have since decided to mail it. Overall, it's hard to make friends as an adult but I'm starting to think this friendship isn't worth it and I'm thinking of slowly phasing out of this friendship by not calling or making plans.

So currently Ive been feeling a really bad anxiety attack and I genuinely don’t understand where this feeling is coming from. Ive never struggled with random anxiety attacks before and Im 26 years old. Ive recently been trying to cut down on drinking because the amounts I was drinking were alot and I made an effort to add more dry days in. At the same time Ive been experiencing really bad head pressure. One morning after I woke up after a dry day I had a really bad panic attack since I was feeling really lightheaded and went to the ER because I genuinely didnt know what was going on. I told the nurses that I think my anxiety is due to alcohol withdrawal and they treated me for that. I assumed it was alcohol withdrawal because besides drinking Im pretty healthy so I assumed that was the only thing wrong with me. 

The head pressure and anxiety came back the next day and I would constantly feel lightheaded throughout the day. After a few weeks of this I went to the clinic because I thought maybe the head pressure was a sinus infection. I took anti-biotics because I was told my sinuses were inflammed. I felt better after that and didnt have anxiety or head pressure anymore.

Fast forward to today, I had a night out drinking with friends then this morning I woke up fine and had some coffee and then a bloom energy drink and noticed I started feeling weird and tried to workout but felt so lightheaded again I had to stop.  Now Im confused where my anxiety really is coming from because last week I was able to go without drinking for the week and the week prior I was fine incorporating more dry days and didnt feel weird at all. Should I just see a doctor and is it possible to just develope anxiety? I feel like my anxiety is stemming from not knowing what feels off about my body. Im calming down a bit now because I had a xanax.",1,1761936888.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1ol2thp,https://i.redd.it/5vsnp249thyf1.jpeg,LOOKING FOR: I WORE HIS VISION I SAW HIS DECEIT,"I Wore His Vision, I Saw His Deceit

Chapter 1
Back when Maurice Clifford was head over heels for me, he donated one of his own corneas to me.
For ten years, through thick and thin, I'd helped him secure his spot as the leader of both the legitimate and underground worlds in Seattle.
He showered me with love and respect.
That lasted until his new young mistress, Daphne Rodd, showed up at my door with a baby bump to provoke me.
""You're Mr. Clifford's ex-wife, right?
""I heard you slept around and wrecked your health, so he dumped you.
""I'm not like you. I've never been with any man but Mr. Clifford. He says I'm his one true love, like a white tulip. And you? You're not pure.""
I seized her by the throat and shoved her down, submerging her entirely in the pool's freezing water.
Watching her writhe in pain as the cold made her miscarry, I chuckled, ""Did Maurice tell you I'm a crazy woman?""
I pulled her head out of the water.
Daphne choked on the water, her delicate face turning pale from the immersion.
She coughed violently. ""How dare you do this to me? Mr. Clifford will make you pay!""
I looked down and saw a tulip tattoo on her right shoulder, visible through the wet fabric of her shirt.
Maurice had one on his shoulder, too.
That tattoo covered a scar he'd gotten from a machete. Back then, I got kidnapped by his enemies and locked in a warehouse with hundreds of their men.
He'd risked his life, charged in alone, and got slashed with a machete.
Later, he had the scar tattooed over to mean ""unpredictable death and love"".
""Kylie, don't you think this fits us?"" he'd said back then.
He lifted his blood-stained hand and gently brushed my cheek.
I'd never forget how that felt.
I couldn't tell if the heat came from his blood, his touch, or the sincerity in his words.
""We never know when our last day will come. But my love for you is certain until my final breath.""
But now, he'd grown tired of living on the edge. He began to crave something pure—a woman he saw as a white tulip.
In the pool, Daphne was still glaring at me defiantly.
That look was familiar, too. It reminded me of when I was eighteen.
""Kyleigh, just give up! You're an old woman now. Do you actually think you stand a chance against me for Mr. Clifford's heart?
""If you hurt me, you'll pay for it.
""Do you know how much I mean to him?""
Of course, I knew alright.
In the two years since Maurice and I split, he'd had countless women.
But only Daphne had been brought out publicly. He'd proudly told the media she was his girl and warned everyone not to mess with her.
Crossing her meant going against the entire Clifford Group.
The Clifford Group's skyscraper, which had never run ads before, now displayed Daphne's photos on its outer screen 24 hours a day.
It was just as bold and showy as when he'd used a thousand helicopters to fly banners all over Seattle, announcing our relationship to the world.
He'd wanted everyone to know back then, and he wanted everyone to know now.
That was just how Maurice loved someone.
I smiled, but a sting of sadness welled up in my eyes.
""Then why don't you call him to come save you? Or you're afraid that once he sees me, he'll fall for me again and leave you?""
""You..."" Daphne's voice caught, like I'd hit a nerve.
But she quickly put on a smug expression.
""Kyleigh, stop fooling yourself. The Thornfield family is already bankrupt. You're useless to him now.
""You can't even do the one basic thing a woman can—have kids. What makes you think Mr. Clifford would still care about you?
""Your arrogance is just...""
Before she could finish, I grabbed her hair and forced her whole body under the water.
At first, Daphne flailed a bit, but soon she lost the strength to struggle, her body going limp in the pool.
When she stopped breathing, I finally let go and told my people to fish her out.
Her long hair clung to her body like some kind of sea creature—nothing like the sweet, innocent look she had on the big screens.
I should've laughed at how pathetic she looked.
But instead, I just smoothed my short hair, ruffled by the night breeze.
Calmly, I dialed a number I'd memorized over a decade ago.
He hadn't changed it, and I hadn't forgotten it.
""Maurice, your little white tulip is with me. Come and get her.""
Chapter 2
The moment the call connected, I clearly heard Maurice's heavy breathing.
""Kyleigh Thornfield.""
It had been two years since I'd heard my name from his lips.
Now it came with a cold, unfamiliar tone of accusation. ""What did you do to Daphy?""
""Oh, her..."" I casually kicked Daphne, who was unconscious.
My voice carried a lazy hint of amusement. ""A mistress came to provoke me personally. With my temper, what do you think I'd do to her?""
Honestly, Maurice and I knew each other better than anyone else in the world.
I knew his paranoia. And he'd seen how crazy I'd be.
The sound of a shattering glass came from the other end.
Maurice became anxious, as expected.
He took a deep breath, trying to keep his voice steady as he negotiated with me, ""Kyleigh, take your anger out on me. Leave Daphy alone.
""She's just an innocent girl. If she accidentally offended you somehow, just let it go, alright? Don't hold it against her.""
The pool water reflected the cold moonlight and my own expressionless face.
""Too late, Maurice.""
I enunciated each word slowly, ""She's already pissed me off. So, having her pay with her life seems fair, doesn't it?""
A loud bang sounded again on the other end of the phone.
This time, it was the sound of a table flipping over.
I listened calmly, almost able to picture his furious expression.
""Fine, Kyleigh. Kill her if you've got the guts!""
The call ended abruptly.
Less than twenty minutes later, the screech of tires sounded outside the courtyard.
I looked instinctively at the eyes of the man leading the group.
When we were deeply in love, I'd kissed the black eyepatch over his right eye countless times.
It always earned me his fiercer affection.
But now, Maurice's gaze went straight to Daphne, who curled up on the ground.
That familiar look of panic and tenderness in his eyes stung mine.
I laughed, ""Relax. She's still alive. But I'm not sure about that bastard in her belly.""
Maurice's handsome face darkened, but he didn't immediately rush over to pick Daphne up.
Instead, he walked toward me until we were standing barely a pace apart.
""Kyleigh,"" he said, his voice low with an unyielding intensity. ""Explain yourself.""
He held a cold gun barrel against my waist.
I didn't even blink.
""Even if everyone in Seattle thinks we're through, you and I know the truth, don't we, Maurice? We never signed the divorce papers. When your mistress comes to provoke me, do you expect me to offer her coffee?""
Maurice's face stayed blank as he shoved the gun harder against me. ""That doesn't justify touching her.""
A smirk touched my lips. I grabbed the barrel and directed it upward toward my own heart. ""Pull the trigger, Maurice.""
""You think I won't dare?"" His lips twisted into a grimace, the warning in his voice unmistakable. ""Kyleigh, your family is finished. You're not that untouchable heiress of the Thornfield family anymore.
""If you cross me now, who do you have to back you up? Who's left to protect you?""
The air was filled with tension, the metallic hint of blood barely perceptible.
I yanked the dagger I'd buried in his abdomen free and dropped it carelessly on the ground.
""Since you didn't pull the trigger, don't blame me for making the first move. Traitors go to hell. Don't forget that.""
My fingertips brushed the collar of his shirt lightly.
I felt his body stiffen instantly.
Mocking him with my eyes, I slowly wiped the blood from my hands.
I pulled my hand back and told him, ""Maurice, you and your people are all disgusting. I don't want to see any of you again. Get out!""
After speaking, I didn't spare another glance at his suddenly changing expression.
Taking a step back, I put distance between us, my posture detached.
Maurice's fists clenched, his knuckles turning pale.
Just then, Daphne coughed up a mouthful of water and woke up.
The second she saw him, she burst into tears.
""Maury, my stomach hurts so bad. Our baby... Did we lose our baby?"" she sobbed.
""You can't let this bitch get away with it! She has to pay for our baby's life!""
Maurice crouched beside her, his voice patient and soothing. ""It's alright, Daphy. You're still young. We'll have other babies later, alright?""
Those casual words tore open my most painful wound.
I wasn't young anymore. My body was rendered unable to conceive children long ago.
And I refused to believe Maurice had forgotten who was to blame for that—how dare he forget?
Chapter 3
Five years ago, Maurice had almost monopolized the entire underground business of Seattle.
He handled things with ruthless arrogance, leaving no room for compromise. The enemies he'd made in private were too numerous to count.
The time a trap was set with a dinner Maurice couldn't refuse, I went in his place.
By the time Maurice got the news and rushed over, the three-month-old fetus inside me, along with my uterus, had been removed.
During that period, Maurice, a man who had never been religious, visited every church in town to pray for me and our lost, unborn child.
Then he got down on one knee and proposed to me.
He'd chosen that moment specifically, probably to comfort me.
Back then, Maurice held my hand tightly, his voice choked with emotion as he made his promise, ""Kylie, marry me. I swear I'll always treat you right, protect you, love you...
""If I break this vow, may my body be torn to pieces and my soul never rest in peace!""
Now, ignoring his own bleeding wound, Maurice gently wiped the tears from Daphne's face and scooped her up into his arms.
As he walked past me, he paused.
""Kyleigh, let this be the first and last time you lay a hand on her. If you ever hurt her again, I'll never let you off!""
Maurice stared at me calmly, his voice low and cold. ""Don't touch her again.""
Daphne nestled weakly and helplessly against his chest.
But when she faced me, she flashed a smile full of provocation and smugness.
She mouthed the words: Barren slut.
The next second, I'd already grabbed her by the hair and slapped her.
""Kyleigh!"" Maurice's voice rose, layered with a restrained threat. ""I gave you a chance. You're forcing my hand.""
Did he mean that all he had done for me—the blood and tears he shed, the confessions he made, the vows he swore—was nothing but me coercing him?
After Maurice carried Daphne away, the strength keeping me from collapsing seemed to drain from me instantly.
I looked down at my hands, clean now but still feeling stained with Maurice's blood.
These hands had taken a knife for him, held a gun for him, and once touched my slightly rounded belly with so much hope.
Now, I was left with nothing but coldness.
Marc, the butler who'd been waiting in the shadows, stepped forward and draped a blanket over my shoulders.
""Ms. Thornfield, the two-year deadline is almost up. Mr. Foxley from New York will be here soon...""
I snapped back to reality and gave a quiet response.
Two years ago, Maurice and I had a complete falling-out.
I'd slammed divorce papers in his face, and he'd torn them up right away.
""Kyleigh."" He'd lifted an eyebrow, his smile shallow. ""Between us, there's only widowhood—no divorce.""
I closed my eyes.
""Marc, contact the lawyer. We'll start the litigation process.""
Chapter 4
I went to the cemetery to visit my late parents.
The black-and-white photos showed my parents' kind, smiling faces.
I stood before the gravestones and silently bowed three times.
Maurice had been the one who ruined my family.
On the day my family officially went bankrupt, my father jumped from the rooftop, and my mother swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills.
The memory remained etched in my mind: the ambulance siren's wail and the operating room light that went out after I waited in the hallway for hours.
""Kyleigh,"" a familiar voice came from behind me.
I didn't turn around.
Maurice sounded a little impatient, his voice dropping as he stated his purpose bluntly, ""Daphy is upset about losing the baby. She's insisting I bring you to apologize to her.""
I stood up and walked toward him. ""Fine.""
He seemed surprised I'd agreed so easily.
He narrowed his left eye slightly, suspicion and doubt in his gaze.
In the split second he was distracted, I was already at his side. I kicked the back of his knee, forcing him down hard onto the stone pavement.
Watching Maurice kneel before my parents' gravestones, I smiled with satisfaction. ""You bow a hundred times first, and I'll agree to go.""
Maurice's face contorted in rage. As he tried to rise, I pressed the cold barrel of his own gun to his head while his hand still fumbled for it at his waist.
Instantly, Maurice reached back to grab the gun. I frowned instinctively and pulled the trigger.
The gunshot was mixed with a woman's scream.
""Oh! Stop!""
The recoil made my palm tingle.
I looked up to see that the bullet had barely grazed Maurice's cheek, leaving only a thin line of blood.
It added a touch of eerie charm to his already handsome, intimidating face.
I sighed with regret. ""What a pity.""
""Lunatic! You crazy bitch! You actually dared to shoot!"" Daphne, who had arrived at some point, stared at me in disbelief.
I let out a cold laugh and pointed the gun directly at her.
Her face instantly turned pale with terror.
Maurice's expression was icy. He clamped his hand around my wrist.
As the pressure intensified, I could hear the bones in my hand beginning to crack.
""Kyleigh, now it's your turn.""
Chapter 5
Maurice forced me to my knees in front of Daphne.
Daphne lifted my chin with the tip of her high heel, a smug look on her face. ""Apologize to me, Kyleigh.
""Lick my shoe clean, and I might consider forgiving you for your offense the other day.""
I was made to kneel on the cold stone, yet I let out a hollow laugh. ""Daphne, who do you think you are to deserve that?""
""Kyleigh, apologize now,"" Maurice warned me.
In the portrait beside us, my parents still looked at me gently.
I kept laughing, though my eyes started to sting.
""Maurice, have you forgotten who fought alongside you all those years?
""You destroyed my family and drove my parents to their deaths. Now you want me to apologize to your mistress on my knees!
""Don't you think you're a monster?""
Maurice frowned, but before he could speak, Daphne cut in to defend him, ""Stop playing the victim, Kyleigh! Your parents' betrayal nearly got Maury killed at the dinner that day!""
I didn't hear what else Daphne said because I passed out.
When I opened my eyes again, I was in a hospital room.
The doctor said I'd fainted from heart palpitations caused by extreme emotional stress.
My body had already been damaged after I lost the baby. It was an old condition flaring up.
The thought of my lost child sent a fresh, dull ache through me.
My phone buzzed with a taunting text from Daphne. Attached was a picture of two marriage certificates, stamped with today's date.
I was stunned.
Maurice actually committed bigamy?
""Kyleigh, you didn't know, did you?"" the text read. ""Your marriage certificate with Maury was a fake!
""He'd never actually marry a ruined woman like you. Your so-called marriage meant nothing. I'm his legal wife now.""
If it were in the past, learning this truth probably would've shattered me.
But now, I felt strangely calm. I even felt a sense of relief.
It was better this way. It saved me the trouble.
I heard that the top auction house in Seattle had a religious statue as one of the items tonight.
No one was interested in it until I raised my paddle to bid.
Then, from a private booth on the second floor, someone countered.
I looked up and met Maurice's impassive gaze.
He had his arm around Daphne, who was looking up at him and whining, ""Maury, we lost our baby. I want that statue to pray for him. Help me get it, okay?""
Maurice nodded in agreement.
After that, no matter how high I bid, he immediately topped it.
""Kyleigh, give up."" Maurice looked down at me, his gaze detached. ""Daphy wants it. Let her have it. Consider it your atonement.""
I ignored him completely.
""I'll top it at any price,"" I announced.
Daphne's look of triumph instantly changed. ""The Thornfield family is bankrupt! Where would she get that kind of money?""
The auctioneer also looked at me apologetically. ""Ms. Thornfield, the rules require proof of your funds for such a bid.""
I gave a slight nod and pulled a black card from my jacket. ""Is this sufficient?""
Someone with sharp eyes recognized it immediately.
""Isn't that the exclusive black card for the head of the Foxley family from New York? How does she have it?""
""It has to be a fake! It's a forgery!"" Daphne shrieked.
Maurice frowned as well. ""Kyleigh, you don't need to embarrass yourself like this for pride. A lie this clumsy will be exposed soon.""
I turned my head to look at him, my gaze settling on the black patch over his right eye. ""Maurice, I'm starting to wonder if you're blind in one eye, or both?""
After verifying the card, the auctioneer gasped. ""The black card is real!""
Just then, a commotion came from the main entrance.
""Mr. Foxley is here!""
Dominic Foxley strolled casually over to me. Under Maurice's furious, disbelieving stare, he calmly put his arm around my shoulders.
""Sorry to keep you waiting, honey.""

1ol2t0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1ol2t0v/if_you_dont_understand_lover_boy/,"If you don't understand lover boy,","Dear B,

     I love him, all that is him, all of him, and I don't know if I could ever love another like him. I love that he rises graceful as the morning sun, knowing he'd rather stay in a warmer bed. The way he smells and the way he marks his scent upon the world. Like kerosene it burns into my brain with a familiarity I've only ever felt in my dreams. Like smoke, my lungs breathe it in and fill every aveoli with grass, and life, and simultaneously, burnt flowers, for a life long past. Akin to musk, I can't get enough of it, it turns gears in me I didn't, couldn't have even remembered I had. When the smell of coffee and breakfast fills the library, I wonder what I had done to deserve, and ever forget, what the love of this man would do, for. Slipping on glasses freshly tightened, cleaned, I love him cause I know nobody else could take such care. 

I love seeing him grow in strength. Mentally he's a fighter, always had to be. And that's why when he shows such softnsss I can't help but glow. When he rises into crane, or form of snake, I see a tremor in what life has done to such a creature. Never could get over the slight tremble in those fingers. The same tremble that flips a page, or finds just the right one of my own so very often. The same tremble I kiss after prayers. The same one I see in the swing of glittering metal running drills or forms like he'd done it a thousand times before. The tremble that can hold a face so softly, and yet be an end to one without actually giving it thought when necessary, and in those moments, be still as the same iron they carry.  It doesn't matter if it's iron or wood or flesh and bone, I love him for his care to each and every thing. 

And how he shows that love is like a blinding sun. Except. More luminous then our very own Sol. He'd force himself into tears if he saw a stray, knowing he'd take it in in a heartbeat. How all of the creatures are ours and only ours to share. In each and everyone of us he stares so deeply with eyes like a hawk, or a bear. But he isn't looking through you like prey, but looking for those soft pinpricks of light hiding in our eyes like the stars he'd so much rather visit. I admire that he'd teach you how to touch those stars, and walk in their light, physically, spiritually, metaphorically or metaphysically, he'd never shy no matter how dark it can be. I love that so much that when everything is cold and so very far away, he opens up a light and comes to anywhere just to find you there, and show how to find the way again. In each of us he'd drown in his own dark, just to shine and sparse light to the corners in the basements of our minds, and the universe, if he had his way. 

He can look like a demon, from far enough away. But so to did the angels strike such a fear in man. ""Be not afraid"". But that demon only shows when you ask him to finally lay down and warm a shallow place on the couch. His presence then is adored so much my heart feels like it'll beat right off its rhythm and through my ribs. Like an explosion, or a few strategically placed and plotted billion of them, it lights a cacophony of fireworks through my nerves. And then only when his attention wholeheartedly shifts to me is my world upended, and I can see myself, him, in totality. Gray hairs one day. Laugh lines. A nervous system finally becalmed by the presence of memories minted solely with my one true heart. 

I could write a million lines. A letter with ne'r ending pages that float and create new tides, they blot the oceans so. Black oceans, so full of newly spilt ink. And none of it would do justice to this one man. This one person I love so dearly. For in this person isn't just a soul, but a god made manifest in man, and he knows that together with just the right fit, we'd be free to touch the face of God.",5,1761936305.0,LoveLetters,2,1.0,False

Bio:      

Caine is a smart, spirited pup who’s ready for a fresh start. He may be a little vocal at his kennel door, but once you’re with him, he shows off his brighter side—waiting patiently for treats and showing off his “sit” and “stay.”



In playgroups, Caine enjoys a gentle, dainty style. He does well with other calm dogs and likes to ease into social time—sometimes mingling, sometimes exploring on his own. In the play yard, he’s happiest sniffing, pottying, and calmly taking it all in.



Caine is looking for a patient, experienced, and loving family who can give him the stability he deserves. With time and consistency, this easygoing guy will make a wonderful companion.

I have spent most of my life building things, a career, stability, peace, and somewhere along the way I realised there is still one chapter left, finding the person I would want to share it all with.

I work remotely which means my office can be anywhere, from a hilltop in Himachal to a quiet cafe nearby. I love spontaneous drives, mountain air, deep conversations, and time outdoors.

I have built a stable life, but I am not chasing the next big thing, at least not alone.

If I had to describe myself in a few words, emotionally aware, loyal, and a little too introspective for my own good sometimes. I am not the small talk type, I connect deeper or not at all.

I am hoping to find someone kind, emotionally mature, and grounded, the kind who knows that peace matters more than drama but laughter still matters most. Someone who can match sarcasm with sense and calm with chaos.

If you enjoy long drives, coffee that turns into conversations, and the idea of building something real, not rushed, not forced, then maybe we are already on the same path.

So yes, this is my last attempt before monk mode, and who knows, maybe this is the one that works. DM if you'd like to connect.

Therefore, the idea that psychiatrists are treating an illness with medication is patently false, or at best questionable.

The strange behavior of a schizophrenic patient is likely due to horrendous emotional and/or physical child abuse. No one can see this abuse which occurs in private. In order to cope/survive, the child creates a false reality to help them get through. Perhaps there is an element of biology within the brain (which we do not understand at this time) which may make some people more susceptible to losing touch with reality as the majority of us see it, however, that is not known with certainty at this time.

Therefore, to conclude that there are illnesses in the brain requiring a medical physician (psychiatrist) who allegedly understands the brain is one of the shortcomings of our modern society. 

In reality, psychiatrists are more like bartenders, serving 10 different kinds of beer and five different kinds of coffee. That’s it.

So every time I see a patient who claims they are being treated by a psychiatrist, I feel very sorry for them. Because they are actually being poisoned and scammed at the same time by an elaborate con scheme.

We are an advanced society, but in some ways we remain woefully primitive. Psychiatry is one of the clearest modern examples of that - fake medicine in a modern age.

I also love learning tidbits about the most random topics: from quantum physics, to historical events. I just love to fill my brain with as much knowledge as I possibly can. The more obscure, the more interesting it becomes to me.

I also love all things analog, which is why I have this love for penpalling. It has to be the reflective nature that the slowness brings about: from putting ink to page while writing a letter, or exercising great care while putting out your records. 

I am a huge coffee fan as well. I own a French Press and a Moka Pot, and I grind my beans every morning! Along with that, I also love running, learning new languages, discovering music (or even different radio stations in different countries), solving jigsaw puzzles and discovering new hobbies to cram into my schedule.

Of course that's absurd. That's the whole point. That's a vague announcement, at best, and it is basically begging the recipient to chase them down to fill in the blanks.

""Hey, we should do coffee"" or ""hey, we should get together some time"" and others like that are performative and equally vague. **This kind of ambiguity leaves people guessing and unsure of where they fit, and/or triggers their people pleasing/fawn response to chase the person down for the details.**

I'm Alex, a self-taught techie who stumbled into content creation straight out of college. I always loved media, but the endless editing and posting? Not so much. Cue my journey into the world of automation and AI, intrigued by how they could transform the content game. 

My first experiments were all over the place—using duct-tape solutions and random tools to make my workflow less painful. Spoiler: they didn't scale! But they sparked an idea: what if AI could streamline this whole process? The clarity hit when I watched friends toil away at editing for hours with little to show apart from eye bags.

I started toying with scenarios on Make.com, wiring up APIs like some late-night mad scientist. Early testers were basically friends I bribed with coffee, but their enthusiasm gave me hope. Our first win was an ugly-but-functional prototype that spat out a coherent video in minutes. Can't explain the thrill of seeing that first automated video; we celebrated with energy drinks and high fives!

HypeCaster is far from perfect, but today it stands as a platform to help creators effortlessly generate and distribute content through AI and automation. We’ve come a long way but there's still a lot to build.

1.	App connection failure:
On the first setup, the La Marzocco Home App successfully detected my machine and displayed “Connecting,” but the connection failed after a few seconds. Since then, every time I try again, the app quickly shows “No device available” during scanning. I’ve already tried deleting and reinstalling the app, restarting the machine, and checking my Wi-Fi, but the issue remains.

2.	Machine initially worked fine:
After some manual experimenting with the control buttons, I was able to brew two cups of coffee. At that time, both the brew boiler and steam boiler were functioning normally, and both pressure gauges were active.

3.	Steam boiler stopped working later:
A few hours later, when I turned the machine back on, it preheated normally, but the steam-boiler pressure gauge stayed at 0 bar, and turning the steam knob produced no response. Power-cycling and following various online reset tips didn’t help.

4.	All buttons now trigger brew-head water:
Pressing any of the six front buttons (including the FN button) only causes the brew head to release water, instead of performing their normal functions.

please advise what might be causing this issue, and whether there is a way to fully reset the machine?

I never see a song title or artist or album anywhere in the description…are these all just AI?! Some of the music has been nice enough that I really don’t want to think it’s AI, but now I don’t know. I started paying more attention to detail and noticed a lot of the videos I click on have been uploaded in the past few days from me viewing it. Shazam just brings up “Coffee Jazz Relaxing” as the song for one I just randomly did now. Is this all just AI? I hate that if that’s the case!! Nothing about that is relaxing to me.

Recently, I found out that he met up with his ex for coffee. The thing is, he didn’t tell me beforehand, I only saw it in a group chat notification that mentioned the meetup.

In our society, relationships are often seen as not just between two people but also as a trust bond that affects family and friends. Personally, I feel that meeting an ex without informing your current partner crosses a line of transparency and respect, even if the intention is innocent. I understand it was just coffee, but in the context of trust and societal expectations about respect and honesty in relationships, it hurt me.

When I calmly told him how I felt, he said I was overthinking and being too sensitive. He believes it’s normal to meet friends from the past and that I shouldn’t make it a big deal. I see where he’s coming from, but I also think that in a relationship, communication about situations that could affect feelings is very important.

I’m now questioning whether I’m overreacting or if it’s reasonable to expect transparency in relationships, especially in a culture where trust and respect are highly valued.

Am I overreacting here, or is it fair to feel hurt and expect honesty in such situations?",5,1761935455.0,AmIOverreacting,12,1.0,False

If you're like me and you've ever cursed at a sluggish Gulp build while trying to spin up a custom theme, pull up a chair. I just dropped WP Rig v3.1, and holy cow, it feels like we've finally caught up to the JS world. No more waiting around for compiles that take longer than my coffee break – we're talking **2x faster builds** out of the box, with a watch process that's so snappy it's basically HMR for WordPress. (What a time to be alive, right? 😎)

I've been heads-down tweaking this open-source starter kit because, let's be real, theme development shouldn't feel like wrestling a dinosaur. WP Rig's always been about keeping things lightweight and dev-friendly, but v3.1? It's next-level. Here's the juicy stuff:

* **Ditched Gulp for Custom Node Magic:** Swapped out that old beast for lean scripts that crank through JS/CSS in half the time. Pair it with Bun (faster than npm, hands down – you'll be amazed by the blazing speed), and your installs are done before you can say ""dependency hell.""
* **Image Processing on Steroids:** Hello, Sharp! Goodbye, clunky Imagemin. Now it auto-converts to WebP, runs lightning-fast, and doesn't bog down your dev server. Perfect for those asset-heavy sites.
* **CLI Wizards for Everyday Wins:**
   * Generate PHP components in seconds – scaffolds everything in /inc and hooks it into your theme.php. No more boilerplate burnout.
   * **Child themes? Presto!** One command flips your Rig into a full child setup, stripping parent-only bits and firing up builds for *any* theme (even premium ones). Game over for manual tweaks.
   * Local fonts FTW: Scans your Google Fonts, downloads 'em to /assets/fonts, and spits out the CSS. Ditch the CDN roulette for better perf and privacy.
   * Block theme conversion: Zap your universal theme into a block-based beast, complete with theme.json – Customizer and menus? See ya.
   * And for block lovers: Built-in tools to create/register Gutenberg blocks right in your theme (powered by @wordpress/create-block). Export to plugins if you want, or keep 'em cozy.

This isn't just fluff – it's all about shaving hours off your workflow so you can focus on the fun stuff, like crafting killer designs or debugging that one weird edge case. I've already used the child command on a client project, and it saved me a solid afternoon.

WP Rig's free, MIT-licensed, and 100% community-driven – if you've got ideas or PRs, hit me up on GitHub. Grab it here: [wprig.io](https://wprig.io) or straight from the repo.

Devs, what's your biggest pain point with theme setups right now? Gulp refugees, have you tried Bun yet? Drop your thoughts below – let's chat and maybe collab on the next feature. 🚀

Cheers,

Both my husband and I have no idea what they are or how they would have gotten in the sink. They kind of remind me of coffee beans, but we don’t keep coffee beans in the house. Nothing I’ve cooked with recently contained anything that looked like these. They’re very hard- my husband was able to smash one with a my chicken mallet, but it took a few whacks. It is hollow inside and a lighter brown color. It’s possible (likely?) they were much smaller going down the drain initially and have since swelled up to this larger size, though if that’s the case I don’t know why they would still be so hard.

Does anyone have any idea what it is? My husband’s theory is I must have cooked with an exotic ingredient and didn’t realize it couldn’t go down the drain. I can’t remember anything like that, but it is certainly possible. Obviously it should not be going down my garbage disposal, so I want to figure out what it is and how it got there so I can prevent this from happening again in the future.",4,1761935350.0,whatisit,35,1.0,False

• Land at Changi Airport Terminal 3. Typical immigration time: 30–45 minutes.
• Left Baggage: available in the Arrivals halls (T1/T3) — plan S$6–10 per bag.
• Freshen options: Changi terminal showers, or Jewel YOTELAIR for a private rest pod (hourly).
• Quick kopi (coffee) or kaya toast if needed — Toast Box / Ya Kun in arrivals/jewel.
• Leave the airport by 08:45 to reach the city by ~09:15. Options: MRT (~40 min) or Grab (~25 min).
09:15–10:30 — Breakfast (Maxwell Food Centre)
• Head to Maxwell Food Centre (Maxwell MRT nearby). This is a genuine local hawker hub used by office
workers and residents.
• Stall to try: Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice (Bib Gourmand / heavily recommended by locals).
• Nearby: Chinatown Complex (largest hawker centre in Singapore) — peek at the famous Liao Fan Hong
Kong Soya Sauce Chicken (Michelin-starred hawker).
• Suggestion: order a small plate each — chicken rice, a kopi, and a light fried item if you want variety without
getting too full early.
10:30–12:00 — Heritage Walk: Telok Ayer / Amoy St
• Walk from Maxwell towards Telok Ayer and Amoy Street area (short ride/walk).
• Visit Thian Hock Keng Temple — one of Singapore’s oldest Chinese temples; quiet in the morning.
• Amoy Street Food Centre has a handful of modern hawker stalls; locals often mention A Noodle Story
(Michelin Bib) as an interesting, modern ramen-ish option.
• Club Street and Ann Siang Hill nearby: restored shophouses, cafés, and local boutiques. Keep this section
light — the goal is to feel the city’s texture.
12:15–13:45 — Coffee & Local Vibe: Tiong Bahru
• Short Grab to Tiong Bahru (10–15 minutes). This residential neighbourhood is beloved by locals for its
art-deco architecture and relaxed cafés.
• Coffee at Nylon Coffee Roasters or Forty Hands. Walk Yong Siak St and Tiong Poh Road to see
independent bookstores and galleries.
• If you'd like a small hawker bite: Lee’s Fried Carrot Cake (Tiong Bahru Market) is a Michelin Bib favourite
among locals. Try a small portion only — you have a late lunch planned.
14:00–16:00 — Late Lunch: Chilli Crab at East Coast Lagoon
• Grab to East Coast Lagoon Food Village (~15 minutes). This is a local favourite for seafood and
beachside dining.
• Recommended stall: Leng Heng BBQ Seafood (frequented by locals on r/SingaporeEats). Order: Chilli
crab (confirm market size/price), fried mantou, and sambal stingray.
• After eating, take a 5–10 minute stroll along the East Coast Park promenade to digest — locals often cycle
or relax here in the late afternoon. • Note: chilli crab portions are large and priced by weight — consider
sharing or ordering a medium-sized crab.
16:30–18:30 — Evening Local Culture: Kampong Glam / Haji Lane
• Head to Kampong Glam (Grab ~15 minutes). Explore Arab Street, Bussorah Street, and the Sultan
Mosque.
• Wander Haji Lane for street art, boutique shops, and a lively but local atmosphere. Perfect for photos and
quick shopping.
• Snack/dinner option: Zam Zam is a famous local spot for murtabak (hearty) if you want something
substantial; otherwise grab tea/refreshments at a café.
• Tip: this area combines cultural heritage with hip cafes — it’s a good spot to balance food and light
exploration.
19:00–20:45 — Return to Changi & Lounge Time
• Depart Kampong Glam by 19:00 via Grab to reach Changi T3 by ~19:30–19:45 (allow traffic variability).
• Jewel Changi Rain Vortex: light shows scheduled in the evening — a quick stop if you have time before
heading airside.
• By 20:45, be airside and settle into the SATS Premier Lounge (showers, food, quiet space) so you can rest
before your 00:15 flight.
• Boarding around 23:15–23:30 for a 00:15 pushback (confirm at check-in on the day).",2,1761935095.0,askSingapore,5,1.0,False

House Bill 206, introduced by Reps. Jennifer Gross (R-West Chester) and Riordan McClain (R-Ashland), would establish a state currency based on gold and silver. The bill directs the state treasurer to set up a transactional currency rooted in silver and gold to address concerns with the value of the U.S. dollar.

I’ve been struggling with intense depression for a while and have isolated myself for years. Because of that, I don’t really have any friends, and my anxiety makes socializing pretty hard. I’ve tried going to meetups and board game nights, but I usually end up being quiet, boring, and awkward.

There are probably a few people here who understand what that’s like. Maybe people who might also be working through loneliness, depression, anxiety, or trying to rebuild connection again. 

I’d love to do low-key things like going for a walk, grabbing a coffee, playing a chill video game, or even body doubling while we do our own stuff. If you’re in a similar place, please reach out.",11,1761935054.0,Vancouver4Friends,11,1.0,False

1ol27yf,https://i.redd.it/s8yv248kohyf1.jpeg,"Why ""Get Your Ex Girlfriend Back"" Starts with Letting Go – The No-Contact Reset That Changed Everything","54M here – the guy who turned an 8-year ""I need space"" breakup into a desperate chase that left me blocked, ashamed, and smaller than ever. If you're scrolling ""how to get ex girlfriend back"" tips at 3 AM, heart in your throat, I feel you. I did too – midnight texts, ""one last talk"" emails, even ""accidental"" run-ins at her coffee spot. Thought it'd prove my worth. Spoiler: It proved her distance. But after hitting rock bottom (sleepless nights, ""what if"" loops), I locked in real no contact. She reached out at month 6, post-rebound crash. We talked, but I walked – upgraded and whole. The secret? ""Getting her back"" isn't a script; it's a you-first rebuild. Here's the advice that flipped my script – no tricks, just truths from the trenches.

**Step 1: No Contact Isn't Waiting – It's Your Hard Reset**  
Ditch the ""she'll come back if she cares"" myth – it's scarcity that sparks curiosity (psych backs it: absence amps value 40%). Full blackout: Delete numbers, block everywhere, no peeks. I cracked early with a ""hope you're okay"" slip – cue fresh pain. Commit 30-90 days; arm yourself with a ""red flag journal"" (her fades during your lows). Why? It breaks the addiction cycle (dopamine withdrawal, per brain science), so you're vetting her ""interest,"" not chasing validation.

**Step 2: Upgrade Solo – Become the Version She Regrets Missing**  
Quick fixes like ""text her this"" flop; permanent pulls come from your glow. I swapped desperation for therapy (unpacked my fear of alone), 20-min walks (endorphins slash anxiety 28%, APA stats), and wins log (daily: ""Nailed a hike solo""). Subtle social posts (gym glow, not thirst) signal strength. Opportunity: Most ""get ex back"" advice skips inner work – do it, and 70% of exes ping changed (from forum patterns). You're not fixing for her; you're fixing for the life you deserve.

**Step 3: If She Reaches, Vet Ruthlessly – Crumbs Aren't Comebacks**  
She did: ""Miss us."" I countered: ""Show me growth – coffee, no pressure."" Green? Accountability (her therapy steps), consistent actions. Red? Vague apologies or rebound guilt. Boundaries rule: ""Mutual or nothing."" True ""get ex girlfriend back"" needs equality – I chose forward into laughs and peace, not cycles.

Myth busted: No contact ""forces"" her return? Nah – it forces *your* freedom, back or not. I'm proof: Happily married now, no ghosts. If it's her, you'll attract her upgraded. If not? You're the prize.

What's one reset step you're claiming today to break the chase? Share – your story fuels us all.

**TL;DR:** Get ex girlfriend back? No contact reset (30-90 days), solo glow-up, ruthless vet if she pings. You first – that's the permanent pull.

Not the big milestones or life changes, just the quiet comforts that make me exhale a little deeper.

Like that first sip of coffee in the morning when everything’s still quiet.  
Or clean sheets after a long shower.  
Or when your favorite song comes on shuffle right when you need it.  
Or when someone texts you, “Home safe?”, those little reminders that you’re cared for.

It’s so easy to overlook these moments when life feels loud and overwhelming. But honestly, they’re what keep me grounded.

I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",0,1761934698.0,R4R30Plus,1,0.43,False

I was a fresh-faced PM, barely a year into my first 'real' product job. My baby was a massive new feature we’d hyped for months. Marketing had the slick campaigns ready to go, the VPs were already patting themselves on the back in meetings, and the pressure was on.

About a week before launch, our lead engineer, a grizzled veteran who communicated mainly through grunts and pull requests, cornered me in the kitchen. 'It's not ready,' he said, staring into his coffee like it held the secrets of the universe. 'The foundation is shaky. It'll work for the demo, but it won't survive in the wild.' I heard him, but I didn't *listen*. I was blinded by the roadmap, the deadlines, and the pressure from above. I told him we had to launch and deal with the 'minor bugs' as they came up.

The day of the launch felt like a movie premiere. We were all huddled around a monitor watching the real-time usage stats. For the first five minutes, it was glorious. The numbers ticked up. People were using it! Then, the first Slack message hit our support channel. Then another. And another. It wasn't a trickle; it was a flood. The feature wasn't just buggy; it was actively corrupting user data. The whole site started groaning under the strain. We had built a beautiful, gleaming sports car on a chassis made of popsicle sticks and glue.

Making the call to roll it back was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. It felt like a personal failure. The team was demoralized, my boss was furious, and I spent the night convinced I’d be fired. But the next morning, we huddled up, no finger-pointing, just a shared mission: fix it. For two straight weeks, fueled by pizza and a humbling sense of purpose, we rebuilt the foundation. We relaunched quietly, with no fanfare. And it worked. Perfectly. It quickly became one of our most beloved features.

That disaster was the best thing that ever happened to my career. It taught me that my primary job isn't to ship features; it's to manage risk. It taught me to trust the quiet engineer in the corner over the loud executive in the boardroom. And it taught me that sometimes, the bravest product decision you can make is to have the courage to wait.

So, Reddit, what was your 'trial by fire' moment? What's the biggest lesson you learned from a project that went completely sideways?",1,1761934636.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
