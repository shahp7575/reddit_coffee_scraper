1hq6cy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hq6cy0/mom_has_been_stealing_medication_from_the_entire/,Mom has been stealing medication from the entire family,"I'm going to try to make this as detailed as possible. I'm 19 years old and I pay rent every month to live with my stepdad and my mom. Since I was a preteen, my mother has been consistently stealing controlled substances from both me and my stepdad.

I have seizures and have frequently had them go 5+ minutes long and was prescribed an emergency rescue medication, a benzodiazepine, that would go missing every time it was filled. Medicine that could potentially save my life. She has stolen it from me so many times that my doctor won't let me fill it anymore until I go back in to get another EEG. My neurologist is 4 hours away. I can't drive and my stepdad works all day so I haven't been able to go. I have none left and am scared that something will happen and I will be dead.

My stepdad has a prescription for narcotics that he takes when his back acts up. He does not fill it until he has to take it, but my mom has previously filled it for him and taken all of it, or stolen it from him once he did fill it. He had to put a camera in his office so that he could make sure she didn't steal any. He has her on video, not entirely clearly, opening a pill bottle of his and walking out of the office. I'm not sure that it would be enough to qualify as evidence.

Recently, my grandpa (her dad) died and she went to my grandma's (her mom's) house with my aunt (her sister). She rooted through my grandma's closet as well as my aunt's things, we're assuming to try and find pills. She frequently calls her doctor not long after she fills her meds to say that the dosage was wrong or that they messed it up. She tries to fill it early, and her primary doctor has refused to prescribe it anymore because of this. She now gets it from a pain management doctor.

My stepdad refuses to give her any of his prescriptions, even though they take the same one because it's still illegal. When he says no to her, she goes into these insane rages where she throws coffee mugs against the wall and against him and screams and yells. One night, she was sobbing, hysterical to the point that it sounded fake, all. night. long. I have a voice recording where you can hear her screaming and mugs shattering and my stepdad saying that he will call the police if she doesn't stop throwing things at him. 

It has just been getting worse lately and I really want to report her. Not because I want to see her get in trouble, but because I am worried about her. It's not normal. I want to file a police report and I know how to do it, but can I even do that when it isn't just an isolated incident? And without sufficient, concrete evidence? I know my stepdad, aunt, grandma, and everyone would back everything up and support me, but would they even bother to question them because of the lack of real evidence? Any advice is appreciated.

he smelled coffee beans. 

The Puerto Rican ones 

that his mother liked 

from the coffee shop 

with the red walls 

somewhere he can't quite remember 

in the East Village.

&nbsp;

She would take him there 

on Saturdays 

past the tatoo shops 

with glass pipes in the windows 

buy him a syrupy almond cake 

that made his fingers gritty 

and sweet 

while she picked the shiny green package 

off of the shlef 

and breathed it in. 

&nbsp;  

He would run 

barefoot and careless 

around the kitchen 

one bright Sunday morning 

after church 

and bump her elbow 

spilling the coffee 

on her brand new white dress 

It was the first time 

but not the last 

that he made his mother cry. 

&nbsp;  

He poured it 

into cracked blue cups 

when he was a teenager 

and his father died 

serving it to his Aunt and Uncle 

grief filling the silence 

while his mother rested 

in the bedroom. 

&nbsp;  

He smelled it on December mornings 

lying in his childhood bed 

when he visited her 

now lonely and ill 

for Christmas 

knowing there would only 

be a few more left. 

&nbsp;  

He remembered Tuesdays 

in her cluttered apartment 

on 2nd Avenue 

the smell seeping from the kitchen 

as he sorts her unpaid bills 

pink final notices 

realizing that this mess 

is beyond his control 

hoping that today she remembers 

the name she gave him. 

&nbsp;  

It would burn his tongue 

as he drank it from her favorite mug 

the warm August night 

that he packed her life 

into boxes 

still wearing the black itchy suit 

from the funeral 

the one he never wore again. 

&nbsp;  

Now on the uptown R train,

he is suddenly wrapped 

in black itchy suits 

pink final notices 

cracked blue cups 

brand new white dresses  

shiny green packages 

red walls in the coffee shop 

whose cross streets 

he can't quite remember. 
 

&nbsp;  

On the walk home, 

he will see her reflection 

in every window.

Machine has never been serviced, but I did open it up to vacuum loose grinds out, one time. When the machine is first turned on, it seems & sounds sluggish when the motors/gears are turning prior to first brew. Currently, the machine is producing weak, watery coffee - somewhat transparent. It happens with course and fine ground settings.  The used grinds are then disposed of into the catch tray - the grinds are not pucks as they should be, but loose and watery - almost looks like soil. Doesn’t seem to be a flow issue as there is no hesitation from the pour spout. This issue is with both the small cup (espresso) and large cup (coffee) settings. 

I’m to the point that I need to call a service provider, but seeking tips to see if it can be self done first. 

Thanks in advanced.

She says its her favourite city in Taiwan. I'm aware it's very prosperous from TSMC as well.

So why does it feel so... unremarkable to me? I like exploring cities but when my wife has set me loose to explore Hsinchu myself I feel I pretty much run out of things to check out very quickly, and then just struggle to find a place to just sit and chill until I can leave. I basically went along that riverside park near the train station, to the City God temple to some museum about KMT military settlements which was mildly interesting, then a zoo which was just ok, and a mildly interesting glass museum near the zoo. Then... what? That seems the extent of tourist things to do.

For some reason all the cafes apart from chains like Louisa Coffee always seem to be closed whenever I pass them? The food doesn't seem that impressive either, the food by the City God temple was rather insipid, lacking strong or distinctive flavours and also seemed light on vegetables or anything to give some colour or flavour. 

It's also a remarkably unphotogenic city, unfriendly to pedestrians, and crowded.

I haven't been to any bars here but I researched them and walked past them, and they seem to be very few and very small.

Might be exaggerating a bit, but in some ways I feel it's the worst city I've ever been to. Boring is fine, if it's pretty or relaxing, and it is neither. Stressful and busy is fine, if it's exciting and cosmopolitan, but it isn't. It also seems like a cultural desert. I struggle to think of anything to recommend it, and I can't say that of many cities I've visited.

I'm baffled as to how my wife could prefer this over Taipei, Nanping or even Taichung, but don't want to have this conversation with her as I feel it would hurt her feelings to know how I feel about her favourite city in Taiwan. I'm also baffled as to how such a prosperous place could be so crap. 

Am I doing it wrong? Am I missing something? Is the city just not for me? Or is it really the worst city in Taiwan?",5,1735617501.0,taiwan,4,1.0,False

Now, I don’t know if I need a service dog. That is the issue. For background, I am a 15 year old girl in Pennsylvania. I am currently going through the process of getting a service dog with a ADI accredited nonprofit. [My family isn’t crazy rich btw, something about where I live and Medicaid so it’ll be like 10k…? Any-who, yeah.] 

What happened was my mom was like ‘you sould get a service dog’ and I was like ight 🤷. So she’s like ‘okay~! What day do you want interviewed~’ and I’m like what?! idk 😥!!?

 Mind you she’s 20 hours into paperwork and emails about this as y’all know. 

So I do my research and all because I’m not showing up and being like, ‘idk man’. 

The tasks my dog will have is dpt, anxiety attack/harmful stimming interruption, body blocking(? Front or behind command) and directional support(? Forward command for when I get stuck in the bathroom/home or whatever) for my ‘disabilities’(more on air quotes later) autism+anxiety+PTSD. 

I do: the interview
email them back
do a cte(tryout in public)
email back
official waitlist
meet a round of dogs
email back
not matched
and now I’m meeting another round in a few weeks. 

***SIDE BAR 
~You may be thinking
…and you haven’t made up your mind…? 
The answer is I’ve tried A LOT. I’m talking Ven diagrams, Google graphs (I don’t even have Excel [im 15]) talking into my school counselors, personal counselor, looking at this subreddit religiously… like seriously. So i figured… just post it and let them yell and me or not yk.~

The thing is, I don’t know if I have a disability to be completely honest. Although I think the service dog will mitigate my problems. 

SIDE NOTE 2~This maybe internalized feeling about the word disabled *or* I’m not and I’m really pissing every disabled person off right now.~

 I think do *not*
have a disability because I am busy and well accomplished girl (all music stuff). Sure I have a 504 in school but I don’t use it a lot. I can function just a little limitedly. 

The things that *may quantify*
1)I cannot go places/ do things alone. It limits me. Example: ordering a coffee, talking to a stranger, going to a store/park alone. My body won’t move like even if I’m threatened.
2) the overstimulation I experience *sometimes* stops me from going places. 
3) If I push though I often don’t have enough energy to take care of my hygiene/homework/laundry. 

Now the big thing is it’s sometimes… I do do all of those things but… not as much as acceptable… yk

WRAPPING UP!

Extra lowkey irrelevant info but may make you understand why I’m asking better: my mom says a dog will help. my sister says she ‘doesn’t understand’, but I do try really hard to not make it her problem. My dad sees it as a cheep way to get a nice dog. i think. 

On top of all that I have massive massive anxiety specifically about my future job and it doesn’t help to add a service dog to that, so maybe a word of wisdom on that too if you think I’m not dumb and wasting the nonprofit’s time/money.

Aside from future job, I think a sd will help me. 

So yeah. 

Things you could answer if you want: (a) disabled or not (b) what to do in school to get a good job with a service dog

Thank you and please please do not tear me apart. 


Edit for bot: I am 100% sure somewhere along the line it has been written in paper by a medical professional as I’m approved for the application with the nonprofit. I just think there may be a difference between papers and real life. ",2,1735617430.0,service_dogs,1,0.75,False

I used to live in her country and we would get a coffee now and again (we got along well and she gave good hugs), but we lived fairly far apart and I was having a difficult time, so we didn't really get to know each other deeply. I always used to practice the challenging local language with her when we texted, but it was only after I left earlier this year that we started talking about personal things more regularly. I then started to realize that she had a lot of the qualities I appreciate, especially at an intellectual level - I really haven't met many similar people of any gender. She was also there for me during a very difficult period of my life when almost nobody else was.

I never was allowed to date until I left home - after a bad date in the country where I live now (only my second or third ever) a month or two ago, I decided to re-evaluate that part of my life a little and consider which people I had encountered who I would (hypothetically) want to date. Most of them were not single, but J was (and still is).

Over time, our conversations (almost all in her native language, in which my abilities have dramatically improved) have gotten quite playful and maybe even a bit flirty (in a non-sexual way). A while ago, having grown up in a controlling environment and having a tendency to overthink things, I worried that I had maybe made J uncomfortable by being overly playful, but she lightly brushed it off and things have continued the same way. She's basically reciprocated the attention - we're always liking each other's posts/stories on social media, she has taken compliments about her skills and personality well, and I've even told her that she looks good in a message (which she liked.) As I won't get to see her in person at least until this summer, she's indicated her openness to a phone/video call, so I might get more indications from that once she's back from the holidays.

My confidence is much higher than it was when I lived in her country and I've also gotten more in shape, so normally I feel I wouldn't have any doubts about going for it, but the thing that really gets me is that I would be perfectly happy to stay friends (unlike one or two similar situations in the past) and I don't want my romantic feelings to affect the way we're texting. The amount of time that I have to wait to figure out things is also keeping me up at night sometimes, although I feel more sure of myself when I think about how I haven't met anyone similar where I live currently.

If I turn on the rational part of my mind, she is way better looking than me (and knows very well how attractive she is), she has only been in short-term relationships for a long time (she says she gave up on falling in love), and I don't know how comfortable she is with long-distance relationships, although one of my goals is moving to a country that just happens to be closer to hers. But when I consider the emotional part, she is an absolute sweetheart - I have a soft personality myself and find similar people very attractive - and while I don't put anyone on a pedestal, she really does have everything I would want in a person. Based on our honest discussions, I would be able to give her many things she feels she hasn't had in relationships, especially when it comes to intellectual and philosophical conversations. She also has a really open mind and has dated people of my ethnicity before, which is fairly unusual where she lives.


This is the first time I've ever developed feelings for someone after not seeing them in person for a while; I'm just not sure how to proceed given all of this - to go for it or not, to keep the feelings or forget them, and maybe how to gauge where things are before I meet her in person. Any advice would be appreciated...

I wake up around 7am, drink a cup of coffee and I won’t eat until 2 or 3Pm and it’s just a light snack.  I’m usually not hungry in the morningsz

Then I eat a big dinner.

Then around 830-9pm I take my sleeping meds and when I get sleep, I get so freakin hungry. It’s what I’m sure having the munchies feels like and I can snack forever.  I’ll even wake up at 2am and down some leftovers and a full bag of chips.

It’s almost like I can’t stop it. The hunger is out of control and I have to satisfy it.

Anyone had an issue like this before?",1,1735617159.0,diet,5,1.0,False

1hq62ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestosmanifested/comments/1hq62ri/the_incel_doctrine_as_written_by_jay/,The Incel Doctrine as Written by Jay,"In my experience, An incel is only a complete deterent to society if 
A. He bases his whole personality on his rejections.
B. He starts every interaction refering to himself as an incel.
C. He goes off on rants about redpill v bluepill v blackpill or related topics without reading the room.
D. He is hateful of women for rejecting especially him if he himself is not a peacable man.

In my experience inceldom is just a phase, A chrisalis if you will; a part of our lives that will one day no longer exist. Every man must be prepared to enter that phase, as he must also be prepared to leave it, given he finds lasting love and friendships.
A major point many fail to see when looking at incels is that there are two types of incels. Incels by culture, and incels by circumstance. Incels by culture are, of course, the very thing we as society think of when we hear the word. They are often defined as a subculture of internet users, most commonly found on reddit, 4chan and discord. They can be described as hateful, misogynistic, rageful, spiteful, and manically depressed individuals, typically straight men between the ages of 17 and 45. Most incels by culture, are of the belief that losing their virginity is of the utmost priority, and that they are superior to women, wronged by women in society through constant rejection, and because of this, a great injustice has befallen men in the world. They preach that men are victims in society and that women and womens rights are a blight on the world, a leech on society, because it gives them the freedom and the power to abuse, reject and belittle men. Because of this idea, these incels believe whole heartedly that they are owed sexual reparations by women typically in the form of rape, assault, pedophelia and the like, while also believing that if left alone with a woman, they could be falsely accused of rape, or assault and everyone would automatically believe the woman over the man because of how feminism has made women out to be the victims in society, thus allowing women to feel empowered when men suffer in any way shape or form. Now, in my experience most incels are all bark no bite, with a handful of exceptions, and by exceptions i mean men who grope randoms in public, men who have committed violent misogenous crimes such as those of Elliot Roger or Nazi Scott, and men who go out of their way to bully and berate women, lgbtq members, attractive men, couples and feminists. These incels by culture are toxic and perhaps even broken beyond repair. Only a miracle could save such a wretch from a cold dark fate of self destruction, eternal lonliness, or acts of terror.

Now, we begin to digress from the dark side of inceldom and focus on who i was and who the majority of single men truely are: incels by circumstance. To understand this properly we must take the very definition of incel back to its roots. Incel is merely an abreviation of the words Involuntarily Celibate. This means that these men are merely single, lonely, and unattractive. A majority of all incels are only incels by circumstance and not by culture which means that most of them arent actually mysogenists, racists, or homophobic, seeing as that would automatically place them in the incel by culture category, but most incels are merely missunderstood and lonely, just trying to live their lives. They dont have many real friends if any, and no special lady to love, but they dont blame society for their lack of relationship, as distraught as they are, rather, incels by circumstance retain their human decency and dont feel the need to lash out at women who reject them. Often they will retreat into themselves for emotional compensation, taking their emotions out on themselves to avoid hurting the people around them, as well as using humor, often dark or edgy humor, as a coping mechanism. Incels by circumstance can be found in every corner of the world, from the single class clown in college, to that dorky guy at mcdonalds who sits in the corner working on his laptop, to that one autistic grad student at your church who doesnt want college, and is trying hard to make a career out of music production, to just your average joe workin full time at starbucks to pay the bills. Now, there is one key difference between an incel by circumstance and merely just a single man. That key difference is that a single man may have friends or be content being single, or he wants a relationship but is not lonely or in dire need of companionship. To a single man, a girlfriend is desirable, but not necessary to live a fulfilling life. 

I notice that incels of either side of the spectrum complain a great deal that theyre lonely purely becsuse no one talks to them and no one will approach them to make conversation but there is one very large problem with that, and it is that going up, taking initiative and making that first step is not initially the responsibility of others. It is the responsibility of the incel by circumstance to face the world and greet it with a smile, and by that i mean he must put himself out there, so to speak. In order to do that, he must first be made approachable. He must dress presentably, have good hygene, have attainable standards, and speak as one who is respectful and peaceable, while also having wit and humor. No one is going to want a lazy slob drenched in cheeto dust with holes growing in his sweatpants. He may feel free to wear that alone at home gaming, but when out and about, clean attire and hygene are paramount. If hes made it this far then now, he must learn to approach as approachable. It helps to wear a loose smile. At this point, whether he is attempting to make friends or impress a woman in order to eventually invite her to coffee, different people have different methods and the best thing he could do is be himself, while throwing respect, wit and confidence into the mix. If he is able to engage in a conversation, he has proved himself an interesting and sociable person. From there life can finally fully spread its wings, as the now incel turned man can build relationships and friendships. Endless possibilities open up to reveal all that life can offer. Theres much more to it than all this though. If you, my reader, wish to become the man described in this manifesto, follow these instructions to the letter, and perhaps also read Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for life, as it contains vital information to consistantly live out your life as this ideal go-getter guy. Now to the few women who may be reading this and perhaps feel left out, Im sure that someone has written an equivalent of this for women. I will point out not nearly as many femcels exist as there are incels, though i hear numbers are on the rise. i hope someone brings them a self-help manifesto to clear up the stigma and keep femceldom from being anything other than a phase, as i have written my manifesto to aid my lonely brothers. I pray no one finds fault in my writings, as my aspirations of a nobel peace prize may be undermined, should some poor ignorant find offense, or even a reputable scholar find error in my ideals. Regardless, i sincierely hope this reaches the right people. Peace to you.

- Jay

I'm a 40 year old man living in South Korea. My wife and I have two children. A major point of contention we have been having is that her family stays fairly often at our home once a month or every other month and stay 1 week at a time and don't really have concepts of personal boundaries. The issue is that I feel like a guest in my own home. My in laws sometimes take liberties and reorganize our home etc. My wife usually just allows them to do this. My father in law will try to come into my business and help arrange. My mother in law tries to take over the kitchen and I had to wait for around an 1 before I could cook dinner after I got home last night. I tried to drink a bit of rum with her dad and her dad tried to give my 1 year old a drop of it . When I was sitting down to eat the mother in law hit my cat because he was snacking on some food. Things like this I've been trying to let my wife make some hard lines drawn, but every time she ignores or minimizes my concerns or makes excuses.

In Korean culture age is very big and I have really tried to be understanding but I feel like I've lost myself. The breaking point is that this morning I was a bit rushed to try to get to work. I wanted to just sit down for 1 or 2 minutes to take a few sips of coffee but my mother in law kept wanting my wife and I to get on our hands and knees and bow to them as part of new years tradition. Usually in Korea that is done on Lunar New Year which is a month away. I did it last year and have done it other years out of respect. But as I said, it's usually not first thing in the morning like this. It felt like a bit of a power move and I just woke up and I had to make my line in the sand and said no. I explained that since they were guests they shouldn't be making such demands even though this is their country, it's still me and my wife's place.

I explained that yes this is their country, I also have a right to my own way of living. I feel like culture is being used as excuse to justify rude and selfish behavior. Culturally South Korea is also extremely male dominated. Culturally it's usually the women that "" marry into "" the husband's side of the family. AITAH for making a stand here?

Well, as I was driving her to her sleep study, I told her I’d like to help but I could only commit to 1 day a week, and that she should schedule her appointments later so we could avoid traffic. She ghosted me for 2 days, then dropped a nuclear bomb of a text ending with this:

“You won’t like this, but I’m wondering if you are drinking alone at night and have to nurse a hangover in the mornings.”

She also said she’d arranged alternative transportation and wouldn’t ask for my help at all (yay!). Then said I’d “abandoned” her, and I have no empathy. Lots of triggering shit. I popped an Ativan and as soon as I stopped shaking, I recognized this for the gift that it is. We’ve never been close, and I always did things for her out of a sense of duty.

Here is a recap since my last entry. We did make it to Hawaii for his sabbatical. I booked the airbnbs. His parents joined us for a week. We still fought a lot. He threatened to smack me at one point on the beach while we were arguing, we were on day 2 of him being pissy with me over not having thought of every minute detail specifically a waterproof pouch so we could carry the car keys with us snorkeling. We had been hiding them in the muffler… 

He caught a cold a day after that so i still took care of him. He was nice to be when he was better. Still we may have had sex twice tops over the entire 4 weeks and it was a quick “get on top” session. Zero passion, just checking the box.

The rest of the fall he took multiple business trips, we hosted his work friend, some of his family. I did a weekend at the bench for Caeley’s bachelorette thing. The best times were while we were away from each other. He just treats me like I’m his maid, my only purpose is to make him meals and do his laundry. I’m grateful he has a nice career and pays the bills, he always reminds me of how great a life I have. 

Since he told me to lose weight this year I got down and maintained 135. I’m 5’4. 

He didn’t hesitate to let me know I was 125 when we met…i was 22. 
 He reminded me of that over Christmas at his brothers house.

He never stops talking about how there is nothing for him in NC, and how much he hates it here. I have listened to his silver tongue enough to know he just wants to isolate me from everyone and everything. He takes all my energy and I am constantly in a hyper vigilant state of mind for the next thing he says to me. “Don’t react, I say to myself”…

This was our 11th Christmas together and out of the last 10 years I have had to buy and wrap all of my own gifts, along with his and anyone else we buy for.

While in Boston on our last day with his brother we visited a Christmas market, i ask led him multiple times to come help me pick out and ornament so we could get our names on it together. He declined and made an excuse and told me to just go get what I wanted. This was an opportunity for us to connect, even his brother caught on and say “i would have done it dude”. I gave up and walked around the market finding some nice glass ornaments, I didn’t ask him if he liked them I just bought a couple. 

I tried to talk to him the night before, he asked what was wrong - i knew i shouldn’t have expressed my feelings about his making comments in front of his family about how NC sucks. Ofcourse then that started a ln entire dialogue about me being in the wrong because he has lived here for 10 yrs taking care of me and now it’s time to move on. He doesn’t think it’s fair. 

I told him I already moved away once for him and he ruined it. He betrayed my trust and killed my spirit. And then blamed me for gaining weight. 

I am so done. Mentally, spiritually, emotionally I am death. I am lonely. 

I am applying to jobs. He doesn’t want me to become financially independent. God forbid i leave him and it makes him look bad! That’s all he cares about is optics. His insecurities grow by the day. His hair, his body, his aging. I could have cared less about any of that. I loved him. And I have spent the past year grieving a love that once was. It makes me sick. I asked him multiple times for counseling, he declines. 

It will soon be too late. 

I currently have a sore throat. I still invited him to go on a 4 mile walk with me but he chose to walk 20 yards behind me. Probably because i wasn’t talking much… but what is there to talk about? Every time i try to talk to him he just makes it about him. He rarely validates my feelings. It’s easy for him to come and make an empty apology, but then he will do the same thing again in a week or so. God why am I with this person!

I’m tired of feeling like I have to do everything. Yesterday he said he needed to “train” me to stop thinking he needed to apologize and come to me first. I’m so sick of this.

We have been fighting on and off for a few days. We had an international diamond club trip planned but I came down with Covid and that threw a wrench in everything. It was supposed to be May 28-June 9th. My birthday comes along and he tells me it’s just another day and we don’t have anything planned in leu of the diamond club trip. Instead he prioritizes something with work - a bid deal he needed to pull in when we were already supposed to be on vacation. He tells me I don’t do anything to contribute to our relationship and I guess I am coming to the realization that he has already chipped so much of me away emotionally that I just have stopped caring.  He has hurt me so much emotionally and mentally that I will be seeking therapy for myself. I wish he would just tell me he doesn’t want to do this anymore. I was too young when we met and he should have never married me so young. I never had a chance to have a career and finish finding myself. He has taken that from me. Now he believes its time for him to only think of himself….. that what he has always done… that’s what he did when he left me in Hawaii, that’s what he did when he reached out to his ex, and had all those conversations with other women. The disrespect was there and just unforgivable

Justin came home from New Orleans last Friday. He has been guarded and has avoided telling me about any late night happenings with his business people in NOLA. I checked into it and found a text thread with someone named Ana, sharing a personal photo of himself in Hawaii. I am once again disgusted. Looks like her name is Ana, but the dates on the text thread are after he came home…. Why does he need to text with other women knowing that he isn’t going to see them again?


9/21/2022
Last night after dinner we were in the kitchen. There was a show on TV and they were talking about kids with knives. Justin remarked “I would never let my kid have a knife” I responded with disbelief “what? Why not?? I would let him have everything, guns, knives, bows - just like I did when I was young and would teach him how to use these things”….  He then turned to me and said “well with your anger issues and my (insert description) it just wouldn’t be a good combo and something bad would probably happen. 

My response to his last sentence was defensive. I felt attacked and accused. I said something along the lines of “wtf no I don’t have anger issues, if I do they are because of you” to which he went further to explain that my WHOLE family says that I need anger management…ie my grandparents who really just say that to tease me. He is using that to justify his attack on me for what ever reason. He is not justified and yes I am going to react negatively and feel the need to defend myself. I started to go off on him and get more defensive, cussing etc..  he finally left the room. I took a shower and laid in bed pissed off and feeling alone as usual. He did come over and tried to ask me what was wrong (as if he didn’t know he was the catalyst). I began to tell him that he should not have criticized me and that I feel like I have to always defend myself….He then completely dismissed everything I was trying to say and then made the whole fight about him (playing the victim) and said I ruined the evening???? Then said I was acting like his mom which is the last person I would ever want to be


Perhaps I am defensive - but WHY…. 


I never used to blow up like this in the past in previous relationships. I made sure to let Justin know this as well. 

HE IS CRITICAL and makes foolish statements. He also says things in an accusatory way. 

These journal entries may not fix everything but they will show me a pattern on what is going on. I do plan to write down my feelings indefinitely for self reflection. 

Let me be clear also as to why I am also on edge. I do still feel betrayed. over this past year more so than ever. I put up with him being so critical for so long and now he is finally seeing the long-term damage it has caused me. I am more on edge and I am immediatly defensive.  Justin put so much emotional and physical stress on me this year and defended his actions by comparing them to his own work life stressors. 

I was in the middle of a major project this spring. Literally building a 10x16 greenhouse by myself and racing to get it done before we went on a 2 week long trip. I needed to finish it before we left, BEFORE the hot weather came. Justin decided to make his spring project my problem by picking out various trees to be planted in our yard.. 

I told him it was the wrong time to be planting trees, he would not listen. I also told him that the trees he was choosing were massive and would be hard to plant. He said “I will dig the holes” ……. I also told him that planting these trees would make the yard harder to mow and would be more work for me in the long run. He could care less about my concerns and went ahead and ordered 5 massive trees  balled & burlapped. Oh but I should be happy that my husband wants to help me beautify the yard….

Once the trees were here they needed to be planted immediately, Justin tried to dig a hole but was unsuccessful because NC has concrete like clay and rocks instead of normal dirt. The urgency o the trees now became my problem. I asked a neighbor to dig the holes but he didn’t have access to his backhoe.. So I finally found someone local with a mini excavator to dig the holes. They came, they dug and they left. We paid them. 

At this point the trees had been sitting on the ground for 4-5 days. Justin had been begging the nursery to hurry up and deliver them without even knowing when they could be put into the ground. 

Now to plant the trees was a whole other process. I had to lift each one with the tractor using a chain. The whole while Justin is sneering at me and rolling his eyes each time the tree would move or jerk in the wrong direction. I absolutely HATE the way he treats me when I am helping him do something. Im pretty sure I quit at some point and went inside. He wanted the tree to sit just perfect and face the right way in the hole, then we had to cut the wire and remove the burlap. Any little thing that would happen was automatically  my fault and I was supposed to be more careful handing the removal of burlap. What the actual fuckKK!!
This was not a happy time, it was stressful and I felt criticized and hated the entire process. I never want to do another project with him because of this. We cursed the entire time. 

The next day went a little smoother and we got the rest of the trees in the ground. All of this work and stress and emotional abuse he gave me was now justified because “it made the driveway look better” I just agreed with him to make his efforts not feel in vain. I could give a shit less what it looks like and now I just have more trees to mow around. 

Oh and my greenhouse still wasn’t finished. 

He continued to order more trees (small ones) but still shit that I had to deal with. 

God forbid I asked him to help me hold up one board so I could attach it. I ended up pulling a muscle in my chest because of this. An 8ft long 2x6 to be clear. 

It was starting to heat up outside temperature-wise. I was putting the siding on the greenhouse and getting it closed in. We were a week or so from our trip. I was so stressed out working by myself trying to hurry up, trying to be a wife, trying to manage the chores, the dogs and deal with an all around un-happy, critical ungrateful husband.

His order of plants/trees arrived via Fedex while I was working out back. It was hot outside. They sat outside for maybe 15 minutes and he comes down from his office looking all pissed off because I didn’t bring these items inside right away and unpack them for him… I am literally on a ladder working on a small roof when he comes to put the plants in the garage and is throwing boxes and basically having a pity party. I ask him what the hell is wrong, what now. Oh did I to do something else not right for you?? At this point I’m pissed off that he is pissed off and he is blaming me for something stupid. we yell, we scream. He doesn’t acknowledge how tired and worn out I am. He doesn’t see me. I am just a spoiled house wife to him. I am lazy. I don’t pay attention. I am a dependent. Worthless. I walk up to him and slap myself in the face multiple times and tell him that’s what he wishes he could do since he hates me so much. I am seeing red at this point and decide to leave the house. I leave everything on the table including my phone. I get in the car and drive away. 20 minutes to chik fil a parking lot sobbing like a fucking child. They ice cream cone is the only thing to soothe my red hot face and emotions. I sit there by myself sobbing for 2 hours. Wanting to get on a plane and disappear forever. start my life over and never have to deal with someone like HIM again. 

I return home after 2-3 hours or so. Still feeling like shit. Having had no contact with anyone during that time I realize he has alerted the neighborhood to my absence. He went driving around looking for me. 
I feel he is much more concerned for the way this looks on him rather than the actual damage to our relationship. I don’t speak to him that night. I really don’t remember what was said or how we even made up. we left for a trip and spent 2 weeks in Hawaii.

We had a good time there and I tried to forget the series of events leading up to our trip. Until the last night in Hawaii he decided to ditch me at our hotel and not come back until 3am. He lied to me about his whereabouts, was drunk and went to bed. 

Months later in august/sept I i notice he is texting a lot to other people. I notice the name Cody Autodesk and think its someone from his work as the name implies. But my gut feeling gets the best of me so I investigate and find out that he is texting with another woman - the woman stripper he met on our last night in Hawaii and decided to keep in fucking touch with. He partied with her that night instead of me. INSTEAD OF HIS WIFE. AND kept in touch with her.  I also see that its not just her but another nightlife worker from Nashville, he went to another stripclub after our vacation and made up a story about how it wasn’t a great time and it was his co-workers fault. But he still got that girls phone number and was texting with her about helping her get a job in the tech industry. 
Both of these text threads were confusing to me. He told them he was traveling all over the world, was planning to buy a house in Hawaii, wanted to meet for coffee sometime, wanted to send the girl in Hawaii a necklace for being to helpful and nice to him. This was a total slap in the face and betrayal. 

I confronted him. He lied to me and tried to make up a story to get out of it. HE LIES SO BAD. 

At this point I want a divorce.  Want to disappear. I want to leave him to talk to these other  women and however many others there are. OH an I found out he was also texting back and forth with one of his ex-girl friends. Total bullshit!. She was sending him pictures and I did see a nude pic of her in his recently deleted. 

His computer contained ALOT of porn and links to different sites for porn. 

He swears he never physically cheated on me, but what man would admit to cheating? 

A few more weeks goes by and things are ok. I try to move past all the nonsense and try to forget. 

One day I get a notification that he is on snapchat…… I investigate and find he has two accounts. “Modelwithbigdck” and “Jessime”. Both accounts have the same people pretty much. “Nikki Nixon” I find out is his Ex gf Charlene (Charmaine asegurado). he claims these are fake accounts to which he was using to prank people with especially his ex for sending naked pics - what ever.   Before confronting him I did make  fake account a requested pics from the “model” acct. he sent a fake picture of some random guy. So stupid.  I feel like he was suspicious of my fake account so he sent a fake pic. He had other porn star women on his snap chat also Lucy Thai and Chloe armour… I don’t care if he wants to look at content. It just proves he is fcked up. 

Days go by and I see he is using snap chat while he is alone, doing his “workout”. I finally get so fed up that I start hunting for more hidden social media accounts and hack one of his gmail accounts. This sends a notification to his phone and he confronts me….the audacity!  

This gets turned on him very quickly and he completely denies having any snapchat. What a fucking liar. 

We fight for the rest of the night. I leave and come back. Etc etc. 

He says enough to justify his social media, admits to everything, makes up a story to justify having it blah blah. 


At this point I am tired. I am on edge. I am angry. we move past this and I try to let things go back to normal. He says all the right things, comforts me, talks to me about future plans, says work Is stressful - all the same bullshit. 


No wonder I am so fucking angry and on edge. He thinks I am just going to forget all the multiple times he has betrayed me and lied to my face after forgiving him and trying to move on. He will not acknowledge my requests for a marriage counselor or therapy. He acts like since he didn’t physically cheat on me that I shouldn’t be angry about anything and should just be happy because I have such a perfect life. On the inside I just want to scream. 

Now he has a work trip planned for NOLA. I was originally going to go with him down there but just a couple days ago he began making  reasons for me not to go - like I don’t already know what to expect. He says its a lot of his customers and I won’t be doing much but sitting in a hotel room all day. So instead I am now going to stay with family and am taking all the dogs with me on a 6.5hr drive to VA. He is going to NOLA for 4-5 nights and will likely doing some stupid shit. I am so sick of this. He should be taking me with him because he knows I don’t trust him.

1hq5uy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1hq5uy1/a_real_solution/,A real solution,"I'll cut to the chase.
Terrible insomnia for many years, getting around 3-5 hrs a night. Yall know the life.

Recently found a real solution thats been working for me, been getting 6-8hrs for the last 4 weeks.

Made a few small changes, and one big change. 

THE BIG CHANGE
In the morning, whenever the hell i wake up. I have to go outside, walk 3 blocks to buy a cup of coffee, then spend about 2 mins stareing at the sun and drinking my coffee. If i didnt sleep then i do it at 8:30am which is my desired wake up time.

On saterdays if i wake up at noon, then i do it at noon.

Within a few days of this there was a dramatic change. I get so tierd at night and just clock out without even noticeing.

Useing the sun + coffee to 'trigger' my brain into understanding when morning is, was the key.

SMALLER CHANGES
-The youtube channel ""fearless sleep"" was wonderful for helping with sleep anxiety
-Drinking shit loads of water during the day also helped alot
-stopping all the drugs and sleeping pills also helped as my brain was pretty fried from the cocktails i was useing to force myself asleep
-no weed after 8pm. This helped with morning grogginess. I know i just said I stopped drugs, but hey ya boi's gotta smoke


I hope this helps someone. Its such a simple trick but it worked, and in my years of research and suffering, nobody has fucking suggested this.

Im a WFH peon so ofcourse i wasent getting enough sun in the morning. Kicking myself for not realizeing this sooner.

Cheers homies

1hq5uvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1hq5uvm/first_long_fast_36_hrs_experience_report/,First long fast (36 hrs) (experience report),"I started toying with IF something like 8 years ago, and I really enjoyed it for many years. Generally I'd do a 16-20 hour IF during work days and I found I felt really good doing it. Then as I got a bit older, I noticed it was impacting my sleep. I would wake up in the middle of the night and then not fall back asleep. This was unacceptable so I had to stop IF.

Given the above, I've been curious about doing longer fasts instead during periods where I don't necessarily need a good sleep, like during the holidays. This led to me doing a 36 hour fast the past couple of days which is the longest I have gone and the first time I've exceeded the 23/24 hour mark.

I have to say that even though I feel really good IF with respect to energy levels, mental clarity etc., this 36 hour fast was instead a bit of a rollercoaster. In preparation for the fast I ate *mostly* low carb the day before, having a piece of healthier toast in the morning but otherwise eating low carb foods. Ideally I would have spent a few days eating low carb but due to timing I was only able to get the one day in. I slept like a baby that night, perhaps too well, waking up with a headache that I often get when over-sleeping. It could also have been from dehydration, since I was in bed for so long and didn't wake to drink any water.

Regardless of my headache I planned to go ahead with the fast, and made black coffee and drank some water with electrolytes - I use 'Concetrace Trace Minerals' on the regular in my water anyway, so I felt this would mostly cover me for the fast as well with respect to electrolytes, but I was too light on this stuff at first and so partway through the day I realized I had to step it up after noticing some light headedness, which helped me feel better for a bit. 

From then on there were moments I felt really good, similar to how I've felt during IF, almost like I was on a stimulant or something - music sounded better, my senses seemed more in tuned, I was less anxious than normal, etc. - but it seemed like that would last for about an hour and then I would feel weak and tired again, sometimes with light nausea (which admittedly could have been from my playing VR). These two states would flip flop through the day but I realize I was playing catch up with my electrolytes due to the misstep at the beginning.

In the early evening, probably around the 22 hour mark, I noticed another odd sensation - pins and needles in my left arm, like it was falling asleep despite my not being in any weird positions. I read a few ancedotes on it and noticed that people associated it with either too much or too little potassium, and so I took a hard look at my trace mineral drops I was relying on and realized that there was very little potassium. I immediately went out to walmart and bought some cream of tarter which seemed to somewhat set me right. I played video games for a couple of hours and then figured I would try to sleep, so I popped a magnesium pill and went to bed.

Sleep did not come easy, as I suspected. I was pretty awake still about an hour after my usual bed time but was just groggy enough to turn off the lights and give it a try. It took me about an hour but I did fall asleep for 1-2 hours, then woke up wide awake once again. I immediately took a melatonin but it seemed to have almost zero effect, oddly enough. It would be an estimated 2 hours before I fell back asleep, and then woke again quite early, but it was close enough to my normal wake time that I decided to get up.

I had a hunger pang initially but had a couple of hours to wait until the 36 hour mark, I pushed through and it passed quickly. I felt I could have easily kept fasting but I wanted to spend the day refeeding so that I could go out tomorrow for NYE. I started with a couple fork-fulls of sauerkraut and let it sit. I was a bit nauseous again this morning but not too bad. The kraut seemed to sit well with me so an hour later I ate an avocado with a spoonful of cottage cheese for protein. Again I had no particular stomach issues, but the entire time I was feeling very strange - not hungry at all, but also not satiated or energized, and ever so slightly nauseous. I *thought* that refeeding would make me feel very energetic, almost wired, but I was pretty fatigued and out of it all day. A couple hours passed and I decided to eat something more substantial so I made eggs with broccoli. 

A couple hours later still, I felt well enough to go for a quick workout so I did so without straining myself too hard, then got home and had cottage cheese and blueberries. Not immediately after eating but sometime this afternoon, I continued to experience nausea and mild light headedness, as well as bouts of feeling super tired but not really being able to sleep due to feeling 'not myself', so I sort of half-napped for the rest of the afternoon.

By dinner time I finally felt actual hunger again, and so I had more eggs with riced cauliflower. I wasn't planning on it, but for dessert I did have some chocolate and a high protein cookie - probably 30 grams of sugar in total over the course of 5 hours. I think I was just looking to feel normal again by eating something sweet / typical for me, and I have to say at this point, I am feeling more or less back to baseline. I can tell I didn't get a full night's sleep, though, so should sleep well.

So there you have it - successful overall, but I am surprised at how rocky the experience was. Next time I have a go, I am going to try eating a keto diet for 2-3 days before the fast starts, and will be supplementing more electrolytes leading into and during the fast. I am hoping those two actions help resolve some of the uncomfortable sensations I experienced during the fast.",3,1735616418.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

If you have a question for a specific mod, please feel free to ping/summon us by typing in a u/ followed immediately by our usernames - just keep in mind that you can only summon a maximum of three people per comment.

With this reminder of who we are, please comment with your questions below! Check out the top stickied comment for some general rules, but most of all we hope you have fun getting to know us a little better. 😊

    Regarding inactive mods - modding is a hobby or volunteer project, we all have lives outside of Reddit and sometimes we need a break, or our attention is needed elsewhere, we get kidnapped by a pack of howler monkeys.. any number of good reasons for being away for a bit. That doesn't necessarily mean inactive mods won't be back or are not contributing behind the scenes. Please respect our mod's privacy.

**General Rules for the NToR AMA**

    No Doxxing questions. We're excited to answer questions that help you get to know more about us. However, we will not be revealing our names or specific locations, or other information that we're not already comfortable answering. If you ask a question that we're not comfortable answering, we'll let you know. Please be respectful and leave it at that.
    
    All questions must be Safe for Work. We in general keep away from NSFW topics in NewToReddit, and this AMA is not any different. Any NSFW questions will be removed.
    
    Please don't spam the comments. If you have multiple questions, that's great! We're so happy to hear that! But please try to fit them into a single comment if you can. Exceptions to this are if you're trying to ask specific questions to more than 3 of us (which will require multiple comments, or we won't get the notification), or if you think of another question hours after you've posted your first one. As mentioned above, this will be open for a few days, so that would not be considered spamming ;-)
    
    It should go without mentioning (but we'll spell it out anyway) that the rules of our weekly general chat thread apply, this is not the place for questions about how Reddit works or debating the pros and cons of voting, minimum requirements, karma, etc. This is a chance to ask us about our favorite sports teams and what we like on our pizza.",2,1735616165.0,NewToReddit,0,1.0,False

Over the next few days, Grace and I fell into this easy rhythm, texting about the most random things —books we were hooked on, movies that had us in stitches, just the usual day-to-day stuff. It all felt incredibly natural, like we’d known each other for years, not just days.

Our post-church coffee dates soon evolved into something more meaningful. She started checking in on me, seeing how I was adjusting to living alone, and those small gestures became surprisingly important. Before long, she was popping over with warm cookies fresh from the oven, promising a quick visit that invariably stretched into hours of comfortable conversation.

We’d sometimes tackle little projects around my place—fixing a leaky faucet, rearranging the living room—while also diving into deeper discussions. She’d share stories about growing up in a very religious household, while I offered my more skeptical perspective on faith. We even joked about the epidemic of commitment-phobia in the modern dating scene.

One night, we were curled up on my couch with mugs of hot cocoa, the kind of evening that felt impossibly cozy, when Grace said something that stopped me in my tracks.

“You know,” she began, her cheeks turning a little pink, “I’ve never actually been in a serious relationship.”

“Wait, never?” I asked, trying not to sound too surprised.

She shrugged, fiddling with her mug. “I mean, I’ve dated here and there, but nothing ever really clicked. My parents always drilled into me this idea of waiting for someone who truly gets me—someone who respects my values. And honestly? That person just hasn’t come along yet.”

Her voice was steady, but there was this hint of vulnerability that hit me. I could tell she was watching my reaction, so I kept my tone light.

“Well,” I said with a grin, “sounds like the guys around here have no idea what they’re missing. That’s entirely their loss.”

She smiled at that, but there was still a flicker of doubt in her eyes. “Maybe,” she said quietly. “Or maybe I’m just... too much for most people. I have certain standards, and they’re not exactly popular these days.”

“What kind of standards?” I asked, genuinely curious.

She hesitated, like she wasn’t sure how I’d take it. Then, with a deep breath, she said, “I’ve decided to wait until marriage.”

I’ll admit, it caught me off guard. It wasn’t something I’d heard often, especially in today’s world. But instead of brushing it off or making a joke—which, let’s be honest, the old me might’ve done—I just nodded, letting it sink in.

“Fair enough,” I said after a moment. “I mean, that’s not exactly common these days, but it’s... kind of refreshing.”

Her expression softened, and I could see the relief in her eyes. “You think so?”

“Yeah,” I said, meaning it. “You know who you are and what you want. That’s rare. And honestly? It makes you stand out in the best way.”

She smiled then, this genuine, warm smile that made my chest tighten. Grace wasn’t like anyone I’d ever met—and that’s what made her so damn special.",4,1735616040.0,stories,1,1.0,False

GF said yes. We went out for Starbucks, then headed home. I thanked her for the wonderful time over text.


She already wants to kiss me tomorrow, but I’m not sure if we’re moving too fast or if it’s okay.



She told me it was because her online friend (17F) told her that she should kiss her crush (me) to reduce tension and to “solidify the relationship” so it’s not just “friends with a crush going out to hang out”.

Disclaimer : I am not a lawyer but I play one in my games. 

**Copywrite** 

Here’s a general list of activities that can be classified as copyright infringement in the USA and international trading partners. These activities violate the rights of a copyright holder if done without proper licensing or permissions and used to generate a profit based on their creative works without permission from the owner of the intellectual property.  

•	Reproducing copyrighted material.

•	Distributing copyrighted material.

•	Performing or displaying copyrighted works publicly.

•	Creating derivative works.

•	Using copyrighted material in commercial settings.

•	Plagiarism or misrepresentation.

•	Downloading or streaming from licensed sources.

•	Copying software or digital content.

•	Unauthorized use of copyrighted material on social media.

•	Selling or distributing counterfeit goods:

**Fair Use**

Fair Use is governed by federal copyright law (17 U.S. Code § 107) and applies uniformly across the United States, and most international trading partners. Under this law, the following uses are typically considered Fair Use, though each case is subject to specific evaluation based on its circumstances:

•	Criticism and Commentary: Using copyrighted material for the purpose of critique or commentary (e.g., quoting from a book in a review).

•	News Reporting: Incorporating copyrighted material as part of reporting on current events.

•	Teaching and Education: Using copyrighted works in a nonprofit educational setting, such as in classroom instruction or research.

•	Parody: Transforming copyrighted works into parodies that provide social commentary or humor.

•	Scholarship and Research: Using excerpts of copyrighted materials for academic or scholarly purposes.

•	Transformative Use: Creating a work that adds new meaning, expression, or purpose to the original copyrighted material (e.g., remixing or repurposing content).

•	Incidental or Accidental Inclusion: Displaying copyrighted material incidentally in the background of an image or video, without it being the primary focus.

•	Personal Use (Limited): Reproducing copyrighted works for strictly personal purposes (e.g., time-shifting TV shows), though this doesn't always qualify under Fair Use.

•	Use in Legal Proceedings: Quoting or reproducing copyrighted material for evidence in court or other legal contexts.

•	Noncommercial Use: Instances where the use doesn't have a direct commercial benefit and minimally impacts the market value of the original work.

**Factors Evaluated in Fair Use:**

1.	Purpose and Character of Use: Whether the use is for commercial or nonprofit educational purposes and whether it is transformative.

2.	Nature of the Copyrighted Work: Whether the work is more factual or creative, with factual works being more likely to qualify.

3.	Amount and Substantiality: The quantity and significance of the portion used in relation to the entire work.

4.	Effect on the Market: Whether the use negatively impacts the market value or potential earnings of the original work.

**Good General Rules when producing fan related materials.**  

1)  When creating homebrew anything, it is best not to include the Hasbro Copywrite on it anywhere. Best that you have your own tag and mark it as such. 

2)  When creating homebrew anything, it is best to produce similar in style, but not exactly the same so that the content cannot be misconstrued as official. 

3)  When creating homebrew anything, understand that all aspects of the graphic design style are part of the brand. The boarders, background, framing, presentation, and compositional elements are all part of the graphic design style. You can tweak them change them and alter them to suit as long as they are not direct lifts.  

4)  When making homebrew anything do not solicit payment for them. Asking for donations, Coffee, or any other sort of remuneration can cause issues especially if you are using resources from the PDF files issued by the copywrite holder. 

5)  When electronically distributing homebrew anything include your disclaimer tag denoting that the content is not intended as a challenge to the copywrite holder.

I sent her some cheesy coffee-related pickup line, then asked her if she wanted to go to Starbucks, since she said she likes it.


GF said yes. We went out for Starbucks, then headed home. I thanked her for the wonderful time over text.


She already wants to kiss me tomorrow, but I’m not sure if we’re moving too fast or if it’s okay.



She told me it was because her online friend (17F) told her that she should kiss her crush (me) to reduce tension and to “solidify the relationship” so it’s not just “friends with a crush going out to hang out”.


I mean, I love her so much, but we just started dating. Should I kiss her or wait a little bit? And how long into the relationship would a kiss be okay?

I believe her because I love her and believe she's not a liar. But I'd like to know the perspective of others as well. I can't add photos but I will type some of the messages here.

1hq5bgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tiki/comments/1hq5bgg/espresso_martini_but_make_it_tiki/,Espresso Martini - but make it tiki?,"Came up with the idea of a tiki-ish Espresso Martini while searching for ingredients for the classic version. Personally, I love an aged rum (or whiskey, or añejo tequila, or... basically anything other than vodka in my espresso martinis) and figured something a bit more tropical wouldn't be a reach on the premise that a more festive liqueur would be an easy substitute, so I gave this build a shot:

- 1.5 oz El Dorado 3 year
- .75 oz Giffard Banane du Brasil liqueur 
- 1 oz Cold brew concentrate (Tropical Standard method)
- .25 oz cane syrup 

Method: shake with ice, serve up.

Verdict: overally, fairly pleasing, but I'm going to work on this a bit. Wishing I had fresh pulled espresso for this one - the cold brew definitely brought strong, delightful coffee flavor, but it assuredly lacks the body of espresso and masked the banana more than I would have liked. Intuition is to use a darker rum in the future too, if only for a deeper color, if nothing else. I'd also be keen to up the volume of rum since the total output was a bit petite. Giffard was plenty sweet on it's own, so I'll leave the syrup out next time.

Anyway - r/tiki, know any good tiki-ish Espresso Martini riffs you favor I could use for inspiration?",5,1735614702.0,Tiki,9,1.0,False

I am considering going on tirzepatide I just would like some insight on if I would be a good candidate.

1hq5a6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/1hq5a6k/i_miss_my_friend/,i miss my friend ,"i had a friend, her name was Sally. She was amazing. even though I live in America and she lived in Saudi Arabia we learned we had a lot in common with one another. We both like anime, coffee, music, and just having a great time. The one thing that we both shared was our love for poetry. As writers we both wrote great poetry and hers was truly amazing. Hers was probably objectively better in terms of how structured and appealing it was. Regardless on who was better or not, we both had a passion for poetry and shared it. She was a great friend, mind you I only known her for 6 months. But I could tell I could share anything with her and vice versa. For this life has good people and bad people among them that's life. however, among the two people, there are also monsters. we both are victims of bad people but even monsters. i would say she was more hurt than I was and it was apparent in the way she wrote to the guards she had for her emotions. 

the problem was her monsters were those she lived with. her own family, people who aren't supposed to be monsters but were. From calling her useless and belittling her to the point she found no escape....  
she committed suicide 2 weeks ago because of not only her family but other things that hurt her. i wish she didn't and maybe she is still alive, I don't know only God knows. regardless of whether or not she did kill herself or not she is not around anymore.  What makes matters worse, I only known her as Sally, no last name no picture, no other friends, and I don't even know what she sounded like. the only things I have of hers are the letters she gave me and some of her poetry. 

i say all this in hopes someone might know of her, someone who knows of a woman who wrote poetry, who loved coffee, who would cry rivers of tears, who had an amazing personality, and who was a good friend.  i miss her and I hate that she is not with me anymore. I'm mad she would do this to me and not let me help her talk her out of things and get her help no matter what.  so please if anyone knows her ,tell me her last name so I can include her work in my poetry book. she was making one herself and now won't be able to. so to honor her I want to write a book and pay homage to her and our friendship.

1hq57or,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hq57or/my_uncle_who_hates_me_gave_me_inheritance/,My uncle who hates me gave me inheritance.,"I’m not sure how to start this so I’ll just start with some backstory. My name is James, I have a fairly decent relationship with everyone in my family, except for my uncle. My uncle pretty much hated me from birth. My mom told me that on my first birthday he apparently joked about getting bored of me and to get rid of me as a one year celebration. As a kid I tried to always get on his good side but as I got older I just gave up and decided it was better off to accept that he’s naturally an asshole.

Anyway, about a week ago my uncle has passed away due to suicide, it’s also worth mentioning that for close to a year before this event, he had pretty much cut contact with everyone he knew. Nobody knew if he was struggling with his mental health so it came as a shock to everyone, except me, I didn’t really care. Fast forward a few days later, My uncles lawyer comes to the house and in short basically tells me my uncle left me his house for inheritance. I was surprised when his lawyer told me this, to the point where I actually asked if he had the right person. My uncle didn’t leave a single person anything, not family, friends or anyone at all, but of all people he gave ME his house? I was still living with my mom at the time since I had just come out of a college dorm and was looking for a place so I wasn’t gonna complain about free housing. My uncles house is actually a good house so even more reason to accept.

So after I had been living in the house for 3 days i started to settle in fully. But yesterday I had woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of a light knocking sound from my bedroom floor. Below my room is a basement so obviously my first thought was to check there. I go to the basement, nothing wrong, I go back to the bedroom and the tapping has stopped. I was tired so I shrugged it off and went back to sleep. In the morning, I walked out of my room and was going to make myself a coffee, like I usually would most mornings. To get to my kitchen I have to walk past the basement door, so that’s what I did. But as I’m walking past, I notice the door is fully open, like handle against the wall kind of open. I swear I had closed it, granted I was half asleep but there was no way in hell I’d leave a door leading to a creepy basement wide open. I closed the door and went to make my coffee. 

It’s been a few hours since then and I had just got home from getting some groceries. First thing I notice when walking through the front door is the sound of a metal clanking sound…guess where it’s coming from. The fucking basement. I place the bag of groceries on the kitchen counter and walk to the basement, door is open, I walk down and follow the sound. I end up turning a corner that leads to some pipes and a dead end but as soon as I turned the corner, the sound had stopped. But I noticed something else. There was red writing on the wall that said “help us”. I had never noticed this writing before since I hadn’t lived here long enough to see the whole basement, only reason I’ve had to go down there is just to check out the knocking sound and this metal clinking sound. After that I just had a weird feeling, like I was being stalked kind of feeling, so I just wanted to get out of the basement. As I was walking to the door of the basement, the door just slammed shut, like full on slammed right in front of me. I didn’t know what to do, I just stood there for a moment, frozen in place. Eventually I got over the shock and just quickly made my way out of the basement.

Back to present time of writing this. I have just been watching a video on YouTube, one of those scary ones, this one in particular was talking about cults and demonic stuff. Eventually in the video my town was mentioned and apparently there’s some kind of urban legend of a group of people who supposedly participated in demonic rituals and some really weird/creepy shit, and then out of nowhere would either disappear or commit suicide. It’s currently 2:43 am as I’m writing this so I’ve had a full day going on before writing this, and all day I’ve noticed sounds, objects being misplaced and doors opening or closing. I’m not saying my uncle was involved in some shady shit but I’m also not putting it past the guy. My theory is the old bastard had cursed this home maybe? I really don’t know what to do, I don’t know much about this stuff so anyone who could either give advice or help me understand it would really help, I’ll keep updates on anything that happens.",12,1735614367.0,nosleep,2,0.93,False

Should I do it?,"Let me preface this by saying i’m F, almost 17 and my father has acted this way almost my entire life. Recently, he crossed a line and continues to cross them. I’m unsure if I am taking this too far but people in my life are telling me it’s bad and i need to do this. 

My dad has been overbearing my entire life, he has anger issues yet denies he has them. He has screamed at my younger brother (11), myself and my mother to the point of panic attacks on multiple occasions through the years. He has locked my mother in a car, causing her a panic attack because he wanted to have “a conversation” with her. His conversations involve him telling you his opinion, and not leaving you alone until you agree with him. He rants in your face and gets very upset when you do not agree with him. Until now, nothing has ever been physical and I do believe it was a temporary lack of judgement but that doesn’t make it okay. 
I have been gathering voice memos of him yelling at people in my household for the last four months. His arguments are very childish and I believe he has something going on with his brain because he is SO bipolar.

He’s very “I’m your dad you need to respect me”. 
I’ll detail the turning point now, Two weeks ago now I had just gotten home from school, he told me he was making dinner for 5:30-6:00ish and i said okay. It was 4:40pm and i hadn’t eaten all day so i went into the kitchen and made a piece of toast. He turns around and gets very upset at me because “now i wouldn’t eat my supper”, I told him I had hardly eaten all day and was hungry. He was upset and said i just made toast to defy his authority. He said I didn’t respect him, and I said “do you give me a reason to?” he got very upset and asked what i meant, I said he treated everyone in this household like crap and I was done with it. He dropped it for a minute, visibly angry but went and did some dishes. I buttered my toast and took it to my room. 
He proceeds to storm in, asks me to apologize to him, I refuse because why should I when I’m just calling him out on his behaviour, he takes my phone, and then takes my toast. He gets mad and stalks off to go smoke.

Dinner happens, I eat all my supper wow. 
11pm now, i go in and ask him for my phone in the morning for school, telling him i don’t need it now but i do need it for that. He refuses, I tell him I am unsafe at school and need it. He gets upset and starts yelling, asking me to apologize about making the toast and apologize about what I said to him. I refuse again, and go downstairs to text my mother (who is away on business) on my grandmothers phone who lives in our basement. I detail the situation, and ask if she can confirm I can have my phone tmr morning. I stay with my grandmother for two hours because she thought he’d blow up at me again.

The next morning, I awake to screaming threats of him cutting my phone bill and turning off the electricity to my room because “I don’t deserve it”. He wakes me up at 6:20am and proceeds to walk in my room, go to the garage where the breaker panel is and for the next 30ish minutes turned one breaker off, comes to my room to see if power is off, slams the door, repeat. all while screaming at me. He finally turns the power off for the whole floor. 
He told me I wasn’t going to school until I apologized and we figured this out. I told him he was being very aggressive and i didn’t appreciate it, and that it wasn’t just something you get over. He yells and screams and we go back and forth however many times, him still insisting on me apologizing on toast. he is yelling at me to the point I am mid panic attack having to deal with and respond to him. I said something again about not respecting him and not liking the way he treats my mother, I asked him “hasn’t she asked you for a divorce multiple times? why are you still here we all clearly don’t want you here”, he freaks out and gives me my phone back, it’s about 7:30 at this point. 

I grab it and don’t let go, he grabs for my phone, i turn and he grabs my arm and is fighting me for my phone for a solid 30 seconds. 4 of my press on nails came off in the process as well as me knocking over a candle that almost lit my room on fire. 
i gather my stuff up, him still yelling at me, i tell him i’m not doing this right now and I would be leaving and walking to my friends house up the road. He proceeds to stand in my doorway and not leave despite me telling him to get out and let me leave, I even threatened to jump out the window. He finally gets distracted by my grandmother coming upstairs and leaves, giving me an opportunity to get out of my room. I get my stuff together, he is telling me i’m not going to school and i’m not going to work and he would call my boss personally and tell them i couldn’t come in (he has threatened and done this in the past with a different job). I told him no, I would be going to both school and work and if he tried to pick me up I wouldn’t get in his car.

I went to my friends house, after him accusing me of manipulating the whole situation and making him out to be the bad guy every time. 

I told my mom all that happened and she told me or he showed up to call the police. He did show up, but I had told my manager and she got me out early. I stayed the night at a friends and the day after my mom got home and we sat down and had a conversation with my dad about his behaviour and he had gone too far and it was time for a divorce. 
He seemed like he had no idea it was coming and tried to say he just wanted to fix it. When a pattern has been going on for almost 16 years like this, it is time to end it.

He is currently living in a room in my basement and is only supposed to enter through the garage door and use the coffee maker and microwave in his room to cook unless he has cleared it with us first. 
My father doesn’t contribute financially much, he is extremely unreliable in this department. My mother has had to pay his bills for him, he only pays the electric and gas bill and my mother pays the rest. He doesn’t make enough to afford rent where we’re located, so he is unable to move out (his words, not mine). He had texted my mom and told her hes not leaving the house until she has bought him out, for the record SHE PAYS THE MORTGAGE HE PAYS NOTHING. I’m not too sure how that whole situation works but what I do know is I need him out. I am considering reaching out to my guidance counsellor about getting cps involved because quite honestly this is affecting me so much. It’s not physical abuse and I know people have it so much worse out there but it’s not fair that I have to come home to this everyday. It’s like he has manic episodes or something I don’t know who he is anymore. When he leaves the house he is a different person, everyone loves him and he’s so friendly. I called him a narcissist and a manipulator and that’s all I see in him. But at the same time hes my dad and I have nothing to compare it to as this is my life. Am I overreacting?

He’s been sending me text messages too which are basically begging me to talk to him and hes sending me tiktok’s that are getting weird. 

my mom is scared of putting her foot down so me doing this is the only way he will be leaving. I’m scared that CPS won’t help me fast enough because I’m almost 17. 

I know I’ve left a lot of details out, so feel free to ask any clarifying questions. Would CPS help? Is it severe enough they’d even help? How should I go about this? Should I do it? ",1,1735614360.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

1hq54am,https://www.reddit.com/r/bugbounty/comments/1hq54am/worst_security_of_wolt_and_doordash/,worst security of wolt and doordash,"Dear Wolt and DoorDash,

Do you even *know* what cybersecurity is? Because judging by the vulnerabilities currently moonwalking on the dark web, your approach to security is about as effective as a wet paper umbrella in a monsoon. I thought I'd be the better person and let you know, but then I realized: Why waste my breath on a company that treats cybersecurity like an optional topping on a budget pizza?

Let’s face it, reporting vulnerabilities to you is like explaining rocket science to a goldfish. You’re underqualified, overconfident, and a certified disaster waiting to happen.

**Your Infrastructure:** If Insecurity Were an Olympic Sport, You’d Take Gold.

I’ve seen toddlers build sturdier sandcastles. Your infrastructure isn’t just bad—it’s a dystopian hellscape of spaghetti code, duct-taped solutions, and negligence so profound it’s practically an art form. Your engineers must have a motto like, “If it ain’t broke, break it worse.”

**Your Security Engineers:** A Tragic Comedy in Human Form.

I reached out on LinkedIn—Wolt and DoorDash, both of you—and shocker, no one responded. Not that I expected much. Your “engineers” probably think LinkedIn is a dating app or a place to post memes about “the grindset.” Honestly, calling them engineers is an insult to real engineers everywhere. These people couldn’t secure a doghouse, let alone a tech platform.

* Your security team thinks a DDoS attack is a fancy coffee order.
* Penetration testing? Oh, they’re familiar—with the kind they pay for on weekends.
* If cybersecurity were a race, your team would be running backward, blindfolded, and barefoot.

It’s clear they’ve replaced actual skills with Reddit threads, conspiracy theories, and YouTube tutorials from preteens. You’ve essentially hired the tech-world equivalent of middle schoolers playing pretend.

**Your Priorities:** Somewhere Between ""Dumpster Diving"" and ""Utter Chaos.""

Let’s talk about your budget. You’re rolling in revenue but can’t spare a dime for actual cybersecurity? That’s like driving a Ferrari with duct-taped windows and no brakes. It’s reckless, idiotic, and screams, “We don’t care!” You’ve turned your platform into a playground for hackers, and when the inevitable happens, don’t pretend you weren’t warned.

Oh, and GDPR? Yeah, that’s coming for you too. Your users’ data is leaking faster than your engineers’ credibility, and when the authorities take a look, it’ll be game over.

**Pro Tips for Your Clown Show:**

1. Fire your current “engineers”—every single one. They’re not solving problems; they *are* the problem.
2. Hire a team that knows cybersecurity isn’t just a buzzword.
3. Stop letting your app be the training ground for script kiddies.

Your current security team is so unqualified they’d probably lose a chess match to a Roomba. If their job was to protect a lunchbox, they’d manage to leak its contents onto the dark web. You’re not running a tech company—you’re running a live demonstration of what *not* to do in cybersecurity.

So here’s my final piece of advice: Clean house. Fire the clowns. Burn the circus tent to the ground. Then, and only then, might you have a chance of building something that doesn’t collapse under the weight of its own incompetence.

You’re not just a ticking time bomb—you’re a fireworks display of failure waiting to be exploited.

Let’s have a little chat about something that’s been bugging me: referring to Portland as “PDX”.

Let me be perfectly clear—PDX is the airport code. That’s it. It’s not the city, it’s not the vibe, and it’s definitely not your personality.

Every time I see someone post, “Best tacos in PDX?” or “Looking for a dentist in PDX,” I can’t help but picture them wandering Concourse C, looking for a taco truck next to the Hudson News. Are you asking about Portland, the city, or did your layover just take a weird turn?

Here’s the thing:

Calling Portland PDX screams two things:
	
1.	Wannabe worldliness. Using airport codes casually doesn’t make you cosmopolitan. It makes you sound like someone who just discovered TSA PreCheck and now thinks they’re a jet-setting influencer.
	
2.	Corporate branding brain rot. Reducing an entire city to its airport code feels like the linguistic equivalent of slapping a “Keep Portland Weird” sticker on your Prius. Portland is a city with culture, history, and character—none of which live in a baggage claim carousel.

Here’s my ask:

If you love Portland, just call it Portland. 

Heck, call it Rose City, Stumptown, or Bridgetown if you’re feeling nostalgic. Just leave PDX where it belongs—on flight itineraries and baggage tags.

Discuss—or don’t. I’ll be over here sipping coffee in *PORTLAND* and wondering why so many people are eager to rebrand the whole city as an airport.

I need assistance figuring out the best finance ‘order of operations.’ I want every dollar after bills are paid to be allocated towards paying down debt, retirement, and general savings. 

Monthly Revenue = $4,329 + commission

Monthly Expenses = ~$2,000 including rent, utilities, car payment, car insurance, gas, groceries, subscriptions, phone payment

Monthly Net Income = $2,329 plus commission
**Note on my commission: it varies widely but always guaranteed. For example, my lowest month this year was $50 and my highest month was $5,000. How should I allocate this variable expense? 

Debt
Car loan: $11,951.26 outstanding balance @ 5.79% APR ($429 monthly payment)

Student loans: $26,606.64 (currently in forbearance until May 2025; interest rate range 3.76-5.05%) *I hesitate paying anything more than the minimum payment on student loans because I am holding out hope for loan forgiveness LOL. I haven’t paid towards this since they went into forbearance earlier this year)

Savings
~$17,000 in my credit union’s savings account plus some a couple gold bullion bars (left from family member’s passing)

Emergency Fund
Should I go ahead and use my savings to fully fund my emergency fund, or should I partially fund it with 1 month of expenses and contribute a little to it every paycheck? Should I keep my emergency fund in my credit union’s savings account, or use a tool that will grow my money at a better rate (i.e. HYSA, CD ladder, MMF, short term treasuries, etc.)?

401k 
I am already contributing the amount of my company’s 4% match.

Roth IRA
Just opened with fidelity and put in $300. I can still max out for the 2024 year by putting in $6,700. Should I use my savings to max it out? If not, what amount or percentage should I contribute each paycheck moving forward?

HSA
Should I start maxing this out too? I currently do not contribute to this but will start for the 2025 year which would be ~$170 every paycheck. 

Individual brokerage account for personal investing
I’m not sure if it’s wise to open one if I have outstanding debt?

Travel fund 
My partner and I take at least one or two trips a year. Should I also use a HYSA, CD ladder, MMF, short term treasuries to fund this? 

Fun Money
I will absolutely need to have money set aside to pay for wants like clothes, makeup/beauty, nails done, the occasional coffee from a coffee shop, etc. Should I save based on a percentage of every paycheck or a certain dollars amount. Maybe this is where I can use my commission to fund?

“The halls of Chesmore have been quiet for some years now. Dust and cobs webs filled the rooms like a ghostly image of past dreams or nightmares. White sheets still bright but dusty from being unused. It was once a grand mansion that the rich and famous frequent for parties and weddings. Young girl walk down the grand banisters in coronation parties. To announce their arrival into sociality. Beautiful gowns and dashing men. It was all glitz and glamour. The smell of meats and sweet flowery perfume haunted the Grand ball room. But now it was a damp smell of old rotting wood and death. Death that no one in the town had any answers to. Death that plague this home for ages. It was the silence though that made it more haunting. With its slight of sounds that seem to come from odd places. The sounds of feet running or walking. The whispers of a sweet women and the howling of a shattered heart. Yes Chesmore is a fine place to visit if you are looking for an escape from the normal life.”

Evra finish the reading the last sentence and put her mug down almost missing the glass table completely. 
“son of a bitch” Evra quickly grab a napkin and began to wipe the spot of coffee that feel out of the mug before she was able to catch it. 

It was a bright morning and once again she had stayed awake for 24 hrs. The coffee wasn’t a big help either, neither where the sleeping pill. She lived in her own world. Always alone, traveling to places she never to before. When she had her nervous breakdown she realize that no one was truly there for her. But she manage to take care of stuff on her own. 

She glance back at the ad in the paper again. “Chesmore” It sounded like a nice place to see and tour. She didn’t much like scary things. But this was one place she probably make an exception for.

I was nervous about it at first when I'm very first tried it because my allergist recommended doing two doses twice a day which was way too much for my first time but now that I'm going to use the side effects I might do a standard dose of twice a day in some form. 

For anyone that's a bit nervous about it due to the side effects or the black box warning I recommend trying at least once because the feeling of being able to run for blocks with only your physical body being exhausted and your lungs literally being prevented from squeezing up like a vice is amazing. Being able to talk without having an asthma attack after that is so fucking nice. 

Maintenance medications especially LABAs essentially gave me my llife back. I'm going to tell my allergist / pulmonologist and my PCP to officially make it part of my medications list and phase me off of my previous medication arnuity Ellipta. 

Arnuity worked but the problem was that it didn't stop me from having an asthma attack later on. It just reduced the incidence of it. But the advair completely stopped any asthma attacks from happening at all.

So I booked an international flight that was supposed to fly out of Chicago on a Monday night. The Saturday night before my flight, I went to my airline booking app to enter my passport info. I took a picture of my passport and an error message showed up. I assumed the pic was blurry and I just had to retake it, but instead it said my passport was expired. I was shocked. I had spent time and money planning and preparing for this trip I was so excited about only for me to be told it would not be possible (at least at that time). 

To those who shame others for booking international flights without confirming your passport information first, you’re completely right! It was a huge mistake that I will never make again. I had been flying with this passport for 10 years and had not run into this issue before so my passport expiring was not at the forefront of my mind. On top of that, my airline did not ask me for my passport info before booking. But none of that matters to TSA. 

Here’s how I was able to get a same day passport at Chicago Passport Agency:

First, I went here: https://passportappointment.travel.state.gov to book an appointment. They ask for your date of travel and your zip code and present you with a list of nearest passport agencies. Mine was Chicago Passport Agency. The problem was there were no online appointments available. It said to wait and call this number: (877) 487-2778. When I called late Saturday night, it was after hours and I had to wait to call until the next morning. I followed the advice of others on here to have my phone ready at 8:59am CT that Sunday (opens at 10am ET on the weekend). As soon as it was 9:00am, I pressed call and then dialed 1-1-2. Miraculously someone answered and I explained my situation. They were able to get me an appointment at 8:30am that Monday (the day of my flight). They sent me a confirmation email for my appointment along with a DS-2 passport application form to fill out. 

Here are the documents you need for your appointment (*if you still have your passport and it’s just expired - there other instructions online for if you lost your passport/it was stolen*):
- Printed copy of appointment confirmation email 
- Printed copy of filled out DS-82 passport application form 
- Printed proof of international travel confirmation email for flight 
- Passport photo (I followed the advice of others and go to a place like CVS to get it done - I wasn’t taking risks)
- Old passport 
- Be prepared to pay for the urgent new passport renewal fee (my total cost was $190) 
- Things I brought just in case: ID, copy of birth certificate 

The day of the appointment: Chicago Passport Agency opens at 8:00am. I had read posts and comments on here about a line forming early so I got there at 7:00am. No one was there and security wouldn’t let people in the building until 7:45am so I went to a nearby coffee shop. I came back around 7:25am and there were already people there. Eventually a security guard ushered people into lines, with the passport line being at the very left. Luckily I was towards the front of the line because of the time I got there. By the time it was 7:45am, a line had formed around the block. I waited, walked in through security, and got to the 9th floor. There, they have a check-in where you provide them with your papers and then they give you a ticket and later call your number. Because I was at the front of the line, they called my number almost instantly after checking in. They completed the rest of my paperwork and told me to come back between 2-4pm. I was out of my appointment by 8:15am (15 minutes earlier than my originally scheduled time!). 

I came back at 2:25pm and there was no line. I got through security, came to the check in on the 9th floor again, signed a receipt, and they gave me my new passport (and my old one back too).

1hq4vxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartkitchengadgetser/comments/1hq4vxw/smart_keurig_coffee_makers_the_ultimate_guide_to/,Smart Keurig Coffee Makers: The Ultimate Guide to Connected Coffee,"[Fresh and Trendy – Discover the Hottest New Products!](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=keurig coffee maker smart&s=date-desc-rank&tag=smartymode-20)

In the world of caffeinated convenience, smart coffee makers have revolutionized the morning routine (and beyond!).  This guide dives deep into the realm of smart Keurig coffee makers, exploring their features, benefits, and potential drawbacks to help you decide if a connected coffee experience is right for you.  We'll cover everything from app-controlled brewing to troubleshooting connectivity issues, ensuring you're equipped to make an informed purchase.

## Key Features of Smart Keurig Coffee Makers

Smart Keurig models offer a range of features designed to elevate your coffee experience beyond the simple push of a button.  Here are some key highlights:

* **Automated Brewing and Scheduling:** Wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee thanks to pre-programmed brewing times.  Schedule your coffee for weekdays, weekends, or even specific times throughout the day. This is a game-changer for busy mornings or those who simply prefer a consistent coffee ritual.

* **Remote Control via Smartphone Apps:**  The Keurig app puts you in control, even when you're not in the kitchen.  Start brewing from your bedroom, office, or even when you're on your commute home.  This level of convenience is a significant selling point for many smart coffee maker owners.

* **Customizable Brew Settings:**  Beyond simply brewing a cup, Smart Keurig machines allow you to fine-tune your coffee to perfection.  Adjust the strength, temperature, and cup size to match your preferences and the specific K-Cup you're using.

* **Integration with Voice Assistants:**  Compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, these smart coffee makers respond to voice commands, allowing for hands-free brewing. Simply ask your smart assistant to brew a cup, and watch the magic happen.  (Note: We'll later discuss the practicality of this feature.)

* **Compatibility with Various K-Cup Pod Brands:** While Keurig K-Cups are optimized for the best results, many smart models support a wide range of brands, giving you flexibility in your coffee choices.  However, keep in mind that custom brew settings might not be as effective with non-Keurig pods.

* **Advanced Water Reservoirs:** Larger water reservoirs mean fewer refills, perfect for households that consume a significant amount of coffee throughout the day.  This reduces the frequency of interruptions during your busy morning routine.


## Understanding Brew ID Technology

A standout feature of many Smart Keurig models is Brew ID technology. This innovative system scans the barcode on your Keurig K-Cup pod and automatically adjusts the brew settings based on the specific blend's profile.  This means that each cup is brewed to the roaster's recommended settings, ensuring optimal flavor extraction and a consistently delicious cup of coffee.  This is a significant improvement over traditional Keurig machines, where you might need to manually adjust settings for different K-Cups.


## Customization Options: Mastering Your Perfect Cup

Smart Keurig coffee makers excel in customization.  The app allows you to save your preferred settings for different K-Cups or personal preferences.  Experiment with:

* **Strength:** Adjust the intensity of your coffee from mild to bold.
* **Temperature:**  Fine-tune the temperature for optimal flavor extraction and your preferred drinking temperature.
* **Cup Size:**  Brew a single cup, a travel mug size, or even a larger carafe, depending on your needs.


## App Control and Scheduling: The Convenience Factor

The Keurig app is more than just a remote control; it's your central hub for managing your coffee experience.  Key features include:

* **Brew Scheduling:**  Set your coffee to brew automatically at a specific time each day, ensuring a freshly brewed cup awaits you when you wake up or arrive home.

* **Remote Brewing:**  Start your brew from anywhere with an internet connection. Perfect for those chilly winter mornings when you don't want to leave the warmth of your bed.

* **Brew History:**  Track your brewing habits to understand your coffee consumption patterns and adjust your settings as needed.


## Voice Assistant Integration: Practicality vs. Novelty?

While voice control sounds futuristic and convenient, the practicality can be a mixed bag.  While initiating a brew with a simple voice command is undeniably cool, the user experience can sometimes feel less intuitive than using the app.  Many users find that the added step of stating a specific wake word (""""Hey Google,"""" """"Alexa"""") before each command can be cumbersome, especially in a busy morning.  This is a factor to consider when evaluating the overall value of this feature.


## Integration with K-Cup Pods: Brand Compatibility

Smart Keurig models generally support various K-Cup pod brands. However, for optimal results and to take full advantage of the Brew ID technology, using genuine Keurig K-Cups is highly recommended.  While third-party K-Cups will still brew coffee, you may not be able to utilize the customized brew settings as effectively.


## Maintenance and Troubleshooting: Keeping Your Smart Keurig Running Smoothly

Regular maintenance is crucial for extending the lifespan of your Smart Keurig and ensuring optimal performance.  Key aspects include:

* **Descaling:**  Regular descaling removes mineral buildup that can impact brewing performance and potentially damage the machine. The frequency of descaling depends on your water hardness; consult your machine's manual for specific recommendations.

* **Cleaning:**  Regular cleaning of the water reservoir, K-Cup holder, and other components will prevent the build-up of coffee residue and maintain hygiene.

* **Connectivity Issues:**  If you experience Wi-Fi connectivity problems, ensure your router is strong enough and that your coffee maker is within range.  Check your router settings and the Keurig app for troubleshooting tips if needed. Consult your user manual or the Keurig website for more detailed instructions.


## Customer Reviews and Case Studies: Real-World Experiences

Consumer reviews offer valuable insights into the real-world performance of smart Keurig coffee makers.  While many praise the convenience and customization options, some users have reported:

* **Connectivity Issues:**  Intermittent Wi-Fi connectivity has been a recurring complaint for some users, highlighting the importance of a strong and stable home Wi-Fi network.

* **Durability Concerns:**  Some reviews mention durability issues, particularly with the internal components.  It's crucial to research specific model reviews before purchasing to assess their long-term reliability.

* **Practicality of Smart Features:**  The practicality of voice control and app integration varies depending on individual preferences and tech proficiency.


## Best Keurig Smart Models: A Comparison

Choosing the right Smart Keurig model depends on your specific needs and budget.  Consider factors such as water reservoir size, brewing speed, and the included smart features.  Researching reviews for specific models (like the K-Supreme Plus SMART and K-Cafe Smart) will help you make an informed decision.  Compare features, price points, and user reviews to find the perfect fit for your home.


## Conclusion: Is a Smart Keurig Right for You?

Smart Keurig coffee makers offer a significant upgrade to the traditional coffee brewing experience.  The convenience of automated brewing, remote control, and customizable settings is undeniable. However, potential connectivity issues and the practicality of the smart features should be carefully considered.  By weighing the pros and cons and researching specific models, you can determine if a smart Keurig coffee maker aligns with your needs and budget, bringing a new level of convenience and customization to your daily coffee ritual.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Do I need a strong Wi-Fi signal for the smart features to work?**

A: Yes, a strong and stable Wi-Fi signal is essential for optimal performance of the smart features.  Weak signals can lead to connectivity issues and prevent remote brewing or app control.

**Q: Can I use any K-Cup pods with my Smart Keurig?**

A: While many Smart Keurig models are compatible with various K-Cup brands, using genuine Keurig K-Cups will yield the best results and allow you to fully utilize the Brew ID technology for customized brewing.

**Q: How often do I need to descale my Smart Keurig?**

A: The descaling frequency depends on your water hardness.  Consult your owner's manual for specific recommendations, but generally, descaling every few months is a good practice.  Your machine will often have an indicator light to alert you when descaling is needed.

**Q: What if my Smart Keurig stops connecting to Wi-Fi?**

A: Try the following troubleshooting steps: check your router's signal strength, restart your coffee maker and router, and ensure your coffee maker is within range of your Wi-Fi network.  Consult the Keurig app or website for more detailed troubleshooting instructions.

1hq4u3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1hq4u3x/sooo_interesting/,Sooo Interesting! ,"I went into clean eating which is sugar free but also it is entertainment free. 

I am tired of trying to figure out what could “treat me”, what next “reward” should be, how I can console myself with food after stressful day, and generally I am tired of ever-present wonder “what is now? Coffee? Tea? Nuts? Coffee and cheese? How much cheese? Can I have nuts? What is in the fridge?” I am tired of it. 

So I went into being fed twice a day. Lunch and early dinner. Lunch is eggs. Dinner is protein (fish, meat), cooked or uncooked vegetables, feta cheese. Sometimes if I think I need more calories, I drink kefir after dinner with the ground flaxseed. I do not salt my food, do not try make it tastier. 

People might think I am miserable. I thought I will be. But I was SO tired of constant food noise in my head, pesky pounds around my waist, and I wanted to see can I live spiritually without being a food slave. 

I am shocked, guys! While I did experience discomfort here and there, mostly in the evenings, it was relatively easy to overcome. I just remind myself my intent. No food after 6pm. And then I busy myself with what needs to be done or what I want to do. I finished long knitting project in a flash and actually loved it! Again, I was knitting as if I was young - with all my concentration and fully loosing myself in the craft. I forgot how nice it feels! 

I am discovering my patience is coming back. With each day I have more and more ability to focus on things at hand without jumping mind when my attention hardly holds for longer than a few seconds on one thing! This focus is so refreshing! 

I am forgetting about food! My cravings are leaving. My decision is resolute - no entertainment with food. I ate my fish, ate my veggies, it was served with oil and feta. It was enough. No more meals. And since I know it, I do not think about it. I might choose to prepare myself hot bath. Facial mask. Drink cold water while in a hot bath. This is enough for sensual pleasure. 

I am sleeping, guys! Sleep was always my big issue. When I used to diet or fast I could not fall asleep for hours. Now I fall asleep within a few minutes. Like right away. I sleep through the night! I wake up refreshed! Absence of stimulants in my menu brings calmness that I had not experienced ever. 

It really feels almost blessed. As if I finally found my place, my monastery, my tribe. No gluttony, just very simple and bland meals. 

Another thing: when I eat my two boiled eggs at lunch, or start eating my unsalted boiled fish with steamed cabbage at dinner, a strong feeling of gratitude to my food swells in my chest. I silently say “thank you for this meal”. It reminds me of a prayer before eating, only it comes to me naturally now. 

I use Apple Watch for sleep tracking. Since I embarked on bland time restricted and sugar free eating, my numbers are superb. My heart rate slows down, my respiratory rate slows down. And before that I was stressed in my sleep. I am finally resting! 

And as if this is not enough, there is another fantastic feeling - feeling of abundance! How come it can be born out of so much restriction? When I was on eating spree, I always lacked something, being on a roller coaster of sugar.  Now there is finally feeling of sane satiety. And once satiated I am grateful for abundance of food.

ANY help?,"On March 6th, 2024, I visited a chiropractor for chronic neck and shoulder pain. During the session, he aggressively pressed down on my head while I was seated, performing a neck-compression test. To be clear, he had both his hands over the top of my head, as I was in a seated position, and pushed in forcefully and suddenly.

Since then, I’ve experienced ongoing extreme discomfort, including lightheadedness, faintness, paresthesia in my left ring and pinky fingers, head pressure, dizziness, and fatigue. The first couple months were so severe I had multiple ER visits and innumerable doctor's visits Ten months later, my symptoms persist, though less intense. I still experience lightness, tingling in my left fingers and head, head discomfort and heaviness, and episodes of overwhelming unsteadiness, which I call “waves” or “rushes,” that I have to wait out.

I’ve had extensive tests—Cervical MRI, Brain MRI, CT scans, blood work, and heart tests—all showing nothing abnormal. Despite seeing multiple doctors, no one has a clear explanation. My daily life has been significantly impacted, and I can no longer exercise, drink coffee, and, many other things.

I'm sorry this is so long. Any suggestions on how to improve would be immensely appreciated, as this has been a difficult struggle for the past 10 months.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you, and God bless.",2,1735612954.0,cervical_instability,1,1.0,False

So I had woken up on my side facing my room and couldn't room. I felt like my dog was on my back and I could feel its knees digging into my back. But I could talk to myself, but not as easy, I tried to speak saying ""help"" because i thought it was someonewaking me up for some reason. Then the room turns blue, or an opaque hue of blue everywhere and I saw a face? Or a translucent face in front of me, and it said something but I can't remember it, but I understood it. Then I woke up and launched my arm into the air and made a ""guh"" sound or something. But I could still feel my dog on my back. 

So I turn around and nothing was there and the feeling left. But I was on full alert mode when I woke up like as if I had a coffee and I have fully woken up. Then I passed out and fell asleep. Got woken up and saw my mum downstairs and asked if im ok because she heard screaming?

Any Help?,"On March 6th, 2024, I visited a chiropractor for chronic neck and shoulder pain. During the session, he aggressively pressed down on my head while I was seated, performing a neck-compression test. To be clear, he had both his hands over the top of my head, as I was in a seated position, and pushed in forcefully and suddenly. 

Since then, I’ve experienced ongoing extreme discomfort, including lightheadedness, faintness, paresthesia in my left ring and pinky fingers, head pressure, dizziness, and fatigue. The first couple months were so severe I had multiple ER visits and innumerable doctor's visits Ten months later, my symptoms persist, though less intense. I still experience lightness, tingling in my left fingers and head, head discomfort and heaviness, and episodes of overwhelming unsteadiness, which I call “waves” or “rushes,” that I have to wait out.

I’ve had extensive tests—Cervical MRI, Brain MRI, CT scans, blood work, and heart tests—all showing nothing abnormal. Despite seeing multiple doctors, no one has a clear explanation. My daily life has been significantly impacted, and I can no longer exercise, drink coffee, and, many other things. 

I'm sorry this is so long.  Any suggestions on how to improve would be immensely appreciated, as this has been a difficult struggle for the past 10 months. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you, and God bless.",1,1735612651.0,Cervicalinstability,1,1.0,False

Even if no one has any advice I appreciate this space to get my thoughts together and jotted down. I need to likely get  pro help and the first step for me is trying to accurately explain whats going on. 

I have been on Vyvanse for a few years and Paxil for 18 years. I am a 34 year old male for context. Recently laid off but was working remote prior so all of these were problems before. I def feel worse that I am unemployed but I would be lying if I said these only started recently.  

  
1. **Constantly chasing dopamine.** I get up earlier than needed, often a tired still, just to drink coffee while I wait for Vyvanse to kick in. I then spend the whole morning and early afternoon on the internet, social media etc. Way too many of these days I end up looking at porn and masturbating. I am married and besides the fact its a bad habit, it has ruined my sex life and I feel like a terrible husband. 

I usually try to do something else for an hour after lunch but that is basically just to kill time between Vyvanse starting to wear down and having my 2nd/3rd cups off coffee. At which point  I scroll the internet, read articles, fantasy sports, social media  again. 

Come early evening once the the afternoon caffeine has worn off, I start feeling depressed and basically binge eat for dinner. Many a nights ordering a milk shake or something from Uber Eats for dessert.  I have ballooned up to 250 pounds. 

  
2. My whole life I have struggled to brush my teeth as well as do consistent habits due to executive function issues.  I know what I need to do but cant get myself to do it.  Put my clothes in a hamper? Why bother I will never do consistently. I know its bad to think that way but thats how my brain works. 

I hate what my life has become.  All I do is just USE the internet/social media, read books and watch TV.  

My day consists of morning caffeine-Vyvanse dopamine- craving my afternoon caffeine- binge eating for dinner. Its so unhealthy and  unproductive and I am going nowhere living like this. Every day is the same, and if a certain day is not the same, it would only be for a negative reason  never anything positive. 

I just have ZERO discipline to make changes. Deleting apps and stuff doesn't work for me.  No willpower and I am in a really a bad spot. I dont even really know where to begin to make changes. I

The display has the 2 doses (1 cup or 2) and they both seem like you can customize the number, but this number seems to be seconds of grinding rather than grams of coffee. For example at the right size grind I need and just under 18 grams of coffee it’s at around 8 on the screen (8 seconds of grinding). How can I get this number to display the coffee weight in grams instead of number of seconds of grinding? 

Is that possible or am I going to have to weigh beans and do the math every single time? I’d rather just leave some beans in the hopper and grind as needed as I tend to go through them relatively quickly anyway so they don’t get stale. ",1,1735612425.0,EurekaOroMignonSD,0,1.0,False

","In today’s interconnected world, where we rely heavily on the internet for work, communication, and entertainment, protecting our online privacy and security has never been more important. From hackers targeting public Wi-Fi networks to governments and companies tracking your online activity, threats to personal privacy are everywhere. This is where VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)In today’s interconnected world, where we rely heavily on the internet for work, communication, and entertainment, protecting our online privacy and security has never been more important. From hackers targeting public Wi-Fi networks to governments and companies tracking your online activity, threats to personal privacy are everywhere. This is where VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) come into play. VPNs are powerful tools designed to protect your privacy and secure your online activity. In this post, we’ll explain how VPNs work and the key ways they help safeguard your personal information and enhance your online security.

1. What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that creates an encrypted, secure connection between your device and the internet. It routes your internet traffic through a remote server, masking your real IP address and encrypting your data. This makes it harder for third parties, such as hackers, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or even government agencies, to monitor your online activities or steal your personal information.

2. Key Ways VPNs Protect Your Online Privacy and Security

2.1. Encrypting Your Internet Connection

The main function of a VPN is to encrypt your internet traffic, which ensures that no one can intercept and read your data. Whether you’re sending an email, making an online purchase, or accessing a website, a VPN scrambles your data so that even if it’s intercepted, it remains unreadable.

How it works: VPNs use powerful encryption protocols, such as AES-256-bit encryption, to secure your data. This encryption is so strong that it is virtually impossible for hackers or any third parties to decipher the information.

Why it’s important: Encryption protects sensitive information, such as your login credentials, credit card details, and personal messages, ensuring that your data remains private and secure.

2.2. Hiding Your IP Address

When you connect to the internet without a VPN, your IP address (Internet Protocol address) is exposed. This unique identifier can reveal your geographic location, internet service provider, and potentially even your identity. Websites and online services use your IP address to track your activity, personalize content, and serve targeted ads.

How it works: A VPN masks your real IP address by assigning you an IP address from one of its own secure servers. This makes it appear as though you are browsing the internet from the server's location, not your actual physical location.

Why it’s important: Hiding your IP address protects your anonymity and privacy while browsing the web, preventing websites, advertisers, and malicious parties from tracking your movements or collecting personal information.

2.3. Protecting Your Data on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks (found in coffee shops, airports, hotels, etc.) are often unsecured, meaning hackers can easily intercept your data and launch man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. These attacks allow cybercriminals to read or manipulate your internet traffic, including login credentials and financial details.

How it works: A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, even on unsecured networks, ensuring that hackers can’t access your data while you’re using public Wi-Fi.

Why it’s important: By securing your connection, a VPN prevents hackers from stealing sensitive information, such as your passwords and credit card numbers, while you browse, shop, or work online.

2.4. Avoiding Tracking by ISPs and Advertisers

Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) can track your online activity, including the websites you visit, the content you view, and the services you use. This information can be sold to advertisers or shared with government agencies. Additionally, websites and advertisers use tracking technologies, like cookies and tracking pixels, to monitor your browsing habits and show targeted ads.

How it works: When you use a VPN, your traffic is encrypted and routed through a secure server, preventing your ISP from monitoring your activity. The VPN also blocks tracking scripts and cookies that websites and advertisers use to track your behavior.

Why it’s important: A VPN helps you maintain online anonymity, ensuring that your browsing history is not tracked or sold to third parties. This reduces unwanted targeted ads and prevents your personal data from being used for marketing purposes.

2.5. Bypassing Censorship and Geo-Restrictions

Many countries, companies, and even schools place restrictions on what you can access on the internet. For example, in some regions, popular social media sites like Facebook or Twitter are blocked, or certain streaming services may restrict access to content based on your geographic location (e.g., Netflix content varies by country).

How it works: A VPN allows you to connect to a server in a different country, bypassing geo-restrictions and censorship. This makes it appear as though you are browsing from the country where the content is available, allowing you to access blocked websites or streaming services.

Why it’s important: If you live in a country with strict internet censorship or travel to a country where certain websites are blocked, a VPN gives you the freedom to access the open internet without restrictions.

2.6. Preventing DDoS Attacks

A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is a type of cyberattack where the attacker floods a server or network with massive amounts of traffic, causing it to slow down or crash. This is often used in cyberbullying or online gaming scenarios, where a player or website is targeted with overwhelming traffic to disrupt their activities.

How it works: A VPN hides your real IP address and routes your traffic through a secure server, preventing attackers from identifying your device or network. This makes it difficult for cybercriminals to launch a successful DDoS attack against you.

Why it’s important: By protecting your real IP address, a VPN helps safeguard you from malicious attacks and ensures that your online presence remains secure.

3. Additional VPN Security Features to Consider

While encryption and IP masking are the core features of a VPN, many modern VPNs come with additional security features to enhance your protection:

3.1. Kill Switch

A kill switch automatically disconnects your device from the internet if the VPN connection drops unexpectedly, ensuring that your real IP address isn’t exposed.

3.2. DNS Leak Protection

DNS (Domain Name System) leaks can expose your real IP address even when using a VPN. DNS leak protection ensures that your DNS queries are routed through the VPN server, preventing any leaks.

3.3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Some VPNs offer multi-factor authentication (MFA), requiring an additional form of verification (such as a code sent to your phone) to access your account. This provides an extra layer of protection in case your VPN account is compromised.

3.4. Ad and Malware Blocking

Many VPNs offer built-in features that block ads, trackers, and malware from accessing your device. This helps enhance security by preventing harmful or intrusive content from reaching you.

4. Conclusion

A VPN is one of the most effective tools for protecting your online privacy and security. By encrypting your data, masking your IP address, and preventing tracking, VPNs give you greater control over your online activities. Whether you’re using public Wi-Fi, bypassing geo-restrictions, or safeguarding sensitive data, a VPN ensures that your information remains private and secure.

In an age where digital threats are becoming more sophisticated, a VPN is an essential tool for anyone who values privacy and security. Whether you're browsing, shopping online, or using public networks, a VPN provides peace of mind knowing your data is protected from prying eyes.

Need advice.","So I've always been petite and extremely confident with my body. I could eat basically anything and never gained weight but I never was a super unhealthy eater anyway. I always sat at around 100 to 115 lbs once I reached my max height. I gained a normal amount for my pregnancy and was just all belly. Now about a year and a half ago I blew up like a balloon and was at 178 I didn't even notice until I stopped fitting into my pants. My body type is pear shaped I've always had a larger behind and small chest. I've also always had that little lower belly fat layer with the rest of my belly being flat. So my pants kept fitting for a while since they were a bit bigger anyway. 
Recently I've gone back down a few sizes in pants and been asked if I've lost weight. So I'm guessing I have lost some weight and may not be 170lbs I will edit when I check my weight later at my aunts house since I don't have a scale. I was living a very sedentary lifestyle for a while so i think I've started losing weight because I've been moving more, and trying to eat less carbs and sugars. I still love to have coffee in the morning and I just can't bring myself to drink it black. 

My main questions are could being more sedentary really make me gain that much weight? In such a short time? I wasn't super active before that, I didn't excersise or anything I just was more social and did more rather than sitting in my house all day. I also hardly drank water then and now I drink so much more but I thought that was good for losing weight?

 How can I get my arms slimmer without them bulking up too much? I have some 5 lb dumbells that I am gonna start using to try and get rid of the chubbyness of my arms. Is that enough weight though?

Should I try zepbound along with the food and exercise changes? I've been walking a lot more and have a step counter trying to hit my 10k everyday. I don't eat fast food, and do eat Steak,or porkchops  about 5 times a week with a side of steamed broccoli 
And rice but am thinking of cutting out the rice or lowering the amount of it I eat. 

Any alternatives to coffee with cold foam and sugar? I really just can't drink it black I can't stand the taste but I definitely have a coffee addiction in the mornings.

Who doesn’t love a classic Italian dessert? 🇮🇹 Tiramisu is the perfect balance of creamy, coffee-soaked layers, with just the right amount of sweetness. It's so easy to make, and trust me, it’ll disappear faster than you can say “delicious”! 😋 Ready to impress your friends and family? Let’s dive in!

**Ingredients**:

6 large egg yolks 🥚  
¾ cup sugar 🍬  
1 cup mascarpone cheese 🧀  
1 ½ cups heavy cream 🍶  
2 cups brewed coffee (cooled) ☕  
2 tbsp coffee liqueur (optional) 🍸  
1 pack ladyfingers 🍪  
2 tbsp cocoa powder 🍫  
Dark chocolate shavings (optional for garnish) 🍫  
**Preparation Method:**

Make the custard: In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until pale and thick. Then, gently fold in the mascarpone cheese until smooth and creamy.  
Whip the cream: In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Fold it into the mascarpone mixture until everything is well combined.  
Prepare the coffee mixture: In a shallow dish, combine the brewed coffee and coffee liqueur (if using).  
Assemble the layers: Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture (don’t soak them too long, just a quick dip), then arrange them in the bottom of a 9x9-inch dish.  
Layer the cream: Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, smoothing it into an even layer. Repeat the process with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture.  
Chill: Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight if you can wait that long! 😆  
Serve: Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder and garnish with dark chocolate shavings for that extra touch of elegance. 🍫  
**Conclusion**:  
Tiramisu is one of those desserts that brings everyone together. It’s the perfect sweet finish to any meal, and believe me, your guests will be asking for seconds (or thirds!). 💕 Try it out, and let me know how yours turned out! Who’s ready to dig in? 🍴

Recently, he crossed a line and continues to cross them. I’m unsure if I am taking this too far but people in my life are telling me it’s bad and i need to do this. 
My dad has been overbearing my entire life, he has anger issues yet denies he has them. He has screamed at my younger brother (11), myself and my mother to the point of panic attacks on multiple occasions through the years. He has locked my mother in a car, causing her a panic attack because he wanted to have “a conversation” with her. His conversations involve him telling you his opinion, and not leaving you alone until you agree with him. He rants in your face and gets very upset when you do not agree with him. Until now, nothing has ever been physical and I do believe it was a temporary lack of judgement but that doesn’t make it okay. 
I have been gathering voice memos of him yelling at people in my household for the last four months. His arguments are very childish and I believe he has something going on with his brain because he is SO bipolar.
He’s very “I’m your dad you need to respect me”. 
I’ll detail the turning point now, Two weeks ago now I had just gotten home from school, he told me he was making dinner for 5:30-6:00ish and i said okay. It was 4:40pm and i hadn’t eaten all day so i went into the kitchen and made a piece of toast. He turns around and gets very upset at me because “now i wouldn’t eat my supper”, I told him I had hardly eaten all day and was hungry. He was upset and said i just made toast to defy his authority. He said I didn’t respect him, and I said “do you give me a reason to?” he got very upset and asked what i meant, I said he treated everyone in this household like crap and I was done with it. He dropped it for a minute, visibly angry but went and did some dishes. I buttered my toast and took it to my room. 
He proceeds to storm in, asks me to apologize to him, I refuse because why should I when I’m just calling him out on his behaviour, he takes my phone, and then takes my toast. He gets mad and stalks off to go smoke.
Dinner happens, I eat all my supper wow. 
11pm now, i go in and ask him for my phone in the morning for school, telling him i don’t need it now but i do need it for that. He refuses, I tell him I am unsafe at school and need it. He gets upset and starts yelling, asking me to apologize about making the toast and apologize about what I said to him. I refuse again, and go downstairs to text my mother (who is away on business) on my grandmothers phone who lives in our basement. I detail the situation, and ask if she can confirm I can have my phone tmr morning. I stay with my grandmother for two hours because she thought he’d blow up at me again.
The next morning, I awake to screaming threats of him cutting my phone bill and turning off the electricity to my room because “I don’t deserve it”. He wakes me up at 6:20am and proceeds to walk in my room, go to the garage where the breaker panel is and for the next 30ish minutes turned one breaker off, comes to my room to see if power is off, slams the door, repeat. all while screaming at me. He finally turns the power off for the whole floor. 
He told me I wasn’t going to school until I apologized and we figured this out. I told him he was being very aggressive and i didn’t appreciate it, and that it wasn’t just something you get over. He yells and screams and we go back and forth however many times, him still insisting on me apologizing on toast. he is yelling at me to the point I am mid panic attack having to deal with and respond to him. I said something again about not respecting him and not liking the way he treats my mother, I asked him “hasn’t she asked you for a divorce multiple times? why are you still here we all clearly don’t want you here”, he freaks out and gives me my phone back, it’s about 7:30 at this point. 
I grab it and don’t let go, he grabs for my phone, i turn and he grabs my arm and is fighting me for my phone for a solid 30 seconds. 4 of my press on nails came off in the process as well as me knocking over a candle that almost lit my room on fire. 
i gather my stuff up, him still yelling at me, i tell him i’m not doing this right now and I would be leaving and walking to my friends house up the road. He proceeds to stand in my doorway and not leave despite me telling him to get out and let me leave, I even threatened to jump out the window. He finally gets distracted by my grandmother coming upstairs and leaves, giving me an opportunity to get out of my room. I get my stuff together, he is telling me i’m not going to school and i’m not going to work and he would call my boss personally and tell them i couldn’t come in (he has threatened and done this in the past with a different job). I told him no, I would be going to both school and work and if he tried to pick me up I wouldn’t get in his car. 
I went to my friends house, after him accusing me of manipulating the whole situation and making him out to be the bad guy every time. 
I told my mom all that happened and she told me or he showed up to call the police. He did show up, but I had told my manager and she got me out early. I stayed the night at a friends and the day after my mom got home and we sat down and had a conversation with my dad about his behaviour and he had gone too far and it was time for a divorce. 
He seemed like he had no idea it was coming and tried to say he just wanted to fix it. When a pattern has been going on for almost 16 years like this, it is time to end it.
He is currently living in a room in my basement and is only supposed to enter through the garage door and use the coffee maker and microwave in his room to cook unless he has cleared it with us first. 
My father doesn’t contribute financially much, he is extremely unreliable in this department. My mother has had to pay his bills for him, he only pays the electric and gas bill and my mother pays the rest. He doesn’t make enough to afford rent where we’re located, so he is unable to move out (his words, not mine). He had texted my mom and told her hes not leaving the house until she has bought him out, for the record SHE PAYS THE MORTGAGE HE PAYS NOTHING. I’m not too sure how that whole situation works but what I do know is I need him out. I am considering reaching out to my guidance counsellor about getting cps involved because quite honestly this is affecting me so much. It’s not physical abuse and I know people have it so much worse out there but it’s not fair that I have to come home to this everyday. It’s like he has manic episodes or something I don’t know who he is anymore. When he leaves the house he is a different person, everyone loves him and he’s so friendly. 
He’s been sending me text messages too which are basically begging me to talk to him and hes sending me tiktok’s that are getting weird. 
my mom is scared of putting her foot down so me doing this is the only way he will be leaving. I’m scared that CPS won’t help me fast enough because I’m almost 17. 
I know Ive left a lot of details out, so feel free to ask any clarifying questions. Would CPS help? Is it severe enough they’d even help? How should I go about this? Should I do it? ",1,1735611660.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False
1hq4co9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1hq4co9/how_do_i_resolve_feelings_of_loneliness/,How do I resolve feelings of loneliness?,"So I am a medical resident doing my training. My life was spent mostly studying for grades and med school. I was pressured by parents and a desire to prove to my parents that I was good enough to be a doctor so I never dated anyone. 

In my program all of my coresidents we have a friendly coworker relationship but all of them have boyfriend, married or kids so they have their responsibilities and social circle.

In the first 3-4 months of residency I was learning how to be an intern and studying for step 3.

I love doinng and learning to be an intern resident.


Then in I worked with another resident who was kind, beautiful and we shared a lot of interests. But she had a complicated past with a kid and being a single mom. I initially had feelings for her but knew that she deserved better and it would be best to be friends
So I would try to hangout at work when we were at different rotations just because I felt the closest to her. She was always nice, hugged me. I gave her a Christmas present of her favorite coffee and some cutesy stuff because I felt that she had a lot on her plate. I texted to hangout with her during Christmas but she wanted to be with her family so fair. I apologized for being forward and disrupting her family time.

After meeting that other resident I felt like there was a hole punched in a dam where I started feeling lonely because of a lack of romantic partner and a deep friendship where you can just talk about random shit or just pop by their house just to chat.

Another issue arose when my best friend from med school in another residency program texted a couple of weeks ago saying how were things going. We hadn’t kept in touch because of being with residency. I was in the lonely spiral and admitted my past feelings for her and I apologized for my emotional cowardice and wanted to be friends and she did initially say we could be friends no problem. 

Then on Christmas I tried texting to see if she was free just to talk for fun because I was bored working at the hospital. She said she was with family so fair. I just left it there

On Saturday I tried texting to just to keep in touch and then she said I was just hoping we could be casual friends. I have a boyfriend and I think we should not be so connected. I was stupid and tried to call just to clear stuff up. She said that she was with family and couldn’t chat. I texted an apology


How do I not let my loneliness rule me and make me day and do stupid shit?

Like this has gone from minor thought in the back of my mind to being a consuming thought that I am trying to fight back.

At this point I just want to fix my friendship and find friends. Like I know I have a far distance to be able to get a girl",1,1735611659.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

Massive migraines,"Hello friends, I hope today finds you well and out of pain! I'm trying to get my story out there cause at 30 years old I'm the only person I know like this, and wanting to understand more about it. 

The first time I got an ocular migraine I was 18, living away from my family and thought I was forsure dying. Blindness/aura in one eye, unbelievable pain I'm my head and constant vomiting, for 4 to sometimes 16 hours. For 12 years I suffered with these and at almost 31 I think I've narrowed it down to everything that causes these for me.

It's basically stimulants. I was very addicted to cigarettes, coffee/energy drinks, experimented with illicit drugs, and after weening off all these things I rarely get them. I did the closest thing to an elimination diet that I could and as I would drink energy drinks or eat salami or breads with nitrates I realized I would react extremely violently to these. The last migraine I had I threw up so much I was dehydrated to the point my entire abdomen was cramping for hours.

I'll list out every ingredient that's made me feel these affects in hoping that it helps someone else. Keep in mind I went 12 years with these extremely common things in our society not realizing it was killing me. I'm hoping I can meet more people like this and talk to more doctors or anyone that knows what's going on, because as I'm sure everyone here knows, true migraine information is kept incredibly suppressed, or so it seems. It's crazier because when I asked a doctor about what to do they just said ""drink more caffeine, it's good for migraines"" and one ingredient I'm allergic to listed as a vitamin! The food system in our country is f***ed and I feel like it's causing most of our issues... anyways please share what you guys wish! Here's the ""allergen"" list:

- Caffeine
- Nicotine
- Chocolate (has Caffeine and beta-phenylethylamine, known to cause headaches)
- B vitamins (B1, B6, B12, thiamin mononitrate* is found in most products that contain pork or eggs. It's in most pepperonis, sausages, bacon, breads and shelf snacks as a preservative. If you want these look for uncured meats and foods that use sodium phosphates instead. This is salt based instead of petroleum based 🤮)

Trader Joes and carob chocolates have been my friend through this. Opted for swiss water process decaf coffee when I wanted coffee... I'll continue to add more as I think about it ❤️

For the next few weeks I'm going to be coming into Manhattan from The Bronx to work on several projects. Normally I work remotely but I have a ton of stuff going on and it will be best for me to just position myself in town 4-5 days a week to be available for meetings, do site visits, keep away from domestic distractions etc. 

Before the pandemic I had a collection of places that I could drop in to work; libraries, open dinning halls, coffee shops, atriums, etc. But most of them have closed or transformed. 

I fully realize that people may not want to share their awesome private, quiet spot with free wifi. But If anyone could share such a place I would be deeply appreciative.

p.s. I appreciate that I should be thinking about renting an office or coworking space. My business doesn't warrant a full time space. And, for whatever reason, I prefer the fractious energy of a public space to the rented privacy of a Co-working space. ",2,1735611627.0,AskNYC,1,1.0,False

1hq4bjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1hq4bjh/do_i_kick_my_dad_out_officially/,Do I kick my dad out officially?,"Let me preface this by saying i’m F, almost 17 and my father has acted this way almost my entire life. Recently, he crossed a line and continues to cross them. I’m unsure if I am taking this too far but people in my life are telling me it’s bad and i need to do this. 

My dad has been overbearing my entire life, he has anger issues yet denies he has them. He has screamed at my younger brother (11), myself and my mother to the point of panic attacks on multiple occasions through the years. He has locked my mother in a car, causing her a panic attack because he wanted to have “a conversation” with her. His conversations involve him telling you his opinion, and not leaving you alone until you agree with him. He rants in your face and gets very upset when you do not agree with him. Until now, nothing has ever been physical and I do believe it was a temporary lack of judgement but that doesn’t make it okay. 
I have been gathering voice memos of him yelling at people in my household for the last four months. His arguments are very childish and I believe he has something going on with his brain because he is SO bipolar.

He’s very “I’m your dad you need to respect me”. 
I’ll detail the turning point now, Two weeks ago now I had just gotten home from school, he told me he was making dinner for 5:30-6:00ish and i said okay. It was 4:40pm and i hadn’t eaten all day so i went into the kitchen and made a piece of toast. He turns around and gets very upset at me because “now i wouldn’t eat my supper”, I told him I had hardly eaten all day and was hungry. He was upset and said i just made toast to defy his authority. He said I didn’t respect him, and I said “do you give me a reason to?” he got very upset and asked what i meant, I said he treated everyone in this household like crap and I was done with it. He dropped it for a minute, visibly angry but went and did some dishes. I buttered my toast and took it to my room. 
He proceeds to storm in, asks me to apologize to him, I refuse because why should I when I’m just calling him out on his behaviour, he takes my phone, and then takes my toast. He gets mad and stalks off to go smoke.

Dinner happens, I eat all my supper wow. 
11pm now, i go in and ask him for my phone in the morning for school, telling him i don’t need it now but i do need it for that. He refuses, I tell him I am unsafe at school and need it. He gets upset and starts yelling, asking me to apologize about making the toast and apologize about what I said to him. I refuse again, and go downstairs to text my mother (who is away on business) on my grandmothers phone who lives in our basement. I detail the situation, and ask if she can confirm I can have my phone tmr morning. I stay with my grandmother for two hours because she thought he’d blow up at me again.

The next morning, I awake to screaming threats of him cutting my phone bill and turning off the electricity to my room because “I don’t deserve it”. He wakes me up at 6:20am and proceeds to walk in my room, go to the garage where the breaker panel is and for the next 30ish minutes turned one breaker off, comes to my room to see if power is off, slams the door, repeat. all while screaming at me. He finally turns the power off for the whole floor. 
He told me I wasn’t going to school until I apologized and we figured this out. I told him he was being very aggressive and i didn’t appreciate it, and that it wasn’t just something you get over. He yells and screams and we go back and forth however many times, him still insisting on me apologizing on toast. he is yelling at me to the point I am mid panic attack having to deal with and respond to him. I said something again about not respecting him and not liking the way he treats my mother, I asked him “hasn’t she asked you for a divorce multiple times? why are you still here we all clearly don’t want you here”, he freaks out and gives me my phone back, it’s about 7:30 at this point. 

I grab it and don’t let go, he grabs for my phone, i turn and he grabs my arm and is fighting me for my phone for a solid 30 seconds. 4 of my press on nails came off in the process as well as me knocking over a candle that almost lit my room on fire.

I'm going to DL training soon, and I'm trying to plan as well as possible for not having any meals provided. If you have input from your training experience, I would LOVE any tips \*\*edit to add\*\* for saving money / any logistics I should know.\*\*

Breakfast: I'm least worried about this meal--I've heard to bring Keurig pods for coffee, and I know it's a possibility that the hotel might provide breakfast. I'm going to buy lots of bagels, fruit, protein bars etc. from the grocery store for breakfast.

Lunch: Is there a lunch break during the training day during which we should plan to bring a packed lunch? Or is there a cafeteria on Delta's campus where we can buy food? Can we go off campus? If so, do you have recommendations for cheap places nearby?

Dinners: I think I'm most concerned about dinners because this is where it will be difficult to not be able to cook, and the cost of prepared meals, even from the grocery store, could add up fast. I'm anticipating getting lots of bagged salad kits from the grocery store, having a loaf of bread and peanut butter and jelly on hand...but I'm definitely concerned about not having a way to cook. Would it be useful to get a HotLogic for the hotel room? I'm guessing none of the training hotels are ""extended stay"" type ones with kitchenettes...any and all helpful hints and advice welcome!",2,1735611498.0,cabincrewcareers,8,0.75,False

Here is my list of what's allowed, incase anyone could use some inspiration:

\- essential hygiene & cleaning supplies  
\- haircuts  
\- replacement housewares  
\- replacement phone (if needed)  
\- replacement shoes & socks  
\- replacement clothing (must be thrifted)  
\- groceries and snacks out (no coffee/Starbucks drinks and any meals out must be with friends)

I'm a little nervous because I definitely resorted to window (and occasional) shopping in 2024. I felt a little depressed realizing I didn't enjoy it as much anymore, but it is a habit I'm now faced with replacing. I want to get back into reading but my attention span has waned over time. So we'll see how that goes....

I'm happy to say I did a lot of decluttering this past year. Most of it was fast fashion I had accumulated during the pandemic, and I ended up feeling guilty throwing it away. Though I wore most of it, it was a waste and I'm now planning to cut it out permanently. I agree with youtubers who say it's better to buy fewer high quality items because it adds up.

Who else is doing. a No Buy or Low Buy and do you have any tips?",52,1735611388.0,minimalism,15,0.98,False
