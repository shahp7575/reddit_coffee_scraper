1mcp551,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcp551,Rating the new Raspberry Cream Ghost!,"This is my first time posting from web so apologies if the post looks weird! I‚Äôm not super well versed when it comes to macros so I‚Äôm not going to rate macros but here‚Äôs my flavor/can design rating!

Flavor: 8/10
I didn‚Äôt LOVE the flavor but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty on point. I definitely get a good mix of raspberry and cream, though it‚Äôs a bit more heavy on the raspberry in comparison to the cream. (which works super well imo). When it comes out in stores, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd see myself buying it often. I‚Äôm glad I got to try it though!

Design: 10/10
The design looks incredibly cool, there‚Äôs not much more to say about it üò≠ I don‚Äôt think they could have made it look any nicer tbh. I love the color scheme!

1mcp4gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyperacusis/comments/1mcp4gs/guanfacine_for_cns_relaxation/,Guanfacine for CNS relaxation?,"Just learned of Guanfacine which is used for diabetic neuropathic pain and adhd, mainly for impulsivity and anxiousness in thoughts and emotions. I'm not educated enough to figure if it could parallel with hyperacusis or not, but wondering if anyone has used this drug at any point throughout their hyperacusis journey?

I think the primary blockage for my healing is the tightness/alertness in my CNS. I'm quitting coffee again (I restarted drinking after my H got good past a threshold), but I'm having trouble in deeply relaxing.

This is why I think baclofen has been helpful for me. I think its also why a strong meditation practice helped me heal quicker in my first critical onset, which is lacking now. 

Anti-anxiety meds dont seem like a good option as I find them way too addictive, and SSRI's are above my risk tolerance due to potential permanent side effects.


If not Guanfacine, do we have any anecdotes or studies of people with some kind of Allodynia trialing similar drugs?

Sorry if this is a broken record, I was looking through the sub for up to date answers but came up empty. 

Myself and my partner (both in our early 20‚Äôs) have recently moved to Leith. We live in the Maritime Lane area, we have been here just under a month and have had a walk around the local area to try and find our bearings, seems to be loads of newish/ trendy restaurants and coffee shops around the canal and it looks lovely. 

However, we aren‚Äôt naive and know even the most beautiful areas can still have their dodgy parts. For context, we moved here from Liverpool which I would definitely not consider a safe city (not due to scousers they are lovely people but there‚Äôs just high levels of crime). We were uni students and lived in very sketchy areas (Toxteth if anyone reading is familiar with Liverpool) so we are used to keeping our wits about us. 

Just wondering from the locals who have been here a while what the situation is with Leith? I haven‚Äôt had any bad interactions at all so far, I‚Äôve seen some slightly odd stuff but it‚Äôs stuff that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have even thought twice about in Liverpool so I‚Äôm not majorly concerned. I think I‚Äôm just trying to navigate how switched on I need to be living here as a young female travelling often alone to and from work etc. 

Any advice would be great, and be honest! I‚Äôve got thick skin so even if you tell me this is the worst area I could have picked I promise I will still sleep at night. Our building is very secure so it‚Äôs more for commuting purposes than anything else. ",0,1753826855.0,Edinburgh,0,0.5,False

My fianc√© got all of his upper teeth (11 in total) extracted, as well as a sinus lifting 10 days ago all  in one go - he had an issue with his bone and it was necessary. While he was recovering, I took care of him of course, cooked a lot of soft foods and purr√©d them so that he could eat properly without his upper teeth. Gave him all the meds, always did whatever he asked. Always stayed home with him and spoke with his friends/colleagues over the phone, as he was self conscious the way he sounded. He would always whine and demand attention like a little child - I tried to do the best I could, but I‚Äôm not going going to lie, hearing a 43 year old man whine all the time made me very annoyed. We didn‚Äôt have any fights during his recovery time after the first procedure, just as days passed he grew to be a little bit rude, would make unnecessary and rude remarks in front of his friends who would come over to visit him. He‚Äôs also a heavy smoker and would smoke a lot in the bathroom - I would always ask not to do it, but it would always get ignored so this combined + the rudeness would slowly build up my anger inside. However, we didn‚Äôt really fight, as I understood that he was in a lot of pain during this time and I just chose to keep it within myself.

Then, 3 days ago it was time for the second part of the procedure - they have installed 8 implants where his teeth were removed (the surgeon explained earlier and even after the surgery that it would be much easier and less traumatic/painful than the first part of the surgery where they had to remove all the teeth + sinus lifting). When we got home after the surgery my fianc√©‚Äôs mood was totally normal, however he did say that he was in a lot of pain and he even said ‚Äúit feels like a grenade has exploded in my mouth‚Äù. The next day, however, he invited his friends over to chill at our house. I made a light dinner for all of us, tea, desert, did everything I could to make everyone happy and my fiance. Once again, just for info. Whilst his friends were over, he would continue making rude remarks, be angry at me ( I could see with his body language and heavy stomping) since I wasn‚Äôt preparing/cleaning fast enough + ask me to do many things (ordering uber eats, bringing him this and that, giving him food from the fridge etc). I didn‚Äôt say a word about him being rude, just gave him a very very blank stare.

The next morning (today), just like any other day, I had to wait 30 minutes for him to get out of the bathroom where he had his morning routine (drinking coffee, reading news online, infinite scrolling and obviously smoking cigarettes one after another. I couldn‚Äôt use a bathroom + had to wait after for the smell to air out as I get horrible headaches when straight after waking up I have to smell cigarette smoke in a small space. I‚Äôve had enough and told him that this can‚Äôt continue. That I‚Äôm sick of him smoking so much (which is btw very bad in general, but especially for the gums after a surgery like that), that I can‚Äôt use the bathroom in the morning when I need it, that he grew to be very rude and mean, swear a lot at me, all whilst I take care of him. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not perfect either. I‚Äôm not as organized as him, sometimes I forget to take out the trash etc, I wouldn‚Äôt hang laundry as perfect as he wants lol. All these little flaws would drive him crazy and he got so upset and angry at me, at what I‚Äôve told him everything that I mentioned above.

It hurt me so much. I immediately left the house to go to the gym and later stayed outside for a few hours, as I didn‚Äôt want to go home and decided to let him cool off. When I got back, I tried to hug him and told him that we shouldn‚Äôt fight like that and he just erupted again - telling me that he doesn‚Äôt need my care, my presence or anything else. That I‚Äôm praising myself and that I made it sound like an accomplishment earlier today. That he can take perfect care of himself. I just closed my eyes on this despite feeling very hurt and later cooked him dinner and served it - he didn‚Äôt eat it, as a protest I guess - and made his own food. I just sobbed silently. Everytime he‚Äôd get up from the sofa, it would be accompanied by heavy stomps, swearing, smashing kitchen cabinets and doors.

As I‚Äôm typing this alone in a bedroom, it just feels like I‚Äôm describing a spoiled teenager. But please help me with a kind advice - I‚Äôm so so upset and hurt, I don‚Äôt know how to approach him tomorrow. We‚Äôve been together for 9 years (couldn‚Äôt get married earlier due to some legal issues) and have been through fire and ice. However, his behavior in this situation deeply upsets me and I‚Äôm so hurt. I‚Äôve been taking a lot of homeopathic meds to reduce my stress and anxiety, but even with these meds, they don‚Äôt help much in this situation. I‚Äôve also tragically lost my best friend of 10 years less than 2 months ago, so all of these together combined just makes me feel so alone, hurt and drained. I was thinking of leaving and going to my mother‚Äôs apartment for the night (she‚Äôs not there currently as she‚Äôs traveling).  But I just feel so guilty leaving him alone in this state.  I just want to quit fighting and living in this amount of stress. How can I make things work when he‚Äôs so mad and rude of the time?

I wanted to share something I‚Äôve been building that combines digital planning with a bit of whimsy and warmth.

I‚Äôve always loved those isometric room illustrations ‚Äî the ones where a little character is chilling in a cozy space, reading a book, sipping coffee, cleaning, etc. They always gave me this calm, motivating feeling. So I thought‚Ä¶ what if my planner *looked and felt* like that?

That‚Äôs how I started designing a digital planner that turns your tasks into tiny animated scenes.

* If your task is ""write journal"" ‚Üí you see your avatar writing in a notebook in a soft-lit room
* ""Workout"" ‚Üí they do some home stretches or light exercise
* ""Clean"" ‚Üí your little character vacuums a pastel-toned floor Every task comes alive in a visual, cozy way.

I‚Äôm generating these animations myself using MidJourney and image-to-video AI tools ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bit of a time-consuming process, but the first set is already live, and I‚Äôm planning to add many more for common tasks, moods, and even different room aesthetics (modern, cottagecore, study corners, etc.).

üí≠ I‚Äôd really love to get your feedback:

* What kind of room styles do you love in your digital planners?
* Would you prefer animations that are minimalist or more detailed and decorative?
* If it were interactive (e.g., tap to customize or collect items), what would you want?

My hope is to make planning feel less clinical and more like something you *look forward to* ‚Äî especially for folks who thrive with visuals or need a little extra dopamine to stay on track.

‚ÄúEvery tick is a secret. Ready to listen?‚Äù

**1. Why the Ordinary Looks Empty**

Most days we drift through the hours wearing logic-shaped blinders. We wake at 07:15, gulp coffee, swipe screens, and march along routes so familiar the scenery fades to wallpaper. Habits keep life efficient‚Ä¶ and keep whole universes out of sight.

Think of your attention as a nightclub bouncer: it lets known faces in and waves everyone else away. Only when something jolts the bouncer (an odd number plate, a strange smell, a sudden laugh) do we notice how crowded the room really is.

Chaos scientists call these habit-loops attractors. Picture a marble dropped into a soup-bowl: no matter where it starts, gravity pulls it to the dip in the middle. Our routines are bowls in time. Chance might jiggle the marble, but it still ends up in the dent, unless something flips the bowl.

**2. Flipping the Bowl: The Random Alarm**

Enter the Chronomancy app. Once a day, or twice, or ten times (your choice), it will ping at a second nobody, not even you, can predict. When the chime slices the moment like a bright coin on marble, you stop. You look. You listen.

That single act of noticing at an un-patterned instant cracks open reality‚Äôs shell. Suddenly you glimpse:

the bat napping under the bathroom eave you‚Äôve never examined,

the stranger‚Äôs sentence that seems harvested from your own diary,

the way afternoon sun dusts a concrete wall gold, then lilac, then indigo.

Each ping is the White Rabbit flicking his pocket watch and whispering: You‚Äôre late for a moment that exists only now.

**3. Beginner Spells**

When the alarm calls, become a Chronomancer:

**Scan the scene** ‚Äì Name three details you‚Äôd normally ignore: a purple leaf, the hum behind the light-bulb, graffiti half-scrubbed away.

**Hunt the odd** ‚Äì Anything mildly off-beat counts: twin strangers on the same bench, a song lyric echoing a thought you just had.

**Log it** ‚Äì Drop a note or photo in the community feed. Patterns love company.

**Time-pen-pal** ‚Äì Re-read your notes next week. Future-you will notice links today-you missed.

**Invent quests** ‚Äì Next alarm, focus only on sounds. Another day, only numbers. Curiosity is the fuel; the app supplies the spark.

**4. Sync-Events: When Many Marbles Jump Together**

Now and then the app picks the same random second for thousands of users. For a heartbeat the world becomes a gigantic mirror ball, every facet catching the same flash of light.

Why bother? Because randomness usually cancels itself out, like a million pendulums swinging out of sync. But give all those pendulums one identical shove and they lock into a brand-new rhythm. Shared surprise bends probability in fresh directions. What slips through might be subtle (a chorus of identical dreams, a wave of d√©j√†-vu tweets) or something wilder. Nobody knows; that‚Äôs the thrill.

If the math talk feels heavy, skip it and keep exploring. Mystery works whether you can recite the equations or not.

**5. Last Word from the Pocket-Watch Rabbit**

Your life is a tunnel built from hours and habits. Chronomancy drills peepholes in the walls. Peek through often enough and the tunnel dissolves into open sky.

So turn on the random alarm. Carry a notebook. Walk slow after each ping. The hidden seconds have been waiting a long time to meet you.

1mcougp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcougp,Am I overreacting? I don't feel this friendship is safe and no longer want to foster the connection,"Hello! I'm 32F feeling a little shell-shocked after my friend (let's call her Alice F36) of a few years came to visit me in a new city I just moved to. For some context, I didn't have a supportive or safe family growing up so friendships mean the world to me, sometimes even at my own expense. So what's occurred over the past few days is deeply troubling to me as I can honestly say I try my best to show up for the people I care about. This friend and I met a few years back when I was still living in the same city. We met each other on a neighborhood walking tour in 2022 and hit it off and she invited me out for some drinks. I took her up on it and it just so happened we lived a block from each other. We maintained a good friendship and then last year I decided on a career change and moved abroad. We kept up in texts and voice notes and up until last week counted her as one of my closest friends.

Recently she needed to go back to her home country to collect a cheque and I happen to live in the neighboring country. She just got burnt by a guy that she's hung onto for a few years who wouldn't commit, so she asked me to go with her on a vacation for a week. I'm in school, deeply committed to making this career change, so l avoid expensive vacations. I'm also not in a headspace to take time off.

Instead I offered that she could come visit me in my city instead. She had suggested the idea of visiting last year, but changed her mind last minute. So I was overjoyed she was coming finally! This was all discussed over a matter of weeks and I wanted to be honest about my priorities, so I let her know l'd be busy during the day working at the studio, and that I was headed out of the country soon after. She and I discussed a little beach vacation over the weekend, which I said could be a good idea. She then sent a list of airbnbs, but because it's the summer, all the airbnbs were booked up and for the really nice one she wanted, we would have had to leave on Thursday. I was co-hosting a party with a friend (let's call her Emma) on Friday, so I let her know, and she was blind-sided a little bit. The party was in the works, but we didn't have a date set and it wasn't going to be at my place, so I wasn't in a rush to mention it, but looking back I should have. I offered to move the party date to Thursday instead so we could head out Friday. The aironb was expensive as well, and I saw there were two bedrooms in the photo. I admit this next part was entirely my fault. I offered to ask another friend (let's call her Emma F47) to come with us, so that the cost would be more bearable. She agreed and so did the other friend.

Unfortunately, looking at the details there was a two person maximum, and I was at a loss at what to do because I definitely didn't want to pay for the expensive airbnb and l've just asked another friend to join a trip. So I took initiative and found a different airbnb by the beach that could fit us 3. Everyone agreed.

Things were looking good!

This friend arrives and initially things seem to be going okay. I took her to a nice restaurant I knew she would like (and she did!), and then a nice bar. Emma who was coming on the trip with us joined at the bar. But then came the criticisms. Alice apparently did not get good vibes from Emma. It didn't seem to me that Emma was acting antagonistically at all, so I was confused where all the judgement was coming from. The next morning she went out early for coffee, so I texted her I was headed to the studio but I apparently agreed to get coffee even though I didn't remember that at all? I'll admit I can be forgetful sometimes, so there's a chance I said l'd like to, but then slipped my mind. Alice ends up spending the day at the restaurant from the first night, so I meet up with her after studio and she's invited this guy to the party that night. I'm a bit flustered because Emma and I were worried about numbers, so l balk at first, but then agree he can come. So I head home first and help Emma setup a little bit before the party. I message Alice that she could come to the party to hang out with us and even suggested an item from my closet that she could wear if she'd like. She doesn't show up until hours into the party and ignores Emma entirely. Then she leaves and the guests she invited shows up!

It was fine because we didn't have as many people there as we thought, but it was still a bit shocking to Emma and I as we're now accommodating basically strangers.

The rest of the night goes great, and Alice isn't in the apartment the next morning. I call her and join her at a cafe she's at. The atmosphere is already tense, and we get into a discussion on economics. I could sense a potential fight, so I try to change the subject, but she won't let go of it. So it's now a bit awkward. We're discussion plans for the next few hours and she mentions she has a few errands to run (she had a stuff dropped off at a shoe repair and seamstress). I had mentioned wanting to introduce her to a local artisan, who I really admire. I suggested doing that first, but she was stressed about the timing of the shops closing and she mentioned the last place was really close to the apartment, so l thought it was fine, but it turned out the place was quite far. I'm now a bit stressed that we won't make the meeting with the artisan, who I had mentioned since the beginning of the trip. It's fine we make it in time, but she is antagonistic to the artisan and honestly I'm a bit embarrassed at this point.

On top of all this, I received an email that morning that I need to be at the embassy Monday morning in a nearby city for the upcoming travel, which both Emma and Alice knew I was planning, so I let both of them know I will need to leave the beach apartment Sunday night instead of Monday morning to make sure l arrive in the city on time. Emma gets upset that she has to now figure out return travel plans by herself, so she pulls out (I paid for the airbnb and her train ticket) and she refuses to pay for her part, so I'm left with the bill. Turns out I can't cancel the airbnb, so Alice and I agree to go to the beach vacation ourselves.

The trips just devolves from here. On the train seemingly out of nowhere she weaponizes my ketamine depression treatment and asks whether l've been doing more of it because it seems like l've been more absent and forgetful of details she's already told me? I'm honestly shocked at this point and don't know what to say. l've always been a forgetful person, but l'm functional, held great jobs at Fortune 500 companies, gotten great reviews from managers, and doing just fine living abroad studying! So I change the subject and pretend I didn't notice the slight. Once we arrive at the airbnb, it's late, but I know there's a nearby town her friend recommend that she'd like to visit, so I suggest her looking into how to get there. It turns out there's only one bus in the night, so I suggest we plan better to be able to go the next day. She doesn't like this idea, so she's looking on Uber (which I know there definitely aren't). So we go downstairs to ask for a taxi and she makes me call it 3 times! I start getting annoyed, and she starts calling me out for being annoyed! I explain that there is no Uber and that the taxi isn't answering, so l'd like to stick to the neighborhood for the day. Now I feel incredibly upset on my own vacation, and on top of it, feeling bad that l'm getting blamed for feeling annoyed when all l've done was make sure my friend would have a nice beach trip, given my school and financial limitations.

She decides to leave early and well...you can read the texts yourselves. I never would have expected to find myself in this position.

# Best iPhone 8 Cardholder Cases 2025: Slim & Secure!

The iPhone 8, despite its age, remains a popular and reliable smartphone, favored for its compact size and proven performance. As we move into 2025, the need for convenient and secure accessories hasn't diminished, notably when it comes to carrying essential cards. iPhone 8 cardholder cases offer a streamlined solution, combining phone protection with the functionality of a wallet, all in a slim package. This review explores the best iPhone 8 cardholder cases available in 2025, focusing on their design, security features, durability, and overall value. These cases are perfect for minimizing bulk and keeping your essential cards readily accessible.## Key Features Analysis

The best iPhone 8 cardholder cases in 2025 boast a range of essential features that contribute to their utility and appeal.

**Card Capacity:** A paramount feature is the caseS card-holding capacity. Most high-quality cases are designed to securely hold between 2 and 4 cards, including credit cards, ID, and transit passes. The capacity should be enough to cover most users' daily essentials without compromising the slim profile of the case. Overstuffing a case can stretch the material and compromise security.

The construction of the cardholder section is crucial; ideally, it should incorporate a retaining mechanism to prevent cards from slipping out accidentally. Some cases use a slider or a snap-fit design to keep the cards securely in place, even if the phone is dropped or shaken vigorously. The ability to easily access the cards without removing the case entirely is also a key factor.

**Material and Durability:** The material used in the construction of the case significantly impacts its durability and ability to protect both the phone and the cards. Premium materials such as high-grade polycarbonate, TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), and leather offer superior protection against impacts, scratches, and daily wear and tear. The case's edges should be raised slightly to protect the screen and camera lens from direct contact with surfaces.

A durable, well-constructed case will not only provide better protection but will also retain its aesthetic appeal over time. Leather cases, for example, tend to develop a unique patina with use, adding character, while polycarbonate cases are known for their resilience and scratch resistance. Look for cases that have undergone drop testing to ensure they meet industry standards for impact protection.**security Features:** Security is a major concern when carrying credit cards alongside your phone. The best iPhone 8 cardholder cases incorporate features to prevent unauthorized access to your card information. RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) blocking technology is a common security measure, embedding a layer of material that blocks electromagnetic fields used to scan contactless cards.

Another important security aspect is the design of the cardholder compartment itself. A secure closure mechanism is crucial to prevent cards from falling out accidentally. some cases use a combination of snug fit and friction to hold cards in place, while others employ a more sophisticated locking system. Reviewing user feedback on the reliability of the card retention system is important.

**Slim Profile and Ergonomics:** A bulky case can defeat the purpose of owning a compact iPhone 8. The best cardholder cases maintain a slim profile, adding minimal bulk to the phone while still providing adequate protection and card storage. The case should also be ergonomically designed for pleasant handling and easy access to all buttons and ports.

The overall thickness of the case is a key consideration, especially for users who prefer to carry their phone in their pocket. A slim design allows for easy pocketing and prevents the phone from feeling too bulky in the hand. The texture of the case is also important for grip; a non-slip surface reduces the risk of accidental drops.Key features of the best iPhone 8 cardholder cases include:

 High card capacity (2-4 cards)
 Durable materials (Polycarbonate, TPU, Leather)
 RFID blocking technology
 Secure card retention mechanism
* Slim profile and ergonomic design

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions regarding iPhone 8 cardholder cases:

**Will the magnetic strip on my cards be damaged by being close to my phone?**

No,modern smartphones do not typically emit strong enough magnetic fields to damage the magnetic strips on credit or debit cards. While older technology could perhaps pose a risk, the iPhone 8 and similar devices are designed to minimize such interference. Reputable cardholder case manufacturers also take precautions to ensure that the case itself does not create any magnetic interference. Tho, it is indeed always advisable to avoid placing cards directly on charging pads for extended periods.

**how easy is it to remove cards from the case when needed?**

the ease of card removal varies depending on the design of the cardholder case. Some cases feature a cutout or sliding mechanism that allows you to easily push the cards out with your thumb. Others use a tighter fit to ensure the cards are securely held in place, which may require slightly more effort to remove. Look for cases that strike a balance between security and accessibility. Reading user reviews can provide valuable insights into the card removal process for specific models.

**Does using a cardholder case make the iPhone 8 significantly thicker?**

The thickness of the cardholder case depends on its specific design and card capacity. Slim cardholder cases are designed to add minimal bulk to the iPhone 8, typically increasing the overall thickness by just a few millimeters. However, cases with larger card capacities or more robust protection features may be noticeably thicker. Consider your priority ‚Äì balancing slimness with card storage and security ‚Äì to choose the best option for your needs.

*Where the Odds Favor the Glitz, but the Underdog Dreams Big*

**Parsing the Odds: Monaco‚Äôs Implied Probability is a Fortress**  
Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: AS Monaco is the financial services giant of Ligue 1, and Le Havre is the guy trying to open a savings account with a banana as collateral. The odds tell the story. Monaco‚Äôs decimal odds of 1.32-1.36 (implied probability: \~73-75%) scream ‚Äúwe‚Äôre buying coffee for the bookies.‚Äù Le Havre‚Äôs 7.36-8.0 (implied \~12.5-14%)?

**Digesting the News: Promotion Parties vs. Palace Intrigues**  
Le Havre‚Äôs promotion to Ligue 1 is the sports equivalent of a startup pitching to Elon Musk: inspiring, chaotic, and likely to involve a PowerPoint with too many emojis.

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Bundesliga clash that‚Äôs less ‚ÄúDavid vs. Goliath‚Äù and more ‚ÄúGoliath vs. a guy who forgot to bring his lunch money.‚Äù On August 23, Bayer Leverkusen (the pre-season poster child for *goal-scoring efficiency*) faces TSG Hoffenheim, a team that‚Äôs currently navigating the test match equivalent of a maze with a GPS that only knows how to go forward‚Ä¶ and then gets confused by walls. Let‚Äôs dissect this with the precision of a German engineer and the humor of a stand-up comedian who‚Äôs had one too many bratwursts.

### Parsing the Odds: Leverkusen‚Äôs Odds Are About as Surprising as a Solar Eclipse in August

The bookmakers aren‚Äôt just throwing darts here‚Äîthey‚Äôre lobbing hand grenades. Leverkusen is the consensus favorite at **1.42‚Äì1.46 (decimal)**, translating to an implied **70%+ chance to win**. Hoffenheim? A paltry **5.5‚Äì6.25**, or roughly **14‚Äì16%**, which is about the same odds as betting your coffee order will survive a barista‚Äôs ‚Äúcreative interpretation‚Äù of your request. The draw sits at **4.5‚Äì4.8 (20‚Äì22%)**, which is generous enough to let Hoffenheim fans cling to hope like a koala to eucalyptus.

Why the gulf? Let‚Äôs call it the **‚Äú7-0 over Toulouse‚Äù effect**. Leverkusen‚Äôs pre-season has been a masterclass in offensive pyrotechnics, torching RB Leipzig 7-0 and VfL Bochum 2-0. Their attack? A well-oiled *goal machine* that‚Äôs averaging **3.5+ goals per test match**. Hoffenheim, meanwhile, hasn‚Äôt had results highlighted in the provided data (probably because their pre-season has been the Bundesliga version of a power outage at a fireworks show).

‚ÄúEvery tick is a secret. Ready to listen?‚Äù

**1. Why the Ordinary Looks Empty**

Most days we drift through the hours wearing logic-shaped blinders. We wake at 07:15, gulp coffee, swipe screens, and march along routes so familiar the scenery fades to wallpaper. Habits keep life efficient‚Ä¶ and keep whole universes out of sight.

Think of your attention as a nightclub bouncer: it lets known faces in and waves everyone else away. Only when something jolts the bouncer (an odd number plate, a strange smell, a sudden laugh) do we notice how crowded the room really is.

Chaos scientists call these habit-loops attractors. Picture a marble dropped into a soup-bowl: no matter where it starts, gravity pulls it to the dip in the middle. Our routines are bowls in time. Chance might jiggle the marble, but it still ends up in the dent, unless something flips the bowl.

**2. Flipping the Bowl: The Random Alarm**

Enter the Chronomancy app. Once a day, or twice, or ten times (your choice), it will ping at a second nobody, not even you, can predict. When the chime slices the moment like a bright coin on marble, you stop. You look. You listen.

That single act of noticing at an un-patterned instant cracks open reality‚Äôs shell. Suddenly you glimpse:

the bat napping under the bathroom eave you‚Äôve never examined,

the stranger‚Äôs sentence that seems harvested from your own diary,

the way afternoon sun dusts a concrete wall gold, then lilac, then indigo.

Each ping is the White Rabbit flicking his pocket watch and whispering: You‚Äôre late for a moment that exists only now.

**3. Beginner Spells**

When the alarm calls, become a Chronomancer:

**Scan the scene** ‚Äì Name three details you‚Äôd normally ignore: a purple leaf, the hum behind the light-bulb, graffiti half-scrubbed away.

**Hunt the odd** ‚Äì Anything mildly off-beat counts: twin strangers on the same bench, a song lyric echoing a thought you just had.

**Log it** ‚Äì Drop a note or photo in the community feed. Patterns love company.

**Time-pen-pal** ‚Äì Re-read your notes next week. Future-you will notice links today-you missed.

**Invent quests** ‚Äì Next alarm, focus only on sounds. Another day, only numbers. Curiosity is the fuel; the app supplies the spark.

**4. Sync-Events: When Many Marbles Jump Together**

Now and then the app picks the same random second for thousands of users. For a heartbeat the world becomes a gigantic mirror ball, every facet catching the same flash of light.

Why bother? Because randomness usually cancels itself out, like a million pendulums swinging out of sync. But give all those pendulums one identical shove and they lock into a brand-new rhythm. Shared surprise bends probability in fresh directions. What slips through might be subtle (a chorus of identical dreams, a wave of d√©j√†-vu tweets) or something wilder. Nobody knows; that‚Äôs the thrill.

If the math talk feels heavy, skip it and keep exploring. Mystery works whether you can recite the equations or not.

**5. Last Word from the Pocket-Watch Rabbit**

Your life is a tunnel built from hours and habits. Chronomancy drills peepholes in the walls. Peek through often enough and the tunnel dissolves into open sky.

So turn on the random alarm. Carry a notebook. Walk slow after each ping. The hidden seconds have been waiting a long time to meet you.

1mcorid,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mcorid/a_writing_cafe_wouldnt_let_me_leave_until_i/,A Writing Cafe Wouldn't Let Me Leave Until I Finished My Story,"I always loved the idea of being a writer. It was the writing part that I couldn‚Äôt stand.

There were plenty of stories that I‚Äôd started writing, all of them sitting there in my drafts folder with creative titles and inventive character names. But not a single one of them was finished. Each would end abruptly, most not even making it past the drafting stage. I guess I would just get distracted, or let the crappiness of my own writing dissuade me.

Regardless of which, I‚Äôd put any dream of finishing a writing project behind me.¬†

That was, until I heard my friend James talking about the college history paper he‚Äôd completed last month. James was an even bigger procrastinator than me, and was on the verge of being kicked out of college, so this surprised me. He concurred.

‚ÄúDude, I never would have gotten this paper done if I hadn‚Äôt gone to that cafe‚Äù he chuckled to me. ‚ÄúThey literally *made* me finish writing it, it was exactly what I needed haha.‚Äù

Apparently, slacker James had discovered a cafe in our city that catered specifically to writers. So much so that it encouraged people, in whatever ways it could, to put pen to paper and complete their projects. I knew that writers often camped out in cafes like Starbucks and occupied tables with their laptops and notebooks for far too long. Such was the cliche.

But an actual dedicated cafe for writers? That made a lot more sense. I figured this was what I‚Äôd been waiting for my whole life. If this place couldn‚Äôt make me reach the end of a manuscript, then nothing could.

I arrived at the location James gave me on a Saturday morning, Macbook in hand. The cafe looked fairly small from the outside, situated entirely indoors and between two other buildings.

Printed above the door was a quaint sign saying ‚ÄúFinal Draft Cafe‚Äù with Japanese lettering beneath it.¬†

Upon entering the glass door to the cafe, I was quickly met by a friendly server with black hair in a white shirt.

‚ÄúAre you here to write?‚Äù she asked warmly, smiling and eyeing my laptop.

‚ÄúYes‚Äù I replied, taking in the cozy interiors of the surprisingly spacious cafe.¬†

It was mostly empty but had several people dotted throughout it, each either at a booth or a small table, typing away next to half-sipped mugs. Some of this crowd really lived up the stereotype of earthy writers with how dishevelled they looked, I noted to myself. Almost no one registered my presence as my server led me to my booth.

Equipped with a charging dock, spare pens and cute plush handrests, the wooden booth was the perfect place for me to write in. The odds of me finishing my story were already going up. As I got set up to write, the chipper server handed me a paper card to fill out.

If only I knew how much power that little slip of paper would hold, I would have written something very different. Hell, I would have tore it up and walked out right then.

‚ÄúPlease fill out this questionnaire before starting‚Äù the server gently requested. ‚ÄúThis will allow us to help you in achieving your goal.‚Äù

The paper asked me to specify three specifications for while I was here: what I wanted to write, how long I wanted that writing to be, and how intense I wanted my motivational reminders to be.

I had already decided that I wanted to write a novella I‚Äôd long dreamt of‚Äîa story about a young would-be sailor who is stranded at sea when his ship capsizes. The ocean had always enchanted me. I would title it ‚ÄúNot a Drop to Drink‚Äù. I wanted it to be at least 20,000 words.

As for the last question, I thought it was a joke. Of the options ‚ÄúMild‚Äù, ‚ÄúModerate‚Äù and ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù, I randomly picked ‚ÄúModerate‚Äù because I honestly thought it wouldn‚Äôt matter. A ‚Äúmotivational reminder‚Äù from a cafe server wasn‚Äôt going to make or break my story.

With that, I handed the form back to the server, ordered a matcha latte and started writing. For me, the first bursts of story were always the easiest. It was engrossing to recount the first act of young protagonist Drago, who sets out to prove himself on the high seas before running into a massive, inescapable storm.

But, after a few hours of this commitment, the inevitable happened and my attention started to drift. I lazily started looking around the cafe at the other writers, intently tapping away like their lives depended on it. Maybe if I just scrolled on my phone for a bit, my inspiration would return‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHey, what the hell are you doing?!‚Äù

I whirled up from my phone to see the server from before screaming at me.¬†

‚ÄúYou are here to write, *idiot*, not play on your phone!‚Äù she roared, snatching my phone from me. ‚ÄúThis is why you‚Äôre a w*orthless* failure who has never finished anything. Don‚Äôt you want to write something for once instead of being a *disappointment*?!‚Äù

I was speechless as she left the table with my empty dishes and phone. This was so absurd it had to be a joke, right? I looked to my left, at the booth with someone in it.

‚ÄúCan you believe that?‚Äù I asked, stunned.

‚ÄúYou really have no idea, do you?‚Äù the bearded man muttered in a weary voice, not even looking up from his screen. The middle-aged gent was wearing a suit, yet looked a million miles from put together. He was covered in coffee stains, had bags under his eyes and wore the faint scent of urine.

‚ÄúUh, what do yo-‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you think you were signing up for? This cafe really *doesn‚Äôt* let you leave, pal. Not until you‚Äôve finished whatever it is you‚Äôre writing.‚Äù

Panic reaching me, I stood up and spun around the room. I could see those same rundown traits in the other writers now, faces of prisoners instead of patrons. Without even grabbing my laptop, I ran for the door, colliding with its glass frame with a loud thunk.

It didn‚Äôt even budge. Nor did the windows when I desperately pounded on them. Nor did the door to the kitchen when I tried the same. How could no one be able to break out of here? It was a tiny and homely cafe, not Fort Knox prison

‚ÄúDoing that won‚Äôt work, we‚Äôre stuck in here‚Äù sighed a woman nearest to the door, slouched at a computer under a head of frizzled hair. ‚ÄúJust write your story. At least you didn‚Äôt promise to write the next Jane Austin novel‚Äù‚Äîshe gestured to her smudged screen bitterly.

In a daze, I sat back down at my booth. Hopelessly, I tried to comprehend the impossible situation I had signed my way into.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here for a year, I think‚Äù said the man next to me, solidifying my horror. ‚ÄúA whole damn novel, I said I‚Äôd write. I‚Äôd never written anything before this. I watched one stupid sci-fi movie, got inspired, and thought this cafe would be the answer. Like you, I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd *really* keep me here.‚Äù

He finally broke eyesight with his screen, looking me up and down. Then he asked me what writing commitments I‚Äôd promised to the cafe.

‚Äú20,000 words? Oh, that‚Äôs better, especially since you‚Äôve written before. Still not as easy as the yuppies who pledge to write 500 words. They breeze in and out of here like it‚Äôs nothing. Most don‚Äôt even learn of the prison that this place really is. Lucky bastards.‚Äù

His wistful words were interrupted by a server softly reminding him to keep writing.

‚ÄúHi sir, you should probably be getting back your novel now‚Äù she whispered politely. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt *wait* to read it.‚Äù¬†

I couldn‚Äôt believe how differently my booth neighbour was being treated versus the earful I‚Äôd gotten‚Äîuntil I remembered, of course, that I‚Äôd selected ‚ÄúModerate‚Äù reminders. He, on the other hand, likely selected ‚ÄúMild‚Äù ones. A small mercy for him at least.

My fugue state continued on for days. I begrudgingly ordered food and drinks, used my hand rest as a pillow to sleep at my booth, used the tiny cafe bathroom, pleaded with the staff to be let out‚Äîbetween rants from them to me. The restaurant never closed and the servers never seemed to leave. Wherever the inside of this restaurant was, it was a parallel world to the outside world.

These dressing downs of me from the servers were getting nastier and more personal. Despite this, I still couldn‚Äôt bring myself to write. But it was nowhere near as awful as the treatment of those who put down ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù motivation on their form.

Those people, when their time for ‚Äúmotivational reminders‚Äù came, were beaten with kitchen tools, had their workspaces roughed up and were even denied the teacakes and tea they lived off of. Bloodstains replaced coffee stains on their clothes. We received these reminders every few hours. I didn‚Äôt want to have to watch these people die here. My character Drago didn‚Äôt want to watch his crewmates drown, and that‚Äôs why he swam for land.¬†

That was the motivation I needed.

Words started pouring out of me onto my Word document for ‚ÄúNot a Drop to Drink‚Äù. First I‚Äôd written a hundred, then five hundred, then a thousand, then ten thousand. Time had less and less meaning, although days were certainly continuing to pass. For energy, I chugged every beverage on the menu, from black teas to espresso shots to Red Bull cans. In a little over a week, I‚Äôd somehow finished the first draft of my story.

All throughout this time, I saw the occasional new person come and go from the cafe. These newcomers were probably here to write some flash fiction short story, probably regarding my filthy haywire state with the same distaste that I had everyone else initially. They came and went the same day‚Äîsome leaving after being shouted at, like me, but no worse for the wear. I didn‚Äôt even think about trying to escape through the door when it opened for them.

My only salvation would be through what I put on the page.

Editing my story took half the time that it did to write it. All the pieces of it were just coming together and it was practically finishing itself. And then, at long last, my final draft was finished. 20,000 words. 3 weeks. All done.

Summoning my server over to me, I waited hesitantly while she assessed my story. She skimmed the entire thing in just a minute, and yet seemed to have internalised the whole draft. Smiling, she handed my questionnaire form back to my trembling hand, the Completion box at the bottom marked with a tick.

‚ÄúCongratulations, sir‚Äù she smiled, amiable as she‚Äôd been the first day. ‚ÄúYour story is *wonderful*. It evoked Life of Pi with hints of The Odyssey. The resolution of Drago was very satisfying and his character arc was a narrative strong point. Please come back if you ever need help writing a sequel.‚Äù¬†

Shuddering at her words, I didn‚Äôt look back at her or the imprisoned writers as I stepped out of the cafe into the beaming sunlight on the street. The brightness outside made me squint after a month inside. The glass door shut behind me and suddenly I had no proof of what I went through. Except for the novella I‚Äôd written.

Writing down the events of what happened in Final Draft came easily to me, even while sitting free at home instead of imprisoned at the cafe. I‚Äôm not sure how long this creative flow will last, but at least it allowed me to share my experiences. Of my two works, this is the one I want to publish.

At the end of my novella, thirsty shipwreck survivor Drago, upon being finally rescued from his open sea ordeal, immediately drinks an entire galley full of beverages.

1mcoote,https://www.reddit.com/r/BachelorettePlanning/comments/1mcoote/miami_bachelorette_party_weekend_guide_best_ideas/,"Miami Bachelorette Party Weekend Guide: Best Ideas, Tips, Itinerary & Planning Advice üå¥üíÉü•Ç","We had the best time in Miami for my Bachelorette party that the girls & I are still talking about that weekend! And I want to pass on what I now know/have learned in the process from the experiences we had, and let it serve as guidance for those who may need it amidst all the planning and questions that arise. I found that most other posts/comments on Reddit weren‚Äôt actually as helpful as I had hoped, primarily because the information was from 2-3 years ago and was already so outdated that most of the places/clubs mentioned there have long closed.

I left comments on other people‚Äôs posts who were asking for guidance/recommendations in Miami and my inbox blew up with messages and follow up questions. So I figured the best and most constructive way to share our experience and recommendations is through this recap post.

I‚Äôll share the recap and all of my recommendations for clubs, pool parties, how to get on the guest list, restaurants, where to stay, how to get around, etc. Basically everything that you will need to know so you‚Äôre prepped and ready for Miami. Also creating this guide because I wish something like this would have existed when I was planning my Bachelorette party. But luckily we figured it out and came out with amazing memories!

**Overall Impressions:**¬†I‚Äôm so happy that I went with Miami for my Bachelorette party destination. I‚Äôm obsessed with Miami now. It‚Äôs such a beautiful, vibrant and sexy city. There are so many things to do and places to go. We never ran out of ideas or things to do, and everything is so easily accessible.

**Where to stay:**¬†I highly recommend staying in Miami Beach, this way you‚Äôre close to everything and anywhere you go is a quick walk/ride. There are so many hotels right on the beach all along Collins Ave and there are many Airbnb options. The choice you will go with will, of course, ultimately depend on your group‚Äôs budget and group size. Ideally, I think all Bachelorette groups want to be together in one house to hang out. But if you don‚Äôt find a good Airbnb option for your group size, and have to go with a hotel option instead, just ask for the customer service/front desk to get you rooms close together, so it‚Äôs easy for you to go room to room. You could also get one of the rooms that is more like a suite and is bigger, and have it be the designated group hangout spot. In terms of location in Miami Beach, anything on Collins Ave from 5th to 50th St, South Beach, South of Fifth, Sunset Harbor, and West Avenue. Another neighborhood that‚Äôs great in Miami is Edgewater or Design District, while it‚Äôs inland, it‚Äôs still very close to Miami Beach and very easy to get around anywhere. Brickell has its own mini tropical New York vibe but it‚Äôs the furthest neighborhood, so expect to spend a lot more time on commuting and in traffic, and more $ Ubering back and forth to Miami Beach.

**Transportation:**¬†We Ubered everywhere, and needed 2 cars to fit everyone. Everything was very accessible and easy to get to and prices were actually very reasonable. Uber XL was anywhere between $10-20, depending on how far we were going, of course. Premier SUV would be somewhere around double the price of Uber XL. But there are so many Luxury SUVs in Miami that whenever we requested Uber XL, a Luxury SUV showed up every time.

**Restaurants:**¬†There are so many incredible places in Miami. You guys will have a fun time choosing where to go. Here are the restaurants that we loved + new places that recently opened that I‚Äôve been to and loved on my recent trips back to Miami, so you guys have the most updated list to choose from.  
**In Miami Beach:**¬†MILA, Japon at The Setai, Jaya at The Setai, Zaytinya at The Ritz South Beach, Pao at Faena Hotel, WATR at 1Hotel, Cecconis, Call Me Gabby (last three all are great for both lunch or dinner)  
**In Edgewater/Design District:**¬†Zuri, Mandolin (great lunch spot), Dior Cafe (another cute lunch/coffee spot)¬†  
**In Downtown:**¬†Casa Neos, Seaspice¬†  
**In Brickell:**¬†Sexy Fish

We were a big group. It was 13 of us total. Some of the restaurants might ask you for a deposit to secure your reservation or if you request a table outside. It all depends on the size of your group and also on the season. My Bachelorette was in the summer, which is considered to be Miami‚Äôs off season, so mostly all places were more laid back with their policy and we got away without having to do a deposit. The one place that did ask us for a deposit, it was for $25/person, which I thought was more than reasonable and we agreed. There are other places like Kiki on the River that asked us to commit to a minimum spend of $250/person for a table outside, which I thought was ridiculous and not worth it. But as you can see from the list, there are so many options to choose from. Just try to book 1-2 months in advance. Leaving it to the last minute will not go well in Miami, especially for big groups.

**Clubs/Pool Parties:**¬†For everything nightlife/pool parties related,¬†[@theguestlistmiami](https://www.instagram.com/theguestlistmiami/)¬†on Instagram took care of us with everything. They actually ended up saving my entire Bachelorette weekend. They are amazing, very professional, reliable, and communicative/responsive. They have a lot of vip hosts at every venue in the city and can get you on the guest list to anywhere you want to go.

I‚Äôll tell you exactly how my bachelorette weekend almost went to shit so you don‚Äôt make the same rookie mistake I did. The nightlife aspect was the only element that was completely unaccounted for because I read so many other posts and comments on Reddit suggesting to just ‚Äúwing it‚Äù and leave it to the last minute because ‚Äúyou will end up running into so many promoters on the beach or the street‚Äù.¬†*Bad, bad idea and huge mistake.*¬†Yes, you will get approached‚Ä¶ but either by snake oil salesmen or straight up scavenging vultures.

We got to the beach on Friday afternoon as soon as we landed in Miami. We got approached by like 10 different promoters. Some of them tried sell us fake tickets, some tried to sell us tickets to clubs that don‚Äôt even sell tickets, and some were so sketchy promising us the moon. Each approaching promoter was hilariously sketchier than the other. So we decided to go with one that seemed more decent than the rest. He invited us to a pool party at SLS on that Friday afternoon and promised us a ‚Äúvip table and everything is free‚Äù. We get there, and as soon as he walks us in, and counts us like some herd to get credit for us from the pool party, he pulls us aside and tells us to pay him $50 each if we want to be with him at his table and have free drinks. We didn‚Äôt like his attitude and the fact that he deceived us, so we declined to pay. He rolled his eyes and left us. We ended up buying our own drinks at the bar and leaving shortly after.

Later that night, we messaged a different ‚Äúmoon promising‚Äù promoter that we met at the beach, who promised to take us to LIV if we would go with him to Vendome first. We reluctantly agreed because we wanted to go to LIV and heard stories about how expensive it is to get into LIV. We get to Vendome, and same thing happens. He asks us to pay him $50 each to be at his table (we didn‚Äôt even want to be at that club and only went there because he promised he would take us to LIV for free). This time we decided to just pay this guy $50 each (as that‚Äôs what 2 drinks ended up costing us at SLS earlier that day when the other promoter left us hanging).

Everything was going ok, we had some shots and drinks at his table, until 1 hour later when we asked him about LIV. He was stalling and brushed it off saying that the plans have changed and the guest list is closed. We got super annoyed and felt deceived again. We decided to go to LIV anyway by ourselves. We get to LIV, the line at the door was so crazy that we waited 20 minutes to get to talk to a doorman, just so we can get quoted $5k for a table or $200 each just to get in. There‚Äôs no way we were going pay that, so we told the doorman that we were on the promoter‚Äôs guest list (the one who was supposed to take us there). The doorman told us they only do tables or cover charge, and that there is no guest list for LIV and he had no idea who that promoter was. So that guy didn‚Äôt even work there and completely ripped us off!

We decided to continue ‚Äúwinging it‚Äù and go to E11even, just so we can spend more money on Uber going all the way across town, to be quoted even crazier prices at the door. E11even asked us for $7k for a table or $300 each to get in.

I was so frustrated and nearly in tears thinking that my entire Bachelorette weekend would be ruined. The girls & I went on Instagram and started looking up clubs by location, and kept seeing story posts from [@theguestlistmiami](https://www.instagram.com/theguestlistmiami/), so we decided to message them. The fact that it was an actual company and not some random promoter with 100k fake followers or a private account seemed more promising. Especially seeing their online presence, and many people tagging them on instagram in both stories and posts (you can‚Äôt fake those!).

I mentioned to them our earlier experiences and they were very compassionate. They told me that, unfortunately, it happens all the time, especially with beach scammers, lying promoters, and without proper planning. They also confirmed the crazy prices and the fact that there is no guest list at LIV and E11even.

They replied super fast, asked us for pictures of our group, which I find slightly strange, but apparently this is how the guest list works in Miami. They quickly presented us with all of their options available of where we can go so last minute and explained to me how it works.

They recommended us Gala, so that‚Äôs what we decided to go with that Friday night. After we completed the form they sent over to get on the guest list, they immediately got us in touch with a VIP host, who would greet and take care of us.

When we arrived at the club, our host met us at the door, we skipped the entire line outside and he walked us right in. It felt so cool! The host took us to his table, brought us bottles, and he made sure we were having fun. What I also loved and appreciated was that he was very attentive and would check in on us, but he didn‚Äôt hover over us and would just let us have fun and do our thing.

They also ended up surprising me with a Bachelorette sign, which I didn‚Äôt expect or even knew I could ask for. It was very sweet and considerate!

We didn‚Äôt have to pay for any tickets/cover charge at the door, or for any drinks. We had free admission, vip entry, skipping all the lines, and the host brought us more bottles, so we had drinks all night (we even left a full bottle on the table when we were leaving). The only thing we paid was the service fee/tip on the form we completed, as they told us that no promoter or host is allowed to ask us for money.

After that amazing Friday night, I ended up using them for the rest of the weekend! We decided to go for a pool party on Saturday and another nightclub on Saturday night. We went through the same process to get on the guest list and they had their hosts taking care of us. We ended up doing the pool party at Strawberry Moon (the music wasn‚Äôt the best, but we had lots of fun) and later that Saturday night, we went with them to MAD club. Their promoters/hosts for the rest of the weekend were all very professional and attentive.

As you can see, the nightlife aspect was the only part that gave us a tough time in the beginning because I followed poor advice to just ‚Äúwing it‚Äù, instead of being more intentional.

Overall, we loved Miami and had such an amazing experience! It‚Äôs a really fun and vibrant city with so much to offer. I hope you will have the best time in Miami, and with all of this information, you will be better prepared than I was and you won‚Äôt have to waste your time figuring it out as you go.

I think I covered it all but if there‚Äôs anything I left out that you‚Äôre interested in, or if you have any follow up questions, let me know and I‚Äôll cover it! ‚ù§Ô∏è",2,1753825850.0,BachelorettePlanning,0,1.0,False

I'll try to get to the meat here . It's tough making friends as an adult, I'm just being real. I moved to this state when I was 20 .. left a lifelong of childhood friends and started from square one .
I had just had a baby when I moved here and making friends isn't just hard as an adult but it's hard as a mom ü§ß

       I've tried making mom friends and friends in general, some have stuck, but most have not .
My friend count is about 0.5 . I'm okay with this most times, and I also have a bf who is my best friend,so that helps a bit ... 
BF, we'll call him Tommy , has grown up here but we're both a bit socially awkward. Tommy doesn't really have friends either..
      He's pretty into gaming,which is fine because before I was a mom ,I was also into the nerdy stuff. It's definitely taken a back burner since I've been in an 8 year long ""mom mode"" phase. We've had a lot of conversations about magic the gathering and Pokemon. I've expressed interest in fantasy player games .. I'm mostly a PC gamer.

  Anyway , we recently had a conversation about getting out of the house more, that we need some entertainment in our life. We vowed to have more fun, basically.
       One of his coworkers ( also his cousin) was orchestrating a DnD group. I knew they were both planning something in the works that involved two other of his coworkers,one of which was actually a mutual friend of ours. All but his cousin,were newbies to the game . 
   They officially launched a set day for this debacle and decided it was going to be every Tuesday. Their first meetup was last week and leading up to it he kind of made it seem like it was more of a social gathering. He mentioned that our mutual friend , we'll call him Josh -was bringing his GF , That she'll be playing. That his cousins fiance , we'll call her Samantha - was going to be there, that she'll be playing. And his other coworkers,whom I'm not well associated, we'll call him Big - may or may not be bringing his girl. He didn't specify if she would be playing. He went on about how the start up is gonna be slow because there's 2-3 brand freaking new members of their like clan or whatever..
   **Full disclosure I'm not 100% sure how old most of these people are . Everyone is early 30s**


      He eventually asked me to come and attend this gathering, not the game, but he wanted me to come and watch. This would require me to bring my (8yo) son and hoard of things to keep him entertained for the 4-5 hours it would take to complete this game. He assured me that there was a couch my son could hang out on and that BIG is also bringing his (7yo) daughter. This put me at ease knowing there would be some sort of buffer. I could slightly relax from major mom mode and maybe even make a couple new friends with others who aren't playing. It could be a good time. 
   Tommy mentioned to me ,that he was hoping I'll watch them play and then say something like ""can I play too?"" I told him blatantly that I'll watch , but I'm way too socially awkward to do that. I'll reiterate again that if I was formerly invited to play, I would have Said yes. That is the loophole in my social anxiety and I believe he knows that by now? 
     Anyway we get to his cousin's house , we'll call him Mick , he was the dungeon master (obviously) . When we got there Samantha was sitting on the couch, she complimented my pants and we had super small talk. 
Big was sitting in the kitchen, and his daughter was already on the couch watching Pokemon tucked in a blanket.. no big GF though. 
   There was absolutely no seating in Mick and Samantha's house, my son and I ended up sitting on little tables. Josh showed up late and also didn't bring his GF. Suddenly things shifted to weird really quick..
Mick took a tiny coffee table and placed it in the kitchen. He called all intended players to the kitchen and they formed a little huddle behind the counter. 
   This left me alone with just my son and Bigs daughter . My son brought his computer ,for which there was nowhere to put it ,but it didn't take long for him to start asking me when we're going home. 
I tried to listen to their game and pay attention to it  from the other room, but they quite LITERALLY had all their backs to me. I heard Mick make a formal announcement before starting the game that him and Samantha were pregnant. Everyone said congratulations. Honestly I felt kinda weird not congratulating her from the other room , but  I don't even know if the announcement was for me lol üòÖ
    The playthrough went on for 4-5hrs and they didn't acknowledge us in the living room once. It was arguably the most boring and AWKWARD situation I've ever experienced. This was the first time I was coming to this home btw , and only the second time meeting these cousins. Bigs daughter seemed extremely uncomfortable as well and didn't acknowledge my son.. probably for the better honestly because he was not in the mood ,he was so bored lol 
     I didn't express to Tommy how this experience was for me , and he was SO HAPPY that I was there to experience that with him. I was okay with making the sacrifice, but I think he sensed the weirdness too. 
  He actually suggested starting to host at our house since we have a whole empty spare bedroom for the ordeal, more seating, more accommodating for the kids, and honestly more comfortable in my own element. Also bonus points that our house is closer to everyone else than Micks .
   Tommy brought this up to Mick but he told him that ""Samantha is weird about new places so IDK"" and then Tommy mentioned how much more accommodating our house would be for everyone involved and then Mick said ""Samantha has an allergy against cats"" . We kinda stopped pushing the issue after that, but I think it's worth mentioning that they have 3 dirty dogs in their house and the first time I met them they literally had a layer of dog hair covering their whole camper I am not exaggerating about that ( they no longer live in the camper) I couldn't even stand to sleep on the couch that night. I'm aware that the pet dander is different , but I digress.
    Today it's time for the 2nd meet and I decided not to attend this time. I kind of expected him to try to convince me , but he didn't protest. Why won't he just ask me to play the freaking game . Ugh.
   I'm looking for insight on the whole scenario but my main question is this.

     Where these people acting funny towards me? 

I'm not sure if my self deprecation and social hyper awareness is just messing with my head and causing self isolation or what.. 




TL;DR :: 
My (28f) BF (27m) started a DnD club with his cousin and some co workers and their girlfriends. He invited me to watch, but not play. I watched and the other people were super weird to me and I decided it was too awkward of an experience to attend again but now I'm feeling FOMO .

Most cat mugs are made from ceramic, porcelain, or stoneware. Ceramic mugs are generally affordable and widely available, offering a good balance of durability and heat retention. Porcelain mugs are finer and more delicate, offering a more refined look and better heat retention. Stoneware mugs are heavier and more rustic, known for their durability and resistance to chipping.In 2025, we‚Äôre seeing an increased focus on eco-friendly materials like bamboo fiber and recycled glass, catering to environmentally conscious consumers.

**Design & Artwork:** The design is what truly sets a cat mug apart, reflecting your personal style and love for all things feline.

Cat mug designs range from simple silhouettes and paw prints to intricately detailed illustrations of various cat breeds. Some feature whimsical cartoon cats, while others showcase realistic portraits. 3D designs, with sculpted cat ears, tails, or paws, are also popular. Heat-changing mugs,which reveal a hidden cat design when filled with hot liquid,offer a fun and interactive experience.In 2025, we are seeing augmented reality (AR) cat mugs that, when viewed through a smartphone app, bring the cat design to life with animations and sounds.

**Size & Capacity:** The size of the mug determines how much liquid it can hold, influencing its practicality for different beverages and occasions.

Standard cat mugs typically hold between 10 and 16 ounces. Smaller mugs (8-10 ounces) are suitable for espresso or smaller servings of coffee or tea. Larger mugs (16+ ounces) are ideal for those who prefer a generous serving or enjoy drinks like lattes or hot chocolate. Consider your typical beverage consumption and choose a mug size that comfortably accommodates your needs. Some cat mugs even come in oversized ""soup mug"" sizes for extra coziness.

**Handle Comfort & ergonomics:** The handle is a crucial element of a cat mug, impacting its comfort and ease of use.

A well-designed handle should be easy to grip and hold, even when the mug is full. Look for handles that are large enough to accommodate your fingers comfortably and that are positioned to provide a balanced and secure grip. Some cat mugs feature ergonomic handles designed to reduce strain on your wrist and hand. Pay attention to the shape and material of the handle ‚Äì a smooth,rounded handle is generally more cozy than a sharp or angular one.

Key features of a top-tier cat mug in 2025 include:

* High-quality, durable material (ceramic, porcelain, or stoneware)
* Unique and eye-catching cat design with vibrant colors
* Comfortable handle for a secure grip
* Microwave and dishwasher safe for convenient use

1mcokf0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcokf0,New Impact tamper Mhw-3bomber ‚ÄúKnight‚Äù,"I am going to start by saying that I have no affiliation with Mhw-3bomber or any other coffee accessory company for that matter. I was recently in the market for a new tamper and asked Reddit what I should get, I had pretty much decided on the decent v6 tamper because of the recommendations and the walnut option that you can get from them. However I then looked at the Mhw3 website and noticed a newly released impact tamper dubbed the ‚Äúknight‚Äù tamper that peaked my interest. 

I looked at the knight tamper and compared it to the Yu series impact tamper that they also offered and I couldn‚Äôt figure out the difference so I emailed the company. They responded saying that the Yu series uses an impact spring to assist in tamping, however a lot of the work was done by the force of the user pushing the tamper. While the Knignt impact tamper pretty much only uses the force of the impact generated by the spring when actuated. They said that this translates to a less manual feel, a lighter actuation, less effort by the user, and more consistency due to less user input. This intrigued me as it sounded like this tamper was more similar to the force tamper that has been popular for a while now. 

As someone who was really interested in the force tamper but refused to spend 200 dollars on such a tool, I decided to pull the trigger and have this be my new tamper. I have seen zero reviews on this thing no one has really mentioned it, and there are not videos online except from the company itself. It also isn‚Äôt even on Amazon yet so I have decided to put a little review here for anyone who is thinking about getting one. 

The tamper arrives in a box with just itself and a little rubber stand for it to sit in when not in use. It seems very well made, there are no manufacturing issues and the build is sturdy. In use, the impact mechanism is easy to actuate and does a really good job compressing the coffee grounds. The impact is actually pretty intense, when I first received the tamper I pressed it into my hand and was shocked at how hard it hit back at me. It‚Äôs not overly loud but does have a good bang to it. 

I am not a huge fan of the ripple base, but it also hasn‚Äôt caused me any real issues. Grounds don‚Äôt really seem to stick to it much, but I really don‚Äôt see the point of it except just to look cool. One issue people talk about with the force tamper is that because of the impact, grounds find its way between the leveling collar and the tamping plate. This is an issue with this tamper as well, after a few uses there are a considerable amount of grounds that get trapped in here. You can‚Äôt see them unless you pull the collar back. It‚Äôs really easy to clean however because of how easy it is to pull that leveling collar back, you can just blow them away or brush them and it‚Äôs good as new. 

My wife loves this tamper. It‚Äôs impossible to tamp uneven and the light actuation of the impact spring means she doesn‚Äôt have to try very hard to compress the grounds. 

The looks of the tamper are kind of hit or miss. I think the tamper looks really good, and its ergonomically comfortable. The logo on top I think is a nice touch but I would prefer it to just be embossed and kept black. However I hate the white lettering around the leveling collar of the tamper. I don‚Äôt know why MHW insist on putting letters, branding, and words all over their accessories. ‚ÄúSince 2019‚Äù is not very impressive as far as company history so I‚Äôm unsure why they feel the need to print this on the product, along with everything else. Some of their newer products I feel like they are starting to get the design and branding down, but they are obviously still struggling in that department. 

I really like the products from this company so far, I have a couple accessories from them and they are seemingly well made and useful. 

Overall I am very happy with the purchase. It has eased my desire to purchase some overpriced tamper just for the gimmick of an ‚Äúimpact‚Äù. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs just a way to squish coffee into a smaller area in order to brew it, most every tamper will offer the same result but I do find this one to be pretty cool.

I was diagnosed last year with Narcolepsy with Cataplexy. I was on a PPO at the time and got started immediately on Xywav. After a very intense adjustment period, it reeeeeally worked for me. It treated both the daytime sleepiness and the cataplexy. I felt more human than I have in a long time. Unfortunately, the adjustment period (anxiety/panic, weight loss then hair loss, etc.) was so rough that I had to take a medical leave of absence from work and was subsequently laid off in September. So it goes...

  
In January of this year, I was still looking for work so I got kicked from my marketplace insurance to Medicaid. My previous doctor put in a prior authorization for Xywav, which was immediately denied, but she never followed up with an appeal and ended up leaving her practice in March. Xywav put me on their Bridge program, which lasted until mid-May, at which point I ended up unmedicated. It took me ages to find a new doctor... Apparently, there are literally NO sleep doctors or neurologists in my medicaid network, so after 9 failed referrals over the course of 4/5 months, I just found a doctor and paid out of pocket in June. 

  
This new doctor put in a second prior authorization for Xywav for me, and one for Modafinil, both of which were denied on the basis that provider ""did not include information why commonly used drug, available on the [Medi-cal list](https://medi-calrx.dhcs.ca.gov/cms/medicalrx/static-assets/documents/provider/forms-and-information/cdl/Medi-Cal_Rx_Contract_Drugs_List_FINAL.pdf), are not adequate for medical needs."" Well, I would have thought Modafinil was the most common and most affordable, but it's not on the list. I actually cannot find ANY narcolepsy drugs on the list, and no one at Medi-cal RX can tell me what I should have tried before they approve either Modafinil or Xywav, because they ""are not medical professionals.""

  
My doctor has since put in two appeals for Xywav, both of which Medi-cal RX claims they did not receive, and one more prior authorization, which includes information that I have tried both Adderall and Modafinil‚Äîagain denied for the same reason as previous denial. I know I can most likely get Jazz to cover me on the patient assistance program, but this would require Medi-cal to actually acknowledge and deny an appeal. I really feel like I am being fucked with. 

  
Meanwhile, I am not functioning well‚Äî200 mg of Modafinil allows me to sort of wake up, but even with multiple cups of coffee, I can't make it through the day without at least 3 naps / sleep attacks, and the cataplexy is back with a real vengeance. I'd really love to find a job and get off of Medi-cal ASAP, but of course, that's exponentially more difficult when I can't even make it through lunch without falling asleep.

I'm at my wit's end! Any advice for dealing with Medicaid / Medi-cal RX re: Xywav or other N meds would be so deeply appreciated. I cannot figure this out. ",1,1753825451.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False
1mcoitn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Europetravel/comments/1mcoitn/trip_report_romania_timisoara_banat_countryside/,"Trip Report: Romania (Timisoara, Banat Countryside, Sibiu, Sighisoara, Viscri, Brasov, Transfagarasan, Bucharest)","Hey everyone,

I just returned from two weeks in Romania and want to post somewhere about it besides my personal travel blog/IG page where it will actually reach people...

I went to Romania with two friends for two weeks and we had an unbelievable time. The scenery throughout Transylvania was amazing. The people were incredibly hospitable, curious, and outgoing. The beer and wine was great. The cities (Timisoara, Sibiu, and Brasov in particular) were stunning and really good vibes. The countryside (Viscri, Sighisoara, rural farmland in Western Romania) was peaceful.

Here was our itinerary:

\*Day 1-4 - Timisoara: Eased into the trip by taking it easy without much on the agenda for three full days. We loved Timisoara. The three main squares were legitimately three of the coolest I've ever seen. Pedestrian-only historical center was a breath of fresh air as an American. The amount of great coffee shops was insane. Narativ, Acas, Brewno, Ovride were a few top ones in particular. Neata Omelette was great for brunch, and Brewers Garden was really fun for a night out for live music in a beer garden setting (outside of historical center). The Drunken Rat had good pub vibes with friendly service. The most hospitable people we came across in Romania was in Timisoara. All the parks, green space, and walking + cycling trails along the Bega River were great. If you want to stay on the go, you only need two days here, but it was nice to get a good chunk of time here given we were fighting jet lag for 36 hours. We filled time by doing a street food tour, and by renting bikes and taking them to the countryside along the Bega to La Livada by Nora, an outdoor buffet-style restaurant. Really cool vibes.

\*Day 4/5 - Banat Countryside Day Trip: Private guided day trip to the properties of three women. One traditional farmer with animals/fruits/vegetables, one woman's rose farm for rose donuts and rose lemonade, and one woman's home where she cooked us a grand Romanian meal for lunch. Highly recommend this. On the way to our next stop (Sibiu) we stopped at Corvin's / Hunedoara Castle. Enjoyed it, but quite a lot of people. I've heard Bran and Peles Castles can get even more crowded, so I'd recommend going in the morning or right before it closes.

\*Day 5-6 - Sibiu: Some of the most picturesque medieval settings I've come across. Saint Mary's Evangelical Cathedral in particular was gorgeous. Views for days. ART Hotel was a perfect boutique hotel. SPIC Paste si Vin was our favorite meal of the trip, partially because of the view of the cathedral sitting outside. Storybook setting. Fantastic brunch at Lumos. The main park (Sub Arini Park) on the south side of the city was also wonderful for running and scootering around. Great trails. Two full days here feels perfect.

\*Day 7-9 - Transfagarasan (1-night Air BnB stay in mountains) + Viscri (2-night guesthouse stay) + Sighisoara half day trip: The Transfagarasan was as advertised. We hiked from Balea Lake up to the peak overlooking the lake, with Capra Lake in the valley beneath on the other side. When we reached the top we got caught in a hailstorm which kind of sucked but was also memorable. We hunkered down on the shores of Capra Lake before finishing the hike on the other side of the ridge. Setting looked like Scotland/Iceland up there in the mountains. Did a full day mountain biking ride throughout the countryside around Viscri which was wonderful. Explored the Viscri Fortified Church before leaving town, which we actually liked more than Corvin Castle. Stopped by Sighisoara on the way to Brasov. The Clock Tower was really beautiful. Perfect for a half-day trip -- didn't feel like we missed anything.

\*Day 10-13 - Brasov: Was really nice to have three full days here. We hiked Mount Tampa to the famous Brasov sign. We did the Seven Ladders Canyon hike, which is great for anyone in decent shape. Went out a couple nights to O'Peter's Irish Pub which was great for post-dinner dancing and karaoke, and then Times which was a solid nightclub for dancing into the early hours. Aftar Stube was a fantastic beer garden here that you shouldn't miss. Best beer in Brasov. Ch9 Specialty Coffee right underneath the Black Church is also a must for your morning coffee. Walk to the top of White Tower (Turnul Alb) and Black Tower (Turnul Negru) for best views of the city. We stayed at Vila Katherina Boutique Hotel which was 10/10. Massive rooms, great location, friendly hosts. You can do Brasov in two full days, but I think three is required to do a couple of the fun adventure stuff outside of immediate city center (Poiana Brasov, Brasov Adventure Park, Seven Ladders Canyon Hike).

\*Day 13-14 - Bucharest: Probably could've spent another day or two here, but only had so much time and we prefer the smaller cities. If you're into history and architecture, definitely give Bucharest more than 1 full day like I did. A gritty city that felt a bit chaotic, but I didn't necessarily hate that. Venture outside of the old town, lots of tourist trap bars and restaurants there. But in the old town definitely go to the Communist Museum. It's only three rooms and takes about one hour to experience but you'll learn a lot. Some of the architecture in Bucharest was SO cool coming from someone who isn't the biggest architecture nerd. 

Overall: One of my favorite countries I've been to. The scenery, the people, the variety of food, the cafes, the culture... the list goes on. Great mix of cities and countryside worth exploring. I have endless content to post on my travel pages. I still want to go to places like Oradea, Danube Gorge, Cluj, and Retezat National Park.

For the first two years we had a regular sex life.  We got married and 6 months in,  it all stopped.  We found out she had what we thought was a tumor in her brain.  It took like a year but we found out it was a growth,  not cancer.  But we can't have kids or she'll likely go blind because it's grown on/ through her optic nerves. 

So sex became kinda scary.  She didn't wanna be on bc, cause it can cause weight gain.  She didn't feel comfy with condoms because they can fail.  So we stayed non sexual. We both got depressed because we wanted to have kids. 

We has the conversation about vasectomy.  She said she wanted to be physical, and this is what would make her comfortable.  I asked repeatedly if she was sure.  She said yes. 

3 months ago,  I got it done.  I have the test results and I'm now sterile.  When I found out, I took her out for lunch,  we did a date like the old days.  Coffee and book shopping,  and when I tried to be physical I got fully rejected.  I tried again the next day and got asked why I'm being so impatient. 

We had a conversation and she said she's just not ready and needs more time and I need to not be impatient. 

I've waited and been patient for 4 years.  I didn't complain,  i was understanding.  I got sterilized for us.  And yet I'm still ""impatient"" she "" needs more time"".  

I don't want to pressure her.  I thought she would be excited for the clear result too. Should I just stop trying? After all this,  it's getting harder and harder to get rejected. I love my wife and I'm sure she loves me too.  We both wanted kids. And I'm ok with not having kids,  it's rather have my wife,  but damn I miss being physically close to her.  Should I just be more patient?  wait for her to make a move? Just quit trying to make it happen altogether?

Thank you for coming to me. For asking me to go for a drive to get me coffee ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π and sharing about the pathway you found forward in your educational plans‚Ä¶ I really am so happy you found something that aligns with the way you‚Äôd like to see that accomplished. It‚Äôs one of the things I admire & delight in about you. You know this but I‚Äôm reflecting & want to share the thoughts. Take a chance‚Ä¶.. that well, I‚Äôm taking the chance to make a change.

- Your lifetime commitment to learning and gaining that academic achievement you‚Äôve always had set for yourself- I simply cherish it. It always brings w/it those feelings of innocent and unabashed idealism I had seen you with when we were in school- it has its whole own mental picture: you coming down the hall toward my locker blonde messy curly hair shining to match your bright eyes trained right on me, books in hand, light of step- and that smile- Oh baby that smile. You were (& still are) a god damn smoke show. And me just standing there holding the floor down feeling goofy, smitten, & just dying to be any and everything you‚Äôd be proud of. *Specifically - this mental picture is from that report card day I was so excited to show you. I‚Äôd shocked myself by how drastically I‚Äôd brought up my grades. The sparkle in your eyes and the flush of your cheeks told me just how proud you really were. And that was THAT. Bubby. I knew forEVER all I wanted to do was believe in and be everything you told me I already was (and I knew. You were just the first person in my life to actually hold me accountable to that) to love me. Others might see that as demeaning to my family- but you know. You KNOW. And that has made it so tough on us too. Oh, the attachment I have to you in the birthplace of that love & giving you my innocence. It‚Äôs irrevocable. I‚Äôve expressed this- in this presence it‚Äôs *powerful* (that‚Äôs a reflection for later)

That‚Äôs exactly who we were to one another- best friends that never held back much. We were a handful and then some for the world and one another, yet we thrived and cultivated that dynamic & passion for pushing ourselves and one another. We‚Äôd mapped out goals that spanned years ahead of us. Something we frankly were better at then than we are now. But Life was very VERY real for us- this we know, those plans kept us vibrant. Thirsty for life and one another‚Ä¶. But my point here is‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs still exactly who we are. 

We do not hold back on one another. Not even a little. In fact, we‚Äôre exacting of one another; we simply lost our ability to see with the eyes of our 16/17 yr old selves. We could hold space for such complexity and yet still believe and trust in the intentions of one another even when our shit behavior indicated otherwise. I‚Äôm certain that had a whole lot to do with the impact and behavior of those around us we didn‚Äôt have any say in, bc even now- neither one of us is truly given to ‚Äúacting out‚Äù. The stark truth is, we‚Äôre extraordinarily intentional people and we make moves for maximum impact. Straight up. The biggest difference between then & now. Then: our greatest priority was protecting one another, it was our present and active intention bc the world around us was more than unkind; it was malicious, jealous, & intended to sever our bond. We knew and understood that reality & did all 2 kids could to navigate something that should never have happened to us.
Now- we both seem to be far too comfortable with one another‚Äôs discomfort. We seem to only capitulate to that notion of protecting and guarding one another in the chaos we conjured in the way we began & broke. It‚Äôs there‚Ä¶ somewhere under all the ego and pride.

We alluded to it now, but our pride dictates we hold the line doesn‚Äôt it??? Right is right- wrong is wrong and since we‚Äôre big boys and girls we should have it figured out. That‚Äôs the undeniable belief we operate under, we can ‚Äúsay‚Äù oh mistakes is what it takes to learn a thing and blah blah blah. But when the pain, anxiety, & discomfort of being messy, mentally ill, & intellectually exceptional all hit‚Ä¶.. the gloves are off. We do not suffer fools and neither of us are very kind to performative behavior. It triggers some disgust and yet, we persist & participate. 

It was SO good to hear you speak on that. The perpetuation of participation. I love how organically that conversation took shape. I love even more how real that felt. 

Well‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve run out of steam. I really took more time on writing this one out. 
It feels‚Ä¶. Like bliss to speak from a place of alignment & authenticity. For me- Even though I‚Äôm fighting that resistance & externalized pride‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt be that character anymore. It‚Äôs abrasive to my heart, to my mind, to my spirit. The God within me balks at such dishonor for my husband ‚Ä¶. No matter your personal choices darling, more and more I see the toll that that filling that role just to keep a guard on the intensity of fear that washes over me at times. - the fear that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
You don‚Äôt want me anymore.

Not that I‚Äôm not the only one. I‚Äôve never needed that. I just don‚Äôt. I never have. I know me and my heart. I know just how much love and presence the human heart is capable of holding. You loving and desiring and being fulfilled by another person who brings you joy delights me babe. And I get it. A whole lot of people feel contempt for that kind of thing. I however am completely comfortable that I am that way. It fully grinds my wheeze for you to indulge your joy. ü•π As it SHOULD. I think it‚Äôs fucking weird that people only feel loved by being a chosen exception‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs ok, I do not judge anyone for the shapes and forms their desires& love takes. We‚Äôre all dynamic and ever changing beings on a journey.

That fear is valid bubby- when you‚Äôre done loving, longing, & feeling seen by your loves‚Ä¶ you quit them quietly. Recast their roll far In advance & set to methodically pushing them out of your life. 
- it‚Äôs the silence of it I fear. Not the possibility or eventuality. I of all people know that tomorrow isn‚Äôt promised. Life can change in an instant. Befores stack up as we move along & sometimes we make the mistake of looking a little too long at before and romanticizing its ease while forgetting the moment that changed it all. Those moments are for refinement. Refinement makes the After precious. Understood. And ultimately far more vibrant to exist in. 

Those who have known extraordinary suffering understand the fullness joy. 
Those who have buried loves cleaved from their very chest understand HOW to BE HELD.
Those who have fought their way out of the depths of trauma understand the Devine privilege of being Present. 

With that I‚Äôll close. Because we have today. We have this time and space in our home. We have tender if not timid kisses to exchange. Hands to hold. And one another‚Äôs company to keep. üåπ

1mcodlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhrolovaMains/comments/1mcodlx/my_thoughts_about_rovers_side_of_the_promise/,My thoughts about Rover's side of the 'promise',"First off I wanna start by saying this is mostly a response post for some of the defense points I've seen going around for Rover in this plotpoint of the quest dynamic. While I can see the vision for some of the arguments, I also think they don't do a good job of making thematic sense. I think it is pretty essential that we accept Rover made a mistake along the way in how the interaction at the concert went.

To begin, Rover says they will return no matter what when the piece is completed, and also nods and acknowledges Phrolova when she says she will save a VIP seat for them next time (obviously referring to a concert in the future, not a Sonoro Sphere that has not even been thought up yet). Even so, the core of my reasoning is not just because of what the promise is specifically, but because of the way Rover emphasised and really weighed in the significance of a promise to them. That's not something you do unless you really intend on following it up and being there for the other person, which Rover absolutely did not do in any capacity. People are, imo, making a set of mistakes of making the Rover in their heads inconsistent just by trying to defend them. I saw someone comment this elsewhere but they said something along the lines of if you went to a barista and told them the coffee they made is amazing. Then the barista expressed it could be better and you say ""I'll definitely come back to try it when it's perfected"", you're never going to be saying this assuming it is a different version of yourself in some time in the future so distant from the current moment you're making that promise in, no matter how technical you would want to get with the words ""perfect"" or ""complete"". Because in actuality there isn't a means to figure out whether something is truly perfected or not. The meaning the word perfect has is when the creator gives it some. Wording a promise like that implies you will engage with the work/creation to some capacity to follow along and see when the time comes where the artist views it as fully worth presenting. Which, according to Phrolova's notes, she may have thought as much in just a few concerts after that one, where I assume she had tirelessly been working on improving the piece. The story introduced the potential for criticism or greyness involving Rover, not just a white sheet of perfect morality, and I think a failed promise ties in quite appropriately with that. 

Otherwise, not only you'd be suggesting that Rover is omniscient about when Phrolova would have her piece completed, but you'd also be asserting that Rover just because they were a god-like being who roamed the world and was very different from regular people didn't understand humans at all, which is far from the truth. Those levels of experience may have detached them from the regular person, but that amount of time roving the world and developing enough actual personal care and motivation to save the world means Rover knows very well what things mean to people and the significance of individuals' mental states and experiences they have. Rover in the past is many times stated to be wise by other characters we've seen not just logically but emotionally too. Rover would not have made this promise and emphasised the gravity of it like they did to a musician whom they can clearly see is haunted by something in her past, and looking for inspiration if they never intended to show up at any reasonable point. 

The ""Rover assumed they would meet Phrolova at some point no matter what because they're both immortal"" argument makes no sense to me either because they didn't know Phrolova was immortal, nor can they ever be sure she would survive at that point for the meeting to happen again. It feels like mental gymnastics to go through just to claim that Rover fulfilled the promise exactly how they always had planned. The story itself goes through great effort to nail in the fact that current Rover is bewildered/caught in the crossfire of this failed promise, that meant a lot to Phrolova, and would've done a lot too for the path she would've taken if it was properly met. As for Rover questioning whether the interaction was real, I think it's laid out pretty plainly that the priority of why they didn't believe it at first is cause of uncertainty in how much they can trust Phrolova and events involving her, rather than anything else. 

I don't like the concept of the argument either not just because rationally it doesn't click but because emotionally it downgrades the narrative that 2.5 has generated. It downgrades Phrolova's struggle to just 'delusional girl who thought she was more important than she was', which is going against the moral and chronological complexity in it. It downgrades the precedent it sets that Rover is very important in the story so some decisions/statements they make can go absolutely wrong and not just right, something we haven't seen before in this game. It conveys the ""Rover can promise this, but Rover is facing off against a world ending threat, and something can happen that forces them to wipe their memory or be unavailable to those lives they touched even in a single conversation"" idea strongly. It shows the importance of being careful with the influence you have, no matter how brief the interaction was. This plot thread also aligns with the consequences in the actual quest itself that are faced and not just in the past. You guys can tell me your own thoughts on this but I think trying to absolve Rover of any guilt involving the promise, which are themselves shaky points from what I've seen, is depleting some inherent aspects of the second breaking point that Phrolova endures, and takes away from the setup this creates for exploring the darker side of ties to Rover throughout their history.",2,1753825102.0,PhrolovaMains,2,1.0,False

There‚Äôs this guy‚ÄîV. We worked together, and we got really close over time. We saw each other **every single day**‚Äîduring and after work. We‚Äôd go shopping, sit for coffee, talk for hours. He‚Äôd **walk me home almost every night**, and even **call me at 6 AM** to make sure I woke up for my shifts. It felt like something real was growing between us‚Ä¶ something gentle and good. I felt **safe** with him, and for me, that‚Äôs huge.

I was **sexually assaulted** in the past, and ever since, I‚Äôve struggled to feel safe around men. Most of them only see me for my body. I‚Äôm short‚Äî5ft‚Äîwith a C cup, hourglass figure, green eyes, long black hair, and clear skin. No matter how I act or dress, men tend to approach me only for sex or make inappropriate comments, even when I give no signals.

But he‚Ä¶ he was different. He made me feel like a **girl who could be loved**, not used. I really started to believe in us.

Then I went to a rave. I‚Äôm also a DJ, and music is a part of who I am. He‚Äôs Muslim and very committed to his faith. Two days after the rave, he texted me saying that **we‚Äôre not for each other**‚Äîthat I like raves and he goes to pray.  
It hurt.

But I told him I **wanted to change my ways** for him. That I was confused and scared because I didn‚Äôt know if he was the right person‚Äîbut I still cared deeply. He offered to meet and talk about everything.  
And I said **no**. I told him, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not right for each other,‚Äù even though it broke my heart. I regret that now more than anything.

Today, we finally talked a little. And just **looking at him** made my heart race. He looked so beautiful, familiar, kind‚Ä¶ and it hit me all over again. I still feel something strong. And I swear, when I looked at him, I saw it in his eyes too. I really think we‚Äôd be good for each other if we just gave it a real chance.

I want to message him again. I want to tell him that I still care, that I want to try. But I‚Äôm scared.  
What if he never really liked me?  
But then again‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs against his faith to lie, and I **don‚Äôt think he was faking**.  
It just *felt* too genuine.

I‚Äôm not being dramatic‚ÄîI swear, I don‚Äôt want anyone else. I don‚Äôt want anyone touching me or speaking to me the way most men do. I don‚Äôt want to go back to meaningless interactions. I just want that peace again. That safety. ",1,1753825073.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1mcobgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1mcobgi/is_fitbit_calories_out_tracking_accurate/,Is Fitbit calories out tracking accurate?,"Hi all

Just wondering about Fitbit and whether its calories spent reading is accurate. I'm trying to log my intake as precisely as possible, and whilst this is difficult to do when someone else cooked, or when no scales are on hand, I try err toward an overestimate to be safe. I count everything down to the dash of milk in my coffee or clove of garlic in the marinara.

For context I'm BMI 28-29 ish, have a chronic disease that prevents most exercise and active lifestyle and I'm trying to get fit by walking and doing some home workout when I can, BPM hardly ever exceeds 120bpm. I used to do a lot in the past and still retain some muscle, mostly lower body. I'm on propranolol which acts like a hand brake on exercise and consume high salt/electrolytes to help with some of the symptoms, which probably causes water retention.

I've been on a work stint for a couple of weeks which sent my tdee spiking according to Fitbit. From about 1800 to 2400 last week. Getting 10k steps without trying (vs 2400). Appetite's been shit so I average about 1700 in, which is similar to my non work days. On ordinary passive days, I'm Bout 100 in the negatives but don't notice any weight loss, and find it hard to pusg the intake lower at those numbers. Any less than 1700 a day and I'm miserable.

So now that the gap is bigger, I should expect to see noticeable progress in the coming 1-2 weeks. If I maintain a deficit of 750 then I should lose about 2.8 kg per month, right? Can the medication which suppresses the heart rate interfere with the accuracy of the Fitbit logging?

I read a lot of reviews and complaints about Muslim dating apps and just felt like sharing my 2 cents. I'm a white/Arab 30 F phd student in the US for context. I've been on Muzz, Salams, Coffe meets Bagel (not made for Muslims but there is a filter that only shows you Muslims) and recently tried inpairs. Out of all of them I think inpairs was my favourite. I had matches in all three waves during this drop season. I had no luck but I have to say I liked it very much. The fact that it's a real muslim person matching you to someone is very reassuring. The matches I was offered were not perfect but also not terrible and I liked 2/3 but they did not reciprocate. I had a promo code from my masjid and thought to try it out. It's on the pricier end but it's definitely worth the try. I will not be using it again for the time being, but if one day I decide to go back to using apps I would probably choose inpairs. 
As for the others, swiping was very overwhelming and most often you find folks who practice differently or not at all. I do have to say that coffee meets Bagel does not put you under the same stress as you can only swipe on a certain number of people per time and once you match with someone it gives you the chance to focus on developing a connection with them.
I did meet a few men from the apps but none had serious intentions unfortunately. I have to say though that I do love the diversity offered and the chance to learn more about other cultures, but I already took history and geography in school so yeah. One thing I would say, if you know your family will not accept a woman from another ethnicity just let it go. Do not initiate a conversation as it is only going to end up in hurt! I think being clear from the start and having a good neya is essential. Respect yourselves and others ya akhwanna!

* **Financial Readiness Planner:** Simple tools to help you feel in control, like a baby budget calculator and a checklist for financial tasks (e.g., ""update insurance,"" ""look into 529 plans"").
* **Curated Product Recommendations:** A non-overwhelming, trusted list of essential products to help you decide what to buy.
* **A Simple Community Forum:** A space to connect with other moms who have the same due date month.
* **Local Mom Meetups:** A feature to help you easily find and connect with other new moms in your area for park walks, coffee, etc.
* **A Small Expert-Written Library:** A handful of high-quality articles on key topics (including finance) without the usual clutter and ads.

I would be so grateful for your honest feedback:

1. What's the single biggest thing that has stressed you out or overwhelmed you during pregnancy or as a new mom?
2. Looking at the list, which features seem **most valuable**? Which seem **least valuable**?
3. How important is the **financial planning** aspect to you? Is that something you'd want in an app like this?
4. Most apps are free but full of ads. Would you be willing to pay a small monthly subscription (like a cup of coffee) for a premium, ad-free app that had all of this?

Thank you so much for your time and insights!",2,1753824908.0,firsttimemom,0,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match that‚Äôs as chaotic as a toddler‚Äôs art class: Nottingham Forest, fresh off a **preseason loss to Fulham** (a team that‚Äôs basically the ‚Äúalso-rans‚Äù of the Championship), squares off against Estoril, a Portuguese side with the audacious goal of securing European competition spots. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a sports bar after a 3 AM beer.

---

### Parse the Odds: Implied Probabilities and Preseason Shenanigans

The only odds we‚Äôve got are for a *different* match entirely (CF Estrela vs. Estoril on August 11), but let‚Äôs extrapolate! For that game, Estoril is favored at **2.2 decimal odds** (implied probability: \~45.45%), while CF Estrela sits at 3.1 (\~32.26%). Though not directly relevant, this suggests Estoril is the stronger team in their domestic context. Translating that to this friendly? Let‚Äôs assume Estoril enters this match with the confidence of a man who just won a free coffee, while Nottingham Forest is still figuring out how to load their new signings into the starting XI.

Key stats:

* **Nottingham Forest**: Integrated newbies like Jair Cunha and Igor Jesus, but lost their first preseason match to Fulham. Their defense? A sieve that would make a leaky umbrella proud.
* **Estoril**: Preparing for a competitive season, with coach Ian Cathro tweaking formations like a mad scientist with a clipboard. Their focus on European qualification means they‚Äôre playing with the urgency of someone who‚Äôs *finally* found a parking spot near the stadium.

I usually work full-time in backend roles, but on nights and weekends, I built an iOS app called **SupaCards** to solve a simple but real problem I personally had.

Here‚Äôs the story.

My wife and I have dozens of loyalty, membership, and reward cards and for a long time, we just stored them as photos in our iPhone gallery. But once you have more than a handful, scrolling through a messy photo album at checkout becomes a pain.

As a developer, I naturally wanted to build something myself. It started from a simple idea: an app where I could add a card in a few taps, even one tap, then open the app, find the card quickly, and display its barcode or QR code. No login, no clutter.

So back in May, I started and in mid-June, I released the first version of **SupaCards** (was named Locards). It was super minimal. But I got some great feedback from Reddit (thank you!), and it helped shape the app‚Äôs direction. Since then, I‚Äôve added:

* **Widgets** for quick access from your home screen
* **Spotlight search** so you can find cards without opening the app
* **Card categories**
* **Custom designs and colors**
* **Optional ad removal via IAP**

Yes, I added banner ads. As a solo developer doing this in my own time, I need a bit of motivation to keep going.

Of course, **every feature in the app is free**, and **ads can be removed for the price of a coffee - $3.99**. No subscriptions!

To be honest, while building SupaCards, I learned more about the loyalty card app space than I ever expected. One of the biggest players, Stocard, which many users relied on for years, was acquired by Klarna, and recently, it shut down completely. Many users were forced to migrate, and not everyone was happy about it.

For users looking for a lightweight Stocard alternative, or a no-frills store card manager and digital passbook that just works, **SupaCards** is my take on what that should look like: clean, practical, and designed by someone who actually needed it.

I‚Äôm continuing to improve it, one feature at a time, and I‚Äôd love to hear from real users to shape where it goes next.

Thanks for reading. I'd love to hear any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, appreciated!

1mco6v9,https://i.redd.it/7iuw9jq4tvff1.png,[Browser game][2000s~2010s] No goal no points no death pet care game,"Hi everyone, how are you ?
I've been looking for this game for a while now, and I still can't find it, so I thought asking for help for once might prove itself useful.

(repost because my text got wiped out I didn't notice changing to an ""Images"" type of post did that)

---

Platform: PC (windows), browser (I used Firefox)

Genre: Pet care, third person (I don't think you could see yourself/human. There was only the pet)

Language: Probably English

Estimated year of release: 2000~2010

Graphics/art style: 2d, cozy, cartoonish like those books for children (Pierre Lapin style), I have a fuzzy memory of the lineart, so maybe the lineart was very thin.
The colour palette was muted and brownish. Kind of like coffee and dried tea leaves or flowers (autumnish cozy cottage kind of palette ?)

Areas: The game is 2D and happens in a single floor house.
You can change the rooms you're watching (kind of like a camera system) by clicking on the right or the left of the room.
In order, from left to right:
- Garden (green grass, white fences and a bird bath. I think you can interact with a bird there. The sky is pale blue. There are probably toys on the ground.)
- Kitchen (the pet food & water bowl is on the floor, bottom right of the screen....or was it in the living room.... Main colours of the kitchen are white/beige and a bit of black/brown)
- Living room (mainly reddish warm coloured walls and furnitures)
- Bathroom (doubt)

Notable characters: The pet (you receive a prompt that looks like a letter ‚úâÔ∏è as soon as you start the game. The background colour of the pop up window/prompt is either light (whitish, maybe beige) or transparent (in that case, the background is blurred, it is either the kitchen or the living room). You then have to pick a pet among two categories: dog or cat.
If I remember correctly, each category has two different races of the corresponding species. One of the cats had black fur with a bit of white. One of the dogs had beige fur.
The running pace of both species were about the same (a ""chill human walk"" pace --> the pet's paw movements are much slower than its real life versions (think about the kind of floaty run the metallic horse of the latest Olympic games in Paris)).
The pet could run through a single room in about 10 seconds.

Notable gameplay mechanics:
You can feed the pet biscuits (as treats) üç™ üç™ üç™ very satisfying
You hear the crunch and see the biscuit disappear into your pet's mouth bit by bit

There's also your usual dog/cat bowl food (some kind of brown stuff that's either croquettes or shredded meat) and water.

You can feed it or not feed it as much and many times as you like (the pet is immune to death and diseases, is never hungry and is never full).

You can play with your cat with a fishing rod you can move with your cursor (the physics of the string are amazing). The game stops when the cat catches it.

If you have a dog, you can throw a frisbee. It will run and jump to catch it.

There's also probably a tennis ball somewhere.

The dog barks often but it's pretty well-paced (barks and bark pacing are similar to those of the wolfdogs in Minecraft).
I think the cat does the same (no it doesn't bark, it meows).

Other details: I used to play this game between 2012 and 2015.
I'm French. Always lived in France. I don't know if the game was a flash game, but I used to play flash games a lot.
Other games I played around that time were TriAchnid and Jadewolf.

1mco2z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1mco2z1/the_perpetuation_of_participation/,The Perpetuation of Participation,"Thank you Christopher Robin

Thank you for coming to me. For asking me to go for a drive to get me coffee and sharing about the pathway you found forward in your educational plans‚Ä¶ I really am so happy you found something that aligns with the way you‚Äôd like to see that accomplished. It‚Äôs one of the things I admire & delight in about you. You know this but I‚Äôm reflecting & want to share the thoughts. Take a chance‚Ä¶.. that well, I‚Äôm taking the chance to make a change.

- Your lifetime commitment to learning and gaining that academic achievement you‚Äôve always had set for yourself- I simply cherish it. It always brings w/it those feelings of innocent and unabashed idealism I had seen you with when we were in school- it has its whole own mental picture: you coming down the hall toward my locker blonde messy curly hair shining to match your bright eyes trained right on me, books in hand, light of step- and that smile- Oh baby that smile. You were (& still are) a god damn smoke show. And me just standing there holding the floor down feeling goofy, smitten, & just dying to be any and everything you‚Äôd be proud of. *Specifically - this mental picture is from that report card day I was so excited to show you. I‚Äôd shocked myself by how drastically I‚Äôd brought up my grades. The sparkle in your eyes and the flush of your cheeks told me just how proud you really were. And that was THAT. Bubby. I knew forEVER all I wanted to do was believe in and be everything you told me I already was (and I knew. You were just the first person in my life to actually hold me accountable to that) to love me. Others might see that as demeaning to my family- but you know. You KNOW. And that has made it so tough on us too. Oh, the attachment I have to you in the birthplace of that love & giving you my innocence. It‚Äôs irrevocable. I‚Äôve expressed this- in this presence it‚Äôs *powerful* (that‚Äôs a reflection for later)

That‚Äôs exactly who we were to one another- best friends that never held back much. We were a handful and then some for the world and one another, yet we thrived and cultivated that dynamic & passion for pushing ourselves and one another. We‚Äôd mapped out goals that spanned years ahead of us. Something we frankly were better at then than we are now. But Life was very VERY real for us- this we know, those plans kept us vibrant. Thirsty for life and one another‚Ä¶. But my point here is‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs still exactly who we are. 

We do not hold back on one another. Not even a little. In fact, we‚Äôre exacting of one another; we simply lost our ability to see with the eyes of our 16/17 yr old selves. We could hold space for such complexity and yet still believe and trust in the intentions of one another even when our shit behavior indicated otherwise. I‚Äôm certain that had a whole lot to do with the impact and behavior of those around us we didn‚Äôt have any say in, bc even now- neither one of us is truly given to ‚Äúacting out‚Äù. The stark truth is, we‚Äôre extraordinarily intentional people and we make moves for maximum impact. Straight up. The biggest difference between then & now. Then: our greatest priority was protecting one another, it was our present and active intention bc the world around us was more than unkind; it was malicious, jealous, & intended to sever our bond. We knew and understood that reality & did all 2 kids could to navigate something that should never have happened to us.
Now- we both seem to be far too comfortable with one another‚Äôs discomfort. We seem to only capitulate to that notion of protecting and guarding one another in the chaos we conjured in the way we began & broke. It‚Äôs there‚Ä¶ somewhere under all the ego and pride.

We alluded to it now, but our pride dictates we hold the line doesn‚Äôt it??? Right is right- wrong is wrong and since we‚Äôre big boys and girls we should have it figured out. That‚Äôs the undeniable belief we operate under, we can ‚Äúsay‚Äù oh mistakes is what it takes to learn a thing and blah blah blah. But when the pain, anxiety, & discomfort of being messy, mentally ill, & intellectually exceptional all hit‚Ä¶.. the gloves are off. We do not suffer fools and neither of us are very kind to performative behavior. It triggers some disgust and yet, we persist & participate. 

It was SO good to hear you speak on that. The perpetuation of participation. I love how organically that conversation took shape. I love even more how real that felt. 

Well‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve run out of steam. I really took more time on writing this one out. 
It feels‚Ä¶. Like bliss to speak from a place of alignment & authenticity. For me- Even though I‚Äôm fighting that resistance & externalized pride‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt be that character anymore. It‚Äôs abrasive to my heart, to my mind, to my spirit. The God within me balks at such dishonor for my husband ‚Ä¶. No matter your personal choices darling, more and more I see the toll that that filling that role just to keep a guard on the intensity of fear that washes over me at times. - the fear that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
You don‚Äôt want me anymore.

Not that I‚Äôm not the only one. I‚Äôve never needed that. I just don‚Äôt. I never have. I know me and my heart. I know just how much love and presence the human heart is capable of holding. You loving and desiring and being fulfilled by another person who brings you joy delights me babe. And I get it. A whole lot of people feel contempt for that kind of thing. I however am completely comfortable that I am that way. It fully grinds my wheeze for you to indulge your joy. As it SHOULD. I think it‚Äôs fucking weird that people only feel loved by being a chosen exception‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs ok, I do not judge anyone for the shapes and forms their desires& love takes. We‚Äôre all dynamic and ever changing beings on a journey.

That fear is valid bubby- when you‚Äôre done loving, longing, & feeling seen by your loves‚Ä¶ you quit them quietly. Recast their roll far In advance & set to methodically pushing them out of your life. 
- it‚Äôs the silence of it I fear. Not the possibility or eventuality. I of all people know that tomorrow isn‚Äôt promised. Life can change in an instant. Befores stack up as we move along & sometimes we make the mistake of looking a little too long at before and romanticizing its ease while forgetting the moment that changed it all. Those moments are for refinement. Refinement makes the After precious. Understood. And ultimately far more vibrant to exist in. 

Those who have known extraordinary suffering understand the fullness joy. 
Those who have buried loves cleaved from their very chest understand HOW to BE HELD.
Those who have fought their way out of the depths of trauma understand the Devine privilege of being Present. 

With that I‚Äôll close. Because we have today. We have this time and space in our home. We have tender if not timid kisses to exchange. Hands to hold. And one another‚Äôs company to keep.

## Key Features Analysis

This section explores‚Äç the crucial ‚Äçelements that define a high-quality cup and ‚Äåsaucer set, providing insights into what to look for when making your purchase.

**Material and Durability**

The material‚Å§ of a cup and saucer set significantly impacts its‚Å£ durability, ‚Äçaesthetic appeal, and ‚Äãheat retention. Bone china, renowned for its delicate appearance and extraordinary strength,‚Äå is a popular‚Äã choice for formal ‚Äçsettings.Porcelain, another elegant option, offers‚Å§ excellent durability and a smooth, non-porous surface. ‚Å¢ceramic and stoneware sets, known for ‚Äåtheir robust construction and rustic ‚Äåcharm, are well-suited for everyday‚Å¢ use. ‚Å¢Glass sets‚Å¢ offer a modern aesthetic and‚Äç allow you to appreciate the color ‚Äåof your beverage. ‚ÄçEach material presents‚Å§ a unique combination of attributes ‚Äçthat should be considered based on your specific‚Äç needs and preferences.

**design and‚Äã Style**

Design and style define the aesthetic appeal and overall presentation of the cup and saucer set.Conventional designs ‚Å¢often feature intricate floral‚Äç patterns, gilded accents, and classic shapes, evoking a ‚Äçsense of timeless elegance. Modern designs,‚Å§ characterized by clean lines, minimalist ‚Äçornamentation, and bold colors, cater to contemporary tastes. Whimsical and novelty sets ‚Å§incorporate unique shapes, playful motifs, and ‚Å§imaginative details, adding a ‚Å¢touch‚Äã of personality to your‚Äã table setting.Ultimately, ‚Å¢the ideal design should‚Äå complement your‚Äå existing tableware ‚Å£and reflect your individual style.

**Cup Capacity and Size**

Cup capacity significantly impacts the drinking experience,influencing the size of the beverage you can enjoy. Demitasse cups,‚Äã typically holding ‚Äå2-3 ounces, are designed for‚Å§ espresso or strong coffee. Tea cups, ranging ‚Äåfrom 6-8 ounces,‚Äç are ideal for ‚Äãtraditional tea service. Coffee cups, frequently enough holding 10-12 ounces, cater ‚Å£to larger servings of coffee or ‚Å§latte. The saucer size should be‚Äå proportionally‚Å¢ aligned with‚Äã the ‚Å£cup ‚Äåto provide stability and visual balance, usually protruding half ‚Äåan inch to ‚Äãan‚Å¢ inch beyond the cup's rim.

**Handle ‚Å§Design‚Äã and ‚Å¢Comfort**

The handle ‚Äãdesign plays a crucial‚Äç role‚Å§ in ensuring a comfortable and secure grip while drinking. Ergonomic handles, designed to fit naturally in the hand, minimize strain and fatigue.Wide handles, suitable for larger fingers,‚Å£ provide a stable and secure hold.‚Å§ delicate handles, often seen on fine china sets, require a more careful‚Å¢ and refined‚Å¢ grip.‚Äã Consider ‚Äçthe weight and balance of the‚Äå cup in relation to the handle design to ensure ease of use and prevent spills.

- Voice notes from phone ‚Üí automatically added to task list with priorities

- Receipt photo ‚Üí expense automatically categorized and logged

**IFTTT for home stuff:** 
- Coffee maker starts 10 minutes before alarm

- Phone goes silent during focus time blocks

**Airtable + automation:** Built a simple CRM that automatically follows up with prospects based on where they are in my pipeline. Used to be terrible at follow-ups.

**Epic no-code failures:**

Tried to build a complex project management system in Notion with tons of automation. Spent weeks on it, used it for 3 days, then went back to simple task lists.

Automated social media posting - sounded great in theory but came off super robotic. Learned some things just need human touch.

**Tools that actually stuck:**
- Zapier (worth every penny of the monthly cost)
- Calendly (eliminated scheduling hell)
- IFTTT (great for simple stuff)
- Recurring deliveries for consumables (not sexy but super effective)

In summary: my ex-girlfriend has BPD, she broke up with me in a very abrupt and unpredictable way about two weeks ago. We had plans to get married, live together, go on vacation, etc., much of what I can read that we have all suffered. It's horrible.

But after breaking up, she hasn't stopped talking to me. Every day, religiously at 8 AM, she asks me how I woke up, how I feel, then she tells me a little about her day, anecdotes, sometimes she gets affectionate or romantic, sometimes she doesn't. Our conversation always ends with: ‚ÄúAre you off work yet? Let me know when you get home, please, I'm worried.‚Äù

She repeats the exact same pattern every day. However, this week she's been very distant. It's true that she keeps repeating the same pattern, but she's not as affectionate anymore. And when I ask her questions, she responds with very strange things that make me a little worried about her mental health. For example, when I asked her how she was (because she hadn't written for many hours), she apologized, saying she knew she had been a little disconnected, and then she sent me a picture with a supermarket offer that she recommended. Today, when I asked her some more questions, she simply sent me a picture of a drawing of a dog riding a pony. Honestly, I'm left with the feeling that I don't really understand what's going on.

Should I ask her to meet up for coffee so we can talk? I need some certainty with everything that's going on. What does she really want? Or does she even know what she wants?

If I didn't know she had BPD, I could rationally guess that she wants to get back together. But this week she has been acting so strangely and erratically that I don't really understand what's going on, even knowing about her condition.

**1. Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game for the Slightly Less Sleepy**  
Let‚Äôs start with the cold, hard math. The odds for this opener of the Leagues Cup 2025 are as clear as a summer sky‚Äî*if you squint*.

* **CF Montreal** is the slight favorite, with decimal odds ranging from **2.25 (DraftKings/Bovada)** to **2.43 (BetRivers)**. That translates to an implied probability of **44.4% to 40.7%**‚Äînot a landslide, but enough to suggest Montreal‚Äôs coach isn‚Äôt sleeping in a tent this week.
* **Le√≥n** checks in at **2.9 (all bookmakers)**, implying a **34.5% chance**. Not bad for a Mexican side whose defense might as well be a sieve with a LinkedIn profile.
* The **draw** hovers around **3.4 to 3.55**, or **29.4% to 28.3%**. That‚Äôs higher than you‚Äôd expect for a match this early in a tournament, suggesting both teams might be playing with one eye on their regular-season schedules.

The **totals line** is **2.5 goals**, with **over priced at 1.82-1.83 (54.9% implied)** and **under at 1.96-2.0 (51.3% implied)**. The spread? Montreal is a **-0.25 favorite**, meaning they‚Äôre expected to win by a margin smaller than a single coffee bean.

*Translation*: This is a low-scoring, tight contest where neither team wants to lose, but Montreal‚Äôs edge is paper-thin.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and a Side of Absurdity**  
Let‚Äôs check the injury reports. Spoiler: there aren‚Äôt any. But that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no drama.

* **CF Montreal** is fresh off a season where they‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre not the MLS‚Äôs version of Messi‚Äôs Inter Miami. Their offense is like a toaster in a bakery‚Äî*present but useless*. But with the Leagues Cup offering a ticket to the Concacaf Champions Cup, they‚Äôre motivated. Motivated and slightly less sleep-deprived than their Mexican counterparts.
* **Le√≥n**, meanwhile, is a Liga MX team with a storied history but a current roster that seems to include three players named ‚ÄúJos√©‚Äù and a fourth who‚Äôs jus

I've read a bunch of guides, recommendations, and other reddit posts, and the gist I'm getting is that as long as it's well maintained by the property owner, I just need to:

* Be careful with how much undigested food goes down the drain  
* Not pour grease or coffee grounds down the drain (which I don't do anyway)  
* Not do tons of laundry in one day, and not run the washer and dishwasher at the same time  
* Not flush anything other than TP (which I don't do anyway)  
* Limit bleach and don't use anti-bacterial soap  

I live alone, so that takes some pressure off the system. But I still have some questions about day-to-day living to make sure I don't screw up and cause major issues. For these questions, just assume that the system is well maintained and has no known existing problems:

* Twice a day, I rinse out 1 or 2 cans of cat food in the sink so I can recycle the cans. Over time, is this going to be enough food down the drain to be a problem?  
* I'm also generally concerned about rinsing small amounts of food/grease down the drain after wiping dishes into the trash. Just how sensitive are these systems?  
* The kitchen sink has a disposal. Is this not an indication that some amount of food down the drain is acceptable?  
* Can I use a toilet bowl cleaner that contains bleach once a month in my toilet? If not, how the hell do you disinfect toilets?  
* What about anti-bacterial shower cleaner? This I can limit to once every 2 months maybe...  
* I typically clean house with rags, and then throw them in the washer with some bleach. This results in cleaning products + bleach draining from the washer. Is this a problem, assuming I do this about twice a month? Or do I need to just spend a LOT more money switching entirely to paper towels?  
* What about mopping?!  
* Any tips for preventing hair from going down the shower drain?  

If you made it this far, thank you so much and I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just really don't want to do the wrong thing and end up with a nightmare scenario. The overarching question is: how much of the lease stipulations are likely there just to cover the property manager's butt?

Create a Proper Writing Schedule

To succeed in the demanding task of following fiction writing prompts, treat yourself and your writing with importance. Establish and consistently adhere to a designated writing schedule. Maintaining a regular writing routine prevents the project from fading into obscurity.



It‚Äôs challenging to retain the novel‚Äôs details in your mind for quick and efficient writing. Allowing substantial intervals between writing sessions and working haphazardly only increases the difficulty and likelihood of abandoning the endeavor.



Don‚Äôt Expect Your Words to Be Perfect

Many writers start working on fiction writing prompts with excitement, but upon rereading, their work may not meet their expectations, leading to deleting it entirely. Avoid being overly critical of your writing.



Excessive self-editing can halt your progress and prevent you from writing beyond the initial pages. Instead, focus on writing and avoid scrutinizing it until you have completed the story. Rewriting is essential for crafting great novels, and most writers would not share their first drafts with others.



Relax a Little

Free Woman Holding Gray Ceramic Mug Stock Photo



Are you unable to follow fiction writing prompts because the thought of it overwhelms you? Start by loosening up with some free writing. Dedicate five or ten minutes to jotting down whatever pops into your mind, and don‚Äôt pause or edit.



This exercise helps remove the mental block between your thoughts and your writing. It will help you to prepare for the actual writing process, akin to stretching before a workout.



Explore Your Ideas

Free Clear Light Bulb Stock Photo



When you first come across your fiction writing prompts, document all your notions and ideas regarding your desired novel. Jot down even the vaguest thoughts and concepts that come to mind. Identify any compelling questions you want to delve into.



Take notes on any particular setting, historical period, or topic that captivates you. Through this free-form writing, ideas will gradually emerge and take form.



Switch Between Plotting and Writing

Free Typewriter Stock Photo



As you begin working on your fiction writing prompts, engage in a simultaneous process of developing the plot and crafting the actual text. Planning the plot provides structure and direction for your writing.



However, immersing yourself in the writing allows you to experience the story on a deeper level, discovering new insights and nuances. This interactive approach enhances both aspects of the creative process.



Think About Your Characters

Free Photo Of Person Using Computer Stock Photo



Delve into the depths of your characters beyond their actions and names while working on writing prompts. Consider creating character profiles and mood boards with images that resonate with them. Test their limits in challenging situations to witness their reactions.



Engage in dialogue to develop their unique voices. Remember, characters in a novel should not be mere pawns in your narrative. They require motivation to drive their actions and make them more relatable and compelling.



Focus on the Structure

Free Top view of anonymous woman in casual wear sitting on floor with laptop and smartphone and creating plan on notebook while resting during break in modern living room Stock Photo



As you progress with your fiction writing prompts, consider the overall structure of your novel. Determine the timeline of your story. Will it cover a short period or an entire lifetime? Divide it into chapters or sections based on significant events or time periods.



Choose a narrative perspective to follow the writing prompts. Will the events be narrated by a first-person character reflecting on the past or unfold in real time? These structural decisions will provide a framework for your story and ensure it flows smoothly.



Set Some Targets

Free Person Holding White Stylus Stock Photo



Some people prefer setting goals and deadlines while following fiction writing prompts. Consider setting writing goals that you can reasonably achieve, such as writing 3,000 words weekly or 1,000 words daily.



Alternatively, you could aim for broader deadlines, like completing a third of your first draft by the end of the year. Choose targets that feel manageable and adjust them as needed to ensure success.



Try to Use the Active Voice

Free Flat Lay Photography of Unfold Book Beside Macbook Stock Photo



To captivate readers with your fiction writing prompts, aim for page-turners that hook them from the first page to the last. Employ the active voice predominantly in your stories. Construct sentences using the clear and concise order of nouns (subject) performing an action (verb) and affecting an object. Passive voice can be useful occasionally but use it sparingly in your fictional works.



How to Get Rid of Writer‚Äôs Block

Free Woman Reading a Book Beside the Window Stock Photo



You might often encounter writer‚Äôs block while working on creative writing prompts. Here are some ways to get rid of writer‚Äôs block:



Read a Lot

Most writers find their passion for writing through reading. To enhance your writing skills and get creative outputs for your writing prompts, revisit your literary roots by reading extensively. Focus on contemporary and acclaimed works within your specific genre or area of interest. By immersing yourself in the latest literature, you‚Äôll gain inspiration, identify gaps in the market, and determine how you can make a unique contribution to the field.



Take Breaks

To avoid burnout while working on writing prompts, take frequent breaks. Step away for a quick coffee break when feeling stuck. If needed, take longer breaks, like an afternoon drive or even a full day off. These breaks allow your mind to relax, giving you a refreshed perspective when you return to writing.



Avoid Comparison

Even if you are skilled in writing, there will always be individuals with greater proficiency or who have been writing for longer. Each person‚Äôs writing journey and experiences are different. Is it fair to contrast your writing abilities with someone who may have gained more experience?



Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on improving your own writing. Embrace the uniqueness of your voice. By honing your skills and sharing your perspective, you will attract an audience that resonates with your writing style.



Try Different Writing Methods

Changing your writing tools can refresh your approach and overcome writer‚Äôs block. If you typically write on a computer, try writing by hand. If you have a typewriter, use it for a unique sensory experience.



If you‚Äôre still stuck, walk outside and talk your ideas into a recorder or your phone. The physical activity and verbalization can spark new creativity.



Discover Your Peak Creativity Hours

Identify if your mind is most alert for creative writing in the morning or evening. Adjust your schedule of working on writing prompts accordingly.



Explore different locations to find where you write best, whether it‚Äôs a bustling coffee shop, a serene beach, or a secluded bedroom. Choose the environment that fosters your creativity.



Eliminate distractions by turning off Wi-Fi, removing your phone from your workspace, and requesting quiet time from others. This allows you to focus and tap into your creative flow.



Write Your Next Masterpiece With These Creative Writing Prompts for Adults

Whether you have a book writing template all filled out or you are starting from scratch, these writing prompts will get your imagination going and make your writing time more productive.



Beat the writer‚Äôs block, get your groove back, or just be inspired.  Figure out how to love writing again. Whatever you‚Äôre looking for, hopefully, these ideas have helped form the story you need to tell.

Since I own a lot of induction cooktops, and I'm a huge fan, I tested the Flair Wizard on one of them and it was compatible, though finnicky, because of the small diameter of the base.

So I did some research into the smallest and lowest wattage induction cookers (so I could plug it into a pretty populated power strip without too many worries), looking for ones supporting very small diameter pans/kettles.

Found the ""Abangdun Mini Induction Cooktop, 500W 110V Mini Electric Countertop Burners Portable Small Induction Hot Plate"" on Amazon US (ASIN B0C1YHLMLD), which claimed it supported cooking implements with a ""diameter of 3.9 inches to 6.5 inches."" which was perfect for the Flair Wizard.

The setup is great. You can set it to low/medium power (30% to 50% depending on altitude and other factors) and it will keep the pressure gauge in the perfect steaming range. 

The only caution I have is that since neither the hot plate nor the Flair Wizard are textured, the Wizard slides around a little too easily. So you need to be careful.

Fast forward 6 and 1/2 years later I felt strong enough to have another kid. She's here and now for the last 6 months I've been in in an overthinking, overanalyzing, high anxiety state of hell. I've been told and I'm starting to realize that I'm having some OCD thoughts. Like I can't get off of a loop of about 1- 3 different topics. I don't know why it's so hard. I know it's happening but I'm just stuck.

Doctors attempted to put me on ssris/SNRI that just made me feel s***** for the first time. My counselor and my psychiatrist and my hormone specialists think I need to go on Vyvanse and possibly bypass the anti-anxiety depression medication. 

I'm afraid that my overthinking will just be exasperated, but they think it'll help me come out of my paralyzed state of decision paralysis and state of disbelief. I can't believe that someone can go from feeling confident and normal to feeling this shitty. 

I'm terrified to try another drug because my experience has been anything but enjoyable. It has caused me a lot more anxiety and stress. I'm overthinking my daughter's name. I'm overthinking if we should live where we live bc we're so far away from family. It's just a disaster. I'm typically the independent one in the family. However, the way I am now, I'm stressing my husband and parents out because I am am acting out of character. I've been completely transparent with them due to not wanting to hide what's going on but now I just feel like they don't know what to do. 

My next step is to try Vyvanse like three of my Physicians have told me to do but I'm terrified. Does anyone have positive stories to help me get out of my head. Will this ever get better!! Please tell me it will!! 

Thank you I'm advance for the positivity and encouraging thoughts!",1,1753823495.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been having this issue with CS2 for a while now:

* The AWP | PAW skin isn‚Äôt displaying its pattern correctly; it looks broken.
* After 1‚Äì2 matches, my FPS suddenly drops hard, the game starts stuttering and becomes almost unplayable.
* When I minimize CS2, it often stops responding and I have to force-close it via Task Manager.
* My hardware is strong enough (CPU, GPU, RAM), everything runs fine, and MSI Afterburner shows no errors.
* I‚Äôve verified the game files on Steam, no issues found.
* Steam Support says the issue is fixed, but it‚Äôs still happening for me.

Anyone else facing these problems? Any workarounds or tips?

So a few days ago I kept hearing sounds like something was banging against the wall, rummaging, scratching, and when I looked under the sink and saw no activity I assumed that the neighbours are moving things or just renovating. 

But yesterday I noticed that my trashcan, that‚Äôs also under the sink, was rummaged into and some food remains near it. I assumed something was up but I didn‚Äôt see the hole and waited for today to see if the same thing happened.

I came home late and noticed the same thing, and when I stuck my head under the pipes I saw the hole. I looked with the flashlight through it and I can see cables and wall remains. Since it‚Äôs late, I‚Äôll contact the land lord asap tommorrow. For now, I covered it with an object & duct tape so it can keep it contained for at least tonight. 

I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a rat or a mouse, I didn‚Äôt see droppings as of now, neither the entity itself (hope I don‚Äôt cause I‚Äôm scared of the diseases it may carry). 

I‚Äôm looking for advice since I think the hole is very big itself, I didn‚Äôt even know rodents could go through apartment walls that deep.

We're two women from Poland planning a road trip in November (around 18 days). We've prepared four itineraries but can't decide which one to choose, and I was wondering if you could help us out.

A little about us: We enjoy nature (though we‚Äôre not big hikers), rural areas, and cities. We won‚Äôt spend much time in museums.

**Store Data:**

  - North America: 18,734
  - International: 22,363
  - Net 898 stores opened YTD

**Risks:**
- **Operating Margin Pressure:** Operating margin fell by 6.8 percentage points YoY in Q3 due to higher product and distribution costs (31.3% of revenue vs 30.1%), store operating expenses (45.9% vs 42.0%), and increased general/admin expenses associated with the ‚ÄúLeadership Experience 2024‚Äù and restructuring ($21M Q3, $137M YTD).
- **Rising Store Expenses:** Store operating expenses as a percent of company-operated revenues rose to 55.6% in Q3 (vs 50.9% prior year), reflecting increased wages/benefits ($2.48B in Q3 vs $2.22B) and occupancy costs.
- **Equity Investees Contribution Decline:** Income from equity investees down $17M in Q3, particularly from lower contributions from North American Coffee Partnership joint venture.
- **Effective Tax Rate Increase:** Effective tax rate rose to 31.8% in Q3 (from 24.8% prior year).
- **Debt Load:** High leverage with $17.45B in total debt; ongoing need to manage covenants under new $3.0B credit facility.
- **Commodity, Labor, and Supply Chain Volatility:** Increases in the cost of green coffee, dairy, labor, and disruptions highlighted as ongoing risks; $250M committed to green coffee purchases.
- **Global Economic and Market Risks:** Challenges in international markets, changing consumer preferences, intensifying competition, supply chain reliability, and foreign currency fluctuations (notably impact on translation adjustments).

**Management Discussion:**
- **Comparable Sales and Expansion:** Q3 revenue growth was driven by net new stores (308 opened in Q3, 898 YTD) and ‚ÄúBack to Starbucks‚Äù strategy progress. Comparable store sales growth is cited as a crucial driver, though results point to muted gains and ongoing margin headwinds due to macroeconomic factors.
- **Restructuring:** $137M YTD restructuring charges focus on workforce and organizational streamlining, especially in support functions, as part of efficiency efforts.
- **Cost Management:** Management notes increased operating expenses, particularly labor and investments in store experience/expansion, as drivers of margin compression. General and administrative expenses rose due to strategic employee events and initiatives to improve talent retention.
- **Capital Allocation:** Capital expenditures remain elevated (over $1.84B YTD), reflecting ongoing investment in store openings, equipment, and technology. Dividends remain a priority, with $2.08B distributed this year.
- **Acquisition:** Starbucks acquired 100% of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited (U.K. licensee), adding $106M in goodwill to the International segment and contributing to net company-operated store growth.
- **Forward Outlook:** Management anticipates continued macroeconomic challenges for the balance of the year and continues to focus on cost containment, supply chain stability, and strategic brand investments.

**Conclusion:**
Starbucks continues to deliver moderate top-line growth driven by global store expansion and brand investment but faces profit margin compression due to higher labor, distribution, and administrative costs. The company maintains a strong liquidity position but operates with high leverage. Investors should monitor ongoing margin pressures, the pace of international growth, cost containment progress, global economic risks, and execution of the restructuring/efficiency initiatives.

The foods I eat most commonly are coconuts (oil, butter, milk), avocados, eggs, 85/15 ground beef, full fat dairy, olive oil, macadamia nuts and black coffee (usually with MCT oil).

1mcnay7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/1mcnay7/pclate_90searly_2000spuzzle/,[PC][Late 90s/Early 2000s][Puzzle],"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been trying to remember the name of an old puzzle game I used to play on PC (Windows 95/98 era), possibly from a Spanish CD compilation of games (likely bundled with a magazine). 

Here's what I remember:

Main mechanic: You controlled a small white or black ball by moving your mouse ‚Äî the cursor would turn into the ball itself.

The game responded to mouse sensitivity: if you moved too fast or hit a wall, the ball would ‚Äúcrash‚Äù and break, producing a loud ""Crash!"" sound.

Some levels had a different mechanic where you controlled two balls connected by a kind of rubber band or rope, and had to alternate control between them to solve movement puzzles.

Music: There was no background music, only simple sound effects (especially the crash).

The game had a well-designed interface, and a charming ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù section styled like a real-life desk: it showed a coffee cup, handwritten notes, and photos of the developers.

The game was in English, but I suspect it came on a Spanish CD compilation ‚Äî I vaguely remember the installation folder being something like HH_Mesa or HP_Mesa.

I think the name started with P, possibly something like ‚ÄúPeroyds‚Äù, although I might be misremembering.

It wasn‚Äôt a top-down rolling ball game like Rollin‚Äô or Marble Madness. The perspective was like a tabletop game ‚Äî and it wasn‚Äôt about physics simulation but precise mouse control and timing.

I‚Äôve searched databases of Cosmi, GSP, eGames, and many abandonware archives but nothing matches. If this rings any bells or sounds familiar to anyone ‚Äî I'd love your help tracking it down. It's one of those games etched in my memory.

1mcn8rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Much_Long1501/comments/1mcn8rq/thank_you_christopher_robin/,Thank you Christopher Robinüåπ,"Thank you for coming to me. For asking me to go for a drive to get me coffee ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π and sharing about the pathway you found forward in your educational plans‚Ä¶ I really am so happy you found something that aligns with the way you‚Äôd like to see that accomplished. It‚Äôs one of the things I admire & delight in about you. You know this but I‚Äôm reflecting & want to share the thoughts. Take a chance‚Ä¶.. that well, I‚Äôm taking the chance to make a change.

- Your lifetime commitment to learning and gaining that academic achievement you‚Äôve always had set for yourself- I simply cherish it. It always brings w/it those feelings of innocent and unabashed idealism I had seen you with when we were in school- it has its whole own mental picture: you coming down the hall toward my locker blonde messy curly hair shining to match your bright eyes trained right on me, books in hand, light of step- and that smile- Oh baby that smile. You were (& still are) a god damn smoke show. And me just standing there holding the floor down feeling goofy, smitten, & just dying to be any and everything you‚Äôd be proud of. *Specifically - this mental picture is from that report card day I was so excited to show you. I‚Äôd shocked myself by how drastically I‚Äôd brought up my grades. The sparkle in your eyes and the flush of your cheeks told me just how proud you really were. And that was THAT. Bubby. I knew forEVER all I wanted to do was believe in and be everything you told me I already was (and I knew. You were just the first person in my life to actually hold me accountable to that) to love me. Others might see that as demeaning to my family- but you know. You KNOW. And that has made it so tough on us too. Oh, the attachment I have to you in the birthplace of that love & giving you my innocence. It‚Äôs irrevocable. I‚Äôve expressed this- in this presence it‚Äôs *powerful* (that‚Äôs a reflection for later)

That‚Äôs exactly who we were to one another- best friends that never held back much. We were a handful and then some for the world and one another, yet we thrived and cultivated that dynamic & passion for pushing ourselves and one another. We‚Äôd mapped out goals that spanned years ahead of us. Something we frankly were better at then than we are now. But Life was very VERY real for us- this we know, those plans kept us vibrant. Thirsty for life and one another‚Ä¶. But my point here is‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs still exactly who we are. 

We do not hold back on one another. Not even a little. In fact, we‚Äôre exacting of one another; we simply lost our ability to see with the eyes of our 16/17 yr old selves. We could hold space for such complexity and yet still believe and trust in the intentions of one another even when our shit behavior indicated otherwise. I‚Äôm certain that had a whole lot to do with the impact and behavior of those around us we didn‚Äôt have any say in, bc even now- neither one of us is truly given to ‚Äúacting out‚Äù. The stark truth is, we‚Äôre extraordinarily intentional people and we make moves for maximum impact. Straight up. The biggest difference between then & now. Then: our greatest priority was protecting one another, it was our present and active intention bc the world around us was more than unkind; it was malicious, jealous, & intended to sever our bond. We knew and understood that reality & did all 2 kids could to navigate something that should never have happened to us.
Now- we both seem to be far too comfortable with one another‚Äôs discomfort. We seem to only capitulate to that notion of protecting and guarding one another in the chaos we conjured in the way we began & broke. It‚Äôs there‚Ä¶ somewhere under all the ego and pride.

We alluded to it now, but our pride dictates we hold the line doesn‚Äôt it??? Right is right- wrong is wrong and since we‚Äôre big boys and girls we should have it figured out. That‚Äôs the undeniable belief we operate under, we can ‚Äúsay‚Äù oh mistakes is what it takes to learn a thing and blah blah blah. But when the pain, anxiety, & discomfort of being messy, mentally ill, & intellectually exceptional all hit‚Ä¶.. the gloves are off. We do not suffer fools and neither of us are very kind to performative behavior. It triggers some disgust and yet, we persist & participate. 

It was SO good to hear you speak on that. The perpetuation of participation. I love how organically that conversation took shape. I love even more how real that felt. 

Well‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve run out of steam. I really took more time on writing this one out. 
It feels‚Ä¶. Like bliss to speak from a place of alignment & authenticity. For me- Even though I‚Äôm fighting that resistance & externalized pride‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt be that character anymore. It‚Äôs abrasive to my heart, to my mind, to my spirit. The God within me balks at such dishonor for my husband ‚Ä¶. No matter your personal choices darling, more and more I see the toll that that filling that role just to keep a guard on the intensity of fear that washes over me at times. - the fear that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
You don‚Äôt want me anymore.

Not that I‚Äôm not the only one. I‚Äôve never needed that. I just don‚Äôt. I never have. I know me and my heart. I know just how much love and presence the human heart is capable of holding. You loving and desiring and being fulfilled by another person who brings you joy delights me babe. And I get it. A whole lot of people feel contempt for that kind of thing. I however am completely comfortable that I am that way. It fully grinds my wheeze for you to indulge your joy. ü•π As it SHOULD. I think it‚Äôs fucking weird that people only feel loved by being a chosen exception‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs ok, I do not judge anyone for the shapes and forms their desires& love takes. We‚Äôre all dynamic and ever changing beings on a journey.

That fear is valid bubby- when you‚Äôre done loving, longing, & feeling seen by your loves‚Ä¶ you quit them quietly. Recast their roll far In advance & set to methodically pushing them out of your life. 
- it‚Äôs the silence of it I fear. Not the possibility or eventuality. I of all people know that tomorrow isn‚Äôt promised. Life can change in an instant. Befores stack up as we move along & sometimes we make the mistake of looking a little too long at before and romanticizing its ease while forgetting the moment that changed it all. Those moments are for refinement. Refinement makes the After precious. Understood. And ultimately far more vibrant to exist in. 

Those who have known extraordinary suffering understand the fullness joy. 
Those who have buried loves cleaved from their very chest understand HOW to BE HELD.
Those who have fought their way out of the depths of trauma understand the Devine privilege of being Present. 

With that I‚Äôll close. Because we have today. We have this time and space in our home. We have tender if not timid kisses to exchange. Hands to hold. And one another‚Äôs company to keep. üåπ

This is a seasonal side business, we will manage, my wife will look over day to day (works part time), hire local teens, our kids friends, or college kids that stay in town for the summer.

I have the opportunity to lease a small plot of land, semi rural area with people looking for things to do, very good volume of traffic (estimate over 100/hour +), existing store across the street that's a staple of the community that we can draw from without competing with them, and the closest ice cream option is 15-20 minutes away (and you have to find parking downtown).  Not a high cost of living area, but properties ranging from $200k at the min to $10m, not a poor area and in a spot where a lot of ppl come to vacation in the summer.  The idea comes from a similar ice cream shop that opened in the neighboring town (30 - 45 min drive), open during the summer months, Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday, stays packed, people from our town (including myself) drive there for ice cream on the weekends.  Nothing special, milkshakes, cones, cups, but quality product with good customer service.

Initial plan is a 'cottage shed' that can be brought in on a rollback, wired for electricity, move in ice cream freezers, blenders for milk shakes, cut out a service window.  For ice cream we'll order from one of the wholesalers like Hershey.  Internet through Starlink so it can be shut off in the off season, POS system, iPad and register, social media only.  I've looked into the food regulations, we're covered there since we are not preparing food, just serving (have a friend in the coffee business in town, we fall under the same regulations and I picked his brain).

This straightforward statement captures the essence of what we call the ""Clarity Principle"" in marketing. The truth is, modern visitors don't read - they scan. Vague offers get forgotten while clear ones make an impact. Consider the difference between a fluffy phrase like ""Begin your creative journey"" versus a direct description like ""500 editable PowerPoint templates."" The first leaves visitors confused, while the second tells them exactly what to expect. But clarity isn't just about naming your product. It's the art of presenting essential information without beating around the bush. Instead of saying ""Invest in your future,"" state clearly ""Digital Marketing Course - $49."" Rather than using ambiguous descriptions like ""A unique unforgettable experience,"" provide precise wording like ""Project Management App - All tools in one place."" That said, there are situations where clarity requires some flexibility. When introducing a new or unfamiliar product, visitors need brief explanation. And during the awareness stage, it's better to start with the problem before presenting the solution. The principle is simple: Try making your offers clearer today. Revise your product titles, rewrite your call-to-action buttons, improve your ad headlines. You'll discover that clarity isn't just an option - it's become essential in a world where the average person encounters thousands of marketing messages daily.

Like a lot of you, I've got a busy life with a lot of competing demands and about an hour of time to myself on a workday. I'm absolutely not arsed spending that time on anything other than being a vegetable so here's some stuff I've found to make it all a bit more manageable. Pls add your own.



1. Equipment. 
Yep, this can be expensive and isn't essential but is very helpful. I love my deep freezer, instant pot and nutribullet. I've gotten some good silicone freezer trays that mean I can freeze smaller portions of dinners and eat them on days that I am a gremlin. Instant pot is great for making cheap cuts of meat taste good and makes the best rice. Also, very fast way to make a bunch of stock for soups etc. Nutribullet means I can make cashew milk for my coffee instead of buying non dairy milk with emulsifiers. 
If I had to choose from these three, it'd be the freezer.



2. One main prep day
It's usually Sunday. Restock freezers. Plan lunches. Use every dish in the house. Make a list.



3. Everybody loves pancakes
Make a bunch of easy snack foods that feel like a treat (in my house its blueberry banana pancakes). Bonus points for freezing well. Extra bonus points if theyre nut free and can go into a school lunch box. Jesus, feeding kids is a full time job. 



4. Bread
Look I don't do this everyday but I've learned a good basic bread recipe that I can make in max 2 hours and stops my loved ones from subsisting on the fluffy crap from the shop. The actual work is less than 5 mins, the rest is waiting. I do not knead. If I'm able to get my hands on it, I use fresh yeast. If not I use dried and don't get too upset about it. Have you looked at the nutritional info on the side of a pack of flour lately? It's not so bad. If you don't have mini gremlins in your house then you might even choose wholegrain. I add ground flaxseed (undetectable by said gremlins) so everyone can poop a little easier.  



5. When in doubt, use a formula
I'm very uninspired sometimes when making lunch so 2x veg, 1xprotein, 1x sauce, 1x carb/fibre sources is my go to. So cucumber, red pepper sticks, oven roasted salmon with a side of a sesame dipping sauce and some whole seed crackers will do. Or red cabbage, edamame, poached chicken, a cashew ginger sauce and a sweet potato I microwaved the bejesus out of. You can make it weirder than that. Sweetcorn, carrots sticks, tuna, pesto, a bran muffin, whatever you have.  The sauce is probably the hardest and that's not hard when you have a blender and Internet access.




6. Think once.
The hardest part for me is the endless juggling of tasks in my life. I do not have brain capacity for coming up with stuff on the fly I'M TIRED. Make a list on Saturday, grocery shop with that list, cook Sunday and freeze back what needs to be frozen. Defrost as required. Refer to the list.
I make 2 big dinners, pancakes, my lunches for 2 days (plus a plan for the others), 2 breakfasts (usually chia pudding), some sort of nice extra (scones, flapjacks that sort of thing) and components for school lunches. We cycle through the 2 types of dinners and usually defrost something else mid week. Rice goes into the instant pot while I'm doing laundry/homework. 
My one hour is protected for being unencumbered by any demands.


7. Quit, occasionally 
I am but one person and I sometimes decide that this week, I'll be having microwavable rice from the shop. Or ordering pizza on a Fri night. I have yet to find chocolate that doesn't have emulsifiers in it and I still eat it if I really want it. Overall I've reduced our UPF burden and that's gonna have to be good enough. 


I'm off to make chia pudding for the morning , I'd be delighted if anyone actually read this essay (!)  and had ideas to share.

1mcn38d,https://www.reddit.com/r/viseon/comments/1mcn38d/google_rich_results_their_impact_on_your_schema/,Google Rich Results - Their Impact on Your Schema Knowledge Graph - Part I - Artifacts,"Currently Google Rich Results is circa 12.2% registered types and the semantic Schema Graph for these is read each time your page is reviewed.

Schema has a vocabulary currently consists of 816 Types, 1516 Properties, 14 Datatypes, 94 Enumerations and 521 Enumeration members.

\### \`@type\`s Available for Google Rich Results include:

\### Step 1: Clarifying Nested vs. Standalone Types

\*\*98 \`@type\` values\*\* represent \*\*standalone types\*\* (primary types and their supported subtypes) that Google explicitly supports for triggering Rich Result features, as per Google‚Äôs Search Central documentation (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery). Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

\- \*\*Standalone Types\*\*: These are the primary \`@type\` values used to define the main entity for a rich result feature (e.g., \`Article\`, \`Event\`, \`Product\`, \`LocalBusiness\`, and their subtypes like \`NewsArticle\`, \`ComedyEvent\`, \`CafeOrCoffeeShop\`). The 98 types include:

  \- Top-level types (e.g., \`Article\`, \`Event\`, \`Product\`)

  \- Specific subtypes explicitly supported by Google (e.g., \`NewsArticle\`, \`BusinessEvent\`, \`CafeOrCoffeeShop\`)

\- \*\*Nested Types\*\*: These are types used within the properties of a primary type to provide additional context (e.g., \`AggregateRating\` or \`Offer\` nested within \`Product\`, or \`Review\` within \`LocalBusiness\`). Google‚Äôs documentation specifies that certain nested types are required or recommended for specific rich results (e.g., \`AggregateRating\` for star ratings in \`Product\` or \`LocalBusiness\`). However, these nested types are \*\*not counted\*\* in the 98 because they are not standalone rich result triggers; they enhance the primary type‚Äôs rich result display.

To clarify:

\- The \*\*98 \`@type\` values exclude nested types\*\* like \`AggregateRating\`, \`Offer\`, \`Rating\`, or \`Person\` (e.g., for \`author\` or \`reviewedBy\` properties), as these are not primary types that trigger a rich result on their own.

\- Nested types are used within the properties of the 98 standalone types to meet Google‚Äôs requirements for specific features (e.g., \`AggregateRating\` for review stars, \`Offer\` for product pricing).

\### Step 2: Identifying Nested Types for Rich Results

To calculate the total percentage of [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) types employed (parent or nested), we need to identify commonly used nested types that Google supports in its rich result features. Based on Google‚Äôs documentation and common practices (), the following nested types are frequently used within the 98 standalone types:

1. \*\*Common Nested Types\*\*:

   \- \`AggregateRating\`: Used in \`Product\`, \`LocalBusiness\`, \`Movie\`, etc., for star ratings.

   \- \`Review\`: Used in \`Product\`, \`LocalBusiness\`, \`Movie\`, etc., for individual review snippets.

   \- \`Offer\`: Used in \`Product\`, \`Event\`, \`Book\`, etc., for pricing and availability.

   \- \`Person\`: Used for \`author\`, \`creator\`, \`reviewedBy\`, etc., in \`Article\`, \`Review\`, etc.

   \- \`Organization\`: Used for \`publisher\`, \`provider\`, etc., in \`Article\`, \`Dataset\`, etc.

   \- \`ImageObject\`: Used for \`image\`, \`thumbnail\`, etc., in \`Article\`, \`Product\`, etc.

   \- \`PostalAddress\`: Used for \`address\` in \`LocalBusiness\`, \`Organization\`, etc.

   \- \`GeoCoordinates\`: Used for \`geo\` in \`Place\`, \`LocalBusiness\`, etc.

   \- \`ItemList\`: Used for \`breadcrumb\` (as \`BreadcrumbList\`) or carousel items.

   \- \`Rating\`: Used within \`Review\` or \`AggregateRating\` for rating values.

2. \*\*Counting Nested Types\*\*:

   \- From the CSV, the above nested types correspond to: \`AggregateRating\`, \`Review\`, \`Offer\`, \`Person\`, \`Organization\`, \`ImageObject\`, \`PostalAddress\`, \`GeoCoordinates\`, \`ItemList\`, \`Rating\`.

   \- Note: \`Review\` and \`AggregateRating\` were already included in the 98 standalone types for features like Critic Review and Employer Aggregate Rating. However, \`Organization\` is also counted in the 98 (for Organization and Logo rich results) but is frequently used as a nested type (e.g., \`publisher\` in \`Article\`).

   \- Excluding duplicates (\`Review\`, \`AggregateRating\`, \`Organization\`, \`ItemList\`), the additional nested types are: \`Offer\`, \`Person\`, \`ImageObject\`, \`PostalAddress\`, \`GeoCoordinates\`, \`Rating\`.

   \- \*\*Total additional nested types\*\*: 6.

3. \*\*Total Distinct Types (Parent + Nested)\*\*:

   \- Standalone types: 98

   \- Additional nested types: 6 (\`Offer\`, \`Person\`, \`ImageObject\`, \`PostalAddress\`, \`GeoCoordinates\`, \`Rating\`)

   \- \*\*Total\*\*: 98 + 6 = \*\*104 distinct \`@type\` values\*\* employed at parent or nested level for Google Rich Results.

\### Step 3: Calculating the Percentage

The \`schemaorg-current-https-types.csv\` contains \*\*853 [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) types\*\* (counted from the provided document, which lists types from \`3DModel\` to \`Zoo\`). To find the percentage of types employed for Google Rich Results (parent or nested):

\- \*\*Total employed types\*\*: 104

\- \*\*Total [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) types\*\*: 853

\- \*\*Percentage\*\*:  

  \\\[

  \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{104}{853} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 12.20\\%

  \\\]

\### Step 4: Notes and Considerations

\- \*\*Nested Types Scope\*\*: The 6 additional nested types cover the most common ones explicitly required or recommended by Google (e.g., \`AggregateRating\` for ratings, \`Offer\` for pricing). Other types like \`CreativeWork\`, \`Thing\`, or \`Intangible\` may appear in structured data but are too broad or not specifically required for rich results, so they are excluded from the count.

\- \*\*Dynamic Updates\*\*: Google‚Äôs supported types may change, and some types (e.g., \`VacationRental\` added in 2023) are already included in the 98 as subtypes of \`LodgingBusiness\`. Always verify with Google‚Äôs documentation (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery) for the latest list.

\- \*\*CSV Context\*\*: The CSV includes types marked as \`isPartOf: [https://pending.schema.org\`](https://pending.schema.org`) (e.g., \`AdvertiserContentArticle\`), but these are included in the 98 if Google supports them (per documentation). No additional pending types were found to be relevant for nested use in rich results.

\### Summary

The 98 \`@type\` values identified \*\*exclude nested types\*\*. Including commonly used nested types (\`Offer\`, \`Person\`, \`ImageObject\`, \`PostalAddress\`, \`GeoCoordinates\`, \`Rating\`), the \*\*total allowed \`@type\` list\*\* for Google Rich Results (parent or nested) is \*\*104 distinct types\*\*. 

The \*\*percentage of [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) types employed\*\* (out of 853 total types in the CSV) is approximately \*\*12.20%\*\* (\\( \\frac{104}{853} \\times 100 \\)).

\###Is Schema the de facto method to collect Rich Snippet Data?###

Schema.org structured data is not the only method to register rich snippets (or rich results) with Google, but it is the primary and most widely supported method. Google uses structured data to understand content and generate rich results, and Schema.org is the standard vocabulary it recommends. However, other methods and considerations exist, depending on the type of rich result and the platform. Below, I‚Äôll outline whether Schema.org is the sole method, alternative approaches, and their limitations, keeping the response concise and relevant to your question about registering rich snippets.

\### 1. [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) as the Primary Method

\- \*\*Why Schema.org?\*\* Google‚Äôs Search Central documentation (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data) strongly recommends Schema.org structured data to mark up content for rich results. It‚Äôs a standardized, open vocabulary supported by Google, Bing, and other search engines, ensuring compatibility and consistency.

\- \*\*Implementation Formats\*\*: [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) can be implemented using:

  \- \*\*JSON-LD\*\* (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data): Google‚Äôs preferred format, as it‚Äôs easy to parse and maintain.

  \- \*\*Microdata\*\*: Embedded in HTML attributes, less common but still supported.

  \- \*\*RDFa\*\*: Another HTML-based markup, rarely used for Google‚Äôs rich results.

\- \*\*Supported Rich Results\*\*: As identified previously, 104 [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) \`@type\` values (98 standalone + 6 nested) are used for features like Article, Product, Event, Local Business, etc.

\### 2. Alternative Methods for Registering Rich Snippets

While Schema.org is the primary method, Google supports other approaches for specific rich result types or contexts, often in addition to or instead of Schema.org structured data. These alternatives depend on the feature:

1. \*\*Google-Specific APIs and Tools\*\*:

   \- \*\*Event Rich Results via Third-Party Platforms\*\*: For event rich results, Google can pull data from specific ticketing platforms (e.g., Ticketmaster, Eventbrite) without requiring [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) markup on your site. These platforms use proprietary APIs or feeds that integrate with Google‚Äôs systems (). You can submit events directly through partners listed in Google‚Äôs documentation.

   \- \*\*Job Postings via Indexing API\*\*: For job posting rich results, Google supports the Indexing API for job boards or aggregators to push job data directly to Google, bypassing on-page Schema.org markup in some cases (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/job-postings#submit-jobs).

   \- \*\*Merchant Center for Products\*\*: For product rich results (e.g., shopping results with price and availability), Google Merchant Center feeds (structured data files like XML or CSV) can be used instead of or alongside Schema.org \`Product\` markup on your website (https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6069143).

2. \*\*Other Structured Data Vocabularies\*\*:

   \- \*\*Open Graph Protocol\*\*: Used primarily for social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn), Open Graph tags (e.g., \`og:title\`, \`og:image\`) can influence how content appears in Google‚Äôs Knowledge Panels or Discover feed, though they‚Äôre not directly used for most rich results ().

   \- \*\*Twitter Card Tags\*\*: Similar to Open Graph, Twitter Card markup (e.g., \`twitter:card\`, \`twitter:title\`) can affect content previews in Google Discover or social snippets, but not core rich results like Article or Product.

   \- \*\*Data Highlighter (Deprecated)\*\*: Previously, Google‚Äôs Search Console offered a Data Highlighter tool to manually tag content for rich snippets without coding Schema.org. This tool is no longer available, and Google now emphasizes structured data ().

3. \*\*Content-Specific Signals\*\*:

   \- \*\*AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)\*\*: For article rich results, AMP pages with minimal or no Schema.org markup can still trigger rich snippets (e.g., Top Stories carousel) if they follow AMP guidelines (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/amp).

   \- \*\*Video Metadata\*\*: For video rich results, Google can use metadata from video platforms (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo) or sitemaps with video-specific tags (e.g., \`<video:thumbnail\_loc>\`) in addition to Schema.org \`VideoObject\` markup (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video).

   \- \*\*Sitelinks Search Box\*\*: While [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) \`WebSite\` markup is preferred, Google may generate sitelinks search boxes based on site structure and internal search functionality without explicit markup ().

4. \*\*Google‚Äôs Machine Learning and Content Analysis\*\*:

   \- For some rich results (e.g., Knowledge Panels, Sitelinks), Google uses its algorithms to infer structured data from unstructured content (e.g., HTML headings, text patterns) without requiring [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) markup. However, this is less reliable and not developer-controlled ().

   \- Example: A well-structured page about a local business might trigger a Knowledge Panel without \`LocalBusiness\` markup, but adding [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) increases eligibility and accuracy.

\### 3. Limitations of Alternative Methods

\- \*\*Limited Scope\*\*: Alternatives like Merchant Center or ticketing platform APIs apply only to specific rich result types (e.g., products, events) and require integration with Google‚Äôs systems, which may not be feasible for smaller sites.

\- \*\*Less Control\*\*: Relying on Google‚Äôs algorithms or third-party platforms gives developers less control over how data is interpreted compared to [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) markup.

\- \*\*Incomplete Support\*\*: Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and other vocabularies don‚Äôt trigger most rich results (e.g., Article, Product, Review snippets) and are primarily for social or secondary features.

\- \*\*Deprecation Risks\*\*: Tools like Data Highlighter have been deprecated, and Google increasingly emphasizes [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) for consistency ().

\### 4. Why [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) Remains Dominant

\- \*\*Broad Coverage\*\*: [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) supports all 25+ rich result types listed in Google‚Äôs Search Gallery (e.g., Article, Event, Product, FAQ), unlike alternatives that are feature-specific.

\- \*\*Developer Control\*\*: [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) markup allows precise control over data presentation, ensuring Google interprets content correctly.

\- \*\*Cross-Platform\*\*: [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) is supported by other search engines (Bing, Yahoo) and platforms, making it more versatile than Google-specific APIs.

\- \*\*Validation Tools\*\*: Google‚Äôs Rich Results Test (https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) and Schema Markup Validator validate Schema.org markup, ensuring compliance.

\### 5. Connection to Previous Context

The 104 Schema.org \`@type\` values (98 standalone + 6 nested) relates to rich results enabled by Schema.org cover most rich result features, but alternatives like Merchant Center or ticketing APIs can complement or replace Schema.org for specific cases (e.g., \`Product\` or \`Event\`). If you‚Äôre optimizing a site like like www.differentia.consulting then Schema.org (e.g., \`LocalBusiness\`, \`Article\`) is likely the most reliable method, especially for general rich results like reviews or FAQs.

\### Summary

[Schema.org](http://Schema.org) structured data is \*\*not the only method\*\* to register rich snippets with Google, but it is the \*\*primary and most comprehensive\*\* approach.  
  
Schema.org covers all rich result types (including the 104 \`@type\` values), offers the most control, and is recommended for reliability. For specific rich results like products or events, combining Schema.org with APIs (e.g., Merchant Center) may enhance performance. Check https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery for details on supported methods per feature.

I'm currently struggling to decide which laptop would suit my needs better. The last 5 years I had a Acer Predator Triton 500 which had a battery life of 1h and felt like a brick, especially with the heavy loading cable.

I also have a PC with 32 GB of DDR5 RAM, an Nvidia 3060 and 2 TB SSD, which is pretty decent and fulfils my performance needs.

I would like to replace my laptop with an Apple device as I haven't found any comparable device in terms of performance and battery life.

I'm deciding between these two models:

MacBook Air (MBA) 15"", 24 or 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD

MacBook Pro (MBP) 16"", 24 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, possibly with nano texture.

The screen size must be at least 15"" as I'm very used to having three large screens with my PC setup, so the 14"" screen is far too small for me.

Use cases are:

\- Studying: I'm currently enrolled on an MSc in Banking and Finance and the CFA programme.

\- Programming with R and Python. I would also like to start doing some machine learning, but I'm really a newbie, so there won't be any complex LLM's.

\- Further, I edit real estate footage in Lightroom and create videos in DaVinci Resolve. Here, I see a possible bottleneck with the MBA, as I would like to use the Superscale AI and noise reduction features. However, I should mention that I only create short videos, mainly up to 2 minutes long and very occasionally up to 5 minutes.

\- The second, larger use case is trading. I use a lot of programs at once here, so I want to have enough RAM. The following programs run simultaneously: 2-3 Excel sheets, TradingView with 10 tabs, Refinitiv Workspace with 5 tabs, MetaTrader 4 (broker), OneNote, Google Chrome with \~10 tabs, and another trading tool. When everything is open, it uses around 20‚Äì24 GB of RAM on my PC. As the new M chips cannot be compared with Windows RAM, I am not sure which would be the best fit.

The laptop will be used on the go, e.g. at university, real estate appoiintments, coffee shops or on holiday.

I would prefer the MBA if you think it can handle my use cases, but I am also willing to buy the MBP.It's just that I don't want to have a overkill machine and use only half of it's power. Also the portability would be better with the MBA, but this won't help me if it won't manage my tasks.

Constantly striving for improvement, I've built a rather happy life for myself. Always looking for new goals, trying new ways of being healthier, and I LOVE learning and strive to always challenge my beliefs. I enjoy my career (I work as an operator in the chemical manufacturing industry), It provides a good living (which was lacking for most of my life lol) and it gives me an ample amount of time to stay in touch with you throughout the day if you're the type.  
  
Long distance relationships don't bother me too much (US only), ideally after a set amount of time we both feel like it's appropriate we would move in together and start that journey (relocation to me is ideal). 
  
I have a lot of interests ranging from gaming to binging watching some of my favorite shows; moral of the story is escapism is one of my favorite past times. I *love* running, go to the gym regularly, playing with my pit/lab mix dog named Strider (LOTR reference), a frequent flyer so i love to travel and reading (on a bit of a history theme lately). I love LOVE coffee, hanging with my friends, going to music festivals, and trying new restaurants. As you can tell, I'm a bit of a nerd so fantasy being a huge thing for me ranging from Lord of the Rings movies to the annual Harry Potter marathon around the holidays and everything in between. I do visit my local renaissance fair and try to plan a costume so it would be cool if we could bond that way!
  
I like small things in relationships that include weekend cuddles (obsessed), evening coffee shop reading dates, lazy mornings, random road trips and hitting the gym together! Maybe we're holding hands at the farmers market looking for dinner ingredients, snuggling in a hammock on a beautiful summer day, or riding bikes/running together. Putting on your playlist in the car cause chances are you're in charge of it xD, you sneaking kisses on my cheek while I'm playing games with my friends, dressing in our A+ outfits and getting lost in time on our date...I'm rambling too much but you get the gist.  
  
I think fundamentally, even if we don't share the same hobbies, having the same goals and future outlook is most important. I'm very inquisitive so I tend to ask a lot of questions, I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.  
  
I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have a thin/petite build or lean towards the athletic/fit side!

The everyday grind of laundry is something many of us cannot escape. My washing machine sees more action than my coffee machine on most days, making maintenance an unavoidable necessity. This drove me to try the Maravello MV04SS6 Washing Machine Cleaner Descaler Tablets. Keeping a washing machine running smoothly while deodorizing it sounded like a win, but I discovered there‚Äôs more to these tablets than what the product description boasts.

**Packaging and Design: Are the Details Spot-On?**

The clever packaging grabbed my attention immediately. Compact and lightweight, the box measures just 5.47 x 3.98 x 0.71 inches, resembling more of those small chocolate packages than heavy-duty cleaning supplies. Visually appealing, sure, but the 6-count supply seemed a bit underwhelming for my big family household. Each tablet is a mix of blue and white, giving off a professional look that screams, ""I mean business!"" However, the small supply might not feel as practical if you're tackling heavily-loaded machines on the regular.  

[Check Maravello MV04SS6 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0c32w9r8k/)  

**Unraveling the Strengths that Impressed Me**  

The ingenuity behind these tablets lies in their formula. Designed not just for front loaders and top loaders but also a wide range of washing machines, it feels like Maravello wanted to cater to anyone, regardless of their appliance specifics. Each ingredient in the formula works together to combat residue buildup, stubborn stains, and annoying grime, all while ensuring machine components remain safe.  

- Offers thorough cleaning and freshness for long-neglected washers.
- The sea salt scent makes post-cleaning incredibly refreshing.
- Easy-to-use because, let‚Äôs admit it, no one wants 32 steps for cleaning a tub.  
- Protects components, extending your machine‚Äôs life, which is money-saving.  

The moment my first trial run ended, the smell wafting from my washing machine was unmistakably fresh. It was as if the neglected crevices and nooks in my washer got the attention they had been missing for years. That‚Äôs always a plus with a house full of smelly gym clothes haunting the spin cycle.  

**Negative Attributes That Must be Noted**  

While I found many redeeming features, a few things could use tweaking. My inner perfectionist cringed a little from some shortcomings during usage.  

- The small 6-pack doesn‚Äôt justify the high-frequency cleaner needs for families running constant laundry cycles.  
- You might not detect immediate, visible changes in heavily soiled machines.  
- Slightly time-consuming for users who expect results after a single application.  

Of course, this doesn‚Äôt ruin the experience entirely, but it‚Äôs worth pointing out if you‚Äôre someone impatient like me.  

**Is There Room to Call In Competing Products?**

Other reputable cleaners in this niche include Affresh Washing Machine Cleaner Tablets and OxiClean Washing Machine Cleaner. While their packaging appears slightly less polished, Affresh tablets seem to tackle deep-seated gunk competently as well. However, the refreshing sea salt fragrance from the Maravello cleaner offers an edge; the other cleaners lean more toward subdued or clinical scents. With affordability taken into consideration, OxiClean finds balance for moderate-budget users, though its lasting effects might not match the consistent quality of Maravello.

Both these brands certainly pose a challenge, but Maravello stands firm, particularly for scent-sensitive users who thrive on freshness ‚Äî something I personally value as a dealbreaker.

**Quality for Price Analysis**  

Balancing affordability with impressive results is a tightrope every product walks, and these cleaner tablets perform relatively better compared to many overpriced counterparts. While the compact size of the supply might have raised an eyebrow initially, the significant difference in odor elimination and grime reduction left me more impressed. If maximizing the longevity and efficiency of your washing machine is a priority over penny-pinching, this is a worthwhile investment.

They're definitly not my daily drivers. I only put them on for dates and a night out with friends. But I want to wear them more often, for casual activities. Like those Pinterest photos of celebs wearing boots with a pair of jeans and a vintage t-shirt, during coffee runs e.g. Lenny Kravitz, Justin Theroux, David Beckham etc...

Thing is, I was wearing them around the mall today and obviously they are not as comfortable as sneakers, and probably never will be. My heels and toes started to ache a bit. As a sneaker guy who is slowly transitioning to the world of badass casual boot-wearing, are there any socks I can wear that can make the experience more pleasurable? I was wearing Levis socks.

1mcmrd9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcmrd9,$400 / Glendale - 3-Piece 135‚Äù U-Shaped Sectional Sofa with Double Chaise Lounge,"\- Original retail value is $4,797.00

\- Dimensions: 37""H x 135""W x 67""D

\- Upholstered in the classic, durable Douglas microfiber which repels water and stains

Many of us are born with the dream of owning a massive, U-shaped sofa, but at a normal retail price tag of almost $5,000, our dreams are often relegated to the lesser shape of an L. ""How will I afford a giant sofa?"" we cry in the night.

Enter, this pre-owned, Crate & Barrel Axis sofa. This behemoth measures 135"" across, making it perfect for hosting a gaggle of friends, or a crash-pad for your extra tall friend who can't get it together in life. The Douglas microfiber fabric repels pretty much all water-based stains, making it perfect if you have children, pets, or have a habit of setting your coffee down on the cushion like an idiot and spilling it.¬†

This sofa is about five years old and in generally good shape. There are no visible stains, and the cushions are largely plush.

Now, this sofa does come from a pet-inhabited home. The only visible damage is on the very back, where one of our cats has scratched it up. If you have a cat, they'll feel extra lucky about having this spot pre-worn for their important nail care.

This presents another opportunity: if, for some reason, you're stuck in a sitcom scenario where you have told somebody that you own a cat and now have to back it up with visual evidence, what better than this lightly distressed sofa? Sure, you could buy a litter box and some food bowls, but what sells the lie better than this? If you love sitting and elaborate rouses, this is the sectional for you. But don‚Äôt let our imagination be your limitation, this sofa has so much utility beyond seating or feline oriented deception: this sofa would fit right in on a set, in a demolition derby, or in one of those anger management destruction rooms we read about on the news in a dream one time.

We will Bissell this bad boy clean for you to get rid of any lingering smells or stains, free of charge. All upholstery that can be removed will be laundered in our top of the line ultra high capacity washer dryer/set (see our other listing if you‚Äôre buy-curious).

We can‚Äôt deliver them to you, but one of our two Jack Reacher sized occupants (we have one Tom Cruise and one Alan Ritchson) will help load them onto your preferred method of conveyance at no additional cost to you.

1mcmqrl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcmqrl,Losing a job isn‚Äôt the end - sometimes it‚Äôs the start of something new,"A few months ago, the company we worked for suddenly shut down. No warnings. No soft landings. Just gone.

It was scary - we were just a few people without a project, without income, and honestly, without a plan.

But instead of scrambling to find new jobs right away, we asked ourselves: ***What if we finally tried building something for ourselves?***

So we did.

We asked ourselves: *‚ÄúCan we make something cozy, weird, and funny all at once?‚Äù.* At first, it was just chaotic brainstorming. We threw ideas around like *‚Äúan idle game where you gather resources from snow‚Äù,¬† ‚Äúwhat if two types of resources are gathered differently, with upgrades for one requiring the other - and vice versa?‚Äù* and¬† *‚Äúwhat if upgrades improve gameplay mechanics and unlock new possibilities?‚Äù*

We had no idea what we were getting into, but the freedom to explore kept us hooked. No deadlines. No stakeholders. Just us and endless coffee and tea. At some point, we also started learning what the heck DOTS (Unity‚Äôs Data-Oriented Technology Stack) is, diving headfirst into new tech while figuring out everything else.

Slowly, the mechanics started forming. The game took shape. And eventually‚Ä¶ it became real.

*Paint the Snow - Idle* is an idle resource management game set in a snowy cartoon world:

ü™£ Meeples - living bucket-workers who help you gather resources  
üëª Spirits - your magical allies who fight with you against waves of monsters  
üå≤ Upgrades & unlocks - a huge tree of progression systems with evolving strategies

It started small - a bunch of weird ideas on a whiteboard - and grew into something we're proud of. We‚Äôre just a tiny team, but this one‚Äôs 100% ours.

So, I wanted to share my experience with **Clinical Skills Institute (CSI)** because when I was looking into becoming a Medical Assistant, I was overwhelmed with all the expensive programs out there. CSI kept popping up ‚Äî and honestly, I‚Äôm so glad I gave it a shot.

Here‚Äôs the lowdown:

I did the entire program online in my pajamas, from my couch, while drinking way too much coffee. It's self-paced, so no Zoom classes at 7am (thank goodness), and you can study when your brain actually works.

The tuition is $810 if you pay in full (or there's a monthly plan too), and get this ‚Äî they pay for your NHA exam. That‚Äôs a $165 test and CSI just covers it. You also get:

* Access to mock exams and an eBook
* Optional Zoom support with instructors
* Help with your resume, and externship placement if you want it

I studied like 3‚Äì4 hours a day and finished in about 2.5 months, but you get up to 12 months of access if life gets in the way ‚Äî because, well, life.

After I passed the practice test, they signed me up for the NHA certification, and I passed it on the first try! 

They even helped me reach out to clinics for an externship, and I ended up getting hired pretty quickly. Urgent cares love to bring on Medical Assistants ‚Äî especially when you‚Äôre trained and certified.

Honestly, the team at CSI was amazing. Super helpful, fast replies, and they never made me feel like I was just a number. They‚Äôre a self-funded program, not a giant corporate machine. So they‚Äôre growing through student success and word of mouth ‚Äî like this post!

You can verify them with NHA directly (just call: 800-499-9092).

Anyway, if you‚Äôre thinking about becoming a Medical Assistant, this is honestly one of the most affordable and flexible options out there.

I‚Äôve never lived in a place where I couldn‚Äôt walk or take public transport to anywhere I needed to get to so the idea of being in a house surrounded by tens of miles of other houses and no amenities is mind boggling to me.

On an average day i might wake up, go out, grab a coffee from the store at the corner, take a walk in the park, buy a bread on the way home and eat breakfast all before I start my work day. I can‚Äôt imagine having to get in a car, drive to a coffee place, get in the car again, drive to a park, get in a car again, go to the grocery store, get in the car again and get home.

What if you go out to drink? Do you drive home drunk? What if you forget to buy something at the store, you have to drive all the way back?

Even if you go to a restaurant at lunch and say you want to have a walk after but you‚Äôre in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere?

I just don‚Äôt understand why would people want to live like that and then actively oppose any projects that offer a minimal amount of mixed use (see: apartment buildings, more compact network of walkable roads, cycling paths, etc.)

Like, what do you do all day? Do you spend it mostly in the house? Isn‚Äôt it very isolating? I guess wouldn‚Äôt go out to meet a friend either if i knew it takes me 1 hour to go and 1 hour to come back.

And I‚Äôm not even talking about suburbia suburbia, but there are cities in America that, although they *have* sidewalks, they don‚Äôt make you want to walk on them - Las vegas or Los angeles seem walkable enough but then it‚Äôs just you and some lone bums under the burning sun with no shade or human activity for miles.

There are not a lot of 3rd spaces anywhere - parks (not forests with hiking trails, i mean Parks, with amenities), sidewalks with trees or shade, benches, etc.? Why?

I know America was built around cars,and that there is a housing crisis, but it‚Äôs 2025, wouldn‚Äôt smaller and more compact and mixed developments be a better use of money in order to create more housing and less isolation rather than creating more sprawl?",2,1753821116.0,TooAfraidToAsk,3,1.0,False

***How the US\~Observer Counterstrike Can Save Your Company***

In the savage, cutthroat jungle of financial markets, public companies are ruthlessly hunted by a vicious four-step assault crafted to annihilate their value and hurl them into bankruptcy. This merciless cycle begins with¬†**naked short selling**, a despicable, illegal tactic that drowns the market in counterfeit shares, followed by venomous smear campaigns, baseless class action lawsuits, and devastating regulatory pile-ons. Predatory hedge funds, short-selling vultures along with the now-defunct Hindenburg Research, and greedy ambulance-chasing attorneys orchestrate this slaughter, raking in profits while shareholders and issuers are left bleeding. As examples, companies like Bear Stearns and Luckin Coffee were crushed under this onslaught, while [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) clawed its way out through unrelenting and extremely expensive resistance. The US\~Observer, led by CEO Michael Quiel with a battle-hardened 30-year track record, is the¬†**only lifeline**¬†capable of obliterating this cycle at every stage. We rip apart fraud, shred false accusations, and drag regulators like the SEC, DOJ, and FINRA to the true culprits, stopping 80% of these attacks dead in their tracks, often discreetly to shield anonymity. Without the US\~Observer‚Äôs early intervention, companies face certain doom‚Äîonly we can thwart each step and save you from collapse.

**Step 1: Naked Short Selling**

**The Attack**:  
The massacre starts with naked short selling, where ruthless hedge funds sell shares they haven‚Äôt borrowed or confirmed, spitting in the face of SEC Regulation SHO (Investopedia). This floods the market with ‚Äúphantom‚Äù shares, gutting stock prices and strangling a company‚Äôs ability to raise capital. For example, Bear Stearns was battered by short selling in 2008, hastening its collapse into a JPMorgan Chase fire sale. Life Partners Holdings‚Äô stock was obliterated by similar pressure, paving the way for its 2016 bankruptcy (SEC Litigation).

**US\~Observer‚Äôs Counterstrike**:  
The US\~Observer hunts these market parasites with ferocious precision. We dissect trading data to expose illegal shorting, unmasking the hedge funds behind it. We then use the threat of exposure which our nationwide newspaper provides and approximately 80% of the time the wrongdoer will stop their damaging actions. If not, we then force FINRA and the SEC to crush the violators. Our swift action stabilizes stock prices, as seen with Overstock.com‚Äôs fight against short sellers. Only the US\~Observer can stop this initial bloodbath, preventing smear campaigns from taking hold and saving companies from financial annihilation.

**Step 2: Smear Campaigns by Short Sellers**

**The Attack**:  
With stocks reeling, short-selling vultures like the now-defunct Hindenburg Research swoop in, spewing venomous reports that falsely accuse companies of fraud or mismanagement to cash in on their short positions. These slanderous hit pieces, froth with lies, ignite panic selling and vaporize stock values overnight. For example, Luckin Coffee was obliterated after Muddy Waters accused the company of fraudulent sales in 2020, leading to a NASDAQ delisting (Wikipedia). Innocent companies are often slaughtered by this vicious defamation.

**US\~Observer‚Äôs Counterstrike**:  
We shred these deceitful reports with ruthless accuracy, blasting out hard-hitting rebuttals that expose the short sellers‚Äô filthy motives and restore investor trust. Tesla, for instance, survived short seller attacks through sheer, yet very expensive grit‚Äîour relentless expos√©s ensure other companies can do the same, stopping the cycle before lawsuits erupt. The US\~Observer is the only force that can neutralize this poison and keep your company alive.

**Step 3: Class Action Lawsuits**

**The Attack**:  
As stocks plummet, bloodthirsty attorneys pounce, filing baseless class action lawsuits alleging misrepresentation based on short seller lies. These legal onslaughts bleed companies dry and shred their reputations. For example, Enron‚Äôs 2001 bankruptcy, though fraudulent, shows how lawsuits can seal a company‚Äôs doom. Nikola Corporation was hammered by suits after Hindenburg‚Äôs 2020 report, worsening its financial agony (Rosen Law Firm).

**US\~Observer‚Äôs Counterstrike**:  
The US\~Observer arms companies with ironclad evidence of market manipulation, obliterating baseless lawsuits before they take root. We expose the attorneys‚Äô greed-driven schemes, shielding issuers from this predatory carnage. Only the US\~Observer can stop this legal slaughter, sparing companies the financial ruin that leads to collapse.

**Step 4: Regulatory Pile-Ons**



**The Attack**:  
Regulators, deceived by short seller lies and lawsuits, unleash investigations and fines that can be fatal. For example, Nikola Corporation was slammed with a $125 million SEC settlement in 2021, fueling its 2025 bankruptcy (SEC Press Release). Life Partners Holdings was crushed by a $46.9 million SEC fine, sealing its 2016 demise. The real villains‚Äîshort sellers‚Äîoften slink away unscathed.

**US\~Observer‚Äôs Counterstrike**:  
We turn the tables, forcing the SEC, DOJ, and FINRA to target the true predators with hard evidence of hedge fund and short seller manipulation. Our nationwide newspaper and online platform‚Äôs damning publicity makes regulators back off, avoiding confrontations with us. The US\~Observer is the only shield against this regulatory massacre.

**What to Do When Your Company Has Been Naked Shorted**

If your company is targeted by naked short selling, you‚Äôre in a fight for survival. The¬†**only option**¬†is to contact the US\~Observer immediately. With our 30-year expertise, we deliver unmatched investigative support, advocacy, and strategic guidance to crush this crisis and ensure your company‚Äôs survival. While we lead the charge, follow these steps:

1. **Contact the**¬†[**US\~Observer**](https://usobserver.com/contact/): Unleash our relentless expertise to expose and destroy short-selling manipulation. We are your only lifeline.
2. **We Monitor Trading Activity**: Track short interest and failure-to-deliver (FTD) rates for signs of illegal shorting. Spikes scream manipulation.

Without the US\~Observer‚Äôs iron grip on this fight, your company faces annihilation. Act now or lose everything.

**Hindenburg Research‚Äôs Demise**

Hindenburg Research, a notorious short-selling firm, was obliterated in January 2025, as reported by Reuters and Al Jazeera. Founder Nate Anderson, overwhelmed by the relentless pressure of his own game, shut down after targeting Carvana in their final report (Wikipedia). Their collapse signals the tide turning against predatory short sellers, but the war rages on.

**Conclusion**

The four-step assault‚Äînaked short selling, smear campaigns, class action lawsuits, and regulatory pile-ons‚Äîis a bloodthirsty machine built to slaughter public companies for profit. Examples like Bear Stearns, Luckin Coffee, and Nikola Corporation were torn apart, while [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) and Tesla fought back with savage resistance. The US\~Observer, led by Michael Quiel‚Äîa 35-year investment banking titan who crushed the DOJ in 2024, proving they lied‚Äîis the¬†**only lifeline**¬†capable of annihilating this cycle at every stage. Our 30-year track record proves we‚Äôve obliterated 80% of these attacks, often in the shadows. When exposure is inevitable, we name the predators‚Äîhedge funds, short sellers, and attorneys‚Äîand ensure they face justice. Without the US\~Observer, your company is defenseless. Early intervention is your only shot to survive this carnage and protect your shareholders‚Äô wealth. When predators strike, we are the ultimate weapon.

In the savage, cutthroat jungle of financial markets, public companies are ruthlessly hunted by a vicious four-step assault crafted to annihilate their value and hurl them into bankruptcy. This merciless cycle begins with¬†**naked short selling**, a despicable, illegal tactic that drowns the market in counterfeit shares, followed by venomous smear campaigns, baseless class action lawsuits, and devastating regulatory pile-ons. Predatory hedge funds, short-selling vultures along with the now-defunct Hindenburg Research, and greedy ambulance-chasing attorneys orchestrate this slaughter, raking in profits while shareholders and issuers are left bleeding. As examples, companies like Bear Stearns and Luckin Coffee were crushed under this onslaught, while [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) clawed its way out through unrelenting and extremely expensive resistance. The US\~Observer, led by CEO Michael Quiel with a battle-hardened 30-year track record, is the¬†**only lifeline**¬†capable of obliterating this cycle at every stage.

**Step 1: Naked Short Selling**

**The Attack**:  
The massacre starts with naked short selling, where ruthless hedge funds sell shares they haven‚Äôt borrowed or confirmed, spitting in the face of SEC Regulation SHO (Investopedia). This floods the market with ‚Äúphantom‚Äù shares, gutting stock prices and strangling a company‚Äôs ability to raise capital. For example, Bear Stearns was battered by short selling in 2008, hastening its collapse into a JPMorgan Chase fire sale.

1mcmcj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1mcmcj6/has_anyone_here_disinvited_someone_from_a_wedding/,Has anyone here disinvited someone from a wedding after sending a save the date?,"Hi everyone,

Planning this wedding has been a real journey and full of learning. My fianc√© and I live in Europe, and from the beginning we wanted a small and budget-conscious wedding, partly because we‚Äôre paying for everything ourselves and would rather save for our future. Originally, we planned for about 35 guests, but as of now we‚Äôre at 48 adults plus a child. So while it‚Äôs still small, it‚Äôs a bit more than we expected, and yes, the budget is tight.

One of the hardest parts has been the guest list. There‚Äôs one particular case that‚Äôs really bothering me: a former co-worker. While we saw each other sometimes and went out for coffee or lunch, I was always the one initiating contact. When I mentioned I was getting married, she invited herself to the wedding. I didn‚Äôt feel good about it, but I felt obligated, so I sent her and her boyfriend (which I didn‚Äôt know), the save the date.

We were part of a friend trio, but honestly, she and the other friend are much closer to each other than to me. I‚Äôve often felt like a third wheel in that friendship.

Things got worse when I met her boyfriend (who just moved here). At a party where I was trying to be warm and inclusive, she made some mean-spirited and inappropriate comments about me, completely out of place. It hurt. Still, I tried to be mature and addressed it directly with her. She said it was a joke, apologized, and I left it at that. But honestly, things have not been the same since. That was in June, and we haven‚Äôt spoken or made any effort to see each other since, on either side.

So now, I‚Äôm left feeling really uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt want to spend a very important, intimate day with someone whose presence gives me bad energy, especially when we‚Äôre putting so much effort into making this special with no family financial support. It feels wrong to go through with it just because I sent a save the date.

To complicate it further, if I uninvite her, I feel like I‚Äôd also have to uninvite the mutual friend, and I‚Äôm afraid that could create drama in our social circles, especially since we all work in international environments where word spreads fast. I don‚Äôt want to seem rude or immature‚Ä¶ but at the same time, it‚Äôs my wedding, and I want to feel surrounded by people who truly love and support us.

I thought about waiting a bit longer to see if the friendship naturally fades, but I‚Äôm scared of running out of time. Best case scenario would be that we are still friends and I don‚Äôt regret the list. 

So I guess my question is:
Has anyone here disinvited someone from a wedding after sending a save the date?
How did you do it?

Examples like Bear Stearns, Luckin Coffee, and Nikola Corporation were torn apart, while [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) and Tesla fought back with savage resistance. The US\~Observer, led by Michael Quiel‚Äîa 35-year investment banking titan who crushed the DOJ in 2024, proving they lied‚Äîis the¬†**only lifeline**¬†capable of annihilating this cycle at every stage. Our 30-year track record proves we‚Äôve obliterated 80% of these attacks, often in the shadows. When exposure is inevitable, we name the predators‚Äîhedge funds, short sellers, and attorneys‚Äîand ensure they face justice. Without the US\~Observer, your company is defenseless. Early intervention is your only shot to survive this carnage and protect your shareholders‚Äô wealth. When predators strike, we are the ultimate weapon.

I have been looking for a picture book (I think for children, but could have been a coffee table sort of book) that depicted famous American figures. It was published in the 90s/2000s. I feel like it was Scholastic, but I could be way off. It covered authors, musicians, military leaders, religious leaders, criminals, etc... in particular I remember the picture they had of the KKK (that scared the crap out of me), Al Capone, Harriet Tubman, Janis Joplin, F. Scott Fitzgerald and President Eisenhower when he was a general. It had barely any text, usually just the names of the figures by them. They were all just arranged on each page by what kinds of figures the were (for example, criminals had Billy the Kid and Al Capone and the KKK) kind of like a group portrait ala Beatles album cover of Sgt. Pepper.

The front cover I believe had the Statue of Liberty on the front, and a winding river on the back cover. It was a fairly big picture book, very long horizontally.

 For some reason, America the Beautiful and This Land Is Your Land stick out as potential titles in my head, but I have tried to look for books with that title to no avail. I have gone crazy trying to find this book since it's only 25-30 years old, I would think it would be easy enough to find online.

I was never super close with this particular friend. They were a part of my friend group in high school and we would hang out as a group fairly often but I did not hang out with this friend one on one or text them. When we graduated high school we kind of lost touch and I only saw them at holiday parties or weddings. 

A couple years ago I saw them at a wedding and we kind of reconnected. I genuinely like them as a person and I wanted to try and grow our friendship more. We got dinner one night, we started texting a bit more.. They started to send me coffee (they live across the country in an area known for its coffee) because they knew I loved coffee. I sent them Christmas cookies I baked once but I always felt bad because they would send me coffee fairly often and I never knew what to send them in return. When I asked what they would want/like they would never give me an answer. 

Anyway, this was all fairly short lived. Eventually I stopped hearing from them, we stopped texting, etc. We defaulted back to how our friendship was before. This happened at least 2 years ago. I haven't really heard anything from them since. 

I was hanging out with other friends from high school this weekend when they brought up the wake they went to for this friend's mother. This was the first time I even heard that their mom died. Apparently around Christmas 2025 their mom was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of cancer and died in February 2025. I am so sad for my friend. No one had told me this was going on. I feel so terrible for not knowing. 

Its so difficult and so much to process, I am not mad at my friend for not contacting me. I am annoyed at my other HS friends for not informing me. I don't have social media so there was no way to find out that way. I consider some people who went to the wake close friends and they never brought it up.Those that lived in the area went to the wake. I live about 2 hours away. If I knew about the wake I would have made the drive to attend but I had no idea. 

So now it's been over 4 months since their mom died. How do I send my condolences? Do I send a text? A card? Do I even bother at at all??

I try to picture how I would feel if I was in their shoes and I'm torn. On one hand, I personally wouldn't expect someone I'm not *that* close with to know and I think I would appreciate the condolences. But On the other hand I could see myself being a bit annoyed because they never asked how I was doing this entire time. 

For the record, this has been a huge wake up call to me. I have been feeling like I have been becoming more and more of a recluse the past 1-2 years. This weekend was a wake up call about how disconnected I have become. Maybe I've been a bit depressed.

Whether its complaining about their machine or complaining about the espresso. Am I the only one who is extremely happy with the machine and the drinks it makes?

I think some of you all have done literally ZERO research about how to make a proper espresso. You just want to set it and forget it. Do your research. I weighed everything today, it gave me exactly 18 grams of grounds for my double, and gave exactly 40  GRAMS (my bad) ounces of espresso, which is a 1:2.2 ratio which is considered a standard double shot. Weigh things, time the pours, etc. and that will help you dial it in. You dont have to go with the recommended setting, so if its pouring too fast, go with a finer grind, or vise versa. 

I've made double shots, mochas, lattes, cold brews and they have all turned out great. I consider myself a bit of a coffee snob, but not enough to spend thousands on a fancy espresso setup, but I am very impressed by this machine so far.",4,1753820098.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,10,0.75,False
1mcm77m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mcm77m/could_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop_coffee_maker/,Could the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ coffee maker review convince you it's worth it?,"The **Nespresso ENV92BCA Vertuo Pop+ Coffee Maker and Espresso Machine, Licorice Black** has been my daily brewing companion, and I have plenty to share about its design, performance, and quirks. As someone who savors multiple coffee styles throughout the day, this machine truly caters to variety in a compact, stylish package. While it's not without its flaws, it's a solid addition to any caffeine enthusiast's kitchen.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Compact Design**  
The Vertuo Pop+ is a feast for the eyes with its Licorice Black glossy exterior. Its sleek, modern design is so compact (14""D x 8.6""W x 10.4""H) that it fits snugly on my already cluttered countertop without taking up excessive room. The lightweight build‚Äîjust under eight pounds‚Äîmakes it surprisingly easy to move or tuck into a tight spot. Despite its small footprint, it doesn‚Äôt compromise on creating a high-quality coffee experience. I also appreciate that it comes in eight stylish colors, offering more customization depending on your kitchen decor.

**Exceptional Versatility for All Coffee Cravings**  
This coffee maker covers a broad spectrum of needs with its ability to brew six different coffee sizes, spanning from Ristretto to Cold Brew styles. Whether I feel like indulging in a robust espresso shot or brewing a full mug to kick off my workday, the machine delivers consistency. The fully automatic, one-button brewing process couldn‚Äôt be simpler, which was a lifesaver on hectic mornings when my toddler decided he had *a lot* to say. Thankfully, the operation mode, which relies on an easy button interface, isn't overly complicated‚Äîeven my technology-averse dad figured it out in minutes.

[Check Nespresso ENV92BCA price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c3p9p7b3/)

**Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Smart Connectivity**  
The integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capability of this machine is a surprising bonus. Using these technologies, the Vertuo Pop+ updates its software automatically for the newest brewing options and recipes. This ensures I‚Äôm always enjoying coffee with peak potential‚Äîbut to be honest, the setup process felt a bit unnecessary. It‚Äôs a neat feature, but not one I‚Äôve found myself using every day. 

**Highlights**  
- Compact size fits practically anywhere.  
- Offers six customizable coffee sizes, from espresso to cold brew.  
- One-touch automatic brewing is highly intuitive.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Smart connectivity setup feels overly complex for those who aren't tech-savvy.  
- Capsules can be expensive compared to ground coffee options.  
- Limited coffee input compatibility (capsules only).

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Here‚Äôs where it truly shines: the brewing quality is outstanding. The machine gets every cup right with its capsule technology, producing rich, crema-topped brews every single time. While I‚Äôm usually a die-hard coffee purist, even the flavored capsule varieties won me over! The extraction process ensures every last drop of flavor is utilized, delivering coffee that‚Äôs superior to what I‚Äôd expect from most single-serve coffee makers. However, the capsules do feel steeply priced, and unless you commit to Nespresso-branded pods, there‚Äôs no room for alternative options like reusable pods or loose grounds.

**Drawbacks**  
- Capsule exclusivity means you‚Äôre locked into their ecosystem.  
- Price per brew can rack up quickly if you‚Äôre having three or more coffees a day.  

**Peer Products**  
Compared to competitors like the Keurig K-Elite or the De'Longhi Dedica Espresso Machine, this product blends the best of both worlds. While the Keurig offers a higher variety of input options (including ground coffee), it doesn‚Äôt match the Vertuo Pop+'s flavor consistency or crema production. De'Longhi, on the flip side, excels at precise espresso-making, but lacks the versatility of brewing different sizes and styles with one touch. Ultimately, what sets the Nespresso apart is its balance of simplicity, compactness, and taste quality. One area where Keurig excels, however, is in offering reusable filters‚Äîgreat for those who want to be more eco-conscious.

**True Value**  
In terms of cost efficiency, this machine rides the line between luxury and affordability. While it doesn‚Äôt come with the budget-friendliness of drip coffee makers or machines built for loose grounds, it also doesn‚Äôt veer into the ultra-high luxe pricing you‚Äôd find with more advanced espresso systems. If you value convenience, a solid coffee experience, and a machine that you can count on for both daily brews *and* entertaining guests, then this is a worthwhile investment.
