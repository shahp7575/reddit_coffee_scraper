I got used to mine and during worktime I fight it with coffee, standing up and short walks, task change, face washing, etc... but I changed jobs recently and in my new position I have 2-3  VERY long meetings a week in which I have to stay passively-aware for long times listening to colleagues. Last week an sleepiness episode was so strong that I fell completely asleep and my boss caught me off-guard with a direct question regarding my project and the theme being presented...

Any ideas/tools in this situations?

I had coffee 1h in advance and was early in the morning, so I was supposedly prepared. And also I would very, very, much avoid farma or drugs...

I'm M23, student, unemployed, weed and porn addicted, with suicidal depression and with some kind of neuro divergence (most likely ADHD). I have never been in a real relationship and still a virgin. The only time I kissed a girl, was when I was 16. We kept in contact too, but with her being from South America and me a poor working class European, I guess it wasn't ment to be. I long for a romantic relationship but I can't get myself to even go on a date. Because I am so fcking scared of it. I don't have money because of my weed addiction so I couldn't even give out a coffee if I wanted to. I am overweight 185cm 110kg, even though everyone tells me it's barely noticeable due to my good body type. I hate my body though. That's because I heard so many times ""if I had your genetics I wouldn't ever leave the gym!"". And I hate to hear it, bc I only think about how that body is tied to my broken mind. I used to be a straight A student and now I barely pass my exams (when I even care to write one). My parents send me 70€ a week which is a lot of money for them. Only for me to use 30€ of it on weed. Which makes me feel even more shit. But I can't stand the withdrawal symptoms, so I do it nonetheless. I started smoking weed during the pandemic because I had shit to do, and meeting with my buddies for a joint during the night, was the only thing to do during lockdown. My depression started in high school, my suicidal thoughts started in Elementary when I got bullied for being too ""emotional"". I had to move from my town into the big city for university, and I feel lonely all the time, bc I live on my own and if it isn't for weed, groceries or Uni I won't ever leave my appartement. The loneliness also fuels my porn addicted hard. I have friends in this city here, but I hate always having to reach out. I get along very well at the start of people, but I guess my personality can be tiring over time. At least for people that aren't neurodivergent too. I can't find a psychologist, because, most told me to go rehab before it. But if I don't finish my studies somewhat in time, my parents that are old, won't get to go into retirement in time... And weed motivates me enough to do stuff for uni. 

I will just point out what people generally told me they like about me: my sincerety (mostly that), my cooking. Me being a nerd and fairly intelligent, so I know something about basically every subject, so people enjoy listening and talking to me. My head is always beyond the clouds, means I always live in my own world and whenever I daydream (which happens regularly) people tell me I'm extremely funny. I am extremely kind and will always try my best for everyone to feel involved, when doing any group activity. I also have special connection to animals.

I could go on forever tbh about the bad things. But yeah I feel constantly like shit and hate myself for the things stated above. I still long for a romantic relationship and here longs my biggest fear. Because my mind is so broken and fcked up, I fear a relationship, with anyone, will break them as much as I am broken. And I feel like it's the main reason that is holding me back from even going on a date. I just wished... I don't even know what I'm wishing for. 
To anyone reading this till the end, thank you for your companionship. Also English is only my third language, so I'm sorry for any mistakes. 

TLDR: I hate myself and feel miserable all the time. I have an entire DINA4 page full of psychological problems, which won't get solved any time soon. I wish for a romantic relationship bc I feel lonely a lot and at the same time it's one of the things I fear the most. ",1,1737295533.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I'm planning a trip to Annecy this summer with my family (2 adults + a 2-year-old) and would love some advice—your help is much appreciated!

1. We’re flexible with the timing but would like to avoid the peak crowds while still having the lake warm enough for swimming. I was thinking about late August—does that make sense? When do French families with school-aged kids typically finish their vacation season?
2. We’re planning to stay for about two weeks. We enjoy biking, light hiking (as much as possible with a toddler), and just relaxing with a nice coffee. Do you think Annecy has enough to offer for two weeks? We’ll likely have a car, so we’d be up for exploring nearby areas within about an hour’s drive. Any recommendations? I’ve heard Lac d’Aiguebelette is nice—would it be worth a visit?
3. Also, where would you recommend staying around the lake? We’d prefer to minimize driving and be close to restaurants, beaches, and other amenities.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1737295317.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

- Fair skinned, slim, and on the tall side

- Around 28-35 yo, single, unattached to anyone, never married, and no kid/s
- At least 5'9 and on the slim/slim fit side also
- I'm usually smitten by smart/nerdy looking guys hehe but it's really the wit and substance that keeps me interested
- Big big plus if with a nice and manly speaking voice
- Hopefully we share the same hobby/hobbies or maybe we can introduce each other to new stuff

You can also make fruit juice gummies with gelatin, if you don't like having bone broth or coffee every day. Gelatin also helps contribute to your overall protein intake.

","Based in England. Im in a fixed term tenancy agreement for 12 months with a 6 month break clause. I've been here 5 weeks, landlord is a nightmare but due to financial reasons (costs of moving etc) and health issues at present, I'm tolerating it. I know this is just one of those unlucky events where I'm stuck with a slum landlord as I've ended up chatting to the former tenant and going on coffee dates with her, so I was made aware that most of my issues where pre-existing ones (issues with boiler, broken panels, uncertified contractors, basically family members trying to make repairs on boilers). 

Originally she tried to terminate my lease less than a month in ""due to my health issues"", when I asked for her to get the window seals looked at, as they had perished, the window glass unit was cracked and it was impossible to heat the flat, cold air was constantly flooding in and to get an engineer to come look at the boiler as her ""contractor"" (aka family member) had not set it up or fixed the timer properly (had no water first 4 days of moving in, then limited hot water after this until 10 days ago). I told her I'd think about her suggestion and let her know, this was all done via text. 

We have an additional room in the property she is trying to fill. she advertised the place as for 2 people max, with no couples. But she's overpriced the room, so she decided to start accepting couples. I asked if my rent would be recalculated based on the property being a 3 person share rather than two. So she decided to initiate the break clause, stating she had changed it to a month later (over text) because that is when a property managment company would be taking over it and renting the flat at as a whole unit instead of per room. I reminded her that the break clause would be May but was happy to extend until June, or terminate earlier on the basis I found somewhere else so she could rent the flat out as a whole property as she was struggling to fill second room on the agreement of both of us etc. She said she'd send the new contract over and never did, this was only a few days ago so assumed she was busy with work etc. 

Today, she's decided that she's putting the termination date back to May. I'm losing my mind with this landlord. I accepted June, was awaiting her contract amendments. Now she is saying that she needs the extra month to fill in the holes (there are no holes) because she has sold the property to a buyer. In 4 days!?

I want to terminate in June, which I accepted only a few days ago over text (I've screenshotted it) as an amendment and was awaiting the contract for. I'm going to try to contact citizens advice/shelter this week. She has been trying to call me/rage texting me all morning and I've asked her to give me a few days to look into things. 

Can anyone shed any advice on this? The current break clause on the contract is May (6 months from Dec move in) but I haven't been served any official section 21 eviction notice either, and have the conversation of me saying I was happy to extend until June. 

Thanks in advance 🙏

https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1021132/x/d3f8dc26bd/purified-water-quality-report-022417.pdf

So it appears that the bottled water delivery I get has TDS of 5 and PH 6.0. 

While I’ve experimented and had had a lot of variables change lately as a result of trying to narrow down my brews one thing that’s remained the same is the water.

I either do 15/250 or an 18/300 for the wife. 

Grind sizes on burr lock Zp6 are right now between 5.0-6.0

Water Temp: 200f

Methods tried: v60 Hoffman & CC Switch recipe

Beans Brewed: 

1. Bean&Bean Santa Felisa Gesha, Washed,  98-18 (Rested 30+ days)

2. Wilton Benitez Gutemala Decaf (Rested 9 days, how long it was sitting at coffee shop)

3. Onyx Tio Conejo Gesha , Natural, Rested 18 days)


My brews as of recent have all basically tasted the same across different beans. Notes come through in the coffee from a smell perspective but everything is muted. Not bad, sour, astringent or bitter but lacking sweetness/flavor which is desired.


I don’t want to have to do TWW packets, considering just trying tap to start which should contain higher TDS?

1i4yo4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1i4yo4a/tip_pool_issues/,Tip Pool Issues,"I work as a barista captain at a member's club (NYC) and I have been trying to change how we distribute our tip pool for months. 

The way the pool was set up prior to the business opening was through a point system. Bartenders get 40, Servers get 40, and Baristas get 20. However due to the nature of the business we ended up not having a server team unless events were held in the space. Majority of service work is done by baristas and bartenders. The expectations of the roles are the same as baristas are expected to know how to bartend and bartenders are expected to make coffee and non alcoholic drinks. 

I have been petitioning to split the point system 50/50 baristas and bartenders as we don't really have servers. However I was told by the food and bev director the FOH team must vote unanimously on this shift in the pool distribution. 

Our events coordinator (her hourly is $25) is in the tip pool. She is considered the manager of the server team as well (which no longer exists). She mainly works from home, or if at the space she is on a laptop. During an event she will set up self service stations and act more like a catering manager as the events don't really require much actual serving.  She is in the pool for the 40 point share and since she is a team of 1 she isn't splitting those tips at all. She refuses to allow us to split the tips in a more even way (I suggested 33/33/33 since she insists on being in the pool). 

Our bar manager is also in the pool (her hourly is $27) and will regularly schedule herself alongside another bartender.  She will then be on the computer doing clerical work while we do the service labor. However she still gets to be in the tip pool.  

This results in incredibly high pay disparities between employees. Baristas regularly take home $450-$550 a week while working on average 24-32 hours a week whereas the bar manager and event coordinator take home around $950-$1200 a week for around 20-24 hours of labor that includes working from home and admin work. 

I am wondering if the bar manager and events coordinator are even tip eligible especially due to the nature of the work they do (which is rarely interfacing with the customer) and how much they are paid an hour. Also it is my understanding that event coordinators typically don't even get tips. 

Not really sure how to proceed in terms of advocating for the barista team or what kind of recourse we have if any. ",3,1737294067.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

For some context, my mother isn't native to this country. She came when she was a young woman and met my father, eventually settling to live in the country we currently reside in. For anonymity purposes, I will not be disclosing any personal information about our family.

To get straight to the point, my parents met a couple (husband and wife) around 3 months ago but have only gotten more close around a month and a half ago. The wife is from the same country as my mother and the husband spent a lot of his life over there as well. In short, my mother can communicate with them not just as friends but also culturally. However something happened last night which struck us as a bit strange.

My parents went over with my younger siblings in the evening to their house for a cup of coffee and tea just to spend some time together. At around 10pm the husband recommended to my parents that my younger siblings stay the night in the spare bedroom and we can go to collect them in the morning. This, as I'm sure you can tell, was very strange as we've only become closer with them less than 2 months ago and they already want to host my siblings for the night? It's important to note that the wife has a son however he's 18 years old and has already left for college. Besides him they have no other children. Perhaps it might make sense if they had younger children similar ages to my siblings but obviously, that isn't the case.

Furthering the point, they've already offered for myself and my older sibling to stay at the house earlier on in the family friendship but this in itself was strange. This is odd to us as people we've known for most of our life (my godmother for example) have only had us stay over at their house once in our lives. 

So please, can you give us some advice on how to proceed? We feel (my parents and I) that now things that once seemed innocent are in actual fact not and how are we suppose to deal with this? Sorry for any spelling mistakes, this has not been proofread.",1,1737294060.0,Concerned,0,1.0,False

Theyre my babies. But I've always loved being able to sit with a cup of coffee and watch their antics. What if others like to do this too? You come in, have a cup of coffee and be entertained by the fluffy cuteness that are cats. Maybe read a book too, as I'm an avid reader myself - that is until a little furry butt plops on your book demanding attention! 

That said, I can bring the cats to the idea. But I don't have a location, nor the money to do it on my own. If anyone participates it would have to be locally and they'd have to accept that my word is law regarding my little ones. 

My idea is simple, albeit slightly complex. A cat cafe, a book store, a coffee house. Maybe enlven a place so sell cat supplies like treats, toys and clothing - if you can keep it on your cat that is! 

So, anyone who has advice is welcome to comment. Don't hate and please don't steal ideas. Anyone wanting to participate, please comment. I think this could be a real great business model that others could utilize.

These last 3 months have been the hardest period of my life. It was mostly bad days, with occasional good day for the first two months but after some therapy and a lot of talking, last month was mostly good days with occasional bad days. 

I don't know what happened yesterday, but I started to break down. I had intrusive thoughts and mind films more vivid then at the beginning of the process. I couldn't hold it, I couldnt stop my mind, I started to cry and broke down completely. We had a 3 hour long talk about everything and it caused even more pain on both side. I said some things I shouldn't have, and she was crying and was overwhelmed with guilt. It was one of the most painful conversation we ever had. The brake up was on the table. I couldn't see myself ever forgiving her for what she's done. I couldn't see the future and the family with the person who hurt me so much, dispute the fact that she is changing and is doing everything to fix this. 

After 3 hours of hard talk we calmed down and went to bed. I hugged her and we fell asleep almost immediately because we were exhausted. We woke up still hugging. This is the first time this happened because we both move a lot during sleep. We haven't moved, we were hugging all night. As soon as I woke up I remembered the talk and the pain started to come up again. But when I looked at her I suddenly felt love. I felt that I love her more than anything in this world and I remembered why I am doing this. I remembered that she is not a bad person but deeply traumatized and broken girl who loves me. She didn't do what she did to hurt me, she was hurting herself. She didn't know how to cope with her trauma and her upbringing and she developed destructive behavioral patterns. She is remorseful and she wants to change. Not for me, but for herself. She doesn't want to be that person anymore. I realized how much my support means to her at this moment and that she wouldn't be able to do it on her own. I realized that she is still the one I want and I'll be here for her. If we succeed, we will have the strong and meaningful relationship that survived the hardest blow. I love her, and I want her in my life.

I made coffee and breakfast and we now talk about the future and our future family. She reassured me she will never hurt me again and she said she would rather die then see that much pain in my eyes. I realize now that these days will come and that the healing is not linear. I realized that this will be harder then I first thought. But I know why I am staying and why am I doing this. I believe everyone can change and I believe it's worth fighting. I love her so much and I want this to work, but I know that I can leave anytime I want and that gives me freedom. I choose to stay and I'm willingly taking the risk to see if we can fix this. 

If you are having a hard day, just remember that you are not alone, and that this is normal. Remember what you are fighting for and if it's worth fighting for, endure, the peace will come. I wish you all happiness and strength to endure this. We are not alone. We are all in this together. We can do it. ",10,1737293571.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,2,1.0,False

# 4. Tools You Need for DIY Woodworking

The right tools can make or break your woodworking projects. Here’s a list of must-have tools for DIY woodworking:

# Essential Hand Tools

* **Saws**: A basic hand saw or coping saw is needed for cutting wood.

# 5. How to Create Your Own DIY Woodworking Plans

Creating your own woodworking plans can seem daunting, but it’s an incredibly rewarding process. Here are steps to guide you:

1. **Choose the Project Type**: Decide on the complexity of the project and your skill level.
2. **Sketch Your Design**: Make accurate drawings of the project, including dimensions.
3. **Calculate Materials**: Based on the design, calculate how much wood and other materials you’ll need.
4. **Write Step-by-Step Instructions**: Break the process down into clear, actionable steps.

By following these steps, you can create a personalized and detailed woodworking plan to guide you from start to finish.

# 6. Reading Pre-Made Woodworking Plans

If you’re new to woodworking, following pre-made plans can be a great way to learn the ropes. Many woodworking plans are available online, offering detailed diagrams, lists of materials, and step-by-step instructions. It’s important to understand the symbols and measurements used in these plans to avoid confusion.

# 7. Common Mistakes in DIY Woodworking and How to Avoid Them

Even experienced woodworkers encounter mistakes, but beginners often make certain errors more frequently. Here are some common woodworking mistakes and tips on how to avoid them:

# Misjudging Material Sizes

One of the most frequent issues is using materials that are the wrong size, whether it’s cutting wood too short or miscalculating the dimensions. This can lead to wasted materials and frustration.

**Tip**: Always double-check your measurements before cutting, and keep a measuring tape handy for constant reference. If you're unsure about a size, make a dry run with your materials before finalizing cuts.

# Incorrect Measurements and Cuts

Incorrect cuts or poor measurement techniques can ruin a project. A slight mistake in measuring can lead to pieces that don’t fit or misalign during assembly.

**Tip**: Use a square or a carpenter's square to ensure your cuts are straight. Also, when cutting, measure twice to cut once. It's worth spending extra time ensuring accuracy, as small errors can compound quickly.

# Overestimating Skill Level

It’s tempting to take on large, complex projects, but overestimating your skill level can result in frustration and unfinished projects.

**Tip**: Start with simple projects like a small shelf or picture frame to build your skills and gain confidence before moving on to more complicated designs.

# Not Using the Proper Tools or Techniques

Using the wrong tools or improper techniques can lead to sloppy work, or worse, accidents.

**Tip**: Make sure you are using the right tools for the job. For instance, a circular saw is great for straight cuts, but it won’t help with intricate curves. Understand the function of each tool, and use it as intended.

# 9. Advanced DIY Woodworking Projects

As you become more proficient, you may want to challenge yourself with larger and more intricate projects. Here are a few advanced woodworking ideas:

# Furniture Building

Building your own furniture is an impressive and rewarding challenge. You could start with basic pieces like chairs, side tables, or coffee tables. As your skills grow, you can attempt more complex items like cabinets or sectional sofas.

Custom cabinets allow you to design storage solutions specific to your needs. This could involve designing intricate doors, shelves, or drawers. Building cabinetry involves advanced joinery and precise measurements, but it’s a great way to showcase your skills.

# Outdoor Furniture and Structures

Building outdoor furniture like picnic tables, Adirondack chairs, or even garden benches requires materials that withstand the elements. These projects can be more complex and require durable finishes, but they are a great way to improve your woodworking abilities.

# 10. Sustainability in DIY Woodworking

More woodworkers are focusing on sustainability in their craft, using eco-friendly materials and practices. Here’s how to incorporate sustainability into your woodworking:

# Using Reclaimed Wood

Reclaimed wood from old furniture, pallets, or construction sites is a great way to reduce waste. Not only is it an environmentally friendly choice, but it also adds character to your projects. The unique textures and patinas of reclaimed wood make each piece one-of-a-kind.

# Eco-Friendly Finishes and Paints

Avoid toxic paints and finishes by opting for low-VOC or non-toxic options. These eco-friendly finishes are safer for you and the environment, and many are just as durable as traditional finishes.

# Minimizing Waste and Reusing Materials

Plan your cuts carefully to minimize waste. Additionally, consider reusing leftover pieces of wood for smaller projects or scraps for decorative accents. By thinking ahead, you can avoid unnecessary material waste.

# 11. Safety Tips for DIY Woodworking

Woodworking can be a rewarding and fulfilling hobby, but it’s crucial to prioritize safety to avoid accidents. Here are some essential safety tips for woodworking:

# Protecting Yourself from Common Accidents

Woodworking tools, especially power tools, can be dangerous if not handled properly. Always keep hands and clothing away from moving parts, and ensure that all tools are turned off when not in use.

# How to Handle Power Tools Safely

Power tools are powerful and efficient but can also be hazardous. Always follow the manufacturer's safety guidelines, wear protective equipment, and make sure the workpiece is securely clamped before starting.

# Workspace Organization and Cleanliness

A clean and organized workspace is critical for both safety and efficiency. Keep tools and materials within easy reach, and clear away any debris or sawdust to avoid tripping hazards.

# 12. Cost of DIY Woodworking Projects

One of the appeals of DIY woodworking is the potential cost savings compared to buying furniture. However, it’s important to budget wisely and plan for material and tool expenses.

# Budgeting for Materials and Tools

The cost of materials varies greatly depending on the type of wood and the complexity of your project. Basic plywood or pine is relatively inexpensive, but hardwoods like oak or cherry can be more costly. Power tools are a bigger investment but will last for years if properly maintained.

# Free and Low-Cost Woodworking Plan Resources

Many websites and woodworking communities offer free plans and advice. Websites like Instructables, Ana White, and Pinterest have a wealth of free resources that can help you get started.

# Saving Money Through DIY Projects

By sourcing materials locally, using reclaimed wood, or choosing simple designs, you can reduce the cost of your projects. Additionally, learning to use basic hand tools can avoid the need for expensive power tools.

# 13. Where to Find Free and Paid Woodworking Plans

Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced woodworker, there are plenty of resources available online to help you find detailed woodworking plans.

# Online Resources

* **Websites**: Platforms like Lumberjocks, Woodworkers Guild of America, and Family Handyman offer both free and paid woodworking plans.
* **Woodworking Blogs**: Many bloggers share free project ideas and step-by-step guides. Some offer downloadable plans in PDF format.

# Woodworking Books and Magazines

Books and magazines often feature step-by-step projects and provide inspiration. Some well-known publications like “Fine Woodworking” or “Popular Woodworking” offer both paid and free plans.

# Local Woodworking Clubs and Classes

Joining a local woodworking club can give you access to shared plans, tools, and advice. Additionally, many woodworking schools and community colleges offer workshops and courses to help you improve your skills.

# 14. How to Improve Your Woodworking Skills

To become an accomplished woodworker, it’s important to continue learning and refining your skills. Here are ways to enhance your woodworking abilities:

# Online Courses and Tutorials

Take advantage of online platforms like YouTube, Udemy, and Skillshare, where woodworking experts share tutorials for every skill level. These courses are often structured and provide practical tips.

# Woodworking Workshops and Mentorships

Consider attending a woodworking class at a local community college or woodworking shop. Workshops are hands-on, and you’ll gain valuable experience while learning from experts.

i met my boyfriend (let’s call him erik) in late november of 2022. i found myself shit swiping on an app after being let down by a man (m35) id had deep feelings for for about 2 years since the pandemic (let’s call him alan). 

i met alan through a mutual friend, they both worked together at one of the more better known restaurants in my city. i would go in almost weekly to visit my friend who happened to be the bar tender and i got to know alan very well. 

alan is hard to read and mysterious, and i have always loved that. we connected on things like books, music, film. we would have no issue staying up together all night to talk about life and things like that. i had always had deep feelings for him, but i couldn’t ever really tell how he felt about me or what he was looking for and was too pus*y to ask. he’d always asked my friend about me when i would go more than a week without visiting, text me to check in etc. but i don’t know that he is the relationship type. 

in late november of 2022 he finally asked me on an actual date. we had planned it out and then the day of it was radio silent. i live in the midwest and there was a brutal snow storm so while i understood and assumed we wouldn’t be going out that night / communication goes a long way. i finally around midnight texted him asking if he was alright. he responded apologetic (and seemingly intoxicated) letting me know he’d had to travel north a few hours to his parents to help with their farm given the snow storm due to his dads recent hip replacement. i knew about his dads surgery, and of course would have been fine with this - what i wasn’t cool with was him not communicating. 

i did not reply. i did not tell him how it made me feel. i instead downloaded a dating app and sought out validation that way. 

the next day i matched with my current partner, erik. 

erik and i texted for about two weeks leading up to our first hangout. i admittedly did hangout with Alan once or twice during this. once for my birthday because he was a part of planning it alongside my friends - and we were admittedly intimate together during this time. 

erik and i kept texting and finally hungout. he was nice, cute and different than the guys i usually go for. we did not have many interests in common but we felt more alike in our souls, and really in alignment with long term goals. 

erik told me he had been in a four year relationship that ended in march of 2022. he let me know she left him with no warning. he came home from work one day and she was just gone. this hurt me for him because he seemed to be a really great guy and i don’t think anyone should experience a relationship loss in that way. 

as things progressed with erik, i stopped replying to alan. erik was proactive in saying he wanted to be with me and only me, something alan didn’t ever communicate. 

so eventually i was pretty much exclusively seeing erik. and then things went south. 

it was probably late february and one of erik’s interests is mountain biking which we’d done some easy intro rides as i wanted to see if it was for me. he had me download an app called strava used to track rides - kind of facebook for sports. i went to follow him and i was pretty much immediately wrecked. i see that the girl he used to date and he were doing rides together in late october - not long before i met him. 

i of course said something to him about it. and he got extremely defensive and acted like id done something criminal in looking at his profile when i was genuinely just curious about where he’d gone and how much riding he did. 

he let me know they officially split at the end of october but things started to be very bad in march and that’s why he told me that…. im pretty upset - no universe would i have willingly started to try and seriously date someone who was ONE MONTH out of a four year relationship. 

i let him talk me into being okay with this. 

fast forward another few weeks. things had not been sitting well with me. we were still seeing eachother almost everyday. but it felt off. we were hanging out and he went to take trash out one night and left his phone on the coffee table and i saw his ex text him. i don’t love what i did but i opened the phone and read the texts. they were very much still in constant communication saying they love and miss eachother. he begging her to come over to cook her dinner etc. 

i left. i said nothing. i got my things and left before he got back with the trash. 

when he got back and noticed i was gone he kept calling me trying to figure out what happened. i finally answered and said what i saw and he started to laugh at me and say he wasn’t texting her. then when i told him i unlocked his phone and read their messages he went silent for a few. he told me finally he was trying to get her to come get the rest of her stuff from his house (there was so much and it was something that made me uncomfortable and i voiced that multiple times).  he swore there would be no more. i believed him and kept seeing him. 

in another few weeks things just kept getting worse. it’s probably early april and i caught them riding bikes together. i stopped all communication. we did not talk for over a month. 

he reaches out to me apologetic and basically begging for another chance. says he never got closure with her and she wouldn’t clean break things and it was hard for him after that much time with her. i get that because i’ve been in a similar situation. we meet up for dinner and talk and he seems really genuine so we ease back into things. 

during that month i hung out with alan a few times- nothing serious but we did hangout and it was nice. 

after we (me and erik) have eased back into things we both have leases ending and i made the biggest mistake of my life. we moved in together. 

things were good for awhile - and then his ex starts texting him. asking him to buy her a phone. she starts riding her bike by our house. she starts deflating my side of the sleep number bed every night to 0. it’s a lot. 

i have had multiple suspicions of them still talking. some dating as recent as may of 2024. we went to snowshoe wv for a bike trip. are at dinner having a great time looking at pics. i ask to send myself one. i hit the message button. her name is first on the options meaning recent communication. i freak the fuck out. i open his messages and there’s just one message from her and it’s very responsive in nature and she acknowledges where we are at. i don’t understand what is happening i basically black out. i call her from my phone and she won’t answer. i text her. nothing. he says she must have seen a post and knew where we were and is trying to mess with us. that just feels insane. to this day i don’t believe it. it hurts me everyday to think about. 

shortly after this we go out one night and we get not into an argument over it but i bring it up and say i can’t stop focusing on it and he gets upset. he doesn’t come to bed with me. the next morning im still so in my head i go to her strava profile and i see that he liked a post of hers. strava doesn’t let you unlike someone’s post. i confront him. he says….lorddd help me
he says that she hacked his account and liked it…….

i don’t believe him but at this point im so worn down. i don’t know if i even care anymore. 


the issue is that im so dumb and dont leave. months later he surprises me with two puppies. his way of making me stay i assume now looking back. 

i have tried to end things with this man and it doesn’t go well. he becomes emotionally overtaken he is scary. he doesn’t explicitly say it but gives off suici*al vibes. saying he can’t go on without me. no point of life without me. etc. 

i do think he loves me and he wants to be with me. but i think he’s also still chasing closure form this girl. who i can confirm is also insane. his family hates her. she seems terrible. wouldn’t let him even call his family for two years. she had her mom send me a death threat bc i texted her asking to honor girl code and tell me wtf is going on when i saw she texted him in snowshoe. not good vibes. 

some things ive left out. erik has been physical with me in the past. he has choked me and hit me. i have also hit him, however never first and usually as a means to make him stop. he has yelled at me more times than i can count. not allowing me to speak. 

last summer after the snowshoe and liking of the post i was done. i decided to be done. i tried to end things and again the hysterics kept me. however i gave the ultimatum of going to therapy or i’m done. and he has gone. three days a week for 6 months now. and it has helped w how he communicates but idk. i don’t feel it. most of anything he says is annoying to me at this point and i have trouble not snapping at him. 

i do love this person. i know that probably sounds really stupid but i do legitimately have love for him in my heart. 

however. i think i spent so much time and energy trying to wait for him to love and want only me that at this point i dont think im in love with him and never will be able to get there. 

to complicate things even further. alan has been texting me a lot lately. i don’t know if he even knows erik exists. alan has no social media, i don’t go out anymore and we don’t see eachother. and i’m not sure my friend he worked with would’ve ever said anything bc she was team me and alan forever. 

he has been very kind. checking in to see
how i’m doing, sending book recommendations, etc. every time he texts me i feel a way i haven’t felt in probably 2 years since we last hung out often. 

i am probably delusional. i’m sure he just wants to be friends. but i really think i still have feelings for him - and stronger feelings than i have for erik. 

i’ve left a lot out of this story because i think i have honestly begun to black some parts of it out. 

i don’t know what to do. i love erik but not in love with him, and idk if im only feeling that way because of the attention alan is giving. i was feeling checked out before the influx in comms from alan started to come in though. 

i could use an outsiders perspective. i think im scared to leave erik and realize i do actually love him and want to marry him etc. 

please tell me what you think as an outsider. what do you think i should do? and i being dumb. 

also to clarify the convos w alan have been very platonic. i’ve not talked about anything inappropriate. genuinely just catching up. i’m sure erik wouldn’t like that but he also had no issue telling his ex he loved her while im next to him on his couch at one point so as shitty as it sounds i don’t think im out of line.

Me and an ex rented an air b and b on a small island just off the coast of where I grew up. I woke up there knowing we rented it but nothing else. It was stormy af. She was MIA. I had no phone and didn’t know what was going on so I swam to shore. There I came to a bluff that was basically a constant landslide. Farther down the beach was a hotel that had access to the beach. Walked in the back of the hotel and found a guest with a large dog who offered to take me to town to find my ‘friends’ after I explained my situation. Found a farmers market and spotted my ex walking a goat. I asked her what was going on and she said ‘getting your birthday supplies, even got you a mask that fits over your horns’. 

More details as they slip away. It was very detailed. Both visually and emotionally. The landslides were flows of small round rocks that were pelting me. The goat was Pygmy and bow legged. Stranger from the hotel was a hippy traveler type. Ex started as an ex gf but became ex wife. It was very stormy, but I didn’t feel in danger.

So, I decided to take my 400 euros and make the most genius investment of 2025—TRUMP COIN. Don’t ask why, just trust the vibes. But when I opened my Revolut app, guess what? No Crypto section. Nada. Poof.

I updated the app, restarted my phone, sacrificed a coffee to the tech gods—still no luck. Support first told me my app wasn’t updated (wrong, I’m on version 10.62), then said I needed to confirm my ID (it’s valid until 2029). Meanwhile, my precious TRUMP COIN is mooning (or so I imagine).

Revolut’s solution? “It’ll take 1-2 business days to resolve.” Oh sure, let me just park my ambition while you sip tea and “raise my case.” Why not just transfer my money back so I can buy TRUMP COIN elsewhere? Nope, apparently that’s too much to ask.

i never did. 

i went about life daily, holding conversations in the middle of them like nothing, working full shifts with no problem, living. on the worst days, i just put audio of people counting so i knew which reality i was in, then continued life again. i guess everyone has their little quirks, mine is no different that i had to do that sometimes and i didn’t really care if i was different anymore. at the end of the day, my hands could still move and i can spell my own name, and that’s enough to work with sometimes.

best of all, i think i feel better. i manage to make them stop now because i had to fully convince myself i was fine. (again, i didn’t fall on the floor yet right?) i just can’t have coffee or alcohol unless in tiny amounts.

maybe there was a pay off. i envied people who were sane and didn’t know what they had. i had a law school exam yesterday and took a huge risk by drinking black coffee, which i don’t really do. felt the onset symptoms coming but i wasn’t scared, put the energy towards the test. the thing about the test was it was timed, (1 min per 100 ish questions) as the timer got closer, no matter what happened i wouldn’t panic like usual. i think i relearned what panic even was. i was really confused on some questions, let the timer count down and decided to put the mouse away and take thirty seconds each time to just sit there, doing nothing. let myself reset, started the question again, still finished with a couple minutes to spare. i work in criminal defense which is a risky job, and don’t freak out when crazy things happen now at work either. i’m rambling and it’s 6am. just thinking about how i have a nice job, did the test fine and feel a little better lately. just wanted to let you all know sometimes it can get better if you work on it and feel that you have an internal locus of control, instead of entirely believing it is out of your hands.

I’ve never dated. Never had a boyfriend except in high school, briefly. My relationship history isn’t great - I have flings with guys I find super attractive in a FWBs way, sometimes I’d get infatuated with them, usually they wouldn’t end great. And those were few and far between. I’m working on myself though, I’ve been in therapy. I’d like to think I’m okay looking - and I’ve recently lost a bunch of weight getting back into exercise and I generally feel okay about my appearance these days. 

I wasn’t interested in dating but a work friend asked to set me up with his buddy and I said why not. 

We went on a coffee date that lasted a few hours. He was kind and we have a lot in common - like weird nerdy niche stuff I can never get my friends into. 

I’m embarrassed to admit my hesitation comes from the physical aspect. There were flashes when I’d look at him and go yeah, he’s a really good-looking dude. He is definitive good looking… just not my type, maybe. I’ve seen older pictures when he used to look my type (think scruffy/long hair). He could also lose weight, I don’t mean to be unkind, but I think the only thing we didn’t have in common was sport/exercise for fun. 

I can only compare this to my previous FWBs - and I’m used to being wildly attracted to these guys. 

With date guy I’m not sure. We’re going to hang out again so I have time.

Does attraction really grow with time? Having fun in the bedroom is important for me. But writing this guy off because I didn’t want to rip his clothes off first date would be a shitty move right? 

I’m embarrassed to turn to the internet but the truth is I feel like I’m just getting to know myself at 32. And I don’t know dating is like or even what I value.

At first, I thought maybe the dose was too high as I was quite manic when it initially set in, but I think that was because I had a coffee on the first day I took meds as I didn’t expect the meds to arrive early (I had gone a day without meds due to my med review being postponed).

These effects quickly subsided and as such, I kept monitoring my BP and HR. They have only increased slightly but are still within the normal range.

I feel very “comfortable” on this dose meaning I’m calm but also productive and know what I have to do.

I feel the dose is lasting the full 14 hours when I consider that it’s meant to improve focus and concentration and reduce impulsivity. And then when it wears off, I feel very calm and relaxed to be able to read a book in bed to go to sleep. I feel my sleep is actually better on the 50mg than the 30mg.

My focus and concentration is SO good. I’m reading info and taking it in very well. When I read my book to go to bed, I am reading at a much quicker pace than before meds BUT actually taking the info in and absorbing it and thinking about it.

My planning and organisational skills are just locked in and well executed. I know what I have to do in my head. I find checklists work for the first time ever… I could never do planning via tables/checklists before meds.

The only annoying symptom I have is I get a warm face which is kinda overstimulating in a way for me. But in this cold weather, it’s not too much of a problem as it means I’m warmer. It’s starting to be less prominent though so I think it’s not that big of an issue as long as I consistently monitor myself.

Appetite is suppressed in the morning but even when the meds are still working in the afternoon, I can eat food and still be hungry which is good for me as I need to put on weight. I plan to go to the gym soon now that I can focus and gain muscle. I will need to eat a lot more food for this.

Regarding social interactions, my friend who is very honest with me and used to hate my interrupting said I’m very thoughtful now and considerate of her feelings and don’t interrupt. I feel like I’m actually listening too. I took meds at 7.45am yesterday and felt like my energy/focus wasn’t subsiding until around 10/11pm. I normally get tired when hanging out with friends, but it was nice to actually give her my full attention. We also ate an Italian restaurant and I managed three courses at around 6/7pm.

If anyone has any questions about it, I’m happy to answer as I know how I felt when I first took my doses 😂 I’m aware that I may feel differently about it in a few weeks, but I sadly can’t do life without meds atm (at least when I’m in full time work) as my energy is drained and my brain is so loud (I never realised how loud it was until my meds quietened it).",0,1737292554.0,ADHDUK,3,0.5,False

I’ve seen this subreddit and contemplated posting a variety of dreams I have (vivid dreamer since childhood, likely due to melatonin, but still) since some are batshit insane and/or really funny. This one, not so much. I’m not new to really graphic nightmares. Though this wasn’t gory or anything (unless you count an ant infestation pretending to be a person in a skin suit, then yes), it was severely uncanny, and I’m still not feeling great from it. Anyway, on with it.

I’m not exactly great with the chronological order of my dreams, so this may hop back and forth (they’re typically a jumbled mess anyhow). I am also very wordy and interrupt myself a lot, as a heads-up. Sorry if it becomes bothersome. But any advice on what the hell this means or says about me would be MUCH appreciated. Thank you in advance for even reading. ((Also hope I used the right flare?

It started with me in this sort of.. liminal upstairs space? I think there were 4-5 rooms minimum, but not much more than that. I could not go downstairs, not for any exact reason, but it was as if it did not exist/my brain did not filter it into reality. The floor was some vague brown/old carpet with off-white walls. There were two windows on each end of the hallway-ish area (or at least one?), except you could not see outside of them. It was just pure white / the concept of sunlight, minus the ability to see past it. So I could see the frame and this “light” but nothing beyond it, almost as if fog were a light source. Very liminal-looking place, in my eyes.

It was initially empty, but it sort of just... Cut to people being there/living there. It was like the foggy idea of a group home or communal home, but with entirely unknown people who just existed as background placements. To my knowledge, all of them were adults(?).

At one point, it turned into this. Weird, almost dating-simulator like thing? I can’t describe it and I know that description isn’t accurate, more like some weird visual novel briefly, but yeah. Some set of people (mostly dudes, though some more androgynous) came in.

One person came in, and there was some conversation my person had with him (I often take a spectator role in my dream that is assigned to a person/people, rarely ever feeling like the person unless it’s an extreme feeling of emotion).

This is the part where I think I mixed dreams / woke up briefly and went back into it or something. The first go-around was.. Bad. I think I ended up killing some of them or all of them. But my brain tends to give me second chances? Typically the opportunity to make things right- or a monster about to get me, and it resets or places me elsewhere so I can keep going. Something about the circumstances made me feel more anxiety over being caught than guilt (unless it’s a specific dream about an abuser, I usually feel a sense of unthinkable fear and/or guilt).

In the “second” timeline, I got another chance to make things right, and I sort of recalled my past life. The vague roommate people were not a part of this / not the people I harmed or interacted with; they merely existed in their own rooms. I knew they were there, but they never really interfered or participated (though in both timelines, I had a worried feeling that they would know what I did).

The people. Weird. Like the concept of a person filtered as a PNG and then back to a person- came round again, and instead of doing whatever I did last time (I have no idea how I harmed them, I think brute force?) I knocked them out and tucked them under the bed (this was happening in a bedroom in the middle of the stairs, so imagine one room in front of the stairs, two or so in the middle, and then one fully on the right, I can draw this up later). This bedroom was mostly empty save for like. Probably some furniture? The bed was really the only thing I noticed. Somehow, it managed to fit three fully grown people under there, and that detail gave me this unnerved feeling.   
  
Except for the fourth / final one (There were also 4-5 of them) I did something that ended up giving them this weirdly slash on their stomach (which Idek why or how was visible, they were all entirely clothed)- I think in the shape of a jagged X mark? Bright red, too, but they did not really seem to bleed at all, as if the blood just stayed stationary in the position of the X, and flowed nowhere else. But they went down and did not get back up. I moved them into the room on the far right (which seemed to be more blue? Still the same stereotypical liminal place, but as if it were filmed in Twilight or whatever) and under the bed there too(?).

Something was happening with one of the roommates. Beforehand, I had the background information that he looked like a person; now, he was just some foggy outline. (This is not unusual in my dreams however, people typically end up or already are just vague concepts instead of full-fledged features.) I engaged with him, and he wasn’t.. really mad? Or surprised? And the person allegedly might’ve been “annoying” or a bother somehow that would, in their minds, justify killing them. I felt relieved but also not. The murder bothered me, and I did feel more worried about being caught (not even going to jail, prison, any of that, just found out) but the nonchalance held by him(?) did not do much to comfort me. 

This didn’t turn any major points; it seemed to be right where that segment ended, with the knocked-out people left under the bed, myself being acknowledged by the dude, and then. It all just stopped.

Cue the next part, which is more what I’m worried about and still feeling paranoia from.  


For clarity (if anyone is still here, you’ll know what I’m talking about if you continue and remember this) I have no idea if the coffee ants part came before or after, I’m going under the assumption it came after.  


I had an entire life suddenly. I existed in this space, and there were so many people living with me, at least 20? There was an upstairs and a downstairs with two large staircases on each side, and a main area, rooms everywhere (mostly bedrooms on one side in the bottom and top floor), it looked slightly older, with that nice darker wood you see in certain homes. Think the floor was a darker carpet, too, at least on the first floor. The walls were too vague but might’ve been stone or some darker color as well.

People just milling about, all shapes, sizes, and races. We just existed peacefully and nothing was wrong. There was banter and potential pettiness, but nothing that ever seemed to devolve into long-lasting drama or worse. It was nice, almost like what I had wanted. A community place, a large house with people I think(?) I cared about. There wasn’t any worry of hunger, thirst, and we weren’t at odds with each other for any real reason. People shared relationships casually and fully and enjoyed each other to every extent, and it was sweet to see all the couples there. Even then, single people/non-romantic people seemed to be present as well.   
  
I had a partner, and for a brief moment, I loved him a lot. It felt like I was with someone who truly cared about me. He was nice, and I sort of recall his appearance, and what’s even weirder is that he wouldn’t be someone I would typically go for. I don’t mention that out of weirdness/rudeness, but I feel it may be relevant to the later parts. We cuddled in bed once, the majority of the rooms were small but crammed with the details that gave them their own charm and characteristics. His/Ours had a comfortable bed with that sort of old quilt blanket with the squares on it, the room had a blue filter, too. You could not see outside of any of the windows here, either. His had 1-2, also had a bookshelf, possibly a desk and/or chest-thing in front of the bed to store things in. There may have been decorations, but my mind filtered the details out. I remember sometimes going outside of the room and interacting with the others, and I progressively got this feeling of longing and loneliness, like I was missing out on all the people this place had to offer. I’ve never cheated on anyone (and I never plan to), though I have been polyamorous, so that could influence this, as well. I remember going to sleep at night at least once with him holding me in his arms, talking to him, talking to others, hearing others at night, so on.   
  
I don’t know when it happened, I was just one day aware that I was not meant to be here, and he went from feeling like a life partner to someone who was.. assigned to me, almost. Not the man I loved, just a positive facade. And the weird thing is, I don’t think I was lucid. The terror I felt was something I think that stayed contained inside my dream. It wasn’t exactly not belonging, it started off as isolation and then snowballed into pure uncanny territory. I had the things I had wanted to see, yet it wasn’t for me in some capacity. No one recognized or even seemed to know my terror, and for all my information my guy/person acted entirely normal, it was me, whatever spectator I was in, that went both in and out of this guy’s body (perspectives shifting) feeling the fear. But I felt isolated, like no matter how much I interacted, I was alone. I saw people work together and I had this feeling that I would never truly belong with them / would never fully be let in. And no one was mean to me, either. This was purely a me thing.

I was in one of the upstairs bedrooms by myself (he faded away at some point, too) with another person (not a relationship, just existing), and I felt bad. I half-expressed my loneliness. And all of a sudden, these other people came into the room and chattered around me like old friends. Maybe they were, but I wouldn’t recognize that. They spoke to me, and amongst themselves after I just remained silent. It was like I wasn’t fully there. Again, not in the sense of being isolated or left alone by a group of people, but this creeping feeling that I just was not real and this place was wrong, somehow.   
  
The last thing I recall is it being more night hours, and I think we were having a movie night. Nothing was on at that moment, and everyone was lying down on this really weird couch arrangement (multiple couches strung together like a maze/bendy snake). There may have been a few cuddling, but it seemed more just single file soldier position/on their backs. I was with a different man (context: had a full beard and stereotypical masculine face), who expressed some feeling towards me, but it made me feel more worried than it did interested. He was nice at first, and I almost felt attracted to him, he was laying on my lower body, and I was petting his hair for a bit. Then he looked at me, and I only saw one side of his face for a second, which looked normal, until something about it changed, one side not having a beard, instead a half of a mustache, an eye slightly being longer, and his hair being a different texture. He was smiling at me (almost unhinged-looking), and I didn’t like it. Granted, this wasn’t like an alternate level of weirdness, yet it gave me a large spike of uncomfortability, and I think that’s just where that dream ended.

  
The next portions/final portions of the dream started with a similar make of the previous house, but not as correct? Hard to describe, just lost charm. I was with some people, but they were less defined than before, and back to vagueness. We weren’t doing much until there was some sort of issue outside? I recall it was the first time I had gotten a glimpse at the outside world, and the brief parts I did see was a parking lot / concrete thing directly in front of the house/the immediate ground and then a very large, lush beautiful forest/set of trees surrounding it. I couldn’t see anything past this. There were some cars, most notably what was a mish-mash of a police car and firetruck. 

There were two men in uniform talking near the vehicle, and I don’t remember ever walking to them, just suddenly jumping to talking / being acknowledged by them. I offered (or they requested?) some coffee, and I obliged. That also seemed to set in stone that we, the home/people would be making coffee, I guess. I’m not quite sure what it was but one of the actions taken here had a bad effect and let this creature- a “false person” in. I will say right now, if you have entomophobia, you probably want to stop. It ping-ponged back and forth from being obvious to not. My person/guy seemed to not initially notice, and the “person” was working in one of the upstairs rooms that was spontaneously the de-facto kitchen. I made a very smooth and nice coffee, and when they were present in the room, they added (or were allowed to?) do their own thing to it, which was just. A bunch of ants. Inside/on the cup. For some reason, my guy was not at all aware of this despite there being multiple black dots and viewed it as a part of the coffee. It was strange because they were more on the cup than it, yet his hand made them fade inside it / become more dot-like, so it was less noticeable that they were. Well. Bugs!

He brought the cups out to the cops, and they left, and I got this terrible sense that I had infected them with some disease, that I had let something fall onto them and there was going to be bad things just because of that coffee. I went back, and I believe I was more me than my guy this time, because I immediately called out the ant person. The other “workers” were acting like I was crazy, or as if it was normal, not really disturbed by my aggressiveness, but I kept pointing out or trying to get them to see that this was wrong. Some orders still went out, I think, but the person/skin suit thing eventually disappeared (I do not remember it having proper eyes or teeth, either; it never seemed to open its mouth).

Of course, nonsensically, it was like we went backwards, and the ant person was at the door. When I opened the door, I could see the ants crawling around the face, into and around the eyes and mouth, and likely in other places, and I could tell the flesh was looser than what a person's should be like. It started off as a thin man smiling with no teeth, and then just jump-cut to a large. Bug-person. I know this sounds so silly, however the closest I can describe it is a more blurry, nightmarish version of the supreme ant from the Roblox game Blocktales. It was very much going to harm me in some manner, yet funnily it acted like a vampire. It could not be let in unless I gave it explicit permission. My coworkers semi-ceased to exist, but I still recall arguing with them to not let it in, even though I was the only one in front of the door, and probably alone, at some point.

Something something vague ending with my sibling, K, at a large Walmart at sunset, and this unnerving fear because people were not right and they didn’t have identities, and I felt like I was being watched by an outside party or similar. And then, strangely, my mother came to pick us up as if we were both kids on the way to have a sleepover. The car made me feel safer, though I still didn’t feel like the nightmare ended. And then I woke up, feeling intense paranoia and dread, like something was wrong or had been taken from me, somehow. If it’s relevant/anyone spiritual wants to chime in, I lit a candle for protection first and then a return-to-sender. Earlier, immediately after I bought them, I felt a wave of nervousness/extreme dread.",1,1737292403.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------

Are you tired of throwing away kitchen scraps and feeling guilty about the waste you're creating? A home composter for your kitchen is a fantastic solution! Not only does it help reduce landfill waste, but it also offers numerous benefits that you can take advantage of right in your own home.

### Reduce Waste

One of the main reasons to invest in a home composter for your kitchen waste is to significantly reduce the amount of garbage you produce. In the average household, almost 30% of waste is organic. By composting, you can minimize your trash output and play a vital role in environmental conservation.

### Create Nutrient-Rich Soil

Kitchen scraps, such as vegetable peels, fruit cores, and coffee grounds, can transform into dark, rich compost that is a fantastic fertilizer for your garden. This nutrient-rich soil improves plant growth, enhances soil structure, and boosts microbial activity in your garden.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
### Save Money

Using compost in your garden can reduce or eliminate the need to buy commercial fertilizers. This simple switch not only saves you money but also results in healthier plants that don't rely on synthetic substances. Think about the cost savings from using homemade compost instead of store-bought alternatives!

### Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions

When organic waste decomposes in landfills, it produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. By composting at home, you can keep this waste out of landfills and help lower your carbon footprint.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
### Encourage Eco-Friendly Practices

Composting into your daily routine promotes eco-friendly habits. It's a great way to teach children and family members about sustainability and caring for the environment. Watching food scraps turn into compost can ignite a love for nature and a better understanding of waste management.

### Enhance Kitchen Cleanliness

It might be counterintuitive, but using a home composter can keep your kitchen cleaner! Rather than letting food scraps sit in a trash can, where they can smell bad and attract pests, a compost container allows you to manage waste more effectively. Many modern composters come with odor-control features, making it easier to keep your kitchen smelling fresh.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
### Convenience of Home Composting

Home composters are designed to fit your kitchen's space and lifestyle. Many compact models can be used right on your countertop or under the sink. Here are some convenient options:

- **Countertop Composters:** Compact and stylish, perfect for small kitchens.
- **Bokashi Bins:** Great for fermenting food scraps with minimal odor.
- **Compost Tumbler:** Easy to turn and aerate your compost, speeding up the process.

### Attract Beneficial Insects

When you compost, you enhance biodiversity in your garden. Compost not only nourishes the soil but also helps attract beneficial insects like earthworms and pollinators. These helpers are crucial for healthy plant life, resulting in more vibrant and productive gardens.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
### Easy to Start

Starting a kitchen composter is much easier than you might think. Here is a simple process to get you going:

1. Choose the right home composter for your needs.
2. Gather your kitchen scraps such as vegetable peels, fruit skins, and eggshells.
3. Add a mix of browns (like dried leaves or paper) with greens (like food scraps) for a balanced compost pile.
4. Turn or mix regularly to aerate and speed up the composting process.

A home composter for your kitchen waste is a powerful step towards sustainability. By reducing waste, saving money, and creating nutrient-rich compost, you are contributing positively to the environment and fostering healthy habits for yourself and your family. So why wait? Start your composting adventure today!

Choosing the Right Home Composter: A Guide for Beginners
--------------------------------------------------------

Are you looking to start composting but don't know where to begin? A home composter for your kitchen can be a game changer for both your waste management and your garden. Choosing the right one, however, can be overwhelming with so many options available. Here’s a guide to help you find the perfect home composter that suits your needs.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
### Understanding Composting Basics

Composting is a natural way to recycle organic material, like food scraps and yard waste, into a rich soil amendment. This process helps reduce waste in landfills and nourishes your plants. A kitchen composter makes it easy to gather your organic waste and get started right at home.

### Types of Home Composters

When choosing a home composter for your kitchen, it’s essential to understand the different types available:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
- **Countertop Composters:** These small units sit on your kitchen counter, making it easy to toss in scraps as you prepare meals. They often come with a carbon filter to reduce odors.
- **Worm Bins:** Also known as vermicomposting, these composters use worms to break down food waste. They are compact and can be a fun project for families.
- **Bokashi Bins:** This method ferments food waste using beneficial microbes. Bokashi bins can handle a wider range of food, including dairy and meat.
- **Outdoor Compost Bins:** If you have the space, an outdoor bin can handle larger amounts of waste, allowing for a more extensive composting system.

### Assessing Your Needs

Before you choose a composter, consider your kitchen space, the volume of waste you produce, and your lifestyle. Ask yourself these questions:

- How much food waste do you generate weekly?
- Do you have a yard or outdoor space?
- Do you have kids or pets that might affect your composting?

Your answers will guide you to the right type of composter that meets your needs without taking up unnecessary space.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
### Size Matters

Size is a crucial factor to consider when selecting a home composter for your kitchen. A small apartment might benefit more from a compact countertop model, while a larger household producing more waste might require a bigger bin. Remember, an overloaded composter can lead to odor issues and slow down the decomposition process.

### Material and Construction

Home composters come in various materials, including plastic, metal, and wood. Here’s how to evaluate the options:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
- **Plastic:** Lightweight and easy to clean, plastic composters are affordable and effective for beginners.
- **Metal:** These composters are sturdy and can look great in your kitchen, although they may be more expensive.
- **Wood:** A wooden composter often blends well with outdoor environments but requires more maintenance.

### Price Range

The price of a home composter can vary widely. While you can find basic countertop models for around $30, more advanced outdoor systems could cost over $100. Set a budget that fits your lifestyle, and don’t forget to factor in any additional tools or supplies you might need, such as compost activators or worms for vermicomposting.

### Ease of Use

Look for features that make the composter user-friendly. Here are some aspects to consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
- **Ease of access:** Make sure you can easily add scraps and turn the compost when necessary.
- **Odor control:** Check if the composter has filters or contains mechanisms to reduce smell.
- **Durability:** Inspect the quality to ensure your composter lasts for years to come.

### Starting Your Composting Journey

Once you have chosen the right home composter for your kitchen, it's time to start composting! Begin by gathering your organic waste like vegetable peels, coffee grounds, and eggshells. Remember, it's essential to maintain a balance of green (nitrogen-rich) and brown (carbon-rich) materials for successful composting. You'll soon be transforming kitchen scraps into nutrient-rich compost for your garden!

By considering the type, size, material, price, and ease of use, you're now equipped to choose the perfect home composter for your kitchen. Enjoy the process of composting, and watch your kitchen waste turn into valuable soil for your plants!

### Conclusion

Using a home composter for your kitchen waste is a practical and impactful choice for both your household and the environment. Not only does it help reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, but it also transforms your food scraps into nutrient-rich compost. This compost can then enrich your garden or potted plants, helping them thrive. As you embark on this journey, remember that the benefits extend far beyond waste reduction; you’re actively participating in a sustainable lifestyle that promotes ecological balance and contributes to healthier soil.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-composter-for-kitchen  
  
When selecting the right home composter, consider factors like available space, your composting goals, and the type of materials you will compost. For beginners, starting with a basic indoor composter can make the process manageable and less overwhelming. Options like countertop compost bins or even compact electric composters are great choices if you have limited space. As you gain confidence, you may explore larger outdoor composting systems that cater to your needs.

Adopting a home composter in your kitchen is not just about managing waste; it's about creating a cleaner, greener future for you and generations to come. Every small step you take contributes to a larger movement towards sustainability. By choosing to compost, you are making an active decision to reduce your environmental footprint, increase your gardening efforts, and teach the importance of recycling organic waste. Start today; your kitchen—and the planet—will thank you!

Greetings!

I've been building a healthy eating app for 9 months, and I'm happy to share it with you.

Healthy eating is a crucial part of our lives, but we tend to ignore it, especially when we're already feeling healthy. What we eat impacts our moods, thoughts, discipline—overall, it affects our life experience. If you're nutrition-conscious enough, you can eliminate risks of chronic diseases by simply avoiding or limiting certain compounds in your diet and including what’s necessary.

This app is here to help with that.

Feel free to check out my work. Your support would mean a lot to me! Return with your username via DM, and I’d love to thank you with an in-app gift for your early support :)

If you have any thoughts, suggestions, or questions about the app, feel free to reach out, and I'll respond as soon as I'm online!

I just went to visit an old friend. He slept all day and it was all about his boyfriend (who didn’t even care to get to know me). I caught an early flight “due to weather” but in reality if I wanted to bedrot, I could do that on my own.

Then one moment changed everything, and now he’s gone. Was I wrong?","This story has been weighing on my mind for a long time. It’s about a friendship that meant everything to me, the painful moment I risked it all for honesty and the struggles with the consequences that followed.

MAK (bff, cover name) and I first met in college, sharing a few classes. We didn’t connect deeply at first, but over time, our paths crossed more often. Conversations started casually—complaining about the stress of college or our shared frustration with the overwhelming expectations placed on us. What started as small talk turned into deeper discussions about life, family, and dreams for the future. MAK wasn’t the loud, boisterous type. He was calm, and grounded, and had a way of making everything feel less chaotic, even when the world often felt like too much.

MAK had this quiet confidence that I deeply admired. Where I wrestled with my own storm of emotions and overthinking, he carried himself with a steadiness that felt like an anchor, and the best thing about him was that he was unapologetically himself. He wasn’t one to force his presence or opinions but had this ability to simply *be there* in a way that made you feel seen. His calm nature was reassuring, and it contrasted so strongly with the noise in my own mind that I found myself gravitating toward him. He had a closeness to his family that I envied—a warmth and stability that I lacked in my own life. There were moments, small but significant, where he’d hold a hug just a little longer or look at me with a depth that made me wonder if he understood me better than anyone else. MAK wasn’t just a friend; he was the balance to my chaos, someone who brought clarity to my most overwhelming thoughts.

I didn’t notice it immediately, but he slowly became the person I trusted most. We started spending time together outside of school, grabbing coffee or sitting for hours talking about everything. He had a way of listening that made me feel heard that I hadn’t experienced before.

I remember one day vividly, venting to him about some serious family issues I had, and the fact that I was not only into women and still adjusting to that. He didn’t try to fix it or offer advice; he just said, “I get it. It sucks, but you’ll get through it. You’re stronger than you think.” It was the way he said it, with such quiet conviction, that stuck with me. For someone like me, always overthinking and doubting myself, that kind of reassurance meant everything.

I fell in love with MAK because he made me feel seen in a way no one else had. He had this rare ability to sit with my chaos without trying to fix it, to listen without judgment, and to let me be vulnerable without making me feel weak. It wasn’t just his words but his presence—the way he could calm me just by being there. I admired his steadiness, his ability to handle life without overthinking, and the quiet strength he exuded. MAK represented everything I wanted more of in my life: clarity, calm, and confidence.

What really deepened my feelings, though, was how he accepted me fully. When I came out to him, he didn’t flinch or act uncomfortable. He simply said he was proud of me for sharing. That moment meant the world to me because it showed me that MAK wasn’t just a friend—he was someone who genuinely cared. The way he treated me, the way he listened and supported me, made me feel like maybe, just maybe, there was a chance he saw me as more than a friend too.

As we grew closer, I started noticing little things—things that made me wonder if maybe he felt something more too. He didn’t talk about girls the way most guys in college did. In fact, he avoided the topic entirely. And when I came out to him as gay, he didn’t even flinch. He just listened and said he was glad I trusted him. He’d also do things that felt different—like holding hugs a little longer than necessary or texting me out of the blue to say he misses hanging out. Sometimes I’d catch him looking at me in a way that felt more intimate than just friendship. Those moments, however small, gave me hope.

But hope is a fragile thing, and I knew I might be projecting my own feelings onto him. As much as I wanted to believe there could be something more, the fear of being wrong kept me silent for a long time. By the time my feelings were undeniable, keeping them hidden started to feel unbearable. Every time I saw him, I felt this ache—a mix of joy and pain because I couldn’t tell him the truth.

I debated walking away, trying to create distance so I could sort out my emotions. But the idea of losing him, even as a friend, was unthinkable. I convinced myself that being honest was the only way forward, even if it came with risks. It wasn’t about expecting him to feel the same; it was about the weight of carrying something so big, so personal, and so painful.

One evening, we were at my house, sitting in my room. We were talking about our plans after college, tossing around ideas about where we’d go and what we’d do. The conversation felt light and easy, but I could feel my heart pounding. I was terrified, but I knew it was time. “MAK,” I said, my voice trembling, “there’s something I need to tell you.”

He looked at me, calm as always, and nodded for me to continue. I took a deep breath and said: “I think I’m in love with you.”

There was silence, and for a moment, I thought maybe I’d made the biggest mistake of my life. Then he sighed, and his expression softened. “I care about you so much,” he said. “But I don’t think I can be what you want me to be. There’s no need to cry, it’s just a rejection”

Those words hit me harder than I expected. I tried to hold myself together, nodding as he explained that he’d never seen me that way. He said he valued our friendship and didn’t want to lose it, but he couldn’t lie to me or himself. I understood, but it didn’t make the rejection any easier. It wasn’t just the loss of hope that hurt—it was the fear that I’d ruined everything between us.

After my confession, it all ended abruptly. MAK made it clear that we couldn’t continue as friends. He told me that I wouldn’t be able to move on or get over him if we stayed in each other’s lives. His words were final, and there wasn’t room for negotiation. Losing him at that moment felt like losing a part of myself. He wasn’t just my best friend—he was my anchor, the person who made me feel safe in a world that often felt overwhelming. And now, that sense of safety was gone.

It wasn’t just the heartbreak of rejection—it was the suddenness of it all. One moment, he was someone I trusted with everything and the next, he was out of my life completely. The emptiness he left behind was suffocating. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d ruined everything by being honest, but at the same time, I couldn’t ignore how much his response hurt me.

In the months that followed, I wrestled with guilt and regret. Should I have kept my feelings to myself? Was I selfish for confessing? Had I misread everything? The doubt was suffocating…

During this time, I found solace in an online community on skool for gay men where people shared their struggles, heartbreaks, and triumphs. The community was called Gay Unmasked, Reading their stories helped me realize I wasn’t alone. One post, in particular, stood out to me. Someone wrote, “Honesty might cost you, but it sets you free.” That hit me hard because it was true. Telling MAK how I felt wasn’t just about him—it was about being true to myself, even if it meant risking rejection.

But even now, I can’t shake the ache of losing him. It’s a dull, constant pain that resurfaces in quiet moments—when I hear a song we used to love, or when I pass the places we used to go. The silence between us feels deafening, and I wonder if I’ll ever truly get over him.

Some nights, the weight of it all becomes too much. I lie awake, replaying every moment, every word, asking myself the same unanswerable question: *Should I have done something differently?* The thought claws at me, leaving me gasping for air, desperate for a way to undo what’s already been done. We go to the college together too so I have to see him every single day, and he doesn't even look at me or say hi even if I do.

The community has been my saving grace, but the truth is, there are moments when even that isn’t enough. Moments when the darkness creeps in, whispering that I’m unlovable, that my feelings will always push people away. Moments when I wonder if life would feel easier without the constant ache.

And now I’m left asking you, Reddit: *What would you have done in my shoes? Should I have kept my feelings to myself? Was I selfish for confessing, or was it better to be honest, no matter the cost?*

I was nervous, im sorry. 

There's a guy I used to like in high school 7ish years ago, I never spoke to him as I pretty much kept to myself. I moved schools a lot and by the time I settled into my final high school I transfered in the middle of the 11th grade, everyone had their friend groups by then and I was incredibly shy as a kid with undiagnosed anxiety so I kept to myself as much as I could. He was well known and pretty kind but we never crossed paths and I never had the guts to make a move.

After all these years I didn't think much of anyone after graduating and went through my own fair share of traumatic experiences in my early 20s so I was pretty occupied in a state of depression for a few years. I've been getting a lot better after seeing a therapist for almost a year now and have worked out a lot of my issues. I grew up in a narcissistic family, thus, a lot of experiences were taken away from me growing up, including my love life. Which is why I was kind of crashing out in my last post, seems immature but I haven't had the greatest experience in that part of my life so my post seemed frantic and all. 

Its been a few days since I requested him on Instagram but I didn't get any response, then again, we weren't friends so maybe he just doesn't know who I am, or he's just not as active on his socials. I'm not really taking it to heart.

I spoke to a friend and a cousin, my cousin (20m) said to just text him hey and keep it casual and my friend (23f) said not to text him at all until he responds to the request as that itself was me shooting my shot. Both advices seem like the opposite of something I would do, maybe it's just cus I have different values or the fact that I have no experience in this aspect of my life, but I'm not looking for anything casual at this age (I'm 24) and I don't like the idea of waiting on him to take action when he doesn't even know whats going on, on my end.

I was wondering if it would be weird or odd to just shoot him a text saying: ""Hey, this is super random, but would you be interested in grabbing a coffee or something sometime? No worries if not, just thought I'd ask:)""

Idk if being that straight to the point is off putting but I'd rather just save myself the time of this whole talking stage via text and get to the point. If he says yes and seems like I decent person there would be a chance there I guess and if not it'll give me the opportunity to move on. 

Any advice?

Most common is listening to music or a podcast while doing something.

Another I do a lot is: To motivate me to take a walk outside I need to do something there. Even if it’s just drinking my coffee outside. Or read a few pages in a book. Or do a little run (more like a sprint).

Something that also helps me so much to call my relatives regularly: Call them while I’m on the way to a place or while I’m doing chores. Otherwise just the thought of calling them makes me die of boredom!

Same with answering email or filling out simple unimportant forms. I can do them best when it’s done by the side of a main project. Like let me just answer this email real quick and then we can go grocery shopping. That creates urgency.

The Empty Chair

The house felt hollow, even though its walls stood firm. It wasn’t the kind of emptiness that could be fixed by turning on the TV or letting the kettle hum—it was deeper, something that settled in the chest and refused to move.

Shayne stared at the chair in the corner of the kitchen, the one no one dared to move since she’d left. It wasn’t because he expected her to come back and sit in it—he knew better than that. But that chair was hers, and somehow, it still held a piece of her.

He ran his hand through his graying beard and whistled softly. Like clockwork, two pairs of paws padded across the wooden floor. Sol and Bridgy, his loyal companions, were the only witnesses to his grief, the only souls who didn’t flinch when the weight of it all spilled out. Bridgy, ever the gentle one, rested her head on his knee, her eyes brimming with the kind of empathy only a dog could give. Sol sat beside him, stiff and watchful, as if standing guard over the pieces of Shayne that still remained intact.

“It’s just us, huh?” Shayne muttered, scratching Bridgy’s ears. “Just us against the world.”

He couldn’t remember the last time he’d spoken those words without choking on them. Four and a half years. Four and a half years since the bedroom room where he’d held her hand for the last time. Four and a half years of waking up to an empty bed, of cooking dinner for one and watching it go cold because he’d lost his appetite. Four and a half years of people saying, “She wouldn’t want you to be sad,” as if grief could be turned off like a tap.

It wasn’t that he didn’t try. He went to work, made small talk with strangers, and even smiled when he had to. But inside, he carried the weight of her absence everywhere. It showed up in the mundane moments—the way her laugh no longer echoed through the house, the scent of her perfume that had long since faded from the bedroom, the way he instinctively reached for her hand in the middle of the night only to find nothing but air.

But it wasn’t enough, not always. He still felt like a man walking through the world in black and white, chasing the memory of color. He missed her in ways he couldn’t articulate, in ways that didn’t make sense. He missed the way she wrinkled her nose at bad jokes, the way she scolded him for leaving the milk out, the way her voice softened when she said his name.

He missed the sound of her humming in the kitchen, that little tune she never seemed to finish. He missed the way she’d sit cross-legged on the couch, wrapped in that old, fraying blanket she refused to replace. He missed the quiet moments most of all, the spaces where no words were needed—just the brush of her hand on his arm, or the way she’d tilt her head to lean on his shoulder during a movie. Those were the moments that made life feel full, and without them, he felt like a hollowed-out version of himself.

Sometimes, he caught glimpses of her in the smallest things. The sunlight streaming through the window in the late afternoon reminded him of the way it used to catch in her hair, turning it golden. The smell of freshly brewed coffee could almost convince him she was in the next room, scrolling her phone like she always did in the mornings. And sometimes, when he closed his eyes, he could almost hear her laugh—not the polite kind she reserved for strangers, but the real one, the laugh that started in her chest and spilled out in waves, the one that made him feel like he’d won something just by being the reason for it.

It was cruel, the way the world kept spinning when his had come to a halt. The way the trees still bloomed in the spring, the way the rain still fell, the way strangers still laughed and held hands in the street, all while his hands felt empty. The unfairness of it sat like a stone in his chest. She was gone, and yet the stars still hung in the sky, indifferent to his grief.

He used to talk to her—out loud, at first. In the early days, when the pain was raw and unfiltered, he’d sit by her favorite chair and tell her everything: how the days had been, how much he missed her, how lost he felt without her. But over time, the words grew harder to say, like they were getting caught somewhere between his throat and his heart. Now, the conversations were silent, spoken only in the quiet corners of his mind.

“I don’t know who I am without you,” he once whispered into the empty room. And that was the crux of it. She wasn’t just a part of his life—she was the anchor that kept him steady, the compass that gave him direction. Without her, he felt adrift, like a ship lost at sea, searching for a lighthouse that no longer existed.

Most nights, he lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering if he’d ever feel whole again. He hated that word—whole. It implied he’d been broken, and maybe he had. Maybe he was shattered in ways that couldn’t be fixed, pieces of him scattered across the past. And yet, in the quiet, he sometimes heard her voice whispering in the back of his mind. “Keep going, Shayne. Just keep going.”

But going where? To what? He didn’t have an answer. He only had the ache in his chest, the echo of her laughter, and the company of two dogs who didn’t understand his words but somehow seemed to feel the heaviness of his heart.

And maybe that was all he had left: the memories, the weight, and the hope—faint, fragile—that one day he’d learn to carry it all without crumbling.

From South Africa and the doctors here are not very knowledgeable on EOE, or well, the do's and don'ts. I've been diagnosed and then tested allergic to wholegrain.

I've been put on Pulmicort Budesonide Nebulising Suspension which seems to work for me. Just a couple of questions and I'm asking it because the specialist just gave me the suspension and said I must do an elimination diet. He hasn't answered any of these questions:

**- I've eaten gluten free oats, but I would still feel bad. Is it possible that all wholegrain could affect my symptoms?**

**- How long does it take for my system to react to whatever is causing my allergies in general? It feels like this is the most important question as it would be easy to know what affects me if it happened straigt afterwards which doesn't seem to happen.**

**- There are some stuff that cause immediate triggers and that is coffee and chocolate - instant. How does this figure into EOE as i'm not allergic to any of the two?** 

**- How big of an issue is alcohol usage? I would feel bad and drink 2 glasses of whiskey in the evening and my pain in the esophagus goes away, but 3 days after a big night of alcohol I would feel bad for days.**

**- Lastly, the Pulmicort Budesonide Nebulising Suspension seems to work. Is it safe to use long term? Again, my doctor doesn't seem to know.**

Sorry for all the questions, but I have nowhere else to go to find answers.

  
Thanks!

Chris

Your outfit is like the movie trailer of your personality: does it hype you up or flop at the box office?

And You don’t need to spend like a celebrity on the red. A few good, versatile pieces that can be combined in a different ways. 
Don't fall into the trap of buying trendy, low-quality clothes because  trends come and go, a well-curated, timeless wardrobe will always work in your favor.





Let’s break it down:
(I have used some fashion & style terms like straight-fit, baggy jeans etc and if you feel; what the heck, they are? Just Search the web if you want to buy the specifics.)


1. Building a Versatile Wardrobe Around Basics 🔄

Imagine your wardrobe is like a video game skill tree. Start with the essential upgrades before branching out. Basics are those upgrades—they’re timeless, versatile, and can adapt to almost any situation and you can mix match basics to create different looks.

The Must-Have Basics

White Shirt: The MVP of your wardrobe. Works for formal meetings, casual hangouts, or dates.

Basic Tees (Black & White): These are like the foundation of a house—get them right, and you can build anything on top.

Dark Jeans: The classic that never fails. Just say no to bedazzled, ripped jeans from 2010.

Chinos: Think of these as jeans’ sophisticated cousin. They’re comfortable, classy, and can go formal or casual.

Blazer: A navy or grey blazer is your cheat code for instant sophistication.

Polo Shirt: Halfway between a tee and a shirt, perfect for looking sharp while staying comfy.

Casual Jacket: A denim or bomber jacket is your go-to for layering and cooler weather.

Well-Fitted Trousers: For when jeans won’t cut it, these are essential for formal or business settings.


Think of these as your Avengers. Alone, they’re strong. Together, they’re unstoppable.



2. Fit is King: Dress Your Type 🕶️

You wouldn’t play a game on a laggy PC, right? Same with your clothes—they need to fit perfectly to function. Fit is what separates “put together” from “fell out of bed.”

Dress for Your Body Type 📏

Shorter Men:

Slim-fit is your friend; baggy clothes will make you look shorter.

Vertical patterns (think pinstripes) add the illusion of height.

Monochrome(same color upper and lower wear) outfits streamline your look and make you appear taller.


Tall Men:

Avoid clothes that are too tight or too baggy—balance is key.
Layering (like a jacket over a tee) breaks up your height nicely.
Medium-fits keep your proportions in check.


Slim Build:

Choose clothes that add visual weight, like checks or textured fabrics.
Henley shirts add volume without looking bulky.
Avoid overly skinny fits—they’ll make you look smaller.



Muscular/Stocky Build:

Straight-cut trousers and relaxed fits for your frame.
Stick to neutral tones and avoid busy patterns.
Subtle checks and herringbone patterns can help balance your look.
.


3. Understanding Color Theory for Indian Skin Tones 🎨

Let’s talk colors. Imagine your outfit is a painting. Pick the wrong colors, and the painting looks off. Choose the right ones, and it’s a masterpiece.


Undertones: A Crash Course

Undertones are the natural colors underneath your skin that affect how different clothes look on you. Knowing your undertone helps you pick clothes that suit your skin and make you look great.
If you can't get it, just search for these actors or actresses below and look at their skin tone and then undertone:

Cool Undertones:

1. Chris Hemsworth (Fair Skin)
2. Emma Stone (Fair Skin)
3. Lupita Nyong'o (Dark Skin)
4. Zayn Malik (Medium Skin)
5. Henry Cavill (Fair Skin)
6. Idris Elba (Dark Skin)
7. Tessa Thompson (Dark Skin)
8. Kerry Washington (Medium Skin)


Warm Undertones:
1. Will Smith (Medium Skin)
2. Beyoncé (Medium Skin)
3. Salma Hayek (Medium Skin)
4. Jessica Alba (Medium Skin)
5. Megan Fox (Fair Skin)
6. Chris Pratt (Fair Skin)
7. Ryan Gosling (Fair Skin)
8. Kim Kardashian (Medium Skin)


Cool Undertones: Think pink, blue, or purplish skin hues(hues are colors underneath skin). 
Best colors that'll suit you? Blues, navy, grey, and black.

Warm Undertones: Yellow or peachy hues mean earthy tones like olive, brown, beige, and khaki will look great.

Neutral Undertones: Almost anything works! Just avoid extremes.

Best Colors for Indian Skin Tones 👕

Fair Skin: Soft blues, cool greys, black, white, burgundy, and emerald green. Avoid very pale pastels.

Medium Skin: Olive green, navy blue, charcoal, beige, white, and mustard yellow. Earthy tones work well here.

Dark Skin: Bold colors like royal blue, burgundy, purple, deep green, and rust look amazing. Steer clear of pale colors or anything too close to your skin tone, which can wash you out.

Some Practical Tips for Buying Clothes Smartly 🛍️

Building a wardrobe doesn’t mean you need to rush into a mall and spend all your money on the first thing you see. Take your time, be strategic, and focus on the value of what you’re purchasing.



While, offline purchase can be done easily, Here are a few online buying tips that will make the process easier:

1st Find your Size: 
Buy few clothes to find your size and make sure they fit well. Bring a measuring tape with you and measure key areas like chest, waist, and inseam to help when shopping online later.


2nd Wishlist Clothes Online & Buy When Prices Drop: 
Once you’ve figured out what fits you well, wishlist your favorite items online. Wait for sales or price drops before buying. Most brands and stores will offer seasonal discounts, so patience is your best tool and slowly, build your personal wardrobe over time.




3rd Understand That Not Everything Will Work: 
Sometimes, you might think a piece looks amazing on the rack or online, but once you try it on, it might not feel right. ""Eat food as per your taste, but clothing as per the taste of others."" You might love that bright, branded logo shirt, but others might feel it’s too flashy or not suitable for your body type. The key is to focus on what works for you(comfort wise) and what others will find attractive.


4th Avoid Flashy Designs and Excessive Patterns: 
Flashy logos or clothes with too many symbols can come off as immature. These items may look trendy now, but they’ll quickly feel outdated. Instead, go for solid, simple pieces. Classic designs never go out of style, and even as you grow older, they will continue to serve you well.


5th Buy Quality, Not Branding:
Social status is often judged by whether or not someone is wearing a recognizable brand. If you don’t wear a brand (like me), it doesn’t matter. Focus on quality. Look for clothes that don’t have logos or brand names on the outside. When you buy pieces with no visible logos, people won’t be distracted by the brand—they’ll focus on the fit, quality, and style of the clothing itself.



For example, a denim jacket without a brand logo will make people notice your unique sense of style, rather than what’s printed on the jacket. You want to be recognized for your taste, not the logo on your chest.


Final Thought:

Dressing well isn’t about following trends or buying everything with a brand logo. It's about strategically building your wardrobe around quality basics, focusing on fit, and choosing timeless pieces that can be mixed and matched for any occasion.

Remember, your clothing isn’t just about you—it’s about the message it sends to others. Start building your wardrobe with these tips, and level up your style. Share this guide with others who need help dressing smartly.

We had a few days of no contact but we started texting again in a friendly manner and agreed to stay friends.

She came to pick up her stuff yesterday, a week after we broke up. 30 seconds into her visit we were flirting. She packed a lot of her stuff and then came to the kitchen drawer where I usually kept some his/her engraved coffee spoons. She asked what happened to them and I said I threw them. She went off to the bedroom, sat on the bed and cried. I followed her in and sat next to her and hugged her and we held hands for a bit. We then headed out to the living room to pack more stuff. As she was done she stood close to me and we ended up hugging which turned into a kiss. She said “I knew it was a bad idea coming here”. I say “why” and she says “because we just kissed”. As she leant over to pick up her stuff she jokingly called me a pervert for looking at her bum. We head downstairs and as she leaves through the door I say don’t be a stranger. She goes to kiss me on the cheek but I turn my head into her lips, she thought it was an accident that I did that but I saw her go for my cheek in the corner of my eye. The point is there is still a lot of chemistry and flirting despite how many times we have broken up and this seemingly being the last time we will be together. 

She texted me later and we talk most of the night, and there is still a lot of flirting, us talking positively about what happened earlier and her saying she wishes she got to spend longer with me. I said I like spending time with her and she says she does too, I then say some things just needed work (because there was a lot of arguments in our relationship) and she says she just needs to work on herself and heal from everything that happened from high school and beyond. Now this doesn’t sound like her door is explicitly open but sounds like a sign. I still love her and want her back but I’m just wondering what the best approach is.

","Hey friends!

I’ve always been pretty organized, but I decided to test AI: Could it plan my week better than I can? Here’s how it went.

# Step 1: Feeding the details

I started by asking ChatGPT to plan my week. I gave it all the details:

* Work tasks (deadlines, meetings, etc.)
* Personal goals (gym, meal prep, downtime)
* Recurring chores (laundry, groceries)
* Social commitments

**Prompt example**:“Help me create a balanced weekly schedule. I work 9-5, Monday to Friday, have gym sessions three times a week, and need time for meal prep, cleaning, and personal projects. Include time for relaxation and socializing.”

# Step 2: The AI-generated plan

Here’s what it came up with:

**Monday-Friday**:7:00 AM - Gym9:00 AM - Start Work12:00 PM - Lunch Break5:30 PM - Meal Prep (Mon, Wed) / Personal Projects (Tue, Thu)7:00 PM - Relax (TV, reading)9:30 PM - Wind Down

**Saturday**: 

Morning: Chores (laundry, cleaning)

Afternoon: Social activity or hobby time 

Evening: Relaxation

**Sunday**: 

Morning: Meal prep for the week 

Afternoon: Planning for the upcoming week

Evening: Wind down early

Not bad, right? It even suggested alternating tasks during the week to prevent burnout.

# Step 3: Testing it out

I followed the plan for a week, and here’s what I learned:

* **The Good**:
   1. Having a pre-set structure meant no decision fatigue—I knew exactly what to do and when.
   2. It made me more consistent with gym sessions and meal prep (win!).
   3. AI scheduled enough downtime, which I sometimes forget to prioritize.
* **The Challenges**:
   1. Life happens. A last-minute meeting or a spontaneous coffee invite meant the schedule wasn’t always realistic.
   2. AI doesn’t know my energy levels. Some days, I just wasn’t up for meal-prepping after work.

# Step 4: Improving the plan

To make it more practical, I started asking the AI for flexibility:

* “Suggest alternative times for meal prep if I can’t do it in the evening.”
* “What’s the best way to stay productive when a meeting shifts my schedule?”

It adapted well! It suggested batching smaller tasks or moving workouts to a different time.

# Final Verdict

Can AI plan my week better than me? **Not quite**, but it’s a great assistant! The structure it provided helped me stay focused and reduce mental clutter. With a little tweaking, AI can be an incredible tool to organize your life.

If you’re thinking of trying this, here’s my tip: Be specific in your prompts and update the AI with changes as you go. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely worth a shot.",1,1737289451.0,GPTHackers,0,1.0,False

These are my natural nails, so needed to make sure my length was not ruined. Nail tech was great, she spent 1.5 hours alone taking off my old nail gel and prepping my nails to the damn T, then another hour doing all the painting. Free tea and coffee and sweets are standard offerings, with top ups if you wish in Russian nail salons. I went to a more ‘high end’ salon in moscow, you can get good gel for easily $20-25, just I paid extra cause she had to take off another nail tech’s work and I gave a tip because she was very good (again, tipping is not custom in Russia, only for exceptional service). 

In comparison to the UK, customer service feels better in Russia - I’m not rushed in Moscow whereas in London it often feels like a chop shop where they just want you in and out. Also cuticle maintenance is not a thing in the UK, usually I have to ask the nail tech’s in London to do it, or they try to charge extra £5-10 for what should be in my honest opinion standard work, not extra, as it heavily affects the whole quality of the nail work. Just my two cents.

Hi community! 🌱

This morning, I faced a classic challenge—spilling coffee on my carpet. Instead of panicking, I turned to a simple, natural solution, and it worked wonders! 💡See my before and after photo!!

Here’s what I did:

1️⃣ Blotted the spill immediately with a clean, dry cloth (no rubbing!).
2️⃣ Mixed warm water with a splash of vinegar and a tiny drop of dish soap.
3️⃣ Gently dabbed the mixture onto the stain using a sponge.
4️⃣ Rinsed with clean water and blotted again until dry.

For additional tips, I came across this fantastic article: [How to Clean Coffee from Carpet](https://www.proluxcleaning.co.uk/how-to-clean-coffee-from-carpet). It’s a lifesaver for anyone who loves coffee but not the stains!

Now my carpet looks spotless again, and I’m so relieved. Simple solutions really are the best. 🌟

Do you have any natural cleaning hacks to share? I’d love to hear your ideas! 😊",3,1737288850.0,CleaningTips,0,0.64,False
1i4x5u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1i4x5u5/feeling_hopeless/,Feeling hopeless,"I could use a bit of advice, I (21M) have always troubled with a fucked up self image. I’m not the tallest person at 5ft 5in (165cm) and being the shortest in every place I go took a big toll. About the weight, I used to be 70kg (155 pounds) and always told I was fat and obese. Life happend and I got to 112kg (246 pounds).
I have been forced to try many fad diets, many trends and many “tricks” (put butter in your coffee and turmeric to lose 10kg in a month) and none worked.
I had taken up a lot of energy expensive activities for a while (long walks, sailing) and more or less passively dropped to 103kg (227 pounds)
Over the past few weeks I took up counting calories seriously and adding walks. I have gotten down to 99kg (218) since I started a month ago. It just seems so slow.. I dread getting up on the scale because I don’t feel any lighter, walking is still very difficult and a bit painful after 1-2km. My plan is down to 75kg(165 pounds)at least, maybe 65kg (143 pounds).
I have started an active job on a tour boat so that keeps me active 3-4 days a week. Trying to get into diving as well. Besides walking there is nothing as an activity to do right now.. no gyms close to home (less than an hour by bus), the only one is a 20min walk but it’s over my price range. Biking is out because I don’t have one, or the budget.. and swimming will soon be an option (10-12 min walk to the beach but water is still 16°c).

From my past seeing the scale never change makes me dread the weekly weight in, which should be tomorrow. It feels crippling, I know I will feel demolished if I get on the scale and nothing changes after putting in genuine effort. What advices are there? What could I do?

1i4x5i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i4x5i6/aita_for_getting_upset_about_my_provider_husband/,AITA for getting upset about my provider husband keeping score of who offers more value in our relationship?,"My (27F) husband (32M) and I have been together for 2 years now and he’s been fully providing for me since we met. I haven’t worked at all nor does he want me to. We have a more traditional relationship where he makes a LOT of money so he provides and I cook, clean, take care of him, etc. No kids or pets.

I live an extremely easy life and will admit that first thing, and he’s also very good to me and very patient with me. However, over the last 6 months I fell into a very deep depression. This is most likely due to the medication I was taking and the severe lack of food I’ve been intaking which heavily affects hormones. After I got off of said medication, I still felt extremely depressed and constantly CONSTANTLY questioned our relationship and nitpicked my husband in my head 24/7. We got into fights where we both said nasty things to each other and the things he’s said stuck with me. 

During this time, I barely did anything at all around the house. I did just enough so that the house wasn’t messy but was still dirty — floors not vacuumed for weeks, dishes piled up for days, beard hairs all over the sinks and counters, etc. I also barely cooked. I would meal prep 30 meals for him for a few weeks and then in between these times he would end up having to DoorDash for a week straight. Inconsistency is my middle name here. Sexual intimacy was lacking as well, he would sometimes go 5+ days without me taking care of his needs so-to-speak. I was moody and checked out. Spent most days on the couch scrolling TikTok. He works from home on his computer so we are home together 24/7 and don’t leave the house much. 

As of today, I’ve been doing amazingly for about 2 weeks. Not a long time, but I feel like myself again and have been very consistent: house is clean, 3 meals a day and sometimes dessert, I bring him coffee first thing in the morning, I make sure he “gets off” at least twice a day, I go to Pilates to stay in shape and I am rather fit, I always stay “pretty”: shaved, perfumed, hair done, nails and toes done, lashes on and lingerie on around the house, etc. 
He was very patient with me during the rough time but recently when I asked money for my regularly scheduled hair appointment (I’m black and hair is expensive) he said he’s still questioning if I’ve done enough to deserve it. I have some money in savings, about $10k, but this is not liquid as I have it invested. We have joint accounts but I always ask before large expenses. I don’t ask for a lot and it’s my only big expense so I’m shocked at him telling me I need to “earn” it. The appointment is booked same time every month and he knows when my hair grows out for longer then that, I look ghetto.

I feel like it’s because he watches too much Andrew Tate because sometimes he’ll randomly get extra strict like this. That being said, I think he’s totally right. He told me that, for example, if he was to not provide for me for 6 months, I wouldn’t have tolerated it the way he tolerated my depressive episode. He’s 100% correct. That really put it into perspective for me and I feel awful about it. But his harsh words are really bothering me now and it feels weird to keep score in a relationship, but he said keeping score is one of the most important things to do in a traditional relationship otherwise I’ll keep slipping up. He said because he is the man of the household that I shouldn’t be debating this topic either so he stops listening when I try to talk about it. Am I spoiled and overreacting? AITA???

TL;DR: I was lazy for 6 months around the house but now I’m a perfect wife again yet now my provider husband is withholding funds from me until I earn them.",0,1737288801.0,AITAH,8,0.5,False
