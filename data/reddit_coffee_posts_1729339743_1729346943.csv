I'm Thomas, living in the north west of England, and I'm overall happy with my life currently.

I am guy currently in my last year of my studies, studying in the library everyday. Of course I look around who‚Äôs there but I don‚Äôt seek contact because it‚Äôs a library and everyone wants to concentrate. 

In the past few weeks there was a girl who always try to establish eye contact with me when we passed each other. Since I‚Äôm not there to date I normally wasn‚Äôt looking back more than by reflex. But in the last week the girl often sat close to me and every time she got up or sat down she looked at me straight in the eye and startet smiling. It was obviously attentional and as I said every time she had the opportunity to do so. I smiled back because I think she is very cute. This went on for three days so I decided well there‚Äôs not much more hints you can get. But I don‚Äôt like confronting people especially in a place like a library so I wrote a note: 
‚ÄúMay I invite you and your cute smile for a coffee some time? Text me if you like to: (my number)‚Äù 
I admit I was too shy to give her the note in person and it would have been weird then to not just talk to her. So I put it on her desk when she left for a break. There is no way she wouldn‚Äôt have known it was from me since I sat just a few meters away and we smiled at each other a few times before that. I even put my messenger profile pic on public so she could identify me by saving the number. 

I saw her open the note and put it away in her bag. She didn‚Äôt text me that day or the day after. Of course she might be busy or even have a boyfriend. I had a similar interaction once before with another girl who heavily smiled at me and after I invited her for a coffee (in person) she told me she‚Äôs not ready to date after a breakup. My friends told me it‚Äôs just bad luck and weird behavior by the two women but of course I‚Äôm still questioning myself and my perception.

For background and really not to brag:
I‚Äôm surely no model but I have an above average face and good physique. Women told me in serious talks that they would have been happy if I‚Äôd hit on them and in the past I was quite successful with women even though I didn‚Äôt try much since I mostly studied. I‚Äôm nearly 30 and had my share of relationships and experiences from which I learned a lot but obviously not enough.

If you're tired of tap water that tastes like a pool party gone wrong, this system could be a game-changer.

# Why APEC ROES-50?

This bad boy's got a 5-stage filtration process that kicks out 99% of the stuff you don't want in your water‚Äîthink chlorine, lead, arsenic. After setting it up (which, trust me, even a non-handy person like me can handle), the difference in water quality was *immediate*. Coffee? Tastes way better. Ice cubes? Clear as day.

# Key Features:

* **5-stage filtration**: From dust and rust to heavy metals, each stage targets specific contaminants, leaving your water tasting crisp and clean.
* **Certified quality**: WQA Gold Seal certified‚Äîbasically, it's legit.
* **Easy install**: I‚Äôm no plumber, but the instructions were foolproof. Had it up and running in an afternoon, with no leaks!

# Performance in Real Life:

50 gallons a day from this system‚Äîplenty for the fam and even guests. And it‚Äôs quiet. I‚Äôve had filters before that sound like a jet engine, but this one hums along quietly in the background.

# Pros:

* **Water tastes amazing**: No joke, I now drink *more* water.
* **Low maintenance**: Change the filters every 6-12 months and you‚Äôre good.
* **Cost-effective**: No more lugging bottled water, and the system pays for itself over time.

# Cons:

* **Takes up some space**: If you‚Äôve got a small kitchen, you‚Äôll need to make room under the sink.
* **Wastewater**: Like most reverse osmosis systems, it produces more waste water than clean, so just be mindful.

I've been dealing with a wrist injury for the past two weeks. It‚Äôs a tendon issue, and I‚Äôm having a really hard time holding anything or writing because it hurts so much. I‚Äôm already taking medication, using topical treatments, and wearing an orthopedic wrist support to help with the pain and healing.

The frustrating part is that, even though my entire family knows about my injury, it feels like my mom doesn‚Äôt care at all. I‚Äôve told her so many times how much it hurts, but she still asks me to do chores around the house, like washing dishes, making tea/coffee, or helping her move things around. She even asks me to draw her temporary tattoos because I‚Äôm good at drawing, and she needs them for when she goes out. I‚Äôve had to explain to her at least four times a day how much pain I‚Äôm in, but she just doesn‚Äôt seem to get it or care.

I haven‚Äôt told her that I‚Äôm taking meds for it because she tends to blame my health problems on the medication itself. I just feel so overwhelmed by all of this, and I don‚Äôt know what to do to make her understand the seriousness of my injury.

Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this? How do you handle it when your family doesn‚Äôt seem to support you when you‚Äôre going through something like this?",1,1729345522.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

Work, graduations, vacations, taking care of my elderly uncle from a long distance and so on.  My journey will be a year come Thanksgiving.  My goal here is to share how things go for what I consider to be a slow responder - me!

I see a nutritionist every three months (LOVE HER!) and I am at the 1.7 dosage and holding.  I intend to stay on that dosage for as long as needed.  How are things going for me?  I am down 38.5 pounds.  My starting weight was 225 and I am now at 186.5.  I am currently averaging 1/2 a pound weight loss per week, which I am thrilled with.  My challenges?  The first is food pimps.  My VERY Italian husband is a food pimp.  So is my daughter.  They both are learning, however, that no more really means no more.  My second challenge is all the 600 mile road trips back and forth to my uncles house.  I have learned to pack a cooler full of safe foods.  My nutritionist has helped me identify grab and go foods that work well with this lifestyle.  My husband also likes all the fruit I cut up and take with us along with the cheese sticks, beef jerky, and Balanced Breaks.  Graduation and a 25th anniversary cruise presented a setback from which I have recovered.

Major non scale victories include my wedding band now fitting, loose fitting size 16 jeans, a down coat I put into the closet years ago fits, and my lightweight winter coat is baggy.

What is different now than when I lost weight in the past?  The lack of near constant hunger and the reduction of the needed amount of exercise.  Do I still exercise?  Heck yes!  My dog would be devastated if I did not take him on his daily walks.  What I don‚Äôt do is target 15-20k steps per day.  I also do not put in the kind of work like I did when I was younger and owned horses.  Yes, at 16 I lost weight down to 140 pounds BUT I was waking up at 5 am, mucking stalls, grooming horses, going riding, cooling the horse down, bathing, grooming, slinging hay bales, hefting grain bags, chipping open the ice on the water tank, etc.  I would be curious to see how many calories I would burn in an average day at the age of 16 because I sure as heck was not watching my diet at that age.

Side effects?  The dreaded constipation.  I‚Äôve tried all the tricks on the board (and then some with the exception of coffee) and have settled on Miralax.  It works.

Goal weight?  Unsure.  My main goal is to be healthy.  This may look different at 50 than it did, say at 25.  My doctor and I will cross that bridge when we come to it.  Right now it is to just keep up the work.  We are both happy with slow and steady progress.

Future challenge?  Federal employee health insurance changes.  We are switching to from FEP Blue Basic to MHBP.  If they squawk at coverage, I‚Äôm switching to compounding.",1,1729345396.0,WegovyWeightLoss,0,1.0,False

Are you looking for a way to shake up your weight loss journey and improve your overall health? Intermittent fasting might be the answer you've been searching for. This popular eating pattern has gained traction among health-conscious individuals and weight loss beginners alike, offering a flexible approach to calorie control and potential health benefits. But how can you seamlessly integrate intermittent fasting into your busy lifestyle? Let's dive in and explore the world of time-restricted eating and its impact on your diet routine.

# Understanding Intermittent Fasting

Intermittent fasting isn't just another diet fad; it's a pattern of eating that alternates between periods of fasting and eating. Unlike traditional [diets](https://ebooksthatmatter.blogspot.com/2024/10/unlock-secrets-to-successful-weight.html) that focus on what you eat, intermittent fasting is all about when you eat. This approach can lead to sustainable weight loss and improved nutrition without the need for complex calorie-controlled meal plans.

# Types of Intermittent Fasting

There are several popular methods of intermittent fasting:

* **16/8 Method**: Fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window
* **5:2 Diet**: Eat normally for 5 days and restrict calories to 500-600 for 2 non-consecutive days
* **Eat-Stop-Eat**: Incorporate one or two 24-hour fasts per week

Each method offers flexibility, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your lifestyle and goals.

# Benefits Beyond Weight Loss

While many turn to intermittent fasting for [weight loss](https://ebooksthatmatter.blogspot.com/2024/10/unlock-secrets-to-successful-weight.html), its benefits extend far beyond shedding pounds. Research suggests that this eating pattern may:

* Improve insulin sensitivity
* Boost cellular repair processes
* Enhance brain function
* Reduce inflammation

These potential health benefits make intermittent fasting an attractive option for those looking to improve their overall well-being.

# Getting Started with Intermittent Fasting

# Choosing Your Fasting Schedule

Selecting the right fasting schedule is crucial for success. Consider your daily routine, work schedule, and personal preferences. For busy people, the 16/8 method might be the most manageable, as it often involves simply skipping breakfast and eating between noon and 8 PM.

# Easing Into Fasting

If you're new to fasting, start slowly. Begin by pushing your breakfast back by an hour each day until you reach your desired fasting window. This gradual approach helps your body adjust and minimizes potential side effects like hunger pangs or irritability.

# Crafting Your Eating Window

# Balanced Meal Plans for Optimal Nutrition

During your eating window, focus on nutrient-dense, whole foods. A balanced meal plan should include:

* Lean proteins
* Healthy fats
* Complex carbohydrates
* Plenty of fruits and vegetables

This approach ensures you're getting the necessary nutrients even with a restricted eating timeframe.

# Portion Control and Mindful Eating

While intermittent fasting can naturally lead to reduced [calorie intake](https://ebooksthatmatter.blogspot.com/2024/10/unlock-secrets-to-successful-weight.html), it's still important to practice portion control. Use smaller plates, eat slowly, and listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues.

# Meal Prep: Your Secret Weapon

Meal preparation is a game-changer when it comes to sticking to your intermittent fasting routine. By planning and preparing your meals in advance, you can:

* Save time during busy weekdays
* Ensure you have healthy options readily available
* Avoid impulsive food choices during your eating window

# Simple Meal Prep Ideas

* Cook large batches of grains and proteins
* Pre-cut vegetables for quick stir-fries or salads
* Prepare overnight oats for a quick break-fast meal

[SelfCareSquad](https://preview.redd.it/98sx4kiavpvd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9de4bff1322febea9b80e4deec8f1b139a3cd95)

# Grocery Shopping for Success

A well-stocked kitchen is essential for maintaining your intermittent fasting routine. Create a shopping list that focuses on:

* Fresh produce
* Lean meats and fish
* Whole grains
* Healthy snacks for your eating window

By having nutritious options on hand, you're less likely to reach for processed foods when hunger strikes.

# Adapting Popular Diets to Intermittent Fasting

Intermittent fasting can be combined with other popular dietary approaches for enhanced results:

# Mediterranean Diet + Intermittent Fasting

Incorporate the heart-healthy principles of the Mediterranean diet into your eating window:

* Olive oil as the primary fat source
* Plenty of fish and seafood
* Moderate amounts of poultry and dairy
* Limited red meat consumption

# Plant-Based Diet + Intermittent Fasting

For those following a plant-based lifestyle, intermittent fasting can be a powerful addition:

* Focus on legumes, nuts, and seeds for protein
* Include a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables
* Choose whole grains over refined carbohydrates

# Low-Carb Diet + Intermittent Fasting

Combining a low-carb approach with intermittent fasting can accelerate ketosis and fat burning:

* Emphasize healthy fats like avocados and nuts
* Include moderate amounts of protein
* Limit carbohydrates to non-starchy vegetables

# Overcoming Common Challenges

# Dealing with Hunger

Hunger is a natural part of fasting, but there are ways to manage it:

* Stay hydrated with water, black coffee, or herbal tea
* Keep busy during fasting periods
* Gradually increase fasting duration to allow your body to adapt

# Maintaining Social Life

Don't let intermittent fasting isolate you socially. Instead:

* Adjust your eating window to accommodate social events
* Choose fasting days that don't conflict with your social calendar
* Be open with friends and family about your eating pattern

# Tracking Your Progress

Monitoring your journey can help you stay motivated and make necessary adjustments:

* Use a food diary or app to log your meals
* Track your weight and measurements regularly
* Note any changes in energy levels or overall well-being

# When to Consult a Professional

While intermittent fasting can be safe for many, it's not suitable for everyone. Consult a registered dietitian or nutrition expert if:

* You have a history of eating disorders
* You're pregnant or breastfeeding
* You have diabetes or other chronic health conditions

A meal planning specialist can help you create a personalized approach that aligns with your health goals and dietary needs.

# Sustainable Weight Loss and Long-Term Success

Remember, intermittent fasting is not a quick fix but a lifestyle change. For sustainable weight loss:

* Focus on creating healthy eating habits
* Incorporate regular physical activity
* Be patient and consistent with your chosen fasting method

# Conclusion

Incorporating intermittent fasting into your diet routine can be a powerful tool for weight loss and improved health. By choosing the right fasting schedule, focusing on nutritious meals during your eating window, and preparing for success with meal prep and smart grocery shopping, you can make [intermittent fasting](https://ebooksthatmatter.blogspot.com/2024/10/unlock-secrets-to-successful-weight.html) a sustainable part of your lifestyle. Remember to listen to your body, stay flexible, and consult with healthcare professionals when needed. Are you ready to give intermittent fasting a try? Start small, stay consistent, and watch as this simple change transforms your approach to eating and overall well-being

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the caf√©: Love & Coffee.

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The caf√©‚Äôs simple elegance, with its white and brown d√©cor, felt inviting.

(Prologue) ,"Meet Trace, a young ordinary white-collar worker who spends his time in the office doing tasks and handling out papers. His wife Saria is a kind and loving young woman who's friendly to others. They live together in a dingbat apartment somewhere in the Venice district of Los Angeles. His colleagues describe him as hard-working, dedicated, and friendly guy who gets the job done. 

Trace first met Saria when they used to work at Walmart back in 1988. They started dating ever since and soon got married by December, 1990.



\[October 15, 1991\]



On that faithful night, Trace and Saria are headed back to their car after watching a movie. They were soon stopped by a wolf keidran who robbed them at gunpoint. As she hands her purse to the wolf keidran, he demanded Trace to give up his wallet but Trace fights back and attempts to reach the gun from the wolf keidran which went horribly wrong as Saria ended up getting shot in the abdomen moments later. Trace is shocked and rushes to help her before being knocked unconscious by the wolf keidran who had pistol whipped him and flees the area. Trace soon wakes up in a hospital bed, the doctors sadly informed him that Saria did not make it due to a large amount of blood loss from her injuries. He didn't believe them at first until they brought him to the morgue where she is lying lifeless. By the time he was discharged from the hospital, Trace is left grieving and couldn't accept Saria's fate. He always felt depressed and wanted to forget that faithful night. 



\[March, 1993\]



2 years after Saria's death, Trace had been falling behind of schedule from his job. One of the office-mates often seen him as quiet, emotionless, and sleep deprived type who falls behind from other workers. There was one incident that happened a month ago where he lashes out and beats up a keidran coworker who accidentally spilled coffee on his paperwork. Trace got suspended for a week and had half of his pay reduced. 



About one evening, Trace just finished working on a late shift. He grabs his suitcase and takes the elevator to the lobby. As he reaches his car and packs his things, he heard a woman's voice yelling for help.



""HELP! HELP!! I'M BEING CARJACKED! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!!""



Trace has to act fast but it's gonna be a risky move. He grabs a tire iron from his car and runs towards the direction where the voice came from. By the time Trace got there,  he saw a female tiger keidran who's fighting back as the carjacker tries pulling her out from the car. 



""Hey! Get your hands off her you sick bastard!"" Trace stepped in and attacks the guy, tackling him to the ground and repeatedly beating him up til he gives up and runs away. 



""Are you alright, miss? Don't worry, that guy won't hurt you for now."" Trace said. The tiger keidran remained silent for a moment until she hugged him.



""Nya! You saved me! You saved me.. Thank you, Trace!""



""H-How did you know my name?"" Trace asked.



""Umm.. You do know that you have that ID card thingy on your shirt?""



""Oh right.. You should be more aware of your surroundings since it gets usually dangerous to places like these during the dead of night."" Trace said.



""You seemed like a nice guy, Mr. Trace! I owe you a big one.""



""That's great to hear but I better keep going. Just stay safe out there!"" Trace said, he heads back to his car and drives home, unaware that he is being followed. Upon arrival, he walked in, dropped his things, and went to bed.



When morning arrived, Trace wonders all of a sudden he feels something warm on his bed, he wakes up and discovers the same female tiger keidran from last night that he saved, now on the same bed next to him.

Did you know: more people listen to you if you start with ‚Äúdid you know‚Äù now that you're somewhat hooked I'd love to tell you some stories, but this isn't a normal story book, I hate normal, these stories are about my death! I'm Cosmo by the way if the title didn't tell you, a famous pop star that has everything somewhat put together, i die a few hundred times but because of plot points and money keeps being brung back. Since i'm feeling nice I'll give you a hint on the story: badly built buildings. That's a pretty good hint, it makes you think ‚Äúhe falls through the floor and dies‚Äù or ‚Äúhe tries to fix something on the roof and falls off‚Äù i'm not saying thats wrong but i'm not saying it's right. This is all over the place isn't it? Sorry my author is on a time crunch, lets just have a small chat while my author calms down:



‚ÄúHello! My name is Cosmo, what's yours?‚Äù ‚Äú\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_‚Äù



‚ÄúThat's a great name, how are you feeling about this book so far?‚Äù



‚Äú\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_‚Äù



‚ÄúI really hope you said good because my author ate an entire bag of mints trying to come up with the idea!‚Äù



That was kinda lame, you can't talk directly to me, you can write in the lines but i can't read that because its not printed! Gosh I hate rules, especially writing rules! Dont tell my author how to write me! Speaking of my author, i checked on them (because i'm not heartless like they say i am) and they chugged a cup of coffee before writing this next part, so, sorry if it seems worse than it already is

  


How to title chapters ¬†



Wow, isn't my author sooooo great at titles? Also I don't think that counted as a chapter. Anyway i think i should come up with a name for you since i'm tired of calling you ‚Äúreader‚Äù i'll call you‚Ä¶ no mouth. That seems good because you can't speak to me, but you could if you write more stories about me and if you summon me! Just get some blue paint (my favorite color!) and paint yourself here ‚Äî>

(told by the author NOT cosmo)¬†

  


Cosmo king, loved by all for his fame and wealth but his perfect life would soon come to an end. Like any other boring, slow cold, rainy day he was writing lyrics for his newest song that has yet to have a title. The bolts of his home-made-home squealed as the rain slammed into the roof which for anyone is more annoying than a six year old running in a nice restaurant. ‚ÄúUgh where's my assistant when I actually need him!‚Äù Cosmo whined to himself, his ex assistant, Joseph Bowman, left to pursue his art career last month and cosmo (altho hating to think about it) missed him dearly. ‚ÄúI'll fix it later‚Äù cosmo said as he wrote it down in his notes, but he would be too late. The bolts squeaked louder. Some people worry at any sound, worried it would fall and crush them like a measly ant in the middle of a bedroom or break like a vase, the people like that may seem ‚Äútoo worryful‚Äù but they're far smarter than the poor soul in his living room. Just like a worryful person's imagination, the roof came crashing down and hardly missed cosmo, he shrieked and jumped away onto the floor ‚ÄúWHAT THE no swearing!¬† ¬†!?‚Äú (i cut what he said out, i am in school after all.) he ran to the door but was blocked by another chunk of roof. ‚ÄúI can't die! I'm only twenty!‚Äù he cried as he ran to find someplace to exit the building



Thank the lord he found a small window that was smashed, he squeezed himself through, the glass cutting his thin limbs leaving his blue shirt splattered with red. As he got out he was bleeding onto the grass, the rain falling onto him along with his wounds. ‚ÄúI-i‚Äôm alive!‚Äù he yelled, the adrenaline still rushing through his veins and his thoughts rushing through faster, but he was alive, he nearly got crushed but he didn't. He grabbed his phone out of his pocket, cracked and suffered some water damage but worked enough for him to call some builders to fix his home that he loved so dearly and booked himself a hotel since his home was in shambles. He checked his cuts, they were still gushing with blood but thankfully not deep enough to waver a hospital visit, especially in this economy, hospital bills are so high he can hardly afford it, and he's famous!

¬†As he walked to the hotel because he can't drive he remembered his beloved ex bodyguard, *his smile that he hardly showed could light up a room. His posture, he always had his back straight as a ruler. When they first met was in highschool, cosmo was in theater and joseph was in art club. They often had to work together because joseph was tasked with building the play sets, the two hit it off after joseph couldn't come up with anything, cosmo had the imagination of a toddler hyped up on sugar, he could come up with ideas faster then he could write! After highschool they didn't talk much till cosmo was rose to fame and desperately needed a bodyguard-*

‚ÄúSir! You're bleeding!‚Äù his thought was interrupted by the hotel manager. ‚ÄúOh!- yes my house fell apart and i hardly got out, i need a room- and maybe a bandage?‚Äù he responded, sorrow filling his voice ‚Äúoh of course honey, right this way!‚Äù She quickly led him to a back room where she bandaged his cuts and helped pull some glass from his skin. ‚ÄúThere we go, a room is $66 dollars per night‚Äù she explained, putting the medical kit away in a nearby cubby ‚Äúdoes this place take card?‚Äù ‚Äúdoesn't¬† everywhere?‚Äù She scanned his card at the front desk and gave him the key to his room. It was small, on the third floor and probably dirty like all hotel rooms but better than a fallen roof! He threw himself on the bed, wanting nothing more than a few hours of rest, but he knew he would get nothing of the sort, he hasn't slept well since his bodyguard left him and he couldnt put his finger on why, why he couldn't sleep without a guard on a cot nearby. Maybe he-

**CRASH!** The roof caved in just as it did in his home, he couldn't escape through a window from being so high up, and he didn't get lucky as before, he didn't even make it out of the bed before the ceiling crushed him like an ant. Nobody saw it coming and as a piece of ceiling bashed into cosmos head, the only thing that was going through his head wasn't survival, it wasn't a hatred for ceilings or even the ceiling itself, no, the only thing going through his head was his beloved bodyguard. Buried under the rubble of the hotel, cosmo could have sworn he saw joseph's car pulling up to the scene before everything going black and the loud ringing in his ears coming to a halt

(authors note: hey its me the author of this amazing short story! Sorry if it's not what you had in mind, I hate staying in the lines of society. I've always wanted to write a story like this but my last year teacher would make me basically start over if i tried to be different with my writing, also i will try to write more stories about cosmo because i'm the author and if i want him suddenly alive he's going to be suddenly alive XD, also if you couldn't tell this is my first time writing something i WANT to write about so its probably better than all my other projects.

1g793q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1g793q5/long_mac_take_a_step_back/,long mac (take a step back),"for context, i work at a cafe as a server/waitress

tf is perth coffee culture??? because why was i at work today and some huge assholish white dude in formal attire come in and order a ""large long mac topped up with non-milk""?? i was so confused like do you want lactose free milk? or one of the other six non-dairy milks we have??? and he goes ""i said non milk. I want a foam that doesnt have any milk""

at first i think he's kidding because white dudes love to gaslight coloured women into thinking they're stupid then passing it off as a ""joke"", but he was completely genuine so i asked if he had ordered that anywhere else before and what they gave him, and he replied ""nah i usually get a normal long mac topped up but I don't feel like having milk today, could you do like a water foam?"" 

a water foam. he wants *foamy water*. I tell him that the only possible way for that to happen was to mix dish soap with the water, which we cant do because duh. he gets mad enough to imitate a white woman in her thirties whose husband asked for spicy food, yelling at me, all up in my face for not understanding. i'm 5'2 and fairly non-threatening, but i try to explain that the best I can do is a long black, which is a double shot with hot water and basically exactly what he wants without ""water foam"". 

""why can't you foam water? thats what i asked for"" because physics you overgrown larva. i say fuck it and order him a long black, since he's holding up the line, and deign to just shake the takeaway cup before i gov it to him. he leaves, but not without muttering something about ""useless immigrants"". i nearly stopped him because i was literally born here lmao but yeah thats how my mediocre day got worse.

my point here is, why are people in perth always making up coffee orders that don't exist, or asking dumb questions just so they can pretend they're better than everyone else? like ma'am i cant order you a ""cappuccino milkshake"" but we do have a coffee frappe if you want? no, our babycino does not have caffeine. no, the milk in your iced latte will not be steamed. why does this keep happening? has anyone else experienced ridiculous coffee orders?",6,1729345044.0,perth,2,0.62,False
1g793fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1g793fn/a_single_tiny_leaf/,A single tiny leaf,"The leaf began its slow, inevitable fall from the towering oak tree in the heart of a quiet park. It had once been vibrant and green, basking in the summer sun, but now, in late autumn, it was brittle and golden, barely clinging to the branch. A gentle breeze swept through the park, loosening the stem's last grip, and the leaf drifted silently toward the ground.



---



It fluttered in the wind, swaying back and forth until it landed softly on a cobblestone path, right in the path of a young man named Andrew. He was walking through the park, lost in thought, his hands deep in his coat pockets. As he approached, his foot hovered inches above the leaf. In a small, almost imperceptible act of instinct, Andrew shifted his step, narrowly avoiding the leaf. This tiny movement threw off his balance just slightly, making him stumble to the side. At that moment, his gaze shifted, and he saw her.



Sitting on a bench, a few paces away, was a woman reading a book. Their eyes met for a fleeting moment before Andrew, embarrassed by his clumsiness, quickly looked away. But something inside him urged him to glance back. There was something familiar, something magnetic about her. Without thinking, he changed direction and walked toward the bench.



---



That woman was Sarah. She had come to the park to escape the noise of the city, hoping for a moment of peace. When Andrew approached her, she was hesitant at first, but they struck up a conversation, which turned into a coffee date the next day. Over the following weeks, their connection deepened, and soon, they were inseparable.



Had Andrew stepped on that leaf, his day would have continued uninterrupted. He would have never met Sarah. But because of that leaf, they found each other. A year later, they were married.



---



Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Emma, who would grow up to become a renowned scientist. Emma‚Äôs research into renewable energy sources would one day lead to a breakthrough that could potentially reverse the effects of climate change. Her discovery would save countless lives and reshape the future of the planet.



---



Thirty years after that fateful day in the park, Emma gave a lecture in Tokyo on her findings. In the audience sat a young entrepreneur named Hiroshi. Inspired by her work, he decided to invest in the development of green technologies. His company would go on to become a global leader in sustainable innovations, helping the world transition away from fossil fuels.



At the same conference, a journalist named Maria was covering the event. She would later write an article that would inspire governments across the globe to enact sweeping environmental policies. One of these policies would prevent the construction of a harmful chemical plant in a small village in South America.



---



In that village lived a boy named Javier. Without the plant‚Äôs pollution poisoning the river, Javier grew up healthy and strong. He became a teacher, and his passion for education ignited a movement that led to the creation of new schools throughout his country. Many of his students would go on to become doctors, engineers, and leaders, lifting their communities out of poverty.

Homecoming dresses, bets, and DDR.

Greetings all. I'm back again with another story about my adventures. I know my last tale was underwhelming, but it was primarily an introduction to the two beardos I found myself stuck between my freshman year.

To clarify a couple of things. My home life wasn't exactly sunshine and rainbows. I was pretty much on constant lock down until I turned 15 and my mom realized that it was either loosen up, or deal with a rebellious little demon. Spoiler alert. I still rebeled anyway.

Her boyfriend, who I'll be refering to as Nam (He was a Vietnam veteran, and proud of it), was a verbally, mentally, emotionally, and on occasion physically abusive towards me, from the time I was 11 until my mom finally gave him the boot when I was 17. He was the first person to ever call me a whore. When I was 12, because I was wearing tinted lip balm my mom had let me use. So, yeah. 

When I started high school, I also started to spend more time isolating myself in my room away from my parental figures, and used that time to scroll through the Book of Faces, play around on GaiaOnline, watch anime on YouTube when I could find it, listen to music, read, and in general keep myself busy.

Anywhooo. Onto our story.

The cast!

V. That's me! A 14 year old redneck goth girl who was slowly coming out of the socially anxious shell I carry around. 5ft 2in at the time, kinda chubby, long dark blond hair. I spoke slowly and deliberately to keep my rather thick native Texan drawl a bit more under wraps. I was also realizing I felt more comfortable around the guys who cared about games, talking nerd stuff, and being well....guys.

Scout. The neckbeard. A 17 year old senior who I found out had a thing for me. Skinny short dude with long blond hair. Obsessed with the scout from TF2. President of my schools anime club and my eventual boyfriend.

Loli. The legbeard. A 16 year old junior who forcefully befriended me in middle school. Materialistic leech. Super long dark hair, overweight, loud, and I realized not too long after this, not my actual friend.

Emo-boi. A 15 year old sophmore. Looked like the old school MySpace era emo guys. The first person to ever show me Magic the Gathering. Angsty bag of drama. He and I were both kinda quiet, and I would sit with him and watch him play with other members of The Group.

The Group. A group of anime nerds who made up the entirety of the schools anime club. I still don't remember everyone who was in involved with them, but I was starting to slowly fit in. A few of them spoke to me regularly, and the rest left me alone. We had cliques in a clique. It was a weird time. I don't remember the names of some of them, so they're gonna be refered to as Boy/Girl.

Thor. A totally normal 14 year old guy. Doesn't really play a huge part in this story much, but he was my semi-consistant confidant. He knew what was going on at home, but by this point we were starting to drift. He had his friends, I had mine. I lost a super dumb bet to him.

Character unlocked! Tuner. Another freshman like me in my biology class. Slightly neckbeard-esque, would get more beardy as time went on. Super into tuner import cars, classic rock, and ended up being my shadow throughout the rest of high school. Nerd adjacent who would end up a fellow goth kid.

On to the story, for real this time.

About a month and a half or so had passed, and I was slowly becoming more comfortable with The Group, as well as my classmates. I still usually had my nose buried in a book with my earbuds in, but I was willing to engage socially a little more. The week of homecoming had been a spectical, to say the least. Mums were worn (if you don't know what that is, Google it. I can't really explain it very well outside of ""its a Texas thing""), we won the football game that my mom kicked me out of the house to attend, and the dance had been enjoyable as well.  Now it was just more gossip fodder. 

Loli had been talking to one of the other girls, assuming I couldn't hear her despite the volume at which she spoke. She had slowly been turning from friend to foe, ever since the incident with the dress. I've never figured out why she suddenly had an issue with me, and it'll probably be that way until the sun implodes. Her latest nitpick was at me being poor. I'll give her this much, she could hold a grudge.

Loli- I can't believe V wore a thrift store dress. So tacky. I wouldn't be caught dead in thrifted clothes.

Girl- It looked cute on her though. It was kinda vintage, like from the 90s.

I had worn a thrifted dress and shoes to the dance. The dress was an ankle length black velvet number, with large red roses printed on it. It fit me nicely and I got it for an insane bargain. Like, $8 or something. The shoes got a strong dose of Lysol, but were comfortable for my non-heel wearing self. Loli had worn an ill-fitting eggplant purple dress that looked like it was supposed to be a mermaid skirt, but it started at her crotch rather than her knees.

Loli- Whatever. At least my dress was new. And I actually had a date.

She had pressured one of the other guys to take her by never leaving him alone until he agreed. I just went alone. I had danced with a few people, a slow dance with Thor, and in general tried pretending I was a kid in some teen movie. It felt awkward, but everyone else seemed happy, so I just went with it.

Girl- Yeah it was kinda sad no one asked her, but she looked like she was having fun. I think I saw her actually smile.

Loli- Her? Smile? Ew. That's a creepy thought. I don't think her face even knows how to do that.

I typically just kind of had a blank face. I thought if i kept my face neutral, that people would see me as a part of the wallpaper. Relaxed features, tired looking eyes due to a shitty sleep schedule, and typically lost in either a book, music or my own head. It was pretty uncommon for me to smile or laugh, mostly because those things brought attention, and I didn't want attention. They changed topics to some anime that had just come out, and Loli was gushing about how ""Kawaii"" one of the male characters was. However, I had enough of her yapping and just moved over to where Emo-boi and Scout were playing MTG and quietly watched. I sat my backpack in my lap between my body and the table, and was using it as a makeshift chin rest.

Emo-boi- Hey, don't let her bug you. I don't know what her deal is, but she'll lay off eventually.

V- It's because I wouldn't make her a dress she had a picture of. I don't really care anymore. She can be mad.

Scout- She's been like that forever. She'll usually try to get someone to take pity on her for food too. Not like she needs it. V, you've known her a long time. Was she like that in middle school?

V- Eh? She kinda became my friend by just always showing up to hang out. We had some stuff in common, but we only really hung out when she was in 8th grade. After that she didn't have time to hang out with me.

We chit chat a little more until the bell rings. I had History that day, and Thor cashed in on a bet I had lost before homecoming. He told me that I had to go a whole day without wearing my goth styled clothes. I groaned, but agreed. A deal was a deal. The rest of that day was more of the same until Biology. We had been assigned our lab partners and I was partnered with Tuner. That day, he looked kinda down and I found out that another guy in our class had made fun of his cat dying. Now, I have a massive soft spot for animals, and I told him I was really sorry. When one of that guys friends came over to throw another jab, I decided that the kid on the verge of tears needed a helping hand.

Jerk- Heard about your dead cat. Probably died to get away from you.

V- Fuck off. I get that you don't understand what love is, because if I had to guess, mommy and daddy were too shit faced to use a condom and now here you are. Go jerk your boyfriend over there off and leave Tuner alone.

That was the most I had spoken to anyone in that class without basically being forced to,  but I don't like bullies. I had been bullied through elementary and middle school, and I didn't want to stand by and watch it happen. I had also been so annoyed that my drawl had slipped out because I wasn't thinking before I spoke. That sound got me called an inbred, and my cussing had gotten the teachers attention. Looks like I had detention after school the next time they held detention. Tuner seemed to perk up though, so it had been worth it.

Two days later, I showed up in the only ""not goth"" clothes I owned. A plain grey tshirt, jeans, a blue hoodie and a pair of knock off converse. I even did some different makeup. That morning as I drank my coffee, Nam made a comment about me looking normal that I ignored, and got backhanded for. His college ring had left a red mark that Thor noticed when I got to school. I gave him a non-verbal cue to leave it alone. I didn't want to talk about it.

I spent that morning with him and his friends, to whom I was acquainted with from middle school. They were cool guys, just more jock-ish than nerdy, so we didn't have much to talk about. The bell rang and we scattered like roaches to our various classes. Eventually History rolls around and the red mark has faded away from my cheek.

Thor- You look nice outside the goth stuff. Why do you wear it?

I kinda just shrugged in response, mulling over the question. At my silence, he asked about my face.

Thor- Did he hit you again? You really need to tell your mom, or a teacher. 

V- I can't. Mom won't believe me, plus if he leaves her, we'll end up homeless. It's not that bad anyway. Promise. By the way, I wear the goth stuff because it's self expression. Goth culture is about seeing the beauty in darkness, and I guess if I can embrace that, then maybe I'll be beautiful too.

In middle school, we had uniforms so Thor didn't really know I was a goth kid outside of school. It wasn't until I posted pictures of myself on my Facebook page that he got to see what I looked like outside of school. I was dealing with some self confidence and esteem issues that I still struggle with. The goth style was an outlet for me, and I still like it today, but it's too hot in Texas to wear 24/7.

Thor- Well I think you look nice anyway.

At this, the middle school crush flared up and I did my best not to blush and swoon. He was one of the few friends I had, so I didn't want to mess that up by making it weird. Instead I just stopped talking and focused on the workbook.

After a while, it's lunch again. I found my usual seat at the table with The Group, earbuds in place and just wanting to be left alone. Thor asking about my face had been upsetting, and I was stuck in my own head. Stuck in that dark place that screamed vitriol at me. Stupid, ugly, useless. Better off gone. No one would care. Right?

I got torn out of my mind by someone pulling my earbud out and saw Scout sitting next to me, with a big shit eating grin on his face.

Scout: Hey V.

V:....Huh? What's up?

Scout: Nothing. You good?

V: Yeah I'm fine, I guess. Just not sleeping much. Noisy neighbors.

Scout: Gotcha.... So... I was wondering if you'd wanna hang out some time? We could go to the mall. The arcade there is pretty neat. They have DDR.

I didn't realize it at the time, but this was him asking me out. I hadn't knowingly been the object of affection from the opposite sex ever, until that point, and the idea of spending time with people when it wasn't a requirement was both enticing and terrifying. He and I had talked during club times, before school, and obviously at lunch, so I wasn't completely shocked with him talking to me, but I do remember thinking it was annoying for him to pull my earbud out.

V: Oh uh....I'd have to ask my mom, but it should be ok, I think.

Scout: Cool. This Saturday work for you?

V: I have some stuff to do in the morning, but I should be good for the afternoon.

By this point, my odd jobs had been moved to weekends. I had a job to wash and detail a family friend's truck, and I had my chores to do.

Scout: Cool. Can I see your phone? I can give you my number and we can figure out the details better.

I do as I'm asked, and he puts his number in my phone. I had a super basic flip phone, and I was pretty boring so there was nothing exciting he could have snooped for.

Scout: There we go. You're gonna be floored with how awesome I am at DDR. Maybe we can play together and I'll let you win.

V: I like racing games more honestly. I'm kinda clumsy so DDR isn't really a game I play very much.

He apparently didn't know what to say to that, so instead he moved back to his original seat. I went back to my book and my lunch. The last couple of classes and detention that day have been lost to time.

At the end of the day, I unlocked my bike, and wanting to avoid home, I shot my mom a text to let her know I was gonna run a couple of quick errands. I rode over a local bookstore and picked up a new (used) book. I was 3/4 of the way through the one I was reading, and was on a massive Stephen King kick. I think I got a copy of Carrie. Fitting, huh? I also went to the local parts store and picked up a couple of things I was out of for my upcoming job. 

Eventually, I had to go home. I knew Nam was gonna scream at me because of detention. Thankfully, when I had told my mom what happened, she wasn't happy with me, but respected me for standing up for someone else. Walking inside, I put my detailing stuff in the box I used, trying to stay quiet enough for Nam not to notice me. Our front door led into the kitchen, and the living room was separated by a wall and one of those slatted accordion doors, and he had the volume on the TV up so he couldn't hear the door unless I slammed it. I managed to sneak past him and into my room, hoping to stay in hiding until my mom came home. No such luck. My door flew opened and he screamed at me. Accused me of ""staying out late chasing boys"" and ""being a street walker"". It was about 6:30, and still daylight out.

V: I had detention, and had to pick up more detailing spray for *Redacted*s truck that I'm detailing on Saturday.

Nam: I knew it. You're just some fucking degenerate. Get caught blowing someone at school?

V: What? No. The teacher heard me cussing someone out. A kid was getting picked on and I stood up for him.

Nam: Yeah right. You stupid little slut. Stay in here until your mother gets home and she can deal with you.

At that, he slammed the door, which caused me to jump. I had already planned on staying in my room. I sat at my desk, booting up my laptop for some music and working on the homework I didn't finish in detention. By that point, this had been going on for 3 years. While it hurt me, yeah, I had mostly become numb to it. I refused to cry, so instead I IMed Thor to have some illusion of company. I think I asked him about some question on our history homework that I pretended not to understand to start the conversation.

After a while, mom came home. She and I made dinner and nothing more was said about me coming home late. Nam was a split personality. Cruel and abusive to me when it was just me and him, indifferent when my mom was around. Over dinner, I told my mom about my day when Nam was out of the room

V: I got asked out on a date today. Saturday afternoon.

Mom: Really? That's good. Where did he want to take you?

V: Just to the mall. Maybe have some lunch, hang out at the arcade. Do you think you can give me a ride? I already told him I have plans for the morning and that I'd ask if it was OK with you.

Mom: Sure. Just make sure you get your work done with time to come home and clean up. No boy wants to go out with a girl that smells like New Car.

I smiled and agreed. Thankfully, even though my mom didn't understand my interests or really know what was going on when she wasn't around, she did her best. Our relationship never was the best as she was more wrapped up in her boyfriends and work than her kid, but sometimes she tried. Mostly though, I think she wanted a little clone of herself because she did still push her style, interests, and opinions on me. Many years later, I would see her become vitriollic and jaded towards me, but that's a different story for a later date.

That day sticks out because of a few things. It was the first time I stole a pack of cigarettes from my mom (who still buys them by the carton), and started smoking, first time I snuck out of my bedroom window after my parents went to bed. I didn't really go anywhere l, just walked out of the bushes and stood near the window, and as I stared at the lighter, I remember debating on if I would hurt myself or not. The urge was there, but I didn't indulge in it. Not yet, anyway.

Sorry for the darker ending, but that year things started to slowly take a turn in my life, and to understand me, and why I fell in with beards a lot, I have to retell these events as I remember them. I want to ease your concerns by telling you that I did, obviously survive these days, and I'm a strong, happier person these days. I have a few battle scars sure, but I'm still here. The next story is a bit more light hearted I think, and I hope you enjoyed this tale as well as you can",1,1729344878.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the caf√© began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn‚Äôt even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration‚Äîone I hadn‚Äôt heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

‚ÄúDrea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought‚Äî""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn‚Äôt want to drag you into my mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúMessed up?‚Äù I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I‚Äôm so sorry, Drea. I promise, I‚Äôm not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren‚Äôt alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. ‚ÄúOh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids‚ÄîIsla and Josh.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? ‚ÄúOh... hi,‚Äù I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Isla‚Äôs third birthday today,‚Äù Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

‚ÄúHappy Birthday, Isla,‚Äù I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúThank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!‚Äù

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. ‚ÄúYes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.‚Äù

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch up with you later, Adrian,‚Äù I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian‚Äôs family lingering for Isla‚Äôs birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the caf√© and mentally kicked myself. I‚Äôd forgotten to get Adrian‚Äôs number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn‚Äôt managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

‚ÄúDrea,‚Äù a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. ‚ÄúI was just coming to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdrian?‚Äù I blinked, surprised. ‚ÄúI thought you left hours ago.‚Äù

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. ‚ÄúI did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.‚Äù

I nodded, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúYeah, we do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to take a walk?‚Äù

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn‚Äôt want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Adrian‚Äôs voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. ‚ÄúYou got married.‚Äù

I shot him a sideways glance. ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? It was all over the news. Didn‚Äôt you see it?‚Äù

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù

He laughed softly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You‚Äôve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.‚Äù

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn‚Äôt lie to him. Not after everything we‚Äôd been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real, Adrian.‚Äù

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a business deal,‚Äù I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. ‚ÄúMy parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.‚Äù

Adrian‚Äôs expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. ‚ÄúDrea‚Ä¶‚Äù

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Adrian. I am. I‚Äôve learned to deal with it.‚Äù

His jaw clenched. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn‚Äôt have let this happen.‚Äù

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. You couldn‚Äôt have known.‚Äù

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn‚Äôt work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here?‚Äù

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed‚Äîthough I couldn‚Äôt quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just come inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe door‚Ä¶ it wouldn‚Äôt open,‚Äù I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. ‚ÄúDid you try using your fingerprint?‚Äù

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. ‚ÄúUnbelievable. Now we‚Äôre locked out.‚Äù He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn‚Äôt help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he‚Äôd let me in‚Äîboth literally and figuratively.

Makes better coffee than 99% of the cafes around here. But after nearly 2 months, I still don't feel like the coffee I'm making is nearly as good as the beans I'm buying. There is always too much bitterness or sourness or both, and I don't feel I'm getting the flavors that I'm looking for, despite endlessly dialing in. Not the fruity side with the more fruity medium roasts and not the more nutty/chocolaty with the darker roasts. Looking for more complex and sweeter flavors and a more balanced cup.

So I'm wondering if it's worth upgrading to a Flair 58 to have better control of temperature and pressure. Also would really like to try lighter roasts which I totally gave up on with the pico. Is it reasonable to believe I'll get a better cup from the flair? Anyone have both and can compare?

Me and my wife are hoping to visit Sarajevo next month for a week. We are coming mainly to learn about the history of Bosnia and hoping to visit many of the museums. The rest of the time we hope to try local food and explore the city. I was hoping to get help with some questions:

1. Can we depend on public transport to get around the city or is a rental car recommended?

2. If public transport is easily accessible, where is the best area to stay in Sarajevo with easy access to public transport?

3. I am guessing halal food is everywhere in Sarajevo. Please correct me if I am wrong. Information on google for a lot of restaurants does not mention if it is halal or not. Are there any recommended restaurants where we can try halal local food? 

4. I can get breakfast option if I book a hotel. Is there a culture of having breakfast outside or would it just be better to have it at the hotel. I would personally like to go to a local establishment to have traditional breakfast rather than western style hotel breakfast. 

5. Are there things to do late night in Sarajevo, like are there tea places where you can sit down to have tea/coffee?

6. Are there any cultural norms and traditions that you would want a foreigner to be particularly mindful of? We are visiting from the UK and as guests in your country we want to make sure we do not cause inconvenience. We are very much looking forward to visiting.

1g78pp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1g78pp7/we_can_make_a_change/,We CAN make a change.,"Hi, I reckon we should advocate for the complete abolishment of money and a complete change for work, no longer being forced to work to survive but rather having a choice to work those jobs, especially for those who are rather passionate for those positions whereas mundane tasks done at our home such as growing our own crops, cleaning the floor when needed, personally helping a neighbor with chores, walking the dog and a ton more are the primary focus of getting by while doing it at our own pace, rather than forcibly slaving away to a traditional 9 - 5 job that makes you feel that you have no worth other than to work, the job doesn't even give you enough money to get by and the majority of it will pretty much get eaten up by taxes anyways.

We are now in dark times, especially with the overwhelming cost of living that suffocates us relentlessly, I can't let this go on any longer. Are we really just gonna depend on the governments running the show? They can't really do anything without their precious load of paper money or digits. Not to mention that the situation over at the Middle East is getting out of hand and things may get even more uglier than it already did... We have to act sooner or later, otherwise our fate will be put on the wrong hands. If regular people like us band together, we have the opportunity to use this power for good where we voice our message for other people and the governments of this world to hear and hopefully consider implementing those necessary changes that could benefit us all.

Other than working just to survive, I have no love for the jobs I had as all we're really doing is to work until our bodies give in. That is not the life I desire, why must I waste my time slaving away to businesses that eat themselves up with money, putting their beloved customers up a pedestal while treating their employees like garbage when I can do something better like spending time with family, doing the hobbies I actually love with no money involved, having time to myself where I'm free to sleep, look after my mental health and just having the freedom to live my life without having jobs and money holding us back. It's dehumanizing, there's no humanity and empathy present in these workplaces thanks to the toxicity that a particular amount of sad pathetic excuses of human beings have used to taint these environments, getting away with bullying, discrimination, unprofessionalism, cruelty, etc. It's high school all over for me again and I'm forced to work with rude individuals who do everything to suck all my energy up to keep me in a vulnerable position for them to exploit.

No more. I can't go on working without having my trauma taking many critical hits, which I got my last job to thank for as I'd be in a toxic environment where gaslighting, betrayal, disappointment, injustice and the like would have a heavy presence that wouldn't be going away anytime soon. I've accepted the fact that I'll have to live with these medical conditions, the majority being incurable and even though I can make improvements with my mood, I'll never be that person where no pain and suffering would be suffocating me on a daily basis once upon a time. I thank those in my life who have given me these scars for me to bear, for that gives me more the reason to blame them to hell for being responsible in making me so unhinged.

And the cherry on top is it's all my fault that I'm mentally ill? Even though I've made many attempts to try keep positive, looking after myself, took many visits to the doctor, continued treating myself with love and devotion, the moment I lay my head down to embrace these spiraling emotions I have no control over, to feel these negative feelings that allows me to see the reality of these cruel moments I'm cursed to go through, I'm gaslighted to self-blame as I wasn't being strong enough, literally unable to be a full time superhero to please those around me. Apparently I'm a weakling for developing these conditions that were given to me from numerous shitty moments of my life. I'm emotionally abused by loved ones to feel utter fear, where I'm subjected to their control on doing things my body literally couldn't handle, like fulfill many expectations my family expects of me, ignoring my special needs, foolishly expecting me to get better, forcing me to get out of my comfort zone which does more bad than good. Screw those who tried putting all the blame on me, fuck them for their useless support which gets me nowhere and only further worsen my conditions. I no longer want to be a mindless sheep working for a society that has no love for me and does everything to break me in every chance they get. I want to be my own person and I want to free us from this unnecessary obligation that shouldn't dictate us to survive with money or die without it.

To no longer be kept hostage for the government to exploit us in working and allowing those who are homeless to die in the streets, leaving this whole homelessness situation unnoticed and nothing to be done in preventing lives to being lost. And those that die from homelessness are viewed by society as losers, trash, worthless, all because they have no money to back them up which would lead to their eventual death. I cannot believe humanity is allowing this, thanks to our ancestors from 7 millions ago (or even more than that) we've reached to the point where we basically have everything and are now living comfortably more than ever. However, we're still following a system that strips us away from our family and friends to waste time on jobs that drain us all to the bone and by the time it's the weekends, we're too tired to do as we please and would quickly return back to work to continue the 40 hour cycle. It's been brought up many times, but why must we be disposed of for not having anymore money when we can all live in peace and coexist in this lovely world. We all have the right to do just that.

A world where we don't have to work ourselves up for some measly amount of cash and with jobs being done by those willing to do it without been peer pressured, we can rid this ridiculous hierarchy involving the rich, middle class and poor once and for all. The pyramid that contains these three social classes will always be the talk of people's conversations, worshipping the filthy wealthy to making fun of the homeless, it's this social ranking structure that determines our worth is what fills my heart with absolute rage and disgust. This is another excuse to stereotype these groups that gets us to believe this is how we can truly live with ourselves. There's nothing cool about being rich when your wasting billions on a lot of stuff, with most you'd hardly ever use. At somepoint in our education journey, we would've came across the topic of being rich, dedicating our time and effort to reaching a class that'd free us from a lot of financial burdens and provide us freedom in choosing the things we desire spending on. The moment those successful enough attained this kind of wealth is what fuels their greed. Although this doesn't apply to everyone, humans are cruel in nature and it especially shows when our species dominates the many other species we coexist with on this earth. With so much money, you can get away with buying many properties, clothes, food, cars, iphones, coffee beans, when there are people out there in the world struggling to get by are far more deserving to having one each of these things than having only a certain crowd of people hogging all these resources.

  
Do you know money is often involved in crime? Ways criminals can do this is through theft, fraud, bribery, money laundering, tax evasion, etc. They don't care about you when your held at gunpoint in an alleyway, the crook determined to get money off of you forcibly or over your dead body. Crimes when it comes to money will continue rising as we speak, disgusting beings continuing their selfish pursuit while endangering the lives of others with little to no regard for the victims. Today's technology would be something these people use as a tool to getting money, especially with loads of scams having a huge presence in today's world more than ever. Cyber crime, ransom, viruses, human trafficking, those are just the very few examples of how these criminals would go out of their way in doing this kind of thing. A world I envision where money is now redundant, this great change would help decrease the crime rate significantly now that people with ill intentions don't have a reason to commit these awful things now that money is out of the picture. This is how we achieve equality with one another, no more labelling ourselves from a social class we belong in and comparing other classes, when now we would be fair and inclusive, demonstrating the true genuine humanity we all have within us.

Let's say our peaceful movement succeeds on our advocation and the government is onboard with this, how can we live in a society that no longer relies on money to survive and integral jobs are to be done by those voluntarily? Let's take a dive into this potential world scenario: the government would now be a council of those who are tasked to managing the resources we have in a responsible manner. Now that capitalism is out of the picture, the council gives us a choice on what we'd like out of the following; like what food, drink, clothing, tools, skin care, oddities, technology, etc. Once settling on each item, we wait for the next day to use our choices of what items we desire. And just like the previous day, we'll have one choice for each category and this is our way where patience is a key practice we'd need to do if we want to treat everyone fair and equal while managing the resources appropriately. We'll eventually get everything we want in a week, and the next week and the next, but most importantly, needs as something like eating food and drinking water is essential to our survival. Please don't complain that you can't get your 10th iPhone all on the same day when you already have one in your possession, why have 10 or more when one's just enough? Or it's ok that you don't have everything at the moment when it comes to having a shower and you only have shampoo when you'd have to wait to get conditioner the next day, just experiment on shampoo in the meantime and enjoy the process! Perhaps you'd like to make your own dishes at home but don't have enough ingredients, try focus eating small portions / snacks like bread, tuna, lettuce, noodles. etc.

There's no need for our bellies to be completely full when we can just be about 80% full or feeling like we are, so that we don't feel like exploding after digesting too much food which is unnecessary and again, water is what we need to focus on as our bodies are made up of a good amount of water, we can just drink the required amount each day and just drinking some of it not only makes us feel full but helps consume fewer calories in the process! Have a sensible amount of water for drinking which should be half a glass and make sure to keep that required amount. One or few is plenty, but going overboard on it til the point your stomach's full of water is not even advisable, your just wasting water at that point which you would be held accountable for. Our earth is pretty much covered with water so there's plenty for everyone, just have the few required amounts that's enough to keep us hydrated and we should be just fine.

I'm currently overseas but will eventually return back home at somepoint in November. As much as I love my holiday, I cannot stop overthinking of what the future is in store for us and trust me, it's not looking too good especially when briefly viewing latest news articles time to time. I want to do this, to make a difference in the world where actual change can come from our actions, depending if we all do this in a peaceful and professional manner when bringing awareness to the current issues plaguing our world. Because we're so obsessed in improving ourselves, I would like to use this drive to improve the world that I see fit. That's 10 times better than ""improving"" myself in a job that I'd passionately hate, getting no recognition for the work and just serving as a cog for this society which is something I don't see myself as.

  
I understand it may seem impossible to accomplish this extraordinary goal, especially when money is all digital and a huge part in our lives. But even money has it's flaws when it comes to inequality, corruption, materialism, inhumane practices, etc. I question myself in these made up scenarios, like if I have a family member that's gained life threatening injuries, the doctor won't be able to go through treating them since I might not have enough money to cover the costs. Or the government shouldn't depend on their money when making renovations on the roads when they can just go ahead doing just that. I mean maybe they need money to get the supplies that's crucial to their fixes, but why stress yourself over some financial stuff when you can go out of your way making changes for the society that's overdue on improvement. And with the doctor scenario, let's say I was a qualified doctor and I hear the bad news from this patient's loved one saying they don't have enough money to cover the costs, I would operate on that patient in a heartbeat as a human's life is more valuable than some plain money.

  
Please don't be afraid, we have the right to feel confident and empowerment within ourselves. Those who are against the idea of this advocation would want us to be in fear and distress, having us in their fingertips to manipulate. We must not yield to their dominance and speak our minds to eventually get the majority of the world's population onboard of this idea. That way, great change would start to take effect and although it may not happen today, tomorrow, in a week, a few months or even a couple of years, if we're determined to make this happen it'll definitely happen one day! 

  
Feel free to comment your thoughts on this written piece I've made, I would love to hear from you guys! You might just be like me, wanting nothing to do with money and not relying on jobs just to survive, or maybe you see that money still has a place in society and it could benefit the Universal Basic Income. Kudos to those that know of UBI and for those that don't, I highly recommend googling it as that's a concept that should already be implemented in my honest opinion! It'd just make things easier for us as that's what life should be like.",1,1729343822.0,antiwork,0,1.0,False

I've just moved from a big city back to my hometown (25k pop.) in a semi-rural area due to change of career/wanting to be closer to friends and family. Temporarily, I've moved in with my family while I find somewhere permanent. 

I've been focusing on Spareroom as I'm a single tenant and private renting is extortionate since I'm only slightly above minimum wage. Since I started looking about a month ago, I've messaged every single advert in my town (and within a 5 mile radius), 11 in total, and I've had 6 responses, 2 of which resulted in viewings. 

The other 5, bar 1, all show a response rate of ""good"" yet they've all ""read"" my message. I'm polite, friendly and have an active advert (which I link to!) but...crickets.

Hence I'm wondering, is my profile the problem? I live in quite a traditional area and I'm worried my profile puts them off? I'm keen for any feedback/criticism on how I can improve my success rate.

Minus personal info this is what I have on there:

""Hi,

Thanks for reading my advert!

I currently live in XXXXXX where l've been the last five years, and while my rent has been great value, I'm looking to be moving back to my home county of XXXXXXX to be closer to my family and friends,

Ideally, the flat will be fully furnished. I have my own
essentials, but I would prefer a place where there is already a bed, wardrobe, desk and drawers etc. For the kitchen while I understand it's unlikely - if that could be stockpiled with pans/plates/appliances, that would be excellent, but I can purchase if necessary

In terms of location, I'm looking for somewhere within an hour's walking distance of the XXXXXXX (my new employer), a bus route to the XXXXXXX or XXXXXXXX train station.

As for flatmates, I would prefer somebody friendly (l am fairly introverted and do like my own personal space) but not too boisterous. My own working hours are full time office-based, around 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.

Apologies, but I would prefer someone under 40 to live with since I do find it easier to connect with people around my age. Gender doesn't matter to me, as long as you're happy with a hot chocolate and watching a whole season of Picard or documentaries about world history, we'll get on!

As a side note, I am gay so I wouldn't mind living with
another person who is also queer but this isn't an essential as long as you are not a raging homophobe ü´†

I'm clean of course, and I would of course prefer you are the same.I do my dishes and pans as I cook and to save on stress, I'd be happy if we sorted a cleaning rota or hired a cleaner for communal areas

Just an FYl in regards to my budget, I could stretch to
¬£650pm each including bills if the flat is REALLY good but obviously lower is fine too. I'm saving for a house in 5-10 years hence my strict-ish budget

If you're after any other information, please feel free to contact me, and l'll answer any queries you may have

Thanks so much for reading! üòä""

I know the part about my sexuality probably jumps out, but I don't want to live somewhere where I couldn't in theory have a boyfriend over for coffee/dinner etc.

At 62, Tom was the kind of guy who always had a joke up his sleeve and a smile for everyone. He had spent years working as a mechanic, nurturing his passion for cars and spending weekends tinkering with his beloved classic Chevy. But as the years rolled on, Tom noticed some unwelcome changes creeping into his life.

For years, he‚Äôd prided himself on his health‚Äîjogging in the mornings and eating right. Yet, lately, he found himself making late-night trips to the bathroom, struggling with weak urine flow, and waking up feeling drained. It wasn‚Äôt just inconvenient; it was affecting his mood, his energy, and his cherished weekends with family. He began to feel like a shadow of the vibrant man he once was.

His son, Jake, a recent college graduate and aspiring health coach, noticed the change in his dad. ‚ÄúDad, you‚Äôve got to try something different. There are natural supplements out there that could help,‚Äù he suggested one evening over a game of cards. Tom chuckled, brushing it off. ‚ÄúSupplements? Come on, Jake. I‚Äôm fine. Just getting old.‚Äù

But as the weeks passed, Tom couldn‚Äôt ignore his discomfort. After a particularly frustrating night filled with interrupted sleep, he sat on the porch, sipping coffee and contemplating his situation. That‚Äôs when Jake joined him, laptop in hand, eager to help.

‚ÄúLook at this, Dad!‚Äù Jake exclaimed, scrolling through his findings. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called ProstaVive. It‚Äôs a dietary supplement designed specifically for prostate health. Lots of guys have been raving about it.‚Äù

Intrigued, Tom leaned in. The blog Jake was reading highlighted the unique blend of natural ingredients in ProstaVive‚ÄîBoron, Tongkat Ali, Ashwagandha, and more. Each ingredient was backed by research, targeting prostate health and urinary function, especially for men facing age-related issues. The stories of other men finding relief struck a chord with Tom.

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs worth a shot,‚Äù he said, half-heartedly, not wanting to admit he was hopeful.

After a quick order online, Tom received his first bottle of ProstaVive just days later. He was skeptical but committed to giving it a try. Mixing the powder with his morning smoothie became part of his routine. At first, he didn‚Äôt notice much difference, but he remembered the reviews Jake had shared: ‚ÄúConsistency is key,‚Äù they said. So, he stuck with it.

[ProstaVive](https://preview.redd.it/4awzfuvzhovd1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cbafc810492a0cb031b94a1a0042b57e6dcb7e6)

Weeks turned into a month, and Tom began to notice subtle changes. The nighttime trips to the bathroom decreased, and he no longer felt the urgency that had plagued him. The clarity of his mind returned, and he found himself laughing more often. His energy levels began to rise, reigniting the spark he thought he had lost.

One sunny Saturday morning, as Tom worked on his Chevy, he felt invigorated. He couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he had felt this good. His wife, Linda, came out with lemonade, eyeing him with a mix of curiosity and admiration. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your secret, Tom? You‚Äôre like a new man!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ProstaVive,‚Äù he replied, beaming. ‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs helped me with my prostate health. I feel like I‚Äôve got my groove back!‚Äù

As Tom shared his experience with his friends at the local car club, he became an unofficial ambassador for ProstaVive. One of his buddies, Frank, had been struggling with similar issues and expressed frustration about feeling sluggish. Tom encouraged him to give ProstaVive a try, citing its natural ingredients designed to reduce inflammation and improve overall well-being.

Frank was skeptical but, after seeing Tom‚Äôs transformation, decided to take the plunge. ‚ÄúIf it worked for you, maybe it can work for me,‚Äù he said, following Tom‚Äôs lead.

Months passed, and the community buzzed with discussions about prostate health. Tom‚Äôs story became one of many as more men embraced ProstaVive. Each success story created a ripple effect, empowering others to prioritize their health. Even Jake found satisfaction in knowing he had helped his dad regain his vitality.

Sitting on the porch one evening, Tom reflected on how far he had come. No longer did he dread the night or feel trapped by his body. He felt alive, vibrant, and ready for whatever adventures lay ahead. The simple act of taking a supplement had transformed not just his health but his entire outlook on life.

With ProstaVive, Tom had discovered that aging didn‚Äôt have to mean a decline in vitality. It was about embracing the journey, making informed choices, and leaning on the support of family and friends. And in that moment, he realized: sometimes, the biggest victories come from the smallest changes. **You‚Äôve got nothing to lose and, possibly, a better quality of life to gain:**¬†[https://prostavive.com/](https://freezegluco.com/ProstaVive.html)",1,1729343121.0,celebrityweightlose,0,1.0,False

I have read through all the other similar posts in this sub, and am sorry in advance to add another one to the growing pile.

My situation: 18F 6k HISA; 4k Raiz aggressive; 2.5k CMC Markets 70/30 VSG/VAS; 1k Rest high growth Super; 14k car. No debt, except HECs, no credit card.

I am studying full time (law&commerce-accounting), and will graduate 2028. I work in retail, earning **$300/week ish during uni semesters, $800 ish when on break**. Virtually no expenses (except my car rego and insurance, but I much prefer public transport so barely have to re fuel), I live at home and my parents are happy to look after groceries/bills until I finish uni (very lucky & grateful). While on uni break, I obviously contribute more to my accounts.

Currently saving **$120 a week into HISA, $50 a week into Raiz**. Both of these are no exceptions. I am doing **$500 a month into my ETFs**. Any leftover that I do not spend on coffee/socialising I put into a buffer savings account that I am allowed to take money out if needed. This account is my 'guilt free' account.

I am not saving for anything at the moment, it is more so to have a risk-free way of compounding my money. I started Raiz as soon as I turned 18. Only started CMC markets and moved some money out of savings into it. Not sure if I should keep them both or focus on one.

I have no interest in moving out of home for at least another 5 years. I have a great relationship with my parents, who would support me in anything I choose to do. However, to be clear, they will not fund my life.

No shame, I am a very material person. I really like nice things; jewellery, watches, clothes, bags, wine and dining. I want to be able to afford this lifestyle.

I have read the barefoot investor, but found that most of it was common sense and/or did not apply to me considering my lack of debt and any expenses. I have also read the Millionaire Next Door and really enjoyed it. Read through Lazy Koala Investing & am halfway through the passive investing website.

My questions:

1. Should I change my Savings/Raiz/CMC markets ratio?
2. Should I add a bit of crypto?
3. Any good book/website recommendations? Specifically no podcasts, I get so bored.
4. What are some good jobs for uni students? My current retail job is a casual position with varying hours and shift lengths, and its hard to dedicate time to study and hang out with friends with it so volatile.
5. Should I be putting money into my super? Specifically the $1000 contribution to get $500 back.
6. How much is a good amount to put aside for fun things, like travel etc. Or should I just keep everything in my HISA and dip into it when needed? This makes me uncomfortable as to get the 5.2% interest my balance needs to grow every month
7. Any general advice? How would you allocate your money if you were expense free?

*\*I know people will tell me not to worry about it so much, but genuinely I want to not just buy but afford designer bags. I want to be rich. That would make me happy. money* isn't *everything blah blah blah let me find out the hard way. I don't like getting drunk, will never gamble and don't do drugs/smoke. I do still have a social life despite this.*

*\*\* I also know I sound like a really fun person to be around. Please let me say shame free that being rich and financially independent ASAP is one of my motivators in life. I have time on my side to make good decisions and habits to set me up later on.*

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think¬†***the Moonwalk***¬†is just a fancy dance move, it‚Äôs actually an¬†***elite business strategy***.¬† One step forward, two steps back ‚Äì just like building a company!¬† You have to take a few risks, but if you‚Äôre slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.¬† In¬†***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to¬†**Moonwalk**¬†through your day ‚Äì from diaper duty to client meetings ‚Äì without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).¬†¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

1g789bv,https://i.redd.it/nyrasmgxmpvd1.jpeg,‚ÄúThe Lot‚Äù  ,"‚ÄúThe Lot‚Äù

In a world where the Purge had become an annual event, the rules of business changed, and no industry felt it more than car dealerships. Every year, for one night, society descended into chaos‚Äîno laws, no police, no protection. For 12 hours, anything could happen. Murder, theft, arson‚Äîeverything was fair game. In this dystopian world, protecting valuable assets became a matter of life or death. And for Fast Eddie‚Äôs Auto Emporium, those assets were a gleaming row of new and used cars.

Preparation

Eddie always had a haggard look as the Purge drew closer. His dealership, once an open lot with glass showrooms and inflatable tube men waving in the breeze, had transformed into a fortress. Gone were the bright lights and inviting spaces; instead, 12-foot-high walls surrounded the dealership, topped with barbed wire. Thick steel gates reinforced with massive concrete barriers sat at the only entrance. Eddie‚Äôs dealership was now less about selling cars and more about defending them.

But walls and gates weren‚Äôt enough. Not anymore.

‚ÄúWhere are we with the trucks?‚Äù Eddie barked at his manager, Sheila, pacing across the empty showroom. The cars were already hidden, but Eddie always needed confirmation.

‚ÄúWe moved the last of them into the underground bunker this morning,‚Äù Sheila said, flipping through a clipboard with meticulous checkmarks.

The Bunker. That was Eddie‚Äôs ace in the hole. Two years ago, after watching a rival dealership get obliterated by roving gangs during the Purge, Eddie invested in an underground parking facility beneath the lot. The hatch entrance was disguised as an ordinary utility shed in the back corner of the property, but it led to a vast underground labyrinth. Hundreds of cars, everything from luxury sedans to beat-up used models, sat hidden away beneath layers of reinforced concrete and steel doors, secured from any threat above.

‚ÄúThe security systems?‚Äù Eddie asked.

‚ÄúOnline. Full lockdown mode will activate at sundown. Motion sensors, electric fencing, automated drones‚Äîyou name it, we‚Äôve got it,‚Äù Sheila replied.

The drones had been a recent addition‚Äîsmall, flying sentinels equipped with cameras and high-pitched sirens to deter any intruders. It was just another sign of how dystopian the world had become. A car dealership, once a place of commerce and community, had morphed into a fortified bunker, ready for war.

The Night of the Purge

When the sirens wailed that evening, signaling the start of the Purge, Eddie‚Äôs heart pounded. From the control room in the basement of the dealership, he watched the streets around his property through a bank of security monitors. Sheila sat beside him, sipping a black coffee, her eyes glued to the screens.

Across the city, chaos erupted. Fires raged in the distance, and the sound of breaking glass and screaming was already filtering through the thick concrete walls of the dealership. But Eddie‚Äôs lot remained untouched‚Äîat least, for the moment.

At 9 PM, the first group showed up. A gang of looters, their faces masked, carrying weapons‚Äîmachetes, crowbars, and even guns. They prowled around the outside of the dealership, testing the perimeter like hungry wolves circling prey.

‚ÄúHere we go,‚Äù Sheila muttered, flipping the switch that activated the perimeter defenses.

The gang didn‚Äôt get far. The first few that tried to scale the fence were shocked by the electrified wire, knocked to the ground, twitching and screaming. One of them, in a fit of rage, threw a Molotov cocktail at the outer gate, but the flame fizzled uselessly against the reinforced steel.

Eddie watched it all, his stomach in knots. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll keep coming,‚Äù he said, voice tight.

‚ÄúLet them. We‚Äôre ready,‚Äù Sheila replied calmly, her fingers poised over the controls.

The drones buzzed to life, whirring through the air, flashing lights and emitting deafening sirens. The looters scattered, swearing and yelling as the drones pursued them down the street, broadcasting their retreat for all to see.

The Vault

Even with the drones, the automated turrets, and the electric fences, Eddie knew that if someone really wanted to break in, they‚Äôd find a way. That‚Äôs why he had the cars locked away underground. The bunker was the real prize.

At midnight, a new group arrived‚Äîbetter organized, more dangerous. They were professionals, not just thrill-seekers. Eddie recognized the insignia on their jackets‚Äîa gang known for raiding high-value targets during the Purge. They carried explosives, and their leader pointed toward the utility shed‚Äîthe disguised entrance to the bunker.

‚ÄúThey know,‚Äù Eddie whispered.

Sheila was already activating the bunker‚Äôs internal defenses. The door to the underground garage was reinforced, but if they breached it, all the cars would be gone.

The gang members approached cautiously, placing small charges around the shed. Eddie felt a sinking sensation in his stomach as the explosives detonated, sending the shed‚Äôs remains flying. The entrance to the bunker was exposed.

But as the gang moved in, a trap was sprung. High-powered water cannons burst from the ground, knocking them off their feet, followed by a barrage of rubber bullets from concealed turrets. The gang scattered, caught off guard by the level of defense Eddie had invested in.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not getting in tonight,‚Äù Sheila said, her voice as cold as steel.

Morning After

When the sun rose and the Purge ended, the dealership was still standing. Scorch marks marred the outer walls, and the remains of shattered drones littered the lot, but the cars were safe.

Eddie stepped out into the lot, surveying the damage. Sheila followed behind him, her clipboard in hand, already tallying the losses. They‚Äôd be cleaning up for weeks, but at least the inventory was intact. In this world, that was a win.

‚ÄúSame time next year?‚Äù Sheila asked dryly.

Eddie chuckled, though there was no humor in it. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs a next year.‚Äù

In this dystopian future, car dealerships were no longer places of flashy sales pitches and cheerful service. They were fortresses, their gleaming cars hidden in vaults underground, their owners hardened by years of lawlessness. Every year, they survived the Purge by preparing for war, knowing that in this world, only the strong and the smart would endure.",1,1729342434.0,SerendipitySaves,0,1.0,False

Some months ago, my husband and I were sitting together at a table for two in the center of the dining area. I had stood up to go to the ladies' room. An older man with gray hair and a full beard spoke to my husband and said, ""It's nice that you're taking your daughter shopping.""

I shot back, ""I'm his wife"" and walked away. He already knows this, yet every time he sees my husband and me, he continues making the ""taking your daughter shopping?"" comment and it's really annoying me. It happened again yesterday. As soon as he spoke the words,  I gave him a shocked expression but didn't say anything. My husband told him that I am his wife. He said he was joking. Husband said we don't find it amusing. 
Any advice going forward?

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

But I did changed my diet- cut off caffeine such as coffee and tea but switched to roobio caffeine tea, hot water with lemon and lots of herbal tea like chamomile tea so could it cause weight loss a bit? 
When I said I have upset stomach- it‚Äôs not painful or stabbing but it‚Äôs more like discomfort and feel nauseous.

Anyway, as an adult, my brain constantly feels fried. Is this a normal feeling amongst AuDHD folks?
I wake up, my brain feels like mush. I have my morning coffee and take my ADHD medication. Somewhere around 1.5-2 hours later, I feel fairly functional. This lasts for about 2 hours. Then I'm brain dead the rest of the day. (I had the same issue without the medication as well).
If I have enough down time / me time, I recharge some but otherwise I just want to sort of scream at the world to leave me alone and stop making me do things on everyone else's schedule.

One of the few times I've felt really ""okay"" was when I was doing a PhD and had a scholarship. The entire day was mine. I could schedule things how I wanted, I could work with my brain, rather than dragging it kicking and screaming through the day. I could take breaks when I needed etc. I didn't constantly have to juggle work and life in a way that feels constantly overwhelming. I was actually extremely productive, albeit in a chaotic sort of way, during that time. Notably, I just felt really very content.

Every since that ended, life has just been exhausting. I only work about 25 hours a week and I'm still mentally exhausted all the damn time. To the point that other people probably think I'm not too bright. Which is annoying because last time I did a real IQ test I was somewhere in the mid 130s. Not a super genius or anything, but definitely not dumb. But I just feel stupid all the time, because I'm constantly beating the dead horse that is my poor brain to do stuff, and it's hard to do anything at all when you're mentally exhausted.

Sometimes, it honestly feels like my brain is shrieking at me that it needs to rest, but I can't just stop working for an hour or so while it recharges.

The real struggle is that I don't see a way for this to get better. I'm in my 30s and all I can think about is when will I be able to stop and just be myself finally?

I've recently come to india with my family for tourism. Its my 2nd time here, first time was in new delhi and i enjoyed my time there ( i was a  young teen) currently im in my 20s (female and african) in hyderabad. 

So far the weather is lovely and so is the greenery, and I'm impressed by the driving here, I'd trust the drivers here with my soul, i thought my home country was chaotic but this is next level lool. Another thing I like is how fast you can get things done at hospitals. Which brings me to my rant, i dont mean any disrespect but just to understand how things work here, the culture and unspoken rules. Because im starting to feel very stupid üò≠

My mom wasnt feeling well so we went to a well known hospital, and ive noticed theres no concept of lines? I feel rude just bargaining into each counter, and i get ignored a lot of the times even if i say excuse me or get their attention initially. Even in the coffee shop, they'd take the orders whoever came after and when i try to speak I'd either be ignored or served later, (same thing in the pharmacy). Also the lack of gloves when taking blood samples, is it the norm? Even the dr appts are so rushed, randomly entered with no one calling your name in. It makes me stressed, I guess im pampered complaining about these things but it was starting to bother me, and its not in my nature to cut lines and tell the staff xyz while i can see they're still working. 

But i think ill have to start doing that, because i look so stupid just sitting or standing there waiting for my turn when turns dont exist üò≠ adult me and teenage me are having very different experiences lool, ofcourse it was different times cities etc. This treatment was also there in the airport. Someone told me they're being racist to us ( especially in hospitals because a lot of ppl from my country come here for treatment, and since they're uneducated are seen as beneath them) but again im not sure how true this is. Someone else told me they dont respect women which is why it keeps on happening üò≠ im not going to generalise because ecery country has its good and bad and the population here is huge! Kind of jealous cuz my country has a smaller population (ppl cant find partners ü§£ü§£)

We were friends at first but slowly feelings started to develop and we decided to try dating. At first everything was going fine, but I started to notice his strange behavior over time.
    
    For example, once when I was at his place, we were drinking coffee with his parents (yes he STILL lives with his parents) and I noticed that he was sitting at the table with his knees against his chest and holding them in his arms kinda like sitting in the fetal position. I get it that it's his house but personally I see that as being disrespectful. Like I would try to behave somewhat normally if I had guests over. Also he would just stare at me for no reason for a really long time. Secondly I noticed that he treated me like I was his mother. Wanted me to take care of him and console him and hug him and kiss him every single second when we were together. I had asked him that does he have a mommy kink but he denied it everytime I asked him about it. He also wanted me to dominate him in pretty much every situation which I didn't like at all. (There was alot more weird things that happend in the relationship).
    
    Slowly I started to think that maybe we should break up because our relationship wasn't really working anymore. I asked if we could meet up and talk. I told him that maybe it would be best for both of us if we broke up. He clearly has his own problems that he should discuss with a professional and I said that I myself have my own problems that I needed help with. He seemed to understand but asked if we could still keep in touch. I said maybe and then he asked for a last hug. When he was hugging me he said ""maybe in the future we can try again"". In my head I just went ""nope"" and left to go home. 
    
    Afetr the breakup he continued to send me messages every single day for 2 week when I told him to stop and that he should take time for himself and also to give me space. He didn't take that well and because of that I had to block him on everything. Some time passed and things were going well for me, until I saw him at my work place. At first I though he was there by accidet but later I learned that he was working there too. (EDIT: I had started working at that place after we broke up and he started working there after me). He knew that I was working there so why on earth would he come to the same place to work? For these few months I have had this weird feeling that I was being watched. I thought I was just paranoid but it was confirmed for me because one day I was going to the dressing room and when I came out I saw him at the end of the corridor behind a glass doors and as he saw me see him he quickly ran away. I didn't see him following me or hear him cause I had my headphones on. So now he knows where my dressing room is. 
    
    I'm honestly scared because idk what he might do and idk what I can do in this situation cause he hasn't actually ""done"" anything. Why would he come to work there anyway? Does someone have an advise on what I can do?",2,1729341101.0,ptsd,6,0.75,False

My family of 4 is looking to make a possible move to the Northeast. Husband and I grew up in D.C. but now have been in Charleston, SC for 6 years. Our families are located in D.C. but we don't want to move back there.

Things we are looking for:

* Budget: $700K
* Seasons and snow
* Close-ish to train or Amtrak to get to NYC or DC. Could be 20 or 30 mins to amtrak if needed
* Town that looks/feels like the original Hocus Pocus movie.
* I'm a stay at home mom, husband is fully remote worker so we can do what we want as long as it's in budget.
* Living somewhere where we can bike/ walk to shops or school. We love folk music, art, woodsy hippy stuff. We don't care about having sports teams or major musical acts.
* ""Good"" schools. This could be in the form of quality public schools (not really test score focused but kindness and creativity focused), Montessori, or Waldorf. Could do private but would depend on the $$.
* Quaker meeting house nearby would be awesome but not a MUST

What we love about our Charleston, SC suburb:

* -Friendly people
* -Quiet neighborhood
* -Lots of families with kids
* -Close to parks and nature (beach)
* -My son's public Montessori elementary school.

What we don't like:

* -I have to drive everywhere unless I want to walk on the side of a busy road but I can't actually walk to ""stuff"" like grocery or coffee or anything like that.
* -Not walkable to any cafes or shops. Pedestrian / bike safety is abysmal.
* -HOT. I mean it's almost November and I still had the A/C going yesterday. It does get cool (barely) but we miss season and snow. I get this totally a ""pick your poison"" type of situation with heat or cold. My husband loves hockey and skiing so I feel like we are really longing for outdoor winter sports. I think I will definitely need to visit a warm climate in March or so every year to avoid getting bad S.A.D.
* We are in a liberal-ish region but still.. it‚Äôs S.C.

I‚Äôm a woman of 33 and on antidepressants for 15 years (depression/anxiety/overwhelmd), but haven‚Äôt found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù yet, because of the side effects overshadowing the positive effects)

A few months ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and autism, so that explains my sensitivity to medication.I have a new very sweet psychiatrist who really listens to me and she suggested to try Duloxetine, but to start at a very low dose of 15mg. After 4 weeks I upped my dose to 22,5mg, but I still only feel the bad side effects and no improvement:

* I'm in a CONSTANT state of dissociation/brain fog, while I normally only have it when stressed or at busy places. I feel like a zombie!
* I have really bad moodswings and pms (never sufferd from pms before) and have fights with my family and friends and I am super emotional.
* I didn't leave my house for a month, while I normally am social and visit my parents a few times a week.

She told me that for my age it will take 3 to 4 weeks till I can feel the full effect of it.¬†BUT she also told me that Duloxetine only will start working decently at a dose of 30mg. So that‚Äôs the plan to up my dose very slowly to 30mg. I take Duloxetine for 6 weeks now, but I feel sooo bad and I am in doubt to push trough or to stop now. (I will talk about it with my psychiatrist off course, but wanted to hear your thoughts about it)

  
I am looking for some comforting words or people who maybe have a similar experience?  
  
Extra info:  
- since I upped my dose to 22,5mg, I also started taking Wellbutrin (Bupropion) for my ADHD. (I already took it in the past, so I know I can tolerate that.  
- I don‚Äôt drink alcohol or drink coffee, but I‚Äôm a smoker.  
- I am taking a pharmacogenetic test to see which meds suits me the most, but that will take 6 to 8 weeks till I have the results. So for now I‚Äôm a bit stuck.

It's crazy to think that I've been on this journey since June, and the results have been simply amazing. Now that I've lost more than 25% of my original weight, here are some amazing effects this lifestyle change has had on my life:

First, I've eliminated my brain fog completely. I can think clearer and more sharply than I remember ever being able to. I've also gotten way better at setting good habits (although maybe that has more to do with my newfound iron discipline).

I look completely different. I bought a computer a little while with one of those facial recognition camera features and a couple weeks ago, it stopped recognizing my face. I was both overjoyed and extremely annoyed since I had forgotten my password.

I've fixed almost all of my sleep problems. I sleep long and well and don't snore at all anyomore! I still have insomnia issues every now and again, but they're so infrequent that (as a result) I don't drink much coffee anymore.

I've gone from a size XXXL to an XL and now none of my pants fit. It's a bit of a wardrobe nuisance, but a welcome one honestly. I had a belt that didn't fit me at all at the start of this diet, and as of today I'm one belt hole away from it being too big for me.

I've mostly fixed my mood swings. I still get a little hangry at the end of my day fasts (lol), but I've got friends and family tell me I'm noticably a lot more even-tempered. Again, this may not be as a result of keto and more a result of my discipline but I felt it was good to mention.

Lastly, I would be remiss to talk about any benefits without giving y'all some actual numbers, so I'll attach my recent cholesterol results along with some other general stats. My blood pressure has been holding steady at around 110/76 with a pulse of 60 and my blood glucose levels stabilise to around 90-98. https://imgur.com/a/WYmUKu0

For those of you who are wondering what I've been doing, the long and short of it is that I've been sticking to 1600 calorie OMAD keto with less than 20g of total carbs and some day-long fasts mixed in when I feel like it. If y'all have any questions feel free to ask and I'll answer what I can. I have plenty of numbers on hand, but didn't wanna bloat this post any more than I already have.

All that said, with this update I'm 20 pounds from 222, my original goal. I'm pushing hard to reach it before December 3rd, as this would be the exact 6 month mark since I started on keto. It's funny now to think that this all started as a bit of a joke to me about 5 months ago and now I'm here, a whole 90 pounds down- a completely different person. I didn't talk too much about my depression and body image issues from before, (and I don't feel I'm ready yet to engage too much on it either yet, sorry) but I feel better today mentally than I have for a long time. I can honestly say that this diet, this lifestyle, the support system around me, and this subreddit have changed my life for the better. To those who have helped me get here, and continue to help others in this community, I am grateful. Happy ketoing y'all.

Here's my best attempt at a blurb for it:

Brayden Dosset is a man who loves his music, hunting, and creating what he calls¬†*exercises in fiction*. What most people would call flat out lies. He makes his living as an exceptionally gifted large predator exterminator, or¬†*Specialist*. He takes contract after contract, quietly proving, or creating the fiction that, he is the ultimate predator and without equal in his profession. A town in desperate need of his services asks him to track down and eliminate a mysterious predatory animal that has been plaguing the town of Fayden, Alaska for months. Killing a local Radio station operator first, before taking hikers and hunters and leaving little trace of the victims when it does. When he finally meets the responsible party, his world is irrevocably rewritten and he begins to understand his true place in mother nature‚Äôs food chain.

Here's a small snippet from the Prologue:

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  


Ed Rochester shook his keys out of the pocket of his blaze orange vest and looked toward the moon. It was going on full and hanging like an eye looking sleepily down at him from between some thin clouds. He put his hands in the small of his back and pressed there, leaning backward until he felt a satisfying crack and letting his breath out between his thin lips in a narrow shot of steam into the night air. The radio station always made his back hurt these days. It was cold. Even for this time of year. August, and he could see his breath. That didn‚Äôt bode well for the coming months. This would be a hard winter. It was 2019 so maybe everyone was right about all this climate change stuff.

	He took a step toward his Yamaha side by side, or as he called it, the Sonofabitch Car when it wouldn‚Äôt and so often didn‚Äôt start and began getting ready to head back down the mountain to his home in Fayden. Maybe he‚Äôd see if Tabitha‚Äôs was open late for a quick cup of coffee before he went all the way home.¬†

	He took two steps into the dark toward where the Sonofabitch Car was parked in the trees next to the station when he realized someone, or something, was standing just outside of the moonlight on the other side of the car.¬†

	Ed froze in his tracks. Something dropped inside of him. The air got colder. His eyes tried to focus on the shape. Was it a man? The figure seemed too slight. A woman or girl? Possibly, but his eyes seemed unable to focus on the outline enough to be sure. An animal then perhaps? The thing would be a shorter human certainly, but a very large animal if its shape held true. An animal seemed unlikely for many reasons though. Ed had been working at the Fayden radio station for nigh on twenty years now. He‚Äôd come out of his cave, as he called it, for nights beyond counting. Many of those nights he‚Äôd come outside to find a fox or even a wolf sniffing about his area. He‚Äôd even come out to see a full-grown grizzly more than a time or too. But whatever the creature he encountered was, it almost always lumbered off into the gloom of the night with little or no protest from him. Whatever this thing was different. It was not afraid. If anything, Ed sensed that it seemed to be regarding him with a sense of curiosity or even amusement. Something in the way it was standing.

	‚ÄúHey there,‚Äù Ed called into the dark. He‚Äôd wanted to sound strong and confident, but his voice betrayed him by coming off weak and timid. He cleared his throat and tried again. ‚ÄúHey there. Who‚Äôs that now?‚Äù Ed‚Äôs keys shook in his hands.

	The figure seemed to slouch some. Possibly leaning to one side as if shifting its weight on its feet. It was definitely a human shape. But his eyes betrayed him again, and the shape seemed to look more animalistic again. Ed took a step toward the radio tower‚Äôs door. He‚Äôd go back in his cave and call up Jack O‚ÄôTook or someone and see if they could come up with a rifle and flashing lights.¬†

	As soon as the plan had conjured itself in Ed‚Äôs mind, the thing moved back toward the trunk of the tree and in the space of no more than a second it disappeared in a cloud of pine needles. Soundlessly.

	Ed started for the Sonofabitch but halted staring at the trees. He had a sort of sixth sense premonition. Whatever the thing was, it was still there, and it wanted him in the car. It was toying with him. He could feel its amusement.

	He shook his head and tried not to actually dart for the vehicle. He pushed his key into the ignition, and nothing happened. His face fell and he tried again. The tree above him began to shift as if being blown by a breeze, but the air around Ed‚Äôs face was still. He tried again, the keys shaking in his trembling fingers. The Sonofabitch Car never started.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Feedback I'm looking for is mainly input on the consistency of plot and accuracy and believability of the characters and story.
