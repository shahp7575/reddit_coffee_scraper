Imagine typing a few sentences and watching a complete video appear ‚Äì visuals, narration, even background music. It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Google is pushing to make this a reality for more people with its latest offering, Vertex AI Media Studio. This isn't just about generating short, silent clips anymore. Google's aiming for a more complete production package, all driven by artificial intelligence and accessible through their cloud platform.

Think of it as a digital director's toolkit, but one where the primary input is text. You describe the scene, the mood, maybe even the camera movement, and the system pieces it together. It's a fascinating development, bringing sophisticated AI models for image creation, video synthesis, voice generation, and music composition under one roof. The idea is to let users, even those without technical video editing skills, create polished-looking content directly from their ideas. This could change how businesses create marketing materials, how educators build visual aids, or even how individuals share stories online.

# What Exactly is Vertex AI Media Studio?

At its heart, Vertex AI Media Studio is a collection of specialized AI tools integrated into Google Cloud's existing Vertex AI platform. It's not a standalone app you download; rather, it's a suite of capabilities designed to work together within Google's cloud environment. The main goal is to simplify the video creation process, taking it from a multi-stage, potentially complex workflow involving different software and skills, down to a more unified experience controlled mainly by text prompts.

Instead of needing separate software for image generation, video editing, voice recording, and music sourcing, Media Studio bundles Google's own AI models to handle each part. Users interact with these tools through the Vertex AI Studio interface, a web-based console where they can type prompts, adjust settings, and see the results generated by the AI. The promise is a more streamlined path from concept to finished video, particularly for those who find traditional video production methods intimidating or time-consuming.

# The AI Cast: Meet the Models Behind the Scenes

Vertex AI Media Studio relies on several key AI models, each specializing in a different aspect of video production. Let's break down the main players:

# Imagen 3: Crafting the Visual Starting Point

Everything often begins with an image. Imagen 3 is Google's model tasked with generating still pictures from your text descriptions. You might ask for ""a futuristic cityscape at sunset with flying cars"" or ""a cozy kitchen scene with steam rising from a coffee cup."" Imagen 3 interprets your words and creates a corresponding image. This visual serves as the foundation upon which the video will be built. The quality and relevance of this initial image are pretty central to getting a good final result.

# Veo 2: Bringing Still Images to Life

Once you have your starting image from Imagen 3 (or perhaps you upload your own), Veo 2 steps in. This is Google's video generation model. Its job is to take that static picture and animate it based on your instructions. This is where things get more dynamic. You can tell Veo 2 how you want the ""camera"" to move.

* **Camera Movements:** Specify things like a ""drone shot flying upwards,"" a ""slow pan from left to right,"" or a ""zooming in effect."" This adds cinematic flair that goes beyond a simple static image.
* **Duration & Frame Rate:** You can define how long the resulting video clip should be and set the frame rate (like 24 frames per second for a film look or 30/60 fps for smoother motion).
* **Object Removal:** Sometimes, the AI might generate something you don't want in the frame. Veo 2 includes a feature, similar in concept to the Magic Eraser found on Google Pixel phones, that allows you to select and attempt to remove unwanted objects or artifacts from the generated video. This offers a degree of post-generation control.

Veo 2 essentially tries to predict what the scene would look like if it were in motion, filling in the gaps between frames based on the initial image and your movement instructions.

# Chirp: Giving Your Video a Voice

A silent video often isn't enough. Chirp is Google's text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis model. You provide the script ‚Äì the narration or dialogue you want ‚Äì and Chirp generates an audio voiceover. You can typically choose from different voice styles, accents, or genders to match the tone of your video. This avoids the need for recording equipment or hiring voice actors for simpler projects, generating the spoken audio track directly from typed text. The goal is to produce natural-sounding speech that integrates well with the visuals.

# Lyria: Setting the Mood with Music

Finally, what's a video without a soundtrack? Lyria is the AI model responsible for generating background music. Developed by Google DeepMind in collaboration with YouTube, Lyria aims to create appropriate musical scores based on prompts or perhaps the overall mood of the video content. You might ask for ""upbeat electronic music"" or ""a calming ambient track."" Lyria composes an original piece of music to fit the request, completing the audio-visual package. This eliminates the need to search for royalty-free music libraries or commission custom scores for many use cases.

# How Does It Work? A Look Inside the Process

So, how does a user actually put all these pieces together using Vertex AI Media Studio? The process is designed to be relatively straightforward, centered around the Vertex AI Studio interface.

1. **Start with a Prompt:** You begin by describing what you want to create. This initial prompt might focus on the visual element first, feeding into Imagen 3 to generate a starting image.
2. **Generate the Image:** Imagen 3 produces an image based on your text. You might iterate here, refining the prompt until you get a visual you like.
3. **Animate the Image:** You then take this image and provide instructions for Veo 2. This includes specifying the desired camera motion, the length of the clip, and the frame rate. Veo 2 generates the video sequence.
4. **Refine the Video (Optional):** If needed, you can use the object removal feature in Veo 2 to clean up any unwanted elements in the generated video frames.
5. **Add Voiceover:** You type or paste the script for your narration into the interface. Using Chirp, you select voice characteristics and generate the audio track.
6. **Generate Music:** You provide prompts to Lyria describing the type of background music you need. Lyria composes and adds the music track.
7. **Combine and Preview:** The platform combines the generated video, voiceover, and music into a single file. You can preview the result directly within the Vertex AI Studio.

The key here is that all these steps happen within the same environment. You aren't exporting a file from one program, importing it into another, syncing audio, and then finding music separately. Media Studio aims to consolidate these stages, making the creation process feel more integrated, especially for users who aren't professional video editors.

# Who Is This For? Potential Users and Uses

While the technology is impressive, who is likely to use Vertex AI Media Studio, and for what? Several groups come to mind:

# Marketing and Advertising Teams

Creating short, eye-catching videos for social media ads, product showcases, or promotional campaigns can be resource-intensive. Media Studio offers a way to potentially generate variations of ads quickly, test different visual concepts derived from text prompts, or create simple animated explainers without a full production crew. Businesses could use it to produce on-brand video content more consistently and perhaps at a lower cost for certain types of projects.

# Content Creators and Social Media Managers

Individuals and teams managing social media channels need a constant stream of content. This tool could help generate short video snippets, animated quotes, or simple visual stories derived from blog posts or articles. It might lower the barrier to entry for producing video content, allowing creators to focus more on the message and less on the technical hurdles of editing software.

# Educational Purposes

Educators and instructional designers could use Media Studio to create simple animated visuals to explain concepts, illustrate historical events, or make learning materials more engaging. Generating a quick video showing a biological process or visualizing a mathematical idea could be easier than finding existing footage or creating animations from scratch.

# Internal Communications

Companies could use this for internal announcements, training videos, or presentations. Generating a quick video update with a voiceover and simple visuals might be faster and more engaging than sending a text-heavy email or creating slides.

# Creative Exploration and Prototyping

Even filmmakers or designers might use such tools for rapid prototyping. Need to visualize a tricky scene described in a script? Generating a quick AI version could help communicate the idea or test different visual approaches before committing to live-action filming or complex CGI. It could become a tool for storyboarding or pre-visualization.

# The Bigger Picture: Where Media Studio Fits

Vertex AI Media Studio isn't appearing in a vacuum. It's part of Google's broader strategy in the AI and cloud computing space.

* **Vertex AI Platform:** Media Studio is housed within Vertex AI, Google Cloud's platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models. This means it's primarily aimed at businesses and developers already using or considering Google Cloud services. It leverages the underlying infrastructure and integrates with other AI tools available on the platform.
* **Gemini Integration:** Vertex AI gives access to Google's powerful Gemini models, known for their ability to handle multiple types of data (text, images, audio, code). While Media Studio uses specific models like Imagen and Veo, the underlying capabilities likely benefit from the advancements driving Gemini, allowing for more complex interpretations of prompts and generation of varied outputs.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Google isn't alone in this race. Companies like OpenAI (with Sora), RunwayML, and Pika Labs are also developing sophisticated text-to-video generation tools. Each platform has its strengths and weaknesses, focusing on different aspects like realism, duration, control, or accessibility. Google's integration within its established Cloud platform offers a potential advantage for businesses already invested in their ecosystem.
* **Democratizing vs. Professional Tools:** While Media Studio aims to simplify video creation, it likely won't replace professional video editing software (like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro) for high-end, complex projects requiring nuanced control. Instead, it occupies a space catering to quicker productions, specific use cases, and users without deep editing expertise.

# Thinking Ahead: Possibilities and Questions

The arrival of tools like Vertex AI Media Studio opens up exciting possibilities but also brings important questions to the forefront.

# Streamlining Workflows

For certain tasks, the potential time and cost savings are undeniable. Generating multiple video variations for A/B testing marketing campaigns, creating quick explainers, or producing social media content could become significantly faster. This efficiency allows teams to focus resources elsewhere.

# Creative Potential

These tools could unlock new forms of creative expression. Artists and storytellers might find novel ways to use AI-generated video, blending it with traditional techniques or using it as a starting point for more elaborate projects. It lowers the technical barrier, potentially allowing more people to translate their ideas into visual motion.

# Quality, Control, and Limitations

How good are the results really? Early AI video often had artifacts, strange physics, or inconsistencies. While models like Veo 2 are improving, limitations likely remain, especially for longer or more complex sequences. The degree of fine-grained control a user has over the output (beyond initial prompts and basic parameters) is also a factor. Achieving a very specific artistic vision might still require traditional methods.

# Ethical Considerations and Authenticity

This is a big one. The ability to generate realistic-looking video from text raises concerns:

* **Misinformation:** Creating convincing fake videos (deepfakes) becomes easier, potentially fueling misinformation campaigns or scams.
* **Copyright and Originality:** Who owns the copyright to AI-generated content? What happens if the AI trains on copyrighted material without permission? These are complex legal and ethical areas.
* **Job Impacts:** Roles traditionally involved in certain types of video production (stock footage creation, simple animation, basic editing) might see shifts as AI tools become more capable.
* **Bias:** AI models can inherit biases present in their training data, potentially leading to skewed or stereotypical representations in generated content.

Google and other developers in this space emphasize responsible AI development, often including measures like watermarking outputs or implementing usage policies. However, the potential for misuse remains a critical ongoing discussion. Ensuring transparency and developing clear guidelines for the ethical use of these powerful tools will be necessary.

# Getting Started with Media Studio

For those interested in exploring these capabilities, access is provided through Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. It's integrated into the Vertex AI Studio console, the same place where users can experiment with Google's Gemini models and other AI tools. This suggests it's primarily positioned as a tool for Google Cloud customers, likely involving usage costs associated with the underlying AI model processing and cloud infrastructure. It‚Äôs not a free consumer app, but rather a component of a larger enterprise-focused platform.

Vertex AI Media Studio represents a significant step in making AI-driven video creation more accessible. By bundling models for image, video, voice, and music generation into a single workflow, Google is offering a potentially powerful tool for businesses and creators. While the technology continues to evolve and ethical questions need careful consideration, the ability to turn text prompts into complete video productions signals a fascinating shift in how digital content might be created in the near future.

1jvhtqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ouraring/comments/1jvhtqs/oura_ring_honest_take_from_a_cyclist/,Oura Ring - Honest Take from a Cyclist,"I've been using my Oura Ring for about two months now and wanted to share my thoughts so far for anyone researching or those of you with advice for my problems! For context, I'm 26 y/o male who lives a pretty active lifestyle. My primary exercise is road cycling, with some strength training mixed in.

My main motivation in getting the Oura was for sleep tracking, but I also wanted a fitness tracker that allowed me to still wear a regular watch. I've tried out Garmin, Whoop, and Apple Watches in the past. Here's my honest review:

The Good:

\- The sleep tracking is awesome. I had some concerns that I had sleep apnea due to a family history, and this allowed me to see metrics that put my mind at ease. I love checking out the sleep data each morning!

\- Battery life is excellent. I'm charging every 4-6 days.

\- User experience on the app is pretty good. Way better than Garmin, but not as good as Whoop - (the Whoop band always looked ridiculous to me)

\- The resilience metrics are really cool. I haven't gotten sick since I got the ring, but my wife's is pretty accurate for recognizing when she's getting sick.

 The Bad:

\- The ring scratches pretty easily. I even bought silicone covers to wear when weight lifting, but my silver ring looks very scratched after just two months. I'm just embracing it haha!

\- I don't understand how the tags are supposed to be insightful. I've tried to be diligent with entering activities and when I drink coffee but am yet to learn anything from it all. They just launched this AI chatbot thing which doesn't seem to be very helpful. I would be interested to hear other people's thoughts on this.

\- I don't think that it tracks stress accurately. I recently went through a week of having panic attacks off an on, but my ring would rarely label those times as stress. 

The Ugly:

\- Okay here we go... I would discourage anyone who is a cyclist from getting an Oura Ring. I am yet to find any reliable way to accurately capture my bike rides in my Oura Ring data. I have it linked to Strava, but it cannot import any heart rate data for the ride. Also, the heart rate dashboard won't even give me an activity label for my Strava ride even when it's been imported. The majority of times I ride, the ring isn't even able to capture my heart rate, it just says ""no data"" for the time I rode. I messaged support about this, and all they could recommend is that I wear gloves so that the ring doesn't move around as much. No luck. 

\- The step counting is completely all over the place. When I first got the ring, it seemed to give me a step ""equivalent"" for my bike rides. Lately, it gives me virtually no steps for my ride. Obviously, when you are riding a bike you aren't taking steps, but they have to be able to think of some way to make an equivalent. 

\- Overall, I just don't really trust the activity data. I think that the Oura Ring is best labeled as a ""wellness tracker"" and shouldn't be considered by people that are more interested in tracking activities. If that's you, consider the Whoop or Garmin. 

  
Conclusion: I like my Oura Ring for the insights it gives me regarding sleep. However, If I had known that it would be so unreliable in tracking my cycling I probably would have gone back to Garmin. Would love to hear about other people's experience!",1,1744235422.0,ouraring,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm open to voice chat as well, if we have good chemistry here.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeking:

A person who might carry an umbrella but isn‚Äôt afraid to say, ‚ÄúForget it, let‚Äôs enjoy the rain!‚Äù Someone who understands the difference between ""their"" and ""there."" Ideally, you live in the United States, speak English, and fall within the age range of 24 to 43.

You should feel equally at ease sipping coffee at a diner and dining at the finest restaurant in town‚Äîit's an essential quality in my eyes. Additionally, I‚Äôm looking for someone who loves to read and engage in book discussions, has a passion for music, and is open to exploring different genres (although I must confess, Heavy Metal and Bluegrass aren‚Äôt my favorites).

I hope to hear from you! Take care everyone!

I‚Äôm from Spain, and although I‚Äôve never really been into tea (I think I tried it once or twice a long time ago), I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time to give it another go. I thought I‚Äôd ask here since it seems like many of you are avid tea drinkers.

I‚Äôve always been more of a coffee person whether it's espresso, with milk, without milk, with sugar... I really enjoy coffee. I asked a friend who‚Äôs into tea, and he recommended an ""English breakfast tea"" with a little evaporated milk and one teaspoon of sugar to start. Does that sound like a good idea? Any other beginner-friendly suggestions to help me figure out if tea is something I might enjoy?

The teas I tried in the past were either a bit too strong or too acidic for my taste. After doing a bit of research, it seems like English breakfast tea is a solid option. It‚Äôs supposed to be a black tea, right? If I buy a box of tea marked simply as ""black tea"" at the store, will it be similar to that?

I have to admit, the sheer variety of teas out there is a bit overwhelming, and I feel like I‚Äôm a little lost in the world of tea! Any advice or recommendations are greatly appreciated.

1jvhq5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1jvhq5y/nesting_partner_doesnt_like_me_hosting/,Nesting Partner Doesn't Like Me Hosting,"So my spouse (34 M) and I (33 enby)  have been together for 10 years and married for 5. About 2.5 years ago we decided to be polyamorous, after a long and deep discussion on a conversation prompted by him. We decided we are non-hierarchal, and I have recently identified I am a relationship anarchist and lean more solo polyam.

Since then I have dated a few people and currently have one other partner I've been with for about 9 months. With that partner, my spouse and I have had to have some difficult conversations about them coming over.

For some context this partner lives almost two hours away, which for me being chronically ill especially is officially a long distance relationship. So visiting one another means having overnights is best for safety reasons. Me going over to his place (he is married) was fine with some discussion, heads up, and planning. They're fairly open, to the point where for his birthday, I was there along with his wife. She's great! I love their dynamic, but it's one that my spouse is not as open to. With my spouse, even having my partner come \*into\* the house was a major conversation that brought up a lot of anxiety for him. Eventually, after five months, my spouse said he wanted to meet him first and \*then\* see if he felt ok with it. They met, and got along, and now my partner can come over. But I am still ""not allowed"" (aka he has asked me not to for his comfort and I choose to respect that despite not agreeing) to hook up with my partner in any way in the house. Despite the fact that I have my own sleeping/hang out space in the basement. Even if my partner leaves the house, which he rarely ever does anyway. Until recently he hasn't been allowed to stay the night. Even that was sprung on me one morning over coffee during a random conversation that my spouse was suddenly ""open to it if he needed to crash"". It was something that frustrated my partner during the early stages of us dating, and I was anxious he wouldn't want to put up with my situation, but he was amazingly patient. There was a woman I was dating for a bit too and her having to meet my husband before coming over was intimidating and made her feel uneasy, so she never did and eventually the relationship ended for other reasons. Who knows, maybe that too...

My partner hasn't dated since we became polyamorous. We both deal with a lot of mental health struggles and has had a difficult few years, and he's a lot more introverted than me. We have also not been having sex due to ace-ness, which has been another issue between us. So I empathize and understand his hesitance in having to watch me date and be the one wrestling with feelings of jealousy and such. It can't be easy. But it's also really difficult for me because a) I dislike that being a rule but we share a house so I'm unsure how else to navigate that, b) hotels are expensive, and c) i am afraid it'll mean getting rejected because someone doesn't want to deal with his insecurity and the way it affects how I can navigate that part of relationships. And I don't think it's fair that I can't host. And the whole meeting him thing - if I want to watch movies with someone I'm just starting to date, having to meet my spouse. Also to clarify, he wants to mee them BEFORE they can stay over, like not just say ""hi I'm so and so"" right before we go watch a movie. He wants to meet somewhere \*outside\* the house - last time we did dinner. I get how that might be understandably intimidating for a new relationship.

I'm just looking for insight and advice. I feel like it's unfair, in a way? But then I feel guilty, like I'm not being understanding enough or empathetic enough about his situation. I just met someone else I like and they asked if I have people over at my place, and it brought up all this anxiety from dealing with things with my last partner. So I wanted to reach out for some insight and advice. Is there another way I should see this in order to be more understanding? Is there something I'm missing here?

feel icky saying ""well that's just what you have to deal with when you date me"" because I don't even AGREE with it. It's a begrudging compromise. I want to at least be able to hang out with people so the task of hosting isn't just on another person without it being a while ordeal. I don't even care about not being able to hook up as much (I'm acespec but sex positive and am ok with it sometimes).

So yeah... ramble over. Any thoughts? And thank you <3

P.S. Yes, if he dated, I would be ok with him bringing someone home to sleep with (one of the reasons he wanted to be polyam in the first place, because I'm acespec and not as into sex). I would just ask that I leave the house because I don't like hearing sex at all. Drove me nuts with roommates back in the day.",0,1744235156.0,polyamory,3,0.5,False

We had a brief meeting .  He asked me to come to his house for the weekend. He described it this way. We will go to the grocery store and get food.  During the weekend I was to cook and we would eat and have  sex.  I declined.  I suggested we could have a regular date, go to eat, go have coffee at a coffee shop on  game night, live music , Go for  a walk, maze, bowling, movies, etc.  Just see how it goes.  So he suggested getting a motel room.  I think it's not for me.

I met another man on the online dating. M52.. We met for  coffee. He seemed nice enough but I felt he was not interested in me.  I decided to move on and not waste my time  thinking  of him. But I was surprised.  He sent me a very friendly message on the dating site He asked me to meet him at his work after everyone else went home or his apartment or a hotel  for sex.
When we met I never picked  up that he had any interest in me.  I was the one who said time to leave.  I felt going to his office or the other places he mentioned was not going to work for me.

1jvhmjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jvhmjp/sf_the_hour_of_repose/,[SF] The Hour of Repose,"No matter how badly the day was going, Father Morrin appreciated the beauty of his church. Mrs Spencer, during one of her lengthy digressions on the state of the world, the Church and her own dissolute family, had claimed that it was one of the oldest Catholic churches in the north of England. Morrin had possessed neither the requisite expertise nor the necessary interest to debate the point with her, so had instead offered a bland smile of reassurance while his mind wandered along his list of tedious but necessary chores. 



His mood had not been improved by her usual insistence on bringing up his sainted and much-missed predecessor, since moved onwards and upwards to a higher diocesan calling, who had written a whole \*history\* of the parish. Morrin had never read it.



But when the building was quiet and emptied of its dwindling number of parishioners, Morrin could admit to himself that he was lucky in this sense, if no other. 



The Parish Church of St Thomas the Apostle stood awkwardly in the middle of a housing estate, where the white stone gleamed like a beacon. It had no tower, but its sheer height gave it presence. Inside, the ceiling soared; thick columns flanked the aisle; colourful stained glass watched over dark pews. The tall wooden doors dulled the outside world to a faint hush, though they let the cold in freely enough. The boiler rattled and clanked when it bothered to start.



Morrin quietly loved the building, far more than any of his previous churches. Nothing would ever surpass, in terms of sheer dreadfulness, the parish whose place of worship was a converted cinema. Skilfully converted admittedly, but whenever he walked down the aisle he had always had an unnerving sense of selling ice-cream. Or he remembered the university chaplaincy, when he had celebrated Mass every weekend in a cramped classroom, filled with optimistic young faces looking for answers he had never quite been able to provide. But at least the accommodation had been good: the chaplaincy was situated in a sizeable house, complete with a sprawling garden and swing. The students, coming for regular lunches of cheese toasties, always asked him why he called his car Emma.



A faint melancholy had settled on Morrin like a mist. In an attempt to shake it off, he turned to the business at hand. He was standing uncertainly in the narthex of his church, hand on the wooden doors he had just closed, late at night. Not because he had lost his mind ‚Äî although he sometimes wondered ‚Äî but through the demands of the liturgical calendar. Lent was reaching its climax; the frankly grim annual story of Holy Week was playing out. Betrayal, loss, pain and a lonely death. All ending, of course, in the joy of the Resurrection, but on evenings like this it was hard to look so far ahead.



Tonight was Maundy Thursday; Mass had been followed by watching at the altar of repose, commemorating Jesus‚Äô vigil, through the darkest of nights, in the Garden of Gethsemane. The Blessed Sacrament was exposed until midnight ‚Äî Morrin had tried to draw back the time to something more civilised and forgiving of his sleep schedule, but the older parishioners were aghast at the idea and he had beaten a hasty retreat ‚Äî so that the faithful could watch and pray.



And the faithful were conspicuous by their absence; the only ones who would have wanted to be there were far too old and infirm to be out at this ungodly ‚Äî Morrin inwardly winced at his choice of phrasing ‚Äî hour.



He studied his silent, empty church. Everything looked grey and cold, the stained glass windows dark against the night. All the lights were off, except for a handful in the narrow, low-ceilinged side-aisle that led to the Lady Altar, above which was the statue of the Virgin Mary, covered ‚Äî like all the others throughout Lent ‚Äî in purple cloth. On the altar itself burned the only four lit candles in the building, two on each side, their light flickering feebly. Between them, the golden monstrance, the appearance of which always made Morrin think of explosions rather than magnificence, holding the Blessed Sacrament.



‚ÄúCould you not watch one hour with me?‚Äù he muttered under his breath. ‚ÄúApparently not.‚Äù



Not that he had been too attentive himself. After sitting for the first hour ‚Äî the length of time more about tenacity than faith ‚Äî he had headed into the presbytery for a microwave supper, returning for the last thirty minutes so he could lock up afterwards. He was never too keen to leave the church open like this, especially after dark, but that night he had little theological choice.



Feeling the need to stop being irreverent and make more effort ‚Äî his mother‚Äôs voice in his head ‚Äî he set off to say more prayers. Stumbling on the edge of a kneeler unseen in the semi-darkness, and cursing under his breath, Morrin walked down the deserted side aisle towards the Lady Altar and the Blessed Sacrament with an air of quiet defeat. 



He kept his eyes fixed on the covered statue of the Virgin, bitterly aware that at the weekend he would have to remove all the purple cloths. He would have to drag out that wretched step-ladder again and hope nothing fell on him. He remembered a fellow priest once spent part of Good Friday in A&E after a large crucifix fell on him as he tried to return it to its usual place. They had all had a good chuckle at that, imagining newspaper headlines ‚Äî ‚ÄúJesus Kills Priest on Good Friday‚Äù ‚Äî and Morrin laughed softly to himself as he reached the front bench.



Guiltily, he tried to impose a bit of self-discipline. If he couldn‚Äôt concentrate on prayer, if he couldn‚Äôt feel, if he couldn‚Äôt summon up his faith on this of all nights, what kind of a priest was he? His mother‚Äôs voice again.



Even though he knew he was alone, Morrin still checked his watch furtively. Half an hour. His breviary was on the front pew where he had left it, and he was about to sit down when he noticed one of the candles had extinguished itself. He approached the altar and genuflected out of habit before pulling a taper from his pocket, which he lit from one of the other candles and used to re-ignite the absent flame.



‚ÄúIf only real life was so simple,‚Äù said a soft voice behind him. 



Startled, Morrin whirled around. Sitting against the wall in the front pew ‚Äî where he \*knew\* no-one had been a second before ‚Äî was a small, pale figure, hands clasped on his lap. Unremarkable clothes: a dark shirt with a white t-shirt visible at the neck, a dark green jacket, dark trousers.  A slightly shabby air. A high forehead, a lived-in, serious face with deep creases in the cheeks, but lines that maybe hinted at laughter? Bags below the eyes, but those eyes ‚Ä¶ not tired: glinting deep within his face.



He could have been anyone, he looked so unremarkable. A bank manager, a lawyer, a barista, a priest‚Ä¶ Except for those eyes, which blazed with a fierce certainty that belied the rest of him.



Morrin, unnerved by the Visitor‚Äôs sudden appearance, snapped, ‚ÄúWhere did you come from?‚Äù



The Visitor smiled wanly. ‚ÄúThe same place as everyone else?‚Äù



Before Morrin, his heartbeat beginning to return to normal, could ask what that meant, the Visitor added: ‚ÄúThrough the door, of course.‚Äù



Resisting the urge to argue, Morrin belatedly remembered his manners and apologised for his brusqueness. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt expecting anyone to be here.‚Äù



‚ÄúI came to watch. I didn‚Äôt expect to be the only one.‚Äù



Not too sure if that was an observation or an accusation, Morrin took the positive option: ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt get much of a congregation these days, unfortunately.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can hardly blame them at this time. Not a sensible hour for the elderly to venture out.‚Äù His voice was quiet and soft, almost amused.



‚ÄúThe choice wasn‚Äôt mine really. More of a tradition,‚Äù replied Morrin, helplessly aware of the defensiveness that had crept into his tone.



‚ÄúOne that no one follows anymore. A strange sort of tradition.‚Äù



Morrin was in no rush to fill the silence that followed. Instead, he stepped down from the altar and joined the Visitor at the other end of the front pew, sitting rather than kneeling and inadvertently neglecting to genuflect.



Gathering his thoughts and his breviary, Morrin tried to turn to higher matters but was too aware of the pale figure next to him. The Visitor looked straight ahead, apparently studying the Lady Altar. 



The voice remained quiet. ‚ÄúDo you find it hard, Father Morrin, staying awake this late? Or is it harder pretending to pray?‚Äù



Morrin hesitated, wondering how the Visitor knew his name. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a light sleeper at the best of times, so this is no hardship. Although the company is a little peculiar tonight.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd the prayer?‚Äù The eyes flicked towards him in the darkness.



Pushing aside the doubts, Morrin replied with confidence: ‚ÄúThere is no pretending. This is my calling.‚Äù



The Visitor did not reply, but something about his manner shifted. Morrin sensed the reaction rather than saw it. Amusement again, a satisfaction at a victory of some kind.



‚ÄúFunny how you avoid my questions, Father. I asked if you found it hard.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôve ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had worse evenings.‚Äù



‚ÄúI wonder how bad \*those \*must have been.‚Äù



Morrin did turn at that, but the Visitor was still staring at the Lady Altar. Not prayerfully, but thoughtfully, as if his mind were elsewhere.



Morrin hesitated, then launched into a little sermon. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like anything. It goes in phases. Some days it is as easy as breathing. Other days it needs a little more work. And it‚Äôs like a habit. Like ‚Ä¶ like checking your watch even when you know what time it is.‚Äù



The Visitor gave a slow nod, impressed somehow. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more honest than most.‚Äù



There was another silence, and again Morrin had no desire to fill it. Unbidden, a metaphor used by Father Byrne, his old teacher at the seminary, popped into his head.



‚ÄúYour Faith is like an old pocket watch,‚Äù Father Byrne had said, looking down the length of the pipe crammed into the side of his mouth. ‚ÄúYou must look after it, keep it working, and it will always be there for you when you need it, even if it is out of sight. Sometimes it might be a bit battered, sometimes it might need repairing. But it will always be there for you. As long as you look after it.‚Äù



Then the soft voice again. ‚ÄúBut what if the watch doesn‚Äôt work anymore?‚Äù



Morrin looked sharply at the Visitor, who continued to look thoughtfully ahead. He must have meant the watch Morrin had mentioned aloud, the one that is automatically checked. Yes, that‚Äôs what it was. Yet Morrin couldn‚Äôt shake the sensation that the Visitor had just heard his thoughts. And that was ridiculous. It was time to take some control of this strange situation. It was \*his\* church after all.



‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it supposed to belong to God?‚Äù came the soft voice, a trace of mockery around the edges. Again, it was like he had answered Morrin‚Äôs unspoken assertion. Did he mean that watch? Or was he \*really \*‚Ä¶ 



Enough of this nonsense. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but who are you exactly? I‚Äôve never seen you around the parish.‚Äù



‚ÄúIf you are this welcoming to all new parishioners, I‚Äôm sure your congregation is flourishing.‚Äù 



Morrin flinched slightly. ‚ÄúI- I just was wondering, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù



‚ÄúCuriosity and faith do not make comfortable companions, do they?‚Äù



‚ÄúNonsense!‚Äù



‚ÄúYou sound very certain. Beware of the man who is so sure.‚Äù



Morrin was transported once again to his youth, back to the seminary where old Father Byrne had frequently used that \*exact\* phrase. He stared at the Visitor. ‚ÄúDo I \*know\* you?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd recognise me if you did.‚Äù



Morrin was adamant he had never seen this man before. Unless he been at the seminary? He looked the right age, the right \*type\* somehow. Like one of the more serious, devout, austere figures he had known. But at the same time, not like them at all.



The Visitor asked, in a thoughtful tone: ‚ÄúWhatever happened to Father Byrne I wonder? Dead now, I suppose.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou knew him?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt would seem so.‚Äù



\*Are you reading my mind?\* Morrin thought to himself, almost daring the Visitor to answer. But the insanity of the idea left his mouth hanging open stupidly. He closed it, any remaining confidence evaporating fast. 



The Visitor sat contentedly, looking ahead, while the silence hung heavy. Morrin‚Äôs tone, when he spoke again, was deliberate, edged with caution.



‚ÄúDo you live nearby?‚Äù



 ‚ÄúClose enough.‚Äù



The answer was completely useless, so Morrin tried again. ‚ÄúAre you new to the area?‚Äù



‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say so.‚Äù A faint smile ghosted the Visitor‚Äôs mouth. 



Morrin looked back at the monstrance. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, after a moment, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome, of course. As is anyone else.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that is true, but thank you.‚Äù



Morrin folded his arms, the silence pressing again.



‚ÄúYou said this was your calling,‚Äù the Visitor said quietly. ‚ÄúIs it still?‚Äù



Something about the phrasing unsettled Morrin: the past tense, the questioning nature of \*still\*. He felt a pressing need to answer, to rebut what felt like an accusation, but the words would not quite come to his rescue. 



‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù Morrin said, with unnecessary firmness. ‚ÄúI gave my life to it.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd would you do it again?‚Äù



Morrin‚Äôs eyes flicked to the Visitor, still gazing at the Lady Altar with lazy eyes. The deafening silence was punctuated only by the faint sounds of traffic passing by in blissful ignorance.



‚ÄúI‚Äôve never thought of it in those terms,‚Äù he eventually replied.



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the Visitor. ‚ÄúNo. That much is clear.‚Äù



Morrin‚Äôs words still wouldn‚Äôt come. His mind groped for something firm, something rooted, but nothing presented itself. 



Still staring ahead, eyes gleaming in the candlelight, the Visitor vaguely gestured around him. ‚ÄúAnd this. Is \*this\* what you‚Äôve always wanted?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a beautiful building and‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúNot the building. Everything that goes with it. Mrs Spencer. The stepladder. Those hospital visits when they look at you with such \*hope\*.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow could you possibly know‚Ä¶‚Äù began Morrin, but stopped. Then, without his previous conviction. ‚ÄúI promised my life to Christ.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd what did he promise you in return?‚Äù



‚ÄúEternal life. That is what He offers to those who believe.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh dear,‚Äù said the Visitor softly, turning his head to look directly at Morrin, and then back to the Lady Altar. ‚ÄúYou \*are\* in trouble, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù



‚ÄúNow look here, whoever you are‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat do you \*really \*want? If you were free, what would you choose?‚Äù



Morrin began to rehearse an academic response involving human free will, and how God offered everyone a choice, but instead found himself thinking of Emma, whom he had not seen in almost thirty years, and remembering her ashen face when he told her of his decision. With an effort, he returned to the present and began a half-hearted reply, but the Visitor interrupted gently, almost wonderingly.



‚ÄúYou know, some people desire power or wealth or knowledge. Others dream of pleasure or freedom. But you don‚Äôt want those, do you? You want something far simpler. You want genuine certainty. Clarity. Faith. Release from ambiguity. You gave your life to a mystery that offers only silence. You want a reply.‚Äù



Morrin could think of nothing to say to that.



‚ÄúAnd you want a life that is your decision. None of this was chosen by you. It was an expectation. A habit. A \*fear\*.‚Äù



Morrin found himself remembering his domineering mother and her family, their control of his life. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scratch your head in church, God can see you.‚Äù The pressure of following the anointed path. The smooth charm of the priests who encouraged him to follow his Calling. And Emma, the sacrificial victim. Or maybe \*he\* had been the sacrifice.



The Visitor continued relentlessly but softly, staring straight ahead: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt real, any of it. You abandoned life. You sit here on Maundy Thursday, watching, waiting, listening for something. \*Anything\*. Revelation. Consolation. And what do you get from your loving God?‚Äù



‚ÄúI get \*you\*,‚Äù thought Morrin to himself.



‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not too late,‚Äù said the Visitor. ‚ÄúYou are looking for answers. You can still have them. You can still be a real person. Not a husk, a void where faith should be.‚Äù



Morring felt a flicker within himself. Maybe it was hope, but it didn‚Äôt quite feel like that. Not the hope of St Paul, anyway. Something about the Visitor‚Äôs words struck a deep chord; a resolution to the questions that had silently been plucking at him for most of his life. Was there more to life than empty churches, empty prayers and empty words?



He found himself thinking, inexplicably, of the opening to the Gospel of John.¬†\*In the beginning was the Word.\*¬†From the Greek¬†\*logos\*. A pretty phrase, if not especially helpful.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an odd choice, isn‚Äôt it,‚Äù said the Visitor. ‚ÄúThe Word. But elegant, in its way.‚Äù



Morrin spoke without thinking. ‚ÄúJohn had a poet‚Äôs soul, perhaps. But a theologian‚Äôs mind.‚Äù As the words left his mouth, he realised with a jolt that the Visitor had again heard his silent thought as loudly as if it had been spoken.



 ‚ÄúAnd anyway, it‚Äôs not really true is it?‚Äù



Morrin looked at him sharply but the Visitor continued to stare ahead unperturbed, speaking in the same gentle rhythm.



‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard a it put a little differently. \*In the beginning was the deed\*. I think that‚Äôs rather elegant myself.‚Äù



Another of those long silences, and then he continued. ‚ÄúYou sit here, waiting in the dark. For a word. But that‚Äôs not how anything begins. Not really. You want faith? Do something. For once in your life. \*Do\* something.‚Äù



Once again, Morrin found himself in the dusty corridors of his memory, remembering a favourite line of Father Byrne: ‚ÄúFaith is the art of holding on to what you once knew to be true, even after you've forgotten why you ever knew it.‚Äù



The Visitor laughed quietly in the darkness. ‚ÄúSeriously? Byrne was an old fraud, just like the rest of them.‚Äù



Morrin bristled. But for Byrne, he might not have made it to his ordination. Preparing to spring to the defence of his memory of the old man, Morrin failed to recognise ‚Äî or perhaps to care about ‚Äî his own resigned acceptance of this mysterious stranger‚Äôs ability to know his thoughts and memories. But before the argument had even formed in Morrin‚Äôs mind, the Visitor continued.



‚ÄúIt \*that\* all that is keeping you here? Memory of faith? Of a dead old man‚Äôs tired aphorisms?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, I can‚Äôt accept that. I can‚Äôt! I believe in ‚Ä¶ in ‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúTake your little piece of beauty from John. Your evangelist with a poet‚Äôs soul, a theologians mind ‚Ä¶ and a lawyer‚Äôs caution,‚Äù sneered the Visitor. ‚ÄùHe wasn‚Äôt writing faith. He was closing a case. \*T\*\*he Word was with God, and the Word was God\*\*.\*\* \*It‚Äôs not revelation. It‚Äôs an argument. The final word in a forgotten courtroom.‚Äù



Morrin said nothing because his words had deserted him. The candles on the altar guttered in a faint draught.



‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he said at last. ‚ÄúI know all that. I know the texts are human, that the Gospels aren‚Äôt a forensic record. I‚Äôve known that for years. That‚Äôs how he \*trained\* me. But‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs not the point.‚Äù



He could hear the stiffness in his voice, a note of pompous academia, and tried to steady it.



‚ÄúThe gospels may not be literal truth, but they speak of a deeper one. It‚Äôs not a ledger. It‚Äôs not proof. It‚Äôs more like ... like different painters trying to capture the same figure. The images aren‚Äôt identical, but they still point to something real, something \*true\*. Something worth believing in.‚Äù



He paused, suddenly aware how much space he was taking up in the silence, and how much he was revealing of himself. ‚ÄúAnd that,‚Äù he said, quieter now. ‚ÄúThat is what keeps my faith alight. Even if ‚Ä¶ even if the fuel is running low.‚Äù



The Visitor didn‚Äôt respond at once. He seemed to be watching the candles again; one had now blown out in that quiet breeze. ‚ÄúThat sounded like a defence,‚Äù he said eventually. ‚ÄúA position to be held. Not something lived. Words, not deeds.‚Äù



Morrin looked down at his hands. The fingers were clenched around the breviary, though he was no longer sure why.



‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt think,‚Äù the Visitor added, still soft, ‚Äúthat you really \*believe\* any of it. Not really, not anymore ‚Äî if you ever did at all. Maybe you remember the feeling of belief. But it‚Äôs just an echo, as empty as your church.‚Äù



Morrin tried. He really did. Desperately scrabbling around for something to assist him, a lifeline to escape from whatever this was. Lines Morrin had once found persuasive, half remembered from the seminary, now felt thin in his own mouth and the words still would not come. 



There was a long pause, in which neither man looked at the other. At last Morrin said, almost absently, ‚ÄúI still say the prayers.‚Äù He gave a faint shrug. ‚ÄúHabit, mostly. They‚Äôve become part of the furniture.‚Äù



The Visitor said nothing, watching as another candle silently extinguished.



Morrin gave a small, humourless smile. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a comfort in it. The shape of the words. The familiarity. It doesn‚Äôt feel like lying. Not exactly.‚Äù



Another pause. The silence felt different now.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt talk about this,‚Äù Morrin said quietly. ‚ÄúNot to anyone. It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter, most of the time. But sometimes I wonder when I just ‚Ä¶ stopped. Without noticing.‚Äù



Still no reply. The last two candles flickered, struggling to hold on in that calm, quiet breeze.



And that was when he realised, his faith was gone. It hadn‚Äôt been a sudden shattering, no road back from Damascus. Just a slow erosion, a wearing down of a certainty he hadn‚Äôt realised was so brittle. In fact it had never been certainty at all. Which maybe in some ways would have pleased Father Byrne. Or maybe not.



The Visitor turned to look at Morrin for the first time. ‚Äú‚ÄôYou can‚Äôt reason your way into heaven. But you can reason your way into despair.‚Äô Wasn‚Äôt that another one of his lines? You laughed the first time he said it, but it kept you from the brink on a few occasions, didn‚Äôt it?‚Äù



It was then that Morrin began to have doubts, not about his faith, but about his sanity. Was he going mad? Something about this man just seemed so unreal. Was he dreaming? The candles seemed dimmer somehow, and the sounds of the outside world had faded away to almost nothing. The rational part of his mind reassured him that of course it was quieter; it was almost midnight. But when he looked at his watch, the time still showed half past eleven. And that was impossible. Even the boiler had quietened, as if it too was watching and waiting.



‚ÄúI keep going,‚Äù Morrin said, with quiet desperation. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I know.‚Äù



A third candle gave up the struggle, its flame evaporating to nothing. Now just one final candle flickered feebly in the growing darkness.



‚ÄúYou still don‚Äôt quite see it, do you,‚Äù chuckled the Visitor. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even realise what you had given away, did you? Twenty, thirty years ago. To your mother, to Father Byrne, to your bishop. And for what?‚Äù



And now the Visitor leaned across, closer to the trembling priest, a gleam in his voice. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a man who sold everything for a pearl of great price, discovered it was nothing but a glass marble, and still told himself it was valuable.‚Äù



Morrin looked up at him. The Visitor‚Äôs eyes bore into him, glinting in the dark. The tired priest made one final effort, trying to summon up the strength to resist this quiet man. ‚ÄúNo. No,‚Äù shaking his head in a futile gesture. ‚ÄúAs our Lord said to Saint Thomas, ‚ÄòHappy are those who have not seen, and yet‚Ä¶ And yet‚Ä¶‚Äù



His voice tailed off, unable to finish the sentence.



Not unkindly, the Visitor said: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe though, do you? You used to ask him for signs. Even now, you‚Äôre hoping I‚Äôll vanish in a puff of smoke. You want a sign ‚Äî a word ‚Äî of ending, of finish. Of cataclysm. But that‚Äôs not how faith dies. That‚Äôs not how anything dies. It just stops being.‚Äù



The final candle extinguished itself, just as the soft breeze faded away.



Tears silently fell down Morrin‚Äôs cheek as he slowly shook his head before slumping on the prie-dieu in front of them. Forehead resting on his arms, shoulders heaving, Morrin whispered: ‚ÄúWho are you? Are you some demon sent to drive me from God?‚Äù



The Visitor rose, standing over Morrin‚Äôs slumped form. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly. If God isn‚Äôt real, then I‚Äôm certainly not.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo you know what did it? What broke me? Some kid in the hospital. No-one should have to go through what she did. What her parents endured. They asked me for answers and I ‚Ä¶ I had none. I couldn‚Äôt even lie. I just looked at them while they cried and called on God. But he wasn‚Äôt listening. And that‚Ä¶ all the arguments, all the theology. It just fell apart on that simple fact.‚Äù



He sighed, forehead resting on his arms. ‚ÄúWhy should we believe it? Because we‚Äôre told to by the Church? Or do we believe because we \*feel \*it? But that‚Äôs no different from those people who \*feel\* God in a Taylor Swift song, or \*know\* that he wants them to burn down that mosque. At that point, we might as well be the Evangelicals down the road who have stolen all my parishioners.‚Äù



The Visitor gave a slow smile. ‚ÄúBut they provide excellent coffees. And they have an amazing band. I‚Äôm sure the Lord would appreciate that sound system.‚Äù



Despite himself, Morrin laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love the money they get.‚Äù



The Visitor chuckled, a deep sound that reverberated. 



He placed a hand firmly on Morrin‚Äôs unresisting shoulder. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to worry anymore. This is your way out. This is your freedom. You have finally taken control and made your own choice.‚Äù



In the beginning was the deed.



And there they remained, watching as midnight arrived, the broken priest with the Visitor‚Äôs hand on his shoulder, like a bishop performing an ordination.



\*\*\*



When the handful of parishioners arrived for the Good Friday service the following afternoon, a few noticed how settled Father Morrin appeared. Calmer somehow, more confident. 



His sermon was, they all agreed, beautiful. Quite poetic, not at all like his usual hesitating academic tone. How he hovered around the idea of Peter‚Äôs failure to keep watch, and his denial of Christ on that darkest of nights. One particular line lingered: ‚ÄúThere are those who gave everything for Christ. But there are others who gave everything simply to be loved ‚Ä¶ and called it faith.‚Äù



And when the service had ended, and he shook Mrs Spencer‚Äôs hand outside, Morrin smiled at her warmly. Far more warmly than usual. But with just a glint of something in his eye.",2,1744234890.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

No history of anything other than severe anxiety and panic attacks. I have been in a stressful situation for the last 6 months in an abusive relationship and felt like my body started falling apart, most of these issues occurring in my mouth. About a month ago I ate a piece of cake and it felt like when you haven‚Äôt eaten in a long time and there are so many flavors it‚Äôs like overwhelming and my tongue started tingling intensely. Like a full on electric shock tingling. Nothing else happened. Since then, my tongue has been having a myriad of sensations from tingling and burning to just feeling weird and I have no idea why. I went and got tested for thrush and I am negative. The tip of my tongue looks inflamed and red with swollen tastebuds. I stop eating so many foods that I eat daily because I‚Äôm terrified I have some sort of allergy but no matter what I eliminate the tingling is always there. This happens with coffee, sugar, and flour mainly. Last night I made homemade sugar cookies with literally ONLY flour, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and baking powder. I ate 4 and thought finally, I can eat something good! I got up to get a 5th and after two bites my tongue BURNED like I had been scalded. I spit out the cookie and started to cry because it‚Äôs so confusing. How can I eat 4 cookies with no sensation, then have a reaction to one? Then this morning I ate toast and jelly with flour and sugar and no problem. This is ONLY my tongue. No rashes. No breathing issues. No swelling. The ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù is constant and I can‚Äôt describe it, it‚Äôs like I can just ‚Äúfeel‚Äù my tongue. The burning and tingling only happens on and off with random foods, and then I will eat the foods and it doesn‚Äôt happen again. Tongue tingled for two weeks drinking coffee, then stopped tingling yesterday. I have an allergist appointment May 28th, but I‚Äôm terrified something is going to send me into anaphylaxis before then. I cannot possibly do the elimination diet because this happens with EVERYTHING. Does this sound like allergies or is this possibly stress induced? ",1,1744234853.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1jvhi62,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1jvhi62/update_on_not_being_able_to_go_through_with_an/,Update on not being able to go through with an abortion.,"Hi again everyone.

Posted on here a couple weeks back and I received wonderful comments from all of you so thank you again so much for all of your support. Whenever I‚Äôve been struggling I‚Äôve gone back to my post to read over comments you guys have left to make me feel better and to reassure me that I am not doing anything wrong. So once again thank you. 

Thought that I would share an update with you regarding my situation. 

I have accepted the fact that I do indeed want to keep this baby. 

I had my 20wk scan the other day baby is growing well and is healthy, and it‚Äôs a boy. Although I do need to return next week for another scan as they couldn‚Äôt check everything was okay but from what they saw he was healthy. My boyfriend didn‚Äôt come with me as expected but my mom was desperate to come and was there with me too. I asked him prior to my scan whether he wanted to know the gender or not and he said he did and to call him afterwards, but I had to ask him again if he wanted to know, in which he again said yes. I told him that it was a boy and his response was just ""okay‚Ä¶‚Äú which admittedly it hurt, but it was nothing that I didn‚Äôt expect. 

I stayed at home with my mom that same night and went to see him and stay at his house the next day. We met up and went for a coffee and he wanted to get his feelings more out in the open as he feels as if I don‚Äôt understand and that he can‚Äôt keep going on pretending that he‚Äôs fine when he‚Äôs not. 

He started saying to me how he‚Äôs scared how I won‚Äôt go through with an abortion again and then he‚Äôs stuck having a kid, that his parents would also agree with him if they knew and would also tell me to have an abortion, and that we have no money and that the kid would have a terrible life growing up on benefits and that it‚Äôs an awful idea and life ruining to him. He went on to also say how it‚Äôs so unfair on men in this situation as they can‚Äôt do anything about it and are forced to support a child they never even wanted in the first place etc. 

What he said hurt, it made me emotional but I tried to stay strong and understanding. I‚Äôve made my midwife aware of my situation and his lack of support towards me or the baby and when I spoke to the abortion clinic again for advice on what to do the midwife was very concerned for my wellbeing and my safety so we agreed to book me in for an appointment at 11am tomorrow so that he thinks that it could be going ahead but I wanted the midwife to be there to help support me essentially because I won‚Äôt do it. 

Now he‚Äôs not coming with me tomorrow because he has appointments in the morning that he has to attend so I told him that I would go alone and I also realised today that I have a midwife appointment at 11:30 tomorrow anyway so I‚Äôve emailed the clinic to cancel and I‚Äôm going to my midwife instead for support and not telling him where I am going for now but I‚Äôm going to stay at home with my mom over the weekend until I feel stable enough to be around him again, even though I love spending time with him and I love and care for him so much. I am just trying to manage the situation as he‚Äôs making me feel so stupid and that keeping baby is not an option whatsoever. 

I have also reached out to get some counselling, recommended by my midwife and doctor, mainly due to my situation.

I am hoping that some space away from him for a few days could help and that I am able to talk to him more. 

Any more advice on my situation would be much appreciated. 

Thank you :)",10,1744234565.0,BabyBumps,6,0.81,False

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mushroom coffee is gaining traction as a trendy alternative to traditional coffee, but what are its real benefits and drawbacks? As we explore this phenomenon, you'll discover insights from health experts and enthusiasts alike who weigh in on whether this unique brew lives up to the hype. By combining ground mushrooms with regular coffee beans, advocates claim it offers a variety of health perks that regular coffee doesn‚Äôt. Let's dive into what makes mushroom coffee a potential game-changer for your morning routine.

### The Benefits of Mushroom Coffee

Fans of mushroom coffee often tout a variety of benefits that set it apart from regular coffee. Here are some of the most commonly mentioned advantages:

- **Enhanced Nutritional Value:** Mushroom coffee frequently includes varieties like lion's mane, chaga, and reishi. These mushrooms are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that can support overall health.
- **Improved Focus and Clarity:** With ingredients like lion's mane, known for its cognitive benefits, many users report better mental clarity and focus. This can be particularly appealing for those who need a productivity boost during their workday.
- **Reduced Anxiety and Stress:** Mushrooms like reishi are known for their adaptogenic properties, which may help your body manage stress more effectively. This can lead to a more relaxed state without the jitters often associated with regular coffee.
- **Less Caffeine Jitters:** Mushroom coffee typically contains less caffeine than regular coffee. This lower caffeine content can mean a smoother energy boost, helping you avoid the crash often felt after a strong cup of joe.
- **Anti-Inflammatory Properties:** Many mushrooms boast anti-inflammatory benefits, which can be helpful for long-term health. Regular consumption may support a healthier immune system and overall well-being.

### The Drawbacks of Mushroom Coffee

While the benefits sound enticing, it's crucial to consider some possible drawbacks. Here are some challenges that might arise when transitioning to mushroom coffee:

- **Potential Allergies:** Some individuals may have allergies or sensitivities to specific types of mushrooms. It's essential to choose your mushroom coffee carefully or consult with a healthcare professional if you're unsure.
- **Unfamiliar Taste:** The flavor profile of mushroom coffee can be an acquired taste. Depending on the type of mushrooms used, the drink might present earthy or nutty notes that not everyone enjoys.
- **Higher Cost:** Quality mushroom coffee could be pricier compared to traditional coffee. If you're on a budget, this might be a consideration when switching to this specialty brew.
- **Lack of Regulation:** The mushroom coffee market is less regulated compared to traditional coffee. As such, product quality can vary significantly between brands, making it crucial to choose trusted sources.
- **Research Still Emerging:** While some mushrooms have well-documented benefits, more research is needed to establish the overall health impact of mushroom coffee. Long-term studies evaluating its effects are still in progress.

### Expert Opinions

Health experts are divided when it comes to mushroom coffee. Some nutritionists appreciate the added nutrients and the potential benefits of adaptability. Others caution against the hype surrounding its advantages since scientific studies are still catching up. Nutritionist Anna Smith states, ‚ÄúWhile there are promising aspects of mushrooms in diet, individuals should maintain a balanced intake of various nutrients.‚Äù

Conversely, herbal practitioners frequently emphasize the power of nature and support the use of medicinal mushrooms, noting that they can be a valuable addition to a healthy diet when consumed intentionally.

### Can Mushroom Coffee Replace Your Regular Brew?

Integrating mushroom coffee into your daily routine can be a fun and beneficial experiment, especially if you are exploring healthier alternatives. However, it‚Äôs essential to listen to your body and see how it reacts to the change. You might find that it enhances your mornings or simply serves as an occasional alternative when you're bored of regular coffee. Whatever path you choose, remember that the ultimate goal is to find what works best for you while fueling your day efficiently.

The decision to switch to mushroom coffee depends largely on your personal preferences and health needs. If you‚Äôre curious, why not give it a try? You may discover a delightful new way to enjoy your mornings!

How Mushroom Coffee Compares to Traditional Coffee: Insights from Experts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mushroom coffee is gaining popularity as a unique alternative to traditional coffee. But how does it really compare? Experts weigh in on various aspects, including taste, health benefits, and overall performance.

### Taste Profile

One of the first things you might notice when switching to mushroom coffee is the taste. While traditional coffee has a bold and robust flavor, mushroom coffee brings a more earthy and subtle profile. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how they compare:

- **Traditional Coffee:** Rich, bold, and often bittersweet. Favored by those who enjoy a strong cup first thing in the morning.
- **Mushroom Coffee:** Earthy tones with hints of various mushrooms like lion's mane or chaga. Some brands may add flavors like cocoa or vanilla to enhance the taste.

Experts suggest that while die-hard coffee lovers may take some time to adjust, many find the earthy flavor refreshing after they make the switch.

### Caffeine Content

Both traditional coffee and mushroom coffee contain caffeine, although the levels can vary widely.

- **Traditional Coffee:** A standard cup contains approximately 80-120 mg of caffeine, depending on the brew method.
- **Mushroom Coffee:** Often contains significantly less caffeine‚Äîabout 30-80 mg per cup. This makes it a gentler option for those sensitive to caffeine.

Many experts agree that the lower caffeine content in mushroom coffee may lead to a more stable energy boost without the jitters that some experience with traditional coffee.

### Health Benefits

When it comes to health benefits, mushroom coffee has a few edge cases that traditional coffee may not offer. Here are some key points:

- **Antioxidant Properties:** Various mushrooms used in mushroom coffee, like reishi and chaga, are packed with antioxidants, aiding in inflammation and overall health.
- **Focus and Clarity:** Lion's mane mushroom is known for its potential cognitive benefits, possibly enhancing focus and memory.
- **Immune Support:** Ingredients like chaga can support a healthy immune system, giving mushroom coffee an additional health punch.

While traditional coffee does offer some health benefits, including improved metabolism and antioxidants, experts generally agree that mushroom coffee provides unique advantages geared towards holistic wellness.

### Energy Levels and Performance

Another point of comparison is how these two types of coffee affect your energy levels and overall performance.

- **Traditional Coffee:** Offers a quick spike in alertness due to its higher caffeine content. However, this can lead to an energy crash later in the day.
- **Mushroom Coffee:** Provides a more balanced energy boost, with many users reporting that it helps them feel energized without the subsequent crash.

Experts suggest that if you‚Äôre looking for sustained energy throughout the day, mushroom coffee may be the better option.

### Preparation and Brew Time

Both types of coffee are easy to prepare, but mushroom coffee can vary in how it‚Äôs made.

- **Traditional Coffee:** Can be brewed using various methods such as drip, French press, or espresso machines.
- **Mushroom Coffee:** Often comes in instant form, which can be mixed with hot water, or as ground coffee that can be brewed like traditional coffee.

The versatility in preparation makes mushroom coffee accessible for novices, while traditionalists might prefer the ritual that comes with brewing their morning cup.

Choosing between mushroom coffee and traditional coffee ultimately comes down to what you seek in your daily drink. Whether it's flavor, health benefits, or sustaining energy levels, you'll find that both unique beverages have something special to offer. By understanding their differences, you can pick the one that best aligns with your lifestyle and health goals.

### Conclusion

The conversation around mushroom coffee continues to gain momentum among health enthusiasts and weary coffee drinkers alike. Its potential benefits, including enhanced focus, improved immune support, and reduced jitters, position it as a compelling alternative to traditional coffee. For those looking for a unique twist to their morning routine, mushroom coffee delivers more than just a caffeine kick; it provides additional nutrients often overlooked in regular brews.

However, this alternative brew isn‚Äôt without its drawbacks. Some consumers may find the taste more earthy and less pleasing compared to their beloved cup of traditional coffee. Additionally, the lack of extensive scientific research raises questions about the long-term effects and efficacy of mushroom coffee. While it might not be for everyone, those seeking to explore new flavors and health benefits may find it worthwhile.

Experts agree that while mushroom coffee offers an intriguing option, it shouldn‚Äôt completely replace your regular coffee. Instead, it can be viewed as a supplemental drink that can be enjoyed alongside traditional coffee, allowing you to maximize health benefits without sacrificing familiarity. Whether you're a coffee enthusiast or just trying to improve your daily intake of nutrients, incorporating mushroom coffee into your diet could be an interesting and beneficial experiment.

Ultimately, the decision to embrace mushroom coffee hinges on personal taste and health goals. As always, consult with a healthcare professional if you‚Äôre uncertain about how this unique blend fits into your lifestyle. Trying new things can lead to delightful surprises, and who knows? This might just be the coffee hack you've been searching for.

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started!

The stones beneath Lord Valerius Volkov‚Äôs boots trembled. Not with the resonant thrum of dark magic he commanded, nor the synchronized footsteps of his once mighty but now tragically obliterated skeletal legions, but with the crude, percussive impact of a battering ram against his castle‚Äôs main gate. Each¬†*thump,*¬†each¬†*strike,*¬†an insult to his otherworldly. Each distant, flickering torch held by the mob below was a burning effrontery to the eternal night he represented.

From the crumbling parapet of his highest tower, Valerius surveyed the inevitable. Nocturne, his ancestral domain for seven miserable centuries, was turning against him. Below, the village of Oakhaven, usually a cowering collection of hovels good only for sustenance and the occasional thrall, was a swarm of furious fireflies. Unbridled rage towards Valerius festered amongst their ranks.

The usually passive and entirely unnoteworthy peasants, whipped into a frenzy of hate by a new hero. Not just spurred on by his accomplishments, his accolades, his do-goodery. They were led by¬†*him*. Sir Kaelen. The self-righteous, silver-plated boil on Valerius‚Äô unwashed buttocks.

Kaelen‚Äôs ridiculous ""Consecrated Blade"" had carved through Valerius‚Äôs elite guard like he often carved through the local ladies. His munitions of holy water -- a truly vulgar invention -- had reduced Valerius‚Äô battalions of zombies to steaming piles of bone and liquified flesh. Valerius clenched his fists, ancient rings digging into his unnaturally pale skin. His army was gone. His lieutenants were dust and whispers. Only this crumbling fortress remained, and the mob was at the door.

Desperation clawed at his throat, a sensation colder and sharper than the hunger. He, Valerius Volkov, Lord of Shadow and Scion of the First Blood, would¬†*not*¬†end his reign dragged into the mud by pitchfork-wielding peasants and a glorified tinsmith.

He turned from the parapet, his tattered velvet cloak swirling around him, and stalked back into the ritual chamber. Dust motes danced in the slivers of moonlight piercing the arrow slits, illuminating haphazard stacks of forbidden texts and esoteric paraphernalia. In the center of the floor, a complex circle drawn in blood, salt, and powdered bone pulsed with a faint, malevolent energy. It was a work of rushed artistry, flawed, perhaps, but born of absolute necessity.

""You leave me no choice, Kaelen,"" Valerius hissed, the words tasting like vinegar and piss in his mouth. ""You and your witless sheep demand oblivion? You shall have it.""

He raised his hands, ignoring the stinging protest of drained power in his limbs. He began the chant, syllables torn from a language dead before mortals learned to shape clay or wipe their asses. The air thickened, grew heavy, tasting of ozone and grave dirt. The lines of the circle glowed brighter, shifting from crimson to a violent violet. Power, raw and untamed, surged into the room ‚Äì far more than he‚Äôd anticipated, and tinged with something‚Ä¶¬†*wrong*. Unstable.

*‚ÄòXar‚Äôzoth, Chained Oblivion, He Who Devours Stars‚Ä¶ I offer thee a feast! These invaders! Their souls, their fear! Grant me vengeance! Grant me‚Ä¶‚Äô*

Suddenly the atmosphere changed, the air began to scream. Outside, the shouts of the mob and the thudding of the ram were drowned out by a rising, deafening shriek that seemed to come from the sky itself. Valerius staggered back, eyes wide, as the violet light of the circle flared blindingly white. The symbols warped. The energy buckled. He realized that something had gone wrong.

Was it his rushing to create the circle of power? Did he not use the right amount of bone to salt. He hadn‚Äôt had time to make the correct calculations. Kaelen had rushed him into this mess and he could only hope that it was enough, that through some miracle he had succeeded. Yet, as he watched the circles colors warp he knew a miracle would not come for him on this day.

He looked up, through a suddenly disintegrating ceiling, past the storm clouds Kaelen‚Äôs pet cleric had failed to conjure away. High, impossibly high, a new star blazed ‚Äì a malevolent pinprick expanding with terrifying speed. It wasn‚Äôt the cold, cosmic dread of Xar‚Äôzoth‚Äôs arrival. It was fire. Raw, physical,¬†*celestial*¬†fire.

""No,"" Valerius breathed, the single word swallowed by the roar. ""Well fuck, that‚Äôs not‚Ä¶""

He hadn‚Äôt summoned a god. He‚Äôd summoned‚Ä¶¬†*impact*.

The world ended not with a whisper, nor the satisfying crunch of divine retribution, but with the vulgar, incandescent fury of a mountain falling from the heavens. Valerius saw the horizon ignite, the very air catching fire. His castle, his world, his¬†*everything*¬†dissolved in a wave of impossible heat and force. He felt a sensation like being turned inside out, ripped apart atom by atom, yet simultaneously¬†*pulled*¬†‚Äì yanked sideways through a reality tearing like wet parchment.

Then, mercifully, blackness. Oblivion.

Oblivion, it turned out, smelled faintly of stale coffee, sugary syrup, and disinfectant.

Valerius coughed, the sound unnervingly loud in the sudden, oppressive silence. Cold, smooth tile pressed against his cheek. A relentless, humming drone filled the air, punctuated by the gentle¬†*thrum*¬†of unseen mechanisms. He blinked, his vision swimming. Gone was the comforting dark of his tower, the fiery end of Nocturne. Instead, harsh, unwavering white light assaulted his sensitive eyes from long tubes fixed to the ceiling.

He pushed himself up, his ancient bones protesting, his muscles feeling like sodden meat. His power‚Ä¶ it felt distant, muted, like a shouted echo down the long hallways of his previous abode.

I'm looking for a bit of feedback (and a sanity check) on my itinerary for an upcoming 7-day trip to your home country Bosnia. I'll be flying in and out of Sarajevo.

Most itineraries I've found online seem to rely a lot on renting a car, but that's not an option for me since I don‚Äôt have a driver's license.

I'm aiming for a balanced trip, focusing more on quality over cramming in as many places as possible. I know public transport in Bosnia isn't the most efficient, so I'm a bit limited in where I can go. I'd like to keep travel times manageable, while still getting to explore some interesting spots that are relatively easy to reach from the main cities.

Here's what I've put together:

## Time allocation

* Sarajevo: 4 nights
* Mostar: 3 nights


## Detailed(ish) plan:

* Tuesday: not a full day as I'll be arriving in Sarajevo in the evening, settle in and explore a bit of city and grab local food.

* Wednesday: explore Sarajevo

* Thursday: Day trip to either Jalce (see pliva waterfall and lake) using a coach bus (Centrotrans) or Travnik. which is a better option?

* Friday: Explore Sarajevo

* Saturday: Early trip to Mostar (train) - explore Mostar

* Sunday: explore Mostar

* Monday: Day trip to Blagaj (there are apparently two bus lines), I wanted to go to Kravica waterfalls as well but public transport options didn't sound reliable and don't want to risk of being stranded.

* Tuesday: Mostar to Sarajevo (train) then catch return flight in the evening.


## Interests 
Nature, food, coffee, history and religion.

## Questions

* Are the bus options mentioned above actually running and are reliable?
* I'm a muslim, how easy is it to navigate local food places when on a halal diet, especially in Sarajevo? do places put up halal signs? is meat generally halal or do I have to ask beforehand?
* I read that Bosnia is a cash country, does that mean cards are not accepted at all?


Please let me know your opinions on the above, any tips or recommendations of places.

Thank you.

In the vast desert between interstate exits stands a 1950s-style roadside diner with a flickering neon sign and a curious tendency to attract those who need it most. When vehicles mysteriously break down, technology fails, and roads seem to loop back on themselves, five strangers find themselves converging at The Last Stop Diner, where June Keller serves coffee with a side of unspoken wisdom.

There's Eli, a grief-stricken musician who hasn't opened his guitar case since his brother's overdose. Cassandra, a high-powered attorney whose perfect life has shattered into career rubble and divorce papers. Ray, a former trucker whose early-stage dementia has left him uncertain of where he is or how he arrived. And Tasha and Malik, an engaged couple whose relationship is fracturing under the weight of unspoken fears and diverging dreams.

None of them planned to stop. None expected to stay. And as days stretch into weeks, they discover that the diner creates not just delays but necessary pauses‚Äîspace for recognition before continuation.

Beneath June's watchful eye, transformations unfold: a song finally completed, a career redirected, a relationship recalibrated, dignity maintained through decline. The jukebox plays without coins, the desert blooms after storms, and June meticulously documents each visitor in leather-bound journals, continuing a three-generation tradition of bearing witness to the diner's peculiar magic.

But as vehicles are mysteriously repaired and departures become possible, each visitor must decide what to carry forward and what to leave behind. Because at The Last Stop Diner, no one leaves the same as they arrived, and being ""stuck"" might be exactly where they need to be.

A lyrical exploration of life's necessary detours, chosen family, and the unexpected healing found when we're forced to pause, The Last Stop Diner reminds us that sometimes getting lost is how we find our way.",1,1744233429.0,u_Luna_Publishing,0,1.0,False

These movies TO ME IN MY OPINION are such boring generic children movies, Sonic 1 was a really weak movie because of their decision of ""adapting"" sonic 1 for the mega drive, even tho it only references 1 zone from the game that only appears at the start the rest of the Sonic movie is not in the Sonic universe and I never understood why, Sonic universe has such a rich lore and worldbuilding and I'm talking about 2D Sonic games

Sonic 2 doesn't get much better, since they still in the real world, now it has tails and knuckles (I'll get on the topic of the characters), and a whole 20 minutes of human characters in a SONIC movie, and even tho it's an adaptation of Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 for mega drive, it still only references zones from sonic 1 in this case is labyrinth zone

Sonic 3 is almost there and but still a weak movie to me, even tho they're adapting a game that is set in the real world they don't go to the location that sa2 references, and the whole movie is so weak compared to sa2, my favorite scene from the game was the ending where the characters are reflecting about what just happened, and what they want to do, while sonic is reflecting about shadow, but in the movies Sonic and friends never question about what happened to shadow or what or who he was

The characters IN MY OPINION are bad adaptations of the characters too, starting with Sonic, he doesn't feel anymore a cool guy who loves adventure, he's just generic character from kids movie who is very fast, he doesn't have any characteristics of game sonic he's such a childish and dumb character

Tails and Knuckles I think they're are ok

But Eggman I don't really understand why they changed him so much, everyone knows that Eggman objective in the games is to conquer the world to create his own theme park, but in the movies he's just a bad guy that wants to take over the world, his robots are just generic robots they are all just white evil robots, no evil robot animals powered by small animals

And Shadow... I don't really like this version, because to me it's such a watered down version of the character, originally shadow was created to be the ultimate lifeform to cure his friend Maria that has to live in space because she's allergic to earth, in later games we have more lore about his past with black doom etc, but in the movie he's just an alien with his friend Maria

And the movies for some reason keeps teasing game fans with little subtle references, like in the first movie when sonic is in green hill there's a bit similar to green hill in generations, or dr stone coffee shop being named mean beans, or eggmans theme in sa2 being his ringtone

Got to know her through a mutual friend. She needed some guidance with a business and asked for some business plan expertise.  It came out over several conversations they are a poly couple.  Both practicing seeing others - been in the poly world for a while.  They have kids in low teens.  Specifically they allow ‚Äúpartners‚Äù into their home and mingle with their kids.

She has contemplated very serious actions and frankly was very open to me (made me uncomfortable).  I told her there are people who can help her and him professionally and for sake of her kids and family unit maybe it‚Äôs time to seek help.

She told me stories - and more stories on how she got exposed to poly - the poly rules that got broken - the exploits and boundaries that are/were overridden - and now she is feeling she made a huge mistake.

I‚Äôd appreciate your feedback, and sorry if it‚Äôs a bit long!","Today is Wednesday. Since Sunday morning, I decided I wouldn‚Äôt go to university. I convinced myself that staying home and studying would be more productive. But of course, that didn‚Äôt happen. I kept procrastinating, telling myself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start tomorrow.‚Äù And tomorrow never came. This pattern continued, and I distanced myself from my spiritual practices. I fell back into old habits like watching YouTube videos for hours, avoiding the real issues. I spent literally three days in bed‚Äîexhausted, drained, and defeated. The question is, why?

Let‚Äôs try to break this down and understand why this happened and how I can avoid it in the future.

‚∏ª

The Mistakes I Made & How I Can Improve

The first mistake I made was convincing myself that not going to university would allow me to study better and give me more time. It sounded like a good idea at the time. I relieved myself of the physical exhaustion of going to university and the mental strain of managing the little time left for studying. But what I forgot is that when I stay home, there‚Äôs no real external motivator like seeing my professors or interacting with other students. Even though the physical effort of going to university can be tiring, it provides an external push‚Äîa motivator to keep going.

I now realize that I should push myself to go to university, even if I‚Äôm not attending lectures. Just being there, surrounded by people and the energy of the environment, helps me. The same principle applies to anything related to procrastination. Whenever I feel the urge to procrastinate, I need to ignore it. Even if it seems like a reasonable excuse to delay something, I need to resist it. Sure, other people might handle procrastination differently, but I know that for me, delaying things only causes more mental distress.

I need a rule for myself: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt make decisions while I‚Äôm in bed or feeling overwhelmed.‚Äù

Another big issue was that I distanced myself from my religious practices. I stopped praying and fell back into old habits, thinking, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve messed up now, so I might as well keep going.‚Äù This mindset is rooted in the idea of ‚Äúall or nothing.‚Äù But I now understand that just because I‚Äôve missed one thing doesn‚Äôt mean everything else needs to fall apart. Even if I feel far from my faith, I need to keep showing up‚Äî‚Äúprayer isn‚Äôt about being perfect; it‚Äôs about coming back to God.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Dealing with the Morning Struggles

Mornings are tough for me. The first thing I do when I wake up usually sets the tone for the rest of the day. So, I‚Äôve started setting some rules: ‚ÄúAs soon as my alarm rings, I get up.‚Äù I don‚Äôt give myself time to think or snooze. Even if I wake up early, I don‚Äôt go back to sleep because I know it won‚Äôt be restful.

The first 30 minutes of the day are crucial, so I‚Äôve decided to:
	‚Ä¢	Avoid my phone.
	‚Ä¢	Recite some Quran, even for just a few minutes.
	‚Ä¢	Stand up and drink my tea or coffee while walking or stretching.

‚∏ª

How I Plan to Change My Habits

Instead of wasting time watching YouTube or other distractions, I plan to use that time more productively. One idea I‚Äôm implementing is to listen to Quran recitations or read a few verses in the morning.

I wanted to share this experience because I think many of us with ADHD struggle with procrastination, impulsivity, and maintaining routines.

1jvgvnh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jvgvnh,25 for 25 group tally,"Newish to posting on reddit, newish to the podcast (first Tracy Letts episode), very new to the subreddit, and I was curious about its collective taste. So I did a very rough tally of all the list I could find (both in NightsOfFellini's initial megathread and individual submissions, minus 2 spotted gag lists and a couple people that I noticed submitted multiple times), with as little editorializing as possible (examples of it happening: someone submitting an unranked list with 26 entries, so I just deleted the last title; someone voting for The Lord of the Rings trilogy or without specifying basically did not count toward anything; TV shows/episodes I recognized would have been deleted, but I don't think any were contention). I only tallied lists submitted before 2:00pm eastern.

The count: no 1 = 25 pts., no 25 = 1 pt, with decreasing incrementally in between. Movies in unranked lists were worth 0 points. Then every entry had a weighted bonus of 10 pts. So every individual movie submission was ascribed a value as high as 35 and as low as 10. Letterboxd lists, unless they were very obviously in chronological order, were counted as if they were ranked in preferential order, whether the setting was switched on or not.

The process: I copy and pasted lists or transcribed them from letterboxd photos, assigned numbers, sorted, tried to find all the oddly-entered titles (if you used an unconventional format, or I couldn't read your jpg, it's likely I missed something), transposed the tally cells, deleted duplicate entries, sorted by number votes received, sum functioned every row, and finally sorted based on the sum.

Total lists: **101**. Total votes: **2452**. Total movies: **687**. Most votes for a single movie: **47** (No Country)

1jvgusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaestriHouse/comments/1jvgusk/maestri_house_lunafro_art_review/,Maestri House Lunafro Art - Review,"I was selected as one of the beta testers for the Lunafro milk frother. I received the product a few weeks ago on March 24th and I've used it for lattes and to make cold foam to add to iced coffee drinks (typically an Iced Americano).

The Lunafro is definitely capable of producing very fine microfoam to create a silky smooth milk texture which is needed for nice latte art as well as having a good tactile experience while drinking a latte in my opinion.

When I started using it I was able to create a reasonable milk texture that could pour some more forgiving latte art designs. The product is intuitive enough that early use can get you in the ballpark or near where you need to go with texturing. My first few uses did produce some more visible bubbles in the milk than what I would get with a steam wand, and the foam was thicker than I wanted it to be. But I was pretty happy that I could get the results I did out of the box with zero experience using a hand frother in the past.

[My first latte made with the Lunafro](https://imgur.com/gallery/maestri-house-lunafro-attempt-1-uN9eh8K)

Once I got a bit more practice in I was able to learn a few tricks to make texturing the milk easier and I was able to get the very fine microfoam I was looking for. I switched to a smaller pitcher which was able to be filled up more with milk relative to its size compared to the larger pitcher I was using at first. I aerate the milk for 4-6 seconds at a somewhat low power state in the middle of pitcher. After that I submerge the frother deeper into the milk, move it to the top left quadrant (position 1 according to the [getting started video](https://www.reddit.com/r/latteart/comments/1j7uu4g/practice_latte_art_with_soap_lunafroart_frothing/) posted on this subreddit), and increased its speed until I get a good vortex. Its important to not increase the speed too much too fast because you want to be able to control the vortex and not accidentally start adding more air to the milk or blowing the milk out of the pitcher. I'll hold this until the milk looks nice and shiny, typically around 30 seconds. Once that's done I tap the pitcher to settle the foam and knock out any bubbles, then I swirl it to make sure the foam is evenly integrated in the milk. Then I pour the latte art.

[A more recent latte with the Lunafro](https://imgur.com/gallery/maestri-house-lunafro-art-qIL5EDc)

To make cold foam, I either use cold milk or if I want a flavored cold foam I add syrup + cold milk to a pitcher together. From there its the same technique as what I use for a hot latte but I increase the aeration period significantly (until there is a noticeable increase in volume). I also integrate the foam for a longer period of time to ensure its stable when poured into a drink.

[An iced Americano with vanilla cold foam](https://imgur.com/a/HdBVvla)

As a side note, what's worked out for me to heat the milk up is to use a glass measuring cup to heat up the milk. For my microwave its about 2 minutes at 70% power to get to around 130F/55C. I use hot water to preheat my milk pitcher to ensure there's minimal heat loss from transferring the milk into the pitcher.

Overall, I'm very happy with the Lunafro. It can make incredibly textured milk, and it took me way less time to learn how to properly use it than it took me to learn how to properly steam milk on a traditional steam wand. The ability to make cold foam means it will see a lot of use from me, especially during summer since I'll mostly be drinking iced coffee drinks then. And it makes me want to get a portable espresso maker so I can use it to make delicious lattes while traveling.",1,1744232908.0,MaestriHouse,1,1.0,False

Why are you more yourself when people are hooked?

Say someone wants to be a butcher. They go and butcher animals, entering a market of people that end the lives of a lot of animals. It's already a spot that's good for some and bad for others, and I suppose you can be the efficient butcher where an inefficient butcher that causes suffering to the animals would have been in your place otherwise. I see YouTube in a lot of the same ways, where it's already starting at a net deficit but it could climb into a positive with enough careful consideration and execution. 

They're shilling products, or they're living off of patronage. Some of them get lucky and they have a thriving community of likeminded kind people that patron, but most of them are just serving as cogs in an advertising matrix that's nearly impossible to escape. It's there to suck as much time out of people's days as possible, algorithmically fine tuned to make people ignore everything that isn't currently on the screen. How isn't that basically like being a drug dealer? They're all supposed to get addicted. 

Some people are good drug dealers, they sell medicine that people need and tell their clients exactly what their product is and what it does. It's not inherently bad to be a drug dealer, but there's a lot of ways to be a bad drug dealer. How do you make it more good than it's already worse? I mean, let's face it, each of these clients are addicted enough that if you stopped selling they'd just go to someone else. If we stop posting then someone else will fill in the gap, maybe even try to copy your product to fill the niche. 

So, we're social media influencers. We influence people to think in certain ways, to decide upon certain things, and most of us are addicts ourselves. ""Spend your time playing this game with my code so I can play videogames all day and talk about videogames all day."" is the message sometimes, the influence, and it all snowballs into the next influencer. It's really made to feel like The American Dream that you can sit at your computer and make money from playing videogames, streaming for attention. 

But it doesn't end at that, we all know that. It ends in someone spending way too much time and money, ruining their life, and having nothing to show for it all. Freemium games and algorithm cycles looping infinitely in a feedback cycle of ""I must entertain so I can stay entertained."" that one day crashes into a burnout. People keep posting daily to their channels that haven't had more than 500 subs in the past 5 years, just like victims of a Multi Level Marketing scheme to sell kitchen knives for tiered rewards. 

People are having lunch alone, watching people talk at them as though it's talking to them. Dissociating from their depressing lives left and right with a substance that's considered more casual than coffee. It's so casual it's not even considered a substance, substance itself is too controversial to fit. Placebo effects can make saline operate like morphine, so why not have pixels on a screen operate like a needle in the arm would? Influencers get people hooked, but if they're lucky they'll hook people on good medicine.

From here I don't know what good medicine is anymore. It's such a guessing game, and often it's so bitter that it needs sugar to go down. We're just spewing all of these answers out at people like it's an all encompassing solution, but the only thing I can think of that I'd reccommend everybody is drinking enough clean water. How much sugar does it need? When does it become so much sugar that it's just another addictive substance? It's really hard to say.

I'm still cured from my original CUTI that I fought for a year, but I'm struggling being able to return to sex (still) and any water based activities.

I'm an avid fisherwoman at the beach.

So far for 2024 and 2025 I've only gotten a lower tract UTI twice.

First time was swimming in the pool.

Second time was this Friday... I was working hard on the beach for my children's fishing business and had back-to-back families for 4 hours.

I drank 1 cup of coffee that morning, had a BIG water on me, and seemed to hydrate... but it seemed after 4 hours of fishing & working (it's a lot of hard work), the next night I developed a UTI and took the Augmentin I had on hand. Of course, when I came back home from the beach, I peed while showering and cleaned myself up really good. I live like a 2 min drive from the beach, so it's not like I'm waiting around in wet clothes for a long time. I also do not wear bikini bottoms or any tight bathing suit bottoms that I know would create any issues. I always wear shorts at the beach.

Not surprisingly, my Cirrus test came back positive for moderate e. coli.

What was kind of surprising is that it showed Augmentin as being resistant, and I have just finished 3 days of Augmentin and so far (knock on wood) I feel pretty much 99% better? I was also taking LARGE scoops of D-Mannose after I got sick, and I'm thinking maybe the D-Mannose worked really well on the e. coli. Hopefully.

Dr Heer told me to hold off on starting macrobid and just keep on with the D-mannose with a biofilm disruptor and vitamin D.

It's just kind of frustrating that I haven't been able to return to sex because I've been dealing with figuring out why I'm getting UTIs when it comes to being in or around the pool or water/beach now.

What's interesting is that I don't seem to have any UTI problems when I'm fishing by myself. I pee in the ocean. I've never had any UTIs in a year of fishing on the beach.

But on Friday when I peed in the ocean (I was a nervous pee-er because I was in front of families LOL), something just didn't feel quite right with me internally. I squatted in the surf with shallow water and sand. I have no clue if the e. coli is coming from within myself or if it's external from the environment. Like in the ocean water.

Or I don't know if it's somehow coming from within me. I know when I'm nervous peeing at the beach sometimes it feels like the urine goes shooting back inside of me if I'm nervous and doesn't come out as easily.

I talk to Dr Heer again soon, so any tips or things to talk about with him next chat with him would be really helpful.

Thaaaaaanks. C:

(Wanted to note there has been really minor progress in my UTI health. Having Dr Heer as a doc has been a real life saver because with him, he prescribes me antibiotics to take RIGHT AWAY when I feel an infection hit. And because of that, both the infections I got recently were pretty tame and easily handled compared to having to wait, let things get worse, and turn into a kidney infection. I'm hoping the next time I attempt intercourse that I will take Augmentin THAT DAY instead of waiting until after having sex. I want to believe there is a way for this to get better for me and not giving up.)",1,1744232599.0,CUTI,0,1.0,False

When i checked back later the cloudy stuff was back, so I filtered again and it was crystal clear, but today it's back again. Since it was clear after filtering it tells me that whatever it is, it's coming from the solution.

It may not seem like much weight gain to some, but for me it is. My stomach looks very flabby/pudgy and I lost any self confidence I had. 
I don't like to see myself undressed anymore, or let my partner to see me without clothes on either. Most of the time I feel like I look pregnant. (I am not) üòÖ

I started working from home around the time the weight gain started happening. (Go figure, huh)
I sit about 8+ hrs at a desk in my home. 
I also developed a habit of drinking coffee since starting this job. 
The coffee I drink is made with 2 or 2.5 tablespoons of sugar and 1 tablespoon of coffeemate coffee creamer. 
I was drinking this about 3 times a day for the last year, but I was able to lower it to once a day.
 
I'm aware of how bad this is for me, but I've been struggling to kick the habit of drinking it. 
I struggle with very low energy on a daily basis and use coffee as a crutch. 
I'm not sure how to completely break this habit as I know it is bad for me. 

I was recently diagnosed(2 months ago) with PCOS and a Fibroid, I'm currently on birth control to manage them. 

I have tried to eating healthy on my own(without my partner or kid being onboard) 

I tried eating scrambled eggs in the morning 
Chicken tenderloins (homemade) for lunch (about 2 or 3) 

Rice + chicken for dinner but haven't seen any significant change in my stomach area so I stopped. 

Now: 

My diet recently usually consists of me skipping breakfast and drinking the coffee I mentioned above. 
My lunch is either frozen pizza, or take out, etc or I may skip lunch. 
Dinner is usually (white) rice + chicken tenderloins.

1jvgmvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1jvgmvi/my_history_and_success_jury_out_but_trending/,My history and success (jury out but trending positively?!)...,"Hi all.

When I was about 13/14 I started getting stomach cramps. The usual IBS-C types of pain followed by relief. I was given some small chewable white chalky pills by my doc then and used to chew it to likely no relief. My father and aunt had some stomach issues and figured it was ""just in my genes"". 

Fast forward 25 years or so, and I had a hernia operation and instead of the usual way they correct it I had the ""patch"" surgically inserted. Healed up the hernia but I started having some blood in my stool. Figured it was side effects from surgery and perhaps too much/not enough miralax combined with the pain meds that constipate you. Went to the doc and got diagnosed with a c-diff diagnosis. Took a few drugs to alleviate, and eventually the blood went from daily to once a month give or take. Nothing to be overly scared about but still concerning just enough right? Not to mention Id sit on the toilet for 20, 30, 45, 60 minutes even in order to feel empty.

Then a few years after that the blood started coming back more regularly. Saw a doc, then another and then another, and got diagnosed with an internal hemorrhoid. One doc tried to rubberband it, but that didnt work after a day. Again ithe blood seemed to mostly recede to about once a month or so, but I still had IBS-C enough to where you always worry if tyou dont go for 1-2 days that it be painful enough to reaggravate the bleeding. Finally concerned enough that I had a colonscopy in the Fall of 2019, and luckily no dreaded cancr or otherwise, but the doc said yep, you have an internal hemorrhoid but otherwise good.

After that, my poops were never fully solid nor full liquid but what I called ""soft serve"" consistency. And I started getting the blood every single day or close to it, and started getting what I called ""leakage"" at first. Mucus, water, sweat, blood, tiny tiny remnants of stool etc. after finishing at the toilet. Potantially embarrassing and definitely disgusting. I started using the toilet and then sitting on a folded up couple pieces of tp on top of the toilet for an extra 10 min to make sure it didnt come out in my shorts and then pants etc. But that didnt always work and I know there were some times I felt a wetness in my shorts and was like...ugh, I either have to change my shorts or go to the barthroom or both. 

Tried everything you can think of...tons of fiber. Maalox. Drinking tons of water. Quitting coffee and alcohol. Triphala. Apple cider vinegar. Extra iron. Lightly adhering tro FODMAP. Lots of ginger, kombucha. Probably more stuff but I dont even recall anymore. All kinds of things I thought were healthy, couldnt hurt, maybe Id poop more often and itd heal the blood issue. And Id build up what I felt were tolerances to each drug or method as they seemingly worked for a week or two and then itd return with a vengeance.

Then someone on here mentioned something a month ago and I said f it, cant hurt, and its not bad for you. So I ordered two bottles online:

Vitamin B-12 (dm me for link to actual product if you want)

L-Glutamine 

  
Since then I have had to go the bathroom almost every single day and sometimes twice a day. They have been solid. I have had no blood. The mucus has reduced about 80%, the overall ""leakage"" reduced about 90%.

Its only been a few weeks so plenty of time to get my dreams shattered...but...if you have similar symptoms and want to give somethingf different a try, go for it. Because so far, so good.

And I still eat pizza, ice cream, sushi, burgers, pasta, ham and cheese sandwiches, coffee, wine, beer, cocktails, candy, whatever, no issues. I feel like maybe just maybe my life is back or at the very least...improved dramatically.

As I approach the end of my weight loss phase and the beginning of my maintenance phase, I'm setting boundaries of what I'm willing to do vs. not willing to do for the rest of my life to maintain my weight. 

Here's what I want maintenance to look like for me:

* I can eat two healthy and satisfying meals each day (in the range of 400-600 calories each) consisting of mostly unprocessed/minimally processed foods, have room for a protein shake for macro balancing (\~200 calories), and have 200-300 calories allotted most days for treats that might be highly-processed or less healthy but bring me enjoyment (or use those 200-300 calories toward the occasional bigger meal - see below) - so around 1600-1800 calories/day
* I can enjoy eating out once a month without obsessing over the calorie content of the meal, choosing the lowest-calorie option on the menu, or making the restaurant meal the only thing I eat that day (these days I eat half a restaurant meal by default, take the other half home for a second meal later on, weigh it on my food scale, and use ChatGPT to estimate its calories and macros based on weight and description)
* I can indulge rather than restrict or miss out on special occasions (birthdays, holidays) a few times a year

This is what I'm willing to do to maintain my weight long-term:

* exercise 5 days/week for around 30 min each time, including a mix of cardio and weight training, and take at least 1 full rest day each week (knowing that TDEE-wise, this'll land me between ""sedentary"" and ""light exercise"", based on recent analyses)
* spend 2-3 hours each weekend meal-prepping healthy recipes on weekends, weighing and measuring all ingredients
* weigh myself daily and adjust my calories if my weekly averages trend upwards
* accurately log my food intake daily
* calorie cycle for planned indulgences (i.e., if I know I'm going to have a big, 1000-calorie Thanksgiving dinner, eat 100-200 calories less than usual the days before and after)
* continue intermittent fasting and omit breakfast, though in a more relaxed way (I currently do 20:4 or 19:5 most days; would like to relax this to 18:6 or even 16:8 depending on the day)

This is what I'm NOT willing to do:

* stay at 1200-1500 calories/day long-term in maintenance (given my gender, height, and age, this likely means I won't get smaller than a US women's size 6/8, and I'm fine with that)
* exercise 7 days/week with no rest days or for >1 hour/day (speaking from past experience -- I did this for years, often spending 1.5-2 hours/day on cardio at the gym and never taking rest days, and it was not healthy for me mentally or physically)
* wake up at 5 AM to exercise (also speaking from past experience)
* log 10,000+ steps/day every single day (also speaking from past experience)
* never eat out
* never eat dessert
* sacrifice all flavor from food I enjoy so that it's low(er) calorie (also speaking from experience - there are only so many tweaks you can make to your favorite coffee shop order before the drink tastes totally different in a bad way)

It would feel strangely ordinary. A morning like any other, where the sun rises unaware that no one may be left to greet it tomorrow.

Some would still be making coffee. A child might be laughing at something small. Someone would be scrolling through messages, someone else sitting at a desk, unaware that it's the last time their fingers will type on keys.

In cities, lights would flicker as systems shut down. In nature, the animals would notice first‚Äîquiet changes in the air, a stillness that isn‚Äôt quite right.

Some would pray. Some would hold hands. Some would still be in denial. And others would forgive‚Äîfinally‚Äîforgive themselves, each other, the world. There would be a strange tenderness among strangers, a kind of sacred pause in the chaos.

Some would record last messages in notebooks, on phones, on walls. Some would sing. Some would scream. And some would just *be*‚Äîwatching the sky, letting it hold them as it always did.

The last day of humanity would not be about *how* we end‚Äîbut *who* we are at the end.

Back when I was in college I'd spend entire days at my college's library cafe. I loved the movement, easy access to both sweet desserts and savory meals, I liked that it was both quiet, but almost constantly had lots of movement and action. Great place to study, read a book, play Steam Games, or just hang out. I miss it. It had carpet flooring and a very cozy vibe.

Does anyone know of a place in Austin that matches a description like this? I think the most important is that if it could have lots of movement but still quiet and cozy that would be awesome. 

I want to steer clear of places that feel cold or have a ""modern industrial"" design. Bars are often popular afternoon spots but none are cozy.

I also want to avoid drinking more coffee in the afternoon or drinking alcohol. My afternoon drink of choice is a nice Coke Zero. From the plastic bottle is best. Love the hiss.",3,1744231682.0,austinfood,2,0.67,False

[1000-1500‚Ç¨]i,"Recently I bought a Profitec 400 pro HX machine. I love the build quality and the workflow, but since I got it I constantly get too sour or too bitter shots. 

My shots look like every recomendation out there: 18g in 1:2/2,5 ratio, with wdt and puck screen in an 18g dual layer basket with a blind portafilter(no signs of channeling). I have experienced with several extraction times, from 20‚Äù to 35‚Äù. I even played with the PID options built in the machine.
I always use fresh locally medium dark roasted beans.

I forgot to mention that i always flush the grouphead before brewing.

Do you think it is due to lack of thermal stability? Or am I missing something?

I normally drink 2/3 flat whites every day. I started my coffee journey around 3 months ago, and I support the idea of buy once, cry once.

Another question, would you consider returning my profitec 400 pro and look for a dual boiler machine(I‚Äôm open to recomendations), or would you look for a grouphead thermometer to see what‚Äôs going on during extraction?

I can return it until the 20th this month

As a 26yo woman living alone with a sedentary job, on weekdays, I typically drink instant black coffee to stave hunger, eat one large meal for lunch (1200-1400kcals), and then have a lighter meal + dessert for breakfast/dinner (400-600kcals). Saving on weekday meals allows me to spend a little bit more on going out with friends ($20+ per cocktail in NYC after tax & tip), treating my boyfriend on dates (usually $90-$110 for 2 people), and lunch out ($15) as a treat on Saturdays after my driving lessons :)",32,1744231387.0,whatsinyourcart,4,1.0,False

I'm continuing the tradition of ‚Äúhelp me position my speakers‚Äù posts. I‚Äôm planning to buy a Samsung Q990D (or Q930D) soon, and I‚Äôm seriously wondering about the placement of the rear speakers.

I live in a house with a mostly open-plan ground floor. It‚Äôs a lovely layout, but not ideal when it comes to placing rear speakers. So I‚Äôve made an illustration to get your thoughts.

1. **Placement 1 (in red):** the speakers would be placed to the sides, and even slightly in front of our heads. 
2. **Placement 2 (in yellow):** the speakers would be very close to our heads, since my wife and I usually sit on either end of the couch. 
3. **Placement 3 (in blue):** the rear speakers would be about two meters behind the couch, but the left one would be somewhat ""blocked"" by the pellet stove. Doesn‚Äôt seem ideal either.



So here are my questions:

* Do you think any of these setups could work?  
* With the Q990D, it's possible to place the rear speakers at the front. For those who own one, can you tell me if it's possible to switch between front and rear speaker placement on the fly, with presets changing too (like having 2 presets saved for quick access)? (Or do you have to redo the room calibration each time?)  
* I‚Äôm not a fan of having wires and speaker stands all over the place ‚Äî I care a lot about interior design. So I‚Äôm also considering a permanent ‚Äú3.1‚Äù setup, with the surround speakers at the front. I‚Äôve got plenty of space on either side of the TV to widen the soundstage. For those who‚Äôve tried this kind of front-only setup with the Q990D (or Q930D), did you still get a decent amount of side/vertical spatialization (Atmos), or does it just feel gimmicky?  
* Could my shelf on the right interfere with lateral spatialization? (Note: the shelf has a frame at all four corners but is open on all sides.)

**Note:** I‚Äôm currently using a compact LG soundbar with an amp ‚Äî a pretty entry-level model from 2014. So in any case, this should be a big upgrade. :)

Thanks in advance for all your expert advice!

I am simply posting to request that if you are not actively using a desk in the quiet study spaces, you remove your belongings from said desk. You are not entitled to that seat/desk, it is not yours, and there are others who would very much like to use it whilst you are away at a lecture/lab/tutorial/social-event.

I understand that it is annoying to find a seat when you come back, but simply leaving your stuff there makes it harder for everyone else to do exactly that. During some points of the day, an easy 15%+ of desks on Lvl 4 Kate Edgar are inhabited by the belongings of some student who used the desk several hours ago. Not ok!!!

Going to the bathroom, or quickly grabbing a coffee? Yeah, alright, leaving your stuff there is fine. It's a pain to pack-up just to return in 2-5min. 

Going to a lecture, lab, tutorial, or otherwise? No, bad, take your belongings with you. The study desks are not an appropriate place for you to store your belongings.

Sat down at a desk the other day, I was positioned next to one of these 'student-less' desks. I was studying in the same spot for upwards of 5hrs, didn't once see the person who had laid claim to the adjacent desk.

Anyways, that's enough rambling. All I'm asking is that we all be more kind and considerate. Think of others. If nobody left their stuff on the desks, maybe it wouldn't be so hard to find a spot when you come back ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. UWorld: 70% done, 63% correct. Didn‚Äôt even finish my first pass. UWorld is the holy grail for USMLE. You can study First Aid and Mehlman and whatever else it is that people that study, a million times, but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve started studying for USMLE until you start UWorld. My method was to solve UWorld questions and then go through First Aid for the topics covered by the questions. I think this gave me a good foundation, and it also helped me hammer down the high-yield topics since I was seeing them over and over. In retrospect, would I say this was unnecessary and redundant? Idk, maybe. I only studied this way because it sounded like a good strategy in theory and I didn‚Äôt know too many people who had taken step 1 so I had to craft my own strategy. But I‚Äôm not complaining because I got good scores in all my practice exams and I passed! 

2. First Aid: I never read First Aid cover to cover. I just studied the topics I saw on UWorld, as I mentioned above. Doing this, I did end up going through high-yield concepts multiple times and I ended up skipping everything low-yield.

3. Mehlman PDFs: I highly recommend all of the PDFs. I wasn‚Äôt able to go through all of them, but I wish I had. Out of the ones I did read, I think the best ones are Arrows>Neuroanatomy>MSK>Endo>Renal. The rest were also good but these were clutch. Genetics was pretty good too. 

4. Sketchy: Used this for micro and pharm. I used the UWorld method here too. I would review the sketch for whichever bug or drug would show up in UWorld questions. Again, was it redundant? Maybe, but I‚Äôm not complaining. 

5. Pixorize: Used this for immuno and biochem. Used the UWorld method here too. 

6. Bnb: I watched around 70% of Bnb. 

7. NBMEs: I did NBMEs 25-31. I reviewed every explanation, including the wrong options‚Äô explanations. 

8. Free120: I only did the new one because of less time. I reviewed it using Bootcamp, but I didn‚Äôt like their explanations. I didn‚Äôt have any repeats, though I have heard that some people had 2-3 repeated from the old and new Free120s. 

9. I would recommend doing the NBMEs online because they provide a score report at the end showing your strong and weak areas. I was scoring low in CNS, MSK and biostats in the initial NBMEs so I targeted them and scored higher in subsequent NBMEs. 

Random thoughts:

1. I think it‚Äôs necessary to stop doing UWorld towards the end and shift all your attention towards the NBMEs because UWorld tries to trick you a lot and this will get you questions wrong on the NBMEs and step1. The NBMEs and step 1 are very straightforward, so doing NBMEs will teach you to think the way USMLE needs you to think. 

2. Towards the end, I started doing random UWorld blocks without actually checking my answers or reviewing any questions because I wanted to practice doing longer questions. I was worried the NBMEs weren‚Äôt preparing me for the exhaustion I would face during the deal AND BOY WAS I RIGHT. The level of fatigue that descended upon me as soon as I sat in front of the PC monitor was unreal. No NBME prepared me for that level of exhaustion, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because of the stress you feel during the real deal. I did all of my NBMEs under testing conditions but I think one major difference was that I did the tests in the comfort of my home. In retrospect, I should have probably gone to a library and done them. I think that would have pushed me out of my comfort zone and somehow replicated the test day fatigue I experienced. For step 2, I will definitely be simulating the 9 hour testing experience using uworld blocks. Again, I passed step 1 so is this necessary? Probably not. I just think I would have been for comfortable during the exam if I had. 

3. During the NBMEs, I would finish each block with 25-30 minutes left. During the Free120, I had around 10 minutes left per block. During step 1, I barely had 3-10 minutes left per block. I was scrambling to finish each block. Again, this was because of the stress and fatigue.

4. In case anyone is looking for a study plan, I can tell you how I would do things if I could back in time. I would probably go through all the bnb videos and read the corresponding FA pages. Then I would start UWorld and at around 50% qbank completion, I would read all the Mehlman PDFs and then do the remaining questions. I think I would do my UWorld spiral back method. After finishing 100% of UWorld, I would start the NBMEs and review each one thoroughly. Then I would take Free120 and sit for step 1. Is all of this necessary to pass? Absolutely not. I think this method would be great to score >250 if step 1 was still scored. Since it‚Äôs pass/fail, it might be a bit much. But hindsight is always 20/20.

5. When I started studying for step 1, I came on this sub to figure out how I should study. I saw posts talking about how scoring >65% is safe for step 1. I also saw a bunch of people, especially IMGs, scoring >70% and freaking out. Of course, I thought they were ridiculous and knew I would never be one of them. Fast forward a couple months and I was one of them. I was scoring >75 on all of my NBMEs but I was convinced I would fail and that I didn‚Äôt know any of the material. I even posted on Reddit about this (from a different account so it won‚Äôt be in the post history of this account) and I got downvoted to high hell. I didn‚Äôt understand this disconnect between my scores and my lack of confidence so I took a step back to try and figure out what was going on. I think a huge reason for this is that every country has its own education system (in this case, medical education) and the mistake we make as IMGs, is extrapolating our cumulative educational experience to USMLE, even though it‚Äôs a different country with a different system. Let me elaborate. In my country, you are provided with a textbook or notes and you are expected to know every line. When you sit for any exam, if you successfully answer every single question really well, you MIGHT pass (since our exams are not MCQs, they are written exams where each question is answered with written paragraphs). And if you do pass, you will probably be on the borderline of passing. If you know every single line in your textbook and answer every single question, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre going to fail anyway. I realized I was unknowingly extrapolating this to USMLE. I didn‚Äôt know every single detail in First Aid/UWorld/Sketchy/Pixorize/Mehlman/bnb/etc, so I thought my knowledge was lacking. The thing is you DON‚ÄôT need to know every single detail to pass step 1. I also extrapolated my med school exam experience of needing to answer every single question in order to maybe pass, to usmle. I felt like I was going to fail step 1 when I did the NBMEs because 1. I wasn‚Äôt confident about the answers I was picking (my lack of confidence on this front stemmed from the fact that my med school exams were straight up recall questions while step 1 questions are second order and third order concept application questions- again my mistake was extrapolating my med school experience to step 1) 2. I wasn‚Äôt able to solve 100% of the exam (contrast to my med school exams where I solved every single question because they were straight up recall questions). Once I realized that this is what I was doing and why it was wrong, I let go of my apprehensions and became very confident. So to my fellow IMGs who think they‚Äôre going to fail even though they have great NBME scores: no, you aren‚Äôt crazy, just a bit misguided. Trust your scores and UNDERSTAND the reason why you feel under-confident despite great scores. That‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôre gonna get over your apprehensions. You are not crazy!!! Trust your NBME scores. Good scores mean that you know the info you need to know. Learning from UWorld is very different from the way we are used to studying so trust that it‚Äôs teaching you what you need to know, even if that means you don‚Äôt know every detail mentioned in every resource, because again: YOU DON‚ÄôT NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING TO JUST PASS!

6. I had pop-ups during my exam and I was worried sick it would affect my exam somehow. I reported it to the Prometric staff and they assured me that it was not related to my exam and that it would not affect my exam. I emailed NBME anyway letting them know, didn‚Äôt want to risk it. Just putting this out there because I was looking for posts about similar experiences when it happened to me.

Exam day experience:

1. The exam was heavy on ethics.

2. I felt that Free120 was incredibly representative of the real deal. It was the most similar. In fact, I basically felt like I was just doing another Free120 during the exam. I found the Free120 question stem length to match the real deal very closely. In fact, I feel like there were some questions on Free120 that had longer stems than any of the questions I got on the real deal. The real deal has a mix of short, medium and long questions, but none of them were longer than any of the Free120 questions (of course this may vary from form to form).

3. I would highly recommend going through the tutorial a few days before the real deal so that you can skip the tutorial and add the tutorial time to your break time. 

 4. I truly felt that I answered almost 90% of the questions through elimination and educated guesses. I guess it goes to show that it‚Äôs incredibly important to center your prep around solving questions because I do believe that it gives you the skills you need to eliminate options and make educated guesses. I was only 100% sure about 4-5 questions. Do as many questions as you can: UWorld, NBMEs, Free120s. I wanted to review Mehlman PDFs towards the end of dedicated, but I didn‚Äôt get time to do that and I felt kind of bad about it, but when I sat for the exam, I realized that it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference. It was my test-taking skills, intuition, elimination and educating guesses getting me through it. Trust that you have learned the info you need to know.

5. Huge pro-tip is to Ctrl+C your CIN number so that you don‚Äôt need to waste time typing it each time you have to start the exam again. 

6. I packed protein bars, fruit, milk (coffee/tea doesn‚Äôt suit me), pbj sandwiches, nuts (almonds, cashews, walnuts), seeds and of course water. Ended up eating all of it.

7. You need to be very careful with your break time. During my practice exams, I would take a 5 minute break between blocks. That was my plan for the real deal too, but for some reason, every 5 minute break turned into a 10 minute break, even though it just felt like 5. I think is because of the time it took for the security check every time I walked out of the room. 

There was a lot more I wanted to mention in this write-up but this is all I can remember for now. If I remember anything else, I might drop a comment on this post. If anyone has any questions, ask away!

I have a super super low maintenance routine currently & i‚Äôd like to introduce niacinamide 10% + zinc 1%, while keeping everything super simple. 

26F, live somewhere very sunny, super freckly, some mild breakouts but mostly hormonal & around my t zone. 

Morning routine :
-First thing when I wake up, I wash with Nivea gentle cleansing milk, moisturise with aveeno.
-I then apply the TO caffeine serum and allow that to settle into my skin while i make coffee.
-Then maybe add a boots uk night moisturiser if i have time (i like how it makes my skin feel plumped), and finally F30 sunscreen

Evening routine:
-Micellar water to remove any eye makeup (i only use mascara and a tad of concealer anyway)
-Same nivea cleanser, twice if needed.
-Same Aveeno moisturiser OR loreal revitalift retinol once or twice a week. If the retinol then I might add moisturiser later if i don‚Äôt go straight to bed.

My key question is if i add niacinamide in the evenings, must i still moisturise afterwards or can it be the sole thing i use after cleansing?

I‚Äôd also be appreciative of any other recommendations!

My car had broken down for the second time in just as many months, and even though the mechanic told me that it would only take them a day, I was forced to ride the bus for the rest of the week.

I‚Äôm sure, if you ever had to do something like that, you know just how fucking pissed I was.

I had to get up an hour earlier every morning, yet I almost never made it on time anyway. Instead of picking up coffee along the way, I had to squeeze myself into what felt like a metal tube, filled with strangers and their smells.

If I left just on time, I somehow managed to arrive only half an hour later than I would have with my car.

I was cursing out some deity or another every single time I boarded that bus.

Between the rough driving, the noise and smells of other people, and the constant delays, I really thought I might either get fired or assaulted by the end of the week.

Let‚Äôs be honest here... it just doesn‚Äôt work... not having a car, I mean.

At least around these parts of the country.

Now... back to my problem.

It all happened, as I said, about three weeks ago. On a Thursday, to be exact.

I got out of work at just past five and sprinted through the city to get to the bus stop in time, already promising myself that I wouldn‚Äôt have to do that any more soon.

By the end of the week, I would have my car again, I told myself.

It would be smooth sailing from then on. Back to my old ways.

Well, I managed to catch the bus, drenched in sweat and completely out of breath, and the only reason I did so was because someone blocked the road for a minute or two, otherwise, it would have passed me by.

I was so thankful at that moment, yet I curse that person now.

When I boarded the bus, breathing heavily, it wasn‚Äôt nearly as full as it normally would be, which might have been a clue, I think.

This time, I even got a seat, although not one of the good ones, since I had to sit with my back to the driver and was looking at all the other people taking the bus, just like me.

So I took it and started staring out of the window.

The first ten minutes were completely normal.

Well... as normal as riding the bus can be. I watched some people in business clothes boarding and sitting down. They looked exhausted and I had to smile as I saw my own fatigue reflected in their faces.

A few kids came in the next stop, with music blaring from their phones. I don‚Äôt know if they don‚Äôt realize how much they bother the rest, or if they‚Äôre doing it on purpose.

Then an old man with a cane boarded, and kept holding it almost like a weapon as soon as he saw the youths.

You know... the normal circus, so to speak.

But that all changed at the sixth stop.

I know that, because I replayed what happened next almost constantly in my mind.

This guy boarded the bus, and I immediately felt that he was trouble.

He entered from the door in the back, slowly lumbering in, with his head tucked so it wouldn‚Äôt hit the top of the frame.

His brown coat was dirty. He wore an ill-fitting hoodie underneath. His jeans looked washed out and scraped and there were bandages on his right hand.

I know it‚Äôs not nice to say, but I immediately thought this guy would smell.

And he did.

Of tobacco, cheap booze, and rancid sweat.

The odor was so strong that I stopped breathing through my nose as I watched this man standing by the back door, slowly turning his head.

He looked rough. Everything about him just seemed off, somehow.

The hood he was wearing didn‚Äôt cover his greasy hair and those dark shades over his eyes made him look like a junkie.

Some small voice in the back of my mind already screamed at me to get up and walk out, but the prospect of arriving home even later made me stay.

I felt a kind of morbid fascination, I have to admit.

Watching this big, strange-looking guy standing there, swaying from side to side as the bus set off again...

Well... all of that disappeared the moment his gaze fell upon me.

He stopped turning and looking around the second he spotted me and our eyes met.

I could feel it, even if I didn‚Äôt see them through the shades.

It‚Äôs hard to describe what I felt at that moment. Fear? Yeah, but worse. My throat went dry in an instant and the stench seemed to invade my nose. I could feel my hands shaking and cold sweat breaking out all over my body...

Like a deer in headlights... or a mouse getting dropped right in front of a snake.

This terror gripped me and I immediately averted my eyes, even though every single part of my mind screeched at me that the damage was done already.

The man had spotted me, and I could hear the big, lumbering steps echoing around the bus as he slowly started to walk in my direction. Why didn‚Äôt I jump up then and run to the door by the bus driver? Would it even have made a difference?

I could feel him coming closer and closer. The stench was getting bad enough that I could taste it on my tongue.

This guy, he was heading for me, I knew, yet could do nothing but sit there and tremble.

His heavy steps reached the seat in front of me, and the woman who had been sitting there stood up.

I could smell his breath now too. The sour stench of rotten food.

He sat down across from me, just as the door opened, and I jumped up and ran.

Finally, my body had moved, had reacted to the oncoming danger, and even though it was far away from my stop, I just couldn‚Äôt bear it anymore.

I slipped out of the bus the moment before the door closed, almost stumbled, then dared to look back, and what I saw there, made my skin crawl.

The man was standing by the window, and staring out, directly at me.

I didn‚Äôt want to wait at the stop for the next bus. Somehow, I could feel this insane uneasiness... It felt like something told me that the man would get off at the next stop and come back here.

So I took an Uber home, paid the money gladly, and thought that with that, the whole episode would be over.

But no...

I still had to ride the bus the next day... taking an Uber once might have been fine, but I wasn‚Äôt about to pay a whole day‚Äôs wage just to get to and back from work...

The only thing I could think of, was starting my commute even earlier, then clocking out sooner. It‚Äôs not like my boss would mind, I told myself, and boarded the bus the next morning, a few minutes after six o‚Äôclock.

At first, I felt relief, when I got on and could see the bus being almost full of blue collar workers, all minding their own business in silence.

All would be well, I told myself.

How foolish. My happiness lasted around half an hour before we got to the part of the city where I had seen the guy.

The bus rounded a corner, and suddenly, I felt this strange feeling again.

Sweat was breaking out all over my body. I was hot and cold at the same time. My heart started racing and my lungs burned.

Completely overwhelmed, I looked up and saw it.

Him.

Standing at a street corner, a brown bag in his hand.

He was wearing the exact same outfit from last time, and his eyes, still covered by the shades, found mine immediately.

I don‚Äôt know how he recognized me, but he most definitely did. The moment he noticed I was in here, he dropped the bag and started to run after the bus. His big steps carried his massive body forward as we sped past.

A stop was soon coming up, I knew, and felt this fear and dread already gripping my heart again.

What did he want?

Why was he chasing me?

Had I insulted him in some way? Provoked him?

I don‚Äôt know... I can‚Äôt say...

All I could do was press my face against the window to look at and watch the man racing after the bus that would soon stop to let people out.... and in.

The vehicle came to a squealing halt and I wanted to scream.

I had lost sight of the man, but I was sure he was still running toward me. Somehow, I could feel it. His presence... The fear and terror that had gripped me told me to run and hide myself, but I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt make it far out there.

So I stayed in the bus, shaking and trembling like a child having a nightmare, as the sound of heavy steps coming down the road grew louder and louder.

I wanted to scream at the driver to go...

I wanted to duck and hide...

I wanted...

The stench hit me suddenly, and I could have broken down on the spot.

Tobacco, alcohol, sweat.

It invaded the bus and almost made me retch.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him. The big, lumbering figure sprinted full speed down the sidewalk.

The door was still open.

I wanted to cry.

He would get on the bus, I knew, at that moment, and contemplated jumping off.

Suddenly I heard the doors falling shut and felt the engine starting up, just as two massive hands hit the side of the bus in frustration.

The driver cursed but drove off, and as I looked behind, I could see the man standing there, out of breath, while his eyes still followed me.

To say I was useless at work that day would be an overstatement. I was a nervous wreck the whole time and my boss told me to leave early since I wasn‚Äôt managing to do much anyway...

Thankfully, I thought, I needed to get on another bus that day, which would take me to the service center, to finally get my car back.

What I didn‚Äôt expect was that as soon as I walked over to the bus stop, that smell suddenly hit me.

I was standing in a crowd of people and couldn‚Äôt move.

The stench was here.

So strong.

Luckily, the bus came just a few seconds later, and I boarded it without a problem, but as soon as we drove off, right in the alley next to the stop, I saw him again.

And he saw me.

The fear gripped me, even though I knew he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get to me that time...

He started to run, but the bus drove off and deeper into the city.

Shit...

I should have noticed it back then. The fact that the bus stop I had been waiting at was so close to my work... This strange guy was slowly but steadily finding me.

Maybe if I had just left then and there, I would have been able to get away from him?

No... I don‚Äôt think so.

Something is wrong here... with him, or me...

Whatever the case... I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how elated I felt as I got in my car again... I would have taken any kind of trade-in as well.

All I wanted was to be able to drive on my own once more.

To leave public transportation behind, and with it, that man...

Well, I was wrong.

Not even a day later, I stopped at a gas station, miles away from where I worked, opened the door, then froze.

There it was again.

That stench, followed by the terror I always felt.

A shadow seemed to fall upon me as I looked up and saw a figure, standing by the side of the building, staring at me.

He was grinning widely as he started to run.

I threw my door shut and put my foot down, shooting out of the station and into traffic.

Luckily, I didn‚Äôt crash, because as I looked into the rearview-mirror, I could see the man running along the sidewalk again.

I don‚Äôt know what I did to him, or how he manages to pop up wherever I go...

Over the next few weeks, I saw him almost daily.

Sometimes lingering around the street where my company is, other times, waiting by the road.

Twice I had to drive off as I had stopped at a red light when I suddenly saw him appear from one of the alleys...

He‚Äôs coming closer, I can feel it...

Sometimes at night, I wake up with this dread in my chest.

I‚Äôve talked to the police, but they can‚Äôt help or don‚Äôt want to help, since my description seems off...

I even got myself a gun, but I don‚Äôt know if it will be enough...

I‚Äôm so fucking scared all the time...

Right now, I‚Äôm staying in a hotel, since last night, I saw the figure from my window, walking around the streets out there.

I think he knows where I am...

He can find me anywhere... No matter where I run, no matter what I do...

Even in my nightmares, he appears.

I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt rest.

The gun is next to my laptop right now...

There‚Äôs this stench in the air, coming from outside my room...

Oh God...

Freaking out!,"Hello all, I'm 19M and l've been experiencing palpitations for as long as I can remember, and aside from some rough patches where they were very frequent, they don't phase me. However, about an hour ago I was just sitting still and felt the thud of a PVC, and then my heart rate shot up maybe to around 160 and they all felt like uncomfortable PVC beats. It was over as fast as it started, only experiencing about 4-5 of these fast beats before my heart went back to normal. 

I‚Äôve done 2 ECGs before which both had completely normal readings, although I‚Äôm annoyed that both didn‚Äôt catch any of my irregular beats, which is why I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm experiencing PVCs or PACs etc. My palpitations just feel like a double beat with a pause.

This has never happened to me before and now I'm just spiraling waiting for it to happen again. I'm prescribed 10mg propanolol on an as needed basis, and have felt normal since taking it about an hour ago after it happened. Just want any insight as to what this might be and if I should follow up with a doc? I'm thinking possibly NSVT? One thing to note is that l've tried cutting caffeine and very rarely have it, and today I accidentally forgot to order my coffee decaf, which I suspect may be the culprit.

I currently own a la pavoni europiccola bought second hand (originally purchased early 2000''s). I purchased for $350 and it had no maintenance too it. Replaced O-rings, steam wand, add a pressure gauge on top of sight glass and swapped for a brass bottomless portafilter with a 20gram basket. Eventually I purchase a Z1presso grinder. Over time I tried to dial it in and I just never had success. I decided recently to give it another shot, I have had some success recently and it is refreshing to say the least. Though, I think I want something a litte more hands off. I still like the mechanical feel of the pavoni and it pains me to consider selling it. Here are my thoughts, I use the money I get from selling it to buy a new machine orI keep it and continue to learn the machine, while also throwing a little more money into as time goes on or I sell it and pocket the money. 

Now the machine I have found that would still give me that ""lever pull"" feeling is the Turin Gallatin. I am still in very early consideration though. Now I don't drink coffee everyday, mainly because it takes forever to pull a shot on the pavoni (user error, not the machine). I would like something that stays on and is pretty much ready to go when I need it. I do like that I can connect it to a water line as well. 

If anyone has used a Gallatin please let me know what you think about it. On the other hand what is a good compromise? I would consider buying a cheaper machine to test whether I would use it enough before making the jump to a machine of that caliber. ",2,1744229633.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

You can turn a random idea into a logo, a room layout, a fashion concept, or even a full-on album cover in minutes. Don‚Äôt know how to draw? Doesn‚Äôt matter. Don‚Äôt have a design background? Still doesn‚Äôt matter. You just need an idea and a few words.
